(I'm in trader mode in the Bazaar)<br />
Obvious_newbie is browsing your wares.<br />
Obvious_newbie bought Tailored Quiver token<br />
Obvious_newbie tells you 'How do I use this thing?'<br />
(Explanation follows, and O_n gets his quiver)<br />
Obvious_newbie tells you, 'Where are the arrows?'<br />
You tell Obvious_newbie, 'You have to fill it yourself.  I just sell the quiver.'<br />
Obvious_newbie tells you, 'That's such a rip!  You owe me arrows!'<br />
You tell Obvious_newbie, 'I just sell the quiver.  You have to fill it with your own arrows.'<br />
Obvious_newbie tells you, 'Well, I'm telling my guild not to buy your stuff!'<br />
(I notice he's not anonymous, but has no guild tag)<br />
<br />
Maybe fifteen or twenty minutes pass, and (drumroll please...)<br />
<br />
Obvious_newbie tells you, 'Can you rez me in Crushbone?'<br />

Ahem.<br />

/guildsta Name also works if the person is in the same zone with you. Otherwise I do /who all Name and see if they're anon or not. <br />

Heheheheheheheheh !!! <br />
No more Chaucer! Just going to cut my losses and skip the, um, two weeks I was behind. <br />
<br />
But he is correct. There is much that is preferrable to Chaucer. ^_^<br />

<br />
Guy wanna buy it for 1/4 of the price, and when i tell him no, he threated to OOC about me being a scammer and tell his guild never to buy my stuff and so on.<br />

He probably meant the ranger guild :p</div></div><hr />

Oh, no!  You're right!  Right after he did this to me, I tried selling some stuff to the ranger guildmaster in Rivervale (well, he is right by a regular merchant, and I click clumsily sometimes) and he wouldn't even speak to me!<br />
<br />
What have I done?!?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would have told him he had to put the token in the quiver to make arrows...oh but he turned the token in?  Better /petition because something got messed up...he should have gotten it back with the quiver!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I wish I could craft a story one tenth as perfectly as &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot; is crafted!</div></div><hr />
