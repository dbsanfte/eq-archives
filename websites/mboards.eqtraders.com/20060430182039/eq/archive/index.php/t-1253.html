However, when reading the FAQ it said this-<br />
&quot;Q: What stat helps me raise smithing the fast? <br />
A: Wisdom, Intelligence or Strength - whichever is highest.&quot; <br />
Which one of these is right?IF eqtraders says this then i'm pretty sure it is probably right, but so many people have said different so i'm not sure.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You said: &quot;I have heard from many people that the highest of str, wis, or intelligence is what gives you your success rate &quot;<br />
<br />
Sucess rate is based directly on your skill rating, not any of str, wis or int.<br />
<br />
However, str, wis and int does affect the rate at which you get skill ups. The higher skill you have the less failures you will see.</div></div><hr />

Got 5 skillups over 75 combines with focus of soul on taking my str over 200,  but then turned around and got 14 skillups on 133 combines completely unbuffed with about 150 str. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really a statistically significant sample. The RNG is very fickle. You'd have to do thousands of combines to really see a pattern  :!:</div></div><hr />
