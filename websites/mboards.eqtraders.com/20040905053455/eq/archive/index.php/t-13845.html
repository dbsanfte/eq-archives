<br />
For the info of those Gnomes considering doing some tinkering and who also like (very boring) quests...<br />
<br />
If you talk to Skelontorim Orrthemech (one of the tinkering merchants) he will ask you to make some springs for him AND will give you the (single) ingredient to be combined. The trivial for the combine is listed in the UI as 31 - which matches the similiar Tailoring quests (they progress through a number of items until the final one which has a trivial of 54).<br />
<br />
Sadly, since we gnomes start with a skill of 50, making 100 springs then 100 of the next item until you get to the fourth which will presumably trivial at 54, does not seem worthwhile.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to try this out, hand the products back to Skelontorim unstacked!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Read the front page- tis linked in new quest section already...this is part of the freebie skill up part- working faction too with dem traders...ders a collection part too similar in nature...and ye learn some new skills from these...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rainingdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My tinker-bot did this today - 300 combines and hand ins - and was told I now have the secret of Dark Matter - mwahahaha!<br />
<br />
He went on to say that the Dark Matter is used in crafting the new batteries. Im wondering if the replace the old batteries like for like or whether they are for new combines or maybe make the same items chargeless. We will see. Somebody told me that the dark matter was foragable in Natimbi, can anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a thread in the database updates section listing the forages found in Natimbi after 2 hours, http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13904, it lists &quot;Darkmatter Dust&quot; which is probably not used to make Darkmatter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erikanudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, do the grunt work combines and you learn how to convert Raw Dark Matter to Dark Matter. And how to convert the Raw Infused Dark Matter into Infused Dark Matter.<br />
<br />
1 Dark Matter yields 5 Darkmatter Dust, I imagine the same for Infused.<br />
<br />
1 Darkmatter Dust + Battery Casing 1 = 1 Class 1 Battery.<br />
2 Darkmatter Dust + Battery Casing 2 = 1 Class 2 Battery.<br />
.... etc up to being able to make Class 5 battery.<br />
<br />
Class 6 Batteries are made from Infused Dark Matter.<br />
<br />
So, after doing the 400ish n00bie combines, you learn the secret to produce Dark Matter/Infused Dark Matter.<br />
<br />
Of course, you need to do alot of your own conversions to get your conversions to yield 3.<br />
<br />
End Result of Quest is the ability to make Mana Batteries for about 20% of the cost to buy them from a vendor (since you need to buy the battery casing).<br />
<br />
I sure hope there's other uses for Dark Matter besides batteries.<br />
If it's such a strong power source, it'd be nice to make Anizok items that don't need recharging, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did the quest and he whispered into my ear how to use dark matter, but no new recipes showed up in my interface.<br />
<br />
I know I can pull the recipes off this site, but how do you get them in game? He didn't actually give me the recipes in game, it just said he whispered in my ear how to use dark matter. What did I do wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SilverfurMangycoat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think you have to still do the combine on your own, once, before it will show up in your list (it's probably marked CanLearn).<br />
<br />
Before he whispered it in your ear, you weren't able to even attempt the combine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Handed in to Tialechaety 1 dark matter ( I got 2 from handing in 1 dark matter to Skelontorim) and she gave me a book listing the recipes for dark matter and batteries made from it. She also gave me 10 scraps of dark matter and 10 simple gauze presses to combine into Wayfarers Gauze Presses.<br />
   I'm a 250 tinkerer. The combine she had me do lists at 31 trivial. Tell me there's not more to this quest and I can stop now before doing zillions of combines?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at the price of raw dark matter in Stromm's bazaar.<br />
<br />
On Stromm there are some people trying to sell raw dark matter at 70pp a pop.<br />
<br />
You have to wonder if some people ever bother to research their items before they set a price. No-one in their right mind is going to pay that. Ah, well it's good for a chuckle and if they have thier traders satchels full of massively overpriced stock they have less space to sell goods in competition with me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>menssia01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">70pp? gheee it's 2.5k to 3k on Vaz...ROFL...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xanafeldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Saryrn has been a little more reasonable, anywhere from 20-50pp.<br />
   I did notice one person listing 1 at 2kpp. /ooc laugh.<br />
<br />
No, I don't see many people bothering to look it up. Honestly, the rarity of the drop would lead some to think it's much more useful than it is.<br />
<br />
   Also, I finished up the quest using up dark matter. From what I see it reduced the number of combines by to about 10% of the other guy. She told me to tell him [lend a hand] and he whispered in my ear.<br />
<br />
   Yay, now I can get a random amount of dark matter from raw.... and... pile it up I guess.  Here's hoping there are undiscovered uses.</div></div><hr />
