Collapsable stuff is easy... been making them since early 180s with small amount of failures (would say 85 - 90 % sucess on about 100 or so)...

Just pm me or seek me (or Mantik) out in the channel with your request... <br />

I'll have to dig through my bags and see what it was I collected for you.  I'm once again at work without my notes, so I have to rely on my memory for what's in my bags.  Unfortunately, the contents of what I've collected is escaping me.  I will be signing on tonight, and will inventory what I have and who it's for.  If I don't catch the intended folks, I will post the names and items here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jaeden,<br />
<br />
I still have those Zombie Skins for you.  I'm not quite to the point of being ready for Leather Padding, but I could store it for when I'm ready.  There's no obligation, but I rarely reject offers of supplies.  The Zombie Skins are yours, reguardless. (Unless you've skilled passed 188 already. ;))<br />
<br />
Goresmash,<br />
<br />
I have the Mt Death Mineral Salts for you still.  It's not a lot of them, but I have a couple floating around.<br />
<br />
Cylinor,<br />
<br />
I still have the Griffenne Blood and Mugs of Sea Foam for you.  Again, it's not a lot, but it's still another attempt or two.<br />
<br />
Lunira,<br />
<br />
Do you still have the Kunzar Koi?  I'd be very interested in it if you still do.  Let me know what you'd like in exchange for it, please.<br />
<br />
Ever &amp; Jmorgana,<br />
<br />
I still have eggs available.  Would either of you be interested in them?  I have a few Snake, Aviak, and Basiliks, if memory serves.<br />
<br />
I should be around tonight, after 11:30pm EST.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Golden Idols are down to 700pp. :(<br />
<br />
Star Ruby Steins are rare again and up around 250-330pp! :)<br />
<br />
In other words... I could use a few. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ever</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I don't need anymore eggs, I have stacks upon stacks of dragon and wurms from my foraging and plenty from you guys =)  I should be good for a month at the most since im at 230 or so in baking</div></div><hr />

I'll lacquer up a few gems and start with steins again.  Wish the planar peridot steins would sell again.  I have a few lacquers and a few unfired steins looking for homes.<br />
<br />
Jaeden,<br />
<br />
If I had a cp for every time I got called KhaarG, I'd have at least enough for an iron ration. :)  Don't sweat it, really.  It will just make sending me tells harder.  Use KhaarQ instead.  :D</div></div><hr />

Oh, and I hope that guildie wasn't Darkleaf. :D   (Darkleaf is my RL brother, and a guild member of House Kel'Dar)</div></div><hr />

Anyone got any oak bark?</div></div><hr />

First off, congratulations on trivialing Wu's!  I've been working on it off and on myself.  If you still have the HKs and VMs, I'd be interested in them.  Let me know what you want for them, and we'll set up a meet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got :<br />
1bd (gammy you still looking?)<br />
6 Hero parts<br />
6 Blood raven parts<br />
1 essence of sunlight <br />
3 iron oxides<br />
and a couple of tinkering things already claimed.<br />
<br />
The baking things are up for grabs for whatever baker is interested. All I need is the cost back (the parts cost like 1.5 pp a piece) Though I have two hobgoblin meats and I would really like a hobgoblin surprise......<br />
<br />
I also have 3 permafrost crystals in the bank and would be willing to trade those plus the iron oxides to some potter and whatever else to get a golden idol of tunare. (I am trying to collect all the gifts for a Valentines present to my boyfriend)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qallainx</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Allayne,<br />
<br />
If you could spare the baking items, I will buy them for ya... either that or I can try the combines and give ya the finished products, whatever works for you... As for hobgoblin surprises, I can make ya those... (not 250 yet, but usually more than 50% successful)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allayne</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am happy with either option. I snatched them up for fellow tradeskillers as my baking is around 160 and I don't intended to GM it any time soon. Figured someone could use them  :D <br />
<br />
I'll take you up on the offer to combine the hobgoblin surprise too.  <br />
<br />
Thanks much!<br />
I'll keep an eye out for you in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ever</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too bad I missed out on those baked goods, havent even seen a Hero Part since recipe went in as verified lol, I have 15 i think hobgoblin meats as of lates, been getting them at 10pp each lately. Dinged 60 too! And 4th aa!</div></div><hr />
