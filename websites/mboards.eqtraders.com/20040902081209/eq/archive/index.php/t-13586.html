<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ambertha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided that I would like to try this relatively inexpensive (6.434 pp per combine for me) but bulky (4 unstackable items) and non sellback (vendors offered 9 cp per kit) route at skill 146 in my smithing career.<br />
<br />
I did 59 combines (failed on 3 or 4) and recieved 13 skillups. <br />
<br />
It took me 2 hours including travel time and a bit of chatting. I bound at the mithril vendor in felwithe, and would run to the gfay zonline, then egress to the spot by P.O.D. lift.<br />
<br />
Just in case anyone was thinking about doing these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jannelle Silverthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure if I have logs of it but that's the method I used to get smithing to 163 prior to brute forcing the armor for the 8th shawl. It's a space consuming but relatively cheap, fast method of raising smithing for wood elves since everything is vendor purchased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ah thanks! I have been planning to do this for a few weeks now but all that unstackable stuff has put me off. it was on my to-do list to figure out where egress went in Kelethin. Was debating binding at the firepots again =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This will take you all the way up to 163, and allow you to completely bypass ornate.  It's definitely worth it.  It takes just a bit of running back and forth between Felwith and Kelethin, but that's a small price to pay for how cheap it is to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think these containers are the unsung heroes of the smithing skill path.  I drove myself to 162 making Vale sewing kits, and I strongly suggest that anyone who can build these containers do it.  I'm a 190 smith now, and I've never built a piece of banded or ornate chain armor in my life.  It's cheap, it's easy, and if you're one of the the classes that can move magically, you'll do well to make these until they provide no more benefit.  And even better, since they sell for peanuts, you can make many, many friends by announcing to the zone that you're building them, and let all the new wood elves come get a free container.<br />
