<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prosik</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I have stumbled onto a bug on windows XP. Currently running XP pro SP1 and when I am killing monsters and or tradeskilling I don't think I am increasing skill on failures. <br />
<br />
Please help me verify this. I am 99% sure this is the case. Just wondering if anyone can verify this and or duplicate it on XP it should not make a difference if its SP 1 or not but only through searching and duplicating will we find out. I know Win98 works fine you can learn on failures.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

I'm using Windows XP Home, and I learn on failures. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandaie</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, in case you have not figured it out yet, failure or success on tradeskills or anything like that are all server side. It would be far too easy to exploit if a clientside difference like the OS affected it.</div></div><hr />

About the only thing your OS will affect is how stable EQ is (ie, how crashfull or crashless)</div></div><hr />

Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
SOE's servers don't care what your OS is.  They don't care what sound card you use.  They don't care who manufactures your hard drive.  They don't care what MP3s you listen to.  They don't care what processor you have.  All that matters is where the RNG stops in its lovely little cycle when you hit &quot;Combine&quot;.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I'm on XP, and I've noticed NO skillup problems.  In fact, from what I gather, my skillup arc from 200 to 250 was pretty swift for someone with only 216 WIS.  =)</div></div><hr />

Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
I place the blame on... Lag.<br />
<br />
Example:  My trader-mule buys a ton of Spiderling Silks in the Bazaar.  Never trained Tailoring, never did a combine previous to this point.<br />
When I started combining to make threads in the Bazaar, the lag was terrible and I got 1 skill-up after maybe 27 combines.  Once I zoned into Shadowhaven, I was getting skill-ups after every 5-8 combines.<br />
<br />
Take it as you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitely believe in the lag conspiracy.<br />
<br />
<br />
While it DOES happen, I feel like I get less skill ups in a lag situation than not.  I blame this not on lag directly, but what I call priming the RNG.  I'm a big believer in a zone wide RNG.  I get more successes if I wait until I hear the casino's calling &quot;WINNER!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you click my sig, you'll see my skill up chart.  Long streaks of no skill ups are almost ALWAYS done in the evenings, 10 combine 3 skill up runs are almost all done in the morning before work.<br />
<br />
It may be just in my head, but I'll always do expensive combines in non-Luclin zones because I just don't know which shares with the bazaar.  Thurg is nice and quiet, I also like doing combines in Misty.</div></div><hr />
