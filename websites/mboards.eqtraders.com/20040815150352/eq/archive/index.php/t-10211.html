<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jackofall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am going mental! I bought a stack of 10 pearls and had one SU. Thought that this was goung to be easy. The next step have been around 80 tries but no SU. :eek: <br />
<br />
I have INT 229 and a geerlock in hand. The fails are like 1 in 20 so the cost is not that bad. But the skill up is driving me mental and there is a downtime now since I need to enchant the bars for cost reasons.<br />
<br />
Is it necesery to raise int to 255 or will the rest of the road up be hell like this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not going to be easy or cheap.  It just takes persistence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just GM'd JC with my lvl 16 enchanter (average int was 192).  The worst run I had was 91 at 238.  Failures were low (at most 1 in 20, and usually 1 in 40).<br />
<br />
So, while it is better to raise your wis/int as high as possible, you can GM JC even if it isn't.<br />
<br />
hang in there - just bad RNG.</div></div><hr />
