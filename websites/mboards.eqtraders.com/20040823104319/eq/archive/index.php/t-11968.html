<br />
Since Make Poison is a Rogue class skill, is it Dex/Int/Wis or just Int/Wis like all the others (except Smith/Fletch).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm familiar with the FAQ, but at the same time, Poison Making is a class skill.  I am pretty sure they have stated Poison works off of Dex.  Even our tradeskill trophy has a bonus to dex on it.</div></div><hr />

I can assure you, DEX can be used. If you are ever unsure about such questions, camp, go to another server, create a character, and read the descriptions of the various stats (when you click on DEX look at the bottom of the screen).<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />

I really need to extract that text from the game itself and put it up. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just remember that just because SoE says it's so in their help text, does not make it so in actual fact.  I have no idea at all regarding DEX and poison making, it would certainly make a whole lot of sense to do it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turlo Lomon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Safehouse is confident DEX is used.  I, for one, trust that community in regards to poison.</div></div><hr />

42 skillups in 417 combines.  :D<br />

Then failed my GM Vial :(</div></div><hr />
