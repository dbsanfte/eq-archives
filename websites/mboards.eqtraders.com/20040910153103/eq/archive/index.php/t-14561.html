<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sorry for the extra post, but I was looking to catch the fish needed for the Fisherman Companion. I thought it was located in the POS but I realized it was in the Plane of Valor.<br />
Is there a safe way to fish in the Plane of Valor for a solo lvl 55?<br />
Also....I need to fish in Plane of Nightmare, is there a safe way to get to the water for a solo lvl 55 in PON? Once at the water in POV or PON, do you still get attacked by mobs?<br />
Thanks all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kulyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zone in, you have a zone wall behind you. Turn left or right (from where you are stood when you zone in), follow the zone wall until you see the water. If you go left, you will end up near the 'outer' camp which often has people at it kiting/killing the fiends. If you turn right, you'll end up at the water with some non-aggro frogs and will probably not see a single person or aggro mob while you fish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Kulyen<br />
<br />
zone in, head to south east corner, cross the river and fish from zone edge, you can fish there all you want.  People will have to train you on purpose for mobs to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kool...so I can safely fish POV....what about Plane of Nightmare.....anyway to safely get from zone-in to dock? And once at dock, do you get mobs aggro on you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rendael Brigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't go to the dock. <br />
<br />
IF what happened to me was just a one time fluke, I will suggest this:<br />
<br />
Get SOW and Lev. <br />
<br />
Run high off the cliff past the wolves, careful to avoid see invis trees and wolves.<br />
<br />
Land on the other side of the water on the hill past the slargs and before where the spiders spawn. You can fish at the end of the water there IF what happened to me was just a fluke:<br />
<br />
I rode HIGH above the water over the cliff at AA horse speed while invis.<br />
<br />
As soon as I landed and dropped horse, I was attacked ON LAND by two minnows.<br />
<br />
I could not attack them back other than running close to the shore and casting root.<br />
<br />
Good thing I had an insta gate potion on me.<br />
<br />
I bug reported this.<br />
<br />
I have fished here before for my own companion, but this time I have no idea how that event happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>fenedari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For nightmare I don't seem to have any trouble at all.<br />
Zone in. Go towards creek. The spot that has the two static spawns.<br />
As you are facing them, there is a rock to the left of them and a small widening in the creek.<br />
I fish there. I don't even bother with invis anymore.<br />
Just avoid the aggro range of the mob closest to the rock on your way to this spot.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />
