<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to recall in the quest for Brodder's Revenge the subject of beer battered onion rings or somesuch was brought up.  Perhaps now that we can actually make beer batter, it might be interesting what one might dip in it and cook up, aside from the already discovered set of eight or so recipies that is.  Who know, it might work.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunatly I don't have GoD (I found a bunch of tuna in PoK and made butter sauce from stuff in PoK for the buttered tuna recipie info I got), so I can't get the black pepper needed to make the stuff :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ravinred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll try that combine later today, I've got all the stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ravinred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Veggies + Beer-Batter doesn't work in a Mixing bowl..  haven't gotten near an oven yet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it was beer-battered onion rings then vegetables wouldn;t work. Why not try mixing onions and the beer-batter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always viewed the spiced tuna rolls as sushi, why not some tempura to go with it! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wasabi!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tempura batter would be <br />
  Rice flour ( suggest rice + motar n pestle)<br />
  Soda water (from making fizzlepop)<br />
<br />
 veggies need to be cleaned neh?<br />
  Suggest <br />
   Veggies x2 (bowl) = cleaned veggies<br />
   Cleaned veggies + knife in Bowl = Vegetable slices (lots)<br />
<br />
   stack of Sliced veggies + Tempura + WOk  = Tempura fried veggies !<br />
<br />
 Dats how I'd do it with current game tools, but then again, I'm not talking to devs anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Teaamillie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think there's some washed veggies in game already.....or something like that. The  PoK vendor has something like 'rinsed vegetables'?<br />
<br />
Maybe it was a dream! :wizard:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Washed vegetables can be found across from the brew barrel in the pok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tsbaity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always deep fry battered veggies, so maybe vegetable oil and a pot.</div></div><hr />
