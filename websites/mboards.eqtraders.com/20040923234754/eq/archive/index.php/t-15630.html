The item is not tagged for Tradeskills, it has no known use...but I hear rumors it is for Tradeskills. Any idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The item is not tagged for Tradeskills I think you answered your own question.</div></div><hr />

Not to derail, but the assumption that all tradeskill-used items are marked as such is absolutely FALSE.<br />
<br />
Also, the assumption that all items marked as tradeskill-usable actually ARE tradeskill-usable is either false or those missing recipes account for a fairly large amount of the 3000 undiscovered items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Clicking that logo at the top brings me to the main site with a handy search function at the bottom of the menu bar on the left.  Sticking in Ripened Mango pulls up the item info including a link for reverse lookup marked &quot;Find recipes that use this item&quot;.  Clicking that we get the message &quot;There are no known recipes that use ripened mango&quot;.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean that there aren't any, but no one has found a recipe and reported one here at EQTraders.  Ngreth and company put a lot of time into making the recipe database searchable and VERY VERY useful.  (Thanks as always!!! /cheer)  and Krazick and company has been extremely diligent about entering every detail reported on these boards as far as items and recipes (Again huge thanks and /cheer).<br />
<br />
Gentle reminder that the search function is very very useful and can answer a lot of questions very quickly about items and recipes including stuff like trivials where to find components and stats.  It gets updated very quickly whenever anyone find something new.<br />
<br />
/em exalts THE EQTRADERS DATABASE IS EXTREMELY USEFUL!!!!</div></div><hr />

Out of curiosity, what are some of the items used in tradeskills but not flagged as such?<br />
<br />
And many of the items flagged for use in tradeskills are actually for quests.  In particular, many items that are combinable in quest containers are flagged for tradeskills.  There are enough such items to be reasonably sure that they're flagged that way because of their quest container combines and not because they necessarily have an undiscovered tradeskill combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Up until a couple months ago Arctic Wyvern Hides were NOT flagged. I bugged it and a week later it was changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Suedyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I seem to recall that none of the fine steel weapons which can be smithed into ore in a forge are tradeskill flagged, nor are the rusty weapons which can be sharpened into tarnished versions in a forge.<br />
Maybe there is a field conflict? Items flagged as weapons, for instance, cannot also be flagged as tradeskill?<br />
Just a thought =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Im going to take a stab at a guess here.<br />
<br />
Theres 1 bit of data that indicates what type of item something is for each item.<br />
This bit of data is what is looked at for example when you use the /bazaar function and 'Select By Type'. <br />
1 - 1 Hand Slash<br />
2 - 1 Hand Blunt<br />
3 - 2 Hand Blunt<br />
etc..etc..<br />
Since there is only 1 bit for this info, you can not tag something for 2 different categories.<br />
<br />
Therefore, Fine Steel weapons cannot be tagged as tradeskill items because they already have the 1HS tag.<br />
Same goes for Short Sword of the Ykesha and others of the Ogre Cultural(??) weapon smithing combines.<br />
<br />
Food and drink must be a seperate bit of info because they CAN be tagged both as food and as tradeskill. (See a Misty Thicket Picnic for example)<br />
<br />
a quick scan of my bazaar shows a few items that fall under the 'Combineable' category that arent Tradeskill tagged.<br />
Quintessence of Knowledge (not really a combineable thing, its a reagent)<br />
Ethereal sheets/rings/swatches etc (also not really combineable as the 'forge'  you combine them in for Elemental/Ornate armor isnt really a forge, but a no-skill-check no-fail combiner. (Also, anything 'combined' solely in a glaze mortar (see Brodybeards reply just above this one), doesnt have a tradeskill flag, since theres no tradeSKILL involved))<br />
<br />
These items are probably in the combineable category because some dev game em that tag. They may/should be better in the 'Misc' category.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Have you also noticed a lot of strange items in the 1 Hand Slash category?<br />
<br />
Thats more than likely the data bit '0' or '1' which is the default. Any weirdo non-1HS item that shows up there probably didnt have that bit set properly by the person who created that item.  That would also explain why you ONLY see weird items in 1HS, and not in 1HB, 2HS, Peircing, Bows etc....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kieroth_whiteleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would *bet* that (and I haven't done *ANY* research so could easily be proven wrong) the tradeskill flag is a different field altogether, since it was introduced comparatively late in game development (within the last year or so?). Given that things like drinks can have tradeskill flags (and their &quot;type&quot; flag ought to be &quot;drink&quot; rather than &quot;1hs&quot;) I would bet that it's simply an omission when it doesn't occur in weapons rather than a database type conflict.<br />
<br />
Just an assumption based on how similar systems have worked though.<br />
<br />
SFG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorvari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tradeskills is a different field than the Item Type field.<br />
<br />
This is the Lucy link for the raw item data for Slice of Jumjum Cake:<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=9655<br />
If you look, it has an Item Type value of 14 (Food) and a Tradeskills value of 1 (used in tradeskills)<br />
<br />
I think 1HS is the default item type, which would explain why so many non-weapon items have that item type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It may have been corrected, but the last time I checked, one of the glaze ingredients (Foul Smelling Liquid or Putrid Ooze) for the Ceramic Skull Of Decay was not marked as a tradekill item. <br />
<br />
None of these pottery glazes are considered tradeskilled items. I assumed because it went into a Glaze Mortar (not a traditional tradeskill container.) And it is no fail, kind of making it a quested item, that is in turn used for a tradeskill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It may have been corrected, but the last time I checked, one of the glaze ingredients (Foul Smelling Liquid or Putrid Ooze) for the Ceramic Skull Of Decay was not marked as a tradekill item.<br />
<br />
foul smelling liquid is not tradeskill tagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I do hope they make a recipe for these eventually. I really want to make a Mango Chutney!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Confirmed today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Splunge I'm pretty sure that the &quot;Combinable&quot; tag in the Bazaar just means that its stackable, not that it's definitely used in a recipe of some sort. It's a very misleading term that they should probably chage in some way...How about &quot;Stackable&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Leiany</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The flagging or non-flagging of an item always tells only half of the truth. <br />
<br />
Rusty weapons have been mentioned allready as unflagged -and with a triv around 21 they can be considered  the BASIC stuff of smithing. <br />
<br />
Some other items are either for  class-exclusive TS (wolf hides/pelts/skins for poison vials p.e) or race-exclusive TS quests only (especially Vah Shir). In both cases they may be flagged but use- and valuless (even in the bazaar) to most....<br />
<br />
PS: yes mango-cuttney would be an addition  :chef:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bryan Williams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I believe that most, if not all, of the  Raw-hide armor is not tradeskill flagged.</div></div><hr />
