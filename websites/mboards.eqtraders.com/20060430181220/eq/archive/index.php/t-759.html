<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fearchar</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The more I read this site, the more it sounds like I made a mistake, but I created my barbarian beastlord with the specific idea of crafting the cultural armor for him. I thought I had it all figured out. I found a spot for Essence of winter, I found a spot for ivory. Not really high volume, but at least something. Some how when reading the recepies, I completely skipped over the blue diamond part. It will still be a long while before I can actually use them, but I was just wondering where the best place was to find them dropping. Right now I have been hunting shrieking substances while I still get experience off the wolves. I was wondering where to go for the blue diamonds. Thanks all in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I expect you'll find them for 500-600p each.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you won't get BDs until at least level 46 (doing Hate/Fear armour turn-ins).</div></div><hr />

You should have a solid group of around level 50s for them.</div></div><hr />

All the other stuff I have been able to get myself. Grouping for experience is one thing. Getting a bunch together just to maybe get me so diamonds is something else. Guess I will be stuck trying to buy them.  :&gt;)</div></div><hr />

A few weeks ago you would be lucky to see any priced at 500pp each.  Now, I see lots priced at 400pp and below.</div></div><hr />
