My gnome succeeded with three out of four Electrified Earring of Tempests combinations last night.  A 75% success rate!<br />
<br />
Jewelcraft is fixed!  Or maybe I just got lucky. :D<br />
<br />
Now, if people would just stop charging such silly prices for the PoP jewelery components, I might be able to attempt more combinations - purely in the interest of statistics. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pardon me being off topic, but I just can't resist answering a newbie's questions.<br />
<br />
I visited Gumkak's (http://www.valendor.org/gumkak/jewelcraft.asp) and figured out what I needed to do to gain skill.<br />
<br />
That, and I read the guide (http://www.rpgexpert.com/index.php?art/id:1427) on RPGExpert, but, it appears that that guide is just Gumkak's list of Slow but Cheap, pasted into a html file with some extra comments.  The Fast but Expensive has gained me 7 skillups in a day today (only stopped when I ran out of cash) while the slow but cheap didn't get me a skillup in 2 days. :)<br />
<br />
Note, the comment about Jewelcrafting only costing 4K is complete and utter tripe.  I'm down 17K already and only at 207 skill.  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KanadWinterstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do you have max charisma, however you go about getting it on your avatar.<br />
<br />
Do you have a geerlok equipped while doing combines.<br />
<br />
The figure of 4k is generous I agree, but getting to 250 for me didn't cost much more than 8k. Be sure you're getting the best prices buying and selling to merchants and try equiping a geerlok for the increased success rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">High Cha to buy and sell at best prices is one thing you need.  Then, geerlok - make sure it's equipped.<br />
<br />
Combine trivials are directly proportional to gem cost, and going to next metal starts the gem progression anew.  My advice is take silver up to peridot, before switching to electrum - and then switch to gold when you get to electrum+opal.  Gold is good to take all way to ruby before switching to plat.<br />
<br />
A while ago, enchanted gold/plat jewelry sold for 4-5pp over cost to make.  They nerfed it since, so it is best to practice on non-enchanted now.  But a lot of guides out there are old and haven't been updated after the nerf - so they might give you unrealistic numbers.  But to give you any idea, back in those days I went from 196 to 250 in one day, and incurred a total loss of 100pp - I bought from vendor, enchanted (mass enchants, c5, FT8, MP4 item, horse), and sold combines back to vendor.  Getting to 196 was not terribly expensive either - it was done before geerloks, and cost me roughly 2k.  Honestly, I cannot imagine how ANYONE could possibly spend 17k to get to 207.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was a level 1 Gnome Enchanter.  Full int + 5 CHA at creation.  I did not have any gear really, just 2 O. Steins for CHA, no geerlok.  I went the &quot;Slow and cheap&quot; route and really REALLY stopped gaining skill when I hit mid-range Gold stuff.  One problem was that I did not sell back my gems if I had extras.  So I have several packs full of gems waiting for me to make Enchanted Silver Jewelry with to sell in Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm going &quot;Fast but Expensive&quot; I've gained skill much faster.   Granted, I also spent a few K on int gear, taking me to 175 and hit level 8, but still.<br />
<br />
Looking back, I should have spent the first 10K on int gear *then* worried about JC, but, I had fun doing it.</div></div><hr />

I would beg to differ with you on the tripe part, I just GM'd JC last night and spent only a couple K after selling back what I had made (except for the geode jewelry).<br />
<br />
I used the sticky post here and found it quite useful, are you selling back anythign you make? I can see how you would lose that much plat doing JC unless you failed every time or didn't sell the stuff back to at least recoup some of the cost.<br />
<br />
Every item I made except for the geode jewelry sold back to the vendor for more than it cost me to make it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went to 250 skill in JC a couple weeks ago. I use a trophy as part of my tradeskill suit: cha &gt; 150 and wis &gt; 295.  I spent about 30k getting from around 220 to 250 one weekend. It ran about 50k total getting from 180 to 250. After the change in pricing as mentioned by other folks above, unenchanted platinum items lose about 10pp on sell back to the vendors. Enchanted items supposedly lose more.<br />
<br />
All successes were sold back to the vendor. All failures were sacrificed to the evil RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I last heavily did JC (read:  right before the GoD-Fishnerf), I was making gold and early plat jewelry.  A piece of jewelry that costs 99 pp to make sells back for 90.  108s sell back for 95 or so.  It most certainly does not sell back for more than you use to get the materials.  Each success is 9 plat, each failure is 100+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate to burst your bubble, but this was changed a while back.  Enchanted combines sell for less than unenchanted ones, which still sell for less than the cost to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>goobiddygoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, that is correct.<br />
<br />
With a 21 chanter, I am doing combines with platinum right now.  Enchanting all the bars with a mule, and getting about 5p per combine back.<br />
<br />
If you don't enchant the bars, there will be a loss of plat on sell back, but once you hit platinum (and maybe some of the higher gold combines) there will not be a loss for successful combines.<br />
<br />
I am at 224 JC right now and will most likely finish with a total loss of 5 or 6k, considering failed combines. <br />
<br />
I am not using a geerlok, and cha is at 127.</div></div><hr />

210+ is surprisingly cheap but requires capital and time enchant every bar to get a small profit and you should break even by 250</div></div><hr />

Sorry mate go try it first. you do get a profit of about 5% per combine which RNG eats but allows you to break even if you stay close to the curve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must have really wasted a lot of money.  I did not enchant any metal until I got to platinum, and still only spent 8k to get from 21 to 250!  At no time did I have max INT.  I did keep my CHA high enough for best buy/sell prices though.  Also the run only took me two days!  Just all in where your luck falls I guess!</div></div><hr />

Hate to burst your bubble, but you are incorrect!  Enchanted jewlery does sell back for more!!!  I just GM'd JC last month and posted ont his board with all my results.   Raising JC Skill (My Notes) (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=16291)<br />
<br />
I can with 100 percent certainty tell you enchanted sells back for a profit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, it was changed from selling for a profit to not selling for a profit.  Then it was changed back.  As it stands now, you can make a tiny amount by selling to a merchant provided you enchant the metals first.   In the long-run, this small fraction evens out unless you have a very good run with the RNG or youhave the AAs to reduce failures. <br />
