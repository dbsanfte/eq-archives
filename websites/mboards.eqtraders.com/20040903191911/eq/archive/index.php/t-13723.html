<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeriux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can not begin to explain how frustrated I am at running around the Karana's gathering silk with 10 other 60+ plus characters.  At 31st level, I can not insta kill craig spiders like them, so generally when I get a visual on one ... half the zone is tracking towards it spamming their &quot;Insta_silkgathering_2000&quot; nuke.  Typically, my pet &amp; I work it to about 60% ... then BAM, dead spider.  I get the standard &quot;whoops, sorry&quot; as I watch the KSer loot it and get a complimentary SOW for silks I helped them get. (Thank you, I realize I wasn't fast enough you do not have to rub it in :steamed: )  Then they are off bee lining towards the next closest spawn.   After a few hours, I'm lucky to have a single stack of silks (Silks not swatches).  Frustrated, I head to the baz just to check out the price of silks ... 20pp each!!!! <br />
 <br />
It just made me think how nice it would be to have an instanced zone where you could walk in and farm silks as long as you wish.  Make 'em no drop so you could not just drop them onto a baz mule for profit.  Have X amount of people able to access this zone at the same time ... Prices of silks would become realistic again for those that want to buy their way through it and those that wish to invest the time to farm silks for personal advance could still have a chance to do it.  Wouldn't it be nice ... <br />
<br />
My two cents worth - I just think it sucks that farming silks from green mobs are regulated to who can move the quickest and kill the fastest.  /rant off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you meant to put this in primal scream.<br />
<br />
and well /agree sometimes ek isn't a good spot to get silks.  lots of suggestions for other places though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bearcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome to the world of farming :)<br />
<br />
I will say one thing though.  KSing by a player of any level is rude and doubly more so when it is one of a 60+, or relatively high, level.<br />
<br />
There is not much that you can do about it though as higher levels (including myself) will be farming silks, pelts, whatever at a much faster rate than someone of your level.  Another thing, are there truly 10+ people in EK farming silk when you are there, or was that exaggeration?  If its true, leave.  And leave fast!  EK can support 2 maybe 3 silk farmers at a time (less if someone is AE'ing them).  My suggestion would be that you go and find a place where you might also be able to gather silks (and possibly xp).  The drop rate won't be as good but you should still come out ahead because you would be able to kill more.  You could try the Gigantic wooly spiders in EF (level 24--set spawns).  Or drachnids outside the tunnel in FV (high 20's, low 30's--you might want to get a partner unless you are well twinked).  Sure they won't drop silk as well as in EK but you will be able to get xp and silk off of them, and drachnids aren't bad for pp either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Firiona Vie. Kill the drachnids and get coin as well. Keep the area between FV and the caves, and most lower levels will appreciate it. Very under farmed. Enough for 2 mages. I would recommend epic pet (or highest level earth pet, but keep it DSed, if you lack epic). Use hands of ixiblat, muzzle and girdle. <br />
<br />
Peak silk is maybe 4. Usually it is one or 2. But when they are dropping up to 4pp each, and there are no place holders, I see no reason to go to the karanas. If you are an evil race, there are occasionally FV faction guards that wander by. There is an iksar necro that sometimes wanders down to the big lizard statue by the waterfall. The creaky old geezer for the wurmslayer quest is usually killed by only 2 drachnids, or 2 goblins. He paths in from the east and is usually killed before he can reach the tunnel. If you see a goblin roam by, kill it for faction. <br />
<br />
The drachnids in DL are spread out but could also be useful for your farming efforts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zeriux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Drachnids it is.  I'll give it whirl tonight hopefully. I'm Iksar, but I dont leave home without FD mem'd. <br />
<br />
Epic pet?  31 Necro here ... Certainly not twinked, but I'm not embarrased by my gear either =) <br />
<br />
No exaggeration about the 10 people in the zone, usually never less than 6.  While I can't say what they are doing,  I can tell for you certain that I can wander around and not see a spider for a good long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">South Ro isn't bad either for silks, slower drop rate, but you can spawn enough spiders to keep you busy for a while, plus the occasional SG for cash/loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bamlador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am torn with the subject being one of those that has been desperate for silk in my Solstice Robe time. As a lower level I would move to Upper Guk spiders where folks would actually respect a camp to farm my silk.<br />
<br />
I have tried to leave those who are gaining experience alone when I farm trade skill components but I am sure my tunnel vision has ticked someone off.<br />
<br />
Good Luck. Tailoring components is a competitive environment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks to everyone for turning this into a constructive thread. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's too bad about your experience in EK. I agree, 10 is way too many...but 3-5 can actually effectively support a couple lower level farmers IF they are killing everything that moves. Trackers killing only spiders will greatly diminish the number of spider spawns, but if everyone is killing everything, then it benefits everyone...<br />
<br />
I agree with the move to FV, tho I'd be careful, even in your low 30's as those spideys can be mean. However, on the plus side, farming something you need WHILE getting xp is super cool. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm guilty of silk farming with a 65 ranger. Those fatal bow shots just tickle me, but once I see more than 5 people in EK I hightail it out to FV.</div></div><hr />

I have been on both sides of the story, and at least on Stromm, EK isn't usually populated.  But when I see someone, even anon, I send a tell.  Often it is a person in the zone seeking exp AND silk.  Maybe it's just me, or maybe my pretty purple and pink robe, but I somehow make arrangements with the person.  When I have needed silks, I pay for them, they get xp and cash. <br />
<br />
Now.... this doesn't work on all servers.  At times it doesn't work on Stromm.  But when I farm, I go anon and check to see who is in the zone.  If there is a person who can get exp, I ask and 90% of the time, I either leave or come to a compromise.  Surprisingly it's worked more often then not, BUT it does require the higher level player to agree.<br />
<br />
My best one - FM faction farming - low level  30 something needed a quest piece from a named.  He /ooc'd - I told him I just needed faction. He asked me to kill and give him the stuff - which was NO DROP and for a specific quest.  That could have turned nasty but he quickly figured out teamwork was the game<br />
<br />
Personally when I have been on the younger side, I've sent tells to /anon players in the zone (CC, Velks, other farming areas) and told them what I'm doing - at least 80% of the time, I've gotten positive response, 10% no response (afk as they just sit there) and 5% jerks.<br />
<br />
This is an MMORPG so INTERACT with your fellow player, and if they are a jerk, come here to /ooc rantrave section and voice it.<br />
<br />
I've helped make a younger player some good money, and saving them time (I came to them to get the silk thus avoiding the bazaar).  Granted in this case you want to keep the silk, but try to strike a deal - you never know what may happen. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GUILTY of doing just this by mistake.  i have killed someone else's spider (pet runs faster than i do, didnt realize others had zoned into the zone...).<br />
<br />
however, i apologize profusely and leave the corpse for them to loot when it opens up.  and then try to stay away from where they are exping.  or go somewhere else.<br />
<br />
mistakes happen, am sorry you got ks'd by one of us careless high levels.  i wish you the best of luck in furthering both your tailoring and exping career. :hug:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hehe.  i want to get to 49 and train zone for a supernova.  only need to do it once but killing a zone has such an uber feel.  :)  <br />
<br />
i hunted here for hq cat pelts and silks.  fortunately a 65 druid in guild was foraging tea leaves.  needed something to do besides hit forage.  i made lots of quivers.  haven't needed to farm massive amounts of silk yet.  i like to hunt the drachnids in dl for xp when i can though.  low hp and can drop silk.  very slowly have built a decent reserve for wu's.  solstice robes will mock my efforts though.  :D  my guild helps a lot with tradeskills though.  if i'm farming greyhoppers for padding i hand off the greyhopper hide to another now that i've past it and things like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I seem to remember the spiders in upper guk being nice for silk drops, but has been a couple years since I've killed any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zeriux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thank you for the advice.   <br />
<br />
I'm really not looking for sympathy though.  I would use a high level spider slayer if I had one, it's simply more efficient.   At the time I was a bit steamed with the whole thing.  I guess I still am, but I have gotten a little distance from the problem and I can work with it now. :) <br />
<br />
I have tried FV - not exactly able to farm anything there.  Critters are tough and adds are brutal there.   I am thinking about Guk and the heartsting spiders ... will try there and see if things are more steady.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I appreciate the advice.  I'll keep trying spots until I find my spot.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>greenwood_d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">KK time to add to the fire - Im on Nameless and play from Down Under ( Australia if yah cant figure that out) - so  i get an nice opportunity to hunt while the US sleeps.  I found that EK has been diserted on many occassions.<br />
<br />
Here is my rant...<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi, Moderator Heartsong here.  If you with to 'rant', I suggest the Primal Scream forum, but please do not mention specific names (no personal attacks allowed).  Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Piikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've been on both sides of the fence. I started tradeskilling 2 years ago, when I was just a cleric in my late 20's.<br />
 <br />
EK was a royal pain to get to, then tough to farm without a group. <br />
<br />
Later, when I was in my 50's and skilling up tailoring and smithing, I would take groups of lower-level guildmates and pull for them, buffing and healing while they fought.<br />
<br />
Now, I just go at off-peak times and round up a whole lot of everything and AoE nuke, smile, loot - rinse &amp; repeat. My biggest AoE single kill was 47 MOB's about a month ago. I have to admit, what I do is run around at Run-3 speed, mashing the F-8 button over and over again until I see a new MOB targeted (target rings are great). I'll then chase that MOB until I hit it once, then look for the next target for myself. I don't care what it is, cyclops, wolf, spider, snake, etc, I'll agro and train it until I have at least a dozen MOB's. Then I'll hit Catastrophy and fill up my sacks.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry it's so hard at your level, but it was even harder for me when I was also your level. Now that it's become trivial, I spend 1 hour there where I used to spend 9 hrs there for the same number of silks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Seedling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you want silks, try Toxxulia, especially around the spires... you can't set 2 feet without spotting a spider, and being newbie zone, they instantly repop as well. Be prepared to kill that annoying poacher though... he got excited after walking through my train of mobs and attacked them, so I just pbae'd him together with the 20 spiders and spiderlings... (-Poachers, + Protectors of Jaggedpine, something like that)<br />
<br />
And noone but noobs come to Toxx, so you can often find loads of silks on the nearest vendors in Toxx, Erudin and Paineel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">shoosh.  don't give it away.  i go to erudin for ts containers like brew barrels hehe.<br />
<br />
yeah i pbae in tox when newbies are around.  gather from the other side of the forest and train them.  then kill the train and let them loot everything they want as long as they give me the silks.  i'm not taking their targets and they get free loot.  give them my uber 8 ds wizard buff too and they are normally more than happy to do it.  <br />
<br />
the island in erudin's crossing has spiders.  they drop silk.  sometimes they get stuck in volcano and have to pbae them out but not bad farming.  very rare seahorse roe bonus as well.</div></div><hr />
