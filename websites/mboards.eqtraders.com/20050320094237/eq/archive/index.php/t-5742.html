<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinuuyanea Nocturne</div><div class="date">04-05-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont really know where else to say this, so I will say it here.<br />
<br />
Some time ago, I used to live in Washington State.  I had moved there in hopes of participating in a specialty college, DigiPen, and achieving my dream of game design.  Long story short, some very bad things occured there and, for my safety, I had to return home on January 1st, 2001.  I thought to return for maybe a week, find a job as good as I had out there, and move to an apartment for the freedom that I longed for.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that was not to be the case.  The economic situation became terrible shortly after I returned, and I have spent the past 2.5 years bouncing between jobs.  <br />
<br />
However, this is not this particular problem.<br />
<br />
The problem is the person my mother is living with; a 40-year old drunkard, who is actually far worse off than I am.  He is violent, childish, and feels that he shouldnt have to answer to anyone about anything.  He has had several episodes of rage and violent anger; tonight, however, it was personal.<br />
<br />
He burst into the house tonight, and began slamming doors.  I confronted him and asked why he was doing such a thing; he got in my face and asked me why it was any of my business, and if I wanted to start something.  I fear no one, especially someone as drunk as he was acting and smelling.  He didnt like that.  My mother, hearing the commotion, came downstairs between us.  It was then that he struck me in the jaw several times and slapped my glasses from my face.  I simply stood there and smiled at his attempt to weaken me; he hit me again before he was taken from the room and forced to leave the house.<br />
<br />
This person is dangerous, however.<br />
<br />
He may return, armed, or hell bent on fighting me and getting me to stoop to his level and fight him.  If it comes to that, he may try and kill me, or I will be forced to kill him.  If you do not hear from me again, one or the other happened.<br />
<br />
Should I not return, I thank you for taking your time to read this, for viewing and enjoying my tradeskill guides.  And, most of  all, thank you for having me as a part of your community.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niami DenMother</div><div class="date">04-06-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most definitely, this requires a call to the police (charges of assault can be pressed if need be, to get them to take action). There are also domestic abuse centers in many locales. Regardless of whether your mother is willing to take action, you need to take action for your OWN sake, before it turns as dire as you fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tebyen Trueheart</div><div class="date">04-06-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definately press charges and have him arrested. I grew up around people like that, and it'll only get worse if he isn't stopped now. It wouldn't suprise me if he has had charges pressed against him before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">04-07-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I offer my prayers and thoughts for your safety. Consider going beyond pressing charges and get a restraining order. Also look into your state laws and see if you can get him committed. He needs help but should get that help far away from you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aoladari Raveynfyre</div><div class="date">04-07-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also note if you are living at home and get the Rest. Order he can't go near your mom either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phabos</div><div class="date">04-07-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about civil commitment, but it is possible, like someone suggested, to get a restraining against him for both of your sakes. Also, if you have the resources and an attorney, you may want to consider civil action (lawsuit) against him for assault and battery. While it may not be much, sometimes the threat or action of a lawsuit will deter an individual from repeating an action. <br />
<br />
I also recommend a call to the local prosecutor's office to get this guy arrested.<br />
<br />
Good luck Sinu. Take care, and you are in my prayers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-07-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some similar advice from (near) personal experience. As said already; GET THE POLICE INVOLVED! Even if nothing happens THIS time there will be a record and that may make the difference latter. PRESS CHARGES! AND get a restraining order. NOW, here's a key thing. MANY times, if you do NOT press charges, the judge will DROP the restraining order if it is contested. The thinking is that if it's not bad enough to press charges then it's not ad enough to warrant the restraining order. There does not have to be a conviction but the fact that you where serious enough to press charges is the kicker. Again, it’s important that the police know about it. There are a lot of things that they can not do but might want to if there is no pattern or back history AND should it ever come down to you having to defend your innocence in a court it’ll be MUCH better for you if he has a violent history on record.<br />
<br />
Now for the tough part. (Note, I know nothing about your mother or you specifically so I'm only going off why happens MOST of the time; you see enough of these situations and you start to see some very clear patterns.) Decide what is more important to you: your short term relationship with your mother or her safety. HOPEFULL I'm off the mark here but if this man is living with you mother there is a REALLY good chance that she'll want to give him &quot;another chance&quot; and then another and another... If she does, she'll NOT be pleased with you that you are going through with pressing charges and getting a restraining order. I've seen this time and again. In a situation like that, there are two roles played; the victimizer who provides punishment and abuse and the victim who ENABLES the victimizer. Note; I am NOT saying that the guy has ANY right to do what he is. What I AM saying is that MOST of the time the victim plays an equally active role in the results. If she IS playing the role of the victim then she'll fight against your efforts to stop it and may VERY WELL turn on you. It is COMMON. Again, HOPEFULLY I'm wrong. I HOPE she's surprised by his behavior and as appalled by it as you (and we) are.</div></div><hr />
