<br />
What they cost is completely dependant on which item you're looking at. Most common and most easily priced are the Geerlocks, which are about 100pp each ( a little more or less, depending on which one you're looking at ). There's one for each tradeskill and they modify by 5% ( except for Tinkering which is 2% ).<br />
<br />
Followups for this question should probably be in the General area, BTW... you'll get more responses there :)</div></div><hr />
