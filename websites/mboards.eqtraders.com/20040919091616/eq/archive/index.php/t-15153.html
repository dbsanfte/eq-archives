<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mrchaos101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok,<br />
<br />
I made 250. I know it aint a big deal but still.<br />
<br />
I feel jipped. I stopped fletching at 199. Im a ranger. I was gonna make fletching my main trade. I was talked into doing brewing instead because of how hard it would be to get stuff to make bows at lvl 33. I was told at lvl 51 I could do 3aa points and finish fletching then.<br />
<br />
SO I got to my last 2 points and found that a stack of yarrow is 546p !! yikes.<br />
<br />
AND I made Kaladim Const.  It is selling for only 15pp.   The stuiped corking device cost me more then 1k.  It will take me years to make my money back.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was looking for something else to make that could be sold.  I thougth of making  val temper but after reading threads it seems it can be NPC bought andther  is no point.  WITH almost every thing being NPC bought why bother doing the trade skills?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OK now that I got that off my chest, I would like to make my trophy, can any body point me to a url with recipe for it?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

If you do mean baking just go to main site and use the search box at the end of the menu bar.  It's nifty :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are talking about brewing, and KCs, I hope you realize that the yield is high on fermented yarrow and you don't need that many.  Also, there are a few brews that will easily recoup your costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mrchaos101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah I seen that I was getting 4 back.<br />
<br />
Is there another NON power drink that i can make.<br />
<br />
I want to make something that is used  in other trade skills. SOmething that sells good.  Like celestial Essens does for the poison makers.<br />
<br />
Is there any thing like that for brewers?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Not really.  There are a lot of different tempers, but they sell in fits and starts, and many of the smiths who want them just raise their own brewing anyway.<br />
<br />
I sell CEs, Grobb's, Qeynos Tea, Picnics, and Hero Sandwiches.  I rarely sell anything else from baking or brewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you bought the corker to make stuff, when youre done making stuff, you can always sell it for what you boought it for.<br />
<br />
Or, you can just buy a 200p diamond, go forage (or buy) sylvan oak, get the rest of the storebought items and find a 250 tinkerer.<br />
<br />
Brewing is the easiest and cheapest tradeskill to GM. You really think the trophy is gonna be a free ride as well? HA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 15pp, you're still making ~12pp per kaladim constitutional.   People buy KCs by the stack, so after the 5th stack, you'd have paid for you corking device.  <br />
<br />
Making pp with brewing isn't about huge profits all at once, but making a consistant profit over a long time.  KC, and qeynos afternoon tea sell very well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sorry. anyone who gets into tradeskills thinking to get rich quick is just fooling themselves. you will make money far faster going out and killing mosters for pp or for gear and selling it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fermented yarrow has a yield of 6.<br />
<br />
I make Kaladim in lots of 200 combines.  This costs me less than 1300pp. I get a success rate of about 50% and the yield is 4, so I usually net around 400 kaladims which I sell for 15pp each.  Thats 6k.  Net profit is 4700pp.<br />
<br />
What the heck are you complaining about? It doesn't get much better than this for steady tradeskilling sales.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, can't say it any better than that!<br />
<br />
Costs me less than 650 pp to set up a run of 100 combines. My success rate is a bit higher than 50% which means profit on a 100 run is 2350pp...<br />
<br />
ONE 100 attempt run of KC's pays for the corker, AND the whole cost of skilling up to 250 brewing... After that, it's pure profit.<br />
<br />
What the heck are you whining about? It don't get much better than that for steady sales.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And youll make even MORE money than that vendor diving for tradeskill stuff. (safer too)</div></div><hr />

Sigh, I wish this were true.  No more Merchant Mining.  A few patchs ago they made it so merchants only sell what you see.<br />
<br />
You can get a custom UI that displays all of the merchants slots.  But after those, there is nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That doesn't stop people from selling stupid things to merchants for stupid low prices.<br />
<br />
I got a words of sapience off a merchant yesterday for 8pp... turned it into a Word of Redemption and sold it for 10k.<br />
<br />
Guildmate of mine found ornate leather sleeve pattern on a merchant before.<br />
<br />
Best time to merchant surf is late at night the day of a patch, or the morning after a patch.  When people have sold lots of stuff but no one has surfed them to buy things yet.  After a few days they start to fill up with junk but you can still occasionally find a bargain.</div></div><hr />

[B]Guildmate of mine found ornate leather sleeve pattern on a merchant before.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I'm sure I tried to sell my ornate pattern before, and it said that I will get absolutely nothing for it.  I do not think it's possible to sell an ornate pattern/mold to a vendor, but then again, I could be wrong.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Many people have reported finding ornate patterns/molds on vendors.  Best part of finding them... they only cost 1cp.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hit the Primal Scream room for posts on vendor-diving finds. <br />
<br />
Yes, i know vendor MINING is dead, but i can still make thousands of plat in a few minutes just buying what other people throw away, anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mrchaos101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well just to fill you in.<br />
<br />
It seems there is a LOT of people selling the KA on my server.<br />
<br />
I watched it all day. And I always matched my price to the lowest or the persone closest to me i.e<br />
<br />
15pp seller means I sell mine for 15pp.  if he leaves and then the next one up is a 20pp seller, I rais my price up to 20pp unitil the 15pp seller comes back.<br />
<br />
I sold about 10 stacks this morning befor work doing this.  THe Demi sec seems to be the hard one to sell and seems cost the most to make.<br />
<br />
I dont know much about demi.  Who uses it?  How many do they buy at a time when the need it? Stacks?<br />
<br />
I have about 67 demi now and 2 others each have about 400-500 demi.  I matched price but will I loose out over not having enough made?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Demi-Sec Champagne is part of the PoTC quest.  People that need them only need 1 per ear, so they will be slow, steady sales.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mrchaos101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ty,<br />
<br />
and may I ask about the Q.Afternoon Tea? <br />
<br />
Any body know off the top of their head the cost in making these, say if the girffon feather and Tea laves are hunted and foraged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mrchaos101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Let me answer my own post<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g191&amp;menustr=070030000000<br />
<br />
LOL just as I posted it I foundthat on this site  sorry about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does that sell as good or better then the KalaD ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mrchaos101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I alsohad another question plz...<br />
<br />
<br />
Found a water drink that takes a long time to drink, it called fuzzy something 5000<br />
<br />
<br />
What skill makes these?  I cannot find them on the board any where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>vwdiesel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Fuzzlecutter Formula 5000 as far as I know is not a tradeskill-made item. It is only available from Ping Fuzzlecutter, the gnome merchant who is in some tents out in the newbie area in West Freeport(near the E Commons zone). Please correct me if I am wrong, though.</div></div><hr />
