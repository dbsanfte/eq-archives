<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kandrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">193 to 194 took me 300+ combines. 200 to 250 took 3k+ altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just went from 142 to 248 skill in mino hero's brew...<br />
<br />
and these were just the successes (http://www.personal.psu.edu/~gps129/eqstuff/minobrew.jpg) <br />
<br />
Add in the failures and it's a lot of clicking. :p<br />
<br />
edit: Ok, turns out the failures weren't as bad as I thought.  Going from 142 to 224, with an int just above 200 and no geerlok equipped, I had 1136 successes and 852 fails. It took around 700 combines (don't have the data for those) to get from 224 to 248.<br />
<br />
So figure 700 + 1136 + 852 = 2700ish combines from 142-248, at 18 clicks apiece, with random misclicks added in... probably around 50,000 mouseclicks.<br />
<br />
...wow. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zoyvod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One nite couple months ago i decided i had to have my trophy so i went to shadowhaven cuz i knew all the components for mino hero brew can be bought there. Started at 200 skill with 255 wis, took me 8 hours of nonstop combines to hit 248 at a cost of only like 30p (I sold everything  I made to vendor). There were some looooong stretches with zero skillups. Funny thing is got my last 2 points making kaladim constituionals in under 2 stacks of combines.</div></div><hr />
