<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's not a huge failure for some, but I'm up to attempt #6 for the Robe on this blasted quest.<br />
<br />
The first 4 saps I was able to obtain for free, but the remaining 11 have cost me between 15-25k a piece.  (And for a cleric who had to borrow 33k to finish getting her tradeskills at 220+ to do this quest - i.e. I'm broke, that's a TON of money.)<br />
<br />
Got to love when the RNG hits like that, so every minute I'm not raiding (cause we're SOO incredibly short on clerics, if I'm online I need to be there), I'm squeezing in time farming spiders (solo'ing the light blues when I can't get a tank/slower for the dark blues) or I'm in Sol Ro hoping like heck to get Ornate armor to sell hehe.<br />
<br />
Skill is currently at 246 with geerlok.<br />
<br />
/em tells that sir Grimel, &quot;cough up the goods NOW or else face my wrath&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OUCH! I feel your pain. While it wasn't on the robes I did blow over 150k in materials on stonehide tunics last week... FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL DANG IT!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tailoring is killing me as well.  I just did almost 30 stacks of Sacred Tunare Silks and only got 5 improves out of them.  :steamed: <br />
<br />
I'm holding out until 230 raw skill before trying the robe though.<br />
<br />
Luck to you;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For what it is worth... I failed 6 times as well but made it on my 7th! I was buying them also. I look at them for sale in the bazaar now and I still want to gouge out their hearts with a spork. <br />
<br />
But I'm not bitter. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>crystilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WOO HOO.<br />
<br />
6th attempt at the robe was the charm!<br />
<br />
1 try at bow, already had the platters made and my hopestone, so I'm now the proud owner of the Signet of the Arcane.<br />
<br />
/calms herself and begins farming for the plat for the Regen Marked Signet earring.<br />

/dances some more</div></div><hr />
