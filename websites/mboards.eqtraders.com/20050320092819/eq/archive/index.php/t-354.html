I live in a dorm and sometimes don't put the shade up before going outside.  One day after an EQ session this happened, and as soon as I stepped outside I saw it was pouring the rain.  My first thought was, &quot;Wake of Karana!&quot;  Then I had a reality check and was sadly disappointed *sigh*  hehehehe</div></div><hr />

There's a part where a woman is walking down a golf course hill to meet a man, who unfortunately (and unbeknownst to her) had discovered a very vicious little creature in a nearby water trap.  He starts to run in her direction, they see each other, and then she sees the monster.<br />

Yesterday, my mom and my aunt (who's visiting us from far away) asked if I could drive them out to a mall.  My mom wanted to visit a really nice cafe there; they have these dancing fountains that are really fun to watch.  She said, &quot;We can just sit by the fountain for a bit, have a cup of coffee, and relax.&quot;<br />

Honest to God, my first thought was, &quot;Cool, I can practice fishing while medding.&quot;<br />

Sorry, if you aren't from the US or if you don't watch a lot of television you might not have got that reference. Old Navy &quot;Evil Trendy Clothing Store&quot; did a series of commercials that resembled the old &quot;Family Fued&quot; game show. They were selling pullover jackets that have a zipper that only goes halfway up, thence a half-zipped pullover.<br />

Thats good, and reminded me a few months ago, when I was in my low 20's (21ish?) I was derailing a train by the Orc Scoutsman, I was fighting 4 legos, 3 slavers (or more?), Warden, Scout, and I don't know how many centurions.<br />

Yes, I died.  When I came back, I saw my corpse in a sea of orc corpses...<br />

Dots, as in peridots. used by clerics for symbols and stuff</div></div><hr />

Peridots, I imagine.  Dot is a common (if confusing) slang term for them.  It's not five stacks of Damage over Time.  :)</div></div><hr />

Oddly enough, I thought the same thing about the pronunciation.  Hence, I verbally call them &quot;doughs&quot;.  Though I like your interpretation, too -- &quot;Doh!  That was stupid.  Need a rez.  Need a dot!&quot;  :D</div></div><hr />

That coupled with the rarity of 'dots' and the absurd lengths needed to go to to acquire them shows that your post was entirely made up.<br />

forgot to read this thread for a while. Anyhow, dots are indeed slang for peridots. and the other dots are the candy ones on paper. They are pretty horrible. Wal-mart apparently carries them though since my wife found them there.</div></div><hr />

Camp, nuke, and loot have found their way into common vocabulary, as have most &quot;action&quot; words.  They just apply so nicely to RL, where other words fit but not so cleanly.<br />
<br />
The peridot abbrevation dot confused me for a long time ... kept wondering why the cleric was talking about Damage over Time ;)  Eventually caught on though ... I've heard them referred to as peri's a handful of times, but at least on Tunare that's a rare abbreviation.  I call them &quot;peridohs&quot; as well, but still call the abbreviation &quot;dots&quot; ... doesn't make much sense, but oh well.<br />
<br />
The primary way EQ has invaded my consciousness is Gate.  My main is a melee, but I have a number of caster alts.  When I'm sleepy and thinking about a trip or on a trip, and dreading the length, I've actually thought 'At least I'll only have to go one way, I can gate back' (occasionally altered to 'Do I have gate (on this char)?  Then I can just gate back which would make this so much better').  Really sucks when I wake up enough to realize I can't gate, or when I try to actually remember HOW to gate and remember this is life, not EQ.</div></div><hr />
