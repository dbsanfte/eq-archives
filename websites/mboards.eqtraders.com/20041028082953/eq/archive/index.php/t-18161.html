The trivial on the least effective method of enhancing these Augs, which only brings them up to the level of normal LDoN drops mind you, has a trivial value of 296!!!<br />
<br />
To rub a stone with a buffing sheet can't be that hard.  And they still haven't given JCM to everyone like they should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Simply rubbing a stone with a sheet might not seem hard... but to do it properly... an in a RPG does mean that things will MANY times fail to be logical from a real world perspective.</div></div><hr />

JCM is a class AA so I'd say class defining, if you were on the other side of the fence you wouldn't feel everyone should have it  :p</div></div><hr />

Yes, I would.  But that discussion is already being carried out on several other threads and boards.</div></div><hr />

Didn't Niami mention this was coming in her OOW preview? I swear I read it in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it did.  They just did not move jewelcraft from enchanter only.  it is still enchanter only.  the smithing, tailoring, fletching, brewing, baking, and pottery AA's that do the same are available to all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So why isnt fletching a (ranger) class only skill?<br />

And wheres the tinkering mastery for gnomes?<br />
<br />
Badly thought out if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to agree.  They should make JCM AAs available to the whole populace.  I mean, now enchanters can JCM ALL tradeskills available to them, and everyone else.<br />
<br />
Oh well, guess we can't whine too much about it, after all, they did give us something.</div></div><hr />

I suspect that they actually intended to do it this way, mimicing JCM more directly, but decided not to because some pairings just don't work and/or aren't very equitable.  <br />
<br />
I could see giving monks baking, and maybe clerics brewing (though really that should be race based, all dwarves get Brewing Mastery!), who gets pottery or smithing?  Once you leave the race based tradeskills the only 'obvious' ones are rangers/fletching and enchanters/jewelcraft.  They just seem reasonable from a roleplaying point of view.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Salvage &gt; Tradeskill Mastery... at least in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NerissaGoldenrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If they were going to divide them out so each class could get only one, they'd almost HAVE to make it match the Vah Shir citizenship quests, or there'd be a LOT of angry kitties running around.  Pushing folks into specific trades based on class, and then denying them the ultimate mastry of that trade due to their class would be a pretty nasty move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">296 trivial means that a person with max skill (252) will succeed in polishing 80 percent of the time, even without any JCM or Salvage.<br />
<br />
I doubt they'd want to make it any easier.</div></div><hr />
