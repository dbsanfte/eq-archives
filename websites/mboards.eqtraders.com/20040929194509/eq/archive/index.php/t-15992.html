<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beggly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't do potion making, my shaman is not high enough level yet, but my brother does, with a L65 shaman.  Recently he noted the fact that many of his potions have shown up with REQUIRED levels, some way in excess of the usefulness of the potion.  Or cutting into the usefulness of such potions for those levels that would want to use them regularly, for instance, SoW potions are going at L25.  Resist Magic potions, already not very useful (in my opinion) has a REQUIRED level of 50.  What is with this sudden change?  Anyone have any idea?<br />
<br />
I never noticed the info that such would be done in the patch information write-ups.  What did I miss?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know, but I've noticed that on all LOY poisons (which work like potions, they add a DD proc), and many other high end poisons (recommended level of 35, 45, 50, 55 etc..)<br />
<br />
So, I could make a poison that I couldn't use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beggly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've since learned that this may be a bug which will be taken care of on the next patch.  That would be nice.</div></div><hr />
