<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search for the new potions, Heat awarenss and such, but I either don't see or can't find the information as to what these potions do. Could someone point me in the right direction or explain it to me? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eveel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?searchtext=awareness</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niami DenMother</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just put up some info on it on the LoY alchemy recipes page:<br />
<br />
These potions have a 3-hour duration, and offer a 5% mana reduction on spells of the proper type and level. These focus effects stack with the focus effects on items. Awareness I affects spells of level 20 and below; awareness II affects spells of level 44 and below; awareness III affects spells of level 60 and below and awareness IV affects spells of level 65 and below<br />
<br />
So, heat awareness I would give a 5% mana reduction on fire-based spells of level 20 or below, benefit awareness I would give a 5% mana reduction on beneficial spells (buffs, heals), etc., etc.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

   I'm a druid and I LOVE the thought of these potions.  Can you tell me how much it costs to make and what's a reasonable price to pay for them?  For some reason my server's Shamen's aren't big into Alchemy, so I'll probably have to get the components and take them to my local shaman.<br />
<br />
I assume it's possible to have more than one effect/buff on you at once? <br />
<br />
I'm talking about focus IV effects btw.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Delendra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cost about 165pp for components.  They are not trivial at a 200 skill.  I am not sure on failure rate as I did not do a bunch of combines.  <br />
<br />
Remember it takes a lot of plat to raise alchemy as the sell back of potions to vendors is stinky.  That might be why there are not a lot of shaman doing alchemy.  Until this patch there was not a lot of upper end potions in demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Catath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just as an FYI: the term &quot;based&quot; means that you gain the benefits based on what the spell is resisted against.  <br />
<br />
For example: poison awareness III will give the 5% reduction for Gale of Poison (poison aoe rain spell), Bane of Nife (poison DoT) and Shock of Poison (poison DD).  <br />
<br />
This is a very important distinction that has caused some confusion.  A fellow shaman was confused as to why the Disease awareness wasn't working on his slow spell.  The slow spell is removed by cure disease, but it is still resisted based on Magic so it is reduced by Magic Awareness instead of Disease Awareness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Right it's resist based for Heat, cold, disease. poison and magic, but for beneficial awareness, it applies to all non-attack spells.<br />
<br />
Interesting point, unresistable spells don't get any bonus from these potions (Malo for example).</div></div><hr />
