<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been waiting for the boats to take me there for to long. <br />
<br />
Am I overlooking something ? <br />
<br />
Is there another way to get there ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drubear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The shuttle (not really a boat IMO) moves quick and only appears to stop at the left hand (facing the water) dock. <br />
<br />
However, as other boats appear to get borked it's conceivable that the one on your server did. <br />
<br />
The shuttle from Nedaria drops you on a dock at the Abysmal Sea boats where you switch to the Abysmal-&gt;Natimbi shuttle so another strat (if you think the boat is working at the other end) is to take the wayfarer's to Natimbi and try to grab the boat on the other side. <br />
<br />
I've never done that so others will have to help out with specifics but I'd heard that it's like the TD shuttle Oasis-&gt;Ogre Isle, where you have to swim out to board.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malathos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you do take the wayfarer's port to Natimbie - be very careful !<br />
There's a host of mobs that seem to wander around the WF camp in Natimbi that are scowling and very dark blue to a lvl 50.  There's also other beasties in the water that will follow you onto the land if you jump of the ship. By the time I got from the water to the magus, one of them had taken over 1k hp of me :shocked:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Getting to Abyssmal ?<br />
<br />
I just got GoD installed. Is there a city when the boat stops and can I take my 24 Druid there to look around? In other words is it safe for lower levels to go there and shop for ts items?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>oerin trubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is safe if you stay on the boat. Grab it on the end of the left peir.<br />
When you zone the boat stops for a couple minutes before it proceeds to the ship.<br />
If you take the boat to Natimbi it is not &quot;safe&quot;.<br />
The boat stops in the middle of a canal. Not sure other than lev of how to get on. Used to be if you missed the boat or fell off at butcherblock you could swim under and somehow come up thru the hull. Not sure if this would work here. The BB ship had a below deck area. This one does not and the deck is a good ways above the waterline.<br />
To get off at Natimbi you have to jump and hope you don't get eaten before you get ashore.<br />
I zoned from the Abysmal Sea to Natimbi once and got booted to desktop. When i logged back on i was in the middle of the ocean. I was certain i would be dead before i could swim to shore but got lucky.</div></div><hr />

wayfarer's magus to Nedaria's landing, head to end of the left dock as you face the water, take boat to abyssmal sea, board the big ship thing (first stop after you zone) and wander around.  Try not to strangle the bard in the baking/brewing room (whatshisname Visigothe).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">THANK YOU Kiz.<br />
<br />
i cannot use the ingame maps (no clue why, please dont try to help lol just irritates me now).  are no printed maps as yet that i have found.<br />
<br />
was feeling left out cause i missed the boat (rofl at myself).<br />
<br />
oh well, i slaughtered many otters anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So lets see if I got this right. I take the boat a la BB style and it zones into the Abysmal Sea and takes me to the large ship which has the vendors and quest npc's on it. I get onto the ship. If I stay on the boat does it continue on and zone to where all those nasties are or is it the ship that zones? I gather that there would be no casting on the ship so I can gate out. <br />
<br />
Nan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oerin trubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no casting on the transit boat.<br />
Casting is pernitted on the ship.<br />
The ship does not go anywhere. It's anchored there and staying put.<br />
There is a soulbinder on the ship, so casters can gate there (or gate out if bound elsewhere)<br />
I'm not sure if there is one or two boats. Every time i've boarded from the ship i've zoned to Natimbi. Newer stayed on to see where the next stop was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Btw you cannot zone in Abysmal by yourself, I tried some days ago with levi and horse to find any zone point, but seems to be that the boat teleport himself to the next zone upon reaching the middle of the ocean (I was also crashing a lot while running on the water). <br />
Notice that if you are near the boat when it stop in the ocean before zoning, you are also taken away (seems to be an AE tp like Nexus).<br />
<br />
Same case for Absymal to Nedaria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jayle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is there a way to get on the shuttle from the Natimbi wayfarer camp without levi? It seems there's no dock to easily board the shuttle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I timed the wait between shuttles at 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
I think the whole set-up is pretty strange. The GoD lore talks about the Queen of Thorns spending weeks navigating treacherous seas, having to use the Grozmak stone as a compass to find it's way to the new continent and having to be the size of a city to survive the passage... yet a little dingy can zip you from the mainland out to the Queen and then over to Natimbi no problem!</div></div><hr />

I was chuckling over this earlier today.<br />
<br />
&quot;The seas were horrible, we lost hundreds, and we were adrift for weeks... Oh look, the third boat this hour in in!!&quot;<br />

Not tested it yet, but you can try to stay on the way in front of the boat, hoping that the &quot;model bug&quot; will catch you and drop you directely on the boat (the boat will begin his travel, going through you, and sometimes you wil get &quot;punted&quot; to the top of it). Of course if the boat system is the same as our usual big boat :)</div></div><hr />

Tried it, this boat is a particularly solid model...  it just pushes you under the water :(  though only tried once, perhaps I missed the spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well, it took them so long cause they weren't looking for yet another lost continent.. they were looking for the second lost moon, rumored to have an impossible orbit that would make it sop the sun never seemed to move in relationship to... wait.. they found that one (/throws out the basic laws of physics)... <br />
<br />
.. but there is a rumor that some athropods (normally know for their exo-skeletons) have interior skeletons (which would mean,.,. they're not actually insects or arachnids... /thows out the biology books too..)....<br />
<br />
FINE!  admit it..  they hired me as the navigator on the original boat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, so the only solution would be to swim and stay near the boat when it is going to be ported. You need to swim carefully because there are some nasty &quot;fish&quot; around. The only good thing about them is that they stop attacking you when you are in the boat or on the shore.</div></div><hr />
