<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ddubois</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on tradeskills for awhile now, in anticipation of doing the Aid Grimel quest.  I hadn't actually read thru the quest till today, I merely had a vague knowledge that you needed 220 (at minimum) in all tradeskills and needed to famr alot of POP stuff.  I was quite surprised to see the JC portion of the quest involves going to Velious and doing some coldain quests.  The dwarves really hate me - is this going to be as much of a pain in the ass as I think it will be?  What, if anything, is tradable?<br />
<br />
FYI, I am an enchanter, is charming the quests mobs possible?  I doubt Collaboration will help in any signifigant way - like I said, the dwarves really hate me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">um.  why? how?  normal factions to trade are kael and cov factions.  how did you kill dorf faction?  also no almost nothing is tradeable or mqable that i know of.  mostly 1 peice hand ins that you have made and worked with already i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how did you kill dorf faction? <br />
<br />
By killing Dorfs and/or their King.  :)<br />
<br />
Collecting the Hammer won't be bad, since it is Droppable.  Look around in the Bazaar, a Vendor might have one for sale.<br />
<br />
And you can read this thread about obtaining the Etching Tool...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">call me old fashioned but this quest is all about helping the coldain.  shouldn't you be at least non-kos to do it.  imagine being kos to all the dorfs and they still love you.  urg.  <br />
<br />
i know you just want the hammer but the link was trying to do the shawl quest while kos and upset about factioning.  ITS THE COLDAIN PRAYER SHAWL.  coldain.  how do you miss that.  :confused:</div></div><hr />

Aid Grimel quest <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Liwsa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is stupid that a PoP expansion quest uses something optained from a 3 previous expansion.  Also with Velious people changed factions a lot.  It is not right to punish folks that did something 3 expansions ago.</div></div><hr />
