Oh and the guy above me..i've heard stories of people failing 10 times at 250, and ive heard stories of people succeeding first time at 220.<br />
<br />
Read a few primal scream threads, you'll get the idea.<br />
<br />
There's no security in doinf 4 at once...you can still fail all 4 times...its your decision</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What Leafrat said. Statisically, you should have a better chance to succeed at 250 than 220. So, with that in mind, consider the skill up more vs. farm for more question that became the general consensus for those with the Coldain shawls tailoring dilemma. Should I get my skill up higher to try the tailoring combine or should I just combine away because it's easier to farm the quest components and keep trying than to farm and try to skill up. Most folks decided it was easier to farm for the quest components than to skill up.<br />
<br />
However, in the case of the fire tunic, the quest components (those bloody saps) are rare as heck, so you may decide differently.<br />
<br />
Again, this is based on the statistical fact that you should have a better chance of success at 250 than 220.  But, throw in RNG and the fact that are many reported cases of people succeeding at 220 and failing 250 (I myself failed 3 times at 250) that you could just say what the heck.</div></div><hr />

Almost fainted when I saw the robe on my cursor. :p<br />
<br />
I wanted to get to at least 230 before I tried, but I got those last 3 skillups before I had three saps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was of the mind that farming curing agents was easier and more productive then farming ornate for $ for tailoring components.

Farming for cash to get skill ups to get a higher tailoring skill seems a heckuva lot easier to me. But, it's up to you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I would feel safe guessing the trivial is 335.  <br />
<br />
As to the farm vs. try now argument…  Let's assume that the base level for success at max skill (252) is 50%.  Looking at the formulas derived to estimate probability of success, the probability drops by 1% per point of modified skill until it gets to 5%.  <br />
<br />
In this case, someone with an unmodified skill of 220 would have a modified skill of 231 with a geerlok.  This is 21 points lower than max skill, so you would expect the base probability of success to be about 29% (50 – 21).  You would figure on average that four attempts worth should get it done for you.  <br />
<br />
However, the probability of failing all four times at 220 is still 25.4%.  So having four sets of components is no guarantee.  You have to do 7 attempts before you have less than a 10% chance of failing them all.  It can look pretty bleak sometimes.<br />
<br />
Let's look at this from the point of view of someone buying most/all their components in the bazaar.  On E'ci, you might spend 100pp per skillup attempt if you are at all careful in buying your supplies.  If you average a skillup in 20 attempts, you are looking at ~2k per skillup.  Getting to 240 unmodified gets you to max modified skill.  So for another 44k you can give yourself a 21% better chance per attempt to make your item.  In this case, the 4 combines gives you over a 93% chance to have at least one be successful.  Compare that to the cost of 6 – 9 extra saps and those skillups start to look pretty cheap.<br />

<br />
With my Geerlok equipped, I made my first attempt at 221 and failed. I made another attempt at 228 and failed it too. I tried again at 231 and failed it as well. After failing 3 times, I decided to max my effective skill (240 unmodified but with my Geerlok equipped) before trying again. As it turned out, I caompletely ran dry of every last bit of my Tailoring combines with my skill at 239. Rather than make the investment in more, I decided to try it again, and I succeeded.   :D  <br />
<br />
And not only did I finally succeed, I also got that last skillup to 240 too.  :) <br />
<br />
The rest of the quest was easy for me compared to this part. I had read all about the nightmares that people had gone through with this step in the quest (including that poor soul who failed his first 19 tries) and sure enough, it held true to me as well. I was soooo happy it was finally over when I did it!<br />
<br />
That lasted about 12 hours when I started on my second one.  :p  It took me about 3 hours to redo the first 4 steps and I'm right back to farming saps again.  :grumpy:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I box a SHM and SK and I was in Fire this morning for approximately 90-95 mins.  I got 5 saps to drop.  I pulled spiders about 80% of the pulls, and killed fairly slow (SK + SHM not the best DPS).  <br />
<br />
Now I have a total of 7 saps, so I am going to try the combine at 220 +5%  (need 15 more skillups to hit 220  =/)<br />
<br />
I'm sure I will fail, but honestly since I've boxed 10 saps total (gave the first three to a friend, who failed) in less than 20-30 hrs in fire, I am willing to try the combine and pray that all the good deeds I've ever done will be shined upon.<br />

<br />
I have spent several sessions farming them and have seen varying results. I have gone as long as 4 hours without a single sap and have also seen 3 drop within 50 mins, all proving that the RNG can either be your best friend or your worst enemy.<br />

<br />
Personally, I agree with previous posters that it's easier to farm saps for more attempts than it is to increase your skill.<br />
<br />
The approximate cost to go from 220 to 250 using solstice robes is 120k.  For 120k, you could buy enough saps for 2 more attempts (following your theoretical first attempt at 220), which theoretically would yield at least one success.  In the meantime, you could be getting exp or farming saps instead of doing 740 solstice robe combines.  Just at a guess, I'd say that 740 solstice robe combines would take you something like 14 hours of played time, and in 14 hours I bet you could get at least 1-2 saps for free via farming.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I failed two final combines, on this, failed the brewing subcombine that ate 3 obsidianwood saps, then failed a third final combine.  Which means, since I bought my saps in the bazaar, I just dropped almost 100Kpp and have nothing to show for it.  That was a significant portion of my bankroll, and now I cannot try to garment again until I can get another source for the saps.<br />

This is, of course, with a skill of 250.  People who succeed this combine on their first attempt in their 220s and 230s need to come to unspeakably grisly ends.<br />

I was 1 for 1 on the tunic @ 250 Raw.  In fact, I succeded the 1 attempt on the Bow (although I did fail the stupid precombine of the string once). And have now completed my first earring.  I have began #2 and have caught up to my friend, who is still stuck on the tunic.<br />
<br />
She is 0/3 on the tunic combine, and has failed the sap combine once.  <br />
We are both incredibly broke as we have purchased all but 2 of the saps for our combined 5 shots at 2 tunics.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't know if I will have it in me to try #2 after watching what she has went through on her first one.<br />

/sigh<br />
back to farming.</div></div><hr />

Make that 0/6 on tunic, excluding the 1 failed sap combine.  21 saps and counting.</div></div><hr />
