<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aanena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the last 4 days I have been working on my pottery skill trying to get it from 193 to 196. Because of the number of failures I've spent almost 6k. I am lucky if I get one skill up a day. I've tried a couple of different recipies but doesn't seem to work. My wis is maxed at 275 with kei and my int with kei is 147. Is my wis too low or is something else going. Ive gone a couple days with no skill ups and also gone about 200 combines with no skill ups. Is something wrong? I sure could use some help on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Collwyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope....since they made pottery harder and you are right in the beginning of the pottery &quot;hell levels&quot;, that sounds about right.  One thing you may want to consider is finding a way to increase your wisdom even more.  Remember, the higher your wisdom, the higher chance for a skillup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aanena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Problem with that is that my wisdom won't go any higher. Its maxed at 275 with kei. I've tried to get it higher and won't go so its maxed I figure.</div></div><hr />

There are no &quot;hell levels&quot;, but 180+ is where it will start to slow down and depending on the RNG, you might go 100+ combines without a skill gain at any point after that.  You might hate the RNG now, but you'll love it when it gives you 3 skill gains in a row or 5 on a stack (yes, that happens too).  Just stick with it, and try to space out your combine sessions so that you don't get too frustrated from no movement during a single session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Utope Eljugador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont think hell level is meant to mean the classic &quot;this point/level takes X amount more of combines/xp to finish&quot; i think its simply a reference to the streaky rng that creates unusually large runs without skill ups (i.e. 100+, 200+ etc), of which there absolutely are hellish points we've all had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aanena - what level and class are you?  <br />
<br />
I believe you are still in the range to make casserole dishes for skill ups and they certainly shouldn't add up to 6K.  I skilled pottery to 200 before ceramic linings stacked, and skipped over the casseroles and went straight to Opal Encrusted Stiens, and I still don't think I spent even close to 6k ... ouchie!<br />

Thanks Utope, that's exactly what I meant.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a cleric so I can't check for sure (and EQ is down again anyway), but at level 64 you should be able to use AA to boost your wisdom higher than 275.  As a level 62 Druid, I have my wis at 295 (max for my level); at 63 I will be able to get 315, 64 to 335, and at 65 max it out at 355.  I would be surprised if a Cleric didn't have those same AA choices available to them.<br />
<br />
And to find information about the GM trophy, you should see it listed on the Recipes - Pottery link on the main eqtraders site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Auricula, you are right. Clerics do follow the same increase as you describe. Currently at 65, I am only at 335 wisdom because I haven't had time to get more AAs to increase the last bit of wisdom. I will be working on that for next few weeks. I should be able to get to 355 soon.<br />
