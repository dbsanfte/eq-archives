It really only added percentages and changed the inventory window.  Now, I cannot find a basic one at all (even old ones really)-they are all very ornate, which I do not really like.  anyone have a prettty simple they would like to share?  Or care to enlighten me on how to make my very own :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lonewylfe</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to make your own, you're going to have to either learn xml enough to write it or just enough to slice what you want out of other interfaces.<br />
Most inventories haven't been updated with the new charm slot (though there are easy fixes out there for that)<br />
I know eqgui.com has some simple player windows...you'll have to view a lot to find them though.<br />
I'm still slicing and whacking at my target window to get it to look just right...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winterwind MorningLight</div><div class="date">03-15-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a really simple ui that is very close to the last link posted.  I'm not extremely knowledgable about xml but I have been able to do enough to update mine with each patch.  I keep emails for everyone who uses my ui and try to fix any updates asap as soon as I'm able.  This usually is within a day of the patch, hopefully just hours after servers are up if I'm able.  <br />
<br />
Below is an older picture of my ui.  This pictures a group window I made for my cleric friend.  Currently I use a group window that only  has the F2-F6 (percents and invite/disband keys removed/moved).   <br />
<br />
My ui is updated now to include percents for Exp and AA Exp gauges, the charm inventory slot, all the new dye/face etc keys, the new Selector Menu icons for that window.  The inventory seems a little bit more cramped with all the new additions.  I need to find some time to play around with it some.  It's simple and small and easy to use at 800x600.<br />
<br />
If you would like my ui email me at SusieCF@aol.com and I'll send it to you.   Just put in the subject something about ui.  <br />
