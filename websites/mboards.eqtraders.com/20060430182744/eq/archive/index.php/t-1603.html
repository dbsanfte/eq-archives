<br />
Acrylia plate is a little slower, but you can probably make 50-100kpp selling the finished armor, if you farm your own windstones and acrylia, along with trader purchasing in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
The advantage to acrylia is it gives you the cash to start into mistletoe sickles at about 220 skill.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you want to continue making the same armor past 220, shadowscream gives you more combines in less farming time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zopharr</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on how fast you want to reach 250 (or 240 or whatever), versus how much income you want from smithing in the meantime before you can make the high-end cultural.<br />
<br />
If you want to GM smithing as quickly as possible, and don't care about making money with it along the way, go the Shadwoscream route. You'll get points for a skillup or three every session if you get the knack of farming the Hollowshade war.<br />
<br />
If you don't really care about how long it takes you to GM smithing - and want to make some cash along the way - then go the acrylia route. Getting components is much slower (assuming that windstones at decent prices aren't comon in your bazaar), so it will take you *much* longer to GM smithing - but you can sell the proceeds for a decent chunk of change. Not great, but with the cultural market pretty well sated I do acrylia plate (with bought components) to pay for my C3 fix, and it seems to be going OK.<br />
<br />
Looking at your level, though, you're going to be farming greens.  I'd say do a day farming shadowscream components, and one farming windstones, see which gets you the most combines - and then factor in the time doing acrylia compared with more time for raiding/exping if you go the shadowscream route. Which is best for you really depends on how you value time vs. (some) plat vs. exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rassy fleetfoot</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as i've said before..farm a ton of shadowscream stuff, and some acrylia stuff when you can..even if you do 1 acrylia plate combine a week, or every few days or whatever, you might just make something to sell for a little cash, and maybe an imp, and the shadowscream which is basically free (except time and cost of mold and rings) for imps cos the armor is barely twink quality. <br />
<br />
so..work both..but mostly shadowscream cos its a whole lot easier..expecially if you have a guild to helpo farm.</div></div><hr />

All in all rassy fleetfoot summed it up pretty much.</div></div><hr />
