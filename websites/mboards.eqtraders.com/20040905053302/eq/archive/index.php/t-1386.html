<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EnfinitiStarr8</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, you can GM Alchemy and one other skill before using AAs. But just remember, your &quot;Young&quot; Sham must be level 64 before being 200 in Alchemy. And it is not a cheap skill....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stina 1701A</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a young troll shaman who I plan to GM Alchemy with, and I was wondering as Alchemy is a class based tradeskill and I can GM in one other ordinary tradeskill, which ones would you feel is more useful to a shaman with Alchemy?<br />
<br />
Oh and why aint there a faq in this section? Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gundark Viresdator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that pottery items, with some stats and the spiritstones and soulstones go along well with the gate potions.  It doesn't really &quot;compliment&quot; it, but it helps you to corner the market so to speak products that gate players out of dangerous situations.<br />

Just a thought, and probably half baked.  :)</div></div><hr />
