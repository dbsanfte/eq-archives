<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Manan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to train my research to 200 the other day, but when I hit 185 the GM just kept saying something similar to:<br />
&quot;How can I train you, when you know more than I?!&quot;<br />
<br />
My level was 56 (now 57) at the time, so I know I should have been able to train to 200.<br />
<br />
The wizard GM I was training with was the one in the first room of the Neriak caster's guild.  I'll try Gath N`Mare tonight, since he is Neriak's head wizard GM (the guy you have to take your note to as a newbie) in order to see if this makes a difference.<br />
<br />
The only other thing I could think of was that maybe I had my Automated Quill equipped and it was using my adjusted Research skill, but at 185 my adjusted skill should have only been 192.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else has encountered this before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hm... my husband's erudite enchanter was level 55 when we trained him to 200 research. Pretty sure we trained him in POK. So yes, try a different trainer? My high elf mage trained to 200 research but I'm not sure where... i can figure it out but pretty sure it was pre-POK, but maybe not! Only other thing I can think of is, did you have enough plat on you at the time? Although that message should have been different. and no, geerlok shouldn't affect it. how odd, and terribly annoying!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Manan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had over 800pp on me at the time, so money wasn't an issue.<br />
<br />
I'll try PoK tonight as well if the others don't work.<br />

<br />
There are different levels that trainers can train too.  The ones in home cities.. the actually guildmaster (the one the notes for), can train to max... his &quot;assistants&quot; (all the other ones basically), can't.<br />
<br />
I've heard that the pok ones can train to max.. but that's second hand... i know that some can, we've had both a necro train to 200, and a mage to 193.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Manan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was able to confirm this tonight.<br />
<br />
Shanez X`Teria in the first room of the Neriak Casters guild was only able to train me up to 185.  Gath N`Mare, on the other hand, was able to train me to 200.<br />

<br />
Perhaps this information should be added to the FAQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very strange. Glad you got it figured out =) Now I'm wondering who I trained with LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I trained to 200 in PoK, forget the name of the guy though.<br />
<br />
Added thsi info to the FAQ, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ndaara.. either train in pok, or train in your starting city, and use the trainer you gave your note too.  Either of these will train you to 200.  You could also train in any city that supports your class, but you'd have to know which is the head guildmaster there for you (again, the one that that city turns it's beginning notes into).</div></div><hr />
