<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got to 241 and made my trophy a couple weeks ago and finally bit the bullet and took it to 250 today.  Yay! (would have happened years ago except I did pottery first and it still isn't maxed out.)<br />
<br />
Thanks to folks that helped and EQTraders for all the knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">any info would be great.....<br />
<br />
Skill up route?<br />
<br />
Combines per point?<br />
<br />
A guess at cost?<br />
<br />
Anything that would help a person on their way to GMing Baking would make this a usefull post, and not just another 'hey i got 250'<br />
<br />
(dont take this personaly, i am just a beliver that these posts should include some info to help other tradeskillers)<br />
<br />
On another hand, GRATS, a job well done!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Pootle - I'll parse my logs as soon as I get a chance and summarize from 202-250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OMG, your a Moderator....  I just kinda flamed a Moderator...<br />
<br />
/Hide<br />
<br />
/em waits for things to blow over!<br />
<br />
Sorry Froni, its just a personal crusade of mine to try to get people to add info that others can use in these type of threads.<br />
<br />
On another note i am approaching 250 myself (236) with a whole load of Hero Parts waiting for me at home on a mule.  <br />
<br />
/em's hands begin to shake....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL - it is OK, Pootle - you are absolutely right in the crusade for more info and I will post it in this once I get the logs parsed (tried to bring them to work but my CDROM drive was flakey - need to replace it after a horrible batch of dusty kitty litter wiped out a bunch of drives.)<br />
<br />
BTW,  I am only an itty bitty moderator of the Vazaelle Marketplace, no need to fear a thing at all LOL.  I think everyone with that tag on their name has a good sense of humor anyhow.  Besides that, I have always appreciated your posts here and in the druid forums so I would never be able to get mad at you.  :)<br />
<br />
Skill path is in another thread but I didn't move beyond 202 until after the new UI.  Did almost exclusively beer-battered hynid and cragbeast to 222.  After that maybe a couple stacks of souffles, some tuna rice surprises, and the balance was MTP's.   As soon as I can parse my logs I'll put together costs and skillup statistics.<br />
<br />
Oh one thing with the MTP combines that made things easier on me (besides doing them in Rivervale) was doing subcombines on the fly to save space and decrease the number of bank swaps needed to mule stuff around.  The only thing I made ahead of time in my last pass was jum jum spiced ale because making it on the fly didn't save all that much space and premade the intermediate combines of woven mandrake and steel boning.  I had made too many jum jum cakes when I started the MTP path as well so they were made ahead of time too.  Anyhow I would make a stack (or a little less) of whatever was needed for the final combine and just kept swapping between oven and mixing bowl - it really saved a lot of time compared to when I made all the subcombines ahead of time and was swapping them around between banks.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to be too scared of her(just a little) since the Vazaelle forum here is full of cobwebs from disuse.  Some people post in the Bazaar board on VCC (server board), but I have not really found a vocal tradeskill haven for Vazaelle.  I guess most of us just post on the general boards rather than the server specific ones.</div></div><hr />

I Play on Vazaelle and currently working on Baking as well.<br />
<br />
I am currently at 195 and working on MTP.  The time consuming part for me is working on all the other tradeskills needed for MTP.<br />
<br />
Smithing, Tailoring and Pottery.<br />
<br />
Once again, Congratz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WTG Froni :) <br />
<br />
Still plugging away and at 212 baking now. I WILL be there someday.<br />
<br />
Gratz again Froni :D</div></div><hr />

OK, my log didn't capture everything and don't really know why.  If I went by the log I went from 202 to 222 in about 100 tries - not correct so this is kind of rough.<br />
<br />
I bought about 38 stacks of cup of sugar for beer-battered hynid and cragbeast steaks and made one stack of MTP's to go to 222:<br />
<br />
roughly 580 combines at a cost of about 500pp <br />
====<br />
For 222 to 250:<br />
another 40 combines of beer-battered hynid/cragbeast souffles added ~25pp<br />
<br />
MTP's took 63 fennel to do the rest to 250.  So that would be a little less than 630 MTP combines to get to 250.<br />
From the calculator that Rewde made, the cost was around 470 pp.<br />
<br />
Because of the log issues I can't extract my success rate but all that works out to an average of about  26 combines/skillup with a total cost of of about 1000pp.   <br />
<br />
I think this is an overestimate - I gave batter and beer-battered meat away while I was doing this.  I am guessing I was a bit closer to an average of 24 combines/skillup.   This was mostly at 265 wisdom except for the final run to 250 at 270 wisdom.  I tried to have KEI everytime I was skilling even though my wis was capped anyhow.<br />
<br />
Took me two tries to make trophy at skill 241 with geerlok.  <br />
<br />
Sorry I don't have better details - I really don't know why the log didn't capture everything (except lots of NPC's were talking in places.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">:angel: Gratz Froni!:angel: <br />
Now I know who to bum MTP off of ;) <br />
Personally, I've been using the new GoD recipies for my skillups. I might move to Halas Pies (after I find my mammoth meat, darn mules) <br />
Grats again!<br />
/em Toasts Froni!<br />
:cheers:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorvari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">MTPs are much better than GoD combines post 222, since the few foraged goodies you need have a much higher yield in terms of combines that can give skillups.  1 Vegetable is good for 6? MTPs, but only 1 Souffle.<br />
<br />
If you are swimming in Vegetables, then disregard.<br />
<br />
I have several stacks of leftover Fruit if anyone needs them for the MTP marmalade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well i finally got 250 over the easter weekend.<br />
<br />
Did GOD to 222<br />
<br />
400 MTP attemps got me to 232 (10 skillup)<br />
<br />
A Lot of Soufle got me to 246<br />
<br />
Another 400 MTP and i was 246 (10 skillup)<br />
<br />
22 Vann Toe Stew to 249 (3 skill in 22 combines !!!!!)<br />
<br />
about 35 Jord Pies tipped me the magic number 250</div></div><hr />
