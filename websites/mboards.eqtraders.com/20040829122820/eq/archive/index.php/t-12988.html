<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mr.X</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why isn't there a recipe for, say, Lizard Meat sandwich?     Because nobody has tried one, because many have tried &amp; it doesn't work, or what?<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see tips on how to experiment.      This might be fun for a dumb Ogre baker who may never get to the highest levels.       I've read the site thoroughly (I think) and yet I see no info on recipes that have failed, especially obvious-sounding ones like {insert meat here} sandwich.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm an EQ noob who just got it for Xmas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">buy book sin home cities that may have clues, some quests give clues. Put items in the contian hit combine. Didnt work try again with other items ;) all trial and error.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are correct... there is not a database of recipies that were tried but didn't work.<br />
<br />
That would be insanely huge, given the sheer number of possible combinations.<br />
<br />
For example... some recipies that make sense, but are not in the game...<br />
<br />
Breaded Mushrooms: Bread Crumbs + Mushrooms + Vegetable Oil.<br />
Cheese Stuffed Poppers: Cheese (three different kinds available) + Habenero Peppers.<br />
Owlbear Fillets:  Owlbear Meat + Fillet Knife.<br />
Sonic Wolf Fillets:  Sonic Wolf Meat + Fillet Knife.<br />
<br />
The list goes on and on.<br />
<br />
While it's a nice idea, you also have to realize that there's only so much room in the item database.  Putting in more recipies for Baking, especially more pre-200 trivial recipies, takes away space that could be used for many other things.<br />
<br />
Like better Stat-Drinks.  :angel:</div></div><hr />
