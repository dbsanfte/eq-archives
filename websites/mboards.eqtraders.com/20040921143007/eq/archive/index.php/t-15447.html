Lev 24 Nec, Dark Elf, with skill of 24 in Research.<br />
<br />
First combine of this Trival  62 spell and get msg saying I can no longer advance my skills by making this item.<br />
Five hours of gathering components for the Training Rune, down the drain.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is any indication of what SOE has done to the trade skills, then there is no telling what the Triv's are on most all items.<br />
<br />
I am unable to &quot;open&quot; my Concordance of Research using the Control, &quot;right click&quot; to do a search for this combine.<br />
Not even sure the Concordance can be opened that way, since hardly any<br />
&quot;portable&quot; combine container can be opened the way it's advertised .... since the &quot;Patch&quot;<br />
----------<br />
My thanks to ALeksnadros for laerting me to the fact I needed to add a Quill and Parchment to the receipe to make the combines work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aleksandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Practice Research using the Azia and Beza runes can be one of the most frustrating things you're going to lear as an INT caster - unless you're a Mage, then it's doing chain-research to get some of your pet spells around level 39 :bookworm: <br />
<br />
Are you sure you were using the correct items for the proper difficulty practice rune?  Check http://eq.crgaming.com/research/ and follow the proper path, good or evil.  All the rune combinations are the same, just depends which vendor you want to go to for the Concordance.  Practice Runes range in difficulty from Apprentice to Magi for both Azia and Beza.  Higher difficulty the rune, more of a pain in the posterior collecting the components will be.  Magi Azia, for instance, requires Brownie Parts (baking blasphemy!), Shark Skin, and Topaz with the quill and parchment.  Magi Beza uses Topaz, Giant Toes (any kind), and Fine Steel piercing weapons.<br />
<br />
Carry Concordance, a couple stacks of Parchment and Quills, couple stacks of whatever vendor-bought items can be had for your current needs, and hunt like a madman.  4 or 5 summoned Grandmaster Satchels just aren't enough room anymore for all this stuff :faint:<br />
<br />
EDIT--&gt;  I misread your post.  The Training Rune does trivial at 62, but you have to combine the Azia and Beza Training Runes in your class-specific book to make a completed rune.  Actual trivials for the Azia and Beza runes are much lower than the Complete Rune the make when combined (for example, in a Lexicon or Elemental Grimoire).  Above info is still good as far as it goes though :wizard:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>2Toes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, there's where I am going wrong.  I am reading the Training Azia and Beza are triv at 62 and then the combine of the Azia and Beza to make the completed Training Rune is also triv at 62.<br />
Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vwdiesel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just to add a tad bit of info, but I *think* that combining the various components to make the Azia and Beza halves of the runes is a no-fail combine that can be done with research skill of zero. I say this based on the fact that, when making the particular rune that requires Burned-Out Lightstones, I gave my concordance to my ranger so it would be easier to hunt down wisps (hunted in West Commons, was fairly easy). The Burned-Out Lightstones are no-drop, so I just had my ranger do the combines for me and I am 99% certain that in 40 or so attempts (may have been 60, at least 40 though) he never failed one. Perhaps I was just lucky with the RNG, but I think this means that combining the various parts to make each half-rune is no-fail.<br />
<br />
Of course, I combined the Azia and Beza halves on my chanter to get the skill ups. Don't recall if I ever failed one. And yes, this can be really frustrating. I stopped with the practice runes at about skill 95 with my chanter, and moved to combining actual research pages.  At this point the components for making the practice runes were just too difficult to farm/buy, and often could be sold for more than the cost to buy the equivalent research pages from a vendor.<br />
<br />
Of the three possible skill-up methods (combining research pages, doing practice runes, and buying skill-ups from the trainer), I am interested to know which method is the most cost-effective over the 0-200 research skill spectrum. I'm still working on research myself (and gathering cost data in the process) and once I collate all that data I'll post my data in this section of the forum.</div></div><hr />
