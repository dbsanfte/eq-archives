<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MoggeTreestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think Rangers should get Fletching AAs similar to Enchanter JCAAs.<br />
<br />
Anyone agree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I feel they gave enchanters th emarket with JC. No other class can compete. Id like to see JCM either given to every class or give each class one tradeskill they can &quot;master&quot;. Of course the second option will start too many arguements (his skill is better than mine... his tailoring AA can make him more than my brewing WANNNHH). I think they should either <br />
1. Get rid fo the JCMAAs and give people refunds if they bought them<br />
OR<br />
2. Give everyone the ability to train in JCM<br />
<br />
just my 2 coppers ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They already considered that for rangers at the same time as jcm but it was taken away before release. I cant remember the aa number but there was an alt activate number that would say something like &quot;you do not have any training in Fletching Master&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Simco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fletching/Bowyer Mastery is number 83. To bad it you can´t activate it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm guessing they were trying to balance overall numbers of class level AA skills available during the first Luclin period, and overall utility.  <br />
<br />
For class AA, Enchanters get <br />
<br />
Mass Group Buff<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery<br />
Dire Charm <br />
Gather Mana <br />
Jewel Craft Mastery <br />
Permanent Illusion<br />
Quick Buff <br />
<br />
MGB and Gather Mana are really useful for chanters, but situational; DC is useful in specific zones (and was probably more powerful in Luclin than it has been since LDoN or GoD came out).   So, the devs gave them something that seemed at least moderately useful.<br />
<br />
Rangers, on the other hand, get: <br />
<br />
Ambidexterity<br />
Body and Mind Rejuvenation <br />
Physical Enhancement <br />
Double Riposte <br />
Mass Group Buff <br />
Innate Camouflage  <br />
Archery Mastery <br />
Endless Quiver <br />
<br />
Ok, MGB doesnt' strike me as a really useful ranger skill, but Innate Camo, Archery Mastery, and Endless Quiver are GREAT.  I doubt many rangers would choose to lose any of these or the melee based AA in favor of Fletching Mastery.<br />
<br />
But I'm willing to bet that a LOT of Enchanters would be willing to lose Jewel Craft mastery for something really useful for a skill useful to the &quot;kill mob X&quot; aspect of gameplay.<br />
<br />
That said, I DO think it would be neat if other classes got something like Jewelcraft mastery.  Perhaps a GoD style AA which allows anyone to gain a little more success chance at 1 chosen skill (and that anyone would, of course, include enchanters; the devs would have to decide if they could add to Jewelcraft or not).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will NEVER buy MGB. Its SUCH a worthless ranger skill. We only get *1* spell thats even worth MGBing and its not that much mana, and it doesnt take that long to buff a while raid. 12 casts would take me a little over a minute and maybe 1/3 of my mana pool.<br />
<br />
I would LOVE to swap MGB for Fletching Mastery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One of my guild rangers got mgb and i still don't understand why....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some people in my guild have it but they also have 500+AA. When it comes down to buying the useless skilsl MGB is prob the bet of the useless skills. ;) At least it CAN be used and does do something (altho its usefulness is minor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xodar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">~250 AA and no MGB, perhaps after innate charisma, lol.<br />
<br />
A fletching mastery has potential but I question whether they would want, at this stage of the game, to seriously reduce failures on the ele bows and grimel piece.  A non-specific AA (or a choose-your-skill AA like tanaan mastery) would be interesting.<br />
<br />
And when I do eventually buy MGB it will only be to cast SoT 3 seconds before the pallies MGB Brell's ;^)_</div></div><hr />
