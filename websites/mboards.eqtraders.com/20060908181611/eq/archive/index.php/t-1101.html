My &quot;farmer&quot; is a level 60 ranger if that helps.  I'm looking for what you all think would be the most efficient mob(s)/zone to target to maximize the number of spider silks.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to get a bit of xp while farming silk, then Sol B and kill LDC's. Silk drops won't be as fast tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can kill them quickly and get quite a bunch in a short amount of time at your level.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Piikaa</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I farmed 40-50 silks this morning as a 52 cleric.  Took me about 45 min, including a few afk's and medding time.<br />
<br />
I have J-boots for the speed.  Spells up are Strike, Smite, Retribution, Upheaval, Root.  Also have DA/DB &amp; Remedy.<br />
<br />
What I do is run around and smack everything at least once with either a fast spell like strike or my 1HB until I have 15-20 MOB's.  I'll hit everything, especially the Chasm Crawlers.  Once I have an adequate supply of lil-greenies, I face them, back up, then move into the center of the group and cast Upheaval until it goes off and kills everything.<br />
<br />
It helps to kill everything so that the spiders keep popping.  When ever I kill 4-10 CCrawlers, I'll start to see spiders popping all around me.<br />
<br />
I usually work from the entrance ramp to HPH over to the Halfling outpost to the Gorge &amp; the plains in between.  Yes, many of the spiders pop up on the hillside, but with other farmers out, they usually get them first.  I have found this area much better odds of the spider still being there by the time you get to him...  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
the mq can be used in making poison vials (for vials of ___ mana)<br />
<br />
the lq can be made into padding and used/sold for smithing purposes.<br />

The AE kills everything then I just Elixir the bard. I get all kinds of pelts, tons of silk, and rain water. I normaly do this a few times a month. <br />
