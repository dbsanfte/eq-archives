<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tshesebe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Everyone, tonight i was trying to raise my baking skill up to 200 by cooking beer-braised cragbeast &amp; hynid steaks. I have the various meats in convenient 1 lb chunks, and made beer braising sauce, but I'll be blimied if i can get the two to combine in a mixing bowl!  Does anyone know if this recipe has had a change of any kind that I should be aware of?  Thanks, and Welcome back from Fan Faire Niami and everyone else!</div></div><hr />

Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iumarex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So nice of them to reduce the amount of clicking that you need to do in tradeskilling, so that they can run up the number of useless combines that need to be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After you cut your fish/meat into neat lil 1lb chunks, of course it's logical that you should then put in back in the mixing bowl on its own to... er...<br />
... slap it around a bit? <br />
...give it a nice massage? <br />
...let it mature for a few, er, split seconds? <br />
....shape it into a nice regular EQ-chunk-of-meat-shape?<br />

Don't make me use my Meat Tenderizer on you...! :dedhorse:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Laurelleii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't mind the extra steps here, especially since we can fish/forage different size meats that yield multiple combines. Much less tedious than the one fish at a time like everwhere else.</div></div><hr />
