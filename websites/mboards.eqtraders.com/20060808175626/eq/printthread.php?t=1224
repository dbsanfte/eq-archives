Gets lots of rest, drink lots of hot tea with honey, breath in steam several times a day - you cough a bit more to start but it helps a ton - nd try hot orange juice for the painful throat.<br />

Yes, the physician has a great deal of blame for this as well. It's usually the person coming in complaining of being sick that wheedles the doctor into writing a script for antibiotics, though...<br />

Take them as per your doctor's orders (which are probably &quot;until the pills are gone&quot;). Just don't stop taking them once you feel better... that's precisely how drug-resistant strains develop.</div>

		<div>Piece of advice for any sick person;<br />
<br />
ALWAYS always always! know the medications your taking .. look them up on the net .. ask your doctor exactly what they do and are for &lt;they HAVE to tell you .. its the law and if it isnt where you live, its just plain ethical to tell the patient!&gt;.<br />
<br />
I learned without screwing myself up about pills, just by not wanting to take them. As a matter of fact my doctor of the day almost turned me into a breeding ground for exactly the situation that Cubwynn has describing.<br />
<br />
Doc had me taking 12 pills every morning and 10 every night for life. Turned out that 8 of them were vitamins &lt;prescriptions for Vitas?.. and the costs!&gt;, dumped those, 1 was a painkiller &amp;lt;shudder - chem addiction no thanks &gt; dumped, and 3 were broad spectrum anti-biotics. <br />
What I found that out, I realized that if I did get sick whilest on these things, I was most likely headed directly for the morgue. Do not pass go, do not stop.<br />
They were using the BIG boys &lt;at the time&gt; on me. And I wasnt sick!<br />
IE - Euar becomes a natural disaster waiting to happen. If I got sick, they would have no new anti's to treat it .. and a new version of a bacteria/illness would be unleashed &amp;lt;3 pills trashed!&gt;.<br />
That was irresponsible of the medical profession and ALL too common.<br />
Just as an FYI, I was in a collision and broke my back &lt;perm&gt;. I was NEVER sick, nor did I need anti-biotics.</div>

They had me on some pretty nasty painkillers for a while a few years back - painkillers with caffeine in them during the day, and a sedative-hypnotic at night.  {shudder}  Both of them, of course, highly addictive.  I stayed on them long enough to finish the documentation at my job (single point of failure in the compnay, with me gone, there were procedures that nobody at all would know how to handle), retire, and to function through physical pain until the day after my mom's funeral, then I got myself off the durn things fast.<br />
<br />
My doctor never really warned me how addictive the stuff I was on was, and never dug deeper than &quot;stress&quot; as a diagnosis.  (At least that's better than the elderly doctor who once told me I had the &quot;vapors&quot; when I went in with a very bad case of mononucleosis in college, but only minorly so.) I'd likely still be on them, years later, if that doctor had their way, or on something stronger ... without the proper diagnosis of the true medical problem that was at the root of it all.  However, I'd done some research on my own, and made a decision to cope with pain without the drugs BEFORE I got addicted to them.<br />
<br />
{shakes head}  Thankfully, the medical profession might have some duds (the malpractice suit against the doctor that misdiagnosed my mom's cancer as a &quot;yeast infection&quot; when the biopsy clearly showed cancer finally goes to trial this fall), but there are also some true gems out there as well, and I've been fortunate to find some of the latter since we moved to California.<br />

How ever I do know their are horrid doctors out there.  My boyfriends sister went to a doctor who is not her usual one.  She had been having major stomach pains and had gained quite a bit of weight recently even.  The doctor told her she was fat and to do sit ups.  They didn't agree with that and sched an apt with her regular doctor.  Who found out she had a ovarian cyst about the size of a watermelon.  And if she had done the sit ups like the first doctor recommended she could have burst it and died.<br />

Seems like half the nation is sick  :shock: <br />

		<div>Personally, I know how it is to have bad bad doctors. I'll give you a breif (ha) run down of my medical history.<br />
<br />
Around the time I was 3.. I was allergic to milk, had weird fevers, colds a lot, stomach pain, and LOTS of nosebleeds. This went on from about 3-to 10 (Well, still going on, but just that section). <br />
<br />
When I was 10, I finally got a doc to look at me seriously. Said I had ovarian cysts, and that was why my stomach hurt. She gave me birth control pills to take. I said suuure ok. (she said over and over againt hat EVERY woman has cysts. I was just whiny about it was all  :shock: )<br />
<br />
So, two years later. I wake up one morning, my arm is numb. I mean, totally numb, nof eeling, can't move it. I go to school, then have to have my grandma come check me out early in the day. We go to the hospital, the dr there says it's a pinched nerve, and reccomends me to a nerve doc and a rheumatologist, and some other things. They did blood work, just incse. I had a positive Ana and a &quot;high&quot; RF factor. Long story short (too late), after 3 years in a dr's care, she totally missed the fact that 1) I have lupus. 2) I have sjogrens syndrome. 3) I did NOT have ovarian cysts. It's been 6 years since I first went to that doctor, I'm on anti depressants( Celexia, Elavil) and I'm not taking my lupus meds anymore, cause I pretty much don't care anymore, and It wasn't helping. <br />
<br />
The thing is, I could proably be DEAD right now if I hadn't gone to the other doctors and had stayed with that one. She also didn't correctly treat my mother, who also has Auto-immune problems (but for some reason mom still goes to that doc.). I'm tryng to talk my mother into filing a malpractice suit.. but she won't. &amp;lt;sighs&gt; Just.. always get a second opnion. And ASK to see your chart!! If I had asked to see what my RF was when she FIRST did blood, it could've avoided all this. <br />
<br />
<br />
(Side note, if anyone cares to know, I'm still having all he symptoms I had years ago when i was very young, only now it's worse. My left arm doesn't always work, I have perma-fever, and not much they can do about it. My RF factor (last time they checked, which wasn't during a flare up), was 1600, iirc. A normal, non-lupus/arthritis person has around 100 at the most. )</div>

		<div>The whole loss of faith in the medical profession is part of why I went into hollistic healing.  <br />
<br />
As a CMP (Certified Massage Practicioner) working towards my CMT and HHP (Therapist and Hollistic Heal Prac, respectively), my plan is to work somewhere in New England in post-surgical and recovery care.  Part of what we learn in the classroom includes the reasons Malpractice Insurance exsists and some statistics about it.<br />
<br />
It's that lack of faith in the medical profession that inspires people to pressure the better-educated doctors to give them the wrong drug because they heard a friend with a sore throat was helped by antibiotics and think they have the same thing.  <br />
<br />
Of course, the government not cracking down on doctors who don't know what their doing and the constant, ineffectual changes in the way medical care is handled in the country certainly doesn't help either.<br />
<br />
In short, the medical field is as messed up as any other we just notice it more because our health is very important to us.  I personally think the ratio of bad doctors to good doctors is the same as the ratio of bad plumbers to good ones, or bad electricians, or bad telemarketers, or bad managers.<br />
<br />
Was there a point here?  Maybe.  Mostly I think it's don't hold a bad opinion of one person over the head of another.  Yes, there's bad eggs in the medical field.  Don't hate doctors, or patients, or insurance salesmen because the last one you dealt with shafted you.  No matter what the size of that shaft was, it doesn't effect the odds of the next person doing the same to you.<br />
<br />
I run into this all the time myself as a male massage practicioner.  The number of people who would come into the office I used to work in and immediately assume I can't do anything but deep tissue or whatnot.<br />
<br />
I do Jin-Shin Acutouch or Shiatsu as a prefrence, but because I'm a scrawny white guy folks assume I do sports massage or maybe swedish.<br />
<br />
It pays to shop around and talk to people. Always have a doctor you know and trust, use the same level of descrimination you would if you were selecting a mechanic for your car.  You should use the same level of descrimination for your lawyer, dentist, grocer, barber, plumber, electrician or any service industry.<br />
<br />
The bad eggs rely on people who don't shop around and don't care what their background is.  Be an intelligent, educated consumer and a lot of your problems go away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry I was so lengthy, but this is a fairly close-to-home issue for me too.</div>

		<div>Just thought I'd leave an update.  I still have a slight cough but that's all it is.  Just like an every day cough just more often than usual.  I am still taking my meds don't worry :)  I have about 5 days left.  I may have gotten my boyfriend sick whoops, but he's trying to ward it off with vitamin C.  so far he doesn't have it as bad as I did.  We are hoping he will get better faster than I did.</div>
