<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kuronekosama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">400pp each, and just about as many as you can give.  Also will trade 1 ring worth of armor per stack of royal temper.  I'll update this post if my need changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Allayne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe I have enough components to try at least 5 attempts at royal tempers. With 162 brewing plus geerlok I don't expect many failures (I hope).<br />
<br />
When I get back into town Sunday evening I can make the combines for you if you still are interested. Would also be willing to trade some of the tempers (or all depending on how many I can make) for a sickle for PotC (my Druid would LOVE an earing).<br />
<br />
Look for me as either Allayne, Lall, Lorsen or Ekaterin. If you see Eykir on you can ask him if I am around too.<br />
