<br />
I just wanted to stop by and leave a couple of thoughts about the last 250 skill points in fletching.<br />
<br />
(*I got to 250 with 2 skillups out of 14 last night.*)<br />
<br />
I am amazed in some ways as to the plat estimates that people have spent on fletching, and that Bows are considered a good route if you have the cash, and maybe 'Time is of the Essence'.<br />
<br />
I did not keep any solid record as to Exactly how much I spent - and how many skillups it took to get to each point, etc. As many have pointed out - it is random. I feel that I probably was about Average for most of my post 202 run.<br />
<br />
I beleive that I spent between 50 and 60K from 202- 250. however - and this is a big one - I Do remember spending about 32K doing bows over a couple of days. This netted me (as I recall) 6 skillups - and I refused to go back down that route - as I have a Lower end cashflow.<br />
<br />
What I did do - was buy Acrylia in the Bazaar. Possibly - I was lucky - not as many other people wanted it when I was looking - but I also recall several times - checking - and running over to Trader Smith - only to find that he no longer had what I wanted. So I know there Were others out there buying.<br />
<br />
I made a 'general' rule that I would not pay more than 50-55P per Block or lg/sm brick. I would pay up to 25P per piece - even though this looks more expensive (and it is) - it was worth it to me to save the storage space. Occasionally I would pay more - if say - I was trying to get 1-3 more combines to even off a stack of components - but 50-55 was my general cap.<br />
<br />
Another plus on my side is that I had been collecting and hoarding Condensed pieces since just after Luclin came out. I did not know what they were for - but I bought all I could find (still do actually...) and have been saving them. (Especially once I found out what they were for.) In all honesty - that is actually WHY I chose Fletching to take over 200 (for now I guess). So - I had amassed around 40 stacks of the condensed (mostly shadow - maybe 6 stacks of fire - and not even ONE full stack of ice!) which let me basically eliminate needing to farm them - and thus also halve my possible plat cost in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
As far as skillup data - I said I did not keep track religiously. However - my general impressions:<br />
<br />
202 - 210 - not too bad - slower for sure than pre-202 - but OK.<br />
210 - 217 - The bow combines - Very Expensive - and [probably the wrong choice for me.<br />
218 - 225 - Again - Average - about 1 skillup every stack to stack and a half.<br />
226 - 232 - Slow - about one skillup per 2 stacks. The Ugh points.<br />
233 - 242 - A bit better - maybe only a stack and a half per skillup.<br />
243 - 247 - Slower yet - about 2 - 2.5 stacks per skillup.<br />
248 - This one irks me. It was about 5 stacks before the combine......<br />
249 - 250 - NICE! Both skillups in 14 combines!<br />
<br />
I think it took me about 6-8 months after hitting 202 to get here - and I have had lots of fun the whole time! Many in my guild have been helpful with bringing me components - and very supportive! (*Thanks Guys - and Girls!*) This site here has helped me a lot also - and I know I have beneifited a lot from its being here!<br />
<br />
Anyway - Now I need to look into my Trophy - and then there is of course - still scouring all over for Elemental Bow components! I WILL one day make one - without Ever having been to the Elementals myself!<br />

&quot;The wife is Very happy that I have stopped bringing arrows home. Why - just recently - she threatened to bake me an arrow pie - as they were shoved into the oven - as I had nowhere else left to put them!&quot;</div></div><hr />
