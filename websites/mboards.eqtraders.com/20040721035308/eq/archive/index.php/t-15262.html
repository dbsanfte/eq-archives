<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarabella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive always been a masochist and a tradeskiller!<br />
<br />
AFter a year off from EQ I came back, managed to suffer through open raids, got Ele flagged and started working on Grimel. Got lucky with the tunic (1st combine) and the bow (1st combine) and viola.. earring.<br />
<br />
I felt kind of empty but crunched some aa's and ldons.<br />
<br />
The other night boredom set in.<br />
<br />
I thought to myself, well brewing is 248, might as well just top that off.. so I did.<br />
<br />
Well JC is sitting at 247, might as well top that off... so I did.<br />
<br />
I really should work up my pottery higher.....3 days later its 250.<br />
<br />
Hmm maybe I should work up smithing some more... after a week of flooding the market with sickles its now 250.<br />
<br />
<br />
So now 6/7 sitting at 250 and my tailoring is 235. I know I should just let it sit there, let the collapsable sewing kit whine at me, stop stop stop and walk away from tradeskilling BUT I CANT! Its looking at me! All I can think of is slaughtering wyvern and orcs and I dream of runes of ellipse and words of abrogation.. I must tailor!<br />
<br />
I remember laughing at my friend when she said she was going to 250 them all, telling her she was insane, that I was perfectly happy with mine where they were! And now, I hide in the corner from her, rubbing my gm needle for good luck whispering my precious to it over and over.<br />
<br />
Somebody help me put my needle down!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

I hear you. <br />
<br />
I do my tailoring in the Rivervale Cleric guild, my first home, &lt; why I dont know but I SWEAR I got more skill ups there than anywhere&gt; and many is the time I kick my kit across the pews, but then I heard the Snickering of Bristlebane and kept going .<br />
<br />
Keep your chin up and your needle poised!! Almost done!</div></div><hr />
