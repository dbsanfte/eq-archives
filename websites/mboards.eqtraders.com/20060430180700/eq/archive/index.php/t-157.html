<br />
I have spent countless hours in Tenebous in the mines trying to farm them.  On a daily basis of 12 hours of killing I get around 3-5 windstones(roughly 2 combines)<br />
<br />
I have tried the Van Nes(blue alien guys) in Scarlet Desert, none from them.<br />
<br />
Besides paying 200pp each, What is the secret to getting Windstones?</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to get windstones. You're best bet would be to constantly check Katta vendors for them. Perhaps you'll get lucky.<br />

But yea, no quick n easy way to egt windstones  :?</div></div><hr />

You just have to check the vendors and sometimes you'll get real lucky and someone will have sold 1 or 2.  Last week I bought 8   :shock:  (yea you read that right) off a vendor. I was so happy I almost dropped my Geerlok  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Vas Ren are &quot;water&quot; guys...  It's the Meeda Hune who are &quot;air&quot; guys and more often drop Essence of Wind &amp;amp; Windstones.</div></div><hr />

Hadn't tried the TS versions or UP.  Grimling caves give you ore and windstones though, so that's where I usually camp being I need the ore for smithing and tailoring.<br />
<br />
Grol Baku=Earth aliens<br />
Crai Ligi   =Air aliens<br />
Meeda Hune=Water aliens<br />
Vas Ren = Fire aliens<br />
<br />
Just my guess on those...<br />

Are the Grimlings in TM any easier than the Dire Sonic Wolves? I've only been in battle with a Grimling Geomancer there. Low on health after duoing a Dire Sonic Wolf with a bard, we sat down. Next thing I know WHAM! You have been hit for 187hp. I had just enough time to type ZONE and check that the bard was ahead of me before zoning myself. We both got through with about 20% hp. This kind of put me off going for the Grimlings for a while.<br />
<br />
Do they drop the stones/ore only around the caves, or will the wandering ones drop them also?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that makes the Geomancers hard is that they are casters with fairly high damage output... I farm acrylia there with my 31 warrior and 46 monk... the warrior can solo an orefinder, but needs a healer to even think about  going after a geomancer. Even the 46 monk has some trouble with the geomancers.<br />
<br />
Of course, the answer to this is to go after them with magic resists up as high as possible... I found that having some MR gear and resist magic up when farming makes the Geomancers pretty trivial, even for the 31 warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bemidian</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been farming the crud out of TM the last 2 weeks. I have found the Cral Ligi drop Windstones the most. Meeda Hune drop them too but not as much. It really does not matter though as I kill them all. :)<br />
<br />
I don't know about SD, but in TM the Cral Ligi are Air and Meeda Hune are water. If you look at them closely you will see the Cral Ligi are a light blue and Meeda Hune a Dark Blue.<br />
<br />
As to ore, the grol Baku drop a lot of ore. 99% of it is bricks. I have looted more large bricks than anything. Rarely a block. I would say 60% large, 40% small with a very rare block thrown in. It is not uncommon to loot more than one brick from them. Yesterday I killed 2 that dropped 3 bricks. That is of course 6 small pieces chiseled down if you need them.<br />
<br />
The key to TM farming of aliens is tracking though. The terrain is too rugged to see them easily.</div></div><hr />

Load up your best Nuke and your fastest Mezz-type spell (A long Stun, a short Mezz, Screaming Terror, whatever) and just alternate between the two.  With any caster powerful enough to be dangerous, the battle runs somthing like:<br />
<br />
You:  Nuke!<br />
Caster:  Begin Casting!<br />
You:  Mezz!<br />
Caster:  Uhh...<br />
You:  Nuke!<br />
Caster:  Begin Casting Again!<br />
You:  Mezz!<br />
Caster: D'Oh!<br />
You:  Nuke!<br />
Caster:  Begin Casting Thrice!<br />
You:  Mezz!<br />
Caster:  Drool!<br />
You:  Laugh!  Nuke!<br />
Caster:  Die!<br />
<br />
But's that's just my thought on the matter, your mileage may vary, not valid in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Qebec</div></div><hr />

Somedays they drop pretty fast, specially if you can afford to take out the stoopid fire elementals with their dagnabit damage shields to churn the spawn tables more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jnash</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too make it a point to check all the vendors in KattaC, GF, SH and Bazaar regularly.. occassionally find a Windstone for 12p.  Only reason I'm posting a reply is to urge all you smiths out there to refrain from paying the ridiculous prices being charged by players in the bazaar for windstones.  On Saryrn, peeps have them listed for 300p each.  That's ridiculous.  Yes, to some of you, 300p is nothing.  However, if NOBODY buys them for this price, they either have to drop their prices to sell them, or be stuck with them in inventory.  My cut - off price is 100p.  Comments?<br />

All acrylia, essence of wind, and windstones go into the bazaar for fairly reasonable prices.  Most of what I get is merchant mined, from Katta and Grimling Forest merchants.  I am happy to be helping other smiths and tailors, and making a decent profit at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I'm with you.. I keep collecting a lot of ore and stuff... then I get fed up... sell it all off... rinse, repeat. One of these days Im going to make a single piece of Acrylia armor, just to say I did...</div></div><hr />

I've had anywhere from a night of leveling there drop 1 to 5 windstones, with the normal being closer to 1.  This is using a 60 druid to PL and I pretty much keep the entire cave clear.<br />
<br />
As for pricing, on Torvo they seem to normally be around 200pp.  Last time I had a dozen I priced them at 190pp before going to sleep and they were gone by morning.</div></div><hr />
