WARNING: This is a rant. It's not politically correct. I have nothing against a nationality. I just find this particular trend &quot;outsourcing&quot; to be revolting and potentially disasterous for the economy.<br />
:steamed:<br />
WARNING: That means DO NOT read this if you don't want a political message.<br />
:steamed:<br />
<br />
I just heard from another website that two VERY interesting things are happening.<br />
<br />
1) Phone support has been moved to India.<br />
<br />
2) The Guide program will be discontinued, with people in India taking their place for /petition weeding. (Since for most of those living in India English is not their first language they will NOT be responding to petitions, only grading them and forwarding them to GMs for response.)<br />
<br />
I don't know that 2) is true, and if not ... all the better.<br />
<br />
But I decided to do a little math, since phone tech support used to be my job, and software development (a LOT of which is being shipped over to India these days) is the focus of me going back to school for my B.S. degree in Comp Sci.<br />
<br />
Supposedly there are 1000 guides currently who will be phased out. They are required to work 6, and usually average more like 10, hours per week.<br />
<br />
That's about 10,000 man-hours a week. (sorry, that's the gender neutral use of &quot;man&quot; please don't be offended, I've worked with lots of great women in phone support and the Guide Program both)<br />
<br />
If you figure that the Guides are replaced with people working 60 hours a week (and why not? no 40-hour work week in India) that comes out to 165 (roughly) Indian workers replacing 1000 guides.<br />
<br />
Now if we ASSUME that the guides, who currently only get free accounts, were to be &quot;getting out of paying&quot; 12.99 (13 for round numbers) a month... <br />
<br />
(NOTE: I was a Guide for a little over 3 months. I had renewed my account just before I became a Full Guide for six months. When I left the guide program, surprise surprise... less than 2 months later I had to renew again. My compensation for guiding... ZERO.)<br />
<br />
(NOTE: Most guides would have a CLUE and pay for longer terms than Month-to-Month, but we'll let that slide.)<br />
<br />
12 * 13 * 1000 = 156,000 dollars. That's a hunk of money.<br />
<br />
156,000 / 165 = 945 dollars per Indian guide replacement.<br />
<br />
Hmm... need to save some bucks... so let's pay them<br />
<br />
800 dollars a year per.<br />
<br />
The &quot;owners&quot; of the outsourcing company are going to take a cut. Let's be nice and presume it's only 10%<br />
<br />
720 dollars a year. Ouch. That's not a lot for working 60 hours a week.<br />
<br />
720 dollars a year translates to 32,562 rupees a year.  Go here to check (http://www.xe.com/ucc/) <br />
<br />
Now according to The US Department of State (http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3454.htm) the average per capita income for India is about 480 dollars a year.<br />
<br />
And according to the first place I found here (http://www.iowaworkforce.org/trends/percapita.html) the average per capita income for the United States is closer to 30,900 dollars a year.<br />
<br />
720 / 480 = 1.5 times the &quot;average&quot; Indian income.<br />
<br />
1.5 * 30,900 = 46,350<br />
<br />
So moving from 1000 Guides to 165 Indians &quot;saves&quot; SOE ( (945 - 800) * 165) = 23,925 dollars a year. And lifts 165 Indians from what most Americans would call &quot;abject poverty&quot; to a &quot;living wage&quot; while for the Indians the 165 &quot;new employees&quot; are living on a &quot;princely income&quot; nearly DOUBLE that of their neighbors.<br />
<br />
We can presume similar savings for transfering the phone support people from California to India.<br />
<br />
40 U.S. phone support people at 30k = 1.2 million plus benifits<br />
400 Indian phone support people at 800 = 320,000 and no benifits<br />
<br />
400 Indian families now live at 1.5 times the average income.<br />
<br />
SOE turns about 1 million bucks more profit.<br />
<br />
40 U.S. families now have to look for new jobs. And remember. They are phone support people. And I can buy 10 times as many man-hours for 1/4 the raw cost and no benifits by hiring outsourcing from India.<br />
<br />
Excuse me while I go be violently ill. :steamed:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As I recall DELL tried to do the same thing with their customer support for their Computer Systems. They even had the phone calls made to the 1-800 number routed around to India.<br />
<br />
And you know what drove Americans here crazy about it? Not the $$$, or the lost jobs... <br />
<br />
But the heavy Indian Accented English. The average American could not understand what the average Indian Computer Technican was asking them to do (or try to do to resolve the problem). Even my mother ran into it... and complained about the accent, and about the in-adequacies of the &quot;Scripted&quot; tech support. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your computer doesn't recognize the CD-ROM?.... Hmmm.. TRY 1. Try turning the Computer On. 2. Reboot the machine. 3. Try Cleaning the CD-ROM. 4. Try a Different CD-ROM. 5. Bring machine up in SAFE-Mode, with CD-ROM Driver active. 6. Turn off all other Drivers... etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
The eventual problem that was discovered without tech support help? - The CD-ROM Connector cable (which had been unhooked and re-hooked, had a bent pin.<br />
<br />
Companies are always trying to save money &quot;creatively&quot;... but the fail to at times recognize the inherent (read as HIDDEN) value provided by the highly paid technical support they currently have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the Guide program is not being closed down.  Guides will no longer be answering petitions or have any access to the petition queue.  But they will be allowed to run quests and events instead.  A lot of Guides are not at all happy about this change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>thrashette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, this flight to third world countries sucks.  I know exactly how much, being the ONE person in my department who didn't get to train his Chinese replacement last year.<br />
<br />
Nowadays I have conference calls when I should be sleeping with people whose speech I cannot understand.  They have no incentive to keep records or provide continuity of service, because they could lose thier contract tomorrow to the NEXT low bidder in the NEXT third world country.<br />
<br />
These guys are the most nepotistic, NDA breaking, technology stealing bunch I have seen in my life.  We ask for a new resource, and we get someone's brother.  We have them design something under NDA and thier sister firm sends us a low price for manufacturing it before we send out the bid package.   They copy our requirements documents to use as specs on some project they are working for someone else.  Our custom designs show up in our competitors products.  We find our technology being sold under another name in thier home country.  Our custom tools are used by these guys at our competitors shops, and our 'not to be distributed' code somehow makes its way from out contractor to third party sites that we do other business with.<br />
<br />
Did I mention that these guys are the BEST there is and that we fired three predecessor companies who were incompetent as well as being scoundrels?  Retraining the Latest New Guys was, er, tense.<br />
<br />
I'm not bitter.  New sleep habits aside, I STILL have a better job than anyone that I have EVER met.  It's just that I see the writing on the wall and it makes me tense.  My Fortune 500 technology company wants to become a CEO, a Diversity Director, and an Accounting Firm who can have big Profit Parties to which the Engineers are Not Invited.<br />
<br />
IMHO, that's a losing strategy if you are a technology company.  Cuz, you know, SOMEBODY has to do the technology part, and we are FAST running out of competent third-worlders. You guys probably don't know it, but underdeveloped areas attrit talent like crazy.  When the talented people are all snapped up, those companies start outsourcing to each other for the very reason that we hired them: it's too expensive to sustain the business otherwise.<br />
<br />
That's why high-tech design has gone from Silicon Valley to Japan to Taiwan to Mainland China to India in 3 year cycles over the last 12 years.  It's also why Sub-Saharan Africa had better start developing those BIOS writing skills because by 2008 the rest of the world's skill base will be overpriced and laid off.<br />
<br />
Now, let me rant a bit about software support.<br />
<br />
NOBODY can do decent support in a modern software environment.  It's just impossible.<br />
<br />
There's no money in software any more to do it the way it should be done.  You have to pay for the support staff somehow, and there's just no way to do it.  You can go retail, but you make only $12 a copy and have to eat all the unsold units every time you make a new version.  You can go Web-only and pay for bandwidth out the rear, but you will lose big share to the pirates and the people who won't buy online.  Or you can OEM it and make $0.10 a copy, HOPING you get a big enough contract to do 10 million a year.  No matter what you do, unless you have a nice vertical niche or are the market leader, you just can't afford a decent sized support staff.  If you are the market leader, you have penetrated to the people who are still trying to figure out how to use the mouse, and your support budget is eaten up by teaching or deflecting them.  If you have a vertical niche, you are concentrating on your money customers at the expense of all others.  To relate this back to Everquest...thier biggest CR problem is scammers and hackers.  The bigger and older thier game is, the more of those there are.  So they have to do something about it and cutting costs where they can is one of those things.<br />
<br />
Secondly. you have people like me playing Stump The Field Engineer for 40 hours a week.  Simply put, software QA sucks in this day and age.  Every single week I find problems that simply should NEVER have gotten out of the coding lab. I get them fixed, or I fire the vendor.  To many of my software vendors, me firing them means they are going out of business next year.  So when you wonder why you as an end-user aren't getting any help on your minor issue, you can curse the developers because my major issue is ahead of you in line. I don't think that I need to say anything about Sony/Verant/989 QA to this audience to make it relevant. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, while there are great telephone techs out there, there's no way to keep a talent pool current on software that revises every 6 months.  Just learning app functionality is a full-time job. God forbid that the thing runs on multiple OS platforms, or has a bunch of variant code trees.  Small companies with simple apps can keep up, and they do the best job at it.  Something like PhotoShop has a small army of engineers simply to track and fix KNOWN bugs.  Those guys have zero time to teach support, and they keep the target moving by adding new code every day. So the first answer 90 percent of the time is 'get the latest version' because that's the only way to establish a baseline where the phone tech can have somebody who isn't on the phone 35 hours a week help him help you.  And if by chance you call in with a known, publicised bug,  a schoolkid can read you the script as well as anyone. <br />
<br />
Lastly, we have the problem of complexity.  I have a GOOD lab.  It's got every possible model of PC in it, along with every OS and peripheral known to man.  I've got tools so good that my suppliers go out of thier way to steal them.  Customers STILL bring up problems that I can't replicate on identical hardware and, as far as they can tell me, identical software.  They critsit bugs that are so mysterious that we run ten machines for weeks solid in the HOPES that we can see something similar.  They do this often enough, on software that is SO generic, that we start wondering whether our customers are humans or magic problem making elves.  <br />
<br />
So I  get failing systems shipped to us when I have to. More often than not, I find out something like Mickey's Memory Challenge failed uninstall, leaving half a DLL that makes the Internet Porn License Manager disable the floppy drive.  And the only thing the support guys can tell the customer is to keep the Mouse away from the Body Parts. The customer sees this as no answer because his CEO insists on having both MMC and Daily Derrieres on the box along with the other software that we gave him. So we get the rap for crappy support, even though the problem is Too Many Apps Doing Too Many Things They Ought Not To Do.  If you've played EverQuest for very long you know that it does a LOT of things it shouldn't do, and that some other apps and drivers do things that interfere with EQ for no good reason too.<br />
<br />
I know this was long. Sorry.  Itek's right.  Sony should do better. <br />
<br />
They just can't, and I know why, and now maybe you have an inkling too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to work in support for a very large company.  Telephone support is expensive.  Very very very expensive. <br />
<br />
You need technicians to answer calls, and in the US they are paid anywhere from $7 to $15 per hour, + bennefits (usually).  You need hundreds of them if you do 24 hour support.  You need 1-800 line or the equivalent.  And those calls are costly.  Every moment a customer waits listening to crappy hold-music costs big dollars.   And if you don't get the support part right after the customer waited 20-30 mins to talk to a human, you get a bad rep for support. <br />
<br />
It's expensive as all heck.  <br />
<br />
I don't like it, especially as I'm an out of work programmer myself, but I at least know why it's happening.  <br />
<br />
It's the same reason farmers hire guys from across the border to pick grapes and lettuce.  It's the reason Queen Isabella was willing to hoc her jewels to finance Columbus.   It's why shirts are sewn in sweat-shops, not nice factories.   It's all about the money.   People want to make it, not spend it.  <br />
<br />
This is not some plea to &quot;buy American,&quot; or block job expoprts, or close the borders.   It's just my frustrated but clear view of the problem.   We want more than we're willing to pay for.   <br />
<br />
The ruthless drive to cut costs and bring a product to market at a price that people will buy has places it hurts.   As long as you want to buy shirts for $12 or less, and grapes under $2/lb, these sorts of things will happen.  It's no different with EQ.  You want it for $13 or less per month.  Sony has to keep the cost down to a point they can make a profit at that price.  <br />
<br />
It sucks.  Especially for those guys in San Diego who will loose jobs.   But I don't know what else we can really expect Sony to do. <br />
<br />
I don't know.  Perhaps in the not too distant future, there will be another economic shift, and we'll eventually correct for these issues, and people won't be screaming about jobs moving away.  But I'm not holding my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But the thing is Lothay, we're not seeing any kind of cost benefit to this.<br />
<br />
EQ costs the same now as it did 3-6 months ago.<br />
<br />

This isn't a case of &quot;We'll move to India, and our customers will be happy because they're saving 2 bucks a month&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's &quot;We'll move to India,  and profits will go up by XX, while customers won't see any benefit from this&quot;.<br />

While the whole &quot;I want to shop at walmart for their rock bottom prices&quot; and &quot;Darn you Walmart for being unethical and underhanded&quot; syndrome *IS* rampant in society, outsourcing CS to India is NOT an example of it.    At least not in this case.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree Lilosh<br />
<br />
I'd be happy for this if it meant CS was actually going to improve in EQ for once.  I don't believe for a minute they are doing it as an improvement but as yet another way to cut every corner to maximize profits for EverQuest at our expense.  <br />
<br />
I remember several years ago when Aradune cited the reason CS couldn't be improved much is because the monthly fee ($10 at the time) was very cheap and, basically, you get what you pay for.  However, since that time EverQuest has Legends (4x the monthly fee from many players) increased the monthly fee by 25%, now charges for players to change servers (fully geared and not) and names, and gets a huge increase in profits on expansions now that people can download them.  You'd think some of that money could go to improving CS.<br />
<br />
*grumble* Sorry, this is really one of the things with EverQuest that continues to get under my skin and the primary reason that I will not be buying EQ2 or any other SOE products in the near future.</div></div><hr />

It could be though. If SoE wanted to make up the profits without outsourcing their Customer Support they would increase the fee we pay for service. So there are some benefits to the players though many don't seem to think that way.<br />
<br />
p.s. Personally I have worked in customer service for 10 years. I am not particularly keen on speaking to people I can't communicate with clearly. it's for this reason I think that the call center in India will be difficult.</div></div><hr />

Support on the legends server is so much better than your typical blue server it's not funny (every petition I've put in is responded to in less than an hour - not that I petition a lot).<br />
<br />
Legends is also BY FAR the lowest population server (like less than Sullon, fewer than 200 traders at peak low) - because people don't want to pay for the service there.<br />
<br />
No sympathy here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Itek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Wired article that Dunthor links to points something out fairly clearly.<br />
<br />
Decent experienced software engineer in US $70,000<br />
<br />
Equivalent software engineer in India $11,000<br />
<br />
Average income in US $31,000<br />
<br />
Average income in India $500<br />
<br />
Gee... for 1/3 the money I can buy twice the NUMBER of engineers and they worship the ground I -walk- on cause they make _22_FRIGGIN_TIMES_ the national average instead of just 2.3 time the national average.<br />
<br />
I've seen it happen in manufacturing. While I was working in Bloomington, IN area as phone desktop support GE moved their plant to Mexico. Was an easy decision for them. $18 an hour or $2 an hour. Gee... no GE.<br />
<br />
This should be a wake up call. When the mid paying manufacturing jobs moved to Central America and the Asian Rim we saw some huge effects. But now we are seeing upper middle class jobs, very good paying jobs, flee in growing numbers.<br />
<br />
Think I'm crazy. Check out the Master / PhD thesis defense page (http://cse.asu.edu/news/Announcements/Defenses/defenses.shtml) for the college I'm going to.<br />
<br />
It's sort of funny to see the number of Asian/Indian candidates to number of American candidates ratio. (for instance last fall there were NO American born Master / PhD candidates in Computer Science, and ASU is a fairly big school)<br />
<br />
Getting 3 jobs at Taco Bell isn't going to make up for losing a software development job.<br />
<br />
At what point do we see that if we continue to move jobs, and there-by income, outside of the U.S. that the ability to BUY these lovely products is reduced.<br />
<br />
The &quot;business minds&quot; have forgotten a key element of competition. (I'm -all- in favor of competition.) Struggling to gain a piece of the pie or a larger piece of the pie is great. But it's important to remember that if what you do to GET a bigger piece of the pie makes the pie IN TOTAL smaller... it's self-defeating. &quot;Thou shalt not ruin thine own market to gain market share.&quot;<br />
<br />
All those that play EQ and have a technology-related job in the family raise their hands.<br />
<br />
Anyone wanna bet that at least 20% of the EQ players fall into that category?<br />
<br />
Personally I'm wondering if Gates is an expansion I can afford. My wife and I both worked in tech-related industries. Now after the second lay-off in 3 years she's working phone support. In a department ALREADY scheduled to be shipped to India in September. (She's a temp.) I've been out of work for 3 full years. I'm working 20 hours a week in a laundry and back to school for a B.S.C.S degree that might be utterly worthless by the time I finish in 2006.<br />
<br />
I got 3 telemarketing calls last night. 2 were from India.<br />
<br />
So, let's look for jobs that CAN'T be shipped over the border. Cause otherwise &quot;it's more cost effective&quot; will be the epithap written on the tombstone of our economy.<br />
<br />
HINT: Figure out when the &quot;Baby Boomers&quot; will start to retire and draw on Social Security.<br />
<br />
HINT: 1945 + 65 = 2010<br />
<br />
When 50% of the people in this country are of retirement age, and another 20-25% are under 18, the remaining 25-30% will be earning ALL the income for the entire country. If all the manufacturing, support, and engineering jobs are outside the U.S. on that day... (remember the Indian economy has grown 49% in the last decade, with increasing growth rates every year, so that in the next 5 years it could potentially grow another 40%, all from foreign jobs)<br />
<br />
2010, Baby Boomers start to retire in massive numbers.<br />
<br />
2020, Over half the Boomers are now retired.<br />
<br />
So grab a calculator and figure out where you are in 16 years.<br />

I can't help but be amused how alarmed the western world is when the negative side effects of the much praised globalization start showing at their side of the deal too.<br />

It's something you can't as easily discard as a 3rd world farmer losing his livelihood because of the artificially low prices of agriculture goods on the world market due to subsidy from western governments.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Last year, I worked for a big named company in Colorado Springs. You probably own a computer, printer or scanner made by that company. Morale was so low among the FTE (full time employees) that they talked about 2 things: the CEO's new $60,000,000 (each) bizjets, or who else is getting offshored to India. Morale was so low that many people did not show up on Fridays: that was the day that people could get laid off. Every Friday between 10 and 200 people would be laid off. The guards had to have double the regular number on Fridays just in case. The parking lot on Fridays usually looked like the parking lot on Saturday: less than half full. And the folks getting laid off were not deadwood. Some get described in terms like: the last person who understands product X (still being sold to customers), or the last person able to repair and maintain alpha servers (the largest client, a government lab located in Los Alamos, NM, uses large numbers of alpha servers along with the network storage products made in the Colorado Springs facility). {First name bleeped} new bizjets cost the same as 1,000 workers per year. Annual maintainence on them is several million dollars per year. But the old planes were not sexy enough. So the bogus cost cutting makes the stock go up a tiny bit, so her bonus goes way up.<br />

There have been a few scandals with offshoring, and they will only get worse:<br />
1 - A company contracts out confidential data about abused women and their children (http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4186130/). OMG! think of the children!<br />
2 - Medical transcriptions get used for extortion (http://www.csoonline.com/read/010104/machine.html)<br />

It is my measured opinion that none of the politicians, nor CEOs understand the danger to the US of their actions. I think that they are incapable of understanding the long term consequences of these actions because they are only interested in their bonuses for the next quarter. Henry Ford understood it 100 years ago when he realized that paying his workers higher wages meant that they could also afford to buy the products they made.<br />

When the US moved from an agricultural economy to a manufacturing one, there was unsettlement and hard times for some. But there were jobs to replace those lost. When the US changed from a manufacturing economy to a service one, there was unsettlement and hard times for many. But there were jobs to replace those lost. When the US moved from a service economy to an information economy, there was unsettlement and hard times for some. But there were jobs to replace those lost. Now that the US is offshoring those information and service jobs, what is left? What jobs are there for the million Americans who have lost their jobs in the last 3 years? <br />

Offshoring has cost me a house, a car and most of the things I had placed in storage. Don't think that is not painful. Do not pretend that I am the only one reduced to penury. I am a couple of months away from living under a bridge. Being in my mid 40s, most companies will not consider me for employment, even for menial stuff like pushing shopping carts back into the store. Having used up a lifetime's allowance of unemployment claims in one state, it will be April before this unemployed engineer/programmer is able to apply for unemployment in this new state. Due to the way the unemployment numbers are twisted around, only 3 of last year's 10 months of unemployment count in the nationwide unemployment statistics: when your benefits expire, you are no longer counted as unemployed. If the unemployment statistics included those whose benefits expired, or the folks on disability (until 2001, folks in disability were included as unemployed), the unemployment rate in the US would be over 10%.<br />
<br />
The US is turning into a nation where there will be only 2 classes of people: managers and serfs. I think the shining example of this trend is the big shopping store that people either love or hate. Managers earn over $100,000 per year. The hourly staff earn so little that 15% of them qualify for food stamps. You can't buy a house and support a family on $16,000 per year in most parts of the US.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye the trend is disturbing... for me it is disturbing because in my experience, the customer service from offshore personnel is worse then the service I got in the US.<br />

A Major Fortune 500, that was once run by Jack Welch, decided to put their in house IT tech support in India.  For 100 positions, they had 40,000 applications.  They even gave them American sounding names like &quot;Bob&quot; &quot;Joe&quot; and &quot;Sally&quot;.  <br />
<br />
They trained them very well, BUT the problem was no one believed Bob was a native English speaker.  Customer support started out with questions like &quot;Is your computer on&quot; after the person just finished explaining that when they attempted to access the network, the computer indicated that they were denied access.  <br />
<br />
The troubleshooting followed a script regardless of the problem (printer problems had the same script as Xray machine software).  It was only until they brought in a linguistic coach and some 'creative thinker professionals' that this company even began to see some satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Being unemployed in IT, I don't want to see all the jobs go over sees - because if those of us in the US are unemployed, who buys the products that are being support off shore?  It is a vicious circle.  But I get thoroughly fed up when someone doesn't understand my problem.  I don't care where they are located, but I expect a company to produce quality (yeah I know rare concept) and when quality isn't there, and the customer support isn't there, I have to wonder, how the company will stay in business.<br />
<br />
I was interested though that SoE says they have customer support because the last time I called their number - the message stated that the only technical support available was via the internet or in game.  So, for me, having tech support in India doesn't exist for me.  I guess if you have no customer support it really doesn't matter where you put it :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
