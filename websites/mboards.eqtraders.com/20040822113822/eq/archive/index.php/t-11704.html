<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>altius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just did a session on these and did about 60 combines with one skill up. thats sick. <br />
<br />
and my dex was 275 and wis around 230<br />
<br />
now i do about 20 to 30 attempts on darkwood for 1 skill up<br />
<br />
and like 40 to 50 ? on arrows per skill up <br />
<br />
anyone know the rate per skill up on these ?<br />
<br />
<br />
gotta say though i do like the alternate route though it will only take me to about 220 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why are you doing sedgewood to 220 skill ?<br />
<br />
If you are going the store bought route, then darkwood + hemp is much cheaper. That will take you to 215.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What bow did you do with sedgewood to get to 220?<br />
<br />
I used sedgewood in the 202-215 range (though i got very few skill ups, actually) and I think all of the compounds end up trivialing at 215.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My bad...I got confused with sedgewood and shadewood. Dang names are too similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>altius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ya the sedgewood gave out at like 215 and tell  ya the truth it probably wouldtnt have been to different if i would have jus stuck with hemp and dark till that but o well. <br />
<br />
<br />
got my skill to 231 and gave out. <br />
<br />
took me around 30k to go from 207 to 231 and all i have is like 12k left so gonna save up another 30 or 40k and make the push to 250 on that though i suspect on 40k i will only make around 240-245 or so but thats cool enough with a geerlock.</div></div><hr />
