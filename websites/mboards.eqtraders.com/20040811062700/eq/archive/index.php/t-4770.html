<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before I put it up on Zabumule and offer it to the masses, I ended up with a bit of extra inventory in the viscious mana department.  I think I have between 5 and 6 stacks available right now.  10p per vial, in any quantity.  Once it hits the bazaar, I'm probably going with the lowest prevailing price, currently about 12p.<br />
<br />
I also have about 25 more stacks of zombie skins and can begin the process of making more if you need it.  (It's a great thing to do when watching television.  With my current INT and no KEI, I can only do about 7 casts per mana bar, so there is a lot of down time.)<br />
<br />
I will also be putting up a stack or two each of enchanted clay and enchanted silver, quantity initially dependent on what I have left in the bank.  If anyone needs these, say the word.  The Sprowt was made for this specific purpose (although, now I wish I would have PLed him a bit less to get his combat skills a bit higher, I think I might like to play him beyond his current level.)</div></div><hr />
