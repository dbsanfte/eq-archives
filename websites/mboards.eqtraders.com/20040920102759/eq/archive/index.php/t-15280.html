Was it like 500k Plat?<br />
If I were to stop at skill 200......how much would that cost?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Obviously, your experience can differ, but at 255 wisdom, I did the following, more or less:<br />
<br />
To 199: Do poison vials, casseroles and such: very cheap.  Probably less than 1000 pp total.<br />
<br />
199-216: I got about one skillup per 17 tries, but that was pre-nerf, so expect it to be about twice that now.  I did opal steins (cost 22 pp, sold all of them for 15-20 pp) and unfired planar steins (made them all into planar peridot steins and sold half, used half for experience, but again that was before they nerfed the experience payoff on the quest (honest, I didn't know it was excessively high experience, and I only turned in about 30)).  So, at 22 pp each for opal steins and 16 each for planar steins, expect to spend about 10k, not counting selling the mugs in the Bazaar, which will get you back about 6500 plat.  Sellbacks to merchants will only net you about 1200.<br />
<br />
217-222: I did opal steins exclusively to 222, since I didn't need mana vials for them, and the steins sell (below cost, but the rings don't sell at all).  Again, expect about one skillup per 30 tries at 255 wisdom, or 180 mugs.<br />
<br />
223-241: I did a mix of crucibles of escape ( I fired them and sold them all for 235 pp each) and unfired idols (Quellious, the Tribunal and two stacks of Bristlebane).  Total for the idols are 15 pp plus the cost of the gem, plus imbuing/enchanting costs.  Costs for the crucible is 8 pp unfired (do this if you're just practicing) or 50 pp for fired.  Also pre-nerf, I got about 1 skillup for 18 combines.  The idols don't sell at all so it's all lost money.  Considering the five stacks of crucibles were a profit leader (made about 2000 pp net for those stacks) I spent a total of  6000 plat.  Remember that these prices reflect the fact that I got all (I say again, ALL) of my mana vials for the cost of components, and ALL of my imbues done for free.  If you need to hire someone to do this sort of thing, or pay premium for materials, you'll spend a lot more.<br />
<br />
So, it is cheaper than fletching, but not cheaper than jewelcrafting.  And none of them are cheap.  But it is doable without a raid guild bankroll behind you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elmier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well,<br />
<br />
For me pottery from 199 to 250 cost me 50k. I found brewing to be cheapest to 250, with JC second as it only cost me 9k to do JC from 0 to 250 in 10 hours, used the guide on RPGexpert. Oh and I am a ranger with a 305 Wisdom. I would also like to add that now I am using Pottery, to fund my last two skills (smithing and tailoring) in their quest from 220 to 250.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">according to my skill up notes (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12997), I did 1703 combines from 200 to 250 at 16.388pp each, for a total of 27,908.764pp. 1-200 took less than 500pp (I don't keep track pre-200).<br />
<br />
roughly 28,000pp to GM pottery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whatever.  I didn't do JC when you could enchant the stuff and lose barely any PP.  Compared to the other skills I've maxed it seemed like I had to do an asstastic amount of combines in JC which of course resulted even in more costly failures.  Fletching I failed hardly anything but the sheer attrition of the combines is what hurt so bad.</div></div><hr />

199 to 246 was all rings and unfired idols.  Easily spending in the neighborhood of 30K.  Most of the cost is on gems and vials - i traded imbuing of emeralds (through my druid) for imbuing of the gems i needed for the idols.  <br />

Though I want to get to 250, I'd rather spend the 4K or so on just about anything else, like the tailoring I'm working on.<br />

<br />
Tailoring should be more expensive then smithing, I think. Farming rockhoppers for tailoring generates a LOT of hides usable for fine steel skillups. I started downgrading medium and HQ hopperhides after I had 4 stacks of HQ hide around. <br />
<br />
Also, you can PBAE smithing components in a lot of zones, while wyvern and rockhopper hides require quadding in a few (usually overcrowded) zones, or even single kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Iumini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I made 250 in profit by selling my wares in the bazaar. I think i made 250 in about december 2003.  The main advantage i had was I had a levle 62 chanter with horse for the huge amount of vials etc and i am a cleric worshipping CT. I did all combines after 199  at 280 wis with a geer lock.<br />
<br />
I made mainly opal steins 199-222. Making in batches of 40 and selling in bazaar before I made more. Prices varied from 15-30 so sometimes I made money sometimes lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
At 222 i started making golden idols of tunare (80-90 percent sucessrate at this skill plus geer lock) in batches of 4 or 5. I would then sell these inbazaar for 600-1k depending on current price. I think i got 2 skill ups on these total but they made enough profit to fund a huge number of<br />
idol of cazic thules I made and destroyed. I also did some cruciples of escape those these don't sell well.<br />
<br />
From 248-250 I made star ruby steins making about 50 percent and selling at 200 ish I made a small profit.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are in a hurry you will loose money but if you have the time to wait to sell you wears to players you can do it without too much cost</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aalar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The key here is time.  Less time to skill up = more plat.  More time to skill up = less plat.  The more time would involve doing a lot of ones's own farming.  And farming itself will bring one additional cash in form of PC sellable loot - vendor trash loot and just straight cash.  Less time would be going to bazaar and buying something someone else has spent time farming.  It just depends on what you are willing to do.<br />
<br />
When I was skilling up thru the lower ranks of smithing I didn't want to spend a lot of money doing it.  I went the ornate chain route so I needed lots of HQ ore - I just didn't want to pay for it.  So I went to Sol A with a bunch of empty backpacks and killed everything there (made many trips).  The gobs drop lots of FS and some HQ ore and unrefined ore and plat and other items.  I converted the FS into HQ ore - sold the vendor trash drops.  I actually ended up several thousand plat richer going up to 158 skill in smithing.  If you have the time I suggest you take this route to 158 skill in smithing.  And as a side benefit I knwo Sol A really really well now.  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fulminate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yesterday and today I did 1000 pottery combines, and went from 200 to 229.<br />
<br />
The cost was about 17 pp ea for the first 800 (planar and opal steins), and about 30 pp ea for the last 200 (white rings)... making it about 20,000 pp total.  <br />
<br />
This is more than I spent on getting JC from 200 to 250.  Despite each individual combine being cheaper, the skill up rate for pottery seems a good deal lower than that for JC, and the products produced dont sell back to vendors for very much at all.  <br />
<br />
I expect the last 21 ups wil cost me as much or more, and be more difficult to achieve, since my enchanter mule is only level 24, and cant make the level 29 mana vials needed past 231.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Elmier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well,<br />
<br />
      I did expensive method, of steins. Cost me abut 35k total to get to 250. But I have more than made 5 times that in profit from Golden Idols of Tunare. So, some of the tradeskills can pay for themselves without a major amount of flagging done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aalar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think pottery is one of the skills an unflagged individual can make a tidy profit from.  A lot of the nice items can be farmed from the lower level PoP zones.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite spots to farm items is the PoF where the charm birds spawn.  They are on a 3 day spawn, more or less.  So if you are able to solo there you can kill the magmas which drop solidified magma which is used to make the ceramic incense burner of Ro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think Silverfish's way of skilling up is less than admirable.  EQ Traders has a guide where you can level up to Mastery by doing bowels in succession for less than 100pp.  Then choose your route to go from there.  I would have to agree with the majority here, after reading the EQT guides I spent less than a few hundred pp to get to 200.  Vials were most exspensive in components to make.  I got greedy and just wanted to get to 200 so I bought from Bazaar, but you could farm your own stuff that you need til 200 cap, or 198 rather.</div></div><hr />

This sentence leads me to believe he may not realize that one can use Crow's Special Brew for poison vials.  Doing it with pelts or skins can get very costly in time and materials, but in the Abysmal Sea that's not necessary, so it's easy and much cheaper than anything the Bazaar can provide.<br />

I mastered Pottery in the old days, back when new UI's weren't the only thing making me want to participate.  And as far as being less than admirable, it is and I'll tell you why.  From to 122 can be done for less than 30pp.  Do Medium Unfired Bowls and destroy the unfired bowl portion of the product.  Firing them costs money, it does not raise the resale value at anything that should concern a Potter, and just takes up more bag space.  AFter 122, go to large bowls, then vials to 198.  Casserole dishes to 199, and then I moved up to Planar Steins for the last point since I was hunting in Earth at this time and getting a fair load of Tainted Planar Essence.  It cost me close to nothing to get to 200.  I don't see it costing me more than av average of around 10-15k to get to 250 with the new Planar pottery.<br />
<br />
Now if I'm wrong and you can prove to me that you CAN NOT get to 200 for under 500pp, PLEASE point it out and why.  That's all I'm saying, it can be done for far less than that guide, and why someone would rather spend more money than not is another issue, but it definitely wasn't the cheapest way to get to Grandmastery is all.<br />
<br />
And SIlver, you are right on that point.  The new Crows Brew option leaves this tradeskill as an option for a lot who might have been too scared to try it.  Abysmal Sea has taken the hassle out of reserving tradeskill nights now so you can deal with the stress, remember those times? :)  Anyways,  it was a good thing to mention that and I wish that was an option for me before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>karoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i've just gone from 244 to 249 pottery in one sitting, it cost me 14,696pp exactly.<br />
<br />
thats making star ruby steins as a rogue with the following stats:<br />
<br />
cha for buying at 155 (plus average faction)<br />
<br />
int for combines at 153 (thats with a 10 peice suit of tradeskilling armour designed to raise int)<br />
<br />
i know it might've been cheaper to make idols and destroy them rather than fire them, but i've never made something just for a chance of a skillup, thats not being a craftsman, thats being a stamping press..<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Wystaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm not sure how much money I spent getting from 1 to 200, but from 200 to 250 it took me around 9,000 platinum or so w/ 355 int (not sure if this is much of a factor). Picked up Tainted Planar Essence on guild raids and made planar steins til 216 then worked on white ceramic bands and various deity-imbued steins. I averaged 1 or 2 skill ups per 20 combines, and didn't bother firing/selling anything back (too lazy, not enough space). Enchanted and imbued my own stuffs with the help of my boyfriend, though, so that probably cut costs. <br />
<br />
-- Wystaria,<br />
who spent a lot more cash on JC than pottery</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Turner_USA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">How the hell does it cost you people that much to get to 250.<br />
<br />
From 199-250 why not make Deity specific steins?<br />
<br />
For example the Cazic Thule Stein:<br />
1 Idol Sketch 1s<br />
1 Amber 2p3g3s<br />
1 Large Block of Clay 1g1s<br />
1 Poison Vial 1p5g8s<br />
1 Emerald 13p6g5s<br />
<br />
TOTAL: 17p5g5s<br />
<br />
so if you do 1000 combines that should cost about 17.5k if you can skill up on an average of 1 in 20.  And you can get someone to do the enchants and imbues for free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Because we're lazy.  Vials of X mana can generally be found in the bazaar.  Imbued gems generally cannot.<br />
<br />
Personally its not worth it to me to hunt up someone to imbue that many gems, then wait for them to do it, then pay them for their services just to save a little money.<br />
<br />
Star ruby steins only cost about 70pp to make and sellback to merchant for a good portion of that.<br />
<br />
Factor in the cost of paying someone to imbue (I personally don't just ask people out of the blue to imbue hundreds of gems at all... I certainly wouldn't ask them to do it for free) and you're only saving 20 or 30pp per combine going that route.  It will also take you a lot longer due to fhe time to find an imbuer and time to do all the imbues.<br />
<br />
To me, this is a trivial amount of platinum... my time is more valuable than that.<br />
<br />
Obviously, I'm not alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Guessing it cost me about $26-27k total.  Opal steins to 222, mix of crucibles and idols to 235, idols beyond.  Most my wis was at during it was 280, I lost track but I think I was averaging about a skill up per 28-30 combines. Imbued my own pebbles, bought mana in bazaar, as well as some other imbued stones when I ran out of pebbles - and they were hard to find in the bazaar most of the time.  If someone is getting pottery at 1 per 20 they are very lucky.  (Baking was at 1 in 24 for me.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aweluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">well for me to get to 222 so far has costed me about 10k. i did opal steins to 222 then a round of star rubies to 227. that is bout 6k for 100 combines. i have a friend ench so i dc him to do all my enchanting. dont think ill keep going the star ruby way unless i have extra after finishing tailoring and fletching. i was successful on first attempt on scared urn combines, thank Tunare!<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. i didnt check the resale back to vendor on star rub stein cause opal was 2cp unfired and 4sp fired(which is the cost of metal) next time i long in ill check for sure</div></div><hr />
