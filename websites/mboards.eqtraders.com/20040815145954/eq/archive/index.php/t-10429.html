<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dratt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question about logging out in the middle of a skillup.  The only reason i ask this is I have done over 200 combines for level 208 JC and have not had a skill up yet.  I'm just curious as I have logged out a couple of times in those 200 combines if the skillup rate resets?  200+ combines for 208 seems a bit much too me.   Anyways thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

There used to be a bug where you could go linkdead right in the middle of a combine and you would lose all the ingredients but the combine never really happened.  In that case that ONE combine wouldn't count toward your total.  But in every other case logging or going linkdead shouldn't matter at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dratt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well poo then. :(  Guess it's just my bad luck...I'll get back to plugging away.  <br />
<br />
BTW is there a thread on the longest number of combines between skillups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not that i know of.  try the search feature.  i think i saw someone with 280 combines without skillup.  can't remember for sure though.</div></div><hr />
