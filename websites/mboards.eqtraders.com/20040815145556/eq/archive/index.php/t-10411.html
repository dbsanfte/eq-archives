<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cedir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">According to the recently published chat, there are new JC recipies in LDoN, but I have not been able to find a new JC recipe book.<br />
<br />
Tonight, I will attempt some random combines of stuff from the new dungeons with happy silver bars to see if I get anything.<br />
<br />
In the mean time... has anybody else found any JCable drops in the dungeons?  Post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cedir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Beta just went down for a 30 minute patch.  I asked in chat whether anybody had found JC components, since it had been indicated there would be new JC recipies, and there is no JC book.  A guide responded that it was being added in either *this* or the *next* patch.<br />
<br />
So there you have it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cedir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A new JC recipe book has been added.  It talks about combining Geode, Amethyst, and Polished Quartz with Silver, Electrum, Gold, Platinum, and Velium bars.  It gives some hints about the stats, as well.<br />
<br />
My interpretation of the stat hints was that Geode would give STR and STA; Amethyst would give SvD, SvP, and HP; and Polished Quartz would give INT and WIS (and possibly MANA).<br />
<br />
The three new stones, I presume, only drop in LDoN zones.  They are dropable.  I bought some Geode off a merchant for about 25p a piece.<br />
<br />
It's worth noting that the book specifically says that combines may be made with or without enchanting the metal bars.  Does that mean that you will get stats either way?  I'm not sure.  Until I've tested with enchanted bars, I'm not going to be wasting suplies on non-enchanted ones.<br />
<br />
I was only able to do a few combines, but here's what I've got so far:<br />
<br />
Geode + Enchanted Silver Bar = Silver Geode Ring<br />
AC+1, STR+2, STA+2, slot type 1<br />
<br />
Geode + Enchanted Electrum Bar = Electrum Geode Ring<br />
AC+2, STR+3, STA+3, slot type 1<br />
<br />
Geode + Enchanted Gold Bar = Gold Geode Ring<br />
AC+3, STR+5, STA+5, slot type 1<br />
<br />
Geode + Enchanted Platinum Bar = Platinum Geode Necklace<br />
AC+4, STR+7, STA+7, slot type 1<br />
<br />
Geode + Enchanted Velium Bar = Velium Geode Bracelet<br />
AC+5, STR+8, STA+8, slot type 1<br />
<br />
Polished Quartz + Enchanted Silver Bar = Silver Polished Quartz Ring<br />
AC+1, WIS+2, INT+2, MANA+5, slot type 1<br />
<br />
Polished Quartz + Enchanted Electrum Bar = Electrum Polished Quartz Ring<br />
AC+2, WIS+3, INT+3, MANA+10, slot type 1<br />
<br />
Amethyst + Enchanted Silver Bar = Silver Amethyst Ring<br />
AC+2, HP+5, SvD+2, SvP+2, slot type 1<br />
<br />
Amethyst + Enchanted Electrum Bar = Electrum Amethyst Ring<br />
AC+3, HP+10, SvD+3, SvP+3, slot type 1<br />
<br />
The combines with Silver, Electrum, and Gold were trivial at 250.  The combines with Platinum and Velium were *not* trivial at 250.  They all sold back to vendors for *mere* 1 gold, 9 silver... so these items must be intended to be marketable (it's far too big a loss to be used for skill).<br />
<br />
I'm a little dissappointed that these items only have slot type 1, unlike the new smithing recipes.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
I will edit this post if I find more.<br />
<br />
Edit 9/06 7:30pm EST - Found more.  I have now successfully done 9 out of the 15 new recipies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have screenshots to back this up , if need be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Platinum + Geode = Platinum Geode Necklace<br />
AC:4 , STA +7 , STR + 7<br />
<br />
Velium + Geode = Velium Geode BRACELET<br />
AC:5 , STA +8, STR +8<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And the real Goody came in a link , from a dev.<br />
<br />
Velium + Polished Quartz = Velium Polished Quartz Necklace<br />
AC:5 , WIS +8, INT +8, Mana + 25<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, and I had 3 Amethysts, and burned two of them in the bag, and finally succeeded on the Third, only to get a necklace with no stats.  I forgot, apparently, to enchant the last bar.<br />

<br />
Velium + Amethyst = Necklace with stats uknown.<br />

I mean, I'd bet a lot of jewelers don't forage.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am editing my original post to include my new findings.</div></div><hr />

It seems unlikely you'd be able to sell that bracelet for enough to cover the cost of the bar though, especially as it has the same slot as everything else.</div></div><hr />

Well, I wasn't making any kind of value judgment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK I think I have all of the above JC Items into the database. <br />
<br />
Please NOTE... some items are missing attributes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>birobinet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">remember that only enchanted metal gives items with stats (in regular jewellery as in LDoN one).</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I say &quot;Missing Attributes&quot; I mean things like their Weight, Size, Classes, Races, Dieties as well.<br />
<br />
Not just Modifications to player based attributes.<br />
<br />
TO properly flesh out the database, I need ALL of the Right-Click information presented.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats a **** nice ring for gold.  will have to get a few of those.  :)  what does the polished quartz sell for.  merchant standard ware or just mob dropped?  25pp and 10pp for a gold bar these will be nice rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chantos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I bought the stones in the bazaar for 49 pp each.  I understand they are forageable (for those who have forage) in the LDoN zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nex Alacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd like to see this bracelet turned into something like an earring.  I dont really see the point for a str/sta item with such low ac as a bracer.  I doubt even a monk would end up wearing that.  Anyone who agrees please /feedback so it can get changed, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lothay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well - you need to recall that not all items will be useful at the high-end of the game.  They will however be useful at the lower end of the game. <br />
<br />
I can easily see a low or mid-level character wearing many of these items and finding value in them.</div></div><hr />
