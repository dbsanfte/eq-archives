curently we have no listing of how much space the site itself uses (an error on the hosting side... but WELL bellow what we have alocated.  This is JUST the website, not the message boards)<br />

Those stats are only for the Website.  Not the message boards.<br />

$5.95 a month for basic hosting (200MB transfer), up to $12.95 (and 1.5GB transfer) if you need ASP support.  Also a very reasonable domain name registrar.</div></div><hr />

Ouchie 8-( that is kind of a rough price for going over. We just lowered our prices to $1.95 per unallocated GB of traffic. $1.60 per allocated GB of traffic.<br />

I am looking for public sites that are privately owned/operated that I can swap hosting space for unobtrusive advertising on. Just finished installing a brand new T3 circuit from Broadwing so we have 45Mbps of bandwidth waiting to get used.</div></div><hr />

OMG.<br />
<br />
WOw that does not even seem possible. OH that was the website, not the message boards.<br />

I'd no longer trust any kind of discounted ad traffic site for hosting. The bottom has already collapsed once and it is going to again, then again, then again. You'd be left counting on a discount after getting everything set up then in five months you'd be told that they can't do the discount anymore because of yet another collapse, or that now you need to have shockwave popups (Omg I hate those, considered actually totally disabling shockwave forcibly.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahzzmandius</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actualy, we don't exist based on add swapping.  I'm looking for special sites that are done well that could benifit from being supported by a company. The only difference being the site would still be 100% self owned and run (unlike the past few years of site acquisitions).<br />
<br />
The deal I would be giving would be like this. As long as you aren't making any money from the site itself, and carry our company name on it, then you get the hosting for free.  I also make it explicitly understood that my company would in no way have anything to do with the decisions, maintenance, or content  of the site. It's free to do whatever it wants as long as it's free and carrys our ad. <br />
<br />
It's merely a way of helping the worthwhile comunity groups survive so that they don't have to sell out as many popular sites did when their ISP bills went beyond the site owners ability to pay. If a site is that popular, truly independant, and of good quality, then the advertising would generate customers for me. Thus allowing me to allocate resources back to the site owner(s).<br />
<br />
I hope this aleviates any fears that I may be trying to start yet another of those schemes. It's very select. Only those that we have an interest in personaly will get accepted.   8)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was the sort of deal we had with Refplace for quite a while, before our traffic figures were high enough that Rory started wincing and hinting that it's be a really &quot;good thing&quot; to start making money.  That's when we started taking Paypal donations and started giving him the lion's share of them, until such time as we realized we were going to need a lot of extra bells and whistles to be able to do the long-dreamed-of-database, and moved to Racknine.</div></div><hr />

LMAO, Thats nothing you should see the stats on 2 Messageboards that I am on.<br />
<br />
1 - 1.2GB Transfer a MONTH<br />
2 - 450MB Transfer a MONTH<br />
<br />
What you are seeing for their site is not all that much at all honestly. But the site is really active I will say that much. Just keep this in mind when thinking of the transfer ammounts that you are looking at. Most 95% of eqtraders.com is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;TEXT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. I would assume that they are getting over 2million hits a month. If they would like I can make them a unabtrousive counter for all pages that can be appended to the end of each page to track that. but hits on the main site alone would blow some peoples minds. This IS the premier trade skill messageboard and website for all of Everquest hands down.</div></div><hr />

Checking forums, recipes, looking for stats, showing/looking something up for a fellow tradeskiller or guild mate.<br />
<br />
If I didn't have this site, I'd have nothing to do at work since all I do is babysit computers.<br />

<br />
We can't do MySQL, which I know many of you would suggest. It simply will not port over given the way the site was designed. We have to use the Micro$oft technology.<br />
