<br />
In looking at the recipe for the robe it indicates that the needle AND chain are returned on failure.  If that is the case..and most of the cost being in the chain....would it make sense to start robes real early?<br />
<br />
(Seems, like you'd hardly ever succeed...get skillups...and keep the chain)<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

With my luck, I'd get my 1 success in a hundred on the first try.  :(</div></div><hr />

1 or 2 robes per 20 combines up to 215ish skill<br />
5-7 robes per 20 combines up to 235ish skill<br />
8-12 robes per 20 combines 235-250 skill<br />
<br />
After 220 skill they succeed WAY to often. I found it cheaper to farm velium and do cobalt drake where I can at least sell the belts to recoup costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After I hit 187, I took a little break and slowly got ingredients together.<br />

I did 14 and then 49 solstice robes in two sessions.<br />
<br />
Session 1: Skill up and success on the very first try.  13 more tries, without a skil up, one additional success.<br />
<br />
Session 2: Total of 4 successes and 2 skill ups, one skill up on a success, one on a failure (the successes that yield skill ups feel much less wasteful!).<br />
<br />
<br />
So 6 successes on 63 tries, and 3 skill ups.</div></div><hr />

Don't in anyway get used to this skill up rate.  You just hit the 190s and with that more than likely you will have runs of 50+ and at least 1 run of 100+ to get skill ups.<br />
<br />
So, while these skill ups were nice, don't get used to it; you're only kidding yourself if you do grow to expect it.  In fact, report back later; you'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did Solstice robes all the way to 250, as they were the most economical option.  With Solstice robes, I spent about 100 on a failure and about 500 on a success.  Successes sold back in the bazaar fairly quickly at 300-400 each, so the net cost was 100-200 each.  The prices on Velious components, by comparison, were so high that it would cost me about 500 platinum per combine, and I'd end up with a worthless product that no one would buy.  The choice was pretty simple.<br />
<br />
You'll get minimum success rate (around 5%) until you hit around 210, then it will start climbing smoothly to about 45% at 250.  Successes are annoying but if you manage to sell them all in the bazaar you can mitigate your losses and still end up ahead compared to Velious tailoring.<br />
<br />
From the 180s to about 200, I got a skill point on average every 15 combines.  After 200, the average was more like 20-22.<br />
<br />
As for starting them pre-187, I wouldn't; ribbons are much cheaper and easier so milk them for as long as you possibly can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darksisco007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ive been getting roughly a 1/30 skill rate on them. From 187 to 193.  I must say its a huge pita to get the combines ready. So far ive gotten 2 pts per sitting</div></div><hr />
