<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kcalehc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently at a skill of 226.  I have been skilling up on Adamantite, Acrylia and Regent/Sovereign armours.  My main block at the moment is getting hold of temper components, for the Dark elven stuff mainly.<br />
<br />
I will buy essence of shadows for no more that 50pp each.  (yes I know that certain &lt;persons of questionable parentage&gt; are selling thm in /baz at 150pp to 800pp (!!), but it is not worth my time to pay that much).<br />
<br />
In addidition I am making my services available to anyone who can provide me with sufficient raw materials to attempt to make them something, for a very modest fee (which will be dependant on success not the number of attampts).<br />
<br />
I am skilled sufficiently in the other trades to make the tempers myself, should you have the parts required.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
