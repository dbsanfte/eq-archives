<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kirei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i fainally did it, Got 250 Brewing... but now for the Trophy.... I have failed it now 4 times... I would like to know. Since the inception of the new UI has any one completed the trophy? and if so what is the Triv on it?<br />
<br />
I have a 275 int and a brewing geerlock.... Any info would be helpfull....<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>trelos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did my trophy last night on first attempt. <br />
<br />
no message other than I had successfully created it.. and I checked and it  wasn't listed in my known recipes...<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
My advice is not to do your Trophy combine in the PoK barrel it's evil I tell you.. in fact all the PoK TS containers are evil.. I did my in Felwithe down in the dark basement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd be surprised if the trophy was learnable. Why would you want to make it more than once? (I can guess, but don't want to think about it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>HalfNotez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I failed the final combine in the PoK brew barrel - twice.<br />
<br />
I finally made it from the FV brew barrel.<br />
<br />
I dont know where you are making the final combine - but I'am avoiding  PoK for any &quot;big&quot; combines anymore....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>trelos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've failed way too many really important things (multiple times) in the PoK containers..<br />
<br />
I seriously think they are cursed..<br />
<br />
Any major combine I do in Felwithe (simply since it's my home town) now as long as it doesn't have to be done in a PoK one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jago668</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, PoK barrels are cursed.  It took me like 4, or was it 5 attempts to get my trophy.  (too long ago to remember accurately)<br />
<br />
I think when my monk goes for his baking trophy he'll do the combine in cabilis.  I think I'll sacrifice a froglok and a halfling to Cazic-Thule before the combine as well.  Just to be on the safe side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It took me 3 tries to get my brewing trophy.  The 1st attempt was in the PoK.  The 2nd was in West Freeport.  The 3rd and successful attempt was in the PoK.<br />
<br />
Don't think there is a curse, it just your friendly Random Number Degenerator at work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">made my trophy at 248 skill and 272 wis last night in the abysmal sea. first try, success.<br />
<br />
still a tradeskill newbie, but trying to get up there ;)<br />
248 brewing + trophy<br />
191 baking<br />
+ some lower skills<br />
<br />
200 drunkard tho! :angel:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kirei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well i did it, i got my trophy. After SEVEN attempts... I think the reason i was failing is due tot he fact that I was using my geerlock. I decided that after sooo many failes that I would go with only kei and my 275 int... i did mine in thurgadin... Thanks for all your help and if guys... I will look tonight to see if the trophy is in my recipies... and let you know if there is a Triv...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>iikarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">0 for 3 in POk with old UI<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Libbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I made mine on the first try in the Ak'Anon brew barrel.  It's where I had brewed from the 180s all the way to 248, so I thought it was a good place to cap it off with a trophy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lorinah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am currently working on my brewing skill. I have it up to 218 atm. I am curious as to when i should try to make the trophey. I see people waited till about 240+. Any help appreciated</div></div><hr />

How'd you use the new UI if the trophy isn't learned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>trelos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I believe they meant since the new UI has been in place, not done with the new UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pantheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just got 250 today and also did the combine for my Trophy as well. I used the brewbarrel in &quot;experiment mode&quot; to do the combine. Was sweating bullets as I did the combine. I think rng is just being rude to you.<br />
<br />
Being a Kitty I did it in my hometown of Shar Vahl. 1 for 1 till I get the willpower to tackle another skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ssyruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got mine today at the POK barrel with a skill of 248 + Geerlok.  Looks like I ducked the curse :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Rivervale has the best brew barrel :) 1 trophy in 1 try</div></div><hr />
