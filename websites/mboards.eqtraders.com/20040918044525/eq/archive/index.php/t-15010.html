WTF#122.<br />
<br />
Frame#2 - the female gnome monk has always had black hair, but I'm assuming due to the spells going around, her hair is not a bright orange / red.<br />
<br />
Any anime fans reconize her?<br />
<br />
She looks a lot like Washu from Tenchi Muyo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">washu &gt; corrupted monkly gnome. <br />
<br />
sides, monkly gnome chick hasn't genetically engineered any kick-your-ass-then-fall-in-love-with-the-hero super-daughters yet. <br />
<br />
and I doubt that if WTF were animated, she'd have quite that cool of a voice. ^_^ <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
... so, I promise I don't have crushes on cartoon characters (*cough*exceptinuyashaandnaruto*cough*), but does anyone else thing Smoke = teh sexxor when he looks over his glasses like that? ^_^<br />
<br />
I date a nerd/geek, don't I? ^_^ that I like glasses, heh. :cool:<br />
<br />
mmmmmmmm i love wtf ^_^<br />

<br />
No, no wild hair, but the tied back part, andit's not the same shade (Washu's was pink), but pretty close.  I wasm mainly looking at the front hair style and facial expressions.<br />
<br />
BTW - has anyone seen the Tenchi Muyo video someone did for 'She Blinded me with Science&quot;?<br />
<br />
Pretty funny, I'll see if I have room on my webspace and post it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK, it's too big for my webspace.<br />
<br />
Anyone want to host it?<br />
<br />
It's 45MB large, so if I email it to you, dialup will take forever and two days to download.  :)</div></div><hr />

I'm a geek, but I don't wear glasses.  :(<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll just buy some non-correcting glasses.  :)<br />
<br />
(Shh, don't tell the wife!)  :D ;) :cool:</div></div><hr />

I have seen the Muyo &quot;Science&quot; amv. It is... amusing, yes. I dunno, maybe because Muyo was over-ran on CN, and then phazed out with the *erm* sub-par sequals, I haven't seen many outstanding Muyo amvs lately. <br />
<br />
Can't beat the unholy plethora of Kenshin - Creed amvs. o_0  I don't even look for Kenshin amvs anymore, and sadly enough, not Inuyasha ones either; too many that aren't worth my bandwidth to download. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as distroing amvs, they are parodies/humor and therefore legal, so check online and see if anyone is distroing through a website or IRC... I doubt amvs are fast fare enough for torrents. <br />
<br />
<br />
Inc thread hijack... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Excellent AMVs to keep an eye out for: <br />
<br />
-- Memories - &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;. It's a rock/techno remix of the song, excellently set to the haunting Memories short film. <br />
<br />
-- Cowboy Bebop &quot;Failed Experiments in Video Editing&quot;. One girl's story of trying to create the bestest AMV ever.... <br />
<br />
-- Cowboy Bebop - Verve's &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;. Might not last the test of time, but is pretty cool. <br />
<br />
-- &quot;Everybody's Free To Watch Anime&quot;. Misc clips from everything from Muyo/Hina/Ah-Megamisama to Excel to Clamp's X to Battle Angel Alita to Eva... yeah. Mostly pre-1994 stuff. ^_^ Set to the Sunscreen Song. <br />
<br />
-- &quot;Flowers of Love&quot;. Series: Utena. Song: &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot; as redone by a male punk-rock band. As much loathing as I possess for the original female singer of that song, this AMV kicks much, much booty. (The editing = excellent.)<br />
<br />
-- &quot;Lostboy - RhythmAnimation&quot;. High-density in-your-face on-crack clips and music. Good for those late night papers when you need a visual pick-me-up.<br />
<br />
-- &quot;Lord of the Animes: Fellowship of the Animes&quot;. Someone had guts to cast Goku(?) as Frodo. Very amusing. <br />
<br />
-- MQP - &quot;Hair&quot;. Misc clips, extolling the virtues of Anime Hair. Fun to try to recognize all the series represented. <br />
<br />
-- &quot;Nadesico vs Eva&quot;. Nadesico is Eva, minus the Insane Crack. The AMV points out the visual similarities between the two series. <br />
<br />
-- Eva: Rammstein's &quot;Engel&quot;. For a long while, THE best amv there was. Even now, simply excellent. <br />
<br />
-- Trigun and Cowboy Bebop &quot;Tainted Donuts&quot;, to Shakkazombie's &quot;Shiroi Yami no Naka&quot;. SIMPLY. FRIGGING. HILARIOUS. And the song is so addictive too. ^_^<br />
<br />
-- Van Halen's &quot;Right Now&quot; with misc clips. Highly recommended, very funny. Also fun to try to name all the series in there. <br />
<br />
-- YCSTR - &quot;Eva-Man&quot;. Takes the theatrical trailer to Spiderman and sets Eva and LoveHina to it. One of my current favorites. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
... I need to hunt down Naruto amvs ^_^!!! /evilgrin. <br />
<br />
<br />
-- Sanna<br />
no, I don't want too much anime... never such a thing as too much anime...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Minta Rose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You forgot Star Trekkin with clips from Martian Successor Nadeisco--be advised to turn off your reason beforehand.<br />
<br />
Tainted Donuts is my favorite just for the astounding quality of the edits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahh, Sanna you are truely a kindred spirit. I have all the videos you listed :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have &quot;Chibi things that kill&quot; on there.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">on the subject of AMVs, a guildmate has done a couple but of course I can't find his webpage link. One I know of is for Disturbed - Down With the Sickness , and I think Tenchi was the anime<br />
<br />
I've got one for System of a Down's Chop Suey (but I don't know the anime for that one)<br />
<br />
I also have somewhere a Daft Punk - Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.. no clue who did it or where it came from or even what anime it is LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not an AMV, that's an actual anime musical (sort of) done in conjunction with Daft Punk. It's called Interstella 5555 or something like that - it's what the music videos for the last Daft Punk album were taken from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ooh.... hast thou more? We have finished all our series we were watching in club this year, and still have 3 more weeks that need filler content... thus, I need to hunt down more quality amvs... <br />
