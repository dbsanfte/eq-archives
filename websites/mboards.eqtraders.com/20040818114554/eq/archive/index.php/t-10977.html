<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">my pottery is 148 currently and i want to get my pottery to 220. <br />
<br />
what is the best way to do this? i have read that making vials have a better skill up then casserole dishes. is this true?<br />
<br />
what did other successful potters do to skill up? any advice would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made vials of various types until trivial, then made those stupid casserole dishes to 199, then Opal Encrusted Steins to 208, have not gone further than that yet, but am going to take a look at the planar steins instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i got my skill to 188 before starting the advanced vials and casserole dishes. i know i made a few hundread combines before getting over 191. after tht i got 3 more points wiht 100 combines i think. i put my rant on here somewhere.  now someone mentioned the planar steins. i got the information and i'll pout ehre so you dont' ahve to look for the otehr thread.<br />
<br />
tainted planar essence   6.299<br />

                                     ----------<br />
                                      30.550<br />
<br />
now take out the store bought crystal and essence and its roughly 11p cheaper. the bad thing is merchants will NOT buy unfired nor fired steins. that means you ahve to sell to guildies or in the baz which is flodded with them. the upside is that the planar peridot is sued for a PoP quest, the planar travelers manuel. i'm still debateing what to do after the dishes are triv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bearcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Planar steins are actually far cheaper than 30.550 if you are looking strictly at increasing your skill because it is the unfired stein that only uses essence, clay, sketch and water that trivs at 216.  This brings the total cost down to right around 18pp, which isn't too shabby for a post 200 triv combine.<br />
<br />
If you have a decent JC skill I would recommend doing the opal encrusted steins after the planar steins (or even mixed in should you run out of essence in PoK) as I noticed an excellent skill up rate on them.  I went from 214 to 222 on opal steins in around 13 stacks of combines at wis 255.  The opal steins only cost 1pp more but have a sellback of 3pp and change as opposed to the planar steins.<br />
<br />
Getting to 220 is relatively cheap and easy even if you don't have a chanter.  Post 222 is where you either pay through the nose for vials and star rubies, or PL a chanter to 29:mad: <br />
<br />
As for getting from 148 to 199 there are 2 ways you can go about it.<br />
<br />
Casserole dishes are a much more skill up friendly route now that the ceramic linings stack.  So if you don't mind making up stacks of the linings it can be very easy to load up on sketches JPF and then sit in front of a wheel for a couple hours.<br />
<br />
If you prefer to save your wrists the trouble you can go the lined/sealed poison vial route to 188 and then do the casserole dishes for only the last 11 points.  This is also a very cheap route since the lined/sealed vials sell back for over a plat each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>trilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well the biggest thing with the vials are the pelts that are required.<br />
<br />
i guess the casserole dishes are completely store bought?<br />
<br />
anyhow... some happy news, baking 250 and brewing 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sadonumspa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you surf the bazaar at various times during the day, you will find Zombie skins for sale for anywhere from 1-5pp each and lots of them.  I found that to be the quickest and easiest way to 188. From there Casserole Dishes or the Planar Stiens as the recipe items are pretty much Merchant bought.<br />
<br />
Good luck. I have to get Smithing to 227 before I start on Post 200 Pottery.<br />
<br />
You can basically get Pottery to 216 (about 17pp per attempt) without the help of an enchanter, but beyond that, you must have a chanters help to make some piece of each recipe (someone correct me if i'm wrong pls)<br />
<br />
217-222: Unfired Opal Encrusted Stein : 20pp<br />
223-231: White Ceramic Band : 30pp<br />
232-242: Unfired Red Ceramic Band : 65pp<br />
243-250: Unfired Star-Ruby Encrusted Stein : 70pp <br />
<br />
If anyone has a better, less expensive, or less enchanter reliant means to 250, please let me know. Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">zombie skins also tend to be found in abundance in gunthak, neriak, east commonlands, and gukta, as well as the 'new' merchants in nektulos and innothule<br />
or, you could farm 'em yourself, with unrest being the most suggested option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">236 - Crucible Of Escape - less than 10pp per combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if you can't stand farming any pelts/skins yourself, its a good thing you aren't tailoring.  i just raising pottery for the shawl quests atm.  i can do it vendor easy with medium bowls.  large bowls jump price up to much.  time to use those froglock tad skins.  i heard they work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>trilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i am doing all my skills to 220. i want that awesome earring for my rogue.<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Where are you getting the Tainted Planar Essences from for 6pp ? I never see these for sale in the Bazaar and just wound up getting them from guildies exp'ing.<br />
<br />
Trilla, tailoring and smithing are going to be the painful parts of your tradeskills judging by your sig. Both require lots of farming and/or lots of plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Where are you getting the Tainted Planar Essences from for 6pp ? <br />
<br />
From NPC Vendors.  <br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh nice, any suggestions on which vendors to look ? I tried all the ones in the Eastern trading building but no luck yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">With the vendor diving nerf, they are harder to find, but, basically check PoK and PoT vendors for them.  You will get lucky sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Try *all* over.  Don't forget Wayfarer camps.  Bad thing is the Planar Essence are not limited to one type/set of vendors, so it can populate on *any* vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>trilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">aye. im not looking forward to tailoring or smithing.<br />
<br />
im slowly gathering hides for tailoring. only have 125 so far, i figure ill need a bit over 1000 more to make it to 220.<br />
<br />
im thinking once i have 199 pottery, im going to do a ton of hunting in ldon for smithing components, money and aas.<br />
<br />
im very pleased with how my progress is coming along. thanks so much for all the help and advice. im always open for more since i think this will take me several months to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Honestly, I'd hunt in CoD for pottery supplies. The tainted planar essence drop alot in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">PoT and PoK are the only places I look. When I decide to mine the merchnts I hit every merchant in the zone. i also realized it isn't nreally worth getting them since you almost never fail and can't sell them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Since I do farming for so many other trade skills, I made casserole dishes instead of vials since everything I needed for the dishes were vendor bought.  They were a pain, but still a lot faster than farming and cheaper than buying zombie skins in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
Unless money isn’t an issue, I’d suggest making Unfired Crucibles Of Escape from 199 to 220.  You’ll have to farm the heavy clay from Muddites in Gorge of King Xorbb, but when I did it I found there were plenty of mobs to hunt and the drop rate, while not incredible, wasn’t bad.  I’d get about a stack of clay per hour.  And in spite of its name, heavy clay only weight 0.1 per stack.</div></div><hr />
