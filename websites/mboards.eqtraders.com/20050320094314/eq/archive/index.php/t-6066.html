If you have been following Allah and his fight to get his new daughter then you know he did get her (YAY!) and he posted some picks of her, himself and his wife. That got me to thinking, is there any chance you can post some picks of yourself and the great House Orge? I don't know your feeling on having that out there but if your ok with it it's nice to have a little &quot;Human (Halfling maybe)&quot; touch to the name. Just a little request. Have a great day.  :D<br />
