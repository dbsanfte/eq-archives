<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious if anyone knows of certain zones and which type of Bears drop higher rates of High Quality Bear Skins. it is even hard to find large numbers of these for sale in bazaar so I want to Farm them on my own. I recall years ago as a newbie killing tons of Bears in East and West Commons for experience and never getting a HQ Bear Skin.<br />
Anyone know of good places?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rendlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless they have increased the drop rate, you would probably be better off killing rockhoppers on the moon for HQ rockhopper hides (that is if you are making backpacks).<br />
<br />
However, if you want bear, I'd suggest Rathe mountains.  Lots of bears past the cyclops area near the Lake Rathe zone and usually no one hunting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a bear cave in Nedaria’s Landing.  The nice thing about all mobs in Nedaria’s is that any pelts dropped will always be Quality (Low, Medium or High)…never damaged/ruined/tattered.<br />
<br />
Jagged Pines is supposed to be good but you have to dodge the rangers I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cool....is this cave near the docks or near the Magus when you port in? Any faction hits for killing these bears?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The cave is on the zone wall, near the smithy.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are no faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>arturio emerys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In Jagged Pine Forest there are poachers near the river.  There are 3 tents with I believe 18 spawns in them and near them.  They are quaddable in the high 40s low 50s for decent exp.  Mages, necros and bards can farm them well too.  The poachers can drop low, medium and high quality bear, wolf and cat hides and relatively frequently.  They also drop other sellable loot and up to 3 or 4 plat at a time.  These are a good source of cash, tradeskill drops and exp if you are in the high 40s, low 50s.  By 52 the exp will be slower than other places  though.<br />
<br />
If you hunt in Jagged Pine, do not kill the bears, wolves or cats in the zones for tradeskill drops.  They give several nasty faction hits, some that with the fort folks.  It is easy to get kos with the fort folks, which is fixable, but the animals themselves in Jagged Pine do have a faction hit that you recieve for killing them and there is no way to improve that faction.  Most people are kos to that faction starting out, but since you are Druid (I see Tejaye on EqDruids all the time) you won't be kos unless you have already trashed it by killing the animals in Jagged Pine.  No reason to trash a faction when there is an easy alternative.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Awsome thank you.....yes I am a druid :)<br />
I got bored with levelling grind so I took up tradeskills :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't forget that you can also upgrade low &amp; medium quality pelts to high quality via one of the Gukta quests. I don't recall who it is with, but you turn in three of one type and get one of the next higher. Before you ask, no, this does not work to make High Quality Lion Pelts :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The forager there will make the exchange, he's found right next to the soulbinder at the entrance of Gukta. He sometimes goes out foraging though (****, why can't I hire this guy?) and isn't at his spot all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What is the name of this NPC? Forager?<br />
Is he a frog?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, two spots I like are:<br />
<br />
1) west commons (all bears there can drop, black, young kodiak, kodiak) - course I also forage plains roots while there, for cultural robes.<br />
<br />
2) rathe mountains. Near the zone from lake rathe, there are TONS of bears.<br />
<br />
I like these spots, because usually, there is no competition for spawns. If you aren't getting enough bears, round up all the other wandering mobs (snakes, spiders, ect), and earthquake them. They all seem to be PH for bears.</div></div><hr />
