the bank in PoK and the bank at the bazaar<br />
<br />
the Annoying_begger_01 asks YOU for plat!<br />
the Annoying_begger_02 asks YOU for a weapon!<br />
the Annoying_begger_03 asks YOU for armor!<br />
the Annoying_begger_04 asks YOU for more plat!<br />
<br />
ouch *escapes from bank,  camps to hide from them*<br />
I was pretty annoyed and the poster of the forum showed me this which cheered me up immediately<br />

Line 4 suggests that in line one, you replied by giving the beggar some plat.<br />

Please don't feed the beggars, it only encourages them.<br />

My standard response to beggars is first to tell them no to the free cash/weapons/whatever. Then I will offer them a port to feerott, or any other spiderling infested zone, and tell them I will pay them 30pp a stack for spiderling silks. Most of them move on to the next person, seeking a sucker, but occasionally, I save someone from the beggar's life this way.</div></div><hr />

If I am in a city, such as Kaladim, I go anon and do a /who. If any low levels show up, I try to avoid them as best as possible. If, unfortunately, I am not quite so lucky, and he/she is level three or below, I will inspect. If I am satisfied that the beggar is not a twink, I will give 5pp and explain that it is more than enough to buy entry level spells, leather armor, etc., and that I have no items to give away. (Which is usually true.) Then, I say that is all and go back to whatever I am doing. It may be appeasement, but 5pp is a small price to pay for peace and quiet. <br />

Line four suggests that a different beggar (beggar_04 not beggar_01) asks for a greater amount of plat than the first one asked for.<br />
That how I read it...</div></div><hr />

Oddly, I've yet to have a single positive response. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, that is PERFECT.<br />
<br />
line 1: /pause 20, /reply begging is a skill that only works on NPCs<br />
line 2: /pause 20, /reply I will buy celestial essence from you though.<br />
line 3: /pause 20, /reply you can buy all the components in Plane of Knowledge.<br />
line 4: /pause 20, /reply I will pay you MY cost (lowest cost) plus 2 plat for a stack of 20.<br />
line 5: /pause 20, /reply GREAT deal for you, it's a no fail combine and I pay you for your time.<br />
<br />
(don't know why but with less than 20 pause, and not having pause on each line messes it up, but I've tested it out it works.... now just have to wait to try it on a begger ;)</div></div><hr />
