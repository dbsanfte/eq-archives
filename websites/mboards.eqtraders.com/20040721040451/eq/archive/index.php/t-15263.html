<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jylarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm putting my money on all of the stats being rolled up in a text cell or something... but hey, why not check.  Are the stats for food actually values in each SQL table row?  Point being, at certain times during certain fights I would love to be able to do a quick search for magic or poison resist food and tweak myself out a little more with a homebaked meal.  This a possibility by chance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqNichola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fairly sure that at this site the effects are stored en bloc so are not searchable, and it would be a considerable effort to alter things to make them so.<br />

Allakhazam's Item Search provides an answer, though I am not sure if this is only available to premium users. For example, this search (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?classes=0&amp;race=0&amp;type=Inventory&amp;effect=9999&amp;fzone=0&amp;foodtype=1&amp;smod=0&amp;stype=0&amp;stat1=svmag&amp;statlim1=1&amp;stat2=None&amp;statlim2=0&amp;stat3=None&amp;statlim3=0&amp;pristat=svmag&amp;priwt=1&amp;secstat=none&amp;secwt=1&amp;tristat=none&amp;triwt=0&amp;level=&amp;price=&amp;qt=b&amp;aug=y&amp;st=) returns all Food/Drink items with a minimum MR of 1, ordered by MR (the former check is needed to avoid *all* food/drink items being returned).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually I'm not so sure about that.  The way the item descriptions are laid out leads me to think that the values are stored individually.  The layout of the item stats and the standardized form in which they're presented, without a single exception across all items, makes it far too unlikely that they are typed in manually.  It's much more likely that the database has each stat stored separately.<br />

Ngreth has stated before that more detailed search options (which is basically what's being asked for) would take too long to program and probably add a heavier burden on the server.  I don't know if this has changed in the last six months or so (when I last remember him mentioning it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Note to self: research before posting.<br />

The EQTraders advanced search can already do this.  The page is a bit crowded, but the search options are already there.  From the home page, click on Search, then Advanced Search.  Under &quot;Food or Drink&quot;, select Food.  In the &quot;svPoison&quot; field, enter 1.  Then click Find.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, me too :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jylarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wtf?  Advanced search?  How could I use a site for so long and not notice something like this...  Course I am the same high elf that didn't realize there was a Southern Felwithe until level 40 =/</div></div><hr />
