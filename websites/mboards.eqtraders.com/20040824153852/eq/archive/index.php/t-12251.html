<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can find tons of Mammoth in Eastern Wastes.  Just realize that they are stronger and that EW is a significantly more dangerous level than Everfrost.  Tougher, but the Mammoth population is healthy there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Save your fruits and especially vegetables for Misty Thicket Picnics... you will eventually want to switch from Halas Meat Pies to picnics somewhere in the low 200s.  You'll have to farm brownie parts for those... but one brownie part per 100 combines means you won't need many of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>xicrenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks  for yalls input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ungh, I moved off HMP after about 400 combines and 3 skillups. Moved to MTP just because I can get 1000 combines worht of MTP ready for half hte clicks for 400 HMP. Besdies that, I've done voer 4000 MTP to date on a baker mule, and I've spent less than 1k on her. Of course, if I were to sell some of the picnics, I could keep making them for life...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xicrenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well tried  MTP tonite <br />
did 50 combines got 2 skillups to 200 ( yeah) but only got 3 successful combines 12 MTPs<br />
<br />
i even had that geelok thing for baking<br />
<br />
am i just to early?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">MTP's are trivial over 250, so your success rate is going to be low at LEAST into the 220's. It won't be great at 250! :) <br />
<br />
Seriously though, it cost so much less to do MTP's that I'd recommend you stick with them anyway. And since you have a 65 necro, save the meats you get up in PoP. A LOT of them have recipe's trivial above 250, so that can be another source of skill ups.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, Vann toes are great post 200 route. Very easy to get in quantity if you raid BoT, and drop often enough with jord meat in xp groups to be worth your while. I can pull 20 combines per hour of grouping in BoT with a few friends, and getting xp. Seems a good deal to me.</div></div><hr />
