<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You, in the SUV. You, in the big Pickup Truck.  Get out of the handicapped space.<br />
<br />
I don't care if it's &quot;Just for a minute&quot; while you drop off movies at blockbuster, or return something to the grocery store, or wait for your friend at MCDonalds.<br />
<br />
THE HANDICAPPED SPACE IS NOT THERE TO SAVE YOUR LAZY REAR 2 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE.<br />
<br />
The ONLY people who should *EVER* be parked in a handicapped space should be people with the little sticker or hangtag on their car.    Or, in rare cases, people experiencing a medical *emergency*.   If someone's son cuts himself open on something, or accidently breaks his arm, by all means they should park the car there while they get him some help.<br />
<br />
And don't block the handicapped space , either.    It's no better to park your car horizontally across the area in front of the handicapped space than it is to occupy iy.<br />
<br />
I don't care if the car is still running, idling, or if you left your (non-handicapped) great aunt Clara in the car, and you dont consider that to be &quot;Parking&quot;.  If any part of your car is making it impossible for a real , honest to Innoruuk, Handicapped person to park there, I have words for you.  Words that I can't say here.<br />
<br />
I swear to God, one day, I will become a cop so I can ticket each and every single person who does this. I'll sit in front of blockbusters, fast food places, and WalMarts, and try to teach people that you CAN NOT be a lazy jerk at the expense of the disabled.   And I will show up,with photographic proof, for every single person who takes the ticket to court. <br />

My wife has 2 prosthetic hips (2 total hip replacements) and has arthritis with them.  We even have a service dog who helps her walk (as a mobile crutch) when she needs it, yet she &quot;doesn't qualify&quot; for a handicapped sticker.<br />
<br />
(Although I am pretty sure that if she even did she wouldn't park in them because &quot;Other people need it more then she does&quot; (according to her)).<br />

(Funny story, there was a fire when someone parked in the fire lane, the truck came, the car was still there, let's just say they moved the car, the owner of the car tried to sue the fire dept, and the judge (who was retired FD) threw the case out stating that he was illegally parked and parked there at his own risk), even the country judge stood by that.</div></div><hr />

Fire lanes are different.  They're posted for the *offenders* safety, more than anything else.  If you're in a place a truck wants to park, they'll &quot;move&quot; you, as you said.  If you're in front of a hydrant, you'll find that the fire department has creative ways of getting a hose where they want it to go.<br />

It's just a durn shame that the handicapped don't have similar resources at their disposal.</div></div><hr />

Remember the opening of the movie &quot;Backdraft&quot;?  The firetruck arrived and the firemen looked for the hydrant... and found it directly next to a Mercedes (maybe BMW... but you get the idea... expensive car)... and the way it was &quot;creatively&quot; solved the problem, was to take the fire-axe and smash the driver and front passenger windows, feeding the hose directly through them.<br />
<br />
They didn't even need to depict the driver returning to the car and not being able to leave...</div></div><hr />

His campaign to assist in enforcement was simple -- if he saw a vehicle in a handicapped spot that should not be, he let the air out of the tires and left a note.  I'm sure he could have been cited for that himself, but most cops tended to look the other way.  No permanent damage done, but a reminder given. :)</div></div><hr />

Are you sure?  I'm pretty sure that use of a legal handicapped tag by a non-handicapped person is just as illegal, if not more, as not having the tag and parking there in the first place.  Maybe it's on a state-by-state basis?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, every now and then I see people who aren't really handicapped parking in handicapped spots with proper stickers. and it kind of irks me.  I ca't say anything , because they might have some kind of &quot;Secret&quot; handicap.     But seeing some 18 year old couple park in a handicapped spot at work, and then run and skip into the store laughing and giggling makes me think that perhaps they're using Mommy or Daddy's sticker.     But who knows?<br />
<br />
Years ago, My father wasn't disabled.    My mother has been for many many years.    We always had a handicapped sticker growing up, but if my mother wasn't in the car, My Father wouldn't park in a handicapped space. <br />
<br />
I guess I was just raised like that.   We weren't handicapped, so our car didn't go near the space.   <br />
<br />
As an side note, we have one or two customers at work that I see on a semi-regular basis that inspire me.    One is walking with a cane, and is obviously having serious medical difficuties.   And I've yet to see him park in the handicapped spaces.   And then there's the man who is in a wheelchair who drives himself, has a folded up/disassembled wheel chair in the back seat of his car.  Parks in the disabled spot, gets his wheelchair from the backseat, assembles it himself, and slides himself into it.  Never asks for help from anyone, even though we always offer and do what we can.   If I ever see him pull in, and someone's illegaly parked in the handicapped space, I'm going to FIND THEM inside, and make them move.  Probably after I call the cops.<br />
<br />
<br />
And , in regard to Nhin's comment about making people disabled,  I have to bite my tongue a hundred times a day.  I've decided that threatening to make people disabled isn't in my best interest, whether at work or at play.  But I always wonder if hoping that they find out how difficult it is to be handicapped isn't in their future.<br />

<br />
Actually, there are two types of tags given out, temporary and permanent (in the states that issue special plates for it, the plates are only given for a permanent one). Not everyone who is entitled to a disabled parking space is that way because they use a wheelchair or walk in an obviously different way all the time. In fact, like my grandmother, they may be walking briskly INTO that store, and then limping back out 20 minutes later when the pain catches up with them. (She thinks just because her knees are only 10 years old, that they should be in better shape than the rest of her.)  Other people have back conditions or heart conditions that aren't immediately apparent.<br />
<br />
 Think pimp-mobile with custom rims ... <br />
Just because you're disabled doesn't mean you can't drive an expensive car.   A personal friend of mine races a Ferrari for a living-- with custom-built hand controls.  Her website has some pretty cool pics, but since it's advertising the race team, I won't link it here (but you can PM me if you want to see it.)<br />
<br />
Anyways, usually the best thing to do if you see someone suspiciously able-bodied parking in the wrong spot is to approach them and brightly say &quot;Oh, look! You forgot your little hang tag! Better go get that out, huh?&quot;  rather than making assumptions about someone's physical state. <br />

<br />
Mom drives Grandmom's car, now that i have the van... if Grandmom is there (and she does like to get out of the house and go shopping ^_^), she uses the tag... if it's just her, tag goes in glovebox. <br />

Last summer, the police set up a undercover officer there, who wrote 63 tickets in an eight hour period.<br />
<br />
A week later, they set up the same operation. This time, they wrote 54 tickets and towed 18 vehicles.<br />
<br />
A week after that, they wrote 49 tickets, and towed 14 cars, including a city councilman's car.<br />
<br />
The whole operation was cancelled for some &quot;unknown&quot; reason right after that city councilman's car was towed.</div></div><hr />

That sickens me.  I'm a councilman, so I'm allowed to do whatever I want.  :grumpy:  :irked: <br />
<br />
Honestly, these people who park in the spaces and don't need to are taking their good health for granted.<br />
<br />
Maybe courts should make them 'handicapped' for a week. I'm not talking about injuring them, but maybe putting a type of cast on their leg, immobilizing it, or something on that lines, so they can see the inconvenience that they're giving others.<br />
<br />
(Honestly, that really wouldn't work too well most likely, since the people doing this are usualy either ignorant or arrogant, neither of which like to learn lessons).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My father is handicapped.<br />
The state of NJ only allows one permanent (license plate) and one temporary (hangy card) per household.<br />
<br />
I generally am the one who drives my dad around, in the car without the plates.<br />
When we do go out, we park in the handicapped spots.<br />
Occasionally, he'll start to get out of the car, but be too fatigued to enter the store, so he'll get back in.  I go in alone while he waits.<br />
<br />
If I know he's not going in at all, I won't park there.<br />
<br />
If he's not in the car, the tag doesn't leave the glove compartment.  Well unless we're taking him in a different car.<br />
<br />
I do understand the frustration.  Unfortunately, my town does nothing against violators, even when a cop car parks next to them at a convenience store.</div></div><hr />

I am handicapped, broke my back and neck in 3 places. I am incredibly thrilled that I am not a para or quad, though I have good days and bad days. I *generally* park as far away from the entrance as I think I can manage because walking gently is about the only exercise I can do...I am willing to use the permit if it is slushy and slippery and icy out [really don't want to fall and screw up my ability to move...] but prefer to let someone who *really* needs it in good weather and bad to use it.<br />

Though I probably will end up on canes in the next 10 years, and a chair within the decade after that...I will happily slog away from a distance=)</div></div><hr />

The SuperTarget has two entrances and they put all of the handicap spots in the middle rather than by the sets of doors.<br />

Of course, this thread sort of reminds me of an episode of Ally McBeal where a handicap man in a wheelchair is suing for discrimination and Ling (who is pretty much an ice queen) finds out and says, &quot;You guys already get all of the good parking spots, what more do you want!?&quot;<br />

Honestly, I think most of the people here don't care (not in a bad way) where you work.  You have a job, that's a lot more than what a lot of people in this country can say. If they're immature enough to have an attitude like that, then they need to be ignored.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I'd rather have people snickering about where I work instead of what I really get, non-stop questions about their service, complaints, and people demanding I give them free stuff (I'm a tech with a large wireless company, and the wireless industry is the #2 most complained about industry in the US, next to automobiles).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aryse Andenter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Wow you realy hit on one of my rant issues with this one! <br />
<br />
My uncle would never dream of saying anything to anyone, and he hates to take a handicapped space (he somehow always insists other people are even worse off than him) and would never wait for one to open up if it is not available, but the more he walks now the less he will be able to walk in the future as it agravates his problems and has permanent debilitative effects. <br />
<br />
Seeing him hobbling to the store from a few rows over and knowing that this means he will have to go home and remain seated for the rest of the day sure brings out the anger towards the irresponsible driver who wanted to save himself a few minutes. What about the hours of my uncle's time he has now wasted? Not to mention the possible permanent damage his thoughtless action caused? *Grrr*<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note though, I do know two people without visible disabilities who both have valid reasons for having the handicapped parking pass. I'll focus on the folks with no pass at all and have faith that the apparently able bodied teen running into the store has a serious but less visible condition and that she is thankful she can run into the store every day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I debated whether I would post in this topic (and I guess I won, or lost ;p)  <br />
<br />
While I appreciate how far we've come when it comes to accessability, I fear we've taken a giant step back when people are so upset that the first spaces are set aside for those that need and will benefit from them, that they need to police the users.  <br />
<br />
My mom uses a wheelchair full time now and she isn't able to drive anymore. She needs assistance from the truck to her wheelchar.  I drive an SuV... mainly because I like them but a prime consideration was that it had to be comfortable enough for my mom if she didn't want to get out And still have room for the chair And any shopping we do. <br />
<br />
Before she stopped driving she had perma-handicapped plates, once she couldn't drive we turned them in. She also had a tag if she was in another car. <br />
<br />
She would push me all the time to hang that **** tag in my truck and use the handicapped spaces at the stores. But to me, it was easier to drop her off at the door and find another space.  It was also a way to serve two people  (in my mind: mom and whoever used the free space). <br />
Even her doctor tried to get me to apply for a tag/plate as I was the sole driver for her. <br />
<br />
Two reasons why I didn't and still haven't gotten that tag:<br />
<br />
First, people who,  god forbid, see my walking back to the truck to set up for mom to get in and feel they need to say something to me....  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Second, in my mind... as long as the store had a flat sidewalk in front, I didn't need a separate space, just 2 minutes in front to unload the wheelchair and mom.  BTW, stores that have raised sidewalks didn't get my $$ when I took mom out ;p<br />
<br />
So, while I understand your ire about cars parked in handicapped spaces without tags (here in NY, I see cars in em lots more than I do trucks ;p)  or with people in it you've determined to be healthy enough not to &quot;need&quot; it, may I suggest that either a report to the local police station or a photo of the car and sign sent in to them will take care of anyone that shouldn't be using the space. <br />
<br />
One last thing, my sister in law is one of those people who doesn't &quot;look&quot; handicapped, but is.  She has been confronted more than once, by some moron that felt the need to berate her about her plate and use of the space. <br />
<br />
Inconsiderate people are the suck... whether they're illegally using a designated space....or deciding who should or shouldn't get to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main beef is the people who park in the spaces who have no decal, or the people who leave their car running across 3 spaces, one of which is handicapped, so they can run into blockbuster or McDonalds, or wait for a buddy they're picking up from work.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">....definitely one of those subjects that can and does get my back up at times and along with a call to a new dentists office had me overreacting just a tad! <br />
------------------<br />
Me: Good Morning, I'd like to schedule an appt. for my mom to see the dentist, but before we start I need to know if it is handicap accessible as she is in a wheelchair. <br />
<br />
Dentist office: Oh yes, you can walk in from the parking lot (poor choice of words, but... okay), no problem at all for a wheelchair (this fixed it). <br />
<br />
Me: That's great. (sets appt.)<br />
<br />
Dentist office: Is your mom able to get out of the wheelchair?<br />
<br />
Me: (pause) well.... I'll be there and can move her to the chair if necessary, but in the past, she has had the work done while sitting in the wheelchair whenever possible as she really isn't very mobile. Why do you ask?<br />
<br />
Dentist office: well, there are 2 small steps to get to the treatment rooms... <br />
<br />
 :faint: <br />
<br />
<br />
This happens quite frequently and it's annoying.  I Am however, greatful that the person I spoke to Did ask... too many times we've gotten to an appt. to find that while the reception area is on the ground floor, the doctor is on a different floor or there are a number of steps to traverse...</div></div><hr />
