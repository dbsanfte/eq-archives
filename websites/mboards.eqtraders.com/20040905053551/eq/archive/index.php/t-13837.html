<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LinaInverse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if this belongs here or Brewing, so I may post in both if I don't get any responses here.<br />
<br />
Most people here are either Master bakers or aspiring to be.  While baking, you get tons of food that you end up eating as you play (you have to eat something while you adventure, after all).  My character ends up eating a lot of Halas pies as I have tons of them while I'm skilling (195 atm).  Satisfies the need and gives some decent stat boosts.<br />
<br />
My question to bakers here is what do you wash that HMP/MTP/whatever down with?  For those who don't pursue Brewing, I guess Fizzlepop 5000 is a popular choice.  But many here also pursue Brewing and those are the ones I'm asking.  You obviously can't use alcoholic drinks, so which do you use?  What non-alcoholic brews are:<br />
1) Fairly easy to make and don't require a lot of farming (vendor bought ingredients)<br />
2) Last a while.<br />
3) Give decent stat bonuses<br />
<br />
Fizzlepop satisfies #1 and 2.  Any thoughts about what I can start brewing to wash my pies down?  My current skill in Brewing is 100, but I plan on drilling it once I get past 226 in Baking (need to make Jum-Jum Beer to finish MTPs anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I make Grobb Liquidised Meat.  I started making them about 165, I think, and the success rate was pretty acceptable.  Yield is 6, I believe (haven't made any in a couple months), so you end up with plenty to drink, and the extras sell well in the Bazaar.  The combines were not too bad pre-UI; I suspect it's a cakewalk now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GLM for melees, QAT for those who need int/wis.<br />
<br />
It's a major pain to get the stuff for them, but they are (so far) the best stat drinks out there.<br />
<br />
What I would like is to be able to brew some fizzlecutter formula 5000 style drink (lots of duration filler drink) with relative ease.  Something like the fish rolls of the brewing comunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With wis and sta maxed, I have no real need for either of the 2 &quot;standard&quot; stat drinks (GLM/QAT), so I've been living off Kaladim Constitutionals for some time.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to see that there are drinks that actually add +hp/mana in GoD (various teas), but the fact that they are only a &quot;drink&quot; and not a higher duration category makes me hesitant to try them out (especially for only 5 hp/mana!).  Maybe the Mountain Teas will be more exciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nirean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok, for my drinks, i use lemonade, whistlewetter, 5 stam 5 agil, 56 brewing trivial, use a lemon, a flask of water, and a cup of sugar in a brewbarrel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use the good old Qenos Afternoon Tea, which is not so bad now that Kings Thorn is available on the  Queen of Thorns (I personally still have a few stacks of tea leaves from farming silks in EK).<br />
<br />
I'm excited to try some of the new teas, but have been having trouble actually getting many tea leaves (ok, so far I've gotten one), and I have yet to hear of anyone getting their hands on Mountain Tea. <br />
<br />
I find this to be really odd, since I have foraged literally 20 stacks of hynid and cragbeast meat, and fishing for half an hour results in like 10 stacks of tuna and crab.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, we're just missing something, and tea will turn out to be a bit more plentiful than it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For my Cleric, I drink Qeynos Afternoon Tea.  Don't really need the +Wis right now (I've got over 260 Wis, but am limited to 255 because of level), but I like the +Dex &amp; +Agl.<br />
<br />
For my Paladin, I drink Surefall Ranger's Trail Juice.  In my opinion, it's the very best drink for Paladins, Rangers &amp; Beastlords.  +4 Sta, +4 Wis, +4 Agl is just sweet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brewing: Chocolate + Milk = .. Chocolate Milk :p<br />
Both bought off baking mercants in Abysmal Sea, with a brew barrel across room.<br />
<br />
This drink goes especially well with muffins :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm...<br />
<br />
My three melee's are eating Halas Pies and drinking Grobb Liquidized Meats.<br />
<br />
My wizard, who is over 255 INT with just his gear eats Van Toe Stew (+45 mana) and drinks Kaladim Constitutionals for the saves.<br />
<br />
My other four casters eat MTP's and drink QaT's for the INT/WIS to get them to 255+.<br />
<br />
I have a 250 brewer, and a 250 baker, so I supply all my own goodies. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nayana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well i usually drink kaladim constitutionals, whole they do require a bit of farming ( actually just picking up ground spawns in kaladim for an hour to get 100 combines worth)  its  not that hard...  even for those KoS in kaladim..<br />
<br />
<br />
and for the high end player who has wisdom ect and all that maxed... resists own everything..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madbakerhobbit2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The things you learn in these boards....<br />
<br />
Today, I learned that Balkin likes toe soup.  That's nasty, Balkin ;)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, Havings Kings thorn on the big boat ROCKS!  I make the Afternoon teas whenever I can lay my hand on the leaves, and the awful little gnome in steamfont just does not want to have friendship time with me.<br />
<br />
Back to topic... Raising your brewing skill has become super easy with the new interface, so you may want to consider taking a couple of hours to get yourself up to Grobb Liquidised Meat level.  They are sort of like your halas pies in that you get a lot of them per combine, so you will not run out while skilling up.<br />
<br />
Constitutionals are one of my favorites in game, but I hate sitting in kaladim waiting on mushrooms.</div></div><hr />
