<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Linea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so today ive finally reached the pinnacle of my career. since the day i made an entire set of silk armor for my wizard, through camping brownies for hours on end, past slogging through shawl quests...<br />
<br />
when they introduced the new recipes to be able to take tradeskills all to 250, then introduced the ability to get AA to get all on one character, i decided that was the course for me. today i finally achieved 1750! and then i realized, now what?!<br />
<br />
taking a look at my bank today, i realized that it will be... difficult... to let some of this stuff go... half a dozen bricks of molten ore... a wind worn stone... stack of spiderling silks... hero parts... i have 5 characters all crammed with various items ive picked up over the years. packratitis is so ingrained in me by now; i mean, really... how much use is ONE shrieking substance? a stack of boning? 3 stacks of tainted planar essence?<br />
<br />
i was so proud of myself the day i gave myself permission to DROP 8 stacks of jumjum spiced beer on the ground, but how do i convince myself to let the rest of it go?<br />
<br />
im quite certain the answer isnt to petition for more bank space, since that would quickly become jammed with junk; but i cant stop myself from buying every quality pelt and semi-usefull meat product i come across at a vendor! <br />
<br />
who else has had this packrat addiction! and what have you done to deal with it? input appreciated!~ LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level up a shaman and to alchemy<br />
Level up a gnome and do tinkering<br />
Level up a rogue and go Poison making.<br />
<br />
After that...<br />
<br />
Hm... im kinda... not doin a lot at the moment since i hit 1750...<br />
<br />
=(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hit 1750 today too, and it feels weird to be without that goal.  I'm at the &quot;what do i do now&quot; phase too and not really sure what to do either... I guess I'll exp now /shrug.  The first thing I did after getting 250 in smithing today was to destroy my leftover owlbear substances... that was wonderful!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stop clicking and go have some fun for a change! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just hit 1750 today.<br />
<br />
Ever since I hit 1764 a few months ago I've been collecting bits and pieces same as always.  It's hard to change that habit (er, packrat addiction).  But now I sell them in bazaar instead of buying in bazaar.  Between the money earned and the money not-spent, it's amazing how much I gain over time.  I have new insight into how my customers were always able to afford my goods.  I tried making some high-end items to sell, but alas the parts sell for more than the results.  Even with 1750, it's still more profitable to not tradeskill.<br />
<br />
I've also gotten to explore a few more zones (where invis still works) with the time I used to spend farming and clicking.  Soloed myself a few nice items in those zones with stats/effects/clicks that no tradeskill items can even come close to.  Sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dumpty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">kill 2 birds and make a gnomish rogue.  i have no interest ever in poison or alchemy, so my new gnome is pally for kicks intead. /tinkering on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What do you do now?<br />
<br />
Share all that hoarded loot!!!!<br />
You have spiderling silks????????<br />
/e contacts a halfling rogue to do some 'covert ops'<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Well done to all of you who have done what many see as impossible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hit 1750 yesterday. What do I do now? Easy... I'm at 249 AA. It'll take me a while to max that out.<br />
<br />
Of course, I've already maxed out every other skill. This includes hand-to-hand (a very useless skill for a druid) begging, all languages etc. Due to game bugs, I'm actually overmaxxed on tracking (182 vs. druid max of 175) and secondary specialization (115 vs. max of 100). Note: don't blame me for the bugs. I just hit the keys. I'm sure that many folks, including myself, have sent in bug reports.<br />
<br />
Obsessive/compulsive... everything... must... be... maxxed... out.<br />
<br />
After 1750 you could always start a petition drive to allow skillups to 300 on all trades... hehe.:p <br />

<br />
me: Hello, my name is Maevennia<br />
<br />
crowd: Hello Maevennia!<br />
<br />
me: I'm here today to admit before you all that I am addicted! &lt;sobs&gt; Yes, I am! I freely admit it, I am a Tradeskill Junkie!  I started slow at first, a few silk swatches here, some banded armor there, but I quickly moved on to the hard stuff.  You know what I'm talking about...padding! &lt;sob&gt; and....and....picnics! I've slaughtered so many bears, wolves and lions that the druids of Jagged Pine consider me public enemy #1, and those poor little brownies run screaming in terror whenever they see me....and I have pelts and silks, glazes, tempers and sundy meats overflowing not only from my bank, but from all of my friends' as well!  Oh, the shame!<br />
<br />
<br />
lol :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that it makes alot of difference, I have no tracking AA's and have noticed my druid tracking going above the old 125 limit lately. I think its up over 150 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yah, it's a bug, however, I believe it's fixed now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow... at this rate, I'm going to feel very un-special when I finally get 1750.  I'm at 226 tailoring now, with the other six at 250.  <br />
<br />
Personally, when I get 1750, I'm going to write a guide on how I did it, what I would change, things I would change if I did it again (/eye roommate's account).  I'd also include favorite hunting spots, methods of farming ingredients, suggestions for fundraising, how to break the monotony, and maybe even a FAQ.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I guess I should get back to farming and buying othmir fur... it seems like the fastest way for tailoring.  (suggestions/advice perpetually welcome)<br />
<br />
Congratulations to all the above &quot;1750 Club&quot; members!<br />
~Healblade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When you reach 1750... <br />
<br />
1. Hold your arms out in front of you.<br />
<br />
2. Slip your hands into the long white sleeves provided.<br />
<br />
3. Allow the nice men to assist you in hugging yourself as a reward for your achievement.<br />
<br />
4. Continue hugging yourself and enjoying your new soft room. ;)</div></div><hr />

Why another account? <br />
<br />
There are plenty more servers. Try going to a fresh server where you don't know anyone and start from scratch.</div></div><hr />
