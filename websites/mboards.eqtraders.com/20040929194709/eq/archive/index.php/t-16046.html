<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aerialle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am working on my Aid Grimel quest and my Tailoring skill just hit 187 a day or two ago. From all of the research that I've done, it seems that the most popular routes to take at this point which are available to me as a Human Monk are:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Acrylia Reinforced (trvial 242)<br />
 Haze Panther (trivial &gt;250)<br />
 Ceremonial Solstice Robes (trivial 335)<br />
 Arctic Wyvern (trivial 335)<br />
<br />
<br />
My confusion is this. How are Solstice Robes and Arctic Wyvern armor considered to be viable skillup paths when there trivials are so high? Admittedly, I haven't tried robes yet but I did try a stack of Arctic Wyvern Masks yesterday just to get an idea and the success rate was horrible. I believe I made 1 mask in 20 attempts.  :grumpy: Am I trying these way too soon or something? Would my rate be any different with robes? Oh, the questions.  :( <br />
<br />
My max Wisdom with tradeskill gear and VoQ is a whopping 251 so I realize I am fighting a somewhat uphill battle. I just want to make sure though that I'm not wasting my money on something that I shouldn't be doing right now.<br />
<br />
Any advice is greatly appreciated!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With the solstice robes you want to fail on them.   they only consume the gem studded chain on a success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Arctic Wyvern is easy to farm at near-EP level (I'm assuming, since you are doing Aid Grimel) and none of the components are rare or uncommon.  All it takes it a little patience and time.<br />
<br />
Solstice Robe components are all store bought (except the silk).  It is relatively cheap ... if you failed the combine, since you get the chain back.<br />
<br />
Panther is hard because the only source of yew leaves is rare forage and you need tracker to farm the skin.<br />
<br />
Acrylia is hard also because there is only one effective camp, in DSP and you need the good hides which don't drop that often.<br />
<br />
This is a case where trivial be dam_ed.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Actually Othmir Fur is even better but most people can't make their own mana vial .... so there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aerialle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ohh, I guess I did not pay enough attention to the recipe to know that the chain is returned upon failure. Now I understand why I have heard some complain about succeeding on them. LOL<br />
<br />
I guess the obvious follow-up question then regarding robes is, do I really want to equip a geerlok for these then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a human, you may also want to look at the LoY robes, since I think any race with int casters got a set.  Depends on how patient (and lucky) you are collecting dye components and research pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I guess the obvious follow-up question then regarding robes is, do I really want to equip a geerlok for these then?<br />
I think the general consensus was, no, don't. But up to you.<br />
<br />
I would suggest working on getting max wisdom as well. Grab some stat food (misty thicket picnic, qeynos tea), something. Every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
If you have LOTS of money, do robes or buy the needed stuff. Otherwise, work on one or another or all of the recipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>astianax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">human loy robes are a pretty good option for you, as heartsong suggested.<br />
one of my guildmates swears by 'em after trying her hands at all the other options.<br />
ribbons all trivial at 187 max, and the robes made with them are as follows:<br />
robe of mana: 212 (needs salil's writ 90 right)<br />
robe of scent: 222 (needs essence of rathe)<br />
robe of concussion: 232 (needs rune of concussion)<br />
robe of lodestone: 242 (needs flake of lodestone)<br />
robe of obliteration: 252 (needs words of obliteration)<br />
robe of capacity: 262 (needs words of capacity)<br />
<br />
<br />
asti</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>papyscott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did the human LoY skill up path and it works great.  It is a very steady way to improve your skill (I am at 234 currently).<br />
<br />
Forget about Salil 90 (212 robe), the one you need is the uncommon one.  In the bazaar or on vendors you can find lots of essence of rathe (222 robe).  Rune of concussion (232 robe) is also very common.  It gets harder after that (flake of loadstone, obliteration, capacity), but by that time you have your skill up to 232.  <br />
<br />
As a nice bonus the robes have very nice tribute value:<br />
<br />
concussion: 180 / robe iirc<br />
loadstone: 1400 / robe<br />
obliteration: 1800 / robe<br />
Capacity:  6000 / robe<br />
<br />
Since I started this approach to tailoring, my tribute has been running steady at around the 200k max lol. (I keep MP4, ER4, FT5, hp150 and mana150 up all the time since I have so many banked robes to tribute $$)<br />
