Dec. 12, 1941: The City Council of Berkeley, Calif. approves, by 5-4, a resolution condemning as &quot;warmongering&quot; the recent U.S. declaration of war on Japan. In a statement, the council deplores &quot;violence as a means of settling international disputes&quot; and urges President Roosevelt to &quot;sit down with the Japanese ambassador in Washington&quot; and &quot;enter into a meaningful, non-gender or race-based dialogue.&quot; <br />
