 Tinkered (re-chargeable) SOW-like device for all/all<br />
 A recepie for a collapseable deluxe size toolbox<br />
 An animated graphic for the Geerlok Clockwork Contraption (like a spinning set of gears or something?)<br />
 Tinkered stat enchancing (rechargeable?) devices for the ammo or charm slot <br />
or<br />
 Tinkered augmentations (re-chargeable?) for armor slots.<br />

Even if we had got maybe 2 or 3 of these wishes with the GOD release I'd be happy....but so far I'm not impressed.  Hopefully we'll see some new recepies soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Me wish List- <br />
  Yo-yo's normal toys, battle yo-yo's (1hb), begemmed yoyo's with effects... (couple pie plates, string, sprockets, dowel, dwarven wire and den add other stuff for fancier versions- simple to make (low tinker needed))<br />
<br />
  Propeller hats/helmets  (levitation device or safefall device) Props, spring (twisted dwarven wire around a dowel and heated in a forge (smithing) , padded cap, iron cap, manabattery) basically a one way levitation - down slowly only...works on small races only...(halfling gnomes and dwarfs)...click effect run and jump...float down spinning slowly while you fall...<br />
<br />
 Ogre-corker cannon...plugs up the ogres so they can't pass wind... ranged item used for pulling, uses corks, soda water, mana battery, spyglass, tube, leather padding...<br />
 Over the shoulder device- fires a cork for long long distance...if it hits target does a low low agro pull...but with ogres causes HIGH agro...if you crit...well...better not go there. :D :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
 Winged Boots- feathers and fletchings, dwarven wire, dwarven springs, sprockets and gears (micro) appropriate boots (plate best), mana battery x 2 (1 each boot), metal sheet (light metal)...<br />
   effect- 5-15% run speed increase  10% leaping distance 15% height on jumps...safe fall if jumping...click and buff lasts 5 minutes, works with sow, but not lev...:angel: <br />
<br />
<br />
 Pie catapult...backpack sized item, uses minicatapult, harness, pie rack, mana battery, gears, dwarven springs, etc ...<br />
 Can hold 10 pies (opens like toolbox) and when clicked will fire a pie at your target...effect would be silly, but would work for pulling...may also use pudding, rat goo, and stale biskits...but pies work best.<br />
 Great for food fights, or to distract hungry gnolls, giants , ogres and trolls...launch a few pies at them and they will fight for the pieces while you run away!<br />
<br />
<br />
Gnomish Drink shaker- caution on putting Fizzlepop inside it!! Or other bubbly drinks...<br />
   Cask (2 slot), Vibrating harness (harness, mana battery, springs gear sprockets and winding handle), metal bits (for mountings- or gnomish bolts) <br />
 When used Gnome or other user clicking it vibrates up and down and in a small circle for a few seconds...result is a well mixed beverage...<br />
  Mixes Fruit smoothies, mixed drinks...<br />
    Fruit smoothy would be Milk + fruit and click...<br />
    Mixed drink would be fruit juice/veggie juice + alcohol of choice and CLICK...<br />
    If fizzy drink is used...aoe stickyness (emote and short buff that makes you stick to things (light snare)...<br />
:boggled: <br />

 Tinkered (re-chargeable) SOW-like device for all/all<br />
<br />
The tinkered devices market already has enough of a detrimental impact on the alchemy market.  You can already make sow effect devices for gnomes, be happy.<br />
<br />
 Tinkered stat enchancing (rechargeable?) devices for the ammo or charm slot <br />
<br />
Again this is trying to take over the alchemy market.<br />
<br />
 Tinkered augmentations (re-chargeable?) for armor slots.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Augments are no drop on all servers other than FV, this doesn't seem like it will be planned to be changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some nice ideas there robsf115.<br />
<br />
Particularly like the idea of a tinkered rechargable SoW item.<br />
<br />
I also feel that gnome int casters are getting the short end of the stick. There are some nice (but not exactly fantastic in the light of the LDoN armour) tinkered armour for the plate wearing classes but us cloth wearers get nothing except a few cultural robes.<br />
<br />
How about the chance to tinker our cultural robes into something better along the lines of the rechargeable stat enhancements given by the clockwork armour. Or add some otehr tinkered cloth items? Maybe add a recharageable mana enhancement or HP regen ability.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>robsf115</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey Tudani - <br />
<br />
This was a for fun wish list for tinkerers, not meant to be some flame target from shaman.   Your precious alchemy market started infringing on the enchanter class with your illusion potions so I dont see why my wish would be that far off the mark.<br />
<br />
As far as the Clockwork Observer armor with sow....that's all fine and dandy and I would be happy if I were a plate wearing class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My post was a critique of the ballance issues involved between tinkering/alchemy and what I see as a good reason to not give such a thing to tinkers.  My post was not a flame, but yours is getting very close to a personal attack.<br />
<br />
Illusion potions - enchanters can't sell illusions so it didn't impact any market, and I never asked for them to be given to alchemists.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see some more creative ideas from the tinker community than alchemy potions on a rechargeable item.  I've seen some great ones in the past, and even on this thread.  There's a lot more cool things that could be done with tinkering, and imo my tinker would prefer to make those than a rechargeable form of a shaman potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>robsf115</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry but I just have to laugh at you and your concern about &quot;balance&quot;!  The alchemy trade has got to be the biggest monopoly of stat enchancing class crossing trade ever given to the shaman class.  There's a potion for everything imaginable and available to everyone who desires them.  You can even get added mana and fizzle control potions (another class crossing specialized skill to help with your sales).  And it continues with every expansion.  Every item you create there is a market for.  Yet those of us who tinker (one of the most expensive trade skills available) don't see much of a return on anything until maybe geerlok level.  And even then it's lucritive at best.  <br />
<br />
Correct me if Im wrong, but I count 14 new alchemy recepies with the latest expansion.  And judging by the names ...even more class crossing detrimental effects with these items.  IE:  Ensnaring / stunning etc.  So far all we have are mana batteries, how's that for &quot;Balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
So let's not talk about balance ok?  Your trade is way out of wack as it is.  Even if by some miracle we were to get some sort of tinkered sow item.  I doubt it would impact your market much if at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Errrr........ Yes we can :D<br />
<br />
With AA ability we can cast an illusion on another player, but you're right, there has never been much of a market for that.<br />
<br />
Now can we all calm down and remember that this is a game? No need for turf protection between Tinkers and Alchemists when the list above is just a bit of fun and fancy?? Chill folks.<br />
<br />
As to alchemists versus tinkers. We Tinkers do have an expensive trade to learn but once we get above a certain level we can then work straight to GM. Whereas Shaman are stuck with a trade that is level capped and must work thier character up the levels before they can work their trade skill.<br />
<br />
Let's remember that we are allowed 8 characters per server and if we feel agreived that one class has a better plat earning ability over another then there is nothing to stop us starting a new character of that class ourselves. Then we can find out how bleeding hard it is for the other side to get to GM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, so here's a question for the alchemists who don't want gnomes to get to make those sort of devices: If the devices were powered by alchemy potions rather than mana batteries would you still oppose it?<br />
<br />
Personally I'd see it as a rather elegant solution to the problem. Tinkerers would get something new to make while alchemists still had their market, and with right implementation of it could even expand their market.</div></div><hr />

Minus the GVD pleeeeease.....the eyes are just too rare...GVD's sell for 10k-ish on my server...this bag would be then worth 15-20k &quot;street value&quot; and who'd buy that over the 5.25kpp bag?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nihixul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">note: the yo-yo we know was inspired by a sort of (Maori? probably not) tribal weapon</div></div><hr />

note: the yo-yo we know was inspired by a sort of (Maori? probably not) tribal weapon  <br />
<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
Sorry but not the case I'm afraid. The people you are talking about were Philipino tribemen who used to hide up trees and stun prey on the ground using rock tied up with string. However that practice was not known until the 16th century AD. They did not act in the same manner as a yoyo in that they did not spin up and down on the string. The string was just used to haul the rock back up the tree and save the hunter the effort of carrying several rocks up.<br />
<br />
However ceramic and stone YoYo's were found in Greece and dated to 500BC. These YoYo's were toys used by greek children but it is widely considered that they were based on toys brought over by traders from China. They show all the major design features of the modern YoYo in that they had a narrow spindle for the cord to wrap around with two flanking round discs to store kenetic energy and a hole for the string to be tied to. They even featured painted designs on the outside of the discs exactly like todays toys.<br />
<br />
It is not an accident that the chinese developed a spinning top which rides along an open string and looks remarkably similar to the YoYo. This open string riding top is called a Diablo in the west but there is a lot of doubt as to whether a Diablo is a YoYo which rides on an open string or a YoYo is a diablo with a fixed string. No-one is truly sure which toy came first. My own view is that the diablo came first and it was developed into the YoYo but there is little if any evidence to prove either way.<br />
<br />
Errr.... BTW, how did the history of YoYo's sneak this thread? Ah, never mind, found it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clearly you are lacking perspective from both sides of the fence.  <br />
<br />
Comparing Tinkering to Alchemy is laughable at best.  Alchemy has 3 major uses:  Gate potions, sow potions, ds potions.  Sure illusions sell from time to time but nothing reliable.   I can sell a 10 dose gate potion for 3k and make 500pp profit with max skill and no failures.  90% of the potions shamans get are cost prohibitive.  No one wants garbage potions that cost too much for their usefulness.<br />
<br />
Now Tinkering.  I can make a set of Clockwork Observer armor and make hmmm...40-50k profit of the set.  And you think Alchemy has anything over Tinkering?  Tinkering is probably my favorite tradeskill and very profitable between cultural, cams, anizoks etc.  <br />
<br />
Personally the only thing I'd like to see would be tinkered caster armor.  That's it, not clicky shaman potions that are rechargeable.  The alchemy market is weak enough as it is, just because there's over 100 potions doesnt mean more than 5-10 are worth making for a small profit.<br />
<br />

200 Alchemy  250 Tinkering (Alt)</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt you can ever expect REALLY useful items from tradeskilling again, after this GoD debacle(is this the right word?).<br />
<br />
And yeah, I'd definately love a Collapsible Forge, Brew Barrel, Kiln, and Pottery Wheel.  Along with the different tradeskill swiss army knives.  I have an entire toolbox in the bank devoted to baking tools, and I don't even bake that often~.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brodder FoamyMugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Lil hint from my time working with the DEv's on Brewing-<br />
<br />
<br />
  IF an item is funny, Fun, and has no real in game use it will likely get considered over something that will replace another tool anchor in game (brew barrel, forge etc).<br />
<br />
 With baking you've got spits that can be used for local cooking.<br />
<br />
 So for tinkering, make it fun!<br />
 Make it SILLY!<br />
 Make it a tool that's over specialized and hard to use or make-why? Because gnomes have to improve everything!<br />
<br />
 (Guess why the screw isn't mentioned anywhere in their invention lexicons? because it can't be improved and screws are rarely if ever mentioned in polite company.)<br />
<br />
 If it is fun, uses in game objects and loot, takes some time, is clever and funny- and most of all makes normal folks (read as non-tinkerers) shake their heads in disbelief! then these are what will get put in a discussion, versus something that might change in game balance.<br />
<br />
 Status Yoyo's would be great- so what if they could be 1hb weapons, make them not the best type for their cost ratios and speed-dmg rations- but do allow them to have slots for augs so they can get some proc's.<br />
 Make them Gnome halfling only...let mages wizards use them too (1h slash versions aka like daggers)<br />
<br />
 So be funny, organized a list (and inventors) break it down into a funny handbook (in gnomish of course).<br />
<br />
 And Tinkerer SHOULD BE A ACTIVE MERCHANT CLASS IN EQ2 WITH PETS!!!! The Hybrid Merchant Adventurer- TINKER MAGES!!!<br />

Great idea Brody. :D<br />

-------<br />
<br />
As for the tinkered sundial - that's not such a daft idea Lilosh. It's a tinkered sundial not a real sundial so it would have a small lightstone mounted on a clockwork driven arm to mimic the suns movement. You wouldn't need the sun to cast the shadow it would cast it's own shadow. I'm fairly certain I've read an article about just such an item made in RL. It's the sort of twist that would have amused Salvador Dali.<br />
<br />
And I'm sure that EQDal had taken into account when he made the suggestion is that the name for the study and construction of sundials is - GNOMONICS.<br />
<br />
Good call EQDal.</div></div><hr />
