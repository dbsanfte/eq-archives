<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i read the vital essence was bugged.... but i havent been able to forage surefall sap in qeynos hills. been here for over an hour and nothing.<br />
<br />
just wondering if they took the sap out of the game or moved where it is foraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">...or moved where it is foraged.Oh, you mean like adding Surefall Sap to the forage table for Surefall Glade? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'm sorry I can't help you.  I haven't foraged in either zone recently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tyber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looks like it can be found in Qeynos Hills, too. Got a few of them foraging there the other day with my druid.</div></div><hr />

My druid foraged some Surefall Sap in Surefall Glade :p Ah... good news.  The EQTraders database still only lists Qeynos Hills as the only zone to forage the sap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>trilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">apparently my druid still needs to do some better foraging!!<br />
<br />
all other places i have been able to get a few items in an hour, just had no luck in QH.<br />
<br />
i know i asked this before, but are there &quot;hot spots&quot; for foraging? the original answer was no, but this sap has annoyed me. i was standing at the qeynos zone line.<br />
<br />
im on the xegony server i wonder if my server has forgotten to replentish its surefall sap supply. :p</div></div><hr />
