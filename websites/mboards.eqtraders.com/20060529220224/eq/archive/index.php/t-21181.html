On a side note can anyone here tell me how to make a 10 stack of a poison?<br />
<br />
The quest is here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2253) for Grandmasters Assasin's Seal and I just finished it for my Rogue. Few warnings about the quest. First of all, it's an upgrade for your trophy that summons a 10 slot container to combine the poisons in to a 10 dose unit. You can not combine less then 10 to get less dose potions, has to be in 10. Second, not all poison is combinable to 10 dose unit. The Warlord's Rage did not combine but Scoriae Bite and Spine Rend did. I didn't test any other ones. <br />
<br />
The hardest part of the quest was doing the faction work. I spent 4 days, few hours a day wacking the Bandits in Karanas and my faction with circle of unseen hands went up very little. I must have killed about 300-400 of them and it only went from Amiable to low Warmly. The NPC did not give the quest. I am pretty sure you have to be at least high Warmly or Ally to get the quest. I got him to Ally just to make sure but it was taking way too long. Killing the Quenos guards/merchants was a bad idea. Only killed about 6 and went from Amiale to Dubious, so I gave up that idea fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
I find one area where it got me to Ally, that is in High Pass. if you are go to High Pass, near the front of High Keep ZI are three named mobs. They are on the same faction as the Bandits and I remember being killed by them on occasion when I was young. So, it was a revenge time. I did about 10 cycles of those 3 and went from Warmly to Ally, was able to finish the quest.<br />
<br />
The quest is simple, you have to make 8 of high end poisons, get a drop from the PoHate and your poison trophy. The NPC will give you a 10 slot container you put those in to and combine and return to the NPC for the upgraded GAS<br />
<br />
My Rogue is 290 on Poisonmaking atm. I thought it is more important to get the GAS rather then getting the last 10 points. Boy, was I wrong, it takes forever to do. Just a warning.<br />

<br />
Actually, I'm pretty sure you can make both 5 dose and 10 dose versions of any of the multi-dose combinable poisons.  (This closely parallels the situation with alchemy potions, by the way.)<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
In some cases, at least, the 5 dose poisons can be sold to merchants and other players while the 10 dose versions are no drop.  (I haven't checked them all to see if that is true of all of them, but I know it is true about the Scoriae Bite poison.)  This is useful knowledge for when you are working on that long skillup path to 300 because it could allow you to get back some of the cost of all those combines and allows you to avoid cluttering up your bank with bags and bags of no drop poisons rather than just destroying them along the way.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
It is worth noting here that when you combine poisons into the 5 and 10 dose versions you get back the advanced poison vials used to make the single doses.  That means you probably won't need more than a single stack of the advanced poison vials once you have your Grandmaster Assassin's Seal (GMAS).<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
It is also worth noting that after you have used your Grandmaster Assassin's Vial (GMAV) in the quest to get the GMAS you can make yourself another GMAV to summon those nifty 10 slot, 100% weight reducing bags.  That allows you to have what is effectively a disposable WR bag which you can destroy whenever you need space for a quest combine container, or a tradeskill combine container.  Then when you need the 10 slot WR container again you can just head over to the bazaar, summon it back and turn the no rent summoned bag for the &quot;rentable&quot; version again.<br />

<br />
Ah, you may be right. I never tried 5 of them, I have tried with 3 or 4 and didn't work.<br />
<br />

<br />
You are right about getting back the advanced poison vials. However, you will need more than a stack at a time due to failures and stuff. For example, you do a stack of combine and had one failure. That means you can make a 10 dose and a 5 dose but you can not combine the last 4 unless you do more combines. So those 4 vials will be &quot;tied up&quot; unless you do more combines to free them up. Often it never finishes neatly in stacks of 10 or 5.<br />
<br />
One note, I did ding 300 on poison making last night on my Rogue. No more poisons for a while for me. I have enough 10 dose potions around in different variety to last me for a while.  :) <br />

While its true that Scoriae Bite becomes no-drop when made into 10-dose, most  of the other droppable poisons will make droppable 5/10-dosers.  When I grinded my rogue's way to 300 skill, i found myself selling Scoriae Bite back to vendor singly, and all other droppable poison in 10-doses to save vials.  10-dose Oozing Irritation sells for about 210pp, and 10-dose Bite of the Shissar sells for about 140pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">04-04-2005, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you rogues would care to compile a list of inconsistencies with single and multi-dosed poisons, I'd be willing to pass it along to Maddoc as a whole, in the hopes of getting a more effective fix than separate bug reports about bits and pieces.  I'm talking about things like multi-doses being No Drop where the individual doses aren't, and vice versa, and other straightforward stuff that seems to be pretty clearly a bug.  <br />
<br />
If a list gets put together, just please PM me to point it out, as I don't read this forum thoroughly. :)<br />
<br />
If the problems are limited to just an item or two, a /bug report should suffice.</div></div><hr />

Quicker to do Rogues Errand quest to Max Ally with Circle of the Unseen Hand. Starts in rogue guild at North Quenos, speak to Zannsin Resdinet, he gives you a bent playing card which you need to give to Jracol Brestiage  by North Quenos zoneline (spawns at night only, a static Gnoll is his PH). Not a huge faction jump each note, but the note is NOT LORE, so with a bit of spamming you can do 80 notes at a time. I went to Max ally from indiff with about 240 cards (4 trips, took me 3 game days). Also went to threatening with the Quenos guards, but back to warm after 4 reality days in Blackburrow (blackburrow cask - burning rapier - mastersketch, as a rogue im sure you know what im talking about).</div></div><hr />
