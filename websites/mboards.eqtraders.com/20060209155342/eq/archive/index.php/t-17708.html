<br />
My main is a cleric of Erollisi Marr who can imbue rose quartz (will be needed for her high end cultural smithing) but otherwise I am stranded with a wood elf who needs tons of imbued emeralds for cultural fletching and a rallos zek barbarian who needs jade for cultural smithing.<br />
<br />
furthermore my ranger has foraged some stacks of plains pebbles which my cleric could use to make cultural stuff for him.<br />
<br />
So I am seeking desperately for clerics, druids or shammies who would do these imbues for me. I am willing to provide the spells, pay per stack or share in case some karana cleric/druid needs plains pebbles herself. I would also trade imbued rose quartz on a 3:1 base for imbued jade or PP<br />
<br />
If you want to contact me - my main toon is Enyaa Clannad (36th human cleric - to be found in Pok or the wayfarers camps)</div></div><hr />
