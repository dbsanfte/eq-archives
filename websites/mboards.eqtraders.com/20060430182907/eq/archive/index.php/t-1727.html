<br />
I am a level 35 high Elf Smith, with a Smithing skill of 192. It has been 192 for well over 6 months, literally hundreds of skillup combines, with NO increase in skill.<br />
My stats are:<br />
Str 102<br />
Wis 218<br />
Int 108<br />
<br />
I'm wearing nearly a full set of (imbued) Koada'Dal Mithril Plate, which I made. I've also made a couple pieces of Acrylia, many pieces of imbued Elven Chain and even 2 Mistletoe Cutting Sickles. Nothing has helped. I hit 192 BEFORE the big trivial adjustments, and made well over 100 non-trivial Fine Plate combines. PLEASE!!! If anyone has any information regarding possible causes, post it. I'm about to lose my (character's) mind.<br />

WIS at 255 and STR at 190(I know only the wis matters, but I am superstitious). My skill has been stuck at 193 since the trivial change 8 months ago. Am currently at well over 300 combines of both &quot;old&quot; cultural and a few acrylia and sickle attempts(and a couple dozen FP attempts made before the change). <br />

I am experiencing the same thing you are. Just hang in there and hopefully we will both get out of it.</div></div><hr />

I am actually thinking of just going ahead and switching out of fine steel and into field plate (I'm a human).  Sure, my failure rate will be greater, and my costs higher, but I am convinced I get more skillups the farther I am from trival...</div></div><hr />

Always smith with 255int and IS and I've been stuck at 200 for 125 (as per my tally sheet) non-trivial combines.

I think when he says 'NTCM' he means New Tannan Crafting Mastery.  <br />
<br />
Looks like he invested 3 AA's and still can't get it over 200 :(<br />
<br />
Only thing I'd check is to see if he accidentially went 201 baking them MTP's for the guild or some such, hehe.</div></div><hr />

It kind of still makes me ill to think of those dark days. I thought it was broken. I tried everything to get out. I don't know how or why I managed to keep at it, except I wanted to make armor. Glad I kept with it :)<br />
I agree you have to get one stat to 255 (str wis or int). Str is easiest, i.e. costs the least, and believe me str works in smithing ( I went to 250 skill with int/wis around 75,80 :)</div></div><hr />

On average I make 1 pt every 19.3 combines with my monk up.   However from 216 to 217 it took taken 138 combines (skewing the average just a little).  So be prepared to hit hell levels in certain spots too. <br />

<br />
There have been numerous posts and my own experience that you are more likely to get skill ups the closer to trivial you get because you get more skillups on success than on failure and you get more success the higher your skill is.  ie do the fine plate to the bitter end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quendi_Selli</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually that's not quite right, there have been lots of posts proposing either answer.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm convinced you have a certain percent chance to skill up on each non-trivial combine.  This would be similar to the way other skills work - such as foraging going up just as often when you forage something as when you don't.  At first you stink and rarely forage anything but later you frequently get something when you forage - in both cases the chance to improve your skill was about the same based on the same rate of improvement.<br />
<br />
So this means...<br />
<br />
If you smith stuff close to trivial you will get lots of successes and thus most skill-ups will come on successes.  If you smith stuff far from trivial you will get lots of failures and thus lots of skill-ups on failures.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cavel</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK here is what I do when I see a streak of 50+combines without a skill up:<br />
<br />
1) Finish all Trivial combines that stack (Making old Cultural in this example)<br />
  a) enchanted Folded sheets of Mithrial<br />
  b) Enchanted Mithrial Rings<br />
2) Go Exp'ing for a while, collect Morning dew and burn down MM for essence of moonlight.<br />
3) log off for the night<br />
4) come back the next day and attempt the remaining combines.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that doing multiple attempts at one time seems to give me better skill ups, where as I will get streaky if I only do 1 or 2 at a time. Example 50 attempts to get one point when I did not skill after 1 or 2 combines vs 7 attempts to get 206 when I did all 7 in a row. Then again could just be the Darn RNG.<br />

Maybe try changing the combines you are doing to something else for a while to break your run of bad luck.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm expecting to get some really bad hell levels later on to balance the luck I've had so far.</div></div><hr />
