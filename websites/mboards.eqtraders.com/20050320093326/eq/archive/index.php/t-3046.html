I used to play Civ and Civclone games but ever since I got EQ I think to myself, &quot;Why am I wasting playtime when I could be leveling or tradeskilling?&quot;<br />
<br />
So, what other games are being played? Does anyone play multiple games while EQing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
Before I started playing EQ a year ago I played a lot of games, Civ 3, Heroes of Might and magic, etc.<br />
<br />
Actually since I started playing I bought Warcraft 3... and played it 3 times.  Game looks fantastic, great graphics, compelling storyline etc.  but I still wanted to be in EQ leveling or tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
Thinking about it, I have probably saved money in the long run, as I used to buy a game every month, now I just pay for the same one over and over again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I want to interact with other people, but want time off from levelling, I role-play on a MUD that I frequent.<br />
<br />
When I don't want to interact with other people, but feel like levelling, I play my beastlord twink.</div></div><hr />

I get that feeling on a lot of other games, too :(  Its really annoying - has sucked the enjoyment out of a lot of RTS games, imo.  And for RPGs, most have &quot;beyond-final-battle&quot; stuff you can do on the world map, often that requires a bit of grind or a lot of time. With EQ, these offline single-player worlds seem much harder to justify spending the time to access that type of time-consuming content, since in EQ, even when you're doing that horribly boring long timeconsuming goal you are forever improving your ongoing socially-useful character (even if only in statistical probability).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twofury</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i play Shogun and Medieval (Total War), outside of computerworld i play D&amp;D, Vampire, Werewolf, Warhammer fantasy battles, Warhammer 40k (and various other GW games)<br />
<br />
I do not feel that playing these other games is wasting EQ time, but mainly because i play Shogun and Medieval to play something else then EQ all the time, and I play the other games far longer than i have been playing EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gillin Whisperfoot</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see, I've recently loaded up diablo II again... my girlfriend and I play that occasionally when we are sick of the morons we meet while hunting in EQ. It's got some fun hack and slashing. <br />
<br />
Dungeon Keeper I and II. Fun games. Nothing can beat slapping your minions to make them work faster, or just when you want to kill a particularly troublesome minion, slap em to death. And the screams from the Torture Chamber just make me smile. Unfortunately I beat the last level on Dungeon Keeper II last month... so now I'm not playing it. And that guy who tells you the dark elf is annoyed because she has been slapped did get on my nerves a bit... But then the dark elf died and I was happy again.  twisted <br />
<br />
Thief II. Never finished this one... but the original thief game was a blast. Unfortunately, I can only play this one at night as during the day there is too much glare on the screen. Also, I've misplaced my headphones... and sound makes half the game.<br />
<br />
I've also made a couple characters on Firiona Vie server to explore untwinkness and experience a server with less population. I also enjoy the feeling of being on a 'role-play' server... Not sure what it is, but I am enjoying it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first two years I played EQ I neither bought nor played any single player games.   When DaoC came out my guild decamped for it, so my husband and I also played it.    We still had 2 standing groups in EQ, but with Luclin no one could stay connected so we went about 2 months without playing at all, simultaneously our time in DaoC diminished as our friends stopped playing completely.   So, we briefly played Baldur's Gate 2 together, followed by my foray into Icewind Dale till I was about half through.  Then one of our gaming friends raved about Wizardry 8 and we picked up two copies, playing obsessively till we both Ascended.   This was immediately followed by Dungeon Siege (2 copies again), played to completion.   My husband then got both Jedi Knight and Freedom Force, while I picked up Might and Magic (which was awful).  Two copies each of Morrowind (neither of us finished) and Neverwinter Nights (barely played) later and we returned full time to EQ&#8230;&#8230;  I bought Divine Divinity, but haven't played it yet.    I'd say EQ is cheap in comparison to our single player habit, wouldn't you?   :D</div></div><hr />
