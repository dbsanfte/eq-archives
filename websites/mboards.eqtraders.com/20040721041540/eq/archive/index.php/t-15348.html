<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rerashyaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kaladim Constitutionals, Grobb Liquidised Meat, Qeynos Afternoon Tea if you happen to know a forager or get lucky on vendor dives.  Dyes for tailoring ribbons, LDoN tempers, chocolate milk and lemonade.  Sure, the dyes and tempers don't require you to be a GM, but it's nice to know your chance of failure is about as low as it can possibly be.  Check the recipies, check the bazaar, and decide if any of these options are worth your time. Depending on your class/level and the condition of your bazaar, a better plat option may be &quot;kill things and loot their slowly cooling bodies&quot; but at least you can make your own root beer floats. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to make tainted avalanche ale (TAA) for MQ. I made about 120 of them and sold them mostly for around 2k. Some as high as 5k, some as low as 1k. And if folks blew Peffin, I gave them one free replacement.<br />
<br />
I considered making Kaladim Constitutionals, but decided there was not enough profit in them. With a triv of 335, and a skill of 250, I fail about half the combines. So I only make them for myself, and have the metabolism 3 AA on all my upper level characters to make them last longer. There are too many subcombines on Grobb Liquidised Meats for me to bother with. My foraging characters have never managed to snag 1 leaf for the tea, so I have never made one.<br />
<br />
This character (Saleani) was originally a model for plate armor that I made on a diff char until someone (who has since quit the game) asked me to get my brewing skill up to make some TAA for them. Due to server politics, very few high level characters were willing to associate, or do anything with the members in that guild. And I had wanted to grandmaster other things on my other characters (like tailoring on my halfling, smithing on my barb, that sort of thing). At the time I got brewing to the point I could make TAA, I next had to level up to where I could fight the wyverns, and get non kos to them. When I first started, 2 years ago, I was one of the first to sell the MQs on our server: most folks making that ale, were only doing it for guildies, and not selling the ale to outsiders except maybe for 10k+. The list of &gt;200 skill brewers willing to press combine for others (outside their guild) was small enough that you could count them on both thumbs. There were no AAs at the time I started all this, so one could not be a master of all tradeskills, like Saleani is now. Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm the tradeskiller for a very small group of friends; there's less than a half dozen of us. They all Forage and seem to like to hang out in East Karana. They bring me scads of Tea Leaves, which allows all of us to make a fortune in Qeynos Afternoon Teas; that doesn't even address the Skins and Silks they bring me/us. <br />
<br />
Don't overlook selling Tradeskill subcombines :)<br />
<br />
(edit) The Market for QAT's is not suffering on Veeshan; we typically sell 300 or so a night, or however many we have Leaves for. We seem to have a handfull of buyers who will take all we've got, and they're apparently not being resold; at least not by the buyer, and I don't see the quantity available in the Bazaar being higher at a higher price. One guy bought 620 at one whack, all we had (one of our regular buyers). Kinda smells like some sort of exploit, but I don't have a clue what it might be (just a guess).</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more!  I think I've sold Bayle's delight for 50pp before!<br />

<br />
or just sell the EoS's for 500-1000 P each....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ancarett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My 40 druid has been doing very well selling ribbon dyes at 75 plat a pop in Veeshan's bazaar. She routinely makes several thousand plat a night when in merchant mode! If you have a forager or can merchant mine in the right zones, this type of brewing seems easily profitable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did Kaladim's, but it seems the market is bacoming a bit clogged with other suppliers.<br />
<br />
But I made 2k profit on 6 stacks of combines. <br />
<br />
Made a dorf whose soul job was to log in, pick up mushrooms and log off.<br />
No bags, but when ever he had 3 stacks of each mushroom (having 2 slots for food/drink) he ran to the bank and dumped them in there.<br />
I then picked up the delivery and 400pp. Went around PoK buying the rest of the ingredients and generally had 27pp left over with no sub combine failures.<br />
<br />
252 skill = approx 6 stacks of Kaladim's<br />
20pp per Kaladim = 400pp per stack<br />
6 stacks at 400pp = 2400pp in the Bazaar.<br />
2400pp - 400pp = 2000pp profit.<br />
<br />
But now there are more people trying to sell them and for less, so I am not selling anywhere near as often. So I'd say the money on them can be good, market allowing.<br />
<br />
Tea = can't get enough leaves, don't like buying to too much from Bazaar and also alot more people making them.<br />
<br />
Grobb = Too much time spent making for little profit.<br />
<br />
Not tried selling other stuff as I am a smith so use any tempers I make generally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>pscracke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have for the longest time taken to brewing Heady Kiolas. At a really low price (4pp for the stacks of sap and trivial amount for the bottles/water) you can make a stack of kiolas. Price varies for server to server, but on Sol Ro, they can be sold easily for 3pp a piece, and sometimes more. (I have seen them up as high as 5.)<br />
<br />
This has been made even easier with the new interface, though it wasn't bad with the old one.<br />
<br />
People who are doing Wu's armor and don't want to go through the hastle of clicking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gougers are why most smiths have gotten out of the heraldic market unless they are clicking for someone else. =P</div></div><hr />

Amen. You can sell ANYTHING in the Bazaar. We routinely sell anything any of us can Forage; you're right, you won't make a fortune, but it's free, why not?<br />
<br />
The money I've had and have now was all derived from selling Tradeskill subcombines or even individual items like Veggies. I haven't made a fortune, but it's got me some nice Ornate Gear and a myriad of other pieces, plus I've still got 150k in the bank and it's climbing daily.</div></div><hr />
