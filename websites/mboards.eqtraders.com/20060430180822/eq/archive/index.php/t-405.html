<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*grin*  This question gets asked a couple of times a week, maybe we should make the answer a sticky or something.<br />
<br />
The best place for consistant acrylia drops seems to be acrylia caverns, if you can put together a group to hunt there.  Other zones have mobs that drop it, on a very random basis.  Usually wherever there are grimlings or the monkey men.</div></div><hr />

Laborer cave is far better since the Labor tends to drop acrylia, sometimes even 2.  also, if you're lucky you can get windstones as well here.  i'd say Tenebrous Mtns if you're 35+, Acrylia Caverns if you're 53+ or maybe even lower if ya have a group.<br />

I'll add something to the FAQ.  If you think any other questions get posted here a lot, feel free to post a Q&amp;A in the FAQ thread, and I'll see that it gets added.</div></div><hr />
