Anywho this is just to see what people think of the design and setup of this only has wiz/enc spells working atm. Will possibly merge in complete spell listings and such depending on time allotment and possibly much much more. This is in .zip/.sfv for integrity checking. Working on a .msi installer script to make for smooth updates and installation and for the ability to choose just a certain spell type/class/ect.. ti be more configuragble for the user. Please email or post back all comments and suggestions as i am just starting to expand this project. Positive and negative wanted!<br />
edit: the crc32/md5 sums in the readme wount be apperaing there will post by sfv and listing on webpage.<br />

<br />
I do have one request though.  At the moment it puts everything straight into the story folder.  So you end up with 9 folders and 3 files straight into the story folder.<br />
<br />
Can you move everything (except the storyBritneyy.txt obviously) into a subfolder?  It would make thinks a little tidier.</div></div><hr />
