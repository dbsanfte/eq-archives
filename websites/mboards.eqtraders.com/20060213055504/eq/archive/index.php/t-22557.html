I scouted around the zone line this weekend, and found no mermaids or sharks, but I did have my fill of green fishies, very aggressive fishies.  <br />
<br />
I took my camo'ed druid in, and tracked out a few mermaids that weren't too hard to find and camped him at the zone.<br />
<br />
Swithched over to the cleric, popped a cloudy potion, and went in.  <br />
<br />
Long story short, three mermaids was just a bit more than I could handle (was surprised, or maybe I might have stood a chance...)  Consented my druid, logged off the cleric, and pulled the corpse....<br />
<br />
I figure one more person of about any class and we should be able to pull it off, but it may take some time.  Of course, the more, the merrier!<br />
<br />
Anyone that is interested in trying this and wants a healer/nuker along for company, give Zabu or Euell a holler.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For that matter, if you are working on non-human book quests and need a healer/tracker/etc. I'm always available!  Tradeskill raids are about the only kind I go on anymore :)</div></div><hr />

Humans have the luxury that their expert book quest can be done in two places. Qeynos sends you to kedge keep. East Freeport sends you to the hole to kill elemental warriors.</div></div><hr />

Oooohhh....<br />
<br />
Hadn't considered that.  Thanks for the reminder!<br />
<br />
BTW, how do you get in there?  I remember seeing a key for sale when I first started my necro in paineel, but I'm sure there must be another way, since none of my other chars would be welcome anywhere near there?</div></div><hr />

Two ways in, make yourself small and crawl through the space near the rock at zone in. Second way is to go and kill for a couple of hours in the warrens and get your paineel faction up. that way you can get the key to paineel and buy the key to the hole there.</div></div><hr />

Look out, kobolds, here I come...</div></div><hr />

Next night saw dubious.  Third night, I got the bright idea to try picking up a key with my Erudite Necro.  Of course it is No Trade.  Back to the Warrens.  I was too tired to check faction that night, so I just camped.<br />
<br />
Thought of something else this morning in the shower?  2 essence of Erudite potions.  One to get the Paineel key, one once I zone in to make it to the vendor and buy the key....<br />

This has me believing I might be on to something.  I'll give it a shot the next time I'm on.</div></div><hr />

Yup, worked - amiable.  Could have saved myself a lot of time.  Only one potion, btw, I forgot that you don't actually zone into the city, you are already technically there.  [Be sure to leave a dose in the bank for an emergency.  Seems the hole key doesn't get added to the keyring.]<br />

15 elemental warriors, no mercury.  Tick, tock...</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, we have (had) success.  Anyone who is offered this task should grab it.  The mobs are right at the zone in, and are EASILY single pulled, even by the lower levels that are heading in for exp.  <br />
<br />
At 60, about a third of the elementals turned up light blue, so there was a bit of AA to be had while I ground out the required number of kills.  Less than one KEI duration took care of the 50 warriors, the trip back to FP, and back to the hole for 5 monstrosities, as well as derailing a few trains, doing a few rezzes, and some tag-along healing to help level someone's chanter.<br />
<br />
The bad new is, the symbols (as well as the armor) don't sell to the merchants, and can't be tributed.  They has a very high success rate, as well, so you get to trash them as you make them (owwww!)<br />
<br />
Now, on to the good part.  41 symbol combines and (about) 15 LoY robes netted 4 skill-ups to 220.  Not too bad considering the low cost involved.  I think the expert symbols/armor take me to 222, then it's back to robes only, I guess.   :(</div></div><hr />
