Thus, I am currenly in need of some help on the shawl quests. I managed to finish shawls 1 thru 6 solo, but I am having trouble rounding up help for the swordfish on shawl 7. I am currently a level 57 beastlord and might have tried a few times solo at 56, but adds have forced me to run like a kitten.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to help me with the hunting side of shawl 7 and 8? I am willing to help you out as well. I cannot seem to round up a group that is interested in heading to Sirens Grotto or Western Wastes.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
You remember correctly about the Khati Sha Officer's Cloak. I still use it. The next cloak in the series requires an army to win (40 people at level 60+).<br />
<br />
I will try to find you in game. I would obviously love to help you out as well.<br />
