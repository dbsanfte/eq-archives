<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>robsf115</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just finished a full set of shadow walker and observer armor.  But having trouble getting consistant pricing on these items.  Everyone in the bazaar just seems to price this stuff at or around whatever the other vendors are selling it for.  <br />
<br />
Not so much the observer armor, but especially the shadow walker stuff.  Thanks in advance.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Economics says that &quot;whatever the other vendors are selling it for.&quot;  would be the right price for your server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not sure what you're looking for, though.<br />
<br />
If we tell you a higher price, then you'll charge it, and the people on your server won't pay it, since others sell it cheaper.<br />
If we tell you a lower price, then you'll be selling for less than the market will bear.<br />
Seems like a lose-lose situation to me.<br />
<br />
Pick a price that you like, and that will sell, and go with it.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>robsf115</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right now...I don't even have it listed.  Because I can't seem to get an average for what it's worth.  That's what I'm looking for, an average.  There's no right or wrong high or low price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Look for different items of similar stats, then consider who can wear.<br />
<br />
The shadowwalker armor is clearly for the gnome rogues out there.  Yes, clerics, pallies, etc can wear it, but why bother when the observer stuff is better.<br />
<br />
So your market is what gnome rogues specifically (any deity) can buy that have similar stats.<br />
<br />
And the others are correct, prices will vary by server.  So you'll need to do research on where yours is at currently.<br />
<br />
I have a good idea of what observer armor sells for on my server (usually a bit more than the Dwarf Culteral Brell only armor), but the only rogue stuff I made was to twink my rogue alt, so not sure of those prices on CT.<br />
<br />
For example, an Dwarven Culteral Brell bracer can be purchased for around 5K.  I can sell an observer bracer for about 6K with little trouble.  The reason clearly is it's for any gnome regardless of deity, whereas the dwarven culteral is for small races who worship Brell only.  Similar market so I use one to help price the other.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for that bit of info Ixiola.<br />
<br />
I'd been assuming that since there were two recipes for the clockwork armour the final armour would have a deity restriction based on what imbued gem was used. But because you mentioned it I went back to check and you're correct, there is no deity restriction on the final armour. So a Bertoxxulous worshipping gnome can use armour made using Brell imbued rubies which are much easier to get than Bertoxxulous imbued black sapphires - great!<br />
<br />
For my money I'd much rather keep black sapphires for making artisans seals than risk them on armour with a trivial of over 300.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use rubies as well, but that's because my gnome cleric worships brell so I do my own imbuing.  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Will depend greatly on your server's gnomish economics.<br />
<br />
My prices for Shadowwalker/Observer pieces average 12k for tunic and 3k-5k for other pieces. No, they don't sell well. *chuckle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I charge 3k+1000 per BD, except boots, the pita of the fauns and the fact that other cultural armors boots are 2 BDs, they go for 5k.  They don't sell, really.  BPs are considerably more, since they take a GVD and haze panther eyes are scarce on my server.  Not worth the time it takes to farm them either.<br />
<br />
Chain really doesn't sell.  Cultural chain has crappy stats compared to drops.  SoV added a lot of good chain and, well, the cultural got hosed for stats.  Charge what you want, odds are it won't sell anyway;)</div></div><hr />
