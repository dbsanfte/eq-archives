<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarelna Prexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just checking my bazaar trader and I noticed someone selling a sandwich of foul smelling herbs  (? ) . Came up when I searched for foods.  This is not listed in the database. Is this new or  just a mob dropped item    ?<br />

ps. At least i think that was what its called, was in a hurry to log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, I can't confirm anything on this but found it amusing since if it is what you saw it would be a nod to the old Zork games. The true pioneers of computer role-playing games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Leysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I remember reading years ago, the sammich of foul smelling herbs, and vile sarnak brew(?), can go in the range slot and will never be consumed.  With stats being added to food/drink I'm not sure how these work/stack with food in your packs...if the range item is used and pack food is ignored etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>QuteCleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Erm, it would work like any other ranged item with stats...<br />
<br />
As for where it comes from, it drops in Chardok, don't have any reason to believe there is a recipe for it...<br />
