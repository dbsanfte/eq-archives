[Tue Feb 17 01:36:30 2004] Orgmar says 'You have got ta help me, lad!  That ghost there in the corner won't [leave] me alone!  Where ever I go he follows me!'<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:34 2004] Baelin Vargaroth hums a catchy, rhythmic tune.<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:35 2004] You say, 'leave'<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:35 2004] Orgmar says 'I think I took somethin' o' his and he wants it back.  Ya got ta [help] me get rid of this ghost, lad!  I taint slept in over a fortnight.'<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:39 2004] You say, 'help'<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:39 2004] Orgmar says 'I went explorin' one day in some sewers in the new land.  I came across a rottin' satchel on the ground.  Inside were some strange gems.  I couldn't resist.  I took the satchel back here to me room.  A day or two later, this ghost appeared.  Scared me out o' me chainmail it did.  It kept moanin' about wantin' its satchel back.  I didn't know what ta do so I went back to the sewers and chucked it into the water.  Thought it might appease it or somethin'.  That didn't work though and the darn ghost still comes back.  Please find the satchel and bring it back ere.  Maybe if I can give the satchel to the ghost, it will make him go away for good!'<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:42 2004] Durew saved.<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:53 2004] You say, 'The ghost he's referring to is Yitandi'<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:55 2004] You say, 'Hail, Yitandi'<br />
[Tue Feb 17 01:36:55 2004] Yitandi moans in a sad, wispy voice. 'Death. . . coming for all . . .'<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone try giving this kit to the ghost Yitandi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Doremi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's the link to the completed quest, for those interested:  Orgmar's Haunt (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2747)<br />
<br />
My guess is that the Baelin's Gem Kit drop is a typo during itemization.  It's actually used in a Chardok B quest (Help Baelin (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2513)).  Make sure to /feedback and/or /bug the drop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The black amulet (result of the quest) also drops there.</div></div><hr />

The black amulet (result of the quest) also drops there.  <br />
<br />
Definitely sounds like an itemization error then.  It would be akin to having JBoots drop off a mob in the game.  Be sure to /bug it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">whaddaya mean akin to having jboots drop in the game. :P<br />
<br />
thats how i got mine!!!<br />
<br />
i hated drezlna's room bout a dozen people in there when i camped my jboots<br />
<br />
They should put the jboot drop back in. not like they are too uber anymore and najena needs visiters</div></div><hr />

She sure has a lot of visitors now. :) Good thing they didn't put Fabled Rubi in CT, I can just imagine the /petitions now :boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Breezan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bizare as this is, the kit is for the chardok B quest to combine the glittering gems :/ , I had the 4 gems in the bank and decided to try it and it worked. I surely hope that it is a screw up in the loot table very odd to have this drop with no other purpose.</div></div><hr />
