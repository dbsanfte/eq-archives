<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brodybeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know much about Everquest fletching (haven't started the 7th shawl quest yet :p ).  Could someone tell me which of these tinkered PoP bow cams bowyers might find to be useful?  Are some of these cams not worth tinkering because the finished bow is crappy or the other raw materials are just too hard to find?  And what would you consider to be fair prices for these cams?<br />
<br />
E'cian Ice Bow Cam<br />
Innovative Bow Cam<br />
Molten Metal Bow Cam<br />
Planar Steel Bow Cam<br />
Wind Metal Bow Cam<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The E'Cian Ice cams are used for Aid Grimel quest so people use those. The Innovative Bow Cams are used for nightmare bows so some people use those. I'd say the E'Cian Ice would be your best bet right with the Planar Cams for the stonewood bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greymantle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All are useful, availablity seems to be the driving force for pricing. The prices vary insanely. On the rathe innovate cams go for 500-800p on average. Molton ones down around 200 because tinkers use them to skill up on due the availablity of molten ore. Immaculate steel ones 6-10k atm, not many for sale, Ice and wind go anywhere for 20k-50k each. Lot has to do with the relative cost of the bows too. Nightmares going for 2.5k-5k , stonewoods 220k+, obsidionwoods 125k . Have not seen the others for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it's the Wind Metal Bow Cams.  As far as your list goes here are my feelings.<br />
<br />
Wind Metal Bow Cams <br />
Metal Rarity - Semi-rare plus noone exps in Air<br />
<br />
Comments - The Featherwood bow is supposed to be the best Ranger bow.  The cams are also used in the Aid Grimel bow.  Lastly, the other Air recipes that use Wind Metal are pretty lousy (aside from the JC item maybe).<br />
<br />
Price - I've seen them sell for 10k usually on Prexus<br />
<br />
Planar Steel Bow Cams<br />
Metal Rarity - Very common<br />
<br />
Comments - Stonewood bows sell like crazy.  I am always running out of these.  The metal is also used in making studs for the leather armor that sells really well, but the metal is an extremely common drop.<br />
<br />
Price - At most, I'd pay 250pp for one<br />
<br />
Molten Bow Cam<br />
Metal Rarity - So common that it rots most of the time<br />
<br />
Comments - The Obsidianwood bow sells fast, but the string for the bow is made from items that only drop off the Fennin Ro event and Blazzax in Fire.  These bows are pretty rare.<br />
<br />
Price - At most, I'd pay 250pp for one<br />
<br />
E'cian Ice Bow Cams<br />
Rarity - Uncommon<br />
<br />
Comments - The Primordial Driftwood bow isn't all that great.  Also, this metal is used in making Farwater Scale and Farwater Plate armors.  I do most of the combines for my guild and I only use the metal in Farwater combines.<br />
<br />
Price - I've seen the metal itself sell for 5-10k each<br />
<br />
Innovative Bow Cams<br />
No clue on these</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on which ranger you ask.<br />
<br />
There are those that prefer Featherwood, and there are those that prefer Stonewood.  I've looked at several of the parses and the write-ups for them, of the Elemental bows, and all pretty much say the same thing:  When it all boils down to the very end, there is from top to bottom, only a couple points of DPS difference between the &quot;Best&quot; and the &quot;Worst&quot; Elemental bow, with Stone and Feather at the top of the list.  Basically coming down to speed at the cost of damage, or damage at the cost of speed.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the record:<br />
&lt;--- Stonewood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play a not-flagged-for-anything ranger and so I shop the bazaar for my fletching opportunities.  The description above matches my perception of rarity: e'cian and wind metal are simply darn rare as are the cams.  On the othe rhand, immaculate steel and molten metal are not rare at all (you can grab a lot off of NPCs in POT) to the point where the grease and the tinkering skill are the harder to find items.<br />
<br />
On E'ci, the offered prices look like this:<br />
<br />
Innovative Cams: 100-300pp per (and they sit there unpurchased for long stretches, b/c the silk is the rare component for Nightmarewood bows)<br />
<br />
Molten Cam: 1K<br />
Planar Cam: Variable, 1K-5K, not available long at the low end.<br />
Wind Cam: Not available, wind metal 5k-15K (yes)<br />
E'ci Cam -- neither cams nor metal has been offered within the last 30 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The nightmare arachnid silk is the rare part of the nightmarewood bow. I would buy more innovative cams, if i could also get the silk. The silk market dried up when the creeper spiders stopped dropping ethereal parchments from what I hear. If someone were to offer nightmare arachnid silk and innovative bow cams I'd be in heaven...<br />
<br />
Well, actually, if I could afford or otherwise get my hands on the elemental bow combine stuff, then I'd be in heaven...but nightmarewood bow supplies would make me very happy indeed.</div></div><hr />
