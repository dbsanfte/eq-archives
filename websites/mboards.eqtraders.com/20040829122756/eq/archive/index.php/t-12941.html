Welcome to the most retarded combine Sony ever put in for JC. Its like someone sat back and said, hmmm, getting to 250 in JC is so easy.. we might as well make this combine have an atrocious success rate to compensate!<br />
<br />
On good days i see 50% success rate at 250 in JC. Enchanter with JCM2 and 250 also had about the same success rate. 2/12? Ouch.<br />

I think I was doing about 7 or 8 in 10 on the Gem Studded Chain.<br />

Than they started to fiddle with JCM AA and I havent tried since.<br />

Crag catch me in game, bring a jewel kit and this chanter will hook you up during some raid.</div></div><hr />

Sorry I do not have exact data, but I remember doing lil less than two stacks of combines and ending with at least 10-12 chains.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had to do a run of them last night it really is a money sink making these things. I used to be able to make 70-80% in the past so I thought it would have stayed that way.<br />
<br />
First tried with my Cleric, 250 JC plus trophy. I went 1 for 5. I thought that can't be right. So I got 5 more tries with my Chanter who is 250 JC, trophy and JCM 1. I went 0 for 5. Woah, something has changed. I went and got a stack of each to make. I ended up doing 19 combines, **** Worked Silver Chain failed with 237 smithing with trophy. Out of 19, I got 5. About 25%. That really is lower than what I expected. Now it seem I will have to get those JCM 2 and 3 points. Oh well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Recently ive needed some chains so i could work tailoring up on robes. No JCM3 chanters nearby so i made em myself and i have been getting about a 50% success rate at 250+geerlok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been 250 JC with trophy for quite awhile, but I do not have any aa's as I am not an enchanter.  I have 280 wisdom, also.  I have been working on robes for the past 2 months.  Only last week, did I notice a significant failure rate.  Previously, I could make a good 12 out of 20 on my worst run.  Now, I am getting a success of only 4 on my worst run.<br />
<br />
I highly suggest feedbacking, /bug, or petitioning this.  In my opinion, something is wrong and it happened long after messing with JCM aa's.<br />
<br />
I did petition this the day before the patch.  The &quot;Guide&quot; told me it was nothing.  I said I would try again after patch and let them know.  Since then, I have /feedback and /bug.<br />
<br />
I have also noticed a higher rate of failure on bloodmetal earrings.</div></div><hr />

Went 2 for 8, which really surprised her.  She had some unspent AA points and mentioned she will use them for AA mastery.  I'll likely try another run of these next weekend and update with the rate.<br />

5/5 Valo Rings<br />
2/3 Steel Ring (Earth)<br />

JCM3 sounds like a huge difference, or maybe I was just unlucky with JCM2.</div></div><hr />

I don't have exact figures anymore but i guess i failed between 3 or 5 per stack materials. <br />

JCM3, 250 skill and trophy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just did 66 combines with JCM2, and only finished with 37, includeing a fail run of 13 in a row, having JCM2 has not seemed to be helping that much with anything but my frustration rate.<br />
<br />
I will get JCM3 eventually, but will have to see how far these 37 get me &gt;&lt;<br />

Hurts when you fail one of these, and I'm not exactly looking forward to succeeding on solstice robes with them either :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Went 9/10 on these yesterday, 250 + geerlok, no JCM. :eek:<br />

Talk about a good streak. Usually I'll go 3/10 or 4/10, sometimes 5/10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Personally, I would buy these rather than get them made. <br />

On Fennin at least, they sell in the bazaar for around 800pp... that's a better deal that eating all the many failures, imo.</div></div><hr />
