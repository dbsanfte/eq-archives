<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Machtig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've searched and searched the EQtraders site, and these boards but i still can't find any arrows that have a range greater than 170!<br />
<br />
I know that there are bows that have 200+ range on them, but are there arrows that have the range to match?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they add together.  200 bow + 150 arrow is 350 range.  without and extended range item that is farther than any spellcaster spell.  i think their might be a problem with distance in the game.  i know i can stand far enough away to bolt stuff so that it won't aggro me.  kinda pointless with a lv 16 nuke at lv 46 but its possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Machtig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That clears it up a lot for me...here i thought that it took the base bow range, and that was the maximum possible range, then the arrow's range was how far the arrow would actually go.<br />
<br />
This makes a lot more sense now...and it means that all of those 5 range arrows i skilled up with actually would have still worked to hunt with...oops!<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />
