<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Varillian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there no new recipes for poisons in LDoN?<br />
Already know of some stuff that´s usable with tradeskills but not mentioned in the database.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nobody has reported any yet.<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean there aren't any, just that non have been reported here yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tibis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There were no new spell effects of a poison-like nature added with LDoN.  It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that there have been no new poisons added with the new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arcturos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So far, all I have seen are some Slot 4 augmentations that proc a poison based DD attack.  They can be found on the East Commonlands Adventure Merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeght</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There seem to be a fair (pr perhaps unfair? ) number of LDoN tradeskill drops with no currently known recipies attached.<br />
<br />
We are told there are undiscovered recipies (by way of the fan faire trade skill forum).<br />
<br />
Nightshade is a poison ingredient, RL...<br />
<br />
Any rogues with more resources than lil ol me willing to experiment? :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Varillian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And there is still the possibility of an old poison with a new alternate recipe.</div></div><hr />

We are told there are undiscovered recipies (by way of the fan faire trade skill forum). <br />
<br />
Any undiscovered recipes are likely to be alternate recipes to existing known poisons.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem is that SoE gave us no clues for any poison recipes.  Once we had found a recipe or two for all of the known poison effects, we stopped looking; it is simply more efficient for us, in terms of time, to gather ingredients for known poisons than combine random ingredients together in hope for a new recipe to reveal itself.</div></div><hr />
