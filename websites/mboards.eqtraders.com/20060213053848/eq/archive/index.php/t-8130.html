I think we're having a marinated grilled chicken salad with mexicali ranch dressing for dinner tonight, so I will likely be eating in front of the computer (yay, me!)  Dinertime is a wonderful time to do imbues!</div></div><hr />

I don't tend to do many for others, since I had so many to do for myself, but can do a few stacks now and again.</div></div><hr />

Lately I've been getting on earlier, say around 8:00 EDT.  Just drop em off, sit back and relax, and I'll give a call when your order is ready   :D</div></div><hr />

Mid-20's -- two nights in Paludal Caverns oughtta do it.  I have a 23 shammy that could group with you.  One or two others, and we take a hill at B1, and listen for the dings!</div></div><hr />

I've been trying to field all the pebble requests, since those of you that can do emeralds could pretty much imbue around the clock and never get through all the requests!   ;)</div></div><hr />
