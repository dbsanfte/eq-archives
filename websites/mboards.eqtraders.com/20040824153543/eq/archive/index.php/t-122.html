<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My skill is 151.<br />
<br />
I used to fish alot, but recently, it takes so long to get a skillup that I just plain get bored. Last time, it took an hour of dedicated fishing to get just 1 skillup.<br />
<br />
Does it always take this long, or gasp - does it get harder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebyen Trueheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, that's a good question. I'm kinda new to fishing myself, only have a skill for 78 right now, only took it up for the fish out of seb needed for the crubile of escape. Wanting to get it to 200, but if it's like you describe, that'll be a long time in coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yalum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the 170s it was taking me 5 stacks of bait per skill up on average.  That's when I broke down and bought my way to 200 at the guild trainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Healblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've found that I got skillups faster when I just fished a few minutes here and there.  good to do when waiting on someone, waiting on a spawn, etc.  Just remember to have fun with it, after all:<br />
<br />
Tradeskills ;)  - Fun :D  = Torture :twisted:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tnexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Towards the end it was taking about 50-100 baits per skillup. Best bet is to go to Cobalt Scar and fish Cobalt Scar. That way you can make some cash at least doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Knek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some have it easier than others. Took me 12 hours of fishing (not all at once) in Plane of Storms (catching salmon for my baking) to go from 198 to 200. Granted, my wisdom was very low as I wasn't aiming for skillups and didn't don my spiffy wisdom gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gemia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I finally got my fishing to 183 (Yay!) and it will not budge another point. My wisdom is nearly maxed, yet I have spent hours and countless stacks of bait to no avail. It has taken me more time working on point 184 than it took from 120-183.  :cry:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaylya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got from 75ish to 200 fishing for Iceclad Cutlassfish for 7th shawl (Whatever it's called) and for Saltwater Seaweed for smithing skill. I never fished with the intent of raising skill; its like baking for me (Well, after I got the skill for the 3rd shawl or whatever) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tanaysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I must confess a couple of embarrassing things..... :oops: <br />
<br />
One&gt; I have paid for and used KEI strictly to get fishing skillups. <br />
<br />
Two&gt; you can use points at your guild hall to raise fishing, all the way to skill level 200.<br />
<br />
 :roll: <br />
<br />
Happy Fishing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Knochi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yesterday, 5 stacks of bait and the odd foraged fishing grub brought me from 189 to 190.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trakeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I didn't want to spend a ton of plat on fishing so I raised it with casts.  I'm sure I went through 100+ stacks of bait from 190 to 200.  I could go through a stack of bait and only get 2 or 3 fish, between 193 and 198, and the rest got wasted on rusty daggers and sandals...<br />
<br />
No clue on how many times I fell asleep at the keyboard fishing.  Lots of hours heh.  I wouldn't feel to bad Tanaysa, I've bought KEI for fishing as well :)<br />
<br />
Well this post just seems to be a messed up ramble so I'll stop.[/url]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ghratch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wasnt a big fisherman till PoP came out I had done some here an there mainly when campin Gornit but since the release of PoP i find myself fishing in PoT while looking for a group. Since I hit about 150 the skill ups seem to take forever before seemed about ever 10 casts or so now its more like ever 100. /shrug <br />
<br />
Just this Trolls 2 cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>illovich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, it's true those last 30 skill points are hard won... I usually try to combine fishing and foraging, except in cobalt scar where I don't care fo the forages.  I guess you could call me a fishiger.<br />
<br />
I like to fishige in the Plane of Growth (where the fishiging is frustrating...no special fish, and I only want planar oak), and eastern Karana where I can get thunder salmon, tea leaves and plains pebbles all in one place. I wish cobalt cod could be fishiged in EK too...then i'd forget about growth and just fishige there.<br />
<br />
If you have bard envy, you can fishige and grind those underdeveloped casting spells....fishigicasting. drag a few spell gems to your hotkes next to you fishing and foraging buttons, maybe put in a sit/stand key if you don't want to pay for kei (or really have bard envy), and suddenly you're a glowing firework of a fishigicaster. <br />
<br />
note to non-woodelf melees and others who can't do the above: I'm really sorry. Not everyone can be a fishigicaster. If you're a bard, give your fingers a break and just fishige.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sedistik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All of my 177 levels of fishing have come, while enchanting vials or metals. It used to come in rather fast, but after 170, it takes 5 stacks of bait to get a level up now.<br />
<br />
Course, if I was at 200, I would not know what to do while medding in-between enchanting. I might have to go work on brewing or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Baltin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I concur the last 20 points or so where extrememly slow .. 5 or so stacks of Bait ( 100 catches) per point ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dorothy Ozland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmm thats odd.  I get about a skill up about every 25 baits.  Currently my skill is 185.  I plan on skilling up the rest in OOT for that seaweed instead of paying for the skillups.  Two birds with one stone is how I kinda see it.    :mrgreen:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Also seeing very slow increase after lvl 150 - but pretty consistent and not getting worse in the 170's.   Was wondering if we know for certain it is based on INT/WIS - all I seem to notice is that when my strength is buffed and I am a bit above the water I break my poles a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Was wondering if we know for certain it is based on INT/WIS<br />
Hehe, is there *anything* about tradeskills that we know for certain?  I'm pretty sure they have never mentioned any other stat having an influence of fishing.  <br />
<br />
And yes, it's verrrrry slow for the last 50 points or so.  Don't forget that fishing is level capped in the same way that spell casting and melee skills are:  <br />
<br />
max fishing skill = (lvl + 1) * 5 ... up to the hard cap of 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Araon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oddest thing about Fishing is that I don't think I am looking forward to hitting the 200 cap.  187 is getting uncomfortably close....<br />
<br />
No more skill ups means one less thing to look forward to when casting out that line, after all  :) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Temperance EM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I did spend a lot of time fishing just for skill's sake.<br />
But in the end I figured I wouldn't fish unless I have a reason.<br />
( backwards from real life . . . )<br />
<br />
I went to Cobalt Scar with 40 stacks of bait and 4 fishing poles.<br />
Cast all the bait, did a lot of foraging. Ended up leaving with<br />
almost as many stacks fish &amp; food as bait I carried in with me.<br />
<br />
Not something to do just for skills sake anymore, but I will<br />
spend time with my little alts every few levels while they<br />
practice their casting skills or sense heading or sneak, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pappee Gnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Something you might try is other things involved with fishing besides uh... fishing.  <br />
<br />
http://eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_fishing.htm<br />
<br />
Alot of the Fillet's trivial around 170's, maybe some higher...<br />
Blessed fishing rod Trivials over 200....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>javalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">takes me about 200+ casts per bump skill 191 now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">With 250 WIS, it was taking about 45 min of non-stop fishing to get a skillup between 190 and 195.  When I had gotten enough fish to do the Fisherman's Companion quest for me and lots of  friends, I spent a couple hundred plat to buy the remaining points from a trainer.  It's not worth the time investment to get 200 fishing by fishing.. Spend the plat and farm stuff instead and you'll still be ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Qallainx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well... I did a lot of soloing in CS when I was in my 50's...  It was either just sit there bored and med, or else fish, beg pet and med...  :D <br />
<br />
PS: My begging is at 191... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dragnet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As far as I know the only high trivial combine that you are likely to want is for the blessed fishing rod.<br />
<br />
Evidence from this forum (and personal experience) suggests that the success rate is already very high (maybe 95%) at around 180 skill.<br />
<br />
Personally I am at 180 skill and I fish when I feel like it. I guess eventually I will hit 200. I don't see the big rush unless some new profitable and hard recipe comes along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Honestly, fishing is as boring as they can come.<br />
<br />
But there are times when you can work on it and have the time go by (other than tacklebox recipies)..<br />
<br />
As a rogue, I get intimidation.  Find a corpse (player pref) anywhere, or target an NPC that will NOT go near you and practice it.<br />
<br />
Sence heading, too.  Sence traps, also!<br />
<br />
And for Rangers / Druids, Foraging (Wood Elves just to get the zone specific forages)...<br />
<br />
If your baking is below 82, then stack up on sauses and make fish fillets out of your catches, or if its below 122, stack up on batwings and make fishrolls.<br />
<br />
I love to fish in Ocean of Tears.  Gunthank Mackeral are there, that plus a skinning knife in a tacklebox yields 5 bait.  Sometimes you can sell the seaweed for 5PP+ and the marr cherries go quickly at the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Don't forget fletching supplies for the fletchers and tailoring supplies for the tailors.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget to ask your friends and/or guild if they need any zone specific foraging / catches.<br />
<br />
Yes, fishing is borning, but if you keep yourself occupied the time can pass quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dagmar Darkwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yes, I'm obsessive completist and nothing short of 200 will do.  After 15 stacks of bait (and three poles) I've gone from 191 to 195.  What's a fishing druid to do?  Buy more bait and keep foraging grubs, of course.  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>blewstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm still a little confused is it str or wisdom that can move the skill up faster? My ranger has 229 str and 100 wisdom. Would think str could be used as warriors don't use wisdom and may not be able to use all the wis gear out there. <br />
<br />
Any help appreciated blew</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">went into Sebilis today to try for some Kunzar Koi for a fellow guildmate. Brought 1 pole, 60 bait. Started at 88 skill, ended up at 109 skill. Caught 10 Kunzar Koi, starting at 97 and 99. Took about 40 minutes, and my INT was 200.</div></div><hr />
