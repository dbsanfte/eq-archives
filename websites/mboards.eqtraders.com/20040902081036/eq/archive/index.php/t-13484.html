<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Curian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to finish up my pottery to 250 (220 atm, with Aid Grimel completed). I am a HIE Mage of Mith Marr. any suggestions as to my approach? Money is always an issue, but I do know that you have to spend to skill up. Thanks for the advice folks.</div></div><hr />

Take some time to read this forum.<br />

Make some steins, ceramic rings, and finish up with idols.  All this information has been posted countless times here.</div></div><hr />

unfired opal encrusted steins to 222<br />
unfired white ceramic bands to 231<br />
unfired crucibles of escape to 236<br />
unfired idols of tunare to 242<br />
unfired star ruby encrusted steins to 250She fired all the steins and ceramic bands and is slowly selling them off in the Bazaar.  I would guess that at this point, the star ruby encrusted stein sales have paid for her skill-ups.<br />
<br />
There were some bad spots when she thought she wasn't ever going to get another skill-up point.  But looking back at her records for 200 to 250, she actually averaged approximately 30 combinations per skill-up.<br />
<br />
It really helps if you know an enchanter who is willing to enchant all those vials of mana; a priest that can imbue the gems; and a jeweler to lacquer gems.<br />

Sorry for my original answer... bad commute into work this morning because of the snow.</div></div><hr />
