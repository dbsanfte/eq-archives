<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is a summary of the discussions that took place about Tradeskill super-trophies at the Fan Faire.  I passed these by Maddoc again, and he asked me to remind folks that while the concept is under discussion, it's not guaranteed to happen.  This is just something they're considering, not something they've promised us.  It could very well never make it into the game.<br />
<br />
At one of the tradeskill panels, I mentioned the idea of a tradeskill super-trophy, and the devs asked to discuss it with me after the panel.  We met up shortly afterwards and brainstormed some ideas.<br />
<br />
For your reference, here's the original question as I sent it to the devs.<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to add some kind of super trophy for multi-tradeskill GM's?  Here are some ideas on what could be done in this vein.<br />
 A tradeskill super-trophy is defined as a trophy you can only obtain once you have all seven tradeskill trophies (excluding alchemy, poison making, tinkering, and research), or one that requires 250 in all seven general tradeskills, or both.<br />
 One possibility is a combine that requires all seven trophies plus some other item, yielding back six normal trophies and one super trophy with increased stats or abilities.  <br />
 Another option is for a no-fail combine of all seven trophies in a quest container to yield the super-trophy.  The super-trophy could be combined by itself in a forge to yield a no-drop, no-rent, lore item with a bonus to smithing; it could be combined in a tailoring kit or loom to yield a tailoring-boosting item, and so on.<br />
 Perhaps this super trophy could allow the wielder to exceed the 252 cap on tradeskills -- if it were a 10% mod for a 250 tradeskiller, the wielder's effective skill would be 275 rather than 252.  <br />
 Another popular option is to have the super-trophy reduce fail rates, much like the enchanter Jewel Crafting Mastery AA.  This reduces enchanters' lock on one tradeskill while still giving them an advantage -- the super-trophy requires being a GM in all seven tradeskills, whereas enchanters can get the same benefit purely with AA's.<br />
 Alternately, a single super-trophy with multiple tradeskill mods on it would also be nice.<br />
<br />
The developers didn't seem to be against the idea of a tradeskill super-trophy.  Rather, they seemed to question the need for and value of it.  In short, what value would it bring to the game?  We discussed a few ideas on how to make it popular for tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
First, we discussed what it could and could not do.  Probably the most requested feature is some way to increase tradeskill levels beyond a modified 252 or reduce failures like the Jewel Crafting Mastery AA.  I proposed both these ideas, but it turns out that going past 252 on a tradeskill would require some significant recoding to the game, and the JCM ability cannot be turned into an item ability or a buff that could be placed as a clicky on the super-trophy.  Personally, I would much rather have one of these two abilities than any other on a super trophy, but I understand that it's much easier to work within the existing system rather than push for major changes.<br />
<br />
Once we had gotten past that idea, we looked at what else could be done with the super trophy.  The idea of changing existing trophies to yield different 100% WR bags has been bounced around a bit, but it seemed the devs were not too happy at having to create multiple different 100% WR bags (one per trophy) and then modify the existing trophies and quests to accommodate them.  Instead, we discussed allowing the super-trophy to summon a new, non-lore 100% WR bag.  That would allow you to summon up to eight 100% WR bags from the super-trophy.  This would only require the creation of one new bag, and the existing trophies would not be changed.<br />
<br />
Of course, tradeskillers would want some form of tradeskill mod on the super-trophy.  Again, it's not possible to have multiple tradeskill mods on one item without lots of new coding, but we did discuss a few ideas on how to achieve this within the existing game.  One person suggested creating seven super-trophies, and right-clicking on each one would consume it and summon the next in the sequence (sort of like the Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=11668); when you right-click the gauntlets, you get a Vibrating Hammer of Infuse (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=11669), and you can right-click that to get back the gauntlets).  The devs seemed to find this idea unnecessarily complex.  Instead, the idea I suggested above (of placing the trophy alone in a tradeskill container and combining to get back the trophy plus a no-drop, no-rent, lore item with a mod for that tradeskill) seemed much more to their liking.  The nature of the mod is still open for debate, but it's safe to assume it would be at least 5% like the existing trophies.  Again, I would wish for something a bit more dramatic, but I'm not sure what we could do without major coding.<br />
<br />
This brings us to the stats on the super-trophy.  Maddoc seemed to be happy with doubling the stats on a normal trophy, which currently has STR: +10 CHA: +50 WIS: +10 INT: +10.  I would personally be much happier if the super-trophy also added something to all stats, plus some HP, mana, and resists.  That would make it more attractive to players of all classes, and more likely to be equipped all the time.  (Compare the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl, which is arguably easier to achieve than all seven trophies.)  Since you can equip three normal trophies at once for stats (one each in primary, secondary, and range), giving up seven trophies for just double the stats of one original seems a bit miserly.<br />
<br />
These ideas weren't fleshed out too much at the Fan Faire, and Maddoc specifically requested that I post my ideas and what we discussed here for more feedback.  So, what do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thank you for posting all this, it was a very interesting read.<br />
<br />
The thing about the stats.... yes we may be able to equip 3 trophies, but i think the devs may be right about not wanting to triple the stats.... a single item with 30wis/int, a little too powerful.<br />
<br />
Double the stats sounds ok, but yes i would also like to see some resist, hp/mana to make it a usefull device.<br />
<br />
I had another idea that i posted a while back, put an instant click self only Charisma buff on it.  It wouldnt be too powerful, but mean a person in tradeskill gear wouldnt have to swap to charisma gear to buy/sell.  And also a self only insta click buff is a usefull game item.  See Gobby skull earing, 10th ring.  This would be the bonus reward of having finally made it to the super trophie.<br />
<br />
I also had an idea similar to this one here - (of placing the trophy alone in a tradeskill container and combining to get back the trophy plus a no-drop, no-rent, lore item with a mod for that tradeskill)   <br />
But i didnt think about putting it in on its own... mine was to combine it with something that is linked to that skill -<br />
<br />
Smithing - small piece of ore<br />
Pottery - small piece of clay<br />
JC - silver bar<br />
Simply, a cheap vendor sold item that is easy to get.<br />
<br />
Only thing to think about is the resulting mod item (the no rent one) will have to be equiped so it could do with having some stats???  Unless you take the Super Trophie stats to ballence out having to equip the Mod item with no stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I was the one who suggested the vibrating gauntlets idea. Id reallty just prefer to have some sort of universal tool to free up bank space. IE smithing hammer/chisel/file all in one, fletching whittling knife, planing tool etc. Carrying this junk around is annoying.<br />
<br />
For the super trophy to have any real value to be worn at all times, it needs both HP, mana, and preferrably a FT/regen + ATTK mod on it. Very few mid to end game players are willing to equip an item with no hp/mana/resists on it at the very least.<br />
<br />
The WR bags would be nice. I'm always destroying 2 bags when I do alchemy, and it would be nice to have persistant (ie, not no rent) versions to replace them with for ldons.<br />
<br />
Basically the item would be for bragging rights. Unless the components are on par with the &quot;Aid Grimmel&quot; quest earring to get (and I am fine with this), it should be limited in raw stat value. It would be nice if it held interest to those of us in elementals and beyond of course.</div></div><hr />

Unless you take the Super Trophie stats to ballence out having to equip the Mod item with no stats.Perhaps the No Rent mod items could have the same stats as a regular Trophy: 10str/wis/int 50cha.  Would allow you to make only identical sacrifices you would have to in terms of the original trophy, and its not like they're giving you somthing you wouldn't have had access to originally - afterall, you did have 7 of the things before you made the super-trophy (assuming, of course, that they are consumed in making it).</div></div><hr />

Totally against this one. If it's for tradeskilling, then perhaps int/wis bonuses out the ying/yang, or some of the other stats that are used in specific tradeskills, but no atk, no ft/regen, or anything like that.  It's not supposed to be an uber item for fighting, it's for tradeskilling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Speaking of trophies, was a trophy for Spell Research ever mentioned?<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

It's not supposed to be an uber item for fighting, it's for tradeskilling.I was almost dissappointed when I looted a nice range item, as that ment I could no longer justify leaving my Grandmaster Smith's Hammer permanently equipped.  I am a smith, and I would like to make that plain and obvious.  I avoided upgrading from Fine Plate for as long as I could.  Originally, I only took off my Old Cultural armor when I could replace it with New Cultural (eventually the rest did get upgraded, too).  Even now I'm avoiding small but easy-to-get upgrades, just so I can keep wearing my self-made blue diamond armor.  Wearing symbols of my craft means something to me.  I can't do that anymore with my GM Trophy - the sacrifices are too big.  It'd be wonderful if the Super-Trophy could.  Something with &quot;decent&quot; stats, so that it wouldn't be too unreasonable to actually leave it equipped.  Something to show off continually and be proud of.<br />
<br />
Ideally, it would be something nice enough to be &quot;respectable&quot;, but not good enough so that people would do tradeskills just to get it - this is probably an impossible combination, but it's still what I would like :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brickhaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Quichon and Dunthor - I want the super trophy to be useful for tradeskills primarily. I don't care about hps/mana/saves/etc on my trophies. I use them for Primary Stat (to boost my total for skillups), Cha (to buy cheaper/sell higher) and Str (to carry more). Something on the order of +25 to Wis/Int/Str and +100 Cha (to help those tradeskillers penalized with a very low starting Cha). I can see an argument for adding Dex as well.<br />
<br />
The primary thing the super trophy needs to be able to do is general +5% tradeskill items at will. The combine in a container to produce the trophy plus a +5% item is a GREAT idea. Only one slot for 7 geerloks - sign me up:)<br />
<br />
The idea of no-drop, but NOT no-rent or no-lore 100% WT bags from the trophy is a very useful idea as well. Especially for those who like to smith:)<br />
<br />
I am NOT 1750 yet, but I am making my trophies as I go along. Why? Because I want to...I like to know that I've finished a tradeskill and for me, the trophy is the expression of that goal. I want the super trophy to reflect the same ideals as why I enjoy tradeskills in the first place, not to be some uber piece of equipment that high end players will covet. Aid Grimmel sounds like a fun quest... but for those of us not in high end quilds, it's more a fantasy than reality.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Quesci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The problem with many of the suggestions for the super tradeskill trophy is that many of them won't be much help if you can actually get the trophy.<br />
<br />
We don't need more than the 5% that the trophy gives us--in fact, at 250 skill we don't even need 1% skill modifier to make 252.  I guess it would be useful for people who made their trophies earlier than 240, but how many of us would support a super tradeskill trophy for people below 240 anyway?<br />
<br />
Adding INT/WIS would be nice for some, but only if you are going to keep it equipped 24/7.  The INT/WIS isn't going to be useful for skilling up--again, by the time you get this super trophy you are at max skill.  If you increase the stats so that they are useful for average players to keep equipped, then it is disaproportionately useful for certain classes--why should some classes get a very useful trophy while for others it is not something to keep equipped?<br />
<br />
Honestly, at this point I'd settle for a super trophy that wasn't much different from my other trophies, even just to get the room in my bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A Tradeskill trophy does not need any huge stats, there is already to many people involved for the wrong reasons. Since prices are capped at cha 104 and skillups dont matter once u have all skills up, there is almost no gain for real skillers above the 50 Cha on normal trophy.<br />
<br />
I'd like the idea of a form of universal geerlok to clean up space, but it would benefit 240'ers (me) more then 250'ers. I dont see where the rotation type would be problematic coding, other then adding 7 summon spells with component and 7 new items. The feature already is in game (warrior Epic).<br />
<br />
Another useful option would be a nodrop, not lore, not norent summoned bag. Add 100% coin reduction and it is one of the most useful things I can think off, but the last option will attract non-skillers again.<br />
<br />
Gate Abysmal Sea ? Any cast time will be better then the half hour boat rotation.<br />
<br />
Lastly I would settle for something fun, Illusion halfling female, or a title, or ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aruvqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would love to have a single trophy that is unique, that you have to go to a quest npc [like a grimel type person] where you turn in your trophies and get a single one back. I would also like to see it that you could get 1 grandmaster permanent bag per trophy for a total of the number of regular GM trophies. I know that sort of leaves out the racial or class specific tradeskills...<br />
<br />
I also love the idea that you could combine this uber trophy in a tradeskill container with a tradeskill ingredient and get a univeral tool so you wouldnt have to keep different hammers, files, chisels, planing tools, skinning knives, nonstick skillets and the like. That alone would free up serious bank space for me=)<br />
<br />
And I have to laugh at the idea that chanters have the lock on jewelcraft....JC was my first 250 skill as a cleric=) &lt;smithing is going to be number 2&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just a thought on this &quot;universal tool&quot; idea....<br />
<br />
That would mean that every single recipe that has a tool, would need to be edited by the dev in question... and that is no small task... a HUGE amount of work you are asking for.<br />
 <br />
I am not saying either way on wether or not the dev should do this much work, just indicating you you guys that it will take that much work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Auricula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ngreth said: First, we discussed what it could and could not do.

<br />
How about the reverse?  One you are at 1750 you are able to trade in either the current Tradeskill Trophies or even a Super Trophy for a new JCM3-type AA that would be available to ALL classes ... something along the lines of the free AA and STATS you can get by being flagged for PoP zones?  Even limit it to being able to do it only once so you have to chose which single tradeskill you would like to reduce failure rates in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice enough to *who* Dunthor?  Someone still wearing BD cultural?  Someone in ornate? Fully elemental?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Carnilion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think that the mutli-tool would work (whether it was the super-trophy or not) if the devs made a new recipe for each tool that included the multi-tool, some cheap components (ie water, stackable ore/clay, spices) and something that costs a little like a celestial essence or a perl so that you can't sell the item back for more than it took to make.  There would have to be a different recipe for each tool, which could get cumbersome, but with the new tradeskill interface at least you wouldn't have to memorize all of them.<br />
<br />
Examples would be:<br />
<br />
File <br />
Multi-Tool<br />
Celestial Essence<br />
Water x 2<br />
<br />
Dairy Spoon<br />
Multi-Tool<br />
Celestial Essence<br />
Water x 3<br />
Frosting x 2<br />
<br />
If you don't like the idea of making the celestial essences, then maybe use a gem that costs about the same.  I would just hope that it would be something fairly easy to get and most of the recipes use the same thing so you don't have to carry around too many components.  Carrying a stack of celestial essences and the multi-tool sounds much better than 2 backpacks full of tools.  The other components would have to be commonly available everywhere (such as water) or at least to the tradeskill vendors (ie frosting) but it would be best to use as few different components as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cubwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Problem with that idea is it'll create hundreds of new recipes (hence a more work for devs) for just a very small population of players.<br />

Ain't gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it would just be one new recipy for each tool.<br />
<br />
Provided the recipy was almost the same for all tools you could carry a stack of the &quot;costs pp&quot; item and make the tools as you need them.<br />
<br />
Not a bad idea, but not exactly a solution either.</div></div><hr />

If you needed to make different tools, how is that different from making or buying the tool you need when you need it? I know I've made a lot of baking implements because someone.... borrowed one and I need a pot. So I grab some molds and make a pot and bake.  If you skill in PoK everything is there, so no savings to use a multi-tool like you suggest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Perhaps a simpler thing for these to do is to summon a &quot;collapsible kit,&quot; like the tinkered items do. This would require no heartache on the part of the devs, as the bags already exist, and it would allow us all to start cleaning bank space.   <br />
<br />
hehe, on an unrealistic note, wouldn't be nice if the super trophies allowed us to play chanter and had clickable &quot;Clarify Mana&quot; on the pottery one =). <br />
<br />

totally agree with kiztent, the point here is to SAVE SPACE, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If the idea is just to conserve bag space, how about this?<br />
<br />
Designate up to ten tools for one tradeskill as the kit.  The selection of tools is hard-coded and cannot be changed by the players in-game.<br />
<br />
You obtain these items normally (i.e., buy them or make them).  In a toolbox, combine all the items and get back a &quot;portable workbench&quot; token, or a &quot;portable kitchen kit&quot; token, or whatever.  You can right-click the token to summon the original tools, consuming the token in the process.<br />
<br />
This solution would save on bank storage space, and it would make it easier to carry your kit along with you.  If the token-creating combine is doable in a collapsible toolkit, you can even re-compress the items on the road.  In one deluxe or collapsible toolkit, you could carry up to ten tradeskill kits -- or nine kits and a collapsible toolkit, if you prefer.  You break them out and combine them back as needed.  Since the tokens cannot be made without actually having the items beforehand, there's no risk of free plat.  You could even sell the toolkits in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how this could be tied to the super-trophy, though.  Maybe require the super-trophy to be part of the combine to make the token?  (The super-trophy would be returned with the token, of course.)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I think this idea could stand alone -- tie this to the normal trophies instead.  People have been clamoring for some extra incentive to make the various trophies; this could be it.  Place up to nine tools and the matching trophy in a toolkit, combine, and get back the trophy and the portable kit token.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If the idea is just to conserve bag space, how about this?<br />
<br />
The problem is no body knows what the idea is.  This is just people throwing around half... baked ideas that &quot;would be cool&quot; without thinking about what it really means at all, either from a server/programming perspective or a player perspective.<br />
<br />
Which is why I think these super trophy or multi tool discussions are ill conceived at best.</div></div><hr />

The only difference is that instead of trying to find all of the ingredients and dealing with subcombines, you would know that all you need is water, a celestial essence and possibly one other (easily obtainable) item.  I admit that my suggestion could be a little too complicated to make it worthwhile, though I think it would be better than nothing.  <br />
<br />
I like KyrosKrane's suggestion for the simplicity of it.  I would be interested to get a count of the &quot;common&quot; tools needed for each tradeskill to see if the limit of 9 or 10 would be very restrictive.  The only concern I have for the Toolbox method is that if you wanted one tool, you would have to sacrifice an inventory slot for the toolbox while you were doing your combines.  You can't destroy anything to make room because you will need it again to collapse the toolbox.<br />
<br />
I like the idea though, and I think it would be better than what we have now.  Especially for when we aren't tradeskillin'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know where all the vendors are for the tools I need in pok, either to buy them or make them.  If I don't remember quickly, I can check the site here.<br />
<br />
Unless... are you suggesting that there be a vendor for the multi-tool base components?  In which case, I'd say no.<br />

I would be interested to get a count of the &quot;common&quot; tools needed for each tradeskill to see if the limit of 9 or 10 would be very restrictive.  The only concern I have for the Toolbox method is that if you wanted one tool, you would have to sacrifice an inventory slot for the toolbox while you were doing your combines.  You can't destroy anything to make room because you will need it again to collapse the toolbox.<br />
<br />
Well... what about... corking devices? woks? crab crackers? shears?<br />
<br />
I know I have more than 10 baking implements, there's 4 hammers (or 3 depending on race) for smithing plus a file.  Outside of corking devices I can't think of anything for brewing, tailoring doesn't have any tools outside of shears (2), fletching's tools are consumed on success (and if you can summon those you ought to be able to summon em studded chains), pottery using sculpting tools and neither tinkering nor poison making have any tools.<br />
<br />
Is it *really* worth developers time to make life easier for the people with 1750 skill that want to bake for profit?  Both of them?<br />
<br />
Maybe if they fixed the PoP temper requirement smiths would care about getting a new tanaan hammer.  As it is now, we can't do PoP combines often enough anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The only trade really problematic on tools for me is baking. Baking really is a toolhog, and most of the tools used in it are pretty cheap. Things like muffin tins, cake rounds, dairy spoon and so on. Perhaps it would be more useful to seperate baking tools into two categories: cheap commons and expensives.<br />
<br />
I know I'd hardly consider a wok something I use a lot, not like the other items, so it's stored away on a mule until I need it. Same for crab crackers and frying pans. Although the frying pans are cheaper to replace. Dairy spoons I go through like socks, pots I make and lose as I go as well. Cake rounds I try to keep, but again a cheap easy one to replace if mine gets lost.<br />
<br />
It's a pity there's no /toolbelt command where tools get flagged like keys do to your keyring. Would be nice to be able to buy that one commonly used cheap tool, /toolbelt it to have it consumed but added to your belt and then instead of checking just your inventory on combines it would also check your toolbelt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are more tools than that. First of all, baking ones are more than 10. I just don't remember them all.<br />
<br />
For smithing, there are 4 hammers (including one for High Elf), plus hammer and anvil for the Vah Shir smithing quest, Chistle and File. <br />
<br />
For brewing Corking Device and Cyclops Skull are the only ones that I can think of. <br />
<br />
For Tailoring, there are two shears, two needles (embroidery and tanaan embroidery), High Elf LoY needle (different one for each race) and I am pretty sure there are old cultural needles as well, like for Wood Elves and Halfling? <br />
<br />
As for Fleching, there is a Planing Tool as well as Whittling Blade and Steel Working Knife. Fishbone Dart Tool is rarely used but still a tool.<br />
<br />
Pottery indeed has Sculpting Tools. <br />
<br />
These are what I can just think of off the top of my head. I am sure there are more. So, as a 1750 club member, almost 1/4 of my bank spaces are taken up by my tools for tradeskills. I am forced to create alts just to hold the tools and rare items I need to collect. Of course some of the items are no drop, like Vah Shir hammer/anvil, so I have to keep them on me. I am definitely in favor of reducing number of tools needed for tradeskills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>AnnaaDruid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am very much against the idea of a super trophy requiring any items from the high end game.  I am almost a 1750 tradeskillker (just need a few more points in smithing) and I did it because I love tradeskills, not because of things like the Grimel earring.  Which, by the way, is an item I can't get, because I don't have the flags, because I prefer to spend my time tradeskilling rather than advancing through the planes.  The super trophy should not be linked to how good your guild is.  It should be about how dedicated you are to tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
That said, we have to look at what benefits COULD come from the trophy.  Skill mods wouldn't much help the people who can get the super trophy, we are already maxed.  So, I like the idea of letting the trophy be a good piece of adventuring gear, to make up for the time that all of us spent in front of hot ovens, forges, kilns, etc instead of out adventuring and looting nice items.<br />
<br />
It could be something along the lines of the Grimel earring, where you can get choices of a melee, caster, or hybrid version of the super trophy.  All would have some resists and stats, with different effects for each version, like some mana regen for the caster version.  Then, allow us to use it to get another permanent WR bag, and allow it to create an item that does have skills mods.  Like combining it in a forge with a hammer to return a 10% mod no drop no rent hammer and the super trophy.<br />

<br />
The stats aspect of the trophy other then being used as a real item, as opposed to a tool, IE the need for mana HP,  is a bit off, if you are a 1750, or even a 1640 with the shears, an XTC hammer, and gearloks  Stats for skilling up are  not really an issue.<br />

<br />
Hail the guy in Bazaar for a container. Combine 7 trophies + [Celestial Master's Seal] for the Celestial Master's Trophy. Celestial Master's Seal is like the Grandmasters but needs Valorium/other type of metal/gems to make. Make it low Planar drops.<br />
<br />
Now you have a nice stat item which summons No Drop 100% WR bags. Stats along the lines of:<br />
<br />
STR +15<br />
STA +10<br />

AUG +10<br />
INT/WIS +15<br />
CHA +75<br />
HP/Mana/End + 50<br />
PR/DR/FR/CR +10<br />
MR +15<br />
<br />
Nice stats but not obscene. <br />
<br />
Now in every TS Container add 8 recipes. This will either combine a trophy into that container's TS Specific trophy (with +5% mod) or the TS Specific trophy into the basic one. TS Specific may have less stats but more specific for that tradeskill. <br />
<br />
Also maybe add Regen/Atk/FT on the TS Specific trophies depending on which one it is. But these ones don't summon bags.</div></div><hr />

But with the new UI you pick the end product and the UI would then have to determine if you had that tool on your 'belt'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It's a pity there's no /toolbelt command where tools get flagged like keys do to your keyring.

<br />
That's brilliant!  :D <br />
<br />
And yes - the point of asking for a multitool is to save space.  Baking is definitely the worst space hog of all the skills, so even if they just did it for baking it would help A LOT. <br />
<br />
But the /toolbelt idea...I love it!  Plus, cultural tools could be &quot;belt-able&quot; whereas i an actual item or kit was created, cultural tools would probably not be included in said item/kit.<br />
<br />
Ps:  it might also be less complex to code.  Use code from the already existing /keyring to create the /toolbelt.  Then, instead of modifying or adding  recipes to include new tools, modify the check at the combine level to add a check for the required tool on the /toolbelt as well as the tradeskiller’s inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>JMorgana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Personally, I LOVE the idea of a /toolbelt command, or even better, something like the keyring setup where the minute you use a tool not already on your toolbelt it automatically adds it and displays a message stating just that.  This is by FAR my favorite idea in this thread and it doesn't even directly relate to the super-trophy concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Meryddian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ok first off - about tradeskill thingies (already in game or not) summoning bags - I have bags out the yin-yang. Tink bags are 5k, there's all kinds of WR bags that either drop or are tailor-made now (haversacks, GoD bags etc) - not to mention I already have 7 trophies in my bag that summon bags - so the idea of something that summons another bag just does not do a single thing for me at all. Why does a tradeskill trophy have to DO anything like summon a bag or tools? Think about it: in real life, trophies are simply things that sit on your bookcase/mantle/whatever and look pretty. <br />
<br />
However, that being said.............. Becoming a non-modified 1750 takes a TREMENDOUS effort and commitment from a player. Even with the new UI, there is just simply a huge, huge, HUGE timesink (and moneysink) required to farm the materials and do all the thousands and thousands of combines necessary to reach that skill level. (There IS a reason that you cannot buy all the materials to get 250 in each tradeskill from vendors).  <br />
<br />
This brings us to the stats on the super-trophy. Maddoc seemed to be happy with doubling the stats on a normal trophy, which currently has STR: +10 CHA: +50 WIS: +10 INT: +10. I would personally be much happier if the super-trophy also added something to all stats, plus some HP, mana, and resists. That would make it more attractive to players of all classes, and more likely to be equipped all the time.  <br />
<br />
Now, the Aid Grimel quest yields the following:<br />
<br />
Signet of the Arcane (casters/priests)<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
Slot: EAR<br />
AC: 25<br />
STR: +25 DEX: +25 STA: +25 WIS: +25 INT: +25 AGI: +25 HP: +130 MANA: +150<br />
SV FIRE: +15 SV DISEASE: +15 SV COLD: +15 SV MAGIC: +15 SV POISON: +15<br />
Mana Regeneration: +3<br />
Focus: Preservation of Xegony <br />
<br />
Signet of Might (hybrid/melees)<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
Slot: EAR<br />
AC: 25<br />
Skill Mod: Dodge +8%<br />
STR: +25 DEX: +25 STA: +25 WIS: +25 INT: +25 AGI: +25 HP: +145 MANA: +130 ENDUR: +130<br />
SV FIRE: +15 SV DISEASE: +15 SV COLD: +15 SV MAGIC: +15 SV POISON: +15<br />
Attack: +30<br />
Regeneration: +3  <br />
<br />
A couple things need to be pointed out.<br />
<br />
1) You need to be at least level 51 to do the Aid Grimel quest, because you need to spend AA's to get it and therefore you need to be of a level to earn AA's.<br />
<br />
2) You need to be Elemental flagged, or at least have real nice friends who are willing to help get you into the EPs to loot a Hope Stone. (not to mention all the flags you need before that)<br />
<br />
Which means, if you're 51+ and non-EP, you might be able to get yourself one of the lower-level earrings in the AG quest, but otherwise, at best, you only have the tradeskill trophies - which, if you're lucky, you can manage to combine at levels far below 250.<br />
<br />
So basically, right now, the BEST reward(s) in the game for the time/energy/cost involved in becoming a 1750 are limited to those who are EP flagged - and while granted that % of the population is growing, how many mains who are under 65 do you know who are?<br />
<br />
Also let's point out the following item which is the result of a &quot;quest&quot;, the only part of the &quot;quest&quot; being that you loot the essence off AHR in VT and turn it in to some guy in Umbral. No skill required whatsoever to get what is if not the best, then one of the best, neck items in the game:<br />
<br />
Talisman of Vah Kerrath  <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 0.4 Size: TINY <br />
Slot: NECK  <br />
Effect: Blessing of Kerrath: Ultravision<br />

Classes: All Classes  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
<br />
Personally, I would LOVE to see something like the following: <br />
<br />
There would be an NPC in POK who will talk to you only after you have 250 in all 7 skills. &quot;Hail and well met, _name_. I see that you have been very busy indeed in your spare time, a most hardworking _race_, indeed! We here in New Tanaan appreciate scholars and artists of all kinds, and somebody of your skill is highly valued indeed. I have been granted a token with which to reward those of your skills, would you be [interested]?&quot;<br />
<br />
You say, &quot;I am interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful, wonderful, I thought you might be! Well, I need you to do something for me first. It should be quite easy for somebody of your talent! Here is a display stand. I need you to attach each of your Grandmaster trophies to it in a sensible but pleasing manner, and then return it to me. Then I may grant you your reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
You receive &quot;A Display Stand&quot; (yellow idol graphic). Item LORE, NODROP. You take all your GM trophies, and like the Breakdown in Communication Quest, need to keep combining them together - in this case, the &quot;sensible but pleasing manner&quot; would be in alphabetical order - baking, brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, pottery, smithing, tailoring - in the correct tradeskill container. Each combine would yield a slightly different version of the Display Stand. So combine GM baker spoon + display stand in an oven, then that result + GM brewmaster in a brew barrel, etc. The combine can only be made with 250 of a given skill,  and is failable (however your previous display stand would be returned on failure). On the last combine (tailoring) it would yield &quot;A Filled Display Stand,&quot; which you would turn into the NPC. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic! Your skills are remarkable indeed. May we extend our congratulations on a job well done, and award you with this trophy to let everybody see your talents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reward would be of course LORE/NODROP - &quot;Talisman of the Grandmaster Tanaan Craftsman&quot; - and either: <br />
<br />
- a multi-slot piece of equipment that would fit in EAR, FINGER, NECK or HANDS and is directly on par with Aid Grimel reward/Talisman of Vah Kerrath, with 5% dodge and then something like FT3/regen 3 or maybe a stackable click effect that adds something. <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
- an augment that can be put in any # slot, on any piece of equipment, and add like +10 all stats/resists +100m/hp/end <br />
<br />
<br />
Reaching 1750 is a huge achievement, and for the time/commitment/plat put into it, it would not be unreasonable to get a reward that ANY 1750'er could obtain, not just the EP tradeskillers, and which we could proudly wear to show off. :)  The GM trophies are nice but quickly outgrown once you get in a high-end raid guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I was thinking about the /toolbelt idea some more last night and saw a problem in that for experimenting to get the new UI you would need the actual item. So I thought what would work for that would be a /detach command to remove the item from the toolbelt. Like say you have a dairy spoon, smithy hammer, and corking device and you want to experiment to get a new brewing recipe on your fast list, or are making one that isn't added to the learned list. So you do /toolbox to get a list of your tools, then /detatch corking device to remove the corking device from your belt (hench no summoning unlimited corking devices from it) to your cursor until you /toolbox it again.<br />
<br />
The reason I would prefer something like that is that it would mean 1 tool stays 1 tool through out the process, the only difference becomes whether it's in your inventory or flagged to you at the moment. That way there wouldn't be a need to put in any new tools for recipes as with a summoned version, or adjusting vendor buy prices on a tool to avoid mass summoning and selling tools. Of course it may not be even remotely possible to do, but I figure with a full board pitching ideas eventually we'll find something that may help the devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>AnnaaDruid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I really do not like seeing all this 'elementally flagged people are not real tradeskillers' sentiment. <br />
<br />
I never said that, or even implied it.  I said that I, personally, didn't have the time to do both.  What I would like to prevent is another situation, like the Grimel quest, where a really nice tradeskill item is unavailable to someone who, although a master of all trades, is unable to acquire it because of flag restrictions.  Imagine if the tradeskill trophies or the coldain shawl required EP drops...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I do like Meryddian's idea but for one major thing.<br />
<br />
Both the Aid Grimel earing and the VT Quest require high lvl mobs killed, either for the flags or the drop. I do not think the 7 trophy reward should be on par unless some other requirement is made. Yes you need to spend 18 AA's to reach 250 in all skills, but is this enough as anyone can do this given time exping. <br />
<br />
I would also argue that the &quot;Talisman of Vah Kerrath&quot; quest is killing the AHR (What ever that is). The hand in just delays getting the &quot;drop&quot;. You cannot eaily use this as an arguement to make the 7 trophy reward on par as you don't need to kill any type of raid mob. (I am assuming the AHR is a raid target, please correct me if I am wrong).<br />
<br />
Next, trophies are already expensive to make if you fail. Giving them another failable combine just adds to the expense. Then all you are doing is adding Plat to the &quot;difficulty&quot; of getting this item. I can easily make money, I can't easily get flagged/ kill raid targets. So again it doesn't truely add to the difficulty of getting this item. <br />
<br />
I do like the idea that it could be more of a useable item, I don't think we can expect anything like the AG earing or the AHR Neck item without similar risk and effort involved. <br />
<br />
The GM trophies are nice but quickly outgrown once you get in a high-end raid guild.<br />
<br />
Yes, that is because the effort of raiding is generally considered harder than tradeskilling. Killing high end raid mobs quires a guild, time and tactics. TS's require time and money. While I'd love something I can use into the end game I don't think we can expect it by maxing out 7 tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I would also argue that the &quot;Talisman of Vah Kerrath&quot; quest is killing the AHR (What ever that is).

<br />
AHR is Aten Ha Ra, the boss of Vex Thal, which is the final zone in Luclin.  Killing her is about the same as killing Quarm or The Avatar of War for their respective expansions. Except Vex Thal is a dreadfully boring raid zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The Talisman of Vah Kerrath shouldn't be compared to AG earring or anything in tradeskills.  It's much like the heads from the velious era (such as to get the white dragonscale helm).  The Talisman is bascially a drop from AHR, the only reason it's done the way it is is storyline driven (and to make people do some faction work after obtaining the essence).  The AG earring is as good as it is because it requires flags, you are in a sense getting rewarded not just for your tradeskilling, but also for getting flagging done.<br />
<br />
For me, the biggest reason to want a super trophy is to save room in my bank/bags.  To that end, I like the idea of combining the super trophy in it's respective container for a lore/no drop/no rent item with a 5% mod.  Make it the same stats as a normal trophy (so people don't have to lose stats to skill), same slot restrictions.  As for the super trophy itself, I liked the idea of having it summon no drop 10 slot giant 100% WR bags that are rentable, would be very nice and helpfull on farming trips to have something that did that.  Stat wise, I don't care if you give it the same stats as the current one, but, I think it should have a unique graphic so that it actually looks like a trophy, maybe a pretty particle effect too.<br />
<br />
Love the idea of the /toolbelt.  I'd have bank room again with that!!!!  However, is it possible that instead of /detach that a recipe would just check your toolbelt for the impliment even if it's done in experiment mode?  If that's not possible I'd say just don't make tools going to the toolbelt automatic, make a command for it, such as holding the item in your hand and doing /attach toolbelt or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">What if the bags from the super trophy also acted as coin purses, giving, say, 100% coin weight reduction?<br />
<br />
I think 100% coin WR might be too much, though, as the best purse I could find was 10-slot, 90% WR, 90% coin WR, wt. 0.1.<br />
<br />
Maybe 75% coin weight reduction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">This would be an awesome idea.  None of this super item stuff.  Standard trophy stats, a neat name for a job well done, and it can summon a new bag, originally NO RENT, you turn into the same gnome in the bazaar, and he gives you a 10 slot giant bag with COIN WR.  This way, even if you don't equip the bag because of the weak stats, you still have something you can say is valuable, as the only decent WR Bag outside of GoD is dropped off Yelniak, who is seldom raided.  Asking for something that summons several items in some form is too much, but a Coin bag would be very inline roleplay wise with a tradeskiller, would be valuable mostly to a tradeskiller, and because of the lack of statistical advantage, it would not put tradeskillers out of balance with other players.<br />
<br />
One more thing I thought of, this bag would not attract nearly as many people for 'tradeskilling for stats&quot; like what happened with AG.  This bag is really only useful considering the time/money/dedication to someone who liked tradeskilling. GREAT IDEA<br />
<br />
EDIT: As a side note, I do not think it would be terribly unbalanced to give 90% or even 100% WR to coin, no one will be soloing Quarm just because they can carry 1mpp into battle.</div></div><hr />

Why not make it possible to combine multiple trophies into 1, and there-by increasing the skill effect for those skills?  This would be an incentive for us to work towards more skills, and there is actually a reward.  Currently, there is not a real need to get a second trophy or 3rd, especially when you can get a geerlok for the same effect, the extra trophies are for bragging rights only.<br />
<br />
Let's say we have:<br />
<br />
1 trophy = 5% mod to skill<br />
2 trophies combined = 6% mod to those 2 skills<br />
3 trophies combined = 7% mod to those 3 skills<br />
4 trophies combined = 8% mod to those 4 skills<br />
5 trophies combined = 9% mod to those 5 skills<br />
6 trophies combined = 10% mod to those 6 skills<br />

and so on... for the tinkering, alchemy and poison making skills too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>aruvqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Now, the Aid Grimel quest yields the following:<br />
A couple things need to be pointed out.<br />
1) You need to be at least level 51 to do the Aid Grimel quest, because you need to spend AA's to get it and therefore you need to be of a level to earn AA's.<br />
2) You need to be Elemental flagged, or at least have real nice friends who are willing to help get you into the EPs to loot a Hope Stone. (not to mention all the flags you need before that)<br />
Which means, if you're 51+ and non-EP, you might be able to get yourself one of the lower-level earrings in the AG quest, but otherwise, at best, you only have the tradeskill trophies - which, if you're lucky, you can manage to combine at levels far below 250.<br />
So basically, right now, the BEST reward(s) in the game for the time/energy/cost involved in becoming a 1750 are limited to those who are EP flagged - and while granted that % of the population is growing, how many mains who are under 65 do you know who are?<br />
<br />
<br />
And where I cant speak for anybody mut myself, I will *NEVER* be elementally flagged, and there are a lot of things I will *NEVER* be able to make because the guilds have a lock on the planar ingredients needed.<br />
<br />
I will *never* join a raid guild, I value my lower level NONRAIDING friends more than I am willing to drop whatever commitments I PERSONALLY make to be with my friends to be at the beck and call of an uber guild. I will *never* go on raids with guild friends because to be blunt about it, I dont get any xp, i dont get any drops, there is absolutely NO benefit for me to go up and risk anything to be a CH ho. I will therefore *never* be flagged for anything. if I cant farm an ingredient with a single group, it ain't happening. I am all of 56th level, which means I *might* possibly be able to make a ceramic gavel of justice, ceramic hammer of innovation, ceramic skull of decay or a ceramic rod of storms, provided I can get the group together for it.<br />
<br />
As a wild example, I happen to have 2 each fire mephit blood and fiery granite. On Sol Ro, in bazaar I found 1 single solidified magma for 30K pp on a guild trade mule. I have 2 war wraith bloods, but the living coal was 22k pp. i have 4 large shards of stone, metallic liquids are selling for about 4.5 k if you get lucky... I am not uber enough to be able to throw around my plat...I got all my planar goodies by vendor diving late saturday nights after raids are done.  I am effectively cut out from making anything past faith/spirit stones that makes plat, simply because the game is rigged for people to need to join raiding guilds, or have serious plat that can afford to contact uber guilds and negotiate for tradeskill items. FWIW, I have a complete list of the ingredients for all the ceramic toys, and how many of what I have managed to scrounge up. I keep looking for any goodies i can find AND afford. I really wish they would take us nonraidguilded scum into account when they make recipes.</div></div><hr />

Not really wanting to  shot you down, but as it has been mentioned, the Mod factor is rather irevelent, and 240+ person is at cap (252) with a 5% mod,  upping the mod would just be a way to  help people with the plat to put out multiple trophy attemts at low level get capped faster, not help those already capped.<br />

Never say never.  On at least one server there's an open raiding group that recently killed RZ.  As far as being able to get ingrediants, I know several people on my server who have ingrediants for many ep or other high level pop combines without being elementally flagged, and me, with elemental flags, doesn't have as much.

They do.  Unfortunately, anything you can do, baby eating ubers can do better, faster and more often.  So if you can make anything worthwhile it will be soon made useless because the market will be thrashed by people who will make more of them quicker.  So you'll have a cool item of your own, maybe some plat if you are first to market and you'll bemoan how unfair it is the item you can make that seemed so snazzy doesn't sell and start something in PSR about evil undercutters.<br />

Very true. The guild I'm in barely has enough people on able to hunt in the planes, let alone go after the targets, but I've made lots of friends who are in the upper guilds and from them so far I have gotten most of the basic flags. &quot;All&quot; I need now to get to SolRoTower (my primary goal at the moment) is the actual god kills (Bert, TT, Saryn, Zeks, Marr) and Agnarr. A lot of big names yet I know, but understand that I'm only L63 right now and a non-epiced cleric (hoping to change that this weekend. :)<br />
<br />
As for the discussion at hand, I love many of the ideas mentionned. Still, since these are Tradeskill Trophies, it would be nice if they could modify your success rate over 252.<br />
<br />
I know the devers have said that it is nearly impossible due to 253-255 being 'special' skill levels, but you'd think it would be possible to tweek the actual Success function to take in the percentage and add some checks to round around the special levels or something. Wistfull dreaming I know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I am really concerned about this from a balancing point of view.  It is my feeling that the tradeskills rewards have diluted the overall value of tradeskilling.  We used to be able to make money on Solstice robes, cutting sickles etc, because the money it took to GM these skills made it not worth the while of the typical gamer to do it.  While I personally love the Aid Grimel quest, and I am close to finishing it, I wish it did not exist.  It encouraged a whole slew of new GM Smiths and Tailors to flood the market in these items, as it was a side effect of getting their new uber earring.  If this super trophy is too good, it will just be another incentive to further dilute the value and more importantly the uniqueness that comes with being a 1750 tradeskiller.  As such I have seen 2-3 decent ideas that gives some sort of value post-regular trophy, while preserving the identity/heritage of the tradeskilling community.  <br />
<br />
1) Summoning a Coin WR bag from a trophy with comparable stats to the regular trophy.  This is balanced because a coin bag is not terribly useful to your typical raider while raiding, but would be more valuable to your casual tradeskiller who is carrying around bags or ore etc (I am not foolish enough to say bags of money, as we are all broke after we finish =) )<br />
<br />
2) A trophy with a similar ability, but 1.5x the stats.  This would still be a sub-EP item, and would be valuable to a casual gamer.  The only concern with this is the casual gamers feel disenfranchised from EQ and that the game caters to the EP crowd, however, if this was in place, it would be the reverse. The EPers would not be able to use the meager device, as compared to a Secret of the Planes manual or something similar.<br />
<br />
3) And this is my new idea.  Perhaps the 7 trophies could combine together to make a CHARM.  There are so few charms in the game that are worth getting, that it would make sense to create one.  There is already 2 extremely powerful charms, the PoP one and the new GoD one.  If the Super trophy created a Charm that &quot;Gains in Power as you Master new Tradeskills,&quot; it would be something we are all proud to wear.  The end result of the CHARM would be comparable to the PoP Charm, making it not worth while for an already EP flagged player to get, but still would be useable by an EPer who wanted it as a symbol of their success.  For the casual players, this would be an abolsute boon because of the stellar stats on it.  The the risk/reward or a casual player would make it not worth the time for them to do unless the had an interest in the skills.  The sheer amount of money/time going into tradeskills would make getting a +100 mana/hp and +15 to all item for 500k+ would not be worth the effort when they could gear up bazaar upgrades totaling these numbers for loads less. ( and as a shaman, it might be nice to a little something added for those of us with an extra tradeskill, like an extra 10 hps, and +1 stat to symbolize the extra skill, but nothing significantly beter.)  It would not be terribly difficult to code in a +5% modifier to all tradeskills when the trophy was completely full, as focus effects have been added to other trophies already, and the +5% is essentially a focus effect.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I asked that it Gain in Power as you Grandmaster tradeskills, because we all know that you can make a trophy with lower skill, but this way you would still have to max yourself to 250 before you gained the stats.  For a point of reference, there is a CHARM slot item that references  your learned rare languages for the stats on it, making a perfect template for the developers to work from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, developers have previously stated that it is not possible to have more than one skill modifier on the same item. As an example, you can have an item with +5% to baking OR +5% to brewing, but not both.  And there is no modifier that is &quot;+5% to ALL skills&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Hmm...that seems rather contradictory to some of the time items. They have many items in Time that have +% mods to various skills. Granted, these are not tradeskills, but mods either way.  I don't see why this would not be possible. However, even without the mods, the charm idea would still be wonderful. <br />

<br />
As somebody pointed out... never say never; it's possible to get EP flagged these days and not be with any kind of uber guild. <br />
<br />
Also the only nodrop/looted items for this quest are the waters in Valor and the Hope Stone (EP drop). <br />
<br />
The &quot;lock&quot; on planar ingredients is unfortunate but rather true; for example, you have to get pretty far into Air to find spiders to drop the silks needed. At least most items are tradeable so you can find a way to negotiate your way for items if you're persistant enough. Flags are another matter.<br />
<br />
That's why what I suggested only checks your skill level for the combine, not flags, not character level. Ok fine, have the combines be no-fail too, but the whole point of it was that you cannot make it without being 250 in every skill. It wouldn't care if you weren't &quot;uber&quot;; you made the time and the effort to get the reward. So people who just tradeskilled to 220 to pass AG still have a lot of work to do.<br />
<br />
Lot of anger towards ubers and their twinks... people who go through the effort to make two 1750 characters are doubly insane than the rest of us! You still have to take a massive amount of time/effort to level tradeskills - the only &quot;advantage&quot; an &quot;uber&quot; vs &quot;non-uber&quot; would have in that department is possibly better cash flow for items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, whoever told you tradeskilling and &quot;advancing through the planes&quot; is an either-or deal is, quite frankly.. a moron.  I have a Plane of Time flag, 5 tradeskills at 250 and the last 2 in the 220s.  I also know a ton of other people that could say the same (or better).<br />
<br />
I am really concerned about this from a balancing point of view. It is my feeling that the tradeskills rewards have diluted the overall value of tradeskilling.

<br />
Ah yes, I see your point.  Since the AG quest drove people to tradeskill it has unbalanced the game.  Because.. you know, if AG never existed and all those people had just simply chosen to do tradeskills and flooded the markets the same way, that wouldn't be unbalancing at all.   :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I think you are just annoyed that your grip on the tradeskill market has been weakened.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, I think the toolbelt thing is a great idea.  There should however, be an actual waist item called &quot;Toolbelt&quot;.  Tools would only go on the belt when it was equipped and tools could only be used from it when it was equipped.  I doubt the developers like the idea of freeing up ALL the tool space, this would at least require 1 space be left (to store the belt) and require the player to make use of 1 item (that being the belt) like they would when using X tool in Y combine anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More significant changes?<br />
<br />
I've played the game for nearly four years now and the &quot;Suchandsuch would require recoding etc, etc, etc&quot; thing has popped up countless times.  So many times in fact that if there has ever been a possible &quot;significant change&quot;, THAT is it.  Not to mention, every time they make these coding changes they trumpet it like the coming of Ceasar, delcaring that it will pave the way for bigger and better improvements.<br />
<br />
Anyway, much to my chagrin I saw the very replies I dread seeing the most in the fan faire write-up.

EQ is an old and very complicated game, and these are things the original coders couldn't possibly have imagined.  Would all that effort really be worth it given all the much simpler bug fixes, improvements, additions, etc that could be accomplished instead in that same amount of time?  In the grand scheme of things, not a whole lot of people would be getting one of these super trophies.  That is part of the appeal of the thing, but I'd have to think it also greatly reduces its priority when the devs are deciding what should be done next.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we shouldn't keep asking.  Eventually there may be enough reasons to do a massive overhaul, so it's good to keep this request fresh so that it could be accomodated at that time.  Or a way to work around the complication might be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">One thing about the approach of &quot;This would take too much time and benefit too few people&quot; - that's not quite how it works out in reality. Used to be tradeskills were all but worthless from a utility point of view and much much fewer people did them. I should know, I used to get regularly laughed at for my baking and tailoring obsession. Time was put into improving the trades and the people followed, now the people who laughed at my swooning over brownie parts are out hunting for their own brownie parts. At the time I had maxed my tailoring due to shortage of recipies out there it would have made little sense to improve tailoring from a statistical point of view since so few people were interested in it. Most of the people on the server would have said it was far far more important to make a new plane zone to alleviate crowding in PoH than to improve such a small and useless aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
Usually it will follow that the more effort and time is put towards improving something, the more attractive it will seem to people. So even if you have relatively few people who would benefit from some of the suggestions put forth right now, but this is not to say the bandwagon would not get jumped upon some time after the changes. The earring would be the clearest example of this.<br />

I would suggest you actually try to get up to the point where you can get in to a top 5 raiding guild on your server, then gear up to average level and then do what is needed to do to maintain yourself there before you make statements like that, in tradeskills you to not loose out, ever, you do not fall behind, you may miss out on the &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; for &quot;Big Proffits&quot;  but you will not go from the top person on your server to some follow on in the mid 20's only able to make a combine on someone handing you components out of sympathy.<br />
<br />
You may take 100's of hours of work to farm the plat to get the componets to make the combine to try for Ultra_spiffy_item_002 which I can farm up in 4-8 hours, and make some plat doing it.  You may think that it is unfair, you do not take into account the 35-42 hours a week it takes to get there and stay there so I can farm for those items.<br />
<br />
No amount of work I can do on Dai, no XP no spell will give me track or let me make a mana vial.  Yes, I have some weak forage abilities (Iksar), but I am out classed buy a level 40 ranger on that account.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Ruldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Hmm...that seems rather contradictory to some of the time items. They have many items in Time that have +% mods to various skills. Granted, these are not tradeskills, but mods either way.  I don't see why this would not be possible. However, even without the mods, the charm idea would still be wonderful. <br />
<br />
It may be that they are not willing to do this, which is fine, I can carry a geerlok bag like I always have.<br />
This seems contradictory because of the different fields that they added to the item data structure over time.  With luclin they added the &quot;skillmodtype&quot; and &quot;skillmodvalue&quot; fields, which specify which skill is being effected and what percentage it gets.  An item can only have a single value in each of these fields, and this is why it can only have one percentage modified skill (For example, if we look at the raw data from lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemraw.html?id=16863) for the Collapsible Fishing Pole, we see a &quot;skillmodtype&quot; of 55 and a &quot;skillmodvalue&quot; of 5).<br />
<br />
But with PoP and specifically items from Time, they added a few more fields.  For example, if we look at Ton Po's Chestwraps of Composure (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47650), we see &quot;Skill Add DMG: Flying Kick +15%&quot;, &quot;Skill Mod: Block +8%&quot;, &quot;Avoidance: +15&quot;.  The first of these uses the &quot;dmgplusamnt&quot; and &quot;dmgplustype&quot; fields (and this apparently works as an increase to the damage, and not as an increase to the actual Flying Kick skill I believe), the middle uses the luclin skill add fields, and the latter uses the &quot;avoidance&quot;.  The other Time stats work in a similar way.</div></div><hr />

1: You get rid of those multiple tradeskill mod items in your vault and replace them with a single item. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I am very much against the idea of a super trophy requiring any items from the high end game.  I am almost a 1750 tradeskillker (just need a few more points in smithing) and I did it because I love tradeskills, not because of things like the Grimel earring.  Which, by the way, is an item I can't get, because I don't have the flags, because I prefer to spend my time tradeskilling rather than advancing through the planes.  The super trophy should not be linked to how good your guild is.<br />
<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
The flipside of the exact same coin is that a super trophy should not be linked to how 'bad' your guild is either. 'bad' is completly the wrong word I know, because it wasn't meant to be as an insult to your guild or playstyle. The point I'm trying to get across is that the items you listed have absolutely no value to people well above your level of content.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't make items requiring high level drops because you can't reach them.<br />
They wouldn't make items they'd never use just to take up a vault space.<br />
<br />
End result in both cases: a proportion of the tradeskillers are excluded from the result.<br />
<br />
For that reason, stats should be pretty much irrelevent on the super trophy, and it should be a globally useful 'utility' item, tailored towards a tradeskill of any level's needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">So basicaly you are removing all the stats and adding coin weight reduction?<br />
(even if you could get all %mods on one item)<br />
<br />
Sorry but thats usless.  People still need the stats when equiping for a mod.<br />
<br />
As for all this talk of coin weight reduction.  I cant see the benefit (well, not for everyone).  It is next to usless on my PVP server, nobody takes coin with them.  You would just loose it if you got PKed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Sorry but thats usless.  People still need the stats when equiping for a mod.<br />
<br />
What do they need the stats for? They're 1750 (by definition) so don't need it for skilling up. The only one they'll possibly miss (in a tradeskilling environment) is the charisma for buying/selling, and since that caps out at 105 I believe, they few people who benefit from it would get max benefit from two regular trophies if they needed it that desperately<br />
<br />
When you add stats you specifically target only a small subsection of the tradeskillers. It has to be restricted by access drops to prevent the item being overpowered on lower levels/content (eg Aid Grimel) or have stats useless to people beyond them (eg: geerlocks, existing trophies)<br />
<br />
The aim was to make a TRADESKILL super trophy that provided a use for tradeskillers of any exp level and any content level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Personally, I stand by my original assertion.  Double or triple the stats on a current trophy, add HP, mana, and saves, give it NO tradeskill mods, and make it summon unlimited (non-lore) 100%WR bags that also give some amount of coin reduction.  Place this trophy in a tradeskill container alone and combine to get back the trophy and a no-rent item with just a skill mod on it.<br />
<br />
The super trophy should have stats; it's an upgrade to seven items with stats, so removing those stats amounts to a nerf.  The stats should be valuable and beneficial by the current standards of the game.  If you don't believe this last assertion, compare the Berserker epic weapon with almost any other epic in the game.  The reason for the Berserker epic's superiority, as stated by the devs at the Fan Faire, is that they wanted to make an item that was competitive with current content.  Apply that logic to tradeskills, and this new trophy should be somewhere between the existing trophies and the Aid Grimel earring in terms of stats and abilities.  (The AG earring also requires an additional cost in the form of flags, so it should probably still be superior.)<br />
<br />
The issue of multiple mods on one item would require a fundamental change to how the game stores and manages items.  They've done such changes before, so it's not inconceivable that they would make such changes again.  However, the devs have made it clear that tradeskills (and specifically, this trophy) are not a priority reason to make such a change.  Perhaps in a new expansion they'll upgrade the game's code to handle unlimited mods, or some arbitrarily large number (say, ten).  We can't count on that.  My stance is that our time and effort invested in tradeskills should lead to a tangible, meaningful reward that is easy to implement and won't cause the developers to say, &quot;This isn't worth our time to develop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pootle, to address your specific point.  I though on PVP servers where items can be looted off other players, no-drop items and items in bags were exempt?  Thus, others wouldn't be able to take the trophy or the bags anyway.  As to looting coins, well, that's an element of the environment.  Granted, it means the bags would be less useful for you ... but how could getting unlimited 100%WR bags, as opposed to just one, be seen as a bad thing, even on a PVP server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Demorgoth, <br />

Of course stats are still useful to a 1750 tradeskiller.  It’s the % mod to tradeskills that is of no further use (once you are 250 skill, you don’t really need a skill mod item, do you?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">The stats should be valuable and beneficial by the current standards of the game.<br />
<br />
That's the problem I was trying to avoid. 'Valuable and benficial' depends entirely on perspective, and a fixed value only really applies to a very very small proportion of the gamewide tradeskillers at once.<br />
<br />
For range slot I've already got a 290hp item, and obviously I need my pri/sec for agro weapons (being a warrior). What stats would you suggest it have so that it's 'valuable and beneficial' to someone like me? <br />
<br />
What's the difference in exluding those tradeskillers in the high end game by making stats they wouldn't use, and excluding tradeskillers at other parts of the game by making drops they couldn't reach?<br />
<br />
I like the 'combine for a nodrop/norent tradeskill mod item' idea though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought relative skill level was the only thing that determined successful combines, and stats only affected skillups? If you're not skilling up, what use *while tradeskilling* would stats give, other than charisma for buying/selling if not above 105?<br />
<br />
I'm deliberately differentiating between a 1750 tradeskiller, and a person with 1750 in tradeskills who needs stats for adventuring, because of the reasons outlined above about choosing a value that's the same for everyone<br />
<br />
The % mod would take you from 250 (player cap) to 252 (real cap), and I only chose 5% because 1% looks so silly hehe. Could make it 1% and have no difference. A single effect: Aura of the Tradeskill Masters, giving 1% to all tradeskills would look even better, but I doubt they'd be willing to code that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Ah yes, I see your point. Since the AG quest drove people to tradeskill it has unbalanced the game. Because.. you know, if AG never existed and all those people had just simply chosen to do tradeskills and flooded the markets the same way, that wouldn't be unbalancing at all. <br />
<br />
I think you are just annoyed that your grip on the tradeskill market has been weakened.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, Lex, you are wrong. I have been tradeskilling long before PoP and there were VERY few tradeskillers who tradeskilled &quot;just because.&quot;  It was not until the advent of AG that people tradeskilled for the gear associated with it.  If these people had actually decided to tradeskill because they &quot;had just simply chosen to do tradeskills&quot; I would have no problem with it.  Your Time flag and EP gear is impressive and all, but I TOO have advanced flags and the ability to do AG myself, but I am STILL irritated by the fact that the market has been flooded, and more importantly, the lower level tradeskillers have been pushed out because of the demand for higher priced farmed goods from the bazaar.  There was always a market for scalped priced Leather Padding, but this price has skyrocketed directly in corrolation with the number of people that end up able to do AG.  It is not my wanting to have a &quot;grip on the tradeskill market&quot; but that I, in fact, would like to see a TRADESKILL market.  It does not exist, maybe 1% of all tradeskilled items are marketable, and this is without a doubt because of tradeskill inflation due to increased in game rewards vs. the plat required/plat received that was originally inherent with tradeskilling. I doubt that you yourself are one of these bandwagon tradeskillers, but we have all met them.  We have all gotten tells &quot;What is the quickest way to my AG earring.&quot;  Anyone who has tradeskilled before PoP has seen the difference.<br />
<br />
I made my post wanting to make this new trophy compatible with everyone in the game, not just myself.  Personally, I would love to see an item that I could equip 100% of the time without sacrificing anything of mine, but I realize that tradeskilling is not a gift given to me and other EP players, so I didn't request it.  Tradeskills should remain independent of your players level like they were intended, and be based on your tradeSKILL as it implies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Taadieri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I like the idea of a trophy that you can only get if you have 250 in all 7 of the main tradeskills that would be useful, but not unbalancing, to anyone that could earn it.  It isn't easy to make an item worth equipping for a level 65 Time-flagged character that is balanced for a level 51 tradeskill fanatic that just ground out enough aa to get the tanaan craft masteries.<br />
<br />
The idea of making the trophy an augment seems like a good one.  As suggested before, have the player hail an NPC that will check for 250 in all tradeskills before handing out a box to combine all 7 trophies.  Turning in the box would result in a character flag and and a lore no-drop augment that fits into any augment slot and any equipment type.  The character flag is needed so that if the player wants to put the augment on a different piece of equipment, they can remove it with a solvent and get a replacement from the NPC as with the reward from the Breakdown in Communications quest.<br />
<br />
As for what to put on the augment, I think +50 hp/mana/end and +10 to all stats and resists would be reasonable.  <br />
<br />
As suggested before, give it an effect that summons a different bag than the one summoned by the regular trophies.  I personallly think the bags should be no rent as the current ones are now, but turning one in to a quest NPC would return a permanent bag that is 80% wr and affects coin weight.   <br />
<br />
Having the no rent bags contain 7 no rent tradeskill mods would reduce the need to carry those mods around all the time, but would also require a player to destroy each of them if they were summoning up the bag to hold stuff, so it is not clear whether this would be a desirable feature or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">The toolbelt is a wonderful idea.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing a version for each skill though in the process.<br />
<br />
My case as an example:<br />
<br />
I have a sk that smiths, brews and fletches over 200.  She also does some other tradeskills at a bit lower level to make stuff for her main skills.  <br />
<br />
I have a druid who bakes and tailors over 200.<br />
<br />
I have 3 mules who carry the extra stuff for these tradeskilling characters.<br />
<br />
My banks are always full , my inventory is always full.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is stopping me from being 1750 is the room! I dont just want to get to 1750, I want to make things once I get up there.  With two characters doing tradeskills I can barely make things I would like to make.  I tend to throw away or sell things I would rather just combine, due to lack of space.<br />
<br />
An ultimate toolbelt would be a great prize for a 1750, but a GM toolbelt along the way for each skill, adding your current GM skills to it as you go along would help save more space and encourange to use these skill more for just &quot;leveling&quot; them.<br />
<br />
I think it is the most boring thing to just grab some items and grind levels!!  With the current quests, that's what I see a lot of people doing.  What is the point of that?<br />
<br />
toolbelt each skill<br />
final toolbelt for all skills $$$</div></div><hr />

I know people are concerned with the room all the trophies take up in their bank, and unfortunatly my idea dosent help with that.  I am just looking at the 'reward' for reaching 1750.<br />
<br />
Go to an NPC in POK and interact with them.  Tell him/her you are a [grandmaster of all tradeskills].<br />
<br />
The game then checks this and the NPC then replys 'here is a symbol of your skill, so others will see you are a true GrandMaster.'<br />
<br />
Reward.<br />
<br />
Symbol of the GrandMaster Tradeskiller.<br />
An Augment.  with some pretty good, but not insane stats.<br />
This way you can link the item you aug to proove to people you are what you say you are.<br />
Also you get it on a hail in case you need to remove the aug, to either upgrade that equipment slot, or you need to move aug to another place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Anubsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">the need to recode the &quot;cap&quot; the trophies right now are somewhat redundant as they do not do anything for a gm skiller the cha and int would be nice if these werent my primaries and when i first got it was useful but then i was able to max my primaries with the jewlery i was making, an epic gm trophy should make all trivial combines trivial not kinda trivial unless the components are expensive in which case youre sweating every click. <br />
sorry im kinda disgruntled over their reply especially with some of the GoD combines still not working correctly or at all. It seems that the devs are all for doing anything that doesnt require them to actually do anything. thats my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>byelka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I was thinking how they could handle this grandmaster<br />
trophy idea using the current game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Here is my idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Put a guy in PoK who will give you some symbol<br />
of Grandmaster Artisan if you have all 7 main<br />
tradeskills at 250.<br />
<br />
Take this symbol and combine it with the<br />
7 grandmaster trophies in a forge.<br />
<br />
The result is 2 items.<br />
<br />
<br />
1st item) <br />
<br />
Basically a clicky geerlok but it has 15% mod<br />
(I know 252 is the max but at least 15% looks neat)<br />
<br />
1st item Grandmaster geerlok hammer +15% to smithing<br />
Click on it and it changes to<br />
2nd item Grandmaster geerlok gem setter +15% to jewelcraft<br />
Click on it and it changes to<br />
<br />
Well you get the point and then of course it cycles through <br />
again.<br />
<br />
2nd item)<br />
<br />
Grandmaster Workbench<br />
<br />
Click on it and it summons a 100% 10 stot no rent<br />
no drop bag.  (similar to what we have now)<br />
<br />
But it does one more thing... <br />
The bag has a combine button.<br />
Take the grandmaster geerlok gem setter place it in there <br />
and hit combine and you get the geerlok back and a no rent<br />
no drop item that is like the collapsable items but it<br />
can summon a planar jewellers kit.  This of course<br />
would create items based on what grandmaster geerlok you<br />
put in it.  So for some skills like baking that have<br />
several things used for combines it could return multiple<br />
'collapsable' type items.  <br />
<br />
<br />
You get the idea.<br />
<br />
They may argue that it not summon up a forge or brew barrel.<br />
I would of course love for it to do this but so be it if<br />
they decide not to this.<br />
<br />
Also to add to this the combine in the workbench could also<br />
create commonly used tools at the same time it returns the<br />
collapsable items.  ie smithing would return hammer and file,<br />
Baking would return non-stick frying pan and dairy spoon.  You<br />
get the idea. Then make all the items it summons sell back <br />
for 1 cP so there is no abuse of the system.<br />
<br />
So what do you think?<br />

<br />
<br />
I whole-heartedly agree.  I will never see the places to be able to make the items that show my skill. This is tradeskilling we are talking about, not raiding. Why should we be penalized for doing what it is we do? Why can we NOT have an item that says our work is valued and apprieciated?  I think this idea hits it right on the mark.  Gives us a value in game. Something we can work for that is attainable to the non elemental flagged tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
I love the idea of the toolbelt, adding the tools as we use them, making it so we can take the tool off would be awesome. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Yitara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I like the idea of a super trophy benefiting all tradeskillers.  I don't like the idea of making it have stats so nice it will drive EVERY temperary EP Aid Grimel only tradeskilling uber guildie type (you know what I mean here) decide that they need to push their skills from 220 up to 250 now to get this really great item.  That will simply continue to destroy the whole concept of tradeskilling for tradeskilling's sake.  <br />
<br />
So, what is something that ALL tradeskillers would like to see?  Its not more bags, more charisma, FT, etc., etc. etc.  These vary too much from player to player.  To me there are really only three things that all real tradeskillers would like to see an improvement in:  An increased chance for success on non trivial items,  a decreased chance of failure on trivial items and the ability to reduce the number of bank slots alloted to &quot;tools&quot;.<br />
<br />
The chance of success is of course related to the skill level.  Alas, the devs seem to think that 252 is the max skill level obtainable and its not worth the programming effort to allow this cap to be broken.  Too bad, because this would allow them to put in nicer and nicer items that have higher and higher skill requirements and create a goal for people to continue to improve their trade skill ability.  If I were a dev I would be thinking of ways to get people to put more time into the game.  But, I can see where this is not a trivial programming issue and benefits so few people so move on, probably ain't gunna happen.<br />
<br />
Decreasing the failure rate on trivial items would also be a boon to true tradeskillers and one that corrects what I think is a horrible injustice.  If I have perfected my skill to the point where I can achieve a super trade skill trophy, why do I still fail 5% of the time on the most trivial of items.  Do I fall off my bike 5% of the time?  No, of course not, riding a bike is TRIVIAL to me now.  I actually think this should be corrected somehow for tradeskillers of all abilities, but in particular those that have reached 250 in skill.  And why is this such a difficult thing to program?  Wouldn't it just be one more variable to program into the formula for success or failure?  I don't buy the argument that this can't be improved on and I think from a reward versus effort from devs, something that I think should really be pushed by us the players.  Personally, I think if someone is 100 points over the trivial point of an item it should be a no fail combine.  I guess I would like a better explanation of why something like this couldn't be implemented on a super trophy, &quot;reduces the chance of failure on trivial combines by x%&quot; or some such.<br />
<br />
Finally, clear up that much needed bank space.  The least a super trophey should do is allow one to trade in seven tropies giving the 5% mod for each trade skill.  I suppose giving 1.5 to 2 times the stats is nice, but, like I said above, don't go overboard and make people drool over it.<br />
<br />
I like the tool belt idea as well, but that sounds like a major programming effort and really something that only makes sense if they are going to be available for all tradeskillers, like the key ring is available to everyone right now.  I think that idea is golden and should be worked on regardless of the Supertrophy idea.  I mean, the name of the game is to make people want to play EQ, and making trade skilling more enjoyable does that.  Remember people, its not just what we want that the devs are willing to work on, its things we want that will make us play EQ more and longer.<br />
<br />
Finally, why does it need to be tied to getting 250 in each skill?  One can make an individual trophy now at less than 250 and with the 5% mod that actually makes sense to try it at 240.  It seems much easier for the devs to code if all they have to do is create a quest bag where you turn in your seven trophies in exchange for the Super Trophy.  Yes, I know this diminishes the recognition of those that have gone on to hit the 1750 club, but as mentioned above, special recognition for that achievement is intentionally not being recognized.  I think the people who have trudged on to 250 in each skill know how special they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Kieroth_whiteleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Quick commentary on failures:<br />
<br />
The current failure system is not capped at 5% - if your skill is significantly higher than the trivial (I don't know the exact number, I *THINK* I heard 100, but that may or may not have been from a dev type) your failure odds drop.<br />
<br />
This has been verified by people - 200+ skill people attempting metal bits, heady kiolas, etc have been responding that the success rate seems to go up.<br />
<br />
I do heady kiolas in batches of 80 (giving one stack's worth of wu's attempts) and typically fail on only one, SOMETIMES two. This has been relatively consistent, so I don't think it's just the RNG being nice to me. Other people have reported similar things. My brewing skill is right now is ~140. It's not the 0 failures that the equation would create, but it's definitely better than the 5% that it used to be.<br />
<br />
Regarding the upper end trophy - *MY* personal opinion on this is that I'm not getting worked up one way or the other. I'd *REALLY* like a mechanism to dump my 5 or so smithing hammers, collection of needles, baking implements and geerloks. But I also think that the ability to dump those things to a &quot;keyring&quot; should be available to EVERYONE, not *JUST* 1750 people.<br />
<br />
*MY* reward for being &quot;uber&quot; in tradeskills (not that I'm there, but I'm getting closer) is:<br />
* The ability to make **** near anything I want with reasonable odds of success<br />
* The availability of quests (coldain, AG, solstice) that aren't otherwise available to me<br />
* The ability to make a profit off items I make without having to be in a raiding guild<br />
<br />
I'm a tradeskiller. You ask anyone in my guild what the most important thing for me in everquest is, and the first answer you'll hear is &quot;my guild&quot;, the second one is &quot;smithing&quot;. Usually the two go together - as I'm usually the one equipping the characters that I think are underequipped for their level. It's not uncommon for me to dump a class appropriate suit of LDoN plate or chain on someone just to get them up to &quot;decent&quot;. Dark Elf cultural for the people that can use it.<br />
<br />
I also happen to be ~240 in all weapon skills. As in *all* of them. I don't get a trophy for that. I have all of my combat skills maxxed except throwing and bash. I have swim, at, and bind wounds maxxed. I have 100 in all languages - not that that's an accomplishment, with the right group it takes 10-15 minutes.<br />
<br />
The thing is, for NONE of those skills do you get any kind of recognition, ability or cool identifier for just having raised it. In casting, my cleric doesn't get anything special for her abjuration at 220 except for the ability to cast temp without draining her mana bar on fizzles.<br />
<br />
I find it really interesting how many people post on here like they've sacrificed the whole rest of the game for the sake of tradeskills because they *LOVE* tradeskills, but then turn around and demand some supercool item/quest/etc to reward their skill. As far as I know, Aid Grimel is the ONLY quest that requires a certain level of skill to do - Tradeskilling or otherwise. There's no quests that can only be done with a skill of 200 in swimming. Or 1H slash.<br />
<br />
There's complaints that a character can't make planar quality items because they can't get into the planes at their level, so they can't advance beyond &quot;X&quot; skill at their level.<br />
<br />
But really, they're lucky - At level 1, a person *CAN* (not likely, but possible) jump into the 1750 club. And they're still stuck at 10 in 1hs.<br />
<br />
I've put a lot of time into my 1hand Blunt skill. I've had to level all the way up to level 57 just to hit 240. And I can't think about 245 until level 58.<br />
<br />
*I* think the &quot;coolness&quot;/&quot;uberness&quot; of the trophy should depend on the following factor, and ONLY the following factor:<br />
* The cost/difficulty involved in the components<br />
<br />
That factor is keeping in mind that depending on skill level, a hypothetical trophy should be based around the AVERAGE number of components to finish it, NOT just the number of a &quot;first try success&quot;.<br />
<br />
If it requires a drop off quarm, I'm okay with that. But the **** thing better be VERY cool.<br />
<br />
If it requires a snake egg and nothing else, I don't care how bad it sucks, regardless of trivial level, because the stupid things are so easy to get - they just require some time. Obviously, an intelligent dev would put it somewhere between.<br />
<br />
I'm all for recognition. But I feel like this community makes a distinction between tradeskillers and raiders like there's some mystic line that separates the two. If a person has a 250 in their weapon skill, I can safely assume that they've at least put some time in on the autoattack. A person in 1750 club DOESN'T necessarily mean they're a &quot;tradeskiller&quot; as defined by what appears to be the majority of this board - the only assumptions one can make are that they somehow acquired a large number of components, they did some minimal amount of research on how to skill up, and that they spent a snotload of time clicking combine.<br />
<br />
I have probably spent more time developing my weapon skills than most of the GM tradeskillers have spent on their craft - yes, it's just mashing autoattack, but tradeskills are just clicking combine. Wait you say - tradeskilling also requires farming, research and time... but wait.. so does leveling to 57 and staying alive in zones where mobs aggro if you get within 3 miles of them while dodging characters who were obviously an impulse buy on Ebay. I'm not trying to belittle anyone, but it frustrates me that many (*NOT* ALL) of the &quot;tradeskillers&quot; think of this as some private club that requires a secret handshake and raiders can't join. <br />
<br />
People like Niami, Verdandi, Kizrak (sp?) and Zeralynn I definitely consider tradeskillers - not only have they put in the time to level their skills, but they have also done a surprising amount of research and *KNOW* their skills better than most raiders know Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
That isn't anything to do with their tradeskill levels. Zeralynn's magelo last time I looked at it was sub-250 in a few things, and despite the fact that she's like the world's expert on smithing she's not even 250 in it yet. And I mean it, she *IS* the world's expert. I truly believe she knows more on the subject than most of the devs who work on smithing. Her reward for that is more than just some trophy - it's the fact that she knows everything about her craft and she can do anything with it now - she knows which combines are profitable, where/when/how to sell them, market values, trivial levels, success odds, and a host of other things - the same way us dumb raiders know mob hitpoints, aggro ranges, weaknesses and the best time to pop a cheal. Which in MY opinion is worth more than any conceivable stats/abilities of some stupid trophy you could program a bot to make.<br />
<br />
So like people have said earlier (but don't always seem to actually *mean*) - the reward is in the activity itself.<br />
<br />
Many people have said that the tradeskill trophy shouldn't be available to &quot;just anyone&quot;. Those same people argue against aid grimel, because it's not fair to tradeskillers to make them jump through the hoop that is flagging.<br />
<br />
Obviously, the earring is something worth jumping through hoops for - Some of those raiders feel the same way about tradeskills that tradeskillers feel about xp grinds and raiding guilds - but *THEY* put in the effort in an area they didn't like to get a reward they wanted. We have the same options.<br />
<br />
I'm not in a raiding guild, despite the fact I enjoy raiding. I've been invited into no less than 10. If I *WANTED*, I could be 65 with a hundred aa's and ornate level gear in a few weeks. But I totter along in tradeskills, look longingly at the AG earring and think &quot;someday I'll make it there&quot;, because I'm enjoying the tradeskilling and occasional raiding with a guild I love more than committing my character to 5-7 nights a week of raiding. That's my choice. I'm not going to knock anyone else for making theirs. Those same raiding guilds could get me up to 1750 practically overnight, but I'd rather make the journey with the friends I've made in my guild instead.<br />
<br />
If it's fun for you, do it. If it's not, don't. If the reward seems appropriate for the work, do it. If it doesn't, don't.<br />
<br />
If you don't think the 1750 club is appropriately recognized, DON'T WORK FOR IT. I'm going to. Not because I want to be part of the &quot;elite club&quot; - because I think we're putting way too much emphasis on a number - but because I want the *benefits* of having my skill up that high.<br />
<br />
We don't *NEED* an uber-trophy. I'm not going to turn one down, because I do think it'd be cool. I just don't understand the focus on it. I would *MUCH* prefer viable recipes for gear that is competitive with drops that require the same amount of work to get - it's embarassing that my greaves of the myrmidon only took 4 drops and have 40 ac when my dark elf cultural that requires blue diamonds, snotloads of farming and 200+ skill to be viable and still has less benefits. I don't want to run around with a trophy and a big sign saying &quot;I'm a tradeskiller and I'm cool because I have carpal tunnel&quot;. I want something WORTH MAKING. Worth making for *ME* means &quot;raid capable&quot;. Both so I have potential buyers, and because I LIKE raiding.<br />
<br />
*MY* vote for the devs:<br />
<br />
*Screw the supertrophy.<br />
*Close the gaps in cultural and give us something competitive to make at higher levels.<br />
*Give us some weapons and armor, with a respectable drop rate for it's difficulty/uberness. Make it competitive with whatever similarly leveled raiders can get for similar difficulty. Include appropriate stat bonuses. Int items at higher levels should still have str/sta/dex type bonuses, if not as many. STR items should have a token nod to int/wis/cha.<br />
*Class specific stuff. LDoN plate is pretty nifty for a SK/Cleric because the int/wis bonuses are nice, and the ac isn't that much lower than what is normally class available. But for a warrior, it sucks compared to comparable drop/quested gear.<br />
*Smooth out the &quot;hell levels&quot; in skillups (190 - 210{?}) - One shouldn't have runs of 100 failures even if the RNG is being whacked out. Cap failure chains at like 50 or something. That's not pandering to the lowest denominator, it's common sense. If you want to know how to code it, give me a call. Four lines of code.<br />
*Proc/focus effects. Augs are a nice start. I'm even okay with just limiting it to augs, although it'd be nice if it were innate to the item. Let's face it: what caster wants tailored armor when you can't put any kind of focus effect on it?<br />
*Stop with the bloody items that require forages or only drop 1 in a million in a skillup path. My 57 warrior relies on my 23 ranger for drops in LDoN to get to 212, because I don't have the financial backing for anything better. If it's a skill all classes can use, they need to be provided a mechanism to increase it.<br />
*Make more of the drops have a favorable (balanced of course.. I'm not asking for handouts) drop rate on mobs which are an appropriate level for the relative skill level. It seems funny that if you match skill levels, a person OUGHT to hit the 200s around 40th level, at which point things like shadowscream start turning green. Make mobs useful in the creation of 200+ items *DARK BLUE*. At least give us SOME XP in our mindless farming.<br />
*In skills that require low level drops in order to advance (leather padding, silk thread, etc) give us a higher level option. Sure, it'll take longer to rack them up since we can't just aoe the crap outta whole camps, but at least we get some xp (and slows up our farming rate). At this point I'm okay with a little bit of nonsense (LDoN mobs dropping spiderling silk) just to make it viable. Maybe then our friends won't mind hunting with us so much (My guild is *wonderful*, but there's only so long our 65 mage is willing to help me farm hoppers).<br />
<br />
THOSE would be worth hundreds of times more value to me than any stats you could stick on the ubertrophy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">I thought of the same kind of thing -- something that requires all seven tradeskill trophies for the combine.  I don't think there would be a problem &quot;creating demand&quot; for this trophy, I think those that master all seven would want to do this out of pride.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see it as a skill-restricted combine of all seven GM trophies, where you have to be skill 1750 to do the combine.<br />
<br />
I&quot;d like to see it end up as something that would have superior stats such that it would be worth equipping in the range slot instead of, say... Secrets of the Planes.  In other words... 250 hp/mana, 20 all resists, 40 ac, some nice effects.<br />
<br />
Yes it would be delightful to have it be +10% to all skills and have them exceed the cap, but this isn't likely. :(<br />
<br />
Another idea that occurred to me would be to combine all seven tradeskill trophies with some OTHER quest items -- combine them with the aid grimel earring and/or the coldain prayer shawl to make an item wearable in primary, secondary, range, ammo, shoulders, and/or ear slots.  Heck let them combine the seven with &quot;mana crystals&quot; from the phylactery quest, at least those would have a use then.<br />
<br />
Let those that reach 1750 have an additional trophy from combining all seven tradeskill trophies with aid grimel earring.  Having to do aid grimel will prevent people from doing the combine on lowbies or twinks.  And requiring skill 1750 to do the no-fail combine will mean that they have to have spent the aa's, also a min level check.<br />
<br />
Another possibility woudl be to allow combining with an eighth trophy -- poison or alchemy or tinkering or whatever -- to make a version specifically tailored for that class/race's stuff.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, it would be great to see an item that has the end results of a range slot (or ear or wherever) that is equivalent to loot dropping in Uqua.  Here's what I see:<br />
<br />
Legendary Grandmaster Trophy<br />
Ear / Range<br />
35 AC<br />
25 all stats<br />
25 all resists<br />
225 hp/mana<br />
+10% all tradeskills<br />
mana regen +5<br />
focus effect: Zeburoxor's Preservation (25% mana cost reduction all spells)<br />
effect: summon Nutsack<br />
regen +10<br />
attack +35<br />
effect: <br />
slot 1: type 8 aug<br />
<br />
Nutsack<br />
100% weight reduction<br />
Giant size<br />
NODROP<br />
non-LORE<br />
<br />
Given that there are from 1 to 6 people per server at the moment that could make this item, it would not break the game, but would provide a nice boost in stats and status to those that have put in the work to do this.<br />
<br />
Another way to make the ultimate GM trophy desireable is to make it have an instacast buff that is useable from inventory.  This would make it great for pvp and so on.  Something like +5 mana/tick +5 hp/tick.  Like an upgraded phylactery effect.  Self-only, stacks with everything.<br />

<br />
How about since the players see it as a stature thing, a sign of respect, that the NPC's see it that way.  I have seen a lot of faction modifiers coming out since Luclin and I like the idea.  What about having a super combine or a subcombine that takes subs from all the other trades, all no drop, to make a signet to let NPC's who sell tradeskill supplies, offer reduced prices and/or maybe sells ingredients that have previously been only droppables from mobs.  Make them only sellable to us, like one NPC with the Wayfarers camp.  That would give something back to us and be unique.<br />
<br />
Or give us a quest for each trophy that we can turn into a recipe for a nicer piece of equipment or upgrade.  Like for instance, Brewing--Place your Brewing trophy, your Signet of the Merchant (gained by subquests with Brewing merchants in PoK), your Grandmaster's Elixir (275 trivial brewed potion), and your Engraved Royal Velium BreastPlate in a Brew Barrel=Breastplate of the &quot;Stout&quot; Heart.  You could have it improve an existing piece of equipment with a &quot;new&quot; recipe that only master traders can get, just like an augment.  Augments are just used to make existing equipment better, so make a recipe too.  YOu can determine what stats or modifiers it will give, but people would probably be interested in this idea because traders won't have to sacrifice a slot just to show off, they can use a piece of equipment they already use and adjust it to have a modifier for their favorite tradeskill.  <br />
<br />
Would it be easier to augment a 7 piece suit of armor than to design 7 new trophies--I don't know, but it sounded cool this morning.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">One request from the non-uber tradeskillers out there:<br />
<br />
I can't begin to do AG quests. Not because I don't have the tradeskilling, but because I don't have the FLAGS.  Not everyone can get into Elemental, you have to be in a serious guild to get elemental flagged, to my knowledge RZ has yet to be taken by a pickup raid.<br />
<br />
PLEASE, PLEASE, I am BEGGING do *NOT* require someone to be flagged to get the ultimate trophy.  There ARE those of us who are not elemental flagged, probably never will be, and content to play the game without being so, that would love a chance to make an ultimate tradeskill trophy. THIS is why I am saying don't put uber phat statz on this thing to make them want to force you to be uber-flagged to get it (like the AG quest series).<br />
<br />
From what I heard, only 20% of the EQ population is elemental flagged, that was one of the main gripes about the postponed expantion as I recall. The rest of us have other things to do besides EQ and don't have enough time to get into an elemental-flagged raid guild and get backflagged just to get this trophy.<br />
<br />
This is why I suggest that the stats are not something that will make it wanted during combat. Double the stats (including double the mod  :D ) and uncap the 252 limit and I'm good with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Suani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">I would like a super trophy that gives a 15% chance to not use some of the components in a way similar to the focus effect Reagent Conservation.<br />
<br />
I think this would be popular with tradeskillers of all levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Something that just occurred to me, folks.  We've been thinking all along of the super-trophy as a single item.  I don't see why this has to be so.<br />
 <br />
 One of the biggest arguments we've had in this thread has been whether the super-trophy should have stats, and if so, what should they be.  We haven't really been able to come up with a consensus on what stats would be valuable to the highest of high-end raiders without being over-powering to lower level players.<br />
 <br />
 Possibly a good way to settle this would be to make the super-trophy in two parts.  First, you get a &quot;display stand&quot; which summons bags and can be combined in a tradeskill container to get the skill-mod items.  This display stand has no stats by itself.  <br />
 <br />
 Second, you get a type &quot;any&quot; augment with some nifty stats.  Since this augment doesn't replace an existing slot (it just adds stats), it probably wouldn't be as powerful as a stand-alone trophy.  Still, it could be very nice and desirable to everyone without being overpowering.  Consider this set of stats:<br />
 <br />
 MAGIC ITEM / LORE / NO-DROP<br />
 +10 AC<br />
 +10 to all stats except CHA<br />
 +50 CHA<br />
 +10 to all saves<br />
 +50 hp / mana / endurance<br />
 <br />
 This balances the stats somewhere between the AG earring and the 8th shawl.  Since it's a type &quot;any&quot; augment, it would be useful to literally anyone.  The stats on it are higher than all augs I've heard of, save those you'd get from VERY high end raiding.  However, it's weaker than some droppable or easily obtainable class- or category-specific items in the game.<br />
 <br />
 If you make it so that you can get a new augment by hailing an NPC (like the Adventurer's Stone now), you even remove the penalty of losing the aug when you upgrade a piece of gear.<br />
 <br />
 What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

Well, at level 56, I really am not in great demand at the planar level FWIW...and my experience with pickup raids is crap.

It seems like there just are not many drops for clerics, and with the entire raid rolling on components I might as well sit back and play gems. Whether or not the random generater hates me or not, no clue I just know I have won 1 item in 2 years of pickup raids.

So unless the trophy is an augment, I could care less whether it has stats.  I would prefer it to be an augment so I could wear it at all times.  <br />
<br />
I do like the toolbelt idea, but not as a trophy.  I think the toolbelt should be implemented for anyone just like a keyring to free up inventory space.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of coin weight reduction.<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of granting a foraging bonus or allowing non-foraging characters to forage.  Heck, if we're going to do that, why don't we also get the ability to enchant, imbue, and make various forms of mana.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is the ability to make other cultures' items, perhaps at a lessor chance of success.  After all, you have mastered all the tradeskills.  It only makes sense that you would have a chance of making any tradeskill item in the game.  Of course, you would still have to use the cultural forges, so it could get dangerous.<br />
<br />
But what I would like to see the most are AA's just like JCM for every tradeskill.  JCM started out as a great idea but was turned into a stupid idea by only applying it to one tradeskill and only giving it to one class.  Talk about unfair.  Here's my idea of the way it should work:  You can't get your tradeskill's equivalent of JCM until you reach an unmodified skill of 250 in your tradeskill.  Once you do reach unmodified 250, you get a free first level in your tradeskill's equivalent of JCM; this is your reward for making that extra effort to reach unmodified 250 and it gives you a considerable advantage over people like myself who are only 252 smith's because of geerloks and such.  It also gives you a considerably better chance of completing your grandmaster trophy than those who aren't unmodified 250's.  Further, your grandmaster trophy will list on it your level of your tradeskill's equivalent of JCM.  People hiring you will then be able to see: 1) That you are in fact a 252 smith; and 2) That you have a considerably better chance of success than Joe Blow, who is only 252 because of his geerlok.  As you spend AA's to increase your levels of your tradeskill's equivalent of JCM, these increases will be reflected on your trophy for everyone to see.  Once you have reached unmodified 250 in all tradeskills and have made all the trophies, you trade the trophies in for a single grandmaster trophy that is an augment and that lists, by tradeskill, your level in that tradeskill's equivalent of JCM.</div></div><hr />

The Artisan's Staff<br />

Instead of adding multiple skill modifiers to the trophy, why not make a new modifier, Skill Mod: Artisan +5%.  Change the code so that the Artisan modifier is checked whenever any tradeskill modifier is looked at,  I can't imagine it would be that difficult of a change (sure several hours maybe, but nothing that is impossible.)  <br />
<br />
Since this is a dream trophy, make a new zone, just for tradeskillers.  The effect: Artisan's Haven is a gate spell that takes you to the Haven.  It would contain all vendored tradeskill components, no matter what expansions you have (excluding zone specific components like jumjum,)  multiple (MANY) tradeskill points (ie forges,) located in obvious locations (hello Abysmal Sea?)It would contain new quests specifically aimed at Grandmasters, maybe one day add quests which will give you a specialty in a tradeskill.  The only exit is a one way book dropping you into PoK (or the water in Cobalt Scar, haha.)<br />
<br />
The slots of type 9 would be tradeskill augments.  Where do you find them?  Why by doing quests from the Artisan's Haven of course.  Questgivers would identify what kind of augments you recieve.  Augment quests would be incremental, sort of like the Break in Communications quest.  Weak augments would require easy combines, or Abysmal Sea type quests.  Successive augments would require you to combine the previous augment with the successful combine of the current quest.  Hopefully the quest writers would come up with interesting story lines (adding NPC's to all locations from every expansion) and interesting ways to complete the quests (a la tempering the Katana blade in that quest I can't quite recall the name of.)<br />
<br />
And finally, best of all, the Artisan's Staff is a particle item.  I was thinking, floating dollar signs, spinning in a circle, surrounded by a red circle and a line running through it;  Or platinum coins, slowly drifting upwards and dissolving into the air.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">OK, I've decided to take a crack at summarizing my views in combination with what we have so far.  This is based on a combination of (what appears to be) a majority or consensus opinion, and my own ideas.  The aim of this summary is to provide a template that can be tweaked by the devs for implementing a super-trophy.  I am purposely ignoring the existing limitations of the game engine in putting together this template; I leave it up to the devs to decide whether the needed recoding to implement these ideas is feasible or not.<br />
 <br />
 The super-trophy has the following characteristics:<br />
 <br />
 Ability to make: <br />
 The super-trophy is the tradeskiller's epic.  It can only be made if you already have all seven general grandmaster items AND if you have 250 raw skill in all seven general tradeskills.  This incredibly high standard gives the devs a LOT more leeway in how powerful they can make the super-trophy.<br />
 <br />
 Form of the super-trophy:<br />
 I am in favor of splitting the trophy into two parts. The first is an &quot;Icon of the Master Tradeskiller&quot; that has no stats and is equippable in Primary, Secondary, Range, or Ammo.  It has the bag ability and is used to make tradeskill mod items, as discussed below.<br />
 <br />
 So long as you have the Icon of the Master Tradeskiller in your possession (either on your person or in the bank), you may hail an NPC and receive a &quot;Mark of the Grandmaster Artisan&quot;, a Type &quot;all&quot; augment with stats, as discussed below.<br />
 <br />
 How to make: <br />
 The consensus appears to be that this must be a quest or a no-fail combine.  The hard work has already been done; this is just a reward.  It may require additional resources or items, but these should be trivial to obtain; no farming, questing, or combines you can fail, and no flagging or level-based requirements.  Note that this doesn't mean that they must be free; this could act as a plat sink.  Bear in mind the costs already spent on making the seven trophies, though.  <br />
 <br />
 Also note that items with trivials under 50 are no-fail for people of skill 250, so the extra item(s) could have a trivial of 49 or less and be tradable.  This would make it similar to the Artisan's Seal for existing trophies.<br />
 <br />
 The most popular method appears to be a quest giver who will give you the combine container only if you are a 1750 tradeskiller (as with Aid Grimel, but requiring all seven checks at once).  You then place all seven trophies (possibly with another item, such as a &quot;Grandmaster's Seal&quot;) in the container and perform a no-fail combine to obtain the super trophy.  <br />
 <br />
 Once you have the super-trophy (on your person or in the bank), you may hail the NPC at any time and he will hand you an augment with stats, mentioned below.  If you remove the augment (for example, when upgrading an item), you may hail the NPC and he will hand you a new augment.  This is in line with the PoP charm, the LDoN Adventurer's Stone, and the &quot;Breakdown in Communication&quot; quest items and rewards.<br />
 <br />
 Tradeskill mods<br />
 You can place the super-trophy in any tradeskill container (alone) and combine it to get a no-drop, no-rent, lore item with an appropriate tradeskill mod.  For example, if you combine the super-trophy in a tailoring kit, you get back the super-trophy and a &quot;Tailor's Helper&quot;.  The &quot;helper&quot; items should have at least a 5% bonus to match the bonus on existing trophies, and 10% would be a nice gesture.  <br />
 <br />
 Consensus appears to be that the &quot;helper&quot; items should also improve your skill beyond the existing stat cap or reduce your chance to fail, as with the Jewelcrafting Mastery AA.  By the time you obtain this item, you know pretty much everything there is to know about crafting anything in all seven tradeskills.  Logic dictates that you should have an edge over people who have only specialized in one tradeskill.<br />
 <br />
 Summoned Bags<br />
 The super-trophy should have a right-click effect to summon bags.  These bags should be no-drop, NOT lore, and NOT no-rent.  The bags should also have 100% weight reduction to match existing bags.  One popular idea is to make the bags also provide some coin weight reduction.  I honestly don't think that 100% coin weight reduction would be game-breaking, and it would be a very appropriate reward for a tradeskiller.<br />
 <br />
 Stats<br />
 This is one of the most hotly-debated topics, as far as I can tell.  There is no real consensus on what stats are needed or even wanted on the trophy.  Therefore, this is entirely my opinion.<br />
 <br />
 I am balancing the stats on the super-trophy against those on the 8th Shawl, the Aid Grimel earring, and existing augments I've seen or heard of.  Based on those standards, I would suggest the following:<br />
 <br />
 +15 AC<br />
 +10 to all stats except CHA<br />
 +50 CHA<br />
 +75 hp / mana / endurance<br />
 +10 to all saves<br />
 (optional: some nifty but harmless worn effect that will help anyone.  Something like Plainsight.)<br />
 <br />
 This makes the item significantly better than what the average non-raider would expect to get.  Since it's an augment, the stats are weaker than if it were a stand-alone item. The boost in HP and saves is significant regardless of your level, and the stats will benefit non-raiding tradeskillers a great deal.  (If anything, I feel the stats are far too conservative, but I don't think it would be reasonable to ask for higher stats.)  I feel this is the best compromise set of stats that would appeal to as many players as possible.<br />
 <br />
 Physical Characteristics<br />
 The item should be size &quot;tiny&quot; or &quot;small&quot; for easy storage and light so that even monks would want to carry it around.  <br />
 <br />
 The standard thinking is that it should go in the PRIMARY, SECONDARY, RANGE, and AMMO slots, like current trophies.<br />
 <br />
 Making it a charm-slot item seems popular, but it would then conflict with the PoP charm popular with raiders, and some GoD charms I've seen.  <br />
 <br />
 With regards to appearance, the item part should have a unique and distinctive graphic, in line with the class-based epics (version 2, that is, with OoW).<br />
 <br />
 Quest Proposal:<br />
 This section is pretty much swiped wholesale from Demorgoth's post and modified a bunch. :) <br />
 <br />
 You say, 'Hail Craftmaster Rehtom'ned'<br />
 <br />
 Craftmaster Rehtom'ned says, 'Well hello there &lt;Your Name&gt;. Some people prefer to be the jack of all trades and the master of none. Others prefer to concentrate exclusively on but one trade and perfect their skill in that alone. A precious few however manage to excel in all of the tradeskill arts and become a [Master of all tradeskills]. Which whould you consider yourself?'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'I am the Master of all tradeskills'<br />
 <br />
 Craftmaster Rehtom'ned says, 'Incredible! I thought there were none of us left! I assume you have all your trophies to prove your skill? Good. I was really proud of mine, but unfortunately they took up far too much room in my bags while I was adventuring. I made a beautiful [display case] for my trophies and mounted them in an artistic manner.  It was still rather large to carry around while adventuring, so after some long searching I managed to find an old sage who showed me how to magically reduce the size of my display while enhancing the magicks of the trophies themselves.  I was sworn to secrecy and cannot share the secret, but if you have a display case of trophies you wish to have shrunk and enhanced, I would be happy to assist you.'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'I would like to get a display case.'<br />
 <br />
 (If you do not have 250 in all seven tradeskills)<br />
 Craftmaster Rehtom'ned says, 'While your skills are quite impressive, &lt;Your Name&gt;, I fear you have not yet mastered all tradeskills.  Come back to me when you have improved your skills and we will talk further.'<br />
 <br />
 (If you DO have 250 in all seven tradeskills)<br />
 Craftmaster Rehtom'ned says, 'I have taken it upon myself to make such cases for others who also have mastered all tradeskills.  Mount your seven Grandmaster items in this case and return it to me.  I will work the magic upon it for you.'<br />
 <br />
 You recieve an Empty Trophy Case.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Empty Trophy Case<br />
 MAGIC LORE NO DROP<br />
 Wt: 7.0<br />
 Capacity: 8 Size Capacity: Small<br />
 <br />
 Put all 7 tradeskill trophies into the Trophy Case and hit combine.  You get a Sealed Trophy Case.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Sealed Trophy Case<br />
 MAGIC LORE NO DROP<br />
 Wt: 20.0<br />
 <br />
 Hand the Sealed Trophy Case to Craftmaster Rehtom'ned.<br />
 <br />
 Craftmaster Rehtom'ned takes the sealed case from you, places it upon his work bench, and starts to chant in an arcane tongue.  The words are beyond your ken, but the feeling of powerful magic is inescapable.  Before your eyes, the trophy case shrinks as its magical essence is refined and extracted.  <br />
 <br />
 Craftmaster Rehtom'ned finishes his invocation and says, 'As promised, here is your Icon of the Master Tradeskiller. Place it in any artisan's crafting device and its magic will be invoked to aid you.  I was also able to isolate some of the enhancing magics from your trophies and make them into this Mark of the Grandmaster Artisan.  Should you ever lose it, come talk to me and I will see about getting you a replacement.  I hope these items serve you well and provide much needed room for all that ingredient collecting! May your supplies be plentiful and your crafting successful, friend.'<br />
 <br />
 You receive two items:<br />
 <br />
 Icon of the Master Tradeskiller<br />
 MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
 Slot: RANGE PRIMARY SECONDARY AMMO<br />
 Effect: Artisan's Satchel (Must Equip, Casting Time: 10.0)<br />
 WT: 0.1 Size: SMALL<br />

 <br />
 Later, you can hail Craftmaster Rehtom'ned.  If you have the Mark of the Grandmaster Artisan, he will reply:<br />
 Craftmaster Rehtom'ned says, 'Greetings, &lt;Your Name&gt;!  I hope your crafting goes well?'<br />
 <br />
 If you lost or destroyed your Mark of the Grandmaster Artisan, he will reply:<br />
 Craftmaster Rehtom'ned says, 'I see you have lost your Mark.  I will attempt to make you a new one.'  Craftmaster Rehtom'ned closes his eyes and chants.  You can feel his magic drawing upon the power of your Icon of the Master Tradeskiller, and a moment later, a new Mark of the Grandmaster Artisan appears in his hand.  He hands it to you and says, 'Wear it with pride, &lt;Your Name&gt;.'</div></div><hr />

Here's what I would be satisfied with in a supertrophy:<br />

<br />
stats: double that of the old trophies, equippable in the same slots<br />
summons the same bags as old trophies<br />

<br />
It should either give a 5% mod to all skills and consume the old trophies on the combine, or give no mods and return all the trophies on the combine.<br />
<br />
Here's what I would like in a supertrophy.<br />
<br />
Same quest, although all trophies are returned on the combine.<br />
stats: 10 all stats, 10 all saves, 100hp/mana, 10% to all tradeskills, with a useful effect like faerune, equippable primary/secondary/range/ammo and any slots where you could wear jewelry (rings, etc).  It should also summon the bag.<br />
<br />
Give your supertrophy back to the same NPC and he returns the trophy and an augment that is equippable in any slot.  The augment could be maybe 50hp/mana and some smaller stats and/or an all-around useful focus effect.  This portion could also be made into a quest; make one 250+ trivial item from each tradeskill and combine them in a container (this CAN fail).  Give the container and your supertrophy back to the NPC and receive your trophy and the augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Mahrk_Lonefeather</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">How will your trophy show what your skill level is? I'm confused.<br />
<br />
SFG<br />
<br />
Very simple.  The same way you show anyone any item in the game.  You link your trophy to whoever you want to show it to, and when they click on the link, it shows the item information including your level in your tradeskill's equivalent of JCM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">A more reliable proof is to equip it and have someone inspect you. Links can be easily sent from person to person, no drop items can rarely be transfered from one person's inventory to another's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Kieroth_whiteleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Right, but I was referencing the above person's post where he was saying it should say how much &quot;jcm aa&quot; and skill levels you have. Even linked items don't show how powerful they are to the person who HAS them, they scale to be proportional to the USER.  If a level 65 links his nightmarewood compound bow, and I click it, it shows reduced stats because I'm below the recommended level.<br />
<br />
If we're discussing a 1750 required item, the point is moot. Anyone who equips it is going to be 1750, so you KNOW their skill level. My question was solely to the person who wanted the item to show an exact skill number, which to the best of my knowledge is currently impossible. Obviously this is something that *COULD* be coded, but I don't know how worth the effort it is.<br />
<br />
I'd MUCH rather see something along the lines of jcm on the trophy than a skill modifier - given that a geerlok is just as good as a trophy at that point, it seems kinda a waste of time. I don't know if it's feasible, but it'd be much preferred to a skill mod, since we only effectively get a 1% bonus anyways once 1750. 10% is overkill, and they could put 100% on it without making it any more desirable than a geerlok.<br />
<br />
SFG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Mahrk_Lonefeather</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Actually, my suggestion was that it just show your JCM skill.  Since in my scenario you can't get JCM until you are a natural 250 tradeskill level, any showing of JCM on the trophy would tell the person you are a 250 tradeskill level.  However, I don't know anything about coding so don't know how much work that would be to have JCM show up on trophy.<br />
<br />
But then after more thought, I have realized that a person who is a 250 tradeskill level but below experience level 51, would not be able to get JCM.  Since tradeskills are not supposed to be experience level based, this would bring up an issue of fairness.  The logical fix would be to make JCM aa's non- experience-level based, so you could get them at any experience level as long as you had a tradeskill level of 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Mahrk_Lonefeather</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Actually, after more thought, tradeskills are somewhat experience level restricted as you can't become a member of the 1750 club until you start earning aa's.

Before anyone starts screaming too powerful look at what you have to accomplish to get to here.<br />
1.  Over a year in real life finishing your 250 plus a trophy in all 7 Tradeskills.<br />
2.  A huge amount of time getting to the Elemental Planes.<br />
3.  Then have to hope you are lucky on the roll of the dice while up there so     you can grab certain items to complete your Aid Grimel Quest Earring.<br />
4.  Then you have to hope you don't fail more than 50% of the time even when you have 220 in whatever tradeskill for the Aid Grimel Quests.<br />
5.  So add to that the fact that the hardest skill points in any of the tradeskills are the last 30 between 220 - 250.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts anyway,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Artisans charm<br />
This item increases in power the higher your tradeskills are.<br />
<br />
<br />
So it could be obtained by just about anyone with enough money to make all 7 trophies, but would be rather useless to them unless they got their skill high enough.<br />
<br />
Or maybe this should be something else entirely, just a thought anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>puttermouse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">I like the charm idea... my twist would be not to base it on skill but the number of recipies you have made. that way &quot;trash&quot; (not used for anything I.E. Root Beer Float) recipies would be worth something.. To be the ultimate trade skiller you need to make every recipe that your  race/class is capable of</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Kaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Personally, I'd like part of it to be something like a Type 8, charm slot aug, and add a type 8 aug slot to the PoP progression charm, along with the type 7 for the LDoN aug<br />
<br />
For each Tradeskill completed... (250 skill/hail NPC with Trophy equiped, or whatever code is best to handle it)<br />
<br />
+1 to all stats/resists, +10 mana/hp/end<br />
<br />
Smithing +13 STR, +13 Fire resist<br />
Fletching +13 DEX, +13 Poison resist<br />
Jewelcraft +13 CHA, +13 Magic resist<br />
Tailoring +13 AGI, +13 Disease resist<br />
Brewing +13 STA, + 30 HP, +15 Endurance<br />
Pottery +13 WIS, +13 Cold resist<br />
Baking +13 INT, + 30 Mana, +15 Endurance<br />
<br />
Recc level 60, required... 46?, to delay twinking with skills... Brewing would be easy for 30 HP at low levels if not recc level'd<br />
<br />
final stats, 100 mana/hp/end, 20 to all stats/resists.<br />
<br />
a point of mana regen for Jewelcraft, Pottery and Baking, and HP regen for Smithing, Fletching, and Tailoring, would be cool, and maybe +5 atk for each of Smithing, Fletching, Jewelcraft,Tailoring, and Pottery, for a total for 3 mana/hp regen, and +25 atk<br />
<br />
I'd also like to get a free AA point or such for mastering each skill, to offset the cost of tannan mastery... I have 18 less Combat effectivness AAs, that could have been put into Mental Clarity 3 and Water form 2, giving me 4 more mana regen... I'm already at worn mana regen cap, so the FT on Shawl/Earring won't help as much as it could.  Ideally, You'd get an AA point back at 200, 220, and 250 skill, making tannan mastery an 'investment' instead of a 'cost'</div></div><hr />

Oops sorry..I am thinking like a melee again. Okay add dodge, attack, and hp regen to caster earring also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Axemaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">id like to see the ability for a person with a 250 skill, and a trophy, to be able to make a No Drop Lore Augment for themselves, which has that skills  trophies skill mod and maybe *some* stats - i know it would be too overpowering to turn every trophy into an aug with the skill and stats, but maybe make all 6 or so augments match a single trophies stats.<br />
<br />
This would be a great incentive to hit 250 and would allow people to clear up bank space without losing the skill mod<br />
<br />
not quite a full trophy, but still a nice way to augment your gear and clear up bank space at the same time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>elemer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">Okay here's my 2cp worth of a reply.<br />
<br />
In order to get your grand master of all crafts trophy you get a quest bag and you do a no fail combine of all seven of the craft trophies.<br />
<br />
i.e. you have to have 1 ea of the normal trophies to make the final one.<br />
<br />
have the stats on end combine be similar to the aide grimal end items, and like wise have the time be tradeable so that melee's or casters have a version.<br />
<br />

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20379<br />
<br />
This would give access to a raid level item to non-raiders who were willing to take the time to become grand masters in all seven basic trade skills, while staying within the general scope of a pre-existing trade skill related quest and it's result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Dulsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">That's brilliant!  <br />
It's a pity there's no /toolbelt command where tools get flagged like keys do to your keyring. Would be nice to be able to buy that one commonly used cheap tool, /toolbelt it to have it consumed but added to your belt and then instead of checking just your inventory on combines it would also check your toolbelt.<br />
<br />
I LOVE THIS IDEA!!<br />
<br />
<br />
As for stats I would like a super trophy to have stats on a par with the earring but not require all the **** flags!<br />
<br />
I am close to being elemental flagged and one of the reasons I have been pushing to get there is the earring. It has been so frustrating looking at that earring and not being able to do it. <br />
<br />
Now that I am close to getting the upper levels of the earring I am wishing that the trouphy was something that is good enough to go back into my ranged slot.<br />
<br />
I think that stats equivelent to the 7th earring are not out of the question concidering the dificulty of getting this much skill. If you are worried about level 10 characters using it you can make it a level 60 recomended. That way it would scale up as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Dulsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Also let's point out the following item which is the result of a &quot;quest&quot;, the only part of the &quot;quest&quot; being that you loot the essence off AHR in VT and turn it in to some guy in Umbral. No skill required whatsoever to get what is if not the best, then one of the best, neck items in the game:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt; Rudeness removed.  Play nice. ~Lothay<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea the ho0ps you need to jump through to get this?<br />
Getting Keyed to enter VT is a massive effort and if you think it is easy get your level 10 twink flagged for VT and loot the most sought after item in the most restricted zone in the game ... .... ARGHHHH<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Actualy There is a great ability they could add to the super trophy<br />
<br />
Make it so that anyone with this trophy could buy items for 1% less than anyone else. Lord knows we have flushed our share of plat down the many holes of Norath. 1% wouldn't open up any serious exploits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>byelka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">I love this toolbelt idea.  <br />
<br />
I wanna take a crack on how to do it<br />
from what mechanics I  see in the game.<br />
<br />
How about for every tradeskill at 250<br />
you get 2 toolbelt slots (kinda like a<br />
backpack) but in its own UI.  If<br />
you get all 7 you get a bonus rather<br />
then 14 slots you get 20 slots.<br />
<br />
(OK the next is a guess on how they<br />
can implement it in game with the code<br />
as it is).  Now this new tool bank<br />
window you have goes with you<br />
wherever you go and its 100% wr so<br />
you don't have to worry about the <br />
weight of tool.  The only thing you<br />
can place in this tool bank are tools.<br />
They can somehow mark items as<br />
tools like they mark items for class<br />
diety.  So if you try to put something<br />
in their thats not a tool it just<br />
won't go in (like trying to put on<br />
a piece of armor that is diety specific<br />
and not your diety).<br />
<br />
Now you can put your tools like<br />
smithing hammers, needles, geerloks,<br />
trophies.  This gives you the option<br />
of adding future tools to it easily<br />
and swapping tools out if need be.<br />
<br />
And any geerlok or trophies bonus in<br />
their would apply to you it would be<br />
like wearing it.<br />
<br />
Now if you use the new tradeskill UI<br />
to do a combine it will first look<br />
for tools in this tool bank (and it <br />
will return the tool to the tool bank<br />
if autoinventoried) of course if<br />
you are experimenting you would<br />
have to manually take it out and use it.<br />
<br />
Does this sound like a good idea?<br />
<br />
And if so do any developers think it<br />
can even be implemented?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126"># Dodge: +15% <br />
<br />
OMG, that is SO overpowered LOL.  I would love to have a +15% dodge mod on my shaman, would make me never get hit.  <br />
<br />
I love the idea of  1% cheaper buying cost thing.  But perhaps instead of buying things cheaper, vendors BUY things from us for 1% more, kind of a &quot;Vendor's trust us, as we have bought so much from them already.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">OMG, that is SO overpowered LOL.  I would love to have a +15% dodge mod on my shaman, would make me never get hit.<br />
<br />
It depends on what the +15 means.  If it's an absolute increase in the percentage of dodges (I think it's ~6 percent normally, adding 15 to that would give you a 21 percent chance to dodge), than it's insanely overpowered.  If it increases your chance to dodge by 15 (relative) percent, it will take the chance to dodge from 6 percent to 6.9 percent.  Not a huge deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Damuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">The most realistic suggestions so far seem to be:<br />
<br />
5% (although if we want to limit it to 1750 tradeskillers, the mod could be 1%)mod on all skills (or increase skillcap to 252 so that no mods are necessary).<br />
<br />
Toolbelt<br />
<br />
component conservation<br />
<br />
summon lore no drop coin reducing bag<br />
<br />
Some sort of alternate title (Grandmaster Damuri or Archon Damuri the Artisan... we all get the idea)<br />
<br />
Uber faction with merchants so you get better prices than the rest of the world<br />
<br />
summon 100 wt (just too heavy to be of any practical use other than sit in your bank) no drop bags with more than 10 slots (say 12 slots) perhaps you can turn them in for a lore no-drop 12 slot 100% WR bag.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do we need to be 1750, just need 7 trophies or both?<br />
<br />
If we make the uber trophy too useful in gaming terms, every time flagged player will get there... trust me on this.  The same guys that will grind away and PL their characters to 65 in 3 days will have no problem with getting their tradeskills to 250 in a very short period of time.  All those &quot;casual tradeskillers&quot; that got to 220+ on all their tradeskills will soon become &quot;casual tradeskiller&quot; that got 250 on all their tradeskills.  We really need to keep the reward sub-elemental (as far as utility for XPing or raids).  I know too many people who went from ZERO tradeskills to 220 in all tradeskills for the AG quest in the last 6 months to believe that these same people wouldn't get themselves to 250 in all tradeskills (and lets face it, we are really talking about 5 tradeskills that require any effort at all and only 3 that are very difficult and only one that will drive you to drink).  These guys have a lot of plat (they never need plat for anything other than spell components or arrows etc.) cuz they get all their gear from raids.<br />
<br />
If I could get the title, the skill mod and the 12 slot bags, I would be happy.  If you want to put some stats on there, make sure the stats are not high enough to entice the mainstream (unless you think everyone should be in the 1750 club).</div></div><hr />
