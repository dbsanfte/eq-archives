<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ceks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to complete my Vah Shir Beastlord Sonic Wolf Bane weapon.<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated =)<br />
<br />
I currently have 10 of the &quot;Toughened Sinew Lashings&quot; for trade. I will also sell one for 5k, the approximate cost for me to train a twink in the appropriate skil if you do not want to trade (hint hint I want to trade) =)<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated, if you need help killing stuff in the moor to get the ingredients to make your piece I will even help with that. I just want to finish this quest =)<br />
<br />
I need:<br />
<br />
Sonic Wolf Bane Poison<br />
Reactive Sealent Soke<br />
Porous Claw Blade<br />
Ceramic Sleeves <br />
<br />
I think that is all. So I pretty much need all the stuff from other classes Please help =)<br />
<br />
Have a great day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once Hollowshade Moor is in working order I'll whip up another batch of warrior bits... it's just a pain to do since I'm only on one account so I gotta camp out to my twink every time a peice drops while keeping him in a relatively safe spot so he doesn't get smacked (Deliberately kept him at lvl 8 so that he doesn't need corpse runs but has at least a little HP to him)<br />
<br />
I'll inform the shaman, bard, and rogue that I know that you need their peices and have them contact you if they have the time to make more parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ceks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heya Kitchi,<br />
<br />
Thanks, I appreciate any help in finishing this quest =).<br />
<br />
The moor was actually reset last night I noticed. I was hunting there around 11:00 PM PST. All three factions were up fortunately. I was able to get enough parts for two success on the Toughened Sinew Lashings.<br />
<br />
So, if your friends need the beastlord part, I have them ready for trade (I will make 3-4 extras for future Sonic Wolf Bane questors as well.)<br />
<br />
Since they gave EQ a windows mode, I have been able to log in both of my accounts (using alt-tab to switch, then alt-enter to re-maximize to play) I can only play one at a time, but I can switch between my two accounts. Makes it easy to trade items for storage =)<br />
<br />
Have a great day, see you online =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pojodan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Myeh, I'm at work so I don't doubt that the Moor will be messed up by the time I get home.  Will just hafta get on right after the server maintainences on Monday night.<br />
<br />
Ugh.. I'm so sick of killing sonic wolfs and grimlings (At least none of the warrior bits take owlbear parts)<br />
<br />
Well, I gave the bard, shaman, and rogue one of my peices, so they probably don't need another Beastlord bit unless they want to use it for bartering purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ceks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just wanted to say Thank You again Kitchi, for all your help in getting the Warrior part of the Sonic Wolf Bane weapons. LMK if you need help with any quests. I owe you =)<br />
<br />
All I am missing now are the following:<br />
<br />
Reactive Sealant Soak (bard produced)<br />
Ceramic CLAW Sleeve set (Rogue Produced) <br />
<br />
I I think I am set. <br />
<br />
I tried getting one of the Grimling Spiritists to give me his staff last night, but they all kept saying something about loaning their staves to the Chief for some ritual. I could not talk to the chief about it however, as he was in Council with a Wood Elven Druid last night. The council session seemed to be taking quite a while, so I will check back with him tonight, or tomorrow morning =)<br />
<br />
Thanks again =)<br />
