<br />
My wife Yennia Tocs recently needed to make a Vale Sewing Kit in order to continue learning tailoring.<br />
<br />
 :( <br />
<br />
We did not realize JUST how EXPENSIVE this would be.<br />
<br />
She had a 56 smithing skill....<br />
<br />
She now has a 111 smithing skill....<br />
<br />
 :( <br />
<br />
This required some serious plat expenditures.<br />
(geerlok smithing hammer, celestial essence for embroidery needles, etc)<br />
<br />
Then we tried to make the sewing kits.<br />
<br />
4 attempts at 56 skill.... all failed...<br />
<br />
4 attempts at 111 skill.... 2 failed with 2 successes....<br />
<br />
The Vale Sewing Kit is NOT TRIVIAL at 111 and is 50% success, including the use of a geerlok hammer, there as well. (it's reported to be trivial AFTER 159 but no one seems to know WHEN it becomes trivial)<br />
<br />
We had already bought 4 small bricks of HQ ore up in the Bazaar from the vendor (6 or so plat each brick) to make the HQ Metal Bits required after we got her to 111 skill. (having made 100 celestial essence and 100 attempts at embroidery needles and still coming up 11 points short of the needles trivial level)<br />
<br />
So we decided to make the remaining HQ metal bits into Kits after we (luckily) made the Kit on the 5th attempt (the first at level 111 smithing).<br />
<br />
So we have -ONE- extra Vale Sewing Kit.<br />
<br />
It's a rotten bag. 4.0 weight 10 slot LARGE 0% WR.<br />
<br />
It's dropable/tradeable and not lore.<br />
<br />
If you want/need a Vale Sewing Kit for Halfling Cultural Sewing and don't want to waste 3-6 hours and 400-100 plat gaining skill as a smith....<br />
<br />
THIS OFFER IS FOR YOU....<br />
<br />
WTS Vale Sewing Kit. 500 pp (or 20 High Quality Brute Hides)  :D<br />
<br />
We can be contacted in game by looking for<br />
Sendar<br />
Yennia<br />
Marillia<br />
Nexare<br />
Rexer<br />
<br />
Or by email at rexer_kage@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
(if you want to commission the making of a Vale Sewing Kit, after we sell the first one, we can probably work something out)</div></div><hr />
