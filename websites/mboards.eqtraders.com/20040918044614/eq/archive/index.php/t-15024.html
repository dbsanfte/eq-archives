<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lonewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was trying to make Beer-Battered Cragbeast meat tonight, I put the 1lb cragbeast meat and the beer based batter in a mixing bowl and when I hit combine it says I cannot mix in this container? I Dbl checked the site and it clearly says that I need those 2 items in a mixing bowl. Did they maybe screw this up in the last patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Before you sauce up any of the GoD meats, you have to combine them in a mixing bowl until they are just plain meat.  If there is any weight listed on the meat, then combine it again in the mixing bowl alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Doebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Steps for making GoD baking recipies<br />
In the following, XX can be any of the 4 GoD meats<br />
<br />
1) Break down &gt;1lb  XXmeats into 1lb XX meats.<br />
     Put &gt;1lb XX meats into a mixing bowl, alone, and hit combine. Graphics doesn't change.<br />
<br />
2) Convert &quot;1lb XX meat&quot; to just &quot;XX meat&quot;<br />
     Put &quot;1lb XX meat&quot; into a mixing bowl, alone, and hit combine.<br />
Graphics will change to match that of a &quot;chunk of meat&quot;<br />
<br />
3) Make the sauce of your choice in the brew barrel<br />
<br />
4) Combine &quot;XX meat&quot; and sauce<br />
      Back to the mixing bowl. put 1 &quot;XX meat&quot; and 1 sauce in the mixing bowl, hit combine.  You will get something like &quot;Barbequed Cragbeast Meat&quot;<br />
<br />
5) Final combine.<br />
     Finally, to the grill. Put the sauced XX meat of your choice, plus additional ingrediants as needed into an oven or spit, and cross your fingers.</div></div><hr />
