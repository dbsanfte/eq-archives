<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Iceclad Ocean for Iceclad cutlassfish. You may also want to combine 3 for the cutlassfish oil and sell it that way. The oil is LORE so be sure not to make an extra one.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Scar for Cobalt Cod. If you have brewing skill you may even want to make them into oil and charge more that way. It also insures that you do not accidentally eat any.<br />
<br />
Plane of Nightmare if you are level 46+ for Nightmare Chiclids (or something like that)<br />
<br />
Plane of Valor if you are 55+ for Valorium Discuss (again, or something like that)<br />
<br />
Ocean of Tears for saltwater seaweed. This used to be no drop, but I think I heard that was changed. I'm not human so i never cared enough to check.<br />
<br />
Sebilis for Kunzar Koi. Under the first bridge is a nice peaceful fishing spot which happens to be where I got skill (200) just before making some Crucibles of Escape with pottery.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are a few other good fishing spots too, but those are the ones that came to mind for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dryade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Err, I'd love to go to all those places.. but i forgot to mention i'm only level 33, and that's my main... Iceclad would likely work best. Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saltwater Seaweed used to be both no-drop and not stackable.  A few months ago, it was made tradable and stackable.  It can be fished in both OoT and in Timorous Deep.<br />
<br />
Whatever you decide to fish for, PLEASE remember that the folks buying your fish (or seaweed, heh) are tradeskillers who are perpetually strapped for cash.  I wince every time I see a single Saltwater Seaweed or one Mug of Sea Foam for 100pp in the bazaar.  I kid you not, folks, some people in the bazaar actually expect skillers to pay 300pp just for temper components (which you can lose in a subcombine!), never mind the other 100-200pp in smithing components, for a single attempt at a skillup.  This is not reasonable pricing.  Heck, even Mistletoe sickles become cheaper at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Graiilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can go to the gulf of gunthark to do some fishing ...you can use the Gunthark Grouper and the Eel in baking reciped...some items like the Jellyfish can be used in poisons ... but regardless if you so choose you can just turn around and sell the stuff right back to the vendors for almost a PP a piece</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm.. Where is a safe place to fish in Gunthunk.. (sorry for spelling.. cant spell for crap:( )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you keep an eye out for trains, you can fish right near the lighthouse.  The place where you run down to the water to get to Gunthak Beach is a safe spot, so long as no one trains across the water (and yes, I've seen mobs make it all the way across to the lighthouse before).  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The safest place I have found is at the left edge of the beach from the lighthouse. If you put yourself right at the wall you are out of aggro range of the leftmost beach pop. If you are of sufficient level you can fish and take out the 3 mobs that spawn at waters edge. The middle one is a PH for Mokon Brokenskull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Doebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another safe spot in Gunthak.<br />
<br />
From the lighthouse island. There is a chain of rocks that connects the island to the zone wall. Run out the the far rock and fish away.<br />
<br />
Don't foget to forage if you can. The foraged stuff out of Gunthak is worth a fair bit to the NPC merchants as well.<br />
<br />
There is also a pleasant little ogre merchant in the lighthouse that will sell you more bait when you run out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't forget, with OOT, one gunthak mackeral + 1 skinning (or is it filleting?) knife = 5 bait (in a tacklebox - triv 26)...<br />
<br />
GREAT way to cut down on the cost of bait (even though its cheap and you can get it via foraging, also)<br />
<br />
And while you're fishing bring a backpack full of sauces or batwings to work on baking, too!<br />
<br />
(Fish fillets (triv 82) and fish rolls (triv 135?) - both also sell fairly well (inexpensive) at the bazaar, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the Gulf of Gunthak.  I fish on the row of rocks near the lighthouse. <br />
<br />
With a 200 skill I can net 75-100pp an hour selling back to the merchants in the lighthouse.  You can buy poles and bait there as well, which is very convenient.<br />
<br />
Probably the best no-risk income in the game that doesn't depend on other players.</div></div><hr />
