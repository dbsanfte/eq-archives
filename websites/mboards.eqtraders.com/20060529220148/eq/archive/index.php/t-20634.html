<br />
If I was a dev, I would certainly consider Spirit of Sloth to be a prime candidate for trivial &quot;adjustment&quot; (hmmm, hope I'm not putting ideas in their heads!).<br />
<br />
At 275 skill with a 5% adjustment, you have as near-as-makes-almost-no-difference 95% chance of doing the OoW augmentation combines.<br />
<br />
It took me around 5 hours and 15k plat to go from 50 to 255 without having to move from the spot I was standing (had a shammy next to me to buff charisma and dex).<br />
<br />
Of course, getting the components for the augs is another story....</div></div><hr />

My rogue is around 50 as well.  Where were you standing?</div></div><hr />

One guy sells the creepers and sealed vials, and another the solvent and sealed vials. I just stood between them and did lots of clicking. Cost of successes and fails is around the same because you get the vial back on a fail.<br />
<br />
Skill-ups came pretty regularly and, although I didn't count exactly, it was around one per stack at the higher skill levels.</div></div><hr />

Did you do all SoS?  I had found a guide that tells me to make Athropic Sap to 98, then Calcium Rot to 172 and then SoS to 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">miakiss</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I skipped the Calcium Rot, but you would save a little plat and skill up a bit quicker if you go to Abysmal Sea and use that recipe.<br />
I stayed in PoK because it was easier to keep my dex/cha buffed up that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">03-06-2005, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I realized the level caps were gone, I changed my bazaar mule into a gnome rogue and leveled to 20.<br />
<br />
Abysmal Sea was a bit better for me, since I could buy all the components from a single merchant.<br />
<br />
A normal level 20 rogue will have much lower dex and no buffs.  So he can expect to spend at least twice as much time and twice as much money as you did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plowed my way to 264.  Did Athropic Sap to 98, Calcium Rot to 172 and then SoS to 264.  Spent a little over 20K doing it.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm debating weather to drop another couple K to get to 275, or just forget it, and see what the next patch or two brings in the way of changes.  <br />
<br />
I haven't looked at skill ups from 275 to 300 yet.  If it's easy to farm (for a 62 druid) then I may just keep going to 300.  We'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akishka</div><div class="date">03-06-2005, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some scorpion things in OT that my 55 druid cleaned up without issue :)  Drop rate wasn't fantastic, like 15 minutes between exploring and looting 4 of them but I started moving faster towards the end as I got the hang of it.  That plus some storebought stuff makes Soul Burn, trivial 302.<br />
<br />
Although, doing the grandmaster's assasin seal quest, I found everything but the scorpion venom vendor diving in PoK.  Most of those trivialed over 300 as well so I would recommend looking up the quest and just keeping a list of what you need on hand.</div></div><hr />
