<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thistleborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im almost maxed in Fletching but arrows are kind of pointless since I got a Tolan Bracer.  I thought I would make Fish Darts for the fun of it and max throwing skill to ;).  My question is, de-boning a fish in the tackle box based off of Fishing skill (currently working on that) or Baking skill?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

There SERIOUSLY needs to be a recipie to get Fish Bones that doesn't require me to make Prepared Fish.  Think Real World here people.  I have a fish flopping around on my table and I want it's bones.  I sure as frell do not need to pull out some herbs and spices to help me extract them.  The 6.0pp per bone requirement becuase I have to pay for the Roots and Herb is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
That said, I just made 1000 Fishbone Darts before I knew about High Quality Fish Bones.  **** **** ****.  I would have been fishing in Firona Vie had I know &lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />

Trivials at 162, hence you can get skill ups until that point.</div></div><hr />
