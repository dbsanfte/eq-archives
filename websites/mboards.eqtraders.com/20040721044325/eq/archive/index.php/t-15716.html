<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DaluinRizzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize you do a TON of work keeping this place going, and many people appreciate it!<br />
<br />
That said,  there is a DIRE NEED for a site like this for other games, such as:<br />
<br />
- Final Fantasy XI (this actually exceeded the EQ number of subscribers).  It is lacking in good detailed crafting sites!<br />
<br />
- Horizons. Heck this game is all about crafting<br />
<br />
- and many more<br />
<br />
Have you ever considered becoming the &quot;portal&quot; for all things crafting related in MMORPG's?<br />
<br />
I realize that this stuff takes time (and huge bandwidth I am sure), but even starting with message boards dedicated to crafting for each game might be a start.  In fact, a good deal of &quot;guides&quot; will probably be user contributed just as some are now for EQ.<br />
<br />
Just a thought... A thought that I can safely guess you probably already had, but why not bring it up again :)   My current game has been FFXI, and other than allakhazam there isn't much good out there, especially tradeskill related!<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Niami, Ngreth, and the gang have said MANY times, that they will NOT be hosting a site, nor becoming officially involed in EQ2, WoW, FFXI, SWG, or anything else other than EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heck, it's even in the FAQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And the other problem.<br />
<br />
We do not play FFXI not Horizons... nor anything other than EQ and SWG... SWG has a good site (http://www.swgcraft.com) so we are not needed there.  So we have no real idea how the crafting in these other games go.<br />
<br />
If we start doing a portal, where we have to get other editors... other programers... etc... we will start having to pay people :/  at that point... we have to start running ads, or *force* a premium site... and that just kills one of the things we want to avoid.  It may be posible to do such a thing with volunteers... but then you end up with the problem of volunteers just disapearing, and you sudenly have one of the &quot;games&quot; with no-one running it or someone who knows nothaing about that game running it.<br />
<br />
So unfortunately... for those games... someone else is just going to have to step up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DaluinRizzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Understandable...<br />
<br />
I appluad the fact that this place is free.<br />
<br />
I probably use this site and allakhazam for most all my needs,  in fact I pay for allakhazam with no problem, and I would pay for this site too if you started charging for premium service.</div></div><hr />
