<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xerno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ugh there has been a serious drought for the past few days in the bazaar over here. Out of the last 5ish days I only saw spider silk / silk swatches for sale once, 250 silks @ 7pp. Before I got to the vendor they were all gone :(<br />
<br />
Soooo... I'm gonna be farming for silks whenever they arent available because I'm just about done with all my skills except tailoring, what is the best place to go?<br />
<br />
Thx :)<br />
<br />
PS: I can farm any mob within reason, had no trouble soloing the PoValor mobs for sacred waters, so I don't care how tough it is. I just want the highest drop rate possible (keep respawn in mind, LGuk owns but the respawn sucks lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Candien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crag spiders in EK, or as you say, LGuk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used to take my Rog to FV, now I take my druid and drag along a wizard friend.  Takes too long with my rog.  <br />
<br />
Fun zone to AoE, since the only thing on one side of the zone is spiders.  Make yourself comfy in a corner and drag all the spiders you can see - they run fast so losing them should not be a problem.  Boom, and save the honey berries.  <br />
<br />
Not as many silks as other zones, but a heck of a lot more spiders / pp.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely go to EK. Crag spiders have been know to drop 1-6, and very rarely I believe 8 silks.  Just make sure to keep killing everything in the zone and not just the spiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree about FV, the Dreadland tunnel vicinity.  Those drachnids are all over the place, and even though silk drop rate is much lower (0-2 silks per kill) than off crags, the high kill volume more than makes up for it.  My personal experience with EK is that anytime I go there, there are 3-4 druids/rangers hogging every spider in sight, and if I am very lucky, and keep running all over the zone, I might end up with 4-5 kills per hour.<br />
<br />
FV by DL tunnel is literally infested with drachnids.  All I need is sit on my horse, tag drachnids with tash, and let my pet do the rest.  Half an hour later, I head out with 3-4 stacks of silk, and a couple hundred pp to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ZealSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">drachnids are a good thing for most classes to farm, but might not be the best for rogues.  I think most of the drachnids are rangers so they all put damage shields up.  should not be a problem at 65 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>filobeto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ding ding ding, Zeal gets the prize.  That's the MAIN reason why it took so long with my rog.  I'd literally kill myself beating them down, then I'd have to clicky heal up.  6k hps seem like a lot when the mobs hit you very rarely, but inflicting self damage every swing adds up, and fast.  <br />
<br />
This is certainlly not the camp for the solo rog.  Wine and dine a silk - pull the zone to them and loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EK and FV are definitely good places.  Heart Spiders in Guk (upper or lower, haven't been in a while so can't remember.)<br />
<br />
South Ro isn't too bad either.  When I was hunting the AC, I would regularly gather up all the spiders and AE them.  Would get lots of the newbie armor junk, but also got quite a few silks.  Also killed lots of pumas for the skins, and everything else that moved, especially rares (for the AC of course.)<br />
<br />
And then I popped the AC and smacked him down hard. :)<br />
<br />
If you are going to be in South Ro anyways, whether it's for the  AC, a GuK LDoN adv, or hunting the Ghoul of Takish Hiz, kill every spider you see, while you wait.  (And if the Terrorantulas show themselves, make an Erudite tailor happy, too.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yitan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Recently, found a great place to farm Spider silk. Dunno about your server, but in AB, Nagafens Lair is empty: Noone hunts there anymore, so, the spiders just before Giants are a great source.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xerno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Keep in mind though that some of my twinks are 65 Cleric, 65 Shaman, 58 Druid :) Thanks for the info guys, gonna prolly try out EK and FV when there arent any in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xerno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hehe well I went to SolB first, and I end up clearing the spiders and having 15 mins left for each spawn round =\ Been killing FGs and Efreeti PH for fun heh. This would be great if there were endless spawns but they run out way too fast</div></div><hr />

Must We Endure?  <br />
<br />
Zand, it's a question - you may think it's stupid that it is asked again, but it's legit.  <br />
<br />
I suppose we could make light of your questions, even the ones that have been repeated -  please try hard not to hit the reply key when you have a problem with a question.  Either answer, or move on to the next post.<br />
<br />
Again, gratz on 250 - just try to remember all the questions you had when you were &lt;100.<br />
<br />
/salute</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was farming spiderling silks in Innothule the other day when a ranger showed up to do likewise.   Being a wizard, my method of farming deep greens is to pull as many as I can find, then PBAoE them, 20 or 30 at a time.   The ranger had the gall to tell me that it was &quot;not nice&quot; to pull more than one spiderling at a time.  I told them that I was just farming the way my class farms, and that killing individual spiderlings one at a time was not practical for a wizard (especially one who has deleted all the baby nukes from his spellbook)  They then threatened to start &quot;picking off&quot; spiderlings I had pulled.  So I told them if they did, they'd get /reported.  <br />
<br />
Only afterward did I realize the reasoning behind their complaint.  Pulling a crowd of spiderlings -but not killing them- was screwing up their ability to track... thus putting them on an even footing with me as far as farming (ie, run around and look).   Poor baby!<br />
<br />
I suppose an aggressive person who doesnt mind angering other players could intentionally use this tactic when faced with &quot;hogging&quot; trackers.  It wont get you on their good side when you try to get foraged goods from them, though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaasper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/feedback Give us an all spider zone for farmage like ya did for skins.<br />
<br />
EK - Great drop per spider but the spiders are too few and the spawn table gets filled with trash kills.<br />
FV - Spiders only drop 1 or 2 if they drop anything at all.<br />
Guk - (This was my favorite) There is only 1 guk and 1000 tailors.<br />
<br />
Im looking for a zone like Jagged Pines only with spiders instead of animals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as that zone includes both Spiders and Spiderlings !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've farmed EK many times with various combinations or solo on my 54 druid, 65 shaman, 65 SK, 60 monk.  Even if you have the place completely to yourself and can kill at the pace of a level 65, don't expect too much more than 100 silks per hour, really more like somewhere between 80 to 120.  100 is very fair though, and very much the usual.  I've never seen a crag spider drop 8 silks, but have seen them drop 7 plus a spell.  So 8 is possible.  Seen carrion spiders drop 4 at a shot too, so kill them also.<br />
<br />
Great place, but competition can make it silly.  If it's too crowded and you're competing with rangers or bards who can track, you're kind of screwed. <br />
<br />
Especially since very few people hunting anything ever kill placeholders; they'd rather wait an hour for a pop than kill a few mobs and force a pop.  <br />
<br />
I go there and kill stuff like crazy, which is great when I'm one of the few there to loot the results.  But when I do it just so some tracker can thank me by zapping the mobs I spawn by killing placeholders...grrr!<br />
<br />
By the way, the snakes are placeholders for the spiders.  But kill everything -- I have no idea what is a placeholder for the snakes!  And you can get quite a lot of medium and high quality cat pelts while you're there.  Bring a skinning knife and a sewing kit and you can skin them so they all become stackable low quality pelts, or just keep them and use or sell them.  Or...bring a bunch of silk threads and just make a leather padding every time you loot a cat pelt -- and you'll loot tons.  I've gotten three quality pelts at a time off the lions there.  Hounds and different wolves drop wolf pelts too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dippen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I love EK for farming silk. I go there and kill spiders and anything else that crosses my path til I see a griff on tracking ( druid here).<br />
 The dire charm a griff, if you have dc, and I use the have griff attack any trash mob I see while I track down spiders. <br />
     After a hour or so of this you will start to see less spiders, just stop tracking spiders ( kill any that come into your line of sight though) and slaughter your way all over the zone. Kill every snake, lion and wolf you can find for 20 mins and that zone will be loaded with spiders for you. <br />
   And in the chance someone is in EK getting exp, tell them you will give a full set of buffs in exchange for silk, a lot people will do that for ya.</div></div><hr />
