<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started fishing last night and my skill got to level 10 very quickly. At what point does it slow down? It seemed every other cast my skill raised.<br />
btw- I just got the Fisherman's Companion. I drank 2 Ales and the screen got wavey and I had trouble walking. I guess Alcohol Tolerance is something I must work on too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has been a really long time since I've fished for a skill up, but I think it slows down around 150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It does slow down, but it seems to pick up again eventually. At least, it did for me. <br />
<br />
I had problems getting skill-ups in the mid-150's, but I got around 5 skill-ups a few days ago while fishing in OOT. (Averaged about 1 skill-up per stack of bait. In the mid-150's, I was averaging 1 skill-up per 4 or 5 stacks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Who cares? <br />
<br />
It's fishing. If you are very very very very unlucky it will cost you 1pp per skill up. Plus if you carry a pack full of bait around you can often work on it while waiting for something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trixzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was fishing in PoS for the salmon because I have been working baking. I took 6 stacks of bait with me, had a skill of 195 when I started. Out of the six stacks, I caught 25 Storm Salmon and 61 Fresh Fish. I also got my last 5 skill points :-)<br />
<br />
The only slow down that I noticed was around 165-180.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dizn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Does the location where you fish determine how often you gain skill ups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's been a heckavu long time, but I do remember that 195-200 was rough, with 199 the toughest.<br />
<br />
The place you fish shouldn't make any differnce, at least from what I remember, but it seems it's like a typical Tradeskill; from 190 to 200 will take some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Draggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The closer you get to 200, the slower it goes (unless the RNG likes you).<br />
<br />
Each step will be the longest, I was stuck at 189 for about 2 weeks, and finally broke 190, then 191 a few weeks later.<br />
<br />
If you really want to boost it high, expect to sit someplace (get a nice beach chair) with lots of bait, and fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>centx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only p[lace I have ever fished is kaladim while picking muchrooms for KC's I usually do it in aboiut 3 hour sittings once a week. In about12 hours I went from 0 to 198 fishing. I have also yet to break a single fishing pole. while I will eventually fish in other zone's eventually to assist with my other tradeskill's this just seemed like a good way to pass the time while picking mushroom's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eoghnved</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My fishing skill has slowed down tremendously because I've been fishing in Abysmal Sea.  It doesn't take many casts to fill up my inventory with tuna and crab, so I only fish for a short time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rabdos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Isn't fishing skill level capped?</div></div><hr />
