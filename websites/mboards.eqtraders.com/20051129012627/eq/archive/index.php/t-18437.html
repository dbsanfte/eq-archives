The upgrade process (after the initial jewelcrafting combine) has parallel recipe's in poisonmaking and alchemy for every step except making Amber Resin.  For this you must find a rogue.  I suggest that everyone send feedback to SOE to add this recipe to the medicine bag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not the very best solution though, but works for me.</div></div><hr />

OH OH! 1 more thing :) Please remind them AGAIN about the many new t-skill items that aren't sporting a t-skill tag.<br />

thank you <br />

P.S. doh.. um... I hate the nerf-bat, no matter which way it swings. If any proposed solution includes RAISING the trivial, even if it is for rogues:), then this shaman would tell them forget it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a guess from a fellow tradeskiller but is it because rogues and shaman can both reach 151? :)  You don't have any actual difference between skill levels until you get to the 200 cap on alchemy.  Now you may argue that the rogues can get further above the trivial than shaman but its still trivial to both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess in some orwellian-inspired way i'd just like to see them wrap up this aug business with some parity. Looks like i'll have to haul my drag-bot rogue out of PoK &amp; back to cr duty again. Had no problem with the amber resins :/<br />

<br />
There is a thread in the Omens forum specifically for players to report in tradeskill items that have no tradeskill tag.  There's too many for me to keep track of.<br />
<br />
With regards to other issues that you want the devs to look into, the best bet is to feedback via the SOE Developer's Corner or such.  (I am in regular contact with the devs about outright bugs, and things that seem noticeably out of whack, but I cannot and should not be the funnel point for everyone's issues - too many of you folks, and too many wishlist items.  If I jump on too many bandwagons, I will not have their ear anymore - they'll flee in terror every time they see me instead of just wincing when they see another email from me.)  ;)</div></div><hr />
