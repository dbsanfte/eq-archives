Since I'm not a dr00d I'm gonna buy my silks (please, no letters saying &quot;dr00dz are people too!&quot; :P ).<br />
<br />
I don't want to raise the price of silks by buying up all there is so I'm trying to do it piecemeal.  What's a reasonable price for silks?  I've been paying no more than 5pp each.  Is this too much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LadyAz</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is more than the 20pp per stack pre-bazaar days. But 5pp is the most I will pay as well.<br />
<br />
Recently most of my silks have come from &quot;shopping&quot; the NPC merchants the first few days after patch days. Yeah it may only be 2 or 3 here and there.. but it adds up quickly.  I have enough for over 100 robe attempts (over 500 tailoring combines total) as soon as I get my 3rd AA ding.<br />

 :oops:  hehe I'm a druid and I bought all my silks (at 5-10pp each even).  However, when I was doing it, robes still sold for a decent enough amount for me to recoup my investment and make some money at it, which is now funding my quest to GM all the other skills.  Therefore, it wasn't worth my time to farm silks.<br />
<br />
But at the current prices, stick with 5pp.  You can get plenty that way.  Look for silks each time you are in the bazaar, and save until you have enough for a session of combines.</div></div><hr />
