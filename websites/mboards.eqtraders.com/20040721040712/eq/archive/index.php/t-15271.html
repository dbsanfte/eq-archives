<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Narrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone thought that there was a quest in Ogguk (or near by) that you could take pelts and increase their quality.  I have searched all over, and have yet to get it confirmed.  I would think if that it was possiable it would be in this forum *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think there is a frog in Gukta that does this. I dont remember the name tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heartsong_Steelsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is an npc in Gukta named Forager someone.  He will only increase low and better, and he takes three to make one.  Only works for wolf/cat/bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Narrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you, so much for finding ruined pelts to make low qual for padding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lord Grimrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Frogluks name is Dar Forager Lumanes, Sometimes he is in Gukta, sometimes he is wandering in Innothule. He will take 3 pelts and give you one better  in return.<br />
<br />
He will not take ruined pelts<br />
He will only take bear, cat, and wolf pelts.<br />
<br />
You will only ever get back MQ or HQ pelts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Isembold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dar Forager Lumen does walk out of the city to roam the swamp. When he is in the city he stands just outside the alcove where the soulbinder is. This is just inside the city to the left before you cross the canal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, yes, you can buy all the LQ/MQ bear pelts in the bazaar for 2-4p/ea and turn em into 30-50p HQ pelts or backpacks very easily.<br />
<br />
You may have to spend some time in Gukta vendor diving, or outside killing spiderlings and zombies until Dar Forager gets back.</div></div><hr />
