Are these something you'd want to continue hosting, and just have links to from EQTC?  Or are they something you'd consider HTMLizing once you get more feedback, and having them hosted here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">byelka</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love (once I get some feedback on them) for them to be htmlized (which I think you can auto do in exel even) then have you host them as leveling guides if you wish.<br />
<br />
A lot of the information was gleemed from this web site  :D <br />
<br />
You have done a great job here and it would have not been possible to make these guides without your help.<br />
<br />
There are a few things that are missing in them such as the names and the sell back prices for JC above 202 since I can't really successfully make those things but I do have the recipes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calabar</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I’ve only looked over your brewing guide.  I started with brewing because it’s the only skill I’ve taken to 250 thus far, and it’s likely to be the least complicated of all the guides.  Just about every guide and post I’ve read has had slight variations on what’s the best path to take.  For example, I made skull ale and never made Ol' Tujim's Fierce Brew.  But overall I fallowed the same path as you suggest in your guide.  The only point I’d argue with is your suggestion for the last two skill points.<br />
<br />
Champagne is expensive to make and requires the services of an enchanter and a high level jeweler.  I would highly suggest making Kaladim Constitutionals instead.  You need to buy a corking device, which can be rather costly, but its something you’ll use over and over again if you wish to also make many of the newer drinks, including Grobb Liquidised Meat.  But the nice thing about the constitutionals is that you aren’t dependent upon anyone else for your combines.  <br />
<br />
The only technical problem I noticed with your guide is some lines of text are cut off due to the width of the columns.  Line 18 is a good example: “Exception to rule 2 ingredients elven wine and dwarven ale cannot be” is all I read without selecting the field.<br />
<br />
Thanks for putting these guides together. I realize they take a lot of work and everyone trying to advance in a trade skill can use all the help they can get.  At least I know I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ever</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to help you out with the htmlizing or anything you'd like.  I'll do it as you request and such, but it'd take some time.  I'm a fan of this site, so I'd be willing to help if you need it sometime also Denmom.  Send me an email as I might not check this too often, Foladar@aol.com or just IM Me there at Foladar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">byelka</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No Prob html them and post them anywhere.<br />
<br />
But before you do send me an e-mail at baile934@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
As I have been adding to them and refining them as I find mistakes  :D</div></div><hr />
