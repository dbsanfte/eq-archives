<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinner Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While surfing for some information, I idly clicked on one of &quot;those&quot; sites that offer to tell me all the secrets of EQ. As I scrolled to the bottom of their page I noticed a copyright notice claiming vigorous protection of said copyright. <br />
<br />
That is totally laughable. They have no authorization from Sony to hold such a copyright. They even admit that their guide is unauthorized. So I should have any respect for a copyright on material that violates someone else's copyright? And drug dealers should prosecute people who steal their drugs.<br />
<br />
They also go on further to state that rewording their guide to reveal their &quot;secrets&quot; will also be construed as a copyright infringement. That would be difficult to pursue as a copyright violation. EQ is a game system. Systems are patented, not copyrighted. Copyrights are for the words contained within a written work. I believe that copyright infringements are also generally only prosecuted in cases where the written work of another is being sold for profit. If this were not true, my students would be in a great deal of legal trouble.  ;) <br />
<br />
For that matter, anyone could use the &quot;fair use&quot; clause to publish part of their &quot;copyrighted&quot; material in a critique of said material, verbatum. Or use it in an investigative write-up about EQ rip-off websites.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about.</div></div><hr />

Let the writers rot.  Anyone ignorant enough to buy them deserves what they get.<br />
<br />
Almost any legitimate way to make money or levels in the game are quickly discussed on messageboards and websites.  Anything not legitimate is more likely to get you banned and the idea is probably on the nerfing block by the time it hits a guide.</div></div><hr />

Thank you cattywumpus, I would have never though of that. Now I can satiate my own curiosity and not get angry at myself for spending money on what I KNOW is going to be pure dribble. :twisted:</div></div><hr />
