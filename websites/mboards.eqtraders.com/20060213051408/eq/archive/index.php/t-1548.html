<br />
Ceggon - You were a good one and I'll miss you. ;) May your furry feet never get dirty.<br />
<br />
Oldive - Can't think how many times I had to say thank you to you. :) May your beard never be cut off.<br />
<br />
Balkin - You helped my friend which in turn helped me. You were a good person to talk to as well. :) May your beer drinking never be disrupted by needing a rez.<br />
<br />
Bye Norrath, we had some good times<br />
<br />
(sorry if I missed anyone that I didn't talk to in game)</div></div><hr />
