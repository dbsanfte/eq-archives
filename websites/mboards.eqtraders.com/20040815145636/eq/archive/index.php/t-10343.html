<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've found Haze Panther Eyes, Block of Living Granite, Holgresh Fur, and Holgresh Wings in the bazaar, but I have yet to find Sifaye Dust, Faun Hoof, or Glob of Tar.<br />
<br />
I know these drop in Wakening Lands, but what kind of faction hit will I take killing them?  Any idea what kind of drop-rate they have?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Still 248 Tinkering and looking for those last two points...<br />
<br />
Also:  Do these sell well?  If so, what price range?  That goes for all the cultural armor (Watchman, Shadowwalker, and Observer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">woushi (sp?)  is on cov faction i beleive.  think there are dragons and giants there.  i could be totally off though.</div></div><hr />

If I were less lazy this morning, I'd check  http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=119<br />
for you.<br />

But I just woke up, so all you get is a link.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It looks like the only faction hit I'd take is Tunarean Court.<br />
<br />
Any reason a 60+ Gnome Enchanter would need this faction?  From what I saw on that site, I won't need it, but I just wonder if that site is fully up-to-date.<br />
<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lacries</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tunare is the faction hit for the mobs in question and as a gnome enchanter you are probably already kos to Tunare anyway....you will essentially be kos in Tunare loving cities and if you were able to enter into the Plane of Growth without immediate agro before, after you would be kos.  The faun's do have a corrupted version who do not give any faction hit and are probably the easiest to hunt.  They have two separate camps ...one over by the Sentients and the other by a giant outpost.<br />
<br />
The price for the armor varies between server.  Good luck and go Gnomes!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tunareancourt is the faction, not tunare.  Mobs on that faction are found nowhere but in Wakening Lands.  The sifaye, the faerie drakes,the butterfly things, the fauns by the tower, and the sylphs inside the tower are all on this faction.<br />
<br />
Feel free to kill them, doesn't mean anything other than that you need to invis if you want to go to PoG before entering the tower.  And with Wakening Lands, it's always a good idea to be invis anyway.<br />
<br />
Or you could just not bother with the sifaye and hats, since they aren't anything special anyway.  For the boots, you can always kill the Faun Outcasts (not corrupted, he's nasty).  They carry no faction hit and always con indifferent.  Sifaye will assist them though (I believe, not 100% sure), as well as buff them and they will assist sifaye.<br />
<br />
For the tar, just need to kill the tar goos in the geonid caves.  No faction hit associated with those, but be aware that when killed, they split into two smaller tars.  Kill those and they can drop the component.  Since you're a fellow chanter, I highly recommend getting Dire Charm.  Makes farming in WL much easier and faster.<br />
<br />
For items you already have:<br />
<br />
Holgresh are on Holgresh faction, but you start out KoS to them anyway.<br />
<br />
Geonid Shamans are on geonid faction.  Not an important one either unless you want to do the phenocryst focus crystal quest.<br />
<br />
Best place I've found to camp is near the giant side outcast faun camp.  3 faun spawns and wandering sifaye, panthers, and holgresh.<br />
<br />
As the armor, nope, it doesn't really sell.  There's a lack of gnomes that wear armor other than cloth.  Most of those are already decked out in Thurg armor, brellium, underfoot, or other stuff.  Shadowwalker in particular is hopeless, since, like all cultural chain, the stats suck compared to easily available items.  The recent increases in Ornate drops have further hurt the situation, as the gloves make it easy for warriors and rogues to get 30% spell haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great, thanks for that information Axterix!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lacries</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So in other words...my Tunare loving druid can kill anything in WL and not worry about faction hits with Tunare himself? ...WOOT!!!! That makes life way easier!!! Thanks for correcting me :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hopefully because of the loot listed;)  Encouragement to kill it!<br />
<br />
But barring that, maybe to mislead Lacries into thinking Tunare is a female?  Because it isn't.  The It of All.  Or would that be Itter of All?  What do you call a mother/father that has no gender?  Parent of All?  Cartman's dad?<br />
<br />
Do the gnomish thing, kill it, dissect it to see how it can be a so called mother of all, and then, more importantly, how parts of it can be used to tinker.<br />

Rar!  Gnomercy.</div></div><hr />
