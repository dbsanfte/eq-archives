<br />
Recently, some of you may know - the Brell Serilis Community switched from EZ to phpbb also. Now - I can't seem to login over there with the same name I have here. Also - it does not seem to want to grant me access via a new handle either - as its the same email address. <br />
<br />
What I would like to know is - is there something I can do to keep the same name here and there - and barring that - will I Need to provide a second email address to get them to let me register a different handle.<br />
<br />
Any and all help will be appreciated.<br />

<br />
I did have to sign up for all the boards I've been to separately with PhBB, guess it doesn't have global accounts.<br />
<br />
I'd just put your same e-mail address with the name you want on that board, and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

Well - I just went over and tried again. I swapped a capital T into the - hoping to make it different - and the name and p/w were taken. So - I changed tyhe name enough so that the second time - the only error was email address already being used.....<br />
<br />
Hmmm.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verdandi</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EZ Board message boards are all part of one massive system that is operated by ezboard.com.  The EZ Board company hosts the board and provides the interface so you can set it up and use it.  All login information and authentication stuff is handled through their central database.<br />
<br />
PhpBB is software that you use to configure and operate message boards that you host yourself.  Two different PhpBB message boards hosted by two different people aren't connected to each other any more than any two documents that were both created with Microsoft Word.  Your login information is held only within that single board and is completely unrrelated to your login information on any other message board anywhere.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the only way to have the same username and password on a phpBB board and any other board is to sign up for each with the same username and password.  If it is denying you the one you want on another board, it's only because someone else already took it on that other board.  If it is saying that your email address is already used, then you probably signed up there some time in the past...or someone is using your email.  See if they have some kind of username and password retrieval feature, or contact the admin.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply -0 very clerly written - I understand how the should work now. <br />
<br />
However - It does not help me too muc :( I dont remember signing in already - as its a new board. Also, I would find it difficult to think that someone already took my name - its pretty specific :) hehe<br />
<br />
In addition - I can't contact someone there - as I cant seem to log on.... :) I will try going over there and see if I can msg a moderator directly...<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

I have managed to fix the problem. :) What happend was this:<br />
<br />
Brell board and Brell rants have linked sign-ups. You sighn up for one - and it works for both. I registered for Brell rants back on 12/25.<br />
<br />
However, at the time - their final stage - clicking on a link to finalize the process - did not work. So - I kept the email - but forgot about it.<br />
<br />
In desperation - I created a yahoo email - and tried again. This time it told me that the user handle was taken. Knowing that the possibility of mine being taken by someone else (randomly) was nearly nil - I clicked on the members list - hoping to find an admin that had an email option, since I could not send an instant message - as I could not log in. I however - found MY login. Hmmm. it was dated 12/25 - so I went into email for that date - and viola! found the email that had the link in it to activate the account - and this time - it worked :)<br />
<br />
Problem solved. My dumb, partially. Thanks for the description of how it works - I did learn something there!<br />

&quot;My headache is clearing now - I think its Clobberin' Time now!&quot;</div></div><hr />
