<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">stupid question but if all your trade skills are above 200 except smithing did you get 6 levels of tannan crafting? If not then you cant take smithing over 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zurrvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes , i have 6 poitns in tan .  i maxed out in AA points at 539. <br />
until  Gates of discord came out .  which im not working on.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Velaraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same thing happened to me last night when i was fletching, i wouldnt go over 200. I logged for the night and this morning i hit 201 w/i 10 combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Zurrvan, just a note that your first thread was moved to the Primal Scream Room (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13866). Please do follow Ngreth's (admin) advice in that thread and stay clear of insults.<br />
If you wish to vent your frustration then by all means please use the Primal Scream Room and not the smithing forum, this place is purely for sharing information.<br />
<br />
Also please review the  rules (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=8) governing this community. Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EchtelionFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">another stupid question. You just purchased the sixth level from tanaan, then proceeded to do the combines, or you logged/zoned between the AA purchase and the combines?<br />
<br />
Maybe there's a refresh problem with it, you know. Over 700 combines without a skillup sounds too much, and exactly at 200...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are you 100% positive you have New tanaan6 and not just 5? many AAs stop at 5 and you may have thought it was done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>alchemyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would like to comment on this...  I noticed the other night when I was doing a skill up...  my &quot;skills' function all started saying &quot;testing&quot;  it said this for a good amount of time, in which about 75 trys I had no skill ups...  I put two and two together and stopped trying, logged, came back and all was good again...<br />
<br />
I don't know why or how you convinced yourself to do 762 attempts to skill with no skill ups...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oerin trubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My worst ever without a skillup was about 85.<br />
I can't imagine having enough materials for a run of 762 attempts in a row.<br />
And no petition or bug report?<br />
Wayyy bad timing on the run and SOE having some bugs going on.<br />
On average 1 skill point for every 2o combines. I did 75 failures in a row and then got 3 points in 7 combines.<br />
The random number generator owes you one helluva streak of good luck in the near future.<br />
That run shoulda been good for 38 skill points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My longest streak of no skillups smithing was 347, at 199 skill. There seems to be a hump right around that level.<br />
<br />
However, there was a guy on the old message boards who had a run of over 1000 combines with no skillup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caprich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I spent about 15k on metal alone between skillups in the 190 and 191. I also had a pretty big spike between 200 and 201. <br />
<br />
If your not getting skillups within 20 to 40 combines its best to give up and try another day, or at least re-log.  Seems to help with luck in any case.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Annalina Romanov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">*shrug* . . . the best thing to do is to not expect a skill-up, really. I've found that you can avoid expecting them by doing a related quest (Shadowscrem Boots in Shar Vahl) or to be making things for a friend (Heraldic Armor; friend brings the Blue Diamonds and Essence of Sunlight). I've gotten skill-ups in both cases, and when I least expected it.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, vary the routine a bit. Go make use of the other 7 character slots for something other than tradeskill mules . . . you're paying for them, and ya might as well make use of them, right? Hell, a Magician's nice and all in my case, but even I get sick of pin'n'nuke after a while. If your guild gives you hell about it, remember: they're not paying for your account, and your time is YOURS, not theirs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yah, I play 3 major characters...<br />
<br />
ShadowKnight (my favorite) for when I just want to feel tough and powerful...<br />
<br />
Enchanter(second favorite) for when I want to feel weak and vulnerable, hehe, (but still vital to the groups survival)<br />
<br />
Ranger, for when I feel like shooting things... I kite like a nerfed druid, who's dots only last as long as my quiver is full...<br />
<br />
Best thing to do when frustrated w/ one character... give up and try another for a while... it only makes coming back that more interesting!</div></div><hr />
