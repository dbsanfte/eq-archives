<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if this has happened on other servers, but it looks like on Lanys, the muddites of the Gorge are bugged.<br />
<br />
I took my little 46 ranger mule out to go hunt heavy clay for me, and although I was the only one in the Gorge for quite some time, I could only find one or two muddites up and only here and there.<br />
<br />
So, I put on my radar hat and checked out track.  Well.  In addition to the 5 or 6 on the other side of the zone, there were EIGHTEEN somewhere on the path between the zone in from EK and the entrance to Runnyeye.<br />
<br />
I checked the run that track showed as being hugely overpopulated and there was not a single muddite to be found there.<br />
<br />
So... it looks like there are 18 of the 24 or so muddites that spawn there that are either on top of or behind the walls.<br />
<br />
I suspect the problem goes back to pathing changes made in a lot of zones a few patches ago.  I noticed that right after that, the muddites were pathing really high on the walls, although not right up them.<br />
<br />
I've bug reported the hell out of this, but so far it hasn't made a difference.<br />
<br />
If you happen to be in a position to check this out on your server, you might throw in a bug report as well.  They might pay attention if more than one person says something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL, well since I passed 236 in pottery last night, I can talk about my &quot;secret&quot; =)<br />
<br />
There are 3 spots in the zone where mobs get stuck in the wall.  Two are up on the wall, on each side of the canyon leading to the three eyes.  One is east of there, along the main canyon from EK to RE, on the north wall.  All three spots are as high on the wall as you can walk, right where it becomes vertical.<br />
<br />
If you go to the spots, you can hear the mobs &quot;walking&quot; but you probably can't see them.  In one spot, they are sometimes visible.<br />
<br />
I used PBAoE spells to kill them, since it was quick and fast, and didn't require targetting mobs I couldn't see.  However, if you don't have a way to PBAoE, just go to the spots you hear the mobs &quot;walking&quot; and sit down.  They will attack you, and appear for targetting =)  They may not become visible, but will attack you, so if you still can't see them, just move away from the wall, they will follow and become targettable.<br />
<br />
I actually bound at one of the spots last month when I started working on GMing pottery.  At the beginning and end of each session, I'd clear all three spots.  This cleared about 20-25 mobs per day, netting 5-10 heavy clays each day.<br />
<br />
Once you clear these spots, the mobs spawn in normal spots, and if killed relatively quickly, you can get to them before they get stuck.  That's if you want to stay there and keep farming them.<br />
<br />
And, yes, I used track to find the spots.  If you track the oldest mobs, and walk slowly once you get close, you will be led right to the spots.<br />
<br />
Tat<br />
<br />
Edit - Just logged in real quick, while I was still bound there.  Spots are at 186, -888, 67 (West side of canyon to 3 eyes), 262, -895, 86 (East side of canyon to 3 eyes, may have gotten this one wrong, it might be 180, -942, 69), and 213, -1295, 66 (north wall of main canyon from EK to RE, just past the &quot;3 eye&quot; canyon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good info, thanks.  I agree on the positions.. I track them to there too.  Didn't think to sit down tho :)<br />
<br />
I petitioned this morning, and a guide confirmed that the mobs were indeed stuck behind the walls.  She killed them all and put in a bug report as well, although she did say that her killing them would not resolve the problem.  I bet her bug report gets noticed no more than mine heh.<br />
<br />
I actually do spend an hour or so in zone in the mornings hunting before I go to work.  It's kind of zen, and my ranger's conjuration skill is going up ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried the sit trick (46 rangers are notoriously low on aoe spells heh) and it worked!  Thanks very much :)<br />
<br />
The funny part was that all of the minors got stuck in one spot and all of the elders got stuck in another.<br />
<br />
It was kind of like playing a slot machine.  I had 8 of them on me before I could blink heh.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, i had noticed that about how they tend to group together when they get stuck.<br />
<br />
I'm glad it helped =)  Actually, I can't take that much credit for the &quot;sit to agro&quot; trick, I came upon it by accident.<br />
<br />
I bound right at one of those spots, and later died in the Hole.  I popped at my bind point, and sat down to re-mem my spells.   Got immediately jumped by 6 mobs, naked, and with nothing memmed =)<br />
<br />
Thank God for run3!!  ran ahead memmed ensnare, grouped em up, then ran ahead and memmed engorging roots.  Even with my maxxed hand-to-hand skill, Druid bare handed melee toe-to-toe with 6 green mobs would still get me killed within a minute or two, LOL.  Got two heavy clays out of it, though!<br />
<br />
After subsequent deaths, I would hit hide first, and check the con against other mobs wandering along the gorge floor. to make sure it worked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pootle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so when you PBAOE these guys do their corpses appear?<br />
<br />
So you can loot em.  Or do you have to type /loot a muddite minor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can usually loot by clicking on the wall next to me.  If I stand sideways and look down, I can usually see part of their names sticking out of the wall.<br />
<br />
If you PBAoE, look in your chat window to see how many were killed.  That helps assure you don't miss looting any.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Herril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Great info,<br />
<br />
I had found one of the &quot;stuck&quot; points by tracking, &amp; never thought about sitting down to pull them.<br />
<br />
As for looting, i generally pull with  &quot;Tremors&quot; PBAoE to pull them out of the wall, cause looting in the wall can be a royal pain.<br />
<br />
then snare &amp; nuke them with &quot;Earthquake&quot; PBAoE once they all get close</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NightGod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just get a Necromantic Tracking Device to target the corpses and then type /loot :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Herril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">COOL, now where would I find one of these Necromantic Tracking Devices  ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>data9724</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe, gotta love the good old VI pathing bug, lots of zones where that happens.<br />
In PoStorms when hunting Daikus, we noticed around 6 rock storms trapped in a stone, our necro tried to get them out, died in around 0.0 sec, but he DID manage to get a few of them out when they attacked him.<br />
<br />
And in WW i had the only person to be there after a patch, hunted velioum hounds for 1 hour, then there were only some up that was stuck under the world, right outside the exit from the SG tunnel. Petitioned, and a guide showed up, and there was the following stuck down there:<br />
3 velium hounds<br />
1 mammoth<br />
2 rhinos<br />
1 ice burrower<br />
And 1 named dragon (cant remember which, one that roam the nearby area. <br />
<br />
All those had managed to get stuck in less than 1 hour after server up, and i was the only one in zone (cant say that noone was there a sec and zoned back to SG, but did /who every few min to check on competition for the hounds).</div></div><hr />

COOL, now where would I find one of these Necromantic Tracking Devices  ?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Necrotic Divining Device (http://www.eqtraders.com/search/reverse_recipe_search.php?item=6687&amp;menustr=010000000000) <br />
<br />
Made by tinkerers, though I don't know that the track corpse feature would work on NPC corpses though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Freekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can type /target a_mud  and that should put the mob corpse in your target window.  Then type /loot and you should get the loot window for the mob.  I do this all the time when a mob falls into a tree or anyother type of scenery where I can't target him directly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Herril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ah, nice<br />
<br />
thanks for the info Freekin<br />
<br />
i made sure to make a hardcopy <br />
<br />
&amp; save to my EQ tips file</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Silound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Alternative is level 4 bard song will point you at and target the nearest corpse if you have nothign targeted, thus making it easy to /loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Atlasius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">reminds me of a while back when i started tailoring.<br />
<br />
you know the little shrooms are in packs of like 5 well everytime i killed one like 3 spiders would pop out and start running.<br />
<br />
track clearly showed that the spiders where neer the shrooms and you could hear them walking.<br />
<br />
after like 1 month and 5 bug reports the problem finally got fixed:D</div></div><hr />
