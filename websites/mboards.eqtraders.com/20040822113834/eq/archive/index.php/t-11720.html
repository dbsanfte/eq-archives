<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...need an update?<br />
<br />
As according to the content of the link ( http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9197 ) :<br />
<br />
&quot;We're NOT yet considering missing quest recipes and incomplete price information as bugs, nor are missing *mob* drop sources. &quot;<br />
<br />
But seems to be it has been done and accepted in this thread :<br />
<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8712<br />
<br />
and here :<br />
<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11661<br />
<br />
But there is still the recommandations in the drop source page as mentionned here to post on the Mob Drop thread in the General Tradeskill section, for exemple :<br />
<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/sources/source_zone_page.php?article=g89&amp;menustr=110000000000&amp;sz=1101<br />
<br />
If the mob drop update post is accepted, I will stop to post on the Mob Drop thread in the General Tradeskill section and post in the Database Update thread.<br />
<br />
Not being picky, but as I saw that the data that I sent were not updated for quite some time, I was wondering if it was still usefull to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Given that intial post was made July 22, 2003... it is a bit dated. The key point was we were getting the Database up initially and we wanted to limit the flood of information we could expect.<br />
<br />
Then LDoN Came out and the post was still relavant because of that new flood.<br />
<br />
I have just this past week been working to start catching up on the sources in the 2nd thread you mention. But sources is a bit tricky, so it might take me till the end of next week (11/7) before I finish with it.<br />
<br />
About the only thing I would say we are ready to amend about Niami's thread is the sources hold. The Quest information is still iffy, and new features is behind that in priority.<br />
<br />
We do have some features in mind, based upon our own use, and some feedback from folks so far. So don't give up hope... but please do not start flooding us with requests yet. Think about them... yes... but think them through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was not my intention to post a request, but to clarify some obscure points about the database update. <br />
I know that the mob drop update is not a primordial point that the eqtraders team is focused on at the moment, and I just wanted to know if I would have to wait for a bit and gather my drop info, then, when the db would be more efficient and optimized, post on the appropriate section to update it.<br />
I know you are all working hard, and I don't want to give you more useless work, but I just wanted to make it clear, as my previous post was not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doh. Of course I read this thread after I make a huge Research Pricing Data dump into Databases forum....<br />
<br />
When Verdandi (et al) closed the Pricing Data forum, it was noted that anything that would have been posted there should be posted in the Databases forum in the future...  did I do something in error (again)?<br />
<br />
But yes, four months in a relatively rapidly changing environment can tend to make guildlines outdated... has something substantive changed?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sanna,<br />
<br />
No you haven't done anything wrong.<br />
<br />
And neither have you Dahna.<br />
<br />
It is always good to get the information posted on the forum. The time required to get it loaded, is just a bit longer.</div></div><hr />
