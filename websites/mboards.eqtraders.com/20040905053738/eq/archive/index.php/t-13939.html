Ok, when I turned in my acrylia studded mask to the Tribute master and was awarded 540 points each, I thought WOW that's awfully high.  But after the nerf, they are only worth 7 points?<br />
<br />
I was hoping that since skill ups don't normally sell very well, I could at least get some decent points for my trouble.  I was hoping for maybe at least 25 points per mask.  But 7?<br />
<br />
Do they want to discourage people from tradeskilling?  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the tradskilling portion of the game.  But I can't even get out of the hole, let alone break even.<br />
<br />
The new tradeskill UI is great, but sometimes I can't even give away my skillup items.  I want to GM tailoring first and eventually get to 1750.<br />
<br />
So now, what do I do with my skillups?  <br />
:boggled:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tribute guys are SUPPOSED to give 1 point per plat a vendor would normally give. There were many errors. With 500 and 1k points for cheap mass produced items people would never run out. Imagive getting 500 points for every trade skill combine while skilling up. You'd be full of buffs for life!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ldymech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do understand the whys, of it.  I just frustrates me no no end to have all this useless fodder in the bank.  The RNG hates me.  I was only hoping to be able to get a little more out of my product than I am currently.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills are expensive if you don't have a character that is high enough to actually farm the stuff you need.  Since my main is a 42 cleric, that means I have to wait until the mobs are green before I can farm them.<br />
<br />
I'm not attacking Sony, really, just venting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">isn't 7pp still more than you can sell them for?  just use them to buff your own tributes for a while then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always thought the masks were worth about 5p cause everyone and their brother skills up on em and you can find stacks and stacks and stacks on vendors for like 6gold all the time.<br />
<br />
They are very generous at 7 tribute each.<br />
<br />
Remember, 1 tribute = 1p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceggon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was puzzled from the start that the tribute value of an item would be anything other than what a vendor would pay for it. It seems that they already had a system in place (vendors) that valued items (at least according to their opinions).<br />
<br />
I'm going to enjoy my 300k points over the next week and not worry about it too much. We'll see what happens after the nerf bat (next week's BIG one I mean) swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I made a few arctic wyvern masks to finish off tailroign today and I was happy with the 18 or so point sI got each thats more than I got before GoD came out. I used to destroy them since resale was pretty much zilch. Be happy its SOMETHING as before you got NADA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aanalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh..  back to root problems, why do vendor pay dirt for tradeskilled item.. <br />
<br />
On wich economy (dream world) does artisan sell product they make UNDER the cost of components ?!<br />
<br />
Too easy to make money you say ?.. have you tradeskilled lately ?<br />
<br />
What the difference between me making 1pp profits from a 100pp components it item ? . .(and maybe loose 100pp on a failure)  and a farming HG in RM for 1k a night .. (while i loose multiple K tradeskilling!)<br />
<br />
ya.. k..  let go mindlessly xp in plane, and make 100k on a lucky ornate mold drop ;p<br />
<br />
rinse and repeat..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">because they haven't found people macroing and killing planar mobs for cash drops.  they have to be at the comp to farm cash drops.  that's the only difference i have seen.  plus a vendor item plat making combine is too easy.  you can skill level 1's to anyone tradeskill gm.  level 1's cannot farm the planes therefore they have to balance tradeskills so that level 1's are overpowered.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, it all goes back to the age old &quot;Why do vendors pay jack for tradeskill items?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, since it's not real Plat, you'd think that they'd up the prices for favor.<br />
<br />
But nope.  :-(<br />
<br />
<br />
-Lilosh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sulkano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm confused how the Tribute system in any way affects Tradeskills, lol...the two arent even in the same room let alone the same page</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sulkano, the folks are upset that the items that they make for skill ups are unsellable to players, and now the tribute npc doesn't really want them either. Don't worry about it. All us tradeskillers wig out one day or another. It helps to just smile and go &quot;yup&quot; and not take it personally. Even when it is the RNG which is out to get you. Just lean out the window and listen carefully. That noise is me, or some other tradeskiller, wigging.<br />
<br />
The original points earned were way out of wack. Like animated bait which costs 3 coppers to make yielding something like 1100 tribute points. Fine steel, which at least one could use to make HQ ore, going for 500-1000 points.<br />
<br />
At least some of the droppable PoP and LDoN items that flooded the market had some value for a while. Like the ranger only 1hs from mistmoore theme. Or the paladin 1hb from CoDecay.<br />
<br />
And yes, I would like fries with my wig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dyllwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What upsets me the most about the situation is the people who did not know.<br />
<br />
When I first visited the Tribute Master in RV I didn't know anything about them. I went through all the items in my inventory and saw what was worth what. I noticed alot of tradeskill items were worth alot, but I thought maybe that was Sony's way of removing them from the economy and making them more valuable. The one that caught my eye the most was the Tae Ew Shield. It caught my eye because I'm working two characters up through smithing, my Ogre Rip was sitting at 243 and had 33 blood in the bank. I decided that if Sony wanted to give me 22k Favor for each shield then I would accept. I did a skill run with the 33 blood, made 3 points to 246 and turned in 29 shields over 2 characters.<br />
<br />
Then I find out that everything is out of whack. Simple little items are giving way too much favor. Of course they pull the masters, and I completely understand that. I even understand and support the changes they made, even if I wish they had given us a little more value for the &quot;typical&quot; skill up items that each class grinds out to create more of a market.<br />
<br />
What I find most distressing however is that after next week I will lose the points that I gained by turning in the shields, shields I would not have turned in at the present value (or at least I would have thought more about it and maybe tried to find good homes for them with guild mates). I can understand the 200k cap, but maybe what they should do now is simply cap everyone at 200k after next week and leave it at that. I would much rather be stuck at 200k from 400k then drop to 90k. Either that or let me get my shields back and drop me to zero and then I can decide whether to turn them back in. When they make changes to the AA system they usually refund AA's.<br />
<br />
I know they probably don't have records of each transaction with the Tribute Masters, so I guess my suggestion is probably not doable, but it's what I would want in a perfect world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">IMO tradeskill stuff should be worth above average to the Tribute Master.  This will make tradeskill items more in demand to other players and get them sold and out of the game faster.  It would be smart to make the items which are entering the game the fastest the ones that are worth the most so you don't have a huge surplus of these particular items.</div></div><hr />
