<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sahsara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i will be attempting my 4th try at this tonight.<br />
<br />
All tradeskills are at least 160, so the sub combines are not a big deal ('cept the vial of mana .. have a chanter friend for that)<br />
<br />
What I wanted to know is... does anyone have any suggestions as far as what stats to get buff'd? on all but the first attmept I had a shammy and chanter &quot;buff me with all ya got&quot; in hope's it would help. Now I did not get &quot;top=of-the-line&quot; buff's do to their lvl's. This time I will if anyone thinks anything might help. My bank is very upset at me over this! hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks to all those buying my drinks on the nameless to support the kiln and brew barrel in PoK.. both are far richer for my attempts....<br />
<br />
2 x's fail in brew barrel<br />
1 x fail on the seal in the kiln.. what a crock that was!!! <br />
<br />
cheers to everyone and happy drinking !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Falmorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no idea if this was even a factor or not, however:<br />
<br />
I believe at the time that I made my corker, I had my wis as high as it would go naturally (somewhere around 238), a 'chanter in my guild had cast VoQ (Voice of Quellious, upgrade to KEI I think) on me, and my brewing was maxed at 250.  Only level 55 at the time, however, so of course my wis hit the 255 cap.<br />
<br />
With the exception of the vial of viscous mana (same 'chanter to the rescue there), I did the artisan's seal all on my own.  Fewer people to blame for a failure, and more reason to cheer on a success.  :D  I used the brew barrel in PoK, inside the building southeast of the bank - not a good place or time, but I was so anxious that I couldn't wait long enough to get to SH.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, I don't think that any of the other buffs will really matter.  If you can find one, get a SHM or BST with Infusion of Spirit; it's a general physical stat booster, and while brewing doesn't really use anything other than wis or int, it might still make you feel better.<br />
<br />
Just a couple of thoughts,<br />
Fal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">success on an item is solely dependent on your skill and your luck.  have you sacrificed a gnome lately?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I failed my first one.<br />
Gonna try in the next couple days again but with my luck who knows I will probably break the record for failed attempts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sahsara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The trick is to <br />
1. help the stranger in GD shouting for  someone to charm a MoB to aid in a quest<br />
2. tell your guild (in all caps) to stop what they are doing and pray for you before you hit the combine button.<br />
<br />
<br />
WUWUW !!!! Now to get something nifty to Augment it with !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Afferon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It took three tries for mine. My friend did his on first Try. I am Half elf he is Leezard so don't think buffs mean a whole lot but you never know. I had also used the 5% geerloc tool and was maxed at 250. You might try and I know it sounds nuts but try getting scarecrow Illusion. This Illusion seems to help combines for some reason. My guild been playing with this and yes it does seem to work /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As stated, officially the only thing that will affect the success of a combine is your skill in that trade skill.  And using a geerloc will help to increase your skill so it’s worth using.  The rest is irrelevant.  <br />
<br />
That having been said, it can’t hurt to get buffs or illusions or to hop up and down on one foot while patting your tummy.  A gnome friend of mine will only do spell combines in her home city because she’s never failed there.  Do whatever makes you feel better and perhaps the goddess of chance will smile upon you.<br />
<br />
I’ve been very lucky.  I was successful with my first trophy on my first attempt.  I just GMed brewing on a second character and he also succeeded at making his trophy on his first attempt.  Perhaps I should stop while I’m ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>catterly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My first try I was buffed to the gills and had a kei and i looked at the combine button for 5 min before pushing it....failed.<br />
<br />
2cnd try I had no buffs and loaded up barrel and hit combine in like 3 secs and made it :) <br />
<br />
Like was stated its all skill and luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it can’t hurt to get buffs or illusions or to hop up and down on one foot while patting your tummy. <br />
<br />
Lol, you could make an emote, put it on a social and spam it while you do your combines. Who knows, maybe it will help?<br />
This was already stated, but I'm not sure it was done emphatically enough-USE a geerlok or any other +skill device you have for that particular tradeskill. If your brewing is at 250, your skill will be effectively increased to 252, this is the highest level you will ever be able to do combines at in this game.</div></div><hr />
