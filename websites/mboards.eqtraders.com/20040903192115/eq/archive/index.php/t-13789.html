<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jylarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now don't get me wrong, I am totally loving this new tradeskill system.  The fact that I can whip up some MTPs without having to open every friggin bag in my inventory and doing 50 clicks per attempt is awesome...<br />
<br />
But is this too easy?  First of all after shopping for ingredients it is going to take 1/4 of the time to make these suckers.  I wouldn't be totally suprised if this started driving down costs of MTPs and Halas pies and what not on all the servers...<br />
<br />
I guess I am also kinda ticked at the fact of how easy it just became for people to skill up in tradeskills now.  I busted my butt for my 230 and rising baking skill... and now a friend started today and dinged 150 in under an hour.  I suppose I shouldn't complain too much as I am abusing the system the exact same way (0 to 160 pottery in an hour in thurg) but it kinda takes some of the prestige out of GMing something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought I would be, but I'm not. I tried making both items last night using the new UI and ya know what? I'm a bit faster on my own than I am with the new UI. The pause clicking the combine button and the messing around with the recipes and stuff only delayed me. I can actually do it faster. I just don't get why all of the sudden there were 600 patty melts per person. The new UI is *not* that fast in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure most people will not recognize this for the joking attitude I'm sure you intended it to be. For the record, I didn't  say I didn't *like* the new interface, just that I thought I was faster. :) <br />
<br />
I sure like it for combines for the final stage of halas 10s or mtps, that's for certain. Even though I think I'm faster, I suspect that for the final combines at least, I'm hideously impatient waiting for that darned combine button to refresh. My personal guess is that I'm faster on the subcombines and about equal to the final combines.<br />
<br />
I've seen some differences in the selling of MTPs and Halas10s on Stromm already. But I'm going to wait it out and see what happens over time. Farming the ingredients will still be the stumbling block for most people, not the actual combinations, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Waahhhhhhhh.  Everybody is going to cry about something regarding the new UI.  Give it a break.  It is, from what I have read, a very nice addition to the game.  I GMed on picnics the old way.  It took a long time to do.  It was time intensive, and could turn a hefty profit.  Now, it is not so time intensive, and yes, more people will be doing TS as a result.  Will they stick with it?  Most people only do because they like doing them.  I think that the new UI is a godsend, as I enjoy doing TS, but did not want to spend my entire night doing just one thing.  Now, I can do some TSing, plus trying to get some EXPing in.<br />
<br />
I can do a batch of 200 combines of picnics for about 100pp.  I should get about 400 or so picnics from that run.  I can sell them for 10pp a pop and try to make 3900pp.  I can sell them for 5pp and make 1900pp.  I can sell them for 2pp and make 700pp.  Heck, I could even sell them for 5 gold and make 100pp.  <br />
<br />
The point is, it is a very over inflated price that is being charged on them.  Just about everything for sale in the bazaar is that way.  It always has been, it always will be.  So what if they start selling for 5pp each.  As long as they are selling, you are going to make a profit with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">was to poke fun but also <br />
I busted my butt for my 230 and rising baking skill... and now a friend started today and dinged 150 in under an hour.  <br />
kind of upset me.  i gmed the old way.  i can see not being happy some random person you don't know has it easier than you.  <br />
my friend was skilling up baking and fletching last night.  i grats him and made sure he was using the easiest skillup path.  i don't wish 8 hour picnic grinding days on any freind with the old ui.  this would make it much cheaper and quicker.  <br />
<br />
rewde how do you make them for 100pp?  euca leave are 80pp store bought.  fennel is another 40pp.  mandrake is 80pp if i can't find it on vendors pre-woven.  thats 200pp minimum.  i agree that half the time on picncis will make me start charging half the price unless it doesn't fall.  i doubt it will stay 10pp though.  i make enough to try to feed my entire guild a stack each time i make them and try to make them often enough to keep everyone (but me ironically) eating picnics.  they are cheap.  this will make them easier.  that can only be a good thing when feeding my guild.<br />
<br />
edit i find it faster for most things.  the bit of server lag in sticking items in the continers keeps me slower or the same as the ui.<br />
<br />
why my spoon is so special to me. (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13718)  its this stuff that make me tradeskill.  not the freebies but to avoid loot ninjas and and trolls.  (the bad ones.  the good ones tradeskill. :D )<br />
<br />
ok further explanation.  if he was upset his friend skilled up to 150 with the new ui while he went to 230 the old way i should be a lot more upset because i am 250 the old way.  really though.  i would grats his friend.  i don't like the eletist attitude and was trying to show how rediculous it looked.  it worked.  i did look stupid.  :eek: didn't mean to confuse people though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, ok, it is just sleightly more than 100pp, probably around 130ish.  I refuse to buy the mandrake and weave it myself.  For this reason alone, I have almost 4 bags full of woven madrake roots that I bought for very little cost.  I also buy the jum jum spiced beer pre made, as it is a skill up route a lot of people seem to use.  I also don't need to buy my veggies, or fruit.<br />
<br />
I have been saving the brownie parts that I have looted also, so not the horrific cost to buy them in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
One time, though, I was extremely lucky and found a bag worth of the mints on a vendor, that made for one healthy profit on those picnics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is the Combine refresh time variable, perhaps by ingredient amount or trivial level?  I've had to wait no more than a second for my Combine button to refresh in the new UI for everything from brewing to baking to pottery, and it was usually ready to go a fraction of a second after I clicked Auto-Inventory.  I haven't done Halas pies, but from what I've seen you're on crack if you think you're faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect that system and connection load variables will place a noticeable difference on people's results with *SUBCOMBINES*. But I can guarantee you I'm faster on the *SUBCOMBINES*. The actual pie combine I believe I'm equal to the new UI. Think about these things...<br />
<br />
Many things affect the time it takes to combine items or even simply play the game. Things like connection time (service provider upspeed and downspeed), system health (old and outdated? newest of everything?), and system strength (raring to go hot rod or basic Dell box? Kludged together bits from your husband's work as an IT God?). <br />
<br />
In fact even *where* you do your combines will have an impact on how fast or slow any combine is made, new UI or not. For example, try doing combines near the Nexus bank in the Bazaar while looking at the toons in Trader mode as a Bard is casting an AoE spell. Now go do the same combine in Halas sitting on the dock. <br />
<br />
Whether or not I'm on crack is immaterial given this simple fact: Your Mileage May Vary.</div></div><hr />

THANK SOLUSEK FOR THE NEW UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baldaek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">2 EZ is right!<br />
<br />
I was half expecting to have a long night of MTP/HMP/KC combines when I didn't see the recipes in my oven (or barrel) window, but OMG!  the new UI has AI!!!!!<br />
<br />
It learns!  It learns!<br />
<br />
Oh happy day!  If only this came with the original packaging I wouldn't have Carpal Tunnel today  /weep</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">but you aren't getting worse.  :D  the tahnks thread is in general hehe.  loving it too though.  need to see what my next picnic run looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Angelsyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Since this hasn't gotten out of hand, I'll let it stay open...<br />
<br />
Personally, the thing I like about the new UI is &quot;combining on the run&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can make Silk Threads, Patty Melts or whatever in my collapsible (insert container here) while I'm riding my horse from bank to vendor, or Book to Wayfarer camp.<br />
<br />
Very convenient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here's the funny thing though - I'd planned my picnics and pies to sell out around the time GoD came out. Now on my server I check in bazaar and there's not nearly as many up for sale as there used to be. In fact there's less now than before the expansion. Noticably less.<br />
<br />
Same way I planned my CE sales to run out around GoD, they didn't of course but after it came out I sold out everything I had left fast and got much more interest in more CEs than before it. Combine that with my velium temper becoming unprofitable overnight (no big though, I'll just save it for personal use) and I can't stop laughing at this insane economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I finally had the chance to try the new UI on a toon *other* than my GM baker bazaar mule girl. I've been slowly playing this adorable little halfling druid of no skills and had an excess of tradeskill supplies that I needed to sell or otherwise get rid of. On a whim I took her back in to Rivervale to try some tailoring and baking.<br />
<br />
I discovered that the UI *IS* significantly faster if you're not in the middle of a big lagfest zone. My baking toon has never done her combines anywhere other than in the Bazaar. Ever. It appears that I've gotten quite good at dealing with the lag that happens there when I go through large runs of things like HMPs and MTPs. But when my little druid baby went through combines that were the equivalent of pies and picnics there was a noticeable difference in the speed of the combines. Subcombines are still faster in my opinion done the &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. But the bigger combines in a non-lagged zone (ie, not the Bazaar) were definitely quicker with the new UI.<br />
<br />
So, too easy? Perhaps if you're not in a lagged zone and I suspect that every new yahoo trying out these pies and picnics doesn't combine them in the Bazaar like I do. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">too easy? that's a judgement call.<br />
<br />
it's too easy to med now days - you don't have to look at a book (I think most would agree that this is a good easy)<br />
<br />
it's too easy not to get lost - sense heading at 200 (many would probably agree that this was a not so good easy)<br />
<br />
Things change.  Change can be good or it can be bad or it can be neutral.  For me it's nice that I don't have to organize 2 toolboxes perfectly and calculate exactly how many attempts I can try before I run out of room.  For me it's nice that I can click the button while running on my drogmar (someone said you could always do this &lt;shrug&gt;).<br />
<br />
For me, it's not so nice that MTPs have dropped in price by 50%.  But I can tell you that the buyers of those MTPs are rejoicing since now they can buy 2x as much, and we take half as long to make them.<br />
<br />
I'll still make a profit.  I still have tons to share with friends.  All my toons will be twinked with MTPs.<br />
<br />
The real question here should be, are YOU having fun with the UI?  Does it improve your game experience?  If the answer is yes, then does it matter if something is 'too easy'.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents worth until I can go back baking again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>cannyar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ok... i made a run of picnics last night because i was frustrated with hunting down epic turn in mobs (anyone seen wanlan lately on xev? grrr..)<br />
<br />
took me a little bit to get the hang of the new ui (and to figure out i should add recipies to my favorites list vs. searching for them over and over) but i like it. it's handy for not digging through my bags. the auto-inventory button is nice.<br />
<br />
my only complaints is the window is soo large. and that my bags were in complete disarray after i was done with the run (from using autoinventory over and over). took a few minutes to get all sorted out and then i was happy.<br />
<br />
saved me clicks. a lot of clicks. so i'm happy. cut the run time in half easily once i figured out what was going on. next time will be even quicker.<br />
<br />
actually, when i was done i was like &quot;that's it?&quot; i expected at least 2 hrs of mindless clicking to calm me down. instead i had quick stacks of picnics to give away to guildies.<br />
<br />
yeah it will mean a lot of new insta-gm's. i'm still glad i earned my spoon a few weeks ago the hard way. i feel like i accomplished something then. definately half the achievement it used to be.<br />
<br />
thanks sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm really enjoying the new UI.  I do most of my TS in NFP It's quite and nearly everything I need is there. What I miss I log to my Druid who has good faction in SH and he buys what I am missing. I did a run of Minotaurs last night. I popped into WFP and bought 21 stacks of malt and 7 of yeast. Bought 14 water and bought what was needed off the vendor at the brew barrel. The brew is a 9 item combine. Prior to the new UI I had to spend a lot of time organizing each batch in my bags on each side of the brew barrel. Now I just click combine and auto-inventory untill either the beer or casks turn red... <br />
<br />
Pricing on Drinal for HMP and MTP are also starting to erode. A while back when I started to make HMP's the price was always 5p each and there were only 2-3 of us selling. Now there's 8-10 and a few with huge quantites and now they are at 4p each (a 20% drop).<br />
Same thing now with the MTP's. 8+ sellers and huge qty's. They have dropped 33% from 15 to 10. I also suspect as stock doesn't move price chopping will be happening..<br />

<br />
Now you don't even have to move the mouse! Just keep clicking combine whenever it pops, and this hotbutton every 5 combine. See, now it's even easier than it was :D<br />
<br />
You can do this combine while watching TV, reading a magazine, etc. With right timing, Combine button pops in sync with the autoinv, making a sound. Hear the sound, click a button. 5 combines, click hotkey with other hand.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I have been next to sleeping late nights doing this saving myself from tunnel syndrome that old combines gave.<br />
<br />
Finally.. why rant about the new tradeskill UI?  It's not like it has replaced the old way of doing it, it has merely given you an alternative. Use the one you like the best, or mix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really hope that Balkin is right. The resale market is getting flooded. The other night I spot checked different baking/brewing items. <br />
Heady Kiola - 1800 for sale at less than 4pp. One trader had over 600<br />
GLM - 1600 at less than 4pp and one vendor with 600+<br />
HMP - 1400 at 3p4g as the lowest and 400+ on one vendor<br />
MTP - over 1000 and price was 10pp on most<br />
<br />
For most of these there were over 8-10 vendors. Prior there was maybe 3-5 vendors at any given time. <br />
<br />
I only make MTP now to get to GM in baking. I'll wait for the dust to settle before making the other items.<br />
<br />
On a side note. On my trader I always carry pots, muffin tins, pie tins, dairy spoons, skinning/filleting knives, casseroles, cake rounds etc for resale to new Ts'ers. The last few nights I've had a run on these items..<br />

OMG!!!  The horror!!!<br />
<br />
Not sure the cost on the HK, but in regards to the baking, those prices are not that bad.  You can sell GLM for 3pp and still make a profit, same with HMPs.  For the MTPs, as I have said before, you can sell them for as low as 5g-1pp and still make a profit, granted at those prices, it will only be a few hundred plat, instead of the few thousand being bilked from the customers.<br />
<br />
Remember the old addage, if you can't beat em(lower prices, as shown above), join em(same price and wait, they will eventually sell).<br />
<br />
If you want the instant profit, and the ability to make more and put more up for sale, just lower your prices and get it over with.  If you want the steady, high, profits that you were previously used to, buck up, sitck your products on the market at the same price as everyone else, and wait.  The products will sell, it may take some time, but, they will sell.</div></div><hr />

How much more of a profit do you need?  You do a LDoN adv you are going to get between 20-200pp for about an hour worths of work.  You spend an hour making MTPs, and then sell the 400 you made for 3pp each, and you make 1k of profit.  Heck, you can sell them for 5g each and make a 50pp profit!!!<br />
<br />
I really wish people would stop whining about how much profit they are losing because the new UI has made things more easily done for them, and other people who have done the same thing. <br />
<br />
Give it a rest.  If you don't like how low the prices can go, then do 1 of 2 things: 1) talk to the other sellers and try to get them to raise their prices, or lower yours 2) stop making the items and do something else with your time.  It's plain and simple.<br />
<br />
It's like I said above, if you can't beat them, join them.  If you don't want to join them, don't make yourself frustrated, get out of the competition with them.</div></div><hr />

   I have to agree with Rewde here.  I also think we are seeing a spike not a trend.  Once the &quot;OMG it is so easy to get a GM item with the new interface&quot; people are done flooding the market with their detritus it may end up evening out lower but still close to the old prices.  Most of our customer base are those that are not willing to take the time to make the items in the first place.  If they were not willing to take 4 hrs to make them, I doubt that they will take 2 hrs either (assuming the &quot;half the time&quot; average in the creation process holds true). <br />
<br />
:idea:  My humble suggestion is to make items that are not common in the market place and hawking them.  For example, I make Pickled Wurm (as I am currently on a Wurm killing spree).  Nice item with +1 to all stats, and I sell it for 1-1.5p each.  Cost is a couple gold (or so) to make.  Sells good, you just have to generate some customer interest (/auct) for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Laoghairre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">So who cares if people can make picnics faster now?  I had to make them the old, hard, drawn out way.  But I also sold them for 2kpp each back then.  I'd be happy to sell them for less now if it didn't take as long.  Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>jedok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You make a run of 200 combines, costing about 150pp (if you farm, forage, and buy a few pre-made things like woven mandrake root, beer...),  <br />
<br />
A little off topic, (Personally I love the UI, started baking before UI to 188, now 197 with UI), but I was wondering what items you are able to farm/buy in the MTP combine.  It seems like Im spending 150pp for 50 combines or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If you can find them on your server on merchants, buy already woven mandrake root, jum jum spiced beer.  Farm your own brownie parts, and forage your own veggies and fruit if you can do so.  For a good cost analysis see my post in PSR titled Picnics and Pricing.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your skilling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>casala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think there is a tradeoff with the new UI.  I think the combines / skillup rate has been increased.  I don't have my data with me atm, but here is information I have so far:<br />
<br />
Skillup 198-241 (43 points)<br />
Average combines / skillup:  ~ 50<br />
<br />
305 Int<br />
Raid buffed<br />
<br />
After nearly 2000 combines of MTP (non-consecutive, i.e. I would do runs of 200 combines [yield of 800 mtp at absolute best] then go play, come back and do another run) I am getting the impression that I'm either having an extremely bad run of luck over the course of the past 2 weeks or there has been some change to the skillup rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Nanndas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hit the shaman alchemy vendors for woven mandrake. I check PoK, SH and Halas. I've been able to purchase over 200. I bought 60 in the bazaar off a trader for 2pp each.<br />
<br />
SH and RV for the beer as people use it as a skill up. I bought just under 2000 for 8cp each.<br />
<br />
The Iskar smithing vendors in PoK. I picked up 400 picnic baskets the other night. I also bought 140 MTP's off the vendor of Jumjum stalks in SH. Sometimes you can also find steel boning on vendors.<br />
<br />
People also sell whole cakes in the Bazaar for less than cost, considering it takes brownie parts to make. Lately Brownie parts when you can find them for sale are 50pp+ each in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
My trouble lately is there have been no veggies for sale at any price in the bazaar lately. Combined with my druid foraging just about everything but veggies while tracking brownie scouts in Gfay, I've ran out..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Laoghairre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">IMO the best place to forage veggies is North FreePort, as it is only old world forage table and you won't get any odd stuff (i.e. glow lichen, druid epic pieces).</div></div><hr />

I farm all fruit/vegies/brownie/eggs myself and still spend 225PP for a run of 200. But even so still can make profit at 1PP. 3-5PP gives resonable profit for the time invested.

Look at this thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14312) it gives a complete breakdown, and everything else you need to know about pricing for them thar picnics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>LexBardMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">thoes of us that were maxed before this patch can puff out our chest and call ourself OLD SCHOOL. It is a scar and wear it proudly.<br />
<br />
Oh spare me, you think hours of MINDLESS clicking is something to be proud of?  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I didn't do much tradeskilling before the new UI because I KNEW it was a ridiculously stupid timesink, not because I was lazy or whatever you &quot;old school&quot; tradeskillers like to call it.<br />
<br />
At any rate, this subtle condescension is getting old fast.  Some people are apparently so bitter about doing tradeskills the tedious way that they can't help but drag new tradeskillers down.  My suggesation to them is to grow up and quit whining.  :grumpy:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>solithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Oh look at you with your fancy level 65. Back in my day our level stoped at 60 and we liked it! Oh sure the youngins these days are level 65 inside a week,..why the very thought of power leveling was absurd back in my day. Kids these days have it Easy I tell you! With their Fancy new zones with the Easy XP. The only sanctity and respect we had was our tradeskills. Now that was something we could pour our souls into. But them kids ya see they just couldn't take the time to do it the way God intended, OH no they had to go and try and speed things up. Mess up our time honored tradition of hard work and sweat all because they wanted some new fangled earring thing from some Aid gimily guy. Sheeehhh<br />
<br />
What a laugh.<br />
I mean seriously, Come on. If the notion of &quot;old school&quot; buggs ya best to let it go cause its been around for ages. Eventually the 'new UI' will be old shool and the next UI will do all the subcombines for you and there wont be a delay :)<br />
<br />
These things Still take some work, they still require subcombines and its obvious they bring more tradeskillers to this site then ever before. Sure some will get GM faster now, but that is the way of things, just as I joked about above with levels. I'm both Old School and new UI and I must say, Old school killed my favorite mouse and for that reason alone I like the new UI.<br />
