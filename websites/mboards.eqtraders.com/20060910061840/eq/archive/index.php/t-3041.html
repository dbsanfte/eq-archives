<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need a little bit of info regarding Wyverns in Cobalt Scar if anyone could provide some.  I've not hunted in CS before so I'd like to know how common these mobs are.  I am a Halflling Thief and currently level 59.  Allekhazam's shows the Wyverns between level 38 and 42.  Do they undercon?  Since they only go up to level 42, I am supposing these will be green to me.  Will they be difficult to kill for myself?  Do they assist each other?  How common do the Arctic Wyvern Hides drop?  How busy are the camps usually (meaning how many other characters can I expect to be camping them)?  EQTraders says that Wyverns are on CoV faction but you do not take a faction hit when they are killed unless you kill a named.  How often can I expect a named Wyvern to spawn?<br />
<br />
I suppose I won't be doing Arctic Wyvern Hides in the near future because my skill is still only 194 but I'd like to get a little heads up before I make the move to work on Arctic Wyvern Armor to increase my skill.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />

The adds will depend on your dragon faction status.   At 59 you should have no problems killing these and some should be light blue.  Just avoid the named wyven and drake.  One of each can be up.<br />

<br />
I have been there for like 5 levels now (45-50) and find that the spawns can be hotly contested during peak hour on Xegony.<br />
<br />
The spawn points are static and there are a lot of them. Never counted how many but likely 30+.<br />
<br />
As far as the hide drop rate I would guess 1 in 7 but I have never really kept track. The drop rate seems rather streaky.<br />
<br />
I would expect to see the named Wyvern up every time you go. Too many people hunting there and hardly anyone wants to face her (or her faction hit as the case may be)<br />
<br />
How easy they would be to you I can't say. Being a caster it is hard for me to judge what it would be like for melee...they seem to hit for a max of 100-125ish. One thing to note is the drakes if you get in their range by accident, have a 500 point AoE.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

If so they should be fairly easy for you at 59. They hit pretty fast but no too hard and they don't have many hp for their level. Wyverns and drakes will add, but not at 59 from what I have found. They are on dragon faction, so if you are ok in SS you'll be ok here. Pelts drop very often, maybe 1 in every 5-7 kills. Wyverns are heavily camped because wizards and druids love to quad kite them. Avoid Yvolcarn, the named wyvern, because he summons and cannot be rooted or snared and is generally not worth the trouble. He is up fairly often, but people just avoid pulling him and he stays put. The wyverns are spread out across the upper plateau in CS along the edges and there are 5 up in the tower to SS. You'll learn the spawn areas quickly. Wyverns are pretty much FFA so just take em down as you find them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for the quick responses.  The last part that Naeen posted &quot;they are on the upper plateau&quot; is nice to know ahead of time.  Sounds like they are much like the Rockhoppers in DSP.  Maybe 1 or 2 levels lower though since at 59 I still see some Blue Rockhoppers.  But it also sounds like they can hit a little harder than the Rockhoppers since I've only seen a max 105 damage from the Rockhoppers.<br />
<br />
By Thief, yes I mean Rogue, but I RP that I consider myself a Thief and refer to anyone who uses the name &quot;Rogue&quot; as a Skirt Chaser and are not true Thief's  :P <br />

At 60 I rarely even see a light blue wyvern and never see a dark blue.  They have around 2800 hp's.  As a rogue you may be able to kill them but unless you wear a fungi or have a pocket healer you will have to regen some hp's to fight the next one.  If you kept up your bind wounds you can bind to 70 percent.  I guess it really comes down to how many hp's you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently, without alot of Sta gear, I have 1908 HP unbuffed.  I have done alot of binding in the past and am well into the 200's and can bind to 70%.  With AA's, depending on how long it will be before I decide to head to CS to hunt the Wyverns, I may have 1 or 2 AA points into First Aid.  Which will allow me to bind up to 80 or 90%.  I have my AA set at 20% so it climbs slowly.<br />
<br />
If I get the help from guild Shammys/Druids/Bards who want some nice exp, I should be able to do quite well against the Wyverns.  I'll tackle that when the time comes.  Rockhopper farming is tough without a Healer/Snarer/Fearer so I can expect the same thing against the Wyverns.  Anyone know if Othmir's sell Food/Water/Bandages/Fishingbait?  ;) <br />

There is one named Wyvern who is slighty harder then the rest.  He may still be DB to you at 59.. But there is a fraction hit envolved.  The Wyverns are not especially hard.. suggest duoing maybe otherwise the down time may kill you as they do still hard decently hard.  The Drakes are really annoying and will aggro you while fighting a wyvern reguarldess of your fraction.  So generally you have to zone them.   I would suggest being non kos to CoV more is better should you happen to killed the named wyvern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilnoom</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coming from a rogue to a rogue.... I think you may have problems soloing these. Its been a while since I've fought there, but I remember getting my ass handed to me once or twice.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend getting a Locutlure if you are going to toe-to-toe with them or get a snare-procing weapon and ID them. Snare-proc and ID obviously being the faster of the two. Locustlures are going for under 2k on Bertox now - not sure what they would be on your server.<br />
<br />
With no offence, at under 2k hp unbuffed I think you may struggle. I'm at over 3400 now unbuffed (yup, I'm a hp freak :) ) but I think I was sitting around 2200 when I was level 60 (and yes, my gear has vastly improved over the last few months). AC hasn't changed much - still 1100ish.<br />
<br />
I could barely toe-to-toe with drolvargs in DL when I was 60 (epic mainhand, LSoEE offhand) - sometimes I'd be forced to leggit. If memory serves me correctly, the wyverns hit about the same.<br />
<br />
I would really recommend duoing with a druid or something. Snare, fear poka poka poka and yer home free :) Faster, less riskier too.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to scan the Othmir merchants either for hides :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meirril</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets see if I can be a bit more accurate than the rest. If your KOS with CoV faction I wouldn't recomend hunting the Wyvern at all. One bad quad kite from a wizard or druid would mean looking for a port to CS for a CR. If your Ally with CoV you don't need snare! I highly suggest working up to there as other wyvern and drakes won't assist. There are 26 static spawn points for Wyvern (+/- 2, going from memory), including 5 in the tower that leads to SS that almost nobody pulls (no guts no glory, I pulled them). You'll find that CS is way over camped by druids and wizards. There are several spawns that don't get pulled for one reason or another. As a rogue you'll find these and take advantage of them. Don't kill the named wyvern or drake, they give -CoV faction hits, the rest don't affect faction. <br />
  The con on these is accurate, and while they have a high damage output they have low HP. I don't think their nearly as tough as Rockhoppers in DS but then again, I'm not a melee. <br />
  Wyvern are dragon type mobs, NOT ANIMALS. Druids can not fear kite them. Same goes for drakes. Drakes are hardly ever hunted by druids/wizards because they are casters. They cast a 500pt AE cold that hits a huge area. Grab one of these on the extremes of its &quot;pratroll&quot; and the kitters will love ya. Grab one next to the dragon ring and everyone will hate you.<br />
  Othmir merchants sell brewing and baking supplies, including a few exclusive items. Get an CS key and you'll be set as the merchants in SS sell everything you need (as well as their being a bank). If you have some regen gear, definatly spend some time fishing for cod and make some wyvern steak for food (since the sauce is cheep and the wyvern meat is plentful.)  Bring along a few things to trade and you might be able to coax some wyvern hides from the quadders (who usualy just sell them to the othmir). Drop rate on hides seems about 1 in 8 (not trying to discourage you, but it definatly means you'll want to advertize while hunting to up your collection rate.). <br />
  more on named: there is only 1 named wyvern and 1 named drake. There should be no more than 1 of each up at a time. Occasionaly something wierd happens and you get a double spawn, but that is unlikely. <br />
  Last tidbits on CS, there are Bulthar and Sirens below the cliffs towards the SS tower, avoid them unless you realy need something they drop. You start off KoS to both, and I have no clue if you can raise faction with either. The sirens are chanters (nothing worse than being charmed and drug under the sea), and the Bulthar have an ungodly number of HP for their level. If you see a wandering Bulthar don't think to yourself &quot;hey, I'll just kill this annoying mob&quot; just zone and come back in a few. Their alot of effort for very little reward.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehehe maybe I should have mentioned this in my initial post.  I am maxxed ally with CoV faction.  Alot of good information here, thanks everyone :)<br />
<br />
I had not thought of going into SS to do any merchant selling/buying because I did not have a CS key but if it's true you no longer need the key to get in and out of SS/CS then it should be easy to buy food/water/bait when I need to.<br />
<br />
You say 1 Pelt in 7 or 8 kills?  That's not really too bad considering Flawless hides drop at a much slower rate.  3 Pelts in 3 hours last night with a Shammy groupie and many multiple Rockhopper pulls.<br />
<br />
I think what I will have to do, before I go to actually farm the hides is go check out where the spawns are and how busy the zone may be for people camping the Wyverns to get an idea.  This will also give me the chance to see for myself if I don't need the key to get into/outof SS.<br />
<br />
Seems I need to ask one final question.  Do both Wyvern's and Drakes spawn in the same location and the Drakes need to be killed for Wyverns to spawn again or do Wyverns spawn in Wyvern locations and Drakes spawn in Drake locations?<br />

At lower levels they can add (I can't remember the cutoff level but it was about level 52/53). Yvolcarn, the named wyvern, may add if you get in aggro range. Someone said that Yvolcarn summons. This is incorrect. You can single pull wyverns without aggroing any others. I'm not sure if the named drake, Azureake, will add while fighting wyverns.<br />
<br />
Arctic wyvern hides are in plentiful supply. They are frequently found on vendors. If you auction in Cobalt Scar, you should be able to buy lots for 10pp or less.<br />
<br />
Drake and wyvern always spawn in the same places and can be timed. The drakes roam a specific path. Azureake and Yvolcarn randomly spawn in one of the drake and wyvern spawn points.<br />
<br />
There are 4 cobalt drake spawn points and 28 (plus or minus one) arctic wyvern spawn points. For wyverns this includes 5 in the Skyshrine tower, 4 around the spire near the dragon circle, a singleton on the spit of land near Skyshrine, a grouping of 3 and another grouping of 2 near Skyshrine. There is another grouping of two and a whole pile of singletons on the cliffs.<br />

<br />
Since the port down from PoK only goes as far as GD, is it possible to bind in SS for those of us that cannot bind ourselves?  I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but I know that a run for dying (if I happen to make a mistake) in CS from PoK would take a while, while being bound in SS would be so much easier to run back.<br />

He did at one time.....of course it's been over a year since I killed wyverns so a lot may have changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take *two* fishing poles.  My first one broke on my third cast (fishing skill 0 when started).  There's also no source of bait in CS, I don't think, if you can't forage it.<br />
<br />
For the record, a 45 cleric can solo a cobalt drake; it's crude, risky, and brutal, and takes 95% of my mana including a quick heal or two, but it can be done.   Plus it leaves lots of time for fishing. :)</div></div><hr />

I think so; saw Azureake start dealing on a 55 who was quadding wyverns on the cliff; his aggro range wasn't huge, but his patrol path covers a good chunk of the area.  It's possible the druid was KoS to begin with, though.</div></div><hr />
