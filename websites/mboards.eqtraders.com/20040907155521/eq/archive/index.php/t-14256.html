<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anubis1179</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got down with my 5th Saw. I am about to start on the 6th I have everthing I need BUT the skill my Tailoring,it is sitting at 128. <br />
<br />
So my question is this, Is wu's armor still the best and cheepist way to get to 158? <br />
<br />
Also is it worth getting to 200+ skill or would it just be better to re fam the drops for the shawls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">crystalline silk can take you to the 130s i beleive.  then go onto wu's.  its cheaper.  wu's trivials at 158.  equip a geerlock and go for it then.  getting higher than that is so hard its easier to refarm?  you already finished the 5th shawl?  grats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can get three easier points doing crystalline silk chest items (to 131), I believe.  After that, Wu's to 158 and LoY ribbons to 187.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Crystalline to 133, then Wu's to 158. I haven't found a cheaper/easier way to do it yet!<br />
<br />
Got 2 characters to 158 already, and 2 more at 115 getting ready to make that push myself. :)<br />
<br />
Plus another at 101, and one at 95 tailoring skill...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">New tradeskill UI makes all this kiola brewing a snap.    Getting to 158 should not be hard.   Then, you can get to 167 on gold ribbons.   Plat ribbons are probably not a good idea - too expensive.   With 167+geerlok, you likely will succeed 6th shawl in under 3 tries, and components are not hard to farm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>drtyaty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why not make Lemming Fur Backpacs; trivial 167 :)<br />
<br />
Sure the components are going to cost you if you cannot forage, but you will recoup them and actually make a profit.  Mine fly off the shelves at 550pp and most of the time I am the only one selling in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
That's what I would do at any rate.  In fact, if that option had been available to me, I would have likely started making them in my 150's I would think.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion, which is subject to change based on what others say regarding the matter, would be to do the crystalline silks to 133 or whatever and then make lemming fur backpacks using a geerlock till the trivial.<br />
<br />
Of course, I do like the brewing option as was suggested above; in fact, that might be the way I would go until they trivial.</div></div><hr />
