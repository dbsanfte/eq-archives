<br />
I just finished fletching skill trade and read a facinating article on how to be a master potter in 4 hours and with 33p...so i figured id try it out.  Heres my results:<br />
<br />
All purchases and crafting done in Kelethin<br />
<br />
Level 27 Paladin High Elf Tunare Skill level 1<br />
Stats (using 2 opal encrusted steins, queynos afternoon tea, and Misty Thicket Picnic plus some armor as we all know)<br />
<br />

STR 123<br />
STA 82<br />
AGI 96<br />
DEX 80<br />
WIS 142<br />
INT 102<br />
CHA 150<br />

STR 125<br />
STA 84<br />
AGI 96<br />
DEX 80<br />
WIS 143<br />
INT 103<br />
CHA 100<br />

i leveled at 36 with medium jar sketch and 122 with medium bowl sketch<br />
<br />
However it took me a LOT more attempts as below<br />
<br />
Med Jar Sketchs 162 @ 1 silver<br />
Med Bowl Sketch 642 @ 2 silver<br />
Med Block Clay 804 @ 4 silver 1 copper<br />
Water Flask 804 @ 1 silver<br />
Total : 55 plat 4 gold 6 silver (better prices then quoted in article)<br />
<br />
Basically - im not complaining at all compared to other skills - it took me 6 to 8 hours (interrupted - a guys gotta eat in RL) <br />
<br />
it just took a lot more attempts than the 300 suggested.<br />
<br />
Good luck to everyone - i do suggest it just expect it to cost a little more and take a little longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just playing devil's advocate, but I imagine your skillup rate would be significantly faster with a wisdom of 305.  For me, even just buying Planar Power to increase my INT from 280 to 305 made a noticeable difference in my skillup rate. <br />
<br />
(I *love* Cassindra's Elegy, since I didn't have to buy any new gear to get the extra INT.  I get 40 extra INT from the song without even using Amp!  I now have tradeskill partners who group with me to mooch my song, so I recommend finding a nice bard who might help you in the same way.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah i did it at close to 200ish int and it was like 80pp and a couple hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Doebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How old was the guild you were reading. Some time ago (a year plus, I don't remember specifically) Sony appears to have changed the skillup rate for Pottery, making it much harder to skill.</div></div><hr />

If you had another 100wis it would have taken several less combines</div></div><hr />

Give him a break :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The guide saying you can get to 120ish pottery for 30p is VERY old. VERY VERY OLD.<br />
<br />
It used to be you would skill up like MAD on pottery, way faster then any other tradeskill. A while back, dont remember how long ago tho, they fixed it so the skill up rate is in line with the other tradeskills.</div></div><hr />
