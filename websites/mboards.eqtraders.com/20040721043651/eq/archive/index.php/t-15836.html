<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Jewel-Crafting Mastery and other craft masteries<br />
<br />
While discussing JCM with Rytan (Ryan Barker), I mentioned tradeskillers' irritation  are at how restricted this ability is.  He said he's open to making JCM available to all classes, or adding similar abilities for the other tradeskills.  He wanted to restrict these new abilities to certain classes again, but I argued strongly against that.  Rytan simply replied that not all classes are meant to have all abilities, and I pointed out that tradeskills are the one area where all classes stand on equal footing -- save for the current lock enchanters have on JC due to this AA.  In the end, nothing definite came of the conversation, but he did mention he could use some feedback on how to proceed with this.<br />
<br />
My personal preference would be to make a new tab on the AA interface labelled Tradeskills.  Move New Tanaan Crafting Mastery and the existing craft masteries into there, and add a new craft mastery for each tradeskill.  Make all abilities in this tab purchasable by anyone, and make them count as general AA's for the purposes of AA titles and opening up archetype abilities.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts or ideas regarding this topic?<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
<br />
Another proposed idea was to create a &quot;Swiss army knife&quot; sort of tool.  This was discussed in the context of super-trophies, but the idea stands by itself too.  When you right click on this item, you would get a &quot;toolkit&quot; for that tradeskill.  For example, the smithing mod item would have a right-click that would summon a Smithing Hammer, File, Chisel, etc.  If implemented on the super-trophy, each tradeskill mod item could summon tools appropriate to the tradeskill.  The devs didn't seem to like this idea, but it was popular with the crowd -- there were multiple calls for a tinkered &quot;Ak'Anon Army Knife.&quot; =)<br />
<br />
Tradeskill con colors are meant to represent your chances of success at making an item, not your chances of getting a skill-up.  Thus, items will con green when their trivial is equal to or less than your modified skill.  This means that if you have a geerlok or other tradeskill mod item equipped, you can get skillups from items that con green.<br />
<br />
For the same reasons discussed in the super-trophies post, there are no plans to raise tradeskill abilities past 250 (or 252 modified) at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can completely understand not wanting to summon tradeskill tools.  That would mean they would have to duplicate every single recipe that uses the original tool to use the summoned tools--either that or the summoning items would be summoning money every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Change sellback value of files and other tools to 0 coin. Really... who cares if you lose an extra 10pp while gming smithing lol. There ar eplenty of recipes in the lower area; some lose more money than others. The convenience offered far exceeds the minor inconvenience for those skilling up. Bear in mind, you can get to 54 for free in the abysmal sea. Whats a file trivial at again? :P<br />
<br />
The enchanter aa really annoys me. Their lock on the enchanting process of adamantite, steel, berellium etc is equally annoying. I'm a loot council officer and the head tradeskill person in an elemental guild, so I deal with this junk on a daily basis. Its irritating with my 250 jc to have to seek out a chanter to do combines. Enchanting the basic ores also needs ot be changed. Combining the ore, and a low end mana vial should do the trick. Enchanters still play a role, in fact its EASIER for them to, as they can bazaar mule the vials, which stack, and would be used for all ore, as opposed to enchanted ore, which doesnt stack. The difference is, you dont have to leash one down while you are doing a lot of combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was and will always be against adding Trade Skill abilities like JCM to only certain classes. It gives a small population free run of the market. Lets say the gives Rangers a Tailoring Mastery AA. WOOHOO for me but for every non ranger tailor thri long hard work of getting 250 skill now is all for nothing. Everything they make I can make easier. This means they no longer want tot ailor because the chance for fail is higher than for Rangers. Like Jewelery is now I NEVER use Jewelery because I can get an enchanter with JCM to make it fo rme with less fails. If JC wasn't so easy Id be angry that I got it to 250. <br />
<br />
Personally I think JCM3 should either:<br />
1. Be open to ALL classes <br />
OR<br />
2. Get rid of it and refund the AAs to enchanters who bought it.<br />
<br />
For me it gives them too much control over one whole trade skill. Yeah you can argue that they are meant to be master jewelers because they can enchant metals. Lets use the same logic on other classes....<br />
<br />
I want Fletching Mastery because Im a ranger and we use bows and arrows all the time!<br />
<br />
He wants Tailoring Mastery because he is a druid and druids are in tune with narute and should be able to fashion skins and hides into terrific armor!<br />
<br />
He wants Smithing Mastery because hes a strong warrior and all good Smiths are strong people who like to beat on things.<br />
<br />
See how crazy this would be? If they gave out more mastery AAs you would get mastery in ONE skill and the other 6 you worked so hard on would be wasted. Heaven forbid you be the class who gets Brewing Mastery instead of Smithing or some other trade skill with a MUCH higher earning potential!<br />
<br />
(Not to say Brewing is bad but hey compare the economic differences!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunthor Warsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Splitting up tradeskill AAs between classes brings back the pre-Tanaan days, basically: you get the &quot;1750&quot; club by having 7 chars, each 250 in a different skill.  If they split up the crafting mastery AAs, it would reproduce the same thing: 7 chars to get the &quot;1750, 50%&quot; club, each of the appropriate classes to have a different Crafting Mastery.<br />
<br />
With things like Tanaan and Aid Grimel, it seemed like they were moving forward with the &quot;tradeskills on one char&quot; idea and away from the &quot;1 full account need for tradeskills&quot; (7/8, close enough).<br />
<br />
Splitting them up is a valid path, but one I really hope the devs don't go down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to agree with the phrase &quot;not all classes are meant to have all abilities&quot; personally.  I think allowing characters to pick one of the seven trades to gain &quot;Mastery&quot; in is enough.  If a paladin wants to get Mastery in smithing, fletching, or even baking, that's fine.  I don't like the idea of restricting certain classes to certain trade masteries like chanters are now, but I also hate the idea of allowing all classes to &quot;master&quot; all seven trades.  If there's a way to allow people to select one of 7 AA abilities (Baking Mastery, Brewing Mastery, Tailoring Mastery, etc...) and upon making their choice, disallowing any of the other six to be bought, I would support that.  Or something similar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tradeskill Crafting Mastery AAs  are necessary to even the playing field.  All players should have a chance to purchase TCM3 for the skill of their choice, with the exception of the ‘restricted’ skills (alchemy=shaman, poison making=rogue, tinkering=gnome, spell research=spell caster)<br />
<br />
In my opinion, this is how it would work:<br />
<br />
You could only choose one and only one skill to get TCM3.  Chanters would be refunded JCM3, (Shamen would be refunded Alchemy mastery, Rogues would be refunded Poison mastery) and they could choose to re-purchase it or go for TCM3 in another skill instead.  <br />
<br />
Shamen, rogues, gnomes and Int Casters would have the additional option of their class specific skills in terms of what skill they could choose TCM3 for , but they could not have TCM3 in more than one skill.  For example, if a Gnome rogue wanted to re-purchase Poison Mastery, he could not get TCM3 for Tinkering too (or for any of the other skills for that matter.)  They already have the advantage that only they can use that skill, which should be sufficient.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is absolutley no reason at all for anyone to be relegated to mediocrity in Jewelcrafting just because they are not enchanters.  This becomes even more important if additional Tradeskill masteries are added.  I will be VERY unhappy if Tailoring or Smithing get a class restricted Mastery that completely negates the huge amount of time I spent learning those skills.<br />
<br />
You really dont want to see a VERY unhappy Ogre....really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heck, look at Tailoring.  Some would say Druids would be the class for it, others would say Monks. After all, Cured Silk, Wu's, Pantherskin, all are monk only (or monk/bst) items, in fact that's why I started tailoring as a monk was so I could make my own armor.<br />
<br />
No one is going to be able to settle which tradeskill should go with which class, and there would be some classes that would get left out because there are more classes than tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Make them all free for all (except the class-specific skills like alchemy and poisons)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Myrron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For that matter, in general half of druids might favor tailoring but the other half would probably favor baking.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Maev, with one exception.  I agree that there should be masteries for all the tradeskills, that they should all be available to all the classes, and that one character should only be able to get one.  I know a lot of enchanters who don't like having JCM, wishing they could have smithing or something else.  Assigning one skill to each class at random, more or less, would be highly unpopular.  I disagree that shamans, gnomes, and rogues should not be able to get the mastery for their restricted skills as well as one of the general ones.  The restricted skills have never prevented someone from participating fully in regular tradeskills at the same time.  (Except perhaps financially!)  I could never justify getting Alchemy Mastery over Smithing Mastery, since Smithing is by far more profitable to me and more useful to my guild.  But it would be absurd for me to have to go to another shaman to make me potions.  Keeping everyone to just one mastery in the regular skills would be enough restriction, in my view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Question.  How would you guys feel about splitting up the three levels of crafting mastery?  Make each level independent.<br />
<br />
So, you could get one level of crafting mastery in each of three tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Or, you could get two levels in one tradeskill and a single level in a second tradeskill.<br />
<br />
Or, you could get all three levels in one tradeskill.<br />
<br />
This allows some degree of specialization for those who want to focus on one skill, and still gives an advantage to those who spend the points but want to spread their skills around.<br />
<br />
The costs should remain the same (3/6/9) regardless of whether you get your levels in one tradeskill or multiple.  You would not be able to get more than three levels total.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to handle the race- or class-specific tradeskills though ... I'll defer to Verdandi on that one.  I rather like her idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In the pre-fanfaire thread there was posted the idea that the super-trophy should increase success rates on combines.  Sort of an item version of Jewelcraft Mastery.  At that time the thinking was that it would be a good idea... enchanters would still have the advantage of using either AA or trophy for that effect.  But when the topic came up at FF it was decided that they didn't want to add such a thing because it would reduce the advantage given by Jewelcraft Mastery.  Sorry folks, I believe this whole notion of increased success (yyy mastery) for everyone has been shot down by the devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a few fanfaire notes to add to KyrosKrane's.  I probably should have posted sooner, but I kept waiting for his 'part 2'.<br />
<br />
The devs have no interest in adding any recipes that would need 1750 skill to complete, other than the super-trophy (and Aid Grimel).  I think you heard this one wrong, Kyros.<br />
<br />
They will, however, consider adding more potato recipes.  And might add a way to break down velium weapons into bricks of velium.<br />
<br />
They have no interest in adding more recipes for recharging items, such as the one for the Mystic Cloak.<br />
<br />
New skillup recipes for raising tailoring 190-250 are very likely.  The robes were just for casters, the new recipes would be for everyone.<br />
<br />
They'll review cultural armors (again) and try to fill in the gaps, including adding froglok cultural.  Two years ago I believed, one year ago I still had hope, but this year I merely observed their facial expressions as they said it so that I could better detect the rest of their lies.<br />
<br />
They will 'check' drop rates for spiderling silks, rockhopper hides, coiled springs, PoP temper components, and Rune of Zephyr.  They'll also consider reducing the number of tempers needed for PoP plate armor to be more in line with PoP chain armor (but not anytime soon).<br />
<br />
They will consider changing merchants to have rotating stock (FIFO).  But they rejected the notion of any more complicated scheme, such as having junk items get rotated out while tradeskill items stay in stock.  They also rejected the idea of putting the hidden slots back... 80 items is the new limit.<br />
<br />
They can add tokens for more types of bags.  They can even add stats to bag tokens so buyers can see what they're buying.  They seemed optimistic that they might actually add this soon.<br />
<br />
They really like the idea of an autoequip area for the bank (actually I'd call it an autobank area).  This was one of the few good new ideas to actually come to light AT the fanfaire.<br />
<br />
They still grin widely and say 'I can't talk about that' or 'I'm not going to tell you' when anyone asks about trolls getting their city back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>banazir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't like JCM3 on enchanters at all.<br />
<br />
A few months after PoP came out, I watched an enchanter make around 1,500,000 in less than a month by making val rings and bloodmetal earrings.  He spent only the 15 minutes each day as he was logging out.<br />
<br />
I personally believe JCM3 was one of the most damaging actions to the economy.  It has eliminated the possibility of doing JC if you are not an enchanter.<br />
<br />
I don't want any new TCM skills, if they are class or race limited.<br />
<br />
I would rather see JCM removed, but I know this would be unfair to enchanters.<br />
<br />
If it is to go in game, it should be open to anyone spending the points.<br />
<br />
Anyone having TCM for a tradeskill, removes the tradeskill from others.  In short, if someone has TCM for Smithing, then you MUST have TCM for Smithing.  Because of the higher success rates, you will pay more for parts.  If you pay more for parts, you shut out others from making those items.  If you don't have the TCM, you can make an item to wear for less money by buying that item from someone with TCM, instead of buying (or camping) the parts to do the combine yourself.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise all the obsessives amongst us would just get aas for every skill, in the same way they got 1750. I'd hypothesise that everyone would have increased success rates, the bazaar would be flooded with the resulting goods and ... prices drop, everyone grumbles.<br />

A single mastery skill would just be a nice bonus for your favourite skill.</div></div><hr />

Enchanting the basic ores also needs ot be changed. Combining the ore, and a low end mana vial should do the trick.

I totally agree with Flabbo.  It is really annoying to travel all the way to somewhere like the Abysmal Sea to work on a skill like smithing, only to find out that you need &quot;Enchanted bar of velium&quot;.  Do a /who and you're the only one in the zone.  Then you will have to chase one down to &quot;help&quot; with the enchanting process.<br />
<br />
I think there should be a vending machine (or NPC) for enchanting and imbuing metals and stones.  Put the metal or stone into a container(like the birdbath at wayfarer camps), include the reagents like gems and what-not, click combine,  and it automatically deducts plat from you, and returns the enchanted/imbued items.<br />
<br />
This would remove some role-play, but would also remove the dependance of &quot;class locks&quot; on tradeskills.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">To some point, it makes a lot of sense that enchanters can make these items, however, it would not be terribly out of roleplaying to have a few rare items that can make them for us.  (They have no problem giving away the ability of shaman to shrink, why should they have problems with taking away enchanter enchants.)  These would like be end game items, or high level ones at least.  One possibility would be a tinkered item that allows you to make the mana vials, perhaps a container that you put the emerald, poison vial and some reasonably priced item, like maybe a CE and voila you get a vial of clear mana back.  It would also be semi reasonable to allow smiths to enchant their own metal, we can make planar enchanted (nightmare iron + distilled mana = enchanted nightmare iron 160ish skill) metals, so sub-planar ones should be a no brainer.  <br />
<br />
The real balancing issue that would come up is not so much the enchanters losing the market, but the fact that enchanters use so much mana to do it, and this could be reverse adjusted, as the imbue process seems to take proportionally more mana than it should anyhow.</div></div><hr />

 Is there any way of checking the lore of something that is on a vendor in the bazaar before you buy it?  I am not aware of any way to do this, and as such it would seem to me like this wouldn't be a complete solution to the problem.  I know I have several times looked at bag tokens in the bazaar, and ended up not buying any because I didn't know the stats.  True you can always check lucy, but once you consider out-of-game tools it seems like you lose the point of adding the in-game method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Meryddian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I want Fletching Mastery because Im a ranger and we use bows and arrows all the time!<br />
He wants Tailoring Mastery because he is a druid and druids are in tune with narute and should be able to fashion skins and hides into terrific armor!<br />
He wants Smithing Mastery because hes a strong warrior and all good Smiths are strong people who like to beat on things.<br />
<br />
Ok. Before there ever was AAs in JCM, enchanters ALWAYS had the lock on JC - why? because we imbue all the metals. In POP you at least saw multiple classes be able to enchant the gems and anybody could imbue planar bars of metal. Great improvents for tradeskillers. <br />
<br />
Now. From a ROLEPLAYING standpoint - and remember, Everquest is SUPPOSED to be a role-playing game - enchanters having JCM makes perfect sense. And yeah, I think that it would make perfect sense from a RPG standpoint to have rangers only be able to have fletching mastery, physically strong classes like warriors and paladins and so forth get smithing mastery, etc. But on most tradeskills it's hard to say &quot;who&quot; should get what ability over another. <br />
<br />
From a player standpoint, yes, I do think it's rough on other players that enchanters have the lock on JC, but then nobody complains about hunting down shamans for sow potions. :P  Like any market, the few who really exploit it makes it rough for the rest. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry that so many non-enc resent my class for our JCM ability but you know, not every player is in a position to &quot;take advantage&quot; of the market - think about it, who is benefitting the most on a new expansion - those people of the level etc to get into zones first and get the loots necessary first, doesn't matter if they have AAs or not!<br />
<br />
There's no point in removing Alchemy or Poisonmaking Mastery AA's; these are CLASS-restricted skills and therefore have zero impact on any other class in the game. Tinkering AAs likewise should be made available (but clearly only gnomes would find any use for it) and stand seperate like JCM does now. <br />
<br />
The only downside for everybody to get AAs in tradeskilling would be the market would have more saturation of product; however, I think making it so that you are either restricted to only one skill (of the &quot;big 7&quot;) going to TSM3, or that you can only get 1 point in X number of skills (ie 1 point in 3 diff skills). Either that, or instead of 10/25/50 improvement (current mastery curves), make it 5/10/20 and you can get all skills. <br />
<br />
On a side note, as an enchanter AND as a tradeskiller, I have always wanted to see more classes able to imbue, especially gems. Why can't paladins, rangers, and shadowknights imbue gems when they MUST pick a diety and are considered priest/melee hybrids? Why can't any caster (whether INT caster, priest or hybrid) of a race imbue their cultural metal?  I never did understand that. It's not like imbuing gems or metals would throw off the balance of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">/agree.. I would like to see a lot more imbued things, and possibly more uses for them.  My personal wish would be to have musically imbued bardic metals! That would rock!</div></div><hr />

In addition, I'd like to see MORE diety restricted tradeskills as well as MORE cultural.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Meryddian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Shamen, rogues, gnomes and Int Casters would have the additional option of their class specific skills in terms of what skill they could choose TCM3 for , but they could not have TCM3 in more than one skill. For example, if a Gnome rogue wanted to re-purchase Poison Mastery, he could not get TCM3 for Tinkering too (or for any of the other skills for that matter.) They already have the advantage that only they can use that skill, which should be sufficient. <br />
<br />
Shaman potions do not make shamans a fortune in quite the same manner as say, JC or smithing does. If somebody sells a player-made item for 100K, a shaman would have to sell 1,000 potions to &quot;make&quot; the same money (and they wouldn't even really make 100K, due to the cost of components; many high-end tradeskill items are farmable and thus &quot;mostly free&quot;). <br />
<br />
Likewise, poisons do nobody except rogues any good. Poison can only be applied by rogues, are used as weapon procs. (only one poison falls outside this rule - the one used in the Thurgadin quest). How is it possible to resent rogues getting PM when nobody else in the game benefits from it and they can't really do much with the finished product except share with other rogues?<br />
<br />
So taking away either of these class-specific tradeskills or saying that if somebody uses these skills *and* wants to do a lucrative tradeskill like JC or smithing or tailoring, too bad, you already picked your class-specific skill. <br />
<br />
Tinkering could more easily be restricted, as they cannot create AAs which are race-specific, but clearly, who else but a gnome will spend AAs on them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think that adding more crafting masteries to the game would be a bad idea.  Though I also think that JCM should be opened up to all classes or removed.  Any crafting masteries that are added would both force tradeskillers to spend ~18 AA per skill in order to still have the skill viable to use for profit/friends, and it would dramatically change the in game economy as the items became more common.  I personally worked my ass off to get 250 in some of the skills I have it in, and I'd not be happy to have to grind (I hate grinding!!!) 18 AA's (or more) just to be able to keep making a profit on my skills.  Limiting it to one skill would be a mistake (especially only giving classes with a class specific skill 1 choice).  I may think that things might have been better before NTCM, but again, I don't want my time and energy getting my skills up wasted.  JC was a total waste, I've never once tried to do a single combine for myself.  The only reason I even got it is because I like having skills maxed, and I'd already started it for the shawls.  With most of my other skills I have and can still make items for myself/my alts/friends/guildmates.<br />
<br />
On a slightly off topic note, do crafting masteries other than JCM currently work?  I know they were broken at least for a while, and possibly still so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Proctus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Funny to see a lot of people from my server (and guild) complaining about JCM and enchanters.  A good portion of our spells are dedicated to enchanting imbueing things for tradeskills, which limits our versatility in other areas.  The fact that it's called &quot;Enchant&quot; such and such kind of gives you an idea of what class it was made for.  There are a lot of Race specific recipes that give people advantages over others in tradeskills (i.e. fletching, tailoring, smithing) yet you come here complaining about Enchanters having a lock in Jewelcrafting.  How about a nerf likewise in fletching/tailoring/smithing for skillups to every race?  Personally, I think Humans would be hit the hardest....<br />
<br />
Oh, welcome to my banned list Renjah!  (No imbues/enchanting for joo!)<br />

You know, the funny thing was that very few people complained about enchanters having the AA for JCM --until-- NTCM points came out... then once EVERYBODY could get 250 for ALL tradeskills, then the complaints about enchanters and JCM (probably because of the value of PoP items in addition to lesser fail rate) started pouring in. :)<br />
<br />
What I find amusing is that people will come to me and pay me for an imbue (ie imbue earth) and run off to get &quot;a friend&quot; to do the smithing combine to imbue the metal bar, and then run back to me and ask for the JC combine, instead of just asking me if I'm smithing-capable too. (trust me, JCM3 doesn't mean I can't fail combines 10 times in a row).<br />
<br />
Proctus was correct however, a significant portion of our spells are dedicated to imbuing and enchanting. If you took those away or spread them among other classes, then what combat-related spells would we get instead? (But that's a whooooooooooole other can of worms).

<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing TSM's for all TS open to all characters. Or if there was some way of limiting each character to one TSM. I think that may be more difficult to code but would mean the market is not overly flooded by easy to make items. <br />
<br />
It would also open up the possibility higher Trivs than 335 (Haven't seen any yet). Balance the chance of making it with a TSM against making the 335 triv without. Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

Everyone can do JC. I have always had a problem with JCM. I always will. Is it not enough that you need enchanters to enchant your metal, imbue your gems and make your mana vials? They already have a stranglehold on trade skills across the board. Lets give them a financial edge as well, yeah, since it has absolutely nothing to do with class balancing in groups like the rest of us are judged.<br />
<br />
If we must have a crafting mastery in a trade skill that is available to all, then refund the chanters, open the CM AA to everyone and let the player pick the craft. <br />

Before POP there also was really no jewelry that didn't require enchanting/imbuing.  There were very few non enchanter jewelers because, frankly, there was no point to doing jewelery other than for the shawl quests.  It was also significantly cheaper for an enchanter to raise jewelry since they could imbue their own metals.  What's the point of doing a combine yourself when you have to pay a chanter to enchant the metal anyways, it hardly costs more to have them do the combine for you and you save all the money you would have spent skilling up.  With POP came jewelry that anybody could combine without a chanter's help.  Except, wait, chanters had this AA that made losses way way less.  Who cares about a bigger lock on a market that they already had a lock on, but POP removed the first lock leaving JCM the only reason that non chanters couldn't make a profit on jewelry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Here are a few more things I managed to remember from the Fan Faire, with the help of some notes I just found.  These notes weren't as detailed as some of the other stuff I'd found, but I'm 90% sure I remembered this right.<br />
<br />
Chance to fail on high skill, low trivial combines<br />
The chance to fail a given combine decreases as your skill increases above your trivial.  I believe it was Tanker who mentioned this, and he said that for every 50 points between your skill and the trivial, the chance to fail is reduced by 25%.<br />
<br />
So, if your skill is 0-49 points above the combine trivial, you have the normal chance to fail as predicted from the formula.  <br />
<br />
If your skill is 50-99 points above the trivial, your chance to fail is reduced by 25%.<br />
<br />
If your skill is 100-149 points above the trivial, your chance to fail is reduced by 50%.<br />
<br />
If your skill is 150-199 points above the trivial, your chance to fail is reduced by 75%.<br />
<br />
If your skill is 200 or more points above the trivial, your chance to fail is reduced by 100%.  The combine becomes no-fail.<br />
<br />
(These numbers could be off by one point; my notes aren't very clear.  It could be 51-100, 101-150, etc. to get the reductions.)<br />
<br />
I don't recall asking whether this checks your modified or your raw skill.  I will guess that it checks your modified skill, but that's just a guess.<br />
<br />
Cash turn-ins for quests<br />
I asked Tanker at one point about turning in cash for quests.  In the text of many quests, the NPC asks for payments in gold pieces or other denominations.  Tanker confirmed that the game doesn't care about the denomination you use to make these payments.  Any combination of plat, gold, silver, and copper that adds up to the required total will be accepted.<br />
<br />
So, for the JBoots quest, Hasten Bootstrutter asks for 3500 gold pieces.  You can safely turn in 350pp, or 3000gp and 50pp, or any other combination that adds up to the total he requests.  The same applies to any quest that requires cash as part of the quest turn-in.</div></div><hr />

I think going the other way would be a much better alternative.  Since enchanting is the class name and the &quot;class defining characterisic&quot; I'd recommend they make KEI self only, adjust mana regen rates to reflect this change, let bards keep mez and charm and remove the lines from enchanters.<br />
<br />
That way enchanters could maintain their lock on enchanting, and they'd still have spell lines for damage (pets too!) as well as stuns, and haste and slows.<br />

 I mentioned this exact point to Tanker. I had told a friend that she could use 350pp instead of 3500gp for JBoots, and Hasten ate her turn-in. Tanker said that someone just before her must have done a partial turn-in which screwed up her turn in.</div></div><hr />

Foraging: Rangers get the skill at level 3,  Druids at level 5 and Bards at level 12.   Also, Wood Elves and Iksar have the inherant ability to forgage regardless of class. You could make a Wood elf ranger and a few hours forage anything you need - IF you wanted to.

This is about giving an unfair advantage on a non-restricted tradeskill, to one class.  If JC was restricted to Enchanters just as Alchemy is restricted to Shamans or Poison Making is restricted to Rogues, then there wouldn’t be a problem, because no one else would be even able to skill up in JC.  But since it is a tradeskill open to all classes/races, JCM should also be open to all. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, SOE should open up JCM to all classes (and add tradeskill masteries for the other 6 skills!) or remove it entirely, but either way refund chanters their AA points and give them a decent AA to replace it.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure why you think enchanters are overpowered - is it because they have a lock on the KEI cash cow?

<br />
LOL no. I mean duh I know we're versatile. (well, most of the time. GoD makes me wonder sometimes.) Again... a can of worms best left to other boards than these, let's stay away from class bashing. AA's are a seperate issue from the spells themselves.<br />
<br />
What I was saying was that we have a *significant* chunk of our spell book dedicated to imbues/enchanting spells: at last look, I have somewhere in the range of ~40+/- spells that do absolutely nothing for me except help tradeskills, should I choose to pursue them (which I did). My point was, if suddenly half a dozen or more pages in our spell book were &quot;nullified&quot; by making the spell ability more &quot;public&quot;, what spells would we receive to make up for that? (of course, that's more worms, let's NOT turn this into a discussion about class powers or lack thereof, I'm simply pointing out an issue that would be questioned). <br />
<br />
What's the point of doing a combine yourself when you have to pay a chanter to enchant the metal anyways, ... you save all the money you would have spent skilling up.  <br />
<br />
The only point of imbuing metal, if all you're doing is grinding out the points in the skill, is to get a slightly greater amount of plat back from the vendors (who clearly value an item with stats more than a statless one). If plat is tight for you, this makes a difference - quite minor, but one, nonetheless. Otherwise no, don't bother imbuing the metal first, you can still get skill-ups off non-imbued combines.<br />
<br />
Again ... JCM reduces the risk of failure, but doesn't eliminate it altogether.  I've got JCM points and lost several PoE combines in a row (and yes, felt really really horrible for my poor guildmate who kept gamely camping the durn things to get himself some new rings). The AA doesn't guarantee a success rate, although yes, I do in general get more successes with it.<br />
<br />
The people who have the &quot;lock&quot; on given markets are those who have access to the base materials. It doesn't matter if I have 1750 if I can't get my hands on the items needed to make the combines.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Mmm speaking of foraging... I've always wondered who's idea it was to require high elf smithing to require lots and lots and lots of morning dew ... when the high elf race and classes are 100% incapable of foraging. (the drop rate of morning dew off Faydwer mobs is too rare to make it worth attempting to farm that way). I'm hoping that'll change to elven wine (to bring it in line with DE/dwarven/ogre smithing) when cultural changes come about, but /shrug not holding my breath. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's now more expensive to skill JC if you imbue the metals on skillup combines.  To clarify what I said, as you obviously misunderstood me:  If I want to make myself some enchanted jewelry as a non enchanter, I need to pay an enchanter to do the enchanting, the cost difference between paying an  enchanter for enchanted metal and doing the combine myself, and just paying the enchanter for the item in the first place is quite small.  Therefore, skilling up as a non enchanter in jewelery did not make sense as the difference in price per item made would only catch up to the cost of skilling up over many many many many combines.  Again, I was not talking about getting imbued metal for skilling up, I was talking about getting enchanted metal to produce jewelry with stats on it, the whole point of the skill in the first place.</div></div><hr />
