<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crickette</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There used to be a post that started off with someome asking why a smith would charge so much to do a combine for them. It then turned into a post where smiths were describing whether or not they do combines and what they charge. It did not seem like the post was very old, but it must have been on the old boards (or I am blind). If you can point me to it, please do.<br />
<br />
One thing that I read that really concerned me is that people were taking advantage of smiths who do combines. They would get the smith to make the item, then sell it on the bazaar, in direct competition with the smith who was kind enough to do the combine for them! After I read this I kinda decided to get out of the combining business. Chances are people have already done this to me, but I am too trusting to even think that someone would do such a thing.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I like being able to help out the less fortunate to get nice equipment, so if I can find a pricing scheme that seems fair and is not so low or so easy that people would commission me in order to resell, I would be very happy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was wanting to review this information, and since I cannot find it, I guess I need to start this new post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daikoku Ashikaga</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not, nor will I ever get tied up in what happens after I hand over an item to someone.  I've never been 'taken advantage of' nor can I  be.<br />
<br />
Of course there are others that have to wring every last copper out of something to call it 'fair' but  I can't play like that.<br />
<br />
If I am in SH/Nexys/Bazaar/PoT/PoK/Cabilis/Thurg/CC not doing anything and you want a combine done I will do it, if I am not around a good zone, or off to do something no simple combine offer is going to be enough.  If you are a friend or guild we can set a time to get together and I will do it.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, since then, I've been slapped in the face over it.<br />
<br />
I no longer do combines for people, unless they are a friend who I KNOW will not turn around and resell, or a guildie.<br />

I enjoy helping people, but unfortunately there are those people who would rather gain from you money wise that ruin my faith in the world =(</div></div><hr />

If you agree to do this, you have to &quot;let go&quot; of whatyou made. Because eventually people will get upgrades, and that item you made for free might be sold at a handsome profit. I try to encourage people in my guild to hand stuff down.</div></div><hr />

Friends and guildmates are one thing... Strangers, well, first time I did a cheap combine for a guy and saw the BP for sale less then 5Min later on his mule in bazaar (for less then I sell them for), I decided 'Screw that'.  I price based of what the items are worth that I'm making.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Same as others above, I have been badly used in the past helping someone I thought was a friend only to have them abuse my generous nature.<br />
<br />
2) I frankly don't have the time or patience to explain everything.  I have told ppl in the past to do their own research and then contact me.  But even after people claimed to have figured out everything they need to do I still always hear the inevitable &quot;oh, i need that too? where do i get that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Essentially, ppl in EQ are too stupid, too lazy, and/or too greedy for me to deal with on the frequent basis that would be required if I did combines.<br />

My best advice to you is simply to talk to the people who ask you to do combines. I generally don't do combines on armor unless its for guildmates, friends, friends of friends, or someone with a very honest reputation. Sickles, halberds, ethereal sheets etc., I usually do for a small fee. Just enough to dissuade people from instant turnaround.<br />
<br />
When strangers ask me about combines I usually ask the following things. Ok yes, i tend to talk alot..<br />
<br />
1. Did you do the subcombines yourself? (It has been my experience that people who do their own tradeskilling appreciate the time and skill of others more than other characters)<br />
<br />
2. Who/What character is the piece for? (People who are willing to talk about themselves, and are excited about who is getting the piece are usually going to use the item rather than use you)<br />
<br />
3. Will this be for a kit or for resale, or will your character be keeping it awhile? (I have actually been able to work out agreeable situations with people wish to resell my items, but I will only do it if they are honest, upfront, and will agree to a minimum resell price.)<br />
<br />
4. Do you have the ingredients ready right this moment, or do you need time to collect? (I will usually not agree to a combine unless someone is ready to go. But I do encourage them to check back when they are ready)<br />
<br />
5. Are you available at XX:XX PM/AM? Or when is a good time to do the combines if not immediately? (I try to accomodate other people's play schedules, but I refuse to let it interrupt my life. I won't be caught logging in just to try and catch someone on)<br />
<br />
I also check the guildstatus, and level of the person. If they are anon , level 1 bazaar mule, someone I have previously seen selling the item, or from a guild with a bad reputation I  will not do combines. If I am unsure, I err on the side of caution and don't do the combine. If I feel comfortable with the person and their request, I will then state my success fee. Which they are of course free to agree to or shop around.<br />
<br />
It comes down to your playtime, and what you want from your hard earned skill. Helping to equip people, and the simple joy of creating is why most of us got into tradeskills. However, helping dishonest folk doesn't warm my heart. I suggest just taking it on a case by case basis. And above all enjoy yourself, its a game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qualtar Shylok</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I concur with all of the above... good to see it also... I dont give combines to anyone... not in a guild so dont have that issue either.  I do get frequently asked to do them though, but the answer is always the same.  NO :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pinepath</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As the original elven smith on Mith Marr, and her main competition I guess  wink my opinion is probably relevent, heh.  <br />
<br />
Actually, I'm not much competition, since I'm not interested in smithing for a living, just as a sideline.  Given that, I rarely make anything but the occasional bracer to sell in the bazaar.  So most of the time folks want to gather their own materials and get someone to combine it, they do come to me.  <br />
<br />
I charge 1000/1500/2500p on success for 1/2/3 sheet items, nothing on failure, if they use their own materials.  Folks who take their own time to gather materials deserve to have decent armor, and I'm not interested in farming materials myself.  However, I do expect them to be using it themselves, I don't make armor for folks who I suspect plan to sell it.<br />
<br />
Upgrades happen tho, one of the nice things about the smithed armor is that it can be handed down or sold when you get something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kieroth_whiteleaf</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my usual scheme:<br />
<br />
If you're a friend or a guildie, free combine, no questions asked. I assume that my guildmates (we're a tight guild) aren't going to use my hard-earned skills for personal profit. However, if I helped a person make a set of armor, and they &quot;outgrow&quot; it later, I could personally care less what they do with it.. Although most of my guild is &quot;tradeskill etiquette&quot; educated enough not to devalue tradeskill items, because it hurts all tradeskillers (which includes a fair number of guildmates) in the end.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, here's my general take:<br />
<br />
I have a set &quot;rate&quot; for any items I can produce. USUALLY it's roughly 3x what it costs me to make. Hard combines might be 10x (ones where there's a LOT of subcombines &amp; potential failures). If you bring your own materials, I take the cost of materials off the top. USUALLY I don't charge if the combine fails, that person is just out the materials. If they've got another set right there, I'll go ahead and knock out the item out and charge it as one combine.<br />
If you want something that I'm NOT trivial at, and you've got the stuff for it, I'll usually do it for free unless you've pissed me off somewhere. Then see above. My motivation for this is that if I'm able to increase my skill at no personal loss that's a good thing for me. On SOME occasions I'll do free combines and even sell the stuff I make close to or at cost just so I can get enough plat for another combine, but that's pretty rare.. usually once I get past banded I don't do it anymore.. on occasion with Fine Steel.<br />
<br />
So far it seems to be working for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krunt</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personaly i no longer do combines for almost anyone.  Ocasionaly a friend can get one out of me but it still envolves me getting tells every hour with thier status in farming components and them asking me advice on where to get stuff.  Much easier for me to do it all and just sell the them at bazaar component cost.<br />
     The only people i will do a combine for are other tradeskillers.  Ocasionally they want some cultural for an alt or, more recently, they need a smithed component to thier pop recipie.  They know what needs to be done and they always pay me well, usually in plat but also in combines from thier tradeskill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oath Hipacraticus</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my take on the combining deal for BD armor from the only 250 human smith on my server(Trib). I will do a combine, as no plat cost, however I ask for 4 times the materials, and they get the first combined item. This leaves them with the product they came for, and me with raw materials. Occasionaly if I make a very early combine I'm willing to try another part, say I make legs on the 1-2 try. As for other combines, if I have the time, I do trivial combines for nothing, but only if I have the free time. I do see the concern over someone making a profit over getting a combine of you as a smith, but, at least on my server that's no longer a problem, over the last month a new human smith has crashed the cultural market by 50% (from 12k per ring to 6-7 now).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I try to be helpful.  I don't mind giving people advice or information, since often times they help me too.  Like when someone shows up with 120 morning dew and only 3 essence of moonlight... I sometimes get a big bonus in extra ingredients if I can provide a few of what they think is rare.<br />
<br />
I usually charge 500 pp just to show up, and if they don't have the right ingredients I'll explain what they're still missing and go on my way.  Sometimes I'll sell them the extra parts if they want to pay bazaar-or-higher prices for them.  Then I charge a significant amount per combine (often 2k or 3k), whether I succeed or not.<br />
<br />
It's possible someone might use me to make a profit (several have, actually, when my success rate was good), but I charge enough that they're really not taking advantage of me.<br />
<br />
These days most people just want the finished armor and have no interest in what the ingredients might be, so it's not as much of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abazagaroth</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my written policy:<br />
<br />
http://www.skylord.com/dragonslayers/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1576<br />
<br />
I do bend those rules on occasion though, friends I'll combine anything for, other GM tradeskill people I'll combine anything for, I've also been known to be a soft heart when it comes to making something for a poor paladin too =)<br />
<br />
All depends on the situation, last night someone had 10 of all components, and wanted me to combine a legs, 2 bracers, and boots for him. He offered to let me keep extra components and pay for the combine.  Since legs take 3 rings he obviously didn't have 10 total tries worth (only had 10 rings worth of components). I told him I'd charge him 5000pp for all the combines. Took 3 tries to get legs, then last ring made some boots. He got Luminant Legs and Luminant Boots, I kept the extra components, didn't make him pay the 5000pp. I've done that more than once when people ask me for special combine requests outside of the guidelines I set, I set a price, if they are willing to pay it, I rarely end up charging them. It weeds out the scammers usually, leaving those trying to stretch their dollar to upgrade their equipment.<br />
<br />
I try not to worry about what happens to items once I've combined for someone, but then, I don't have a lot of &quot;serious&quot; human smithing competition (there are several smiths but none are very active), and I've made my plat so don't worry about it much. Hell, most of my smithing now I'm only selling 1/3 to 1/2 of it to cover costs, then giving the rest away free to nice people, former guildies, friends, etc.<br />
<br />
Serious tradeskillers always get free combines from me. Many have helped me in the past and I try to help them when I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zopharr</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got burned doing combines on the BD armor soon after the stuff came out - did combines for two pieces for someone I didn't know (was still excited that I could actually *make* something decent), and saw the guy selling the items the next day. So I'm not a big fan of doing combines for strangers.<br />
<br />
For friends or guildies, I'll do combines for free, on the proviso that if they ever get rid of the armor they pass it down to a guildie or sell it to me at component cost. Helps out the guild and I don't get competition.<br />
<br />
For people I don't know, I will do combines at 5k a sheet, charging on successes only. (So 5k on bracers, 10k on arms, 15k on BP, etc.) I will make sure the person knows the risks involved - that I had a run where it took 8 tries to make boots, etc. If they are still game, I'll set a time and do the combines for them. Only had a handful take me up on it.<br />
<br />
At that point, they are free to do what they want with it. If they want to sell it, fine - there's not that big a resale market for dwarven and ogre plate on Quellious. I've taken no risk, gotten a profit, and they will probably spend a (frustrating) month trying to sell the item for relatively little gain.<br />
<br />
If they don't like the price I charge for successful combines, I explain to them how I got burned before and thus why I price the way I do. If they still don't like it, I tell them they are free to find another smith. <br />
<br />
One thing I generally will combine for free is mistletoe cutting sickles. I *despised* making sickles to get Zopharr from 242 to 250, with all the myriad subcombines and components. If someone comes to me with the handle, blade and pommel ready to go - or has done the homework and all the running around to get the mistletoe tempers made, etc - my helmet is off to them for putting in the footwork to save some plat. I'll combine until they get one sickle for their use.  That's just me though - I NEVER make sickles on my own now, even for guildies (they have to fetch components as well). I'll also do yttrium sheet combines for free. And if a tradeskiller wants combines - well, odds are good I have a friend who can use their stuff, or I have before,  so we end up trading combines.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's just me. It's worked well for me on Quellious to date. <br />
<br />
Most important is you decide how *you* value your time, come up with a policy that you are comfortable with, and stick with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I dont do it for everyone I havent been abused apart from once and that was when I was less discerning.<br />
<br />
Hardly anyone has ever come to me with all components as they go troppo getting them all :roll: <br />
<br />
Basically I sell off-peak (Oz) and am low volume so I have a low profile so I dont get bothered by scammers the way the on-peak GM's do.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I make gear that I know is for sale to pay back a player who has helped me (Chanting 100000000000000000000000000000 bricks of Brellium for instance LOL) so they can buy spells etc.<br />
<br />
Swaps with another GM (Tailor/Potter etc) is always a winner, have had some very nice deals for both parties that way.</div></div><hr />

Interesting point but don't ever try using that one =)<br />
<br />
The emp no longer drops a staff with charges which used to summon 2 stacks of 20 since they didn't want them to be tradable. Even when that was the case it still took camping 10 shards from all over SoL, getting a glowing orb of luclinite off a standard SoL boss and get a container from akheva which requires an essence emerald. Then repeate all that for everyone in the guild, or how much fun it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are certain categories of people who are not interested in the hassle of gathering materials, and those folks will buy from the bazaar.  If someone is interested enough to learn what is needed and gather up materials, and wants armor for thier own use, I'm happy to make it for them.  It's still a game...I get some use out of a tradeskill I spent time on, earn a little plat, and they get to go away with nice armor.  I don't really see a downside to that.</div></div><hr />

Right on brother!  Perhaps its just the little red hen syndrome, I was the one who did hundreds of shadowscream combines (after spending stupid hours just trying to get the zone to work), and back in the day I was the one who lugged non stacking ore from grobb to ogguk to do banded. Do some research, bring it all, and cough up some cash for a success, or smith it yerself. Ones a hell of a lot easier!<br />
<br />
I will take trades on gear, at roughly half value. Way I figure it, if I wanted to spend all my time auctioning an item, I may as well auction somethin I made myself!<br />
<br />
Some people dont like the cash and carry attitude, but theres not a lot of things I want that arent stupid amounts of plat.</div></div><hr />

People that I've swum through lava looking for the corpses of, finding the zone from Sol A to the lavafall outside the king room in Sol B  (yes, it exists).  These people usually bonk me when I refuse to let them pay me.<br />
<br />
'Friends':  These days I do combines for what they want to pay.  Sometimes I'm a grouch or a grinch, and quote them a price.  I used to make the armor for them for some extra bds, or plat in exchange.  These are people I know, but I have asked for help, and usually are 'too busy' to help out, but can help tomorrow or the next day.  Yeah, sure.  Well, I'm kinda busy today to get to the forge, but maybe tomorrow....<br />
<br />
Acquaintances or Combines for friends of friends:  They better catch me on a good day, or they fall into the next category.  <br />
<br />
Everyone else:  Half the market value of the finished item.  If it's a sickle, better fork over 1500pp.  Black halberd, 3k.  Cultural, 5/10/15k.   Paid on success of course.  You did half the work getting the parts.  I'm doing the other half - putting them together.  Don't like it, do your own smithing.  I'm not Santa Claus.<br />
<br />
Do I feel bad charging?  Nope.  No one helped me get my smithing up.  Not one leather padding came my way.  My friends didn't help me get my smithing up when I was working on it the first time.  One person put herself out enchanting ore for me when I was making armor like crazy.  She's also my bestest eq friend ever ever.  Two of her twinks are armored now.  My guild didn't help me get my smithing up.  Someone in my guild wanted me to do a dp bp combine after she had left me sitting in icewell when I needed a corpse summon so she could go to an xp group.  I quoted her a fee higher than I would quote someone I didn't know.  She went through the roof - I loved every second of it.  It was funny how many 'friends' I got when the new cultural armor came out.  It's funny how many of them are still 'friends'.   <br />
<br />
I viewed every combine from the point of someone trying to take advantage of me.  Cynical?  Yup.  My smithing *was* a fun thing on the side I did to break the monotony of camping and killing.  Suddenly, everyone and their brother wanted me to go spend 4 and 5 hours gathering materials, diamonds, and crafting components for them, without offering anything in return.  Then people I didn't know started wanting me to make stuff for them.   Now....I don't know about you, but no stranger has ever given me 30k when I've walked up and given them 5k.  That's what a successful combine is.<br />
<br />
My smithing, my terms, my skills, and my choice to say yea or nay to thee.  I don't need to do the combine for you - you need me to do the combine for you.  So bring some flowers, some wine, get us reservations at a nice restaurant, and some movie tickets.  And bring your plat.  <br />

If you bring me all of the items and ONLY need the smithing parts done, I will do combines of the items for 3k, and charges are only applied to successful combines. If they want me to do the brewing parts or whatever, i say no. If they bring me the stuff with all the brewing and pottery done, then i will do the smithing combines for them.. <br />

Luckily for me, troll cutural is so completely useless that I will never be competing with these folks. The best troll made items are the ykeshas, but since they have like no stats, they are not much better than a frostbringer at all. That makes them not able to be sold for much more than a frostbringer, like around 15-16k. And with all the cost for blue diamonds, time involved in ground spawns and farming acrylia, etce etc, it just isn't worth it to me to make the stuff. So, I wont be competing and if they choose to resell, more power to them. My method, they put up all of the risk in the first place. I make pure profit. Works for me.</div></div><hr />

I play on Quellious and at one point was in a very small guild. I was looking to help upgrade our MT's armor so I was on *gasp* my level 1 bazaar mule when I came across one of our reknown server smiths. To make a long story short he agreed to do the combines for 5k each if I gathered the components. So I gathered everything up and in the end our MT had some really nice armor that he is still wearing many months later. Thanks Aurthur/Tenasi :) On the flip side there are people who can and will.. happened all the time with JC and still does I am sure so do go with what feels right to you but understand not everyone is just lookin to make a scam off your talent.</div></div><hr />

I generally charge a flat 2k platinum for each successful combine for blue diamond smithing (providing they provide all the materials for the combine and did all the prep work) though I'm not hardnosed about it.<br />
<br />
Charging 2k I find eliminates gross profiteering and mostly keeps people honest.   But I can see where most smiths feel cheated if they do a combine out of goodness of their heart and see their work hawked by a bazaar mule mere moments after you clicked combine.  <br />
<br />
My overall advice though... don't get worked up over it... if you are going to feel cheated, just say no... if you are easy going and simply don't care, feel free to keep doing them for a fee or for free... but the bottom line for me is don't get a coronary over something as trivial as smithing virtual (read: NOT REAL) items in an online game (ie:  something that is intended to be fun).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am less concerned about the resale factor especially if they supplied the components.... it  irks me a little but what the hell, I got a free skillup chance, and they did the farming.<br />
<br />
What finally turned me off on combining for others were 2 events:<br />
 once, before the group success/fail message, a guy accused me of stealing his components. so.. no more of that.<br />
  When they instituded the success/fail messages, I started combining again and was happy for some time until another guy came long, gave me 3 sets of components and I failed on all 3....  he called me a liar about my skill and began to verbally abuse me so badly that I finally had to /report and put him on ignore. He thought that 250 skill meant 100% success.<br />
<br />
Now, I only do combines for friends/guildies/guild allies.<br />
<br />
If I don't know you, I will BUY your components from you, and SELL you the finished product, or you can go skillup yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Joe Gazebo in PoK looking for a fillet knife? I ain't busy?<br />
<br />
Shingen tells Joe, &quot;Go get me ore, water, and a scaler mold. Meet me at a forge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone wanting me to do a few baking combines for PotC? Well... small fee, ktnx - I'm poor.<br />
<br />
I'm actually going out and LEVELLING?<br />
<br />
/r busy - fighting - talk later - ktnx la~<br />
<br />
Oh and to the person who complained about the idiots who say &quot;Well, it's just hitting the &quot;combine&quot; button!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll oftentimes ask,<br />
<br />
Shingen says out of character, &quot;Looking for a Skilled Tinker to hit combine a few times for me, paying as well as I can&quot;<br />
<br />
as a joke, and if someone JOKES about it, cool.<br />
<br />
If they are using it as a bitch (as per your example) - tradeback components, blacklist, ktnxbye.<br />
<br />
After all, not only do people want combines from a tradeskiller, they're gonna eventually want me to buff 'em with the almighty KEI, and remember ladies and gents...<br />
<br />
The 37 'chanter who you annoy might just be the 60 who will refuse to KEI you for no less than 100 plat! (MUAHAHA, gotta fund my jewelcrafting/tailoring/smithing/fletching somehow!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pisaster</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't done many combines for others with my smith, but I've done alot with my tailor.<br />
<br />
If I know them and I know they want for themselves, not a problem.<br />
<br />
If I don't know them and it will raise my skill, not a problem.<br />
<br />
If, right afterwards I see they're just selling what I made for them, I make a note and charge them a flat fee for successes the next time.<br />
<br />
Another thing I'll do:   Player A comes to me and wants 5 of item X made. Fine, I'll do your combines for free, but the 2nd one I make is mine for time and skill.<br />
<br />
Basically though, I'll do combines for free for anything that raises my skill, but I will charge for anything that is already trivial, time is money on trivials.  On trivial items, you're not gaining anything, and if they want item X in volumn to sell, you deserve to be compensated for your time and skill.  If they want item X for personal use, if it's trivial flat fee, if it's not trivial, I'll do for free.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naito</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Shingen said, for guildies, without question.  Anywhere from final combines on Sickles to turning bricks of acrylia into arylia studs and boning.  But then, my guildies are savvy to what is needed, and often have enough skill to put together the pieces.<br />
<br />
For others, from repeat clients to random strangers, I ask for a donation upon success.  (And nothing on a failure.)  The more running around I have to do, or the more of my own supplies I have to substitute for things the client got wrong (MQ ore instead of HQ, for instance), the larger the &quot;appropriate&quot; donation becomes.  And clients who wander off with their new Heraldic BP with only a &quot;thanks&quot; generally aren't repeat customers... :)<br />
<br />
But in all fairness, I have only been stiffed a couple of times.  Almost all of the folks who come to me for armor (donation or flat fee) are polite and understanding.  And resonably generous.  And courtesy goes a LONG way, when you're dealing with a cranky smith who's having trouble focusing on the screen at 2am...<br />
