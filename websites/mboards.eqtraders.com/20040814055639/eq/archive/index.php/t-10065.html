<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caleborus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">JC was my last skill to 250, 1750 finally :D<br />
<br />
I followed Gumkak's excellent guide: http://www.valendor.org/gumkak/<br />
<br />
WIS was 280. I used a geerlok.<br />
<br />
So, from 201--&gt;250, skill-up rate was 50/1292, or 25.8 attempts/point. Overall success rate was: 1214/1292, or 94%. Points gained on successes: 45/50, or 90%.<br />
<br />
My best runs were skills after 1 attempt: skills 209, and 235.<br />
<br />
My worst run was a skill-up after 94 attempts for skill 243.<br />
<br />
I didn't do the math on how much this actually cost me. I'm figuring 8K or so.<br />
<br />
Have fun with the data!<br />
