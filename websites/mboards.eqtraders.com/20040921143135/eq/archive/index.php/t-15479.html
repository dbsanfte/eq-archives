<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xamben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just looked a my combines per skill up so far an i am a little concerned about the skill up rate...<br />
195 =120 combines<br />
196 = 107 combines<br />
197 = 17 combines (got lucky it seems)<br />
198 = 88 combines<br />
199 = 170 combines<br />
200 = 103 combines<br />
201 = 95 combines<br />
202 = 45 combines<br />
203 = 39 combines<br />
204 = 218 combines (man i was pissed)<br />
205 = 111 combines<br />
206 = 136 combines<br />
207 = ??? 150 so far<br />
<br />
now ive read posts that say figure 20 combines per skill up! LOL!!!<br />
I would be happy with 40 combines per skill up<br />
<br />
and before you ask my INT is 255 with kei, which i have the whole time im doing trade skills, and just incase, 240 dex with pumpkin head.<br />
<br />
So whats the deal???<br />
<br />
Should i just forget about tradeskills till i get to 355 int?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're doing arrows, that looks about like what my skillup rate was...<br />
If you heard 20, that might have been for bows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xamben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Really?<br />
<br />
Should i expect a different skill up rate for bows, versus arrows at this skill, i thought that skill ups were linked to stat only, and that the actual combine didn't have an impact, as long as it wasnt trivial. i have been doing S.T.A.A.'s so far, but if it's confermed that bows skill up more often i'll switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aerinha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bows are more expensive though. If you have the cash to throw at it, go ahead with bows. If you don't, acrylia arrows(farming the acrylia and the condensed shadow/ice/fire) is cheaper...even with the massive number of arrows you end up making. <br />
Grand mastering fletching isn't cheap or easy. Or, well, it can be cheap(farm all the acrylia and condensed shadow) or easy(make bows all the way) but not both at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taushar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not only that, I think the rate you are going is about right with 255 INT. For high level casters, the INT and WIS can be much higher than 255. I did most of my high end tradeskills, including fletching at WIS of at least 300. That does make a difference. When you hear people getting a skillup every 20 combines, they are probably talking about having much higher stats.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jayle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just finished fletching a few days ago and overall, I averaged about 15 combines per skillup, but from 200-240, I averaged 62 per.  Has fletching undergone a pottery-like nerf? :)<br />
<br />
When considering &quot;average combine per skillup&quot; I think it's more useful to consider just the 180+ skillup combine average. The low end skillups (&lt;150) really skew the over all numbers and there seems to be a tendency to mislead those new to tradeskilling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fletching was &quot;nerfed&quot; at the same time pottery was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>garet allenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it took you 604 combines to get from 195 to 200 on arrows? <br />
i recently took fletching to 200, and i can assure you it did not take me NEARLY that many combines. i dont' have exact numbers, but i remember it being really easy...like 5 minutes from 195 to 200...<br />
i'm thinking the RNG just had a field day with you</div></div><hr />
