Not on track, not findable (even though they are in the list) and they are not where the map shows they are.  Have they moved?  have they been removed?  I'm on bertoxx server, so may be a server issue.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

It just doesnt find anything that is higher or lower on the z-axis then you. Thats especially visible on the Abysmal Sea. If you are on the upper deck you hardly find a way to the lower deck.</div></div><hr />

Then I would call that broken since you can use the find in other zones even when the z-axis is higher or lower than you.  Take PoK as an example.</div></div><hr />

If Find isn't finding, then that qualifies as broken.</div></div><hr />
