<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BeltiraBelkira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">has anyone noticed any issues with any of the spell combines mentioned herein? the LOY ones that is? i tried to comebine what it says for stun command and ended up getting circle of summer. Of course if the combine mentioned here in works then the only possibility that i can think of as to what happened is the person i had comebine put in the wrong component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chantmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The components are correct:<br />
Flake of Lodestone <br />
Rune of Transpose <br />
<br />
Circle of Summer requires:<br />
Flake of Lodestone <br />
Rune of Ellipse <br />
<br />
I have made both of these spells and this is correct.<br />
Someone must have made a mistake in the combine.<br />
<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ishkandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">on EQtraders, the spell Avatar is listed as y112L/R + words of virtue, and in winding my way here from ezboard to this current incarnation of the forum, i discovered a post that listed the recipe as being y112L + y102R + words of virtue, and a subsequent post saying it was fixed.<br />
<br />
is<br />
<br />
y112L + y102R + virt<br />
<br />
in fact the correct recipe and if so... you might want to fix it on the EQtraders site.  i'd take it to my nearest local researcher, but virt is 2K on povar atm, and i saw if for 1K recently and unfortunately balked at the cost, so i don't have all 3 components.<br />
luckily, i only paid 9pp for y112R and only 20pp for y102R, but still, i'm hoping now that i have the second &quot;correct&quot; component, it really is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chantmon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, that is correct, I have made several of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qaladar Bragollach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Avatar is yaeth's 112 left, yaeth's 112 right and Words of Virtue. I have made it many many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ishkandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">which is correct, chantmon?</div></div><hr />
