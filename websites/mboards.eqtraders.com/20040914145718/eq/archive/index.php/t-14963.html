<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BiggusGeekus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks of 250 skill!<br />
<br />
How much did this run you from start to finish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2184 total combines...<br />
<br />
462pp 3gp 7sp 8cp, counting 170pp for KEI donations...<br />
<br />
Plus the corking device. (I spent 300 for ingredients and had a friend make for me for free)<br />
<br />
if your INT/WIS is already 255+, then you can do it for 300 plat or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">408.235pp<br />
2377 combines.<br />
<br />
Cost was actually much lower since I sold the Kaladim Constitutionals, and Qeynos Afternoon Teas I made.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You folks got my attention. How do you know how many tries and how much? Did you parse the log?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can't say I did anything 'wrong', per se, because I just today GM'ed brewing, but... less than 500pp?!<br />
<br />
I spent... Roughly 1400pp.  Granted, as a Bard, I didn't try really hard to get my int/wis very high, and most of my KEI were free...<br />
My path, if I recall, was veggie oil (pre fetid essence), skull ale, faydwer shakers, MHB, KC.<br />
<br />
Only in the last... two weeks/800 combines did I have int over 200...<br />
<br />
What'd I miss?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did 0-250 in 3 days.<br />
<br />
Fetid Essence to 122<br />
Ol Tujim's Fiere Brew to 135<br />
2X brewed 2X stout dwarven ale to 142<br />
Faydwer Shakers to 188<br />
******************************* The above was day one<br />
Mino Hero's brew to 248<br />
******************************* The above was day two<br />
Kaladim Constitutionals to 250<br />
******************************* Having a corker made, and doing KC's was day 3.<br />
<br />
I then sold the 208 KC's I made (52% success in a 100 count run) for 15plat each, netting me a profit of aproximately 1.3K (after the cost of Skilling to 250, the price I paid for a corker, and the price to make 100 KC's taken into account) overnight and early into day four.<br />
<br />
As far as knowing how many combines, and how much I spent. I meticulously wrote it all down as I went. I recorded ingredients prices down to the copper. I kept track of attempts, successes, and number of skill ups per stack (20 attempts), and partial stack when I reached a trivial on one of the recipe's I used. I Filled both sides of a sheet of paper with notes as I was going. :)<br />
<br />
It was a bit tedious recording it that way, but I really wanted to know just how cheaply I could do it (was on a 20th level wizard). You can get to 248 for less than 300pp following the path I used above, 'IF' your INT/WIS is 255 or higher already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I stayed closer to the trivials on my skill up path, as people who've done extensive parsing on smithing skill ups found it was faster that way. Not such a big consideration these days with the new UI. Check the quick trivial list in the recipes section.<br />
<br />
No idea what it cost, but selling all the Kaladim constitutionals I had left over when I reached 250 would have much more than covered it - If I hadn't attempted the GM trophy 3 times :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, that's one thing I didn't do - sell my successes.  Ended up with about 11 stacks of KC, and 56 stacks of MHB ;)  but that's okay, going to end up using em anyway.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the breakdown, Balkin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Welcome!<br />
<br />
I must also add, that it took me 2 tries to get my GM corker.<br />
<br />
That's roughly 9K spent, which took several 100 count runs of grobbs and KC's to cover. :)<br />
<br />
Happy brewing everyone! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nairn Niteraven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I digress a little bit from your original question; you should make money on Brewing in the long run. I've got a couple of Druid friends who like to hang out in East Karana, and they regularly give me enough Tea Leaves to make Qeynos Afternoon Tea in batches of 500 or so at a time.<br />
<br />
You won't make a fortune all at once, but it's good, steady money. I've probably taken in 300k on this one item alone on Veeshan.</div></div><hr />
