<br />
There are more than 40,000 unique items for players to discover, create or buy within the game.  More than 3,000 of these items have never been discovered by players.   <br />
<br />
I wonder how many of the 3000 are undiscovered recipes?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well they did write the release before any guild got fully through GoD so it stands to reason a lot of those items may be drops that havnt been discovered in the high end GoD zones.</div></div><hr />

I'd bet there's two or three in there. :D<br />
<br />
Well they did write the release before any guild got fully through GoD so it stands to reason a lot of those items may be drops that havnt been discovered in the high end GoD zones. <br />
<br />
Actually, they're not. I removed those before performing the count. :)<br />

example:  We still don't know what Lewena's favourite drink is.  Brodder's Revenge has been made, but if there is a drunk that will spill the secret of the drink after we sober him up with some of B.R., no one has found him yet.<br />

Thanks for the info, though!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Angahran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Would be interesting to know how many of these 3000 items are actually possible to get.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
 Is the mob that drops the item in the game ?<br />
<br />
Is the quest for the item possible to complete ?<br />
<br />
Are all parts of the recipie in the game, and is the recipie itself in the game ?<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Ang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sylphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's all sorts of possibilities:<br />
<br />
1. Drop table was changed, item can't drop.  I know several examples of items that dropped for a very short time, and then never did again.  If nobody got one that week (or didn't save it), it'd be counted.<br />
<br />
2. Drop table was always bugged, item can't drop.<br />
<br />
3. Norent items.  There are many, and they would of course not show up in a search of the database during or after a patch.<br />
<br />
4. Items removed from inventories.  Sometimes it's an item that gets fixed by having a GM swap it out, other times there's a bug that just deletes a particular item from everyone's inventory (yes I know of examples).<br />
<br />
5. Broken recipes (and broken component recipes and recipes where one item doesn't drop).<br />
<br />
6. Broken quests (and subquests).<br />
<br />
7. Subquest parts.  People doing a quest usualy don't stop halfway through, and in fact usually move on to the next step of the quest in a few minutes or less.  Any intermediate items might not exist in any banks even though the quest gets completed every day.  This also includes very rare quest parts -- anyone who gets one is likely to go finish the quest right away.<br />
<br />
8. Artifacts that were never given out, or were given out the first year and those folks since deleted their characters and quit EQ.<br />
<br />
9. Items nobody wants -- some things that are worth 0 copper, or are useless except to sell, or are for quests nobody cares about, will simply not be kept.  Such an item could be well-known and 'found' but nobody saved one.<br />
<br />
10. Tradeskill items nobody makes.  Almost all recipes get made at least once... but there might be some particular combination of meat and sauce, or one particular type of dry fly, or one particular 5-dose potion that got skipped or got made once and was since deleted.<br />
<br />
Without knowing more, I just can't make myself believe that about ten percent of all items 'have never been discovered by players'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>velk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So having done this wonderful statistic, now would be a great time to flick through this list and discover *why* these items have never been discovered by players 8)<br />
<br />
I am expecting a few things like &quot;Hmm, noone has ever made any of the 500 vah shir cultural tailoring recipes, that seems a bit odd !&quot; 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mewkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since there's like 1,000 some odd different types of arrows that can be fletched, some of which are considerably worse than much cheaper ones, I'd be willing to belive that a good 500 or so of them are arrows that no one has even bothered to attempt make. Maybe even some of the combinations of bows as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>oerin trubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm,<br />
<br />
And what about blue ore . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are almost 100,000 trees within the world of EverQuest. <br />
<br />
I wish they would take out more of the trees.  They cause so much lag.<br />
<br />
I am not surprised with the 3,000 undiscovered items.  There are still lots of quests that are unsolved, some of them bugged, and some of them just have not been solved.  The permutations required for recipie combines are just insane.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll bet that two of those items are the Onyx Encrusted Urn, and the sketch that's needed to make it.  AFAIK, the sketch has never existed in the game, although the recipe was apparently published in the Kunark game guide, a patch once mentioned the item, and its apparently listed in the tradeskill UI (something I haven't personally checked, even though I should probably be able to see it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">alot are probably GM items /chuckle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This reminds me of the original Fiery Avenger quest that Verant swore up and down was in game. Groups of paladins across all server went through every single NPC in every single zone (there weren't that many at the time) saying a long list of possible keywords to NPCs and found nothing. They found many other quests but no Fiery Avenger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Saleani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I suspect a lot of the 3k undiscovered items are like the honey mush bread in cabilis: you couldn't buy it or make it until 4 years after the release of the expansion because it was not in the game. There was a no-drop chunk of spirit ore that used to drop in city of mist. Mining databases showed a couple items with adjacent numbers, but no one found any quest with them. It looked to me like it was for a ranger quest. All those no drop ores that used to drop in the pre-revamp Hole, well, I could never find a recipe to make them into anything, and I sure tried. Maybe they were for a hand in to a mob that didn't spawn, or that issued the wrong item for 4 years, like the iksar hermit in west cabilis. Once he started handing out the right item (a 4 slot container), folks figured out the quest in a couple of weeks. Or like when the Ivory Sky Diamond did not drop in the game for at least 9 months (drops from the Spiroc Lord, a mob that used to be farmed quite regularily and used for the haste belt on my profile, it only took me 14 months to complete that quest).<br />
<br />
My intuition tells me that there is a warrior serial weapon quest that might be as nice as greenmist (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7029) or skyiron cudgel of the ancients (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12497), but I don't have a warrior to try to find them out. Nor the time to do so.<br />
<br />
How many of the undiscovered items were related to the quests of the Primordial Malice dark elves in Lake Rathe who were removed from the game before they were debugged? I don't know either.<br />
<br />
The only Mithaniel's Defence (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1113) appears to have dropped on Test before the famous wipe. No one I know who farms/farmed VP has ever seen one drop. Even back when you could not port out, and had to fight to one of the 4 porters to leave the zone.<br />
<br />
Due to a database mix up, someone posted a recipe that showed up when they learned something else. It implied that there is a PoTorment tailoring theme. I sure hope that it does not take the bloods from PoTorment, since one of my guildies spent 2 weeks there and only got 6 bloods. 20 hours per blood is way too low (I know they only drop in the belly event, and when the mobs that can drop it spawn, there are always 2, but it still worked out to be ~20 hours per blood).<br />
<br />
Call me cynical and jaded if you want to, I don't mind. I will have to see it to believe it.</div></div><hr />
