I keep hearing how expensive Smithing is.  In my attempts to do it cheaply i ran accrost a fact that seems to be missed.<br />
<br />
Take 3 Small Pic of ore and Make a Small Block then sell it back<br />
a stack of 20 Small Pic with the Merch Seeing me Warmly Gos for 1 Plat 8 Gold.  I can make 6 Small blocks that sell back at 3 Gold 8 Silver a peace.  I know this is tireing and Painstaking but I get a 200% profit.  I keep this up and dubble my plat trip.  So buying 6, 20 Staks of Small Peace and selling back Half the sheets and Keeping half I can get my molds and Keep erning plat along the way. Is anyone else doing this?  <br />
<br />
Also Because this is Trival I willing to Let anyone staring make my Small Blocks for me. This will be free for you and get you a good start of a skill of 31.</div></div><hr />

It is widely known that smithing is inexpensve to get to 188. It is after 188 that it gets either outrageously expensive or time comsuming (depending on how you chose to skill up at that point).<br />
<br />
Also, depending on the size of your bank account, you might also consider the fine plate portion of skilling up rather expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zugwugger</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:shock: I see.  Want is a vets Idea of expensive?  Right now i'm turning a profit and i'm at 87 moving up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   Well, let's just say that after you hit 122 (embroidery needles) it starts getting rather expensive in terms of either plat or time. To trivial out fine plate at 188 will be &quot;relatively&quot; cheap, 6-8k - assuming that you hunt for your own padding. If you do, say, ornate chain and electrum ornate chain to avoid doing the &quot;Padding Quest&quot; until after you hit 148, then tack on another 12k or so (say figure 20k total to get to 188 going that route).<br />
<br />
   The it get's really expensive in terms of either time or plat. You can go the &quot;fast&quot; expensive route of making mistletoe cutting sickles (about 300pp a combine) from 189 to 250 - uses all store-bought stuff, costs about 400k I'd guess to get to 250 going that route. (You'll make part of it back selling sickles, but not until you've gotten up a ways). Or you can go the less expensive route of skilling up on shadowscream, but that requires you to kill lots of mobs in their 30s or so- so not really an option for awhile.<br />
<br />
    Stick with it, though - you can still make some plat selling banded and plate, enough to pay for smithing get you decent stuff for someone in their teens and 20s. Then you can level for a bit more and then start working on shadowscream when you are a bit higher up. Use the auction channel-I've seena few people asking for fine plate, but generally don't make it any more, and will start referring them to you. Good luck!</div></div><hr />

I'll be getting the Rest of the Cheap Skill up's today then.  I've EQ Gold on order (Amazon said it was shipped this morning) then I'll Have POP.  For Now I'm working the Banded a bit more till 122 Atleast then I'll be moveing around a bit Leveling (still only 8), and I think I'll offer Fine Plate after that and work the rest after i save a bit.  So far to get to Smithing at 91 making my own Bricks Out of Peaces I've profited.  took a 25 plat starter from a few investers.  So if you see me in Feerott I'll be selling banded COM for now and Ordiant Chain when I hit Qeys.  If anyone wanting to start Smithing comes around I'll fund there first 31 Skill ups with Ore Brick Making.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wombat</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will need cash to get your strength up and increase skill ups. I suggest you dont sell under 1pp/ac per peice of banded. You will also need money for better weapons and armour than you can currently make so you can cash farm to support Fine Plate making.<br />
<br />
Once you hit level 20 hunt EF for Mammoths, tusks sell for 10pp with good faction an charisma, selling back plate to merchants makes a small loss with good faction/charisma, its the fails that hurt (BP's especially!). I funded FP on dead mammoths and Smithed in Freeport. padding was gained in the EF newbie zone. Also sell bags from the HQ and Grizzly bear skins you get.<br />
<br />
After Mammoths its Splitpaw/Aviaks to level/loot so you can kill Hill Giants in RM for cash (to fund more Smithing)   :D .<br />
<br />
When FP is done have a look at levelling in Tenebrous Mountains for acrylia as well and doing Old Cultural to help skill up.  Shadow Scream is the road to madness btw  :roll: , but is effective if you have a reliable connection (no Rent parts) and dont mind ppl commenting on you acting stange!  :shock: <br />
<br />
Just remember there's nothing more impressive than am Ogre in full New Cultural  :)  (except a Dwarf in it!  :D  )</div></div><hr />

I've made it to 141 right now Farming padding (actually taking a bit of a break from smithing) and planning on doing the Val Shar Smithing Quest now to start the shadowscream (hey i'm lvl 34 and going to be hunting lvl 30 Mobs go figure).   What I'd Like to add is what smithing and trade skills really are.  A game and World With in  EQ all it's own.  I've spent Most my money on smithing thinking it was a bit expensive but then i relized with the interaction i've done, the people i've meet and the Items I've aquired Zugwugger is Much more then he ever Could be had he not Become a Smith.  <br />
<br />
I'm Wearing a Full suit of Imbude Ogre Splint Mail (check the stats and see how many who arnt Twinked or were given stuff are doing better).  I've Given away about 5 Imbuded Ogre War maces(30pp for meterials).  and bout 8 or so Ogre Bouncer shields(20pp) to newbies.  I've made about 10 Suites of Banded armor (3 complete sets at once the rest oods and ends).  I made 2 Stacks of Bonding, 2 Stacks of Studs that sold for 140pp.  Got recruited in one of the friendliest Guilds.  Wasted 900pp on trying Ord chain(4 skill ups OMG was i pissed). and basiclly i can say i've made and lost about 5K at lvl 34 smithing.  but gained so much.  And i'm not saying how Long it took me to relize Wombat was a guildie (get a more consisent Sign buddy)... lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wombat</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A red dwarf by any other name still smells like a red dwarf!   :roll: <br />
<br />
Thats why I put my signature at the bottom  :D <br />
<br />
Ahh yes I snapped up Zugg for the Guild when I saw him doing CR's trying to collect Dwarf blud in BB while I was omw to smith in Kal. I had seen his posts here earlier and our reasonably trade heavy Guild didnt have an Ogre smith yet. Gave him my old geerlock and he hasnt looked back since  :!:<br />
<br />
Incidentally for a northern hemisphere type Zugg has coped rather well with crossing the cultural divide to an Oz guild (we do have several other northern hemisphere members also  :P  ). We have a T shirt in Oz that features a Wombat with the slogan &quot;Eats, Roots and Leaves&quot;. This is particularly popular with young Grunts in the Oz Army  :roll: <br />
<br />
Coping with the 64 possible meanings of the word Bastard and avoiding social gaffs eg saying &quot;I'm &quot;rooting&quot; for my team&quot; has an entirely different meaning south of New Guinea, heh, heh, can be traumatic for some  :P  (at the age of 15 I had a sweet young female exchange student Teacher from Canada say to my classmates &quot;I was always rooting for my team back in Manitoba&quot;, the class erupted into pandemonium at this and her blushing supervising teacher had to escort her out of the class and show her an Oz dictionary!)  :D</div></div><hr />
