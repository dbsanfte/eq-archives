First, there is no indication that this is intentional, or that it will be permanent if it is intentional.  The angry and accusatory tone is unncesary and counterproductive.<br />
<br />
Second, there is another thread on this topic that is up to two pages of posts and that has never been more than halfway down the first page of this forum.</div></div><hr />

It was unintentional, and they state (Tanker's post) that they want everyone to use the new UI for CEs.  They are just trying to figure out how to do this.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the record, the purchase of GoD has nothing to do with the new UI.  They are two separate things that happened to be released on the same day.<br />
