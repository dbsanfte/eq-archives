<br />
32 Highland lions killed:<br />
5 LQ skins<br />
2 MQ skins<br />
0 HQ skins<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me if this is the normal drop rate or if im just having terrible luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have killed hundreds and hundreds of highland lions in NK and I have yet to find a HQ lionskin. I have only seen two 1 bought off a vendor, and one bought from another player. So I know they exist.  I would have to say that your results are more than normal.<br />

Just coast the bazaar till you see someone selling at around 100pp.. a steal if you ask me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marteeny</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hunting lions mainly for pelts, but hoping to get some HQ skins at the same time. Over countless hours, and after collecting about 125 each of hq and mq cat pelts, I never saw a single HQ lion skin. I have easily killed 300 lions. So no, you have not had bad luck. They are just that rare.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pockets FullOfGold</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HQ LION pelts only drop off of Highland Lions in North Karana.  You are getting that mixed up with HQ Cat Pelts which can drop off of any lion type.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calabar</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is just a case of Murphy’s sense of humor, as in Murphy’s Law.  The first time I hunted in NK, not long after first starting this game, I got a HQ lion skin off the first lion I killed and my friend’s jaw almost hit the ground.  But when I hunted there later for the purpose of getting a HQ lion skin I never found one.  Then, a few weeks ago, when I took my necromancer to NK to hunt bugs, a highland lion attacked me and to my complete surprise it dropped a HQ skin.  So I think the secret to getting a HQ skin is not to hunt for one.</div></div><hr />
