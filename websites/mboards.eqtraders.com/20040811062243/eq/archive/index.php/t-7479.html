It's easier to deal with if you just bend over and take it.  I posted on Ascent's boards for 2 months afer they hit elementals till they finally said stop bugging us A-Hole(or something like that)  :P <br />
<br />
With AoM getting elemental access last night, I have a feeling that we'll be starting to see alot of stuff hit the bazaar.  Might just be wishfull thinking, but we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wayshaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ever wander why you dont see any of the elemental tradeskill stuff for sale?  apparentlly those guilds have a rule,  members of their guild are not allowed to sell elemental tradeskill stuff  or completed items outside of guild or you get kicked out.  <br />
<br />
So even if you grind in ele planes (yea, ive heard of grind groups) and get stuff, no matter how you acquire the components, you can not sell them and if you make items, your not allowed to sell them or they kick you out.<br />
<br />
We tradeskillers allow this?  we allow people to dictate to us, who have busted our ass to get our skills high, allow them to tell us whom we can sell to and whom we can not sell to?<br />
<br />
Comments welcome<br />

Nope. <br />
<br />
Not to whom, when or for how much.  Ever.<br />
<br />
Alas, that's one of the reasons I still have no guild tag after my name, which also results in a lot slower level progression and probably no chance in Norrath of ever achieving my epic.<br />
<br />
But what the heck, it may take me several more years, but I'm shooting for membership in the 1750 club.  Those psychos are my kind of people!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taugur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey hey hey, no more control?<br />
no more anger over undercutting rogue traders anymore?   :twisted:  <br />
<br />
Getting there is really a guild/team thing, those traders would still be chasing spiderlings in steamfront if it wasn't for their guilds. So it's only fair if the profits are controlled by the team in this case.<br />
<br />
But it will all soften up once all the twinks are equipped... just wait a few more weeks /comfort</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">to be honest is not necessarily a bad thing.. but think of it this way.. the guild leaders probably want to curtail certain players from reaping in alot of PP from the sales of elemental plane components and/or items, before members in the guild get a chance to have for themselves.<br />
<br />
my guess it wont last forever.. we shall see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kyrsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I find it humorous. I think the way they handled PoP is freakin' ridiculous. And not even from just a tradeskillers point like I have. Watching the frustrations of the higher level guilds and lives pretty much wasted Raiding over and over, I have to wonder how much of this game is even enjoyable anymore or even relatively constructive or even not broken content.<br />
<br />
I've vented over the control guilds have had over tradeskill drops in the planes for quite some time. I was probably the first person on the server to make any PoP tailoring but you hit a ceiling and can't go any further because of the stupid flagging system they have. I find the people DEFENDING the guilds doing this happen to belong to uber guilds. Well, I don't belong to any of those guilds and I am tired of the sh*t and expectations they place upon potential members. I've watched people in these guilds get bored and decide to max out their tradeskills so they can do stuff like that Aid Gimel quest that /I/ can't even start yet.<br />
<br />
So basically.. PoP is a big load of crap. The game has gone to sh*t and the only thing I find even remotely enjoyable is chatting with friends on there. EQ has become yet another chat window I keep open. Ah well, just thought I'd add my two cents to this board since I do happen to have an opinion. Off to work now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">not everyone has a kind and gentle spirit like you do Kyrsk.  Verant obviously didnt see the flaw in having certain component drops in certain zones... which requires a &quot;guild-size&quot; raid force to gain access.  Its only now in hindsight, they are even attempt to rectify that situation by removing the restriction on all teir planes under elemental zones so that everyone (NOT in a UBER guild) can enjoy the game as well.<br />
<br />
This is what I can see happening, and you think the Bazaar prices are BAD now?  remember the post I made about how some POP drops are going for from anywhere from 1-10k PER item.... well can you imagine what it would be like when you see elemental smithing, tailoring, pottery, etc.. hit the market?   It will be like the secondcoming of the Solstice Earring Quest.. where those who DO have.. will reap a #^%&amp;# load of PP and those who have not... will have to just bare and grin it.<br />
<br />
I honestly DONT farm elemental planes.. I do only what is required and the rest I give to members/friends when able.  I help people get the things they want/need.<br />
<br />
I know what its like to be on BOTH ends... when I was trying to buy POTC earring parts.. and getting bent over backwards to get those 9 parts for around 20K!!!!<br />
<br />
btw, robes are sickles market is sickeningly cheapright now..  900pp each<br />
<br />
 :?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>matteo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PoP expansion has always been advertised as an expansion for the high end folks.  With this in mind, I really do not understand why people get upset that elemental tradeskill items are not available to them when they are not in a high end guild.  <br />
<br />
These guilds spend a tremendous amount of time on the development of their members so they can continue to advance.  It only makes sense that they will reserve extremely rare elemental tradeskill components for their members.<br />
<br />
Read that last line again...  &quot;extremely rare elemental tradeskill components&quot;.  Most elemental tradeskill items have a stupidly rare component.  I have been in the elemental planes for several months now and still have lots of members that want elemental tradeskill items.  Last week I spent an entire night in PoA with a raid force and saw enough components looted to make *1* ceramic totem of xegony.  Should we put those on the market or reserve them for our guildmates?  Pretty easy decision.  <br />
<br />
All guilds look out for their interests first.  Don't get pissed off at high end guilds for doing the same.  Get upset at Sony for creating a situation where tradeskill items are not available to all the people that spend time on them.</div></div><hr />
