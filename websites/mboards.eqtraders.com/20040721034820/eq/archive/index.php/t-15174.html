<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Estariel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I make no claims to be any kind of expert on smithing, but I have been surprised by the omission of the Fishbone Dart Tool from the skill-up guides.<br />
<br />
As a high-elf paladin I looked around for what to make after Embroidering Needles go trivial at 122 and I came across the Fishbone Dart Tool which (according to EQTC) goes trivial at 140, and therefore cuts out the early part of the Ornate/Fine Steel haul.<br />
<br />
Uses:<br />
4 small pieces of velium<br />
3 coldain velium tempers<br />
1 scaler mold<br />
<br />
Now that the temper sells for 6pp in Thurgadin, each combine costs about 20pp, plus the velium cost. The velium can be farmed in nearby Velks or CC or power-shopped from the Thurgadin vendors. This combine seems to be comfortably cheaper/faster than the parallel options involving leather padding or ore.<br />
Leather Padding is trading at 40pp on Xegony atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Which recipie are you looking at?  This is the actual recipie for the fishbone dart tool, and trivial, unless it has been changed since being implemented:<br />
<br />
Smithing Components: coldain velium temper, scaler mold, velium bits(2)<br />
In: forge<br />
Yield: 1<br />
Trivial at: 146<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, it is a different skill up route that is now cheaper due to the lowered cost of the tempers.<br />
<br />
According to Lucy, it is not lore, not stackable, and only has a value of 1sp 2cp.  So, this is going to be similar to the EVB on which you are just throwing money at smithing.  At least with the ornate chain and LDoN chain you will make some of the money spent back.  But, lacking raw data on skill ups, it will be a little hard to say whether it would be a more viable skill up route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Estariel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, the UI says trivials at 146, not the 140 quoted on EQTC.<br />
<br />
Velium bits are made from Small Velium pieces and tempers, so my list was a list of ingredients rather than a recipe.<br />
<br />
I take your point regarding the cost, as opposed to say Ornate Chain. As a level 65 character, the plat was less of an issue to me than the time and reliability factors. <br />
<br />
The result isnt stackable, but there is a vendor right next to the Thurgadin forge, where this combine is most sensibly made. The scaler mold and temper vendors are a short walk away in Thurgadin.<br />
<br />
As for skillup rates, one batch I got a skill up on 40% of combines.<br />
The other batch, I got a skill up on about 20% of combines.<br />
Thats with a STR of around 280.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're gonna farm the velium, why not just farm the leather padding too.  There are tons more zones to get leather padding than velium (especially at lower levels.)</div></div><hr />
