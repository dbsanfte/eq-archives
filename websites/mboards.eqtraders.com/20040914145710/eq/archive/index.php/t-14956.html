<br />
Erollisi Marr<br />
Rodcet Nife<br />
<br />
Why aren't they in planes of power, if they are considred Deities, as compared to sub-deities, but yet the zek brothers also appear and so does Saryrn, who are considered sub-deities, but yet Druzzil Ro does not?<br />
<br />
Also, if Solusek Ro is Fennin Ro's son, is Druzzil Ro his mother? Just curious ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd  *LOVE* to see Erollisi in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd kill the wench every time she spawned, just so I could have the satisfaction.<br />
<br />

<br />
And no, I'm not jaded or bitter because of past relationships, why do you ask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, that's easy enough to answer.  PoP is largely concerned with a specific storyline -- the conspiracy of certain gods (and goddesses) to destroy or expunge Norrath in retribution for Zebuxoruk's attempts to disseminate his knowledge.  <br />
<br />
Only the &quot;villains&quot; of the plot (the Zeks and Solusek Ro), the &quot;observers&quot; (Mithaniel Marr and Karana), and the &quot;unfortunate bystanders&quot; (the elemental gods, who block your access to the Plane of Time) are encountered.  The Bertox / Terris Thule / Saryrn sequence doesn't seem to tie in to the main storyline, though -- I still haven't done much of it, so I don't know the lore involved.<br />
<br />
Erollisi and Rodcet don't seem to have much to do with this sequence, though it would have made sense for Rodcet to be involved in the efforts to defeat or at least frustrate Bertox.<br />
<br />
After all, Veeshan, Brell Serillis, Bristlebane, Prexuz, Quellious, and several other dieties and sub-dieties don't make an appearance either.  There has to be something left for PoP 2! &lt; evil grin &gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think they just gave the planes to the gods they could actually make a zone based on.  Really, how could they make the Plane of Love or Plane of Health be PvE zones?  Prexus and Brell Serilis don't have planes in game either.<br />
<br />
One of my main gripes of PoP was how they bastardized a lot of the lore to make it into game content.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much since it was a fairly nice expansion, but there were aspects that just always irked me.  Like how E'ci, Povar and Tarew Marr merged their powers together to summon a giant squid or how Karana was captured by his evil twin and how that really is never explained in the lore.   Also, the Rathe council locked Rallos Zek up after he attacked them, but then they don't seem to mind the fact that he is now free.  The Time scripts is a whole other story...<br />
<br />
Not trying to turn this into a rant, but these are just some example of how the lore that was constructed contradicts the lore that is actually in the game.  I guess I should just be happy that there is lore in the game.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoghnved</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can frequently find Rodcet Nife in Qeynos taking the form of one of the fish in the pond beneath the Temple of Life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sumamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Druzzil Ro shows up in PoP, she part of the script that happens after defeating Quarm. <br />
<br />
Otherwise we might see Brell sooner or later with an expansion or extension who knows ;) <br />
<br />
About Erollisi Marr and Rodcet Nife, well their zones could be similar to Quellious' PoTranquil, non PvE questing zone, hub for travel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty sure Druzzil Ro is, in fact, Solusek Ro's mother :)<br />
<br />
What she saw in Fennin... I'll never know. /shudder. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, Druzzil Ro is Ayonae Ro's mother, so perhaps it's Druzzil and Solusek that were lovers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;After all, Veeshan, Brell Serillis, Bristlebane, Prexuz, Quellious, and several other dieties and sub-dieties don't make an appearance either.

<br />
You can take a tour at BristleLand in PoM :D<br />
<br />
Also I suppose that for Veeshan/Luclin there is complete addon dedicated to them (Velious/SoL), so I dont think they will appear again.<br />
<br />
Btw, there is an huge physical difference between lore Fennin/TZ/VZ and ingame , I completely agree with Lanalia /shiver (Tunare got very old too and Xegony...well she grown very well :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Veeshan shouldn't physically appear, because there would be no way to properly simulate the size of the dragon. Having Veeshan shrink down to battle mortals would be stupid. (Maybe make Veeshan a zone, with the players actually running around inside her?)<br />
<br />
Rodcet Nife and Erollisi Marr shouldn't be fightable, due to their....ummm....what the word? Anyway, due to what their places in the pantheon is, namely being the god of Healing and goddess of Love.<br />
<br />
Or they should be mega-hard to defeat.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine Rodcet Nife being next to impossible to defeat. He should have the most insane regeneration rate out of any mob in the game, and be able to CH more often, too. Maybe AE stuns, too. <br />
<br />
Erollisi Marr I'd imagine would either be untargettable, meaning no one can fight her, or have a ton of AE charms and mezzes. It'd be fun to see a raid where a charm AE goes off and half the raiders start attacking the other half all of a sudden!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Veeshan's eye is in Plane of Sky :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now THAT could be an interesting fight!  Erollisi just stands there.  No attacks, no adds, just a bucketload of HP.  Every six seconds, an unresistable charm to a random person on her aggro list -- who then starts attacking the raiders.  Or something along those lines. =)</div></div><hr />

Or worse...<br />
<br />
I can't find it... but there is a new charm...  horible charm...<br />
<br />
it is a charm...  that in adition to being a charm... ads a proc to the charmed person...  that is the same charm spell so when that charmed person attacks raiders... it can proc the charm on them... who then have the same proc on them who attack other raides  to charm them with the same charm.... you get the idea.<br />
<br />
OUCH!!!<br />
<br />
(wish I could find it again...  but I could not)</div></div><hr />
