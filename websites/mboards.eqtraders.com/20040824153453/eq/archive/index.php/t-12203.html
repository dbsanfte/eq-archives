<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems like SOE has just changed the prices on some Poison Vials.  As of this morning (Nov 19, 2003) I went to the Dark Elf Poison vendors in the PoK  on the Kane Bayle server and found out that my pottery-made sealed poison vials only sell backto the vendors for a mere 2 silver pieces each! (use to be a few plat).  In fact, vendors will only offer you 2 sp for regular, lined and sealed poison vials now.<br />
<br />
Also noticed that you can BUY Sealed Poison Vials off vendors for a mere 1.32 gold pieces!  It use to be around 6pp!  WTH?  If this is a mistake then I suggest all rogues to hurry up and get your make poison skill up as fast as possible.  This will save you big $$!!<br />
<br />
Now it seems that there is no incentive for Rogues to make thier own poison vials - its cheaper just to buy em off the vendors!<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this?</div></div><hr />

Although beneficial for those about to practice the skill, those that have worked to get skill up previous to now with receive the big-sideways-ram stick from SOE.<br />
<br />
&lt;Grabs his money and runs to PoK&gt; :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope this is a bug. :(<br />
<br />
I had heard that maybe there were coming down in price, but this is ludicrous!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mdaisy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think SOE has changed most of the tradeskill buy back prices.  We have seen the same thing in baking, jewelcrafting, pottery, brewing... most of the recipes the use to generate a small profit now do not.  Think it was SOE way of cutting out the macro users from making money and selling on E-Bay type websites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not to mention many recipes that were generating a large loss, now generate a huge loss, Star Ruby Encrusted Steins for example.  Only way you could make a profit on them before was if you farmed the star rubies yourself, then you could turn them into steins, and sell them for more than you paid for ingredients.  Mind you, you'd still be selling them for less than you could have sold the star ruby for to begin with.</div></div><hr />
