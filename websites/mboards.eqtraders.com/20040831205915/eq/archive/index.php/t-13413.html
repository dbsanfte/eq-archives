<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Humlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't see any mention of these as a skillup route in the &quot;learn a skill&quot; area, and I was wondering why.  It seems that they are by far the cheapest way to get to 88, only the mold, 1 water flask, and 1 metal bit.  I'm sure it's somewhat inconvenient to have to go to FG to buy the molds and to another zone for a forge, is there any other reason not to use these to get to 88?  Would you recomend these or another route?  Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
For lockpick, it is entirely about convenience.  Zoning takes long.  FG is 2 zones away from the nearest forge.  Not to mention Echo Cavern is not a safe zone with green aggros.  Molds are not stackable, so the less you have to travel to get them to the forge, the better.<br />
<br />
One close skillup route is Scaler(41)-Dairy Spoon(74)-Fillet Knife(76).  They use the same components, water, metal bits (x 1,2,or 3), and a scaler mold.  All can be done in the same zone (PoK to name one).</div></div><hr />
