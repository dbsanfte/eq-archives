<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerTimy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to Abysmal Sea and Natimbi today and busted out the ole fishing pole.  I noticed that the tuna and crab I caught sold to vendors for a few platinum each, depending on the weight.  So I went to Abysmal to get a good test, and here's what I found out:<br />
<br />
1.  You won't catch fresh fish.  At least I didn't, with a skill of 183.  The only things I caught were tuna and crab of various weight, and the occasional dagger and sandal.<br />
<br />
2.  If you carry a mixing bowl, you can combine one tuna or crab, by itself, and convert it into 1 lb. pieces so that all will stack.  When you sell to vendors, the price evens out exactly as it would if you didn't convert them.<br />
<br />
3.  With 3 stacks of bait, I made 270 platinum.  Not crazy money, but it's significantly better than any LDON runs that I do, and far better than any other fishing spot I've ever heard of.<br />
<br />
If you forage while you fish, I'd recommend going to Natimbi since the stuff you forage there is new and mostly used for tradeskills, whereas in Abysmal the only things you forage are the standard fruit, water, veggies, etc.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

I tested it to see how much I could get in one hour, and walked away with 570pp after abou 55 minutes.<br />

If you spent 6 hours there, then over 3k sounds about right.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Truda Getlow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think they will nerf the fishing per say as the items are of various weights so I believe doing something like a macro to automate fishing would be rather difficult.

<br />
For Natimibi, you have to be pretty high level to fish there safely, from what I've heard. But Abysmal Sea is one big floating city on a boat (Its a Wayfarer base), and its safe for anyone who can get there to fish there. (Not sure if there's anything dangerous in the water, though, so I wouldn't recommend doing any swimming unless you keep close to the boat)<br />
<br />
To get there, you have to go to Nedaria's Landing and head to one of the docks, then wait for the boat to arrive. The boat goes directly to the Abysmal Sea. Its the dock farther away from where you arrive, if you take a Magus to Nedaria's Landing.<br />
<br />
You should be pretty safe in Nedaria's Landing if you go directly from the Magus to the dock. I saw a lvl 20 Berserker in Abysmal Sea, and they were swimming around in the water near where the shuttle docks with the city-boat. (That dock is the prime fishing spot, btw - I'm not sure if there's any otner spot on the boat where you can fish)<br />
<br />
As for maps:<br />
<br />
http://mapfiend.eq-toolbox.com/list_maps.php?PHPSESSID=c52553b8a024b9dedd5d6794fd8ad1df- currently, the cart option isn't working - you either have to download the GoD maps individually, or as a set. Only one of the Abysmal Sea maps has the vendors and trainers marked properly, and I don't know if its the one included in the set, so I recommend downloading and installing it over the map from the set.<br />
<br />
I made about 344pp last night, and got a few skill-ups to boot. (my skill is either 177 or 178 atm - I forgot to take note of which, or I'd edit my profile). The tuna and crab sold for a little over 9pp a stack! I used two Opal Encrusted Steins (one with a +4 or +5 Cha augmentation on it), and had a Cha of 144 when selling. There's a vendor who carries bait and other fishing equipment directly across from the bank - He's marked as a General Supplies vendor.<br />
<br />
I also filled a single Deluxe Tacklebox full of 1lb Tuna and Saltwater Crab and the converted Meat for my Bazaar mule to sell. I plan on fishing some more tonight, selling some of it to vendors and keeping some for my own use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kakg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There most certainly are dangers in the waters under the Queen of Thorns.<br />
<br />
Talking with the NPC's and they say that the fishermen used to lay traps on the sea bed and dive down to clear them but they saw a seamonster and are too afraid to go back into the water. That says two things to me, full fish traps to check out with some chance of nice loot and the possibility of at least one sea monster to fight.<br />
<br />
A mage arrived on the landing stage as I was fishing and he monster summoned on the landing stage to see what was around - up popped a very large sea lizard looking like something from Gallapagos on steroids. Looked superb but I wouldn't want to face it in the water.<br />
<br />
I would strongly advise against swimming in the water unless you are tooled for sea monster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The fish traps are below the boat.  1 under each section from what i've seen so far.  But each time the traps spawn there hasn't been anything in them.  Must be a rare spawn trap to find something in them.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a monster down there yet but doesn't mean there isn't one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Four crab traps and so far all I have found is crab meat or nothing.  No sea monster shows up on tracking or has tried to eat me below the boat and I looked around there for quite some time.  Many of the NPC's in Abysmal are not trackable (and I think every untrackable is a quest giver), but I would think a sea monster would be (the Cragbeast Queen is trackable in Natimbi).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What is the recipe to make the Tuna or Crab meat? What baking skill lvl do I need to combine in a mixing bowl? What are the ingredients.<br />
Also.....I read you can combine your fish in a tackle box to make stacks? How exacty do i do that? If i have 7lb tuna and 3 lb tuna.....if i put in a tackle box will they combine into one stack? Crabs also?<br />
I am new to fishing with a 85 skill lvl....any advice is great. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You make crab meat by &quot;combining&quot; in a mixing bowl (or any of the other fished and foraged meats in GoD so far).  Place a single  X weight something meat in a bowl with nothing else and hit combine and you will wind up with X 1lb something meats (and learned the recipe to convert X weight something meat -so a 10 lb tuna makes 10 piece stack of 1 lb tuna meat).  Now take each of those individually and do the same thing to get something meat without the weight on it and you will be ready for the baking combines (so 1 lb tuna meat is now tuna meat).  I think the conversions take a baking skill of 16.<br />
<br />
Look at the baking recipes on main site and the GoD baking threads for details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>etitameh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">combine any tuna or crab (whatever number of lbs it is) alone in a mixing bowl to get that number of 1lb pieces. example: 7lb saltwater tuna in mixing bowl --&gt; 7 x 1lb saltwater tuna. all 1lb tuna stacks together, all 1lb crab stacks together.<br />

i believe this also works for the foraged/dropped hynid and cragbeast meats, but i haven't gotten my hands on either of those. ;)</div></div><hr />

If you go into the serwers instanced adventure thingys, theres a 'rotting satchel' i think, its a rare random drop. Hand it to the dorf and he hands you a craptacular no-drop range see-invis item that, if you are of any level to enter the instanced dungeons, youll just drop the item on your destroy button, its SO not worth it.<br />

There is often a crowd at the mage port in with a number of jokers who forget to move out of the way as soon as they arrive resulting jumble of limbs as everyone arrives at same point.<br />

In addition on Stromm we suffer from the usual abusive Mages who think it is funny to cast &quot;Rod of Mystical Transvergence&quot; to LD people. The extra graphics load and large knot of people at the zone in point for Natimbi make it the favourite spot for this disgusting behaviour after the bazaar. I had one episode where it took me three LD's to escape the natimbi zone-in point because of some jerk who cast it continuously.<br />

I really wish that spell would be nerfed big time - i'm sick of returning to my trader to find another rod on my cursor because some jerk of a mage couldn't wait for a trader slot and tried to LD the other players in my area.</div></div><hr />

I've had no problems just sitting in the camp afk for hours at a time.  But if you want a safer spot, when facing the river, follow the shore left and just stay along that till you hit the zone wall, it's pretty safe there, since it would be really hard to train.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're probably right.  I fished there for several hours and didn't catch a single shoe or dagger - the only thing I caught that wasn't a tuna or crab was a no drop key, and only got one of those.  It's been a couple weeks since I've fished there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Fishing never turned a huge profit in the past.<br />
Fishing in Abysmal Sea gave a decent profit considering the hours you had to put in.<br />
By nerfing it Sony is basically saying that Fishing is considered TRASH in their eyes. Big deal.....we made some Plat from our Fishing, what was the big deal!!!<br />
Think about it......the Mod Baits and Flies still DO NOT work. Keep a regular fishing pole in your primary...put a catch-a-lot bait in your inventory, bag or ammo slot. You will see there is no change in skill on your UI. Sony just does not care about Fishing at all.<br />
Sony gives plenty of recipes for Flies that give +4% Mod......but in reality they dont work. Turns out they never worked but the scam was uncovered when the new UI came out.<br />
Sorry if I sound harsh but I love fishing.<br />
The way Sony treats fishing, they should just pull the skill out of the game at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Fishing is still quite profitable for me and would still be even if they nerf the GoD fishing. Saying that reducing the GoD fishing in any way makes the skill trash is just silly, and the fishing bait isn't exactly news to me, just confirmation of what looked to be logical considering no other items seem to give stats while in ammo slot. I hate those stupid sandals and those pointless daggers as much as the next person, but I see why they will probably reduce vendor buy prices on the fish in the future to go along with the potion change. Personally I'd prefer it if we never got the sandals and daggers at 200 skill, or if they were taken out of the fishing table in most zones. All they do is add the extra step in tracking them down and destroying them.<br />
<br />
If they don't want people to sit in perfect safety making combines that will sell for a significant profit to NPCs what makes you think they'll want people to be able to sit in perfect safety (Abysmal Sea) fishing to sell for a significant profit to NPCs? Know what was the first thing I thought when I saw the sellbacks I got offered for my tuna and troll potions? &quot;Oh god, this is sooo going to be the new macro thing until they make these unsellable&quot;. And yes, I have seen some fishing macros that were very impressive in sophistication and some people who were probably using them in GoD. So please consider that before getting up in arms about fishing being so nerfed - cuz chances are this is in for a biiiig reduction in the future.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I agree, now that it's pretty obvious to everyone that they are quite pointless they should fix them. Or find another use for them other than +%. Since mods never stack and I always use my Brell's fishing pole the bait has always been pretty useless to me. I guess the solution to fishing bait would be to either recode the ammo slot to give stats (which they might chose not to do for balance reasons unrelated to fishing), move bait to be used from range slot, or find some new use for bait we haven't thought of. Maybe gunthak them, so you could combine one +% storebought or made lure in tool box for several standard baits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, AS I think will end up being a pretty decent ghost town.<br />
<br />
For now it's populated due to a few things.  First and foremost the fishermen(women).<br />
<br />
Next we have the tradeskillers there<br />
<br />
Lastly we have the quest folks.<br />
<br />
Once fishing gets nerfed its down to the tradeskillers.  Once the tradeskillers learn to work the materials they're gone.  <br />
<br />
That leaves the questers who'll pop in, do the quest and leave.  Making AS a ghost town.<br />
<br />
The way I look at it is, I can put in an hour and make 700pp (at 180 skill).  Or I can spend an hour actually XP'ing and earn drops that'll net me much more than that.  I think fishing in AS is a decent way to earn plat, but it requires time - does the timesink offset the reward though?  I don't think they need to nerf it to the point where the 15lb tuna/crabs are worth gold or copper, but if they went and cut prices back some I think it'd be reasonable (considering it is sadly easy to macro fishing - sometimes I wish I didn't have a conscience - and a fear of being banned).  In true SoE fashion tho, me thinks that an hour in AS will soon net about 10gp total.</div></div><hr />

If it were a little easier to get to this zone, say a magus or direct ports into AS (instead of Natimbi then waiting for a boat), it might be a lot more successful.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I know someone said that they were breaking down the fish to 1 pounders in a mixing bowl and they were selling for their equivalent in weight thus a 15 pounder would sell for 15 copper by the new pricing. Now that's a major nerf. *sigh there goes my lil moneymaker. There's a patch scheduled for tomorrow (10th).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>binkyvamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Well it's always too good to be true when it comes to EverQuest..<br />
<br />
It's my impression that fishing was created the way it was so that it could feed tribute. FT5 tribute buff needs 222 tribute per hour, so an hour of relaxing fishing/socialising could get you anywhere upto around 2-4 hours of FT5 or some other buff. You can still hand in the fish for their pp equivalent (actually slightly more - 15lb sells for 7pp 1gp 4sp 3cp, but donates for 8 tribute) to the tribute masters.<br />
<br />
But once again, it's all part of SOE's devious plan to get you to buy GoD. Unless you're quite uber or a semi-uber caster, there's not really many other reasons to buy GoD apart from tribute and fishing. Fishing's lost its flexibility now that you can't get either pp OR tribute, only tribute. There's always at least a couple of small things in every expansion that will appeal to different people (bigger bank, a couple of nodrop spells, teleport books, etc, which are all ridiculously easy to put into the game yet a lot of people pay big money for it and hardly even visit/see the new zones/content). This little GoD sweetener has now been nerfed so i'm not too happy about that (nor is my wife), since i likely won't be coming back to GoD ever, and there's $29.99 down the drain. Oh, wait, that's right, $29.99 (on top of the monthly fee) for tribute buffs which should've really been free and i know is very trivial to add to the game. Hmm. I'm sure there's a lot of unhappy people out there.<br />
<br />
But, maybe not? I haven't been to Abysmal Sea, but Natimbi has only 2-10 people fishing at any one time, out of what, a server population of 3000 or so? I hardly see any reason to nerf it. Especially since it's not macroable due to overloading yourself with shoes/daggers, breaking fishing poles, and in Natimbi anyway, the constant threat of morons training mobs all over the place. Perhaps they should've just nerfed Abysmal Sea fishing. This is nothing like necessary nerfs such as the macro fletching problem (which took months and many /petitions to finally see nerfed).. Nothing even close. A rough calculation: 1-15lb catches (6-15 at fishing 200, but you've got spilt beer, shoes, daggers to account for), 7.5lb average, sells for 3.5pp, fish every 12 seconds. That's about 1kpp an hour max (which i am 99% positive they calculated while designing the fishing drops). 1k an hour? Big deal.. It was my understanding that people were getting 10's of k every hour with fletching. 1k per hour (when really people seem to be getting 300-700pp) is quite reasonable and fair. Relaxing too. And a chance to actually talk to other people.<br />
<br />
It's quite easy to get much more money than fishing can ever offer AND experience, by just going out there and killing stuff. Or we can just go and farm green mobs for pp and screw up the game for people trying to get actual experience, as opposed to the game economy which is NOT affected by the profitable fishing.<br />
<br />
I had hoped maybe that SOE realised there's more to real life and game life nowadays, than just killing things to get money. It's a growing trend that people want to be able to earn money and experience by doing things other than just killing in games (and of course, in real life, only a very very small messed up minority of evil good-for-nothings kill for money - the rest earn it through decent means).<br />
<br />
I'm sure all the parents out there will be troubled by this nerf. Your children are now off to earn money almost exclusively (again) by spending their time brutally killing things, not by doing something constructive and peacefully rewarding like fishing. Are you happy with that?<br />
<br />
SOE are going to look very stupid if they use the standard excuse, &quot;it was never intended to be like that&quot;. Or perhaps they'll claim that it wasn't forseseeable that people would abuse their little GoD sweetener (*cough*). Or should that be that a very small minority of the game population would buy an expansion to do something seemingly &quot;legal&quot; and present in the game past other nerfs, fish for much less pp than they can get killing, not ruin the game economy, and do something peaceful and social? There's simply no excuse for nerfing this, really. They also could foresee whatever's happening that's causing the nerf, as they had to go and plan 4 sets of meat/catches, their drop tables, their price, and their recipies - all without realising after months of development and testing, a full month (? i forgot when GoD came out) of live gameplay and numerous patches, that it would possibly pose a threat to the game economy? Which, i might add, has not threatened nor affected.<br />
<br />
At least they could double the tribute value of fish/crabs, or something, if they're going to persist with this illogical nerf. It might make more people feel that tribute buffs are easier to obtain and give some worth back into fishing. And you know what that means SOE? More people buying GoD, and more money. I know how much you love money.<br />
<br />
Sigh.. What am i wasting my time for anyway, as if SOE cares about us or our opinions. You'd think that considering we put a roof over their head and food on their tables, that they'd want to please and reward us just a little bit more. Also considering that it's a game, and games are meant to be fun and rewarding... As opposed to hard work, which EverQuest is not unlike sometimes, and which most of us do every day and wish to get away from by playing a nice, relaxing, and rewarding game.<br />

Actually there is a macro out there, that if you use with &quot;fisherman's companion&quot; it will buy your bait, fish with it, summon a new pole when yours breaks, sell your fish, and bank your money all to start the cycle over and over again.

Well that's just thoroughly annoying and disappointing. Once again, the cheating minority have ruined it for the honest majority. Who the hell would design and release something like that? You'd think somebody who could make something like that, would also have the brains and insight to realise that releasing it would get it nerfed and ruined for everyone. SOE should catch the people using that instead of taking the easy way out and punishing everyone. That's just ridiculous.<br />

Oh come on. Fishing can be maxed at, what level 39? So you don't see anthing wrong with a level 40 character being able to farm plat at a rate of 3k a day, or whatever the rate was? I think you could make like 500 plat an hour or something at 200 skill... at absolutely no risk to yourself. <br />
<br />
I mean if they put that in, why not just make all sorts of ways you can make 1-3k a day, just sitting in a city? That way anybody can make a level 1 toon and be ueber equipped before they ever leave the safe city gates.<br />
<br />
I mean, I can see the appeal of such a thing, I guess, but I don't think that's the game SOE wants to make.</div></div><hr />

Just think about it for a minute.<br />
<br />
In order for such a macro to work it would have to move your character around between a merchant, banker and the fishing spot. How likely is it that a macro has been built that can do all those things? How much more likely is it that you will glitch and walk into the water and drown?<br />
<br />
I'm absolutely certain that all of the fishermen who fished near me were running perfectly legally. I know because on the landing platform on Stromm we all had a great laugh chatting and taking the mickey out of each other. Last night was the best so far since the platform was packed solid with everyone getting in some last minute catches before the patch went in. I'm going to miss the company as normally fishing is a pretty lonely skill while since GoD it's been very popular and I've been able to squeeze in a lot of extras like language training at the same time i'm fishing.</div></div><hr />

I could make 1200 an hour at 200 skill, but how is that any different than me making that much farming cats in stonebrunt and spiderlings in Feerrott?  At 30pp per padding in the bazaar, I can easily farm enough stuff in an hour to make 2 stacks of padding, and that's at no risk to my 55 Paladin.<br />
<br />
Fishing isn't the mature cheese exploit or another similar circumstance.  You actually need a decent fishing skill to make the real money, and the patience to do so.  I hope it is still somewhat profitable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Certainly, a level 1 could go and fish, bank platinum, and equip his/her character/ buy spells etc.  And I say...good for them.  They worked for it.  If someone wants to put the hours into fishing (and it would take many hours to obtain &quot;uber&quot; gear) then I feel that yes--they should get something out of it.<br />
<br />
SOE could have reduced the prices so the profit was not quite as big if, looking things over, they felt there was too much of an imbalance.  But no--they nerf the prices so much so that it is utterly useless now to fish.  Another example of players getting nothing valuable back for their time.<br />
<br />
I feel SOE needs to be held accountable for a mistake like this.  They have had plenty of time since the release of GoD to change the prices, or at the very least, to announce to players that a change was forthcoming.  We did not even receive an apology for the &quot;error.&quot;  Of course not.  They don't want to say anything about it.<br />

1.  Elimiate all money from the game.<br />
2.  Eliminate all vendor NPCs.<br />
3. Make all required items for tradeskills available as drops/forage in all zones.<br />
4. Make all weapons, armor, clothing, etc, that are not needed for tradeskills - no drop.<br />
5. Make all spells researched based on your level and items found while playing or have to learn them from the guild masters.<br />
<br />
This eliminates all nerfs required to &quot;fix&quot; money making activities.<br />
Makes Tradeskills required as the only way to get items would be to make/trade for them.<br />
Helps the trades people become more useful in the game and at the same time reduces the numbers of tradespeople do to the hassle of getting the raw materials required to skill up.<br />
<br />
Imagine the fun that we could have as trades people when our items are in demand just to play the game, like food, arrows, bows, weapons, armor etc.<br />

It may not be likely but they DO exist. I've read the code for some of them out of curiosity's sake (graduated programmer, I enjoy reading code) and these are very very sophisticated macros. I mean I was shocked at how many things they were factoring in to it. They really can do all that and more. You're talking about macros with triggers for many many contingencies so the bot can stay up macroing without being stopped by some little inconvenience or lag.<br />
<br />
Believe me, these things are real and there are people who were taking advantage of this. In fact in some ways this was even better for them than their previous tricks since in this case they didn't have to compensate for people leaving items in trade containers to throw the macroers off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>uncleshmoozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I'm not so much upset about this change as I am puzzled about the unseen process by which it came about.  What I mean by that is this -- the expansion was created in its various details by the prgrammers and approved to go live by the management   At some point in that process somebody had the idea that they should have a wide variety of sizes of fish, crabs and meats of various sorts that could be fished, foraged or aquired in various other ways and this was approved to go live.  Various drop tables, fishing tables and foraging tables were created and these were approved to go live.  And merchant pricing tables for all these various things were created and these were also approved to go live.<br />
<br />
Included in this process were a variety of testing stages including a beta test stage which evidently involved a fairly large number of players, and it seems likely that at least a few people would have taken time to check out the fishing tables and such to conform that those were working as intended.<br />
<br />
With all that being true, it seems to me that the rate at which fish could be gathered would have been known.and it wouldn't have been too tricky for somebody with access to that information and access to the merchant pricing tables to at least get some sense of the amount of money a person could make by fishing in the new expansion.<br />
<br />
So it went through all these various stages of approval and testing and it clearly appeared that the intent was that players who spent some time working on their fishing skill could make several thousand plat a day by fishing in the Asbysmal Sea and Natimbi.  But now we see that somebody at Sony has taken another look at this, and decided that this was a mistake and that an adjustment to the merchant pricing was needed.  Now this isn't really all that surprising in and of itself.  It's certainly not outside of the normal operation of the game for Sony to fine tune things a bit here and there to make them work better in the context of the overall game.  The thing that I find surprising is the magnitude of the adjustment.  From the reports I am reading it appears that the new prices being paid are about 1/500 of the original prices.<br />
<br />
That, folks, is a gigantic change.  I indicates that somebody at Sony looked at this situation and decided that all those previous approvals were grossly in error.  And that, folks, apparently means that somebody in the higher levels of management at Sony involved with this game has a serious and fundamentally different view of the way the game ought to work than the lower levels of management who approved all those original tables to go live in the first place.<br />
<br />
Now think about this for a minute.  This  particular change in the game was one that they made note of in the patch message with these words:<br />
<br />
The sell prices for Saltwater Tuna and Saltwater crab, as well as the price for any item made from them, have been reduced.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Reduced?&quot;  How about &quot;virtually eliminated?&quot;  That's closer to the truth here.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
That gross bit of understatement is there to indicate a change which they certainly knew would be noticed, and it's apparently there more to confirm for the players that the change was, indeed, intended so that the GMs and customer service staff would not be bogged down by questions about it.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Now, think about this fact.  Various things in the game are &quot;fine tuned&quot; in pretty much every patch.  In all likelihood most of them are less radical than this one by a wide margin.  The fact that a change as extreme as this one only merits a short, understated comment in the patch message seems to suggest that it takes a pretty darn big change to merit any comment at all.<br />
<br />
That's something to keep in mind when we play the game.<br />

Frankly,  this is an adult game. There's lot's of stuff that would bother some parents in this game, and really killing things to get money is probably the least of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Firstly, EverQuest is rated T for teens 13y/o and over - not even M which a lot of parent-troubling games are rated. And i frequently see people who are that young or younger. EverQuest an adult game? I think not. Obviously you are also not a parent, or at least one that actively cares and checks what your child is playing. Nor have you seen the demographics shown in studies conducted by Nick Yee, which clearly show that EverQuest is a game of all ages.<br />
<br />
Secondly, yes there is a lot of stuff that would bother parents in this game, and the elimination of a non-violent money-maker would bother them as well. Many many parents, children, and adults alike are all wanting peaceful or alternative ways to make money or gain experience (all MMORPGs are heading this way). GoD introduced a great one - fishing! But it's just been nerfed. So there's the disappointment/concern. Thanks for backing me up there. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh come on. Fishing can be maxed at, what level 39? So you don't see anthing wrong with a level 40 character being able to farm plat at a rate of 3k a day, or whatever the rate was? I think you could make like 500 plat an hour or something at 200 skill... at absolutely no risk to yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Come on? I don't see anything wrong etc? No, you come on. Read entire posts before replying to them thanks, it's polite. If you don't, then you lose context and start all sorts of irrelevant nonsense. As i said in my last post &quot;I haven't been to Abysmal Sea&quot;, and &quot;and in Natimbi anyway, the constant threat of morons training mobs all over the place. Perhaps they should've just nerfed Abysmal Sea fishing.&quot;. So yes what i said still stands. Nerf Abysmal Sea fishing tables, keep Natimbi - it's dangerous.<br />
<br />
Also, it's upto around 24k a day, and 1k an hour - not 3k a day.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's actually not so bad for newbies to be earning upto 1k an hour anyway. Haven't you noticed the trend in expansions? Each expansion makes us more powerful by giving us more levels, more spells, more stats, more buffs, more AA, more more more... pp? Sure, why not. That's a big reason why we keep buying new expansions, for more chances to become more powerful.<br />
<br />
You can still make much more pp if you're higher level farming greens or just xp'ing. As long as people aren't using macros, then i can't see the problem. I think it's great for everyone to be able to make money by peacefully fishing and socialising, instead of just killing things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
Let's all not forget the tribute. Fishing goes hand in hand with tribute, and i'll be extremely disappointed if they nerf the tribute too. Nerfing the pp only fixes half of the problem. First, innocent people are now disadvantaged becuase of macroing bastards. Second, people can still macro for fish to sell for tribute, which isn't so bad because it doesn't affect the economy or other people - it just makes the macroer more powerful. They should really just catch the people macroing, or make EverQuest macro-proof, and everything will be fine.<br />
<br />
As it was already stated in this thread, and as i have mentioned myself earlier, the drop tables and prices have gone through a lot of development, testing, and a month of live playing. There is NO way in hell that it wasn't intended for level 39's to make upto 1k per hour. They designed it like that, it was implemented like that, it was tested like that, and it was played like that for a month. So for illovich and your: &quot;So you don't see anthing wrong with a level 40 character being able to farm plat at a rate of 3k a day, or whatever the rate was?&quot;. No, i don't see a problem with that, and lots of other people don't either, including SOE. One can only logically assume that it was nerfed because of the risk-free macroing - which is the easy, lazy way out and creates problems and doesn't solve others. Or, as uncleshmoozo has mentioned, there are serious conflicts, mismanagement, or communication problems within SOE.<br />

I feel absolutely no regret at doing this.  I automated a process a heavy book and one of those stupid glass drinking birds could have done.  Where's the fun in playing a game where you hit 2 buttons for hours at a time?  But what can you expect from a game that was originally designed to be pay per hour.  <br />
<br />
I got a lot of books reading and quite a bit of Phantasy Star Online 3 in, because you really do have to watch -- otherwise, your poll will break a few few baits in, and leave you with a royal pain.  Oh, and there were a few idiots trying to train / kite mobs, but there's a spot in the corner of Natimbi that's completely safe since the mobs can't get to it.<br />
<br />
They *obviously* inteded GoD fishing to be used for money.  Why?  The put a fishing salesman right next to the ocean.  I'd feel worse about it if I had to zone or something to get more bait and sell, but I didn't.  It was right there, and not only that, when you hail him, he tells you to fish. :P<br />

So yah.  They pulled the ol Bait and Switch to get people to buy GoD, and it's rather funny in a sick sorta way.  About as ethical as what they pulled with the Lords of Everquest popup, but since it didn't upset nearly as many people, it kinda went unnoticed.<br />
<br />
The fish are still useful for Tribute?  Nice to know.  I have about 30 stacks of tuna and crab meat, I was just gonna use it to train baking and make stat food, but hey, whatever works.  I might stop by and fish for a few &quot;thousand pp&quot; worth of fish.  I wouldn't mind 200 hours of SOW, or something like that. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">There really is no reason why fish in such an area should not sell to npcs for as much as they did. I can't figure out the reason for making a tradeskill you have to raise pretty high, not pay off with npc sales. <br />
<br />
It is a time consuming way to make money which you'd only be doing if you wanted to fish. The &quot;you can bot though!&quot;, arguement really doesn't wash since 99 percent of the playerbase is never going to &quot;bot&quot; (I would not even know how to do it.)<br />
<br />
One thing I like about tradeskills in FFXI is that the better fish you get the more they sell for to an npc. If you catch a good fish it sells to an npc for up to several hundred gil or more.<br />
<br />
A simple way to fix it, if they were concerned about botting, would be like FFXI Also does and make the fish that sell for more non-stackable. Your inventory would fill up quite fast on fish that don't stack, while I'd be surprised if someone had a bot program that would also go off to an npc and sell fish.<br />
<br />
Interesting real life tidbit:<br />
<br />
I was just watching some thing on the travel channel or food network or something which was talking about how much tuna sold for from a fish market. I was surprised at them talking about hundreds of dollars for so many pounds, until they said that the entire fish was caught the other day and sold to the market for $10,000. Tunas are darn big too, I'm pretty sure you could never catch one standing around with a fishing pole.. ahah.</div></div><hr />

I discovered today you can't turn in Crab or Tuna Meat, even in stacks of 20.  I didn't have time  to go back and try and fish a 15 pounder.<br />
<br />
It might just be because they're not worth a full plat any longer.</div></div><hr />

So the meat sold for more?  Wish I had known that. :(  I tried breaking the fish down to 1 pounders but didn't make any more money, by the time I knew about the meat thing I had put the bowl away.  :/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Ok, I don't want to discuss macros here, but one thing did stick and that was the question of &quot;Why should the possibility that something can be macroed have any bearing?&quot;. It wasn't worded quite that way but that was as far as I can tell the intent.<br />
<br />
The reason for that is simple, if something can be easily macroed then the macroer gains an unfair advantage over someone who's playing normally without them. If left unchecked the macroer's financial status can become the norm, example would be the way prices went way up with recent macro explosion and plat duped money. A legit player can't compete with a bot that may be left on for 5 times the play time, all of that time making money. That is, in a macro friendly game eventually to remain competitive you need to macro. Yes, this is something I have seen in games that have allowed unchecked macroing, the entrance curve becomes so steep that you are required to macro if you want to progress. Especially so in games with heavy economies and a great deal of tradable products to help players.<br />
<br />
I've got no beef with the people who sit at their screen with a gamepad or proggy - some of the game has horrible implementation that way, like rangers and bards. Try having a bard friend who has arthritis and tell me EQ does bard support well. But the guy who puts his macro bots on to work before he goes to sleep and then checks to see how many thousands he's made when he gets home from work the next day - that's not so good. That money isn't going to go away, and if you get enough dedicated macroers who know they can get away with it scott-free they can affect your play as the essentially free platinum drives up prices. With the bazaar at least you are limited by what the players want. The other players in the multiplayer game are your limit to how much you can make in the bazaar. There's no PC who'll pay unlimited amounts of plat at a profit to you for the same thing every single day forever without you running any risk.<br />
<br />
To be fair I should say I think some of the macroing problems stem from boring gaming components. No one likes to sit at their computer hitting the forage button every time it pops up. It's daft, it's boring, and of course people will come up with some way to automate the eating of the veggies while they work so they can get to their dessert when they get home and want to have fun. I also think competition, time sinks, greed, player need for artificial status structure, and the price of upgrading play a part in having people turn to the macro side of the force, but my thoughts on that would take a longer time to explain than can be done here.<br />
<br />
Oh and 1 cp? Wow, and my friends accuse me of overkill. If this were dateing I'd say &quot;Way to rebound&quot;. I mean yes, the prices were way way too high but... well at least we're not overreacting by moving to the other extreme. Doesn't affect me since I make my plat the old fashioned way of overpricing my bazaar wares but it does make me laugh every time something is taken to the other extreme after one of these SNAFUs. That was not intended as a flame against SOE btw. More of dry sardonic comment on the normal reaction, it's always struck me as funny in the past and still continues to do amuse. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>binkyvamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">1 and 2lb. tuna/crabs have never had a tribute value anyway - just look at lucy. This is to stop people from increasing the value by chopping it down. The pp worth was lb x 0.4762, and thus is not affected by moving from 15lb to 1lb - you end up with exactly the same pp. The tribute was half of the lbs rounded up however, and is an integer unlike, for example, 15lb selling for 7.143pp.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
8lb. = 8 / 2 = 4 tribute.<br />
7lb. = 7 / 2 = 3.5 rounded up to 4 tribute.<br />
<br />
If you broke them down to 1lb, and could donate 1lb:<br />
1lb. = 1 / 2 = 0.5 rounded up to 1 tribute (lowest integer possible)<br />
8 x 1lb. = 8 tribute. Double what you would have got if you just handed in the 8lb by itself.<br />
<br />
This further proves that the sale/donate price of crab/tuna was planned carefully, and wasn't just a mistake or oversight left in the game that had to be corrected (*cough* nerfed) to &quot;the way it was intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's still my impression that tuna/crab etc were created to supplement tribute, since it was released in the same expansion, is one of the very few stackable/fishable items that will donate for tribute, and it just makes perfect sense that you can sit around, relax, chat, wait for friends etc, whilst preparing for your tribute-buffed adventuring later.<br />
<br />
If they remove the fishing tribute values, then there's no other reason to spend $29.99 other than to be able to click the tribute master - which is quite a gyp. Unless of course you can handle green level 4x's mobs that hit you for ~250dmg (or 1200-2000dmg in expeditions and so on), and/or you're insane and just want to play a ridiculously hard expansion for relatively little reward (which has been and will continue to be nerfed), and/or you're in an uberly uber group or guild and feel that PoP isn't enough.<br />

They will cause the end of their game soon enough.Just look at their history, they nerfed the Hermit in South Karana and folks stopped campin him anyway, they nerfed Rubicite years ago, manastone years ago, Circlet of Shadow years ago......so they started nerfs back then. They just dont like happy players.</div></div><hr />
