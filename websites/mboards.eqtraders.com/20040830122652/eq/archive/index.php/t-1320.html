<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gukta newbie zone has AMAZING NUMBERS of spiderlings. If you need the silks, go there. Theres plenty. I think the days of paying 3-5p ea is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Delfontes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ruala in Innotule Swamp newbie zone seems to be restocking spiderling silk....<br />
<br />
Does this mean spiderling silk is gonna be worthless, or that hundreds of newbie frogs are selling to her?<br />
<br />
So far I am at about 600 silks... and way running out of room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every 20 minutes or so I rebuy her out and get 1-2 stacks.<br />
<br />
Wondering if I should stop buying, hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Delfontes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How did this get in Tinkering?<br />
<br />
This was supposed to be a tailoring thing...<br />
<br />
And it appears he definately wasn't stocking himself, it was the hundred tadpoles....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stu Pidiot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">also unrelated to tinkering but there are a ton of zombie skins to be had from the vendors too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arishia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never understood why spiderling silk was so high in cost.  Even before LOY, you could easily farm them in The Feerrott.  I had about 10 stacks in an hour and a half or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spiderling silks make threads..<br />
<br />
threads make leather padding<br />
<br />
leather padding makes fine plate<br />
<br />
fine plate makes clockwork watchman<br />
<br />
watchman makes observer and shadowwalker<br />
<br />
I think thats why someone posted this in tinkering boards.. they were probably making clockwork and needed silks.</div></div><hr />
