<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foxxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a market for +% fishing bait? They all require a silk thread which is 2 spiderling silk. Spiderling silk sells for about 4pp on my server so to make it worthwhile you would have to sell for at least 8pp. I’m very doubtful folk would pay this much. I’ve not seen any +% bait for sale in he Bazaar.<br />
Not sure though how you would search for bait in the Bazaar? I’ve assumed they’re under Misc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless the % modifier is huge on the player-made bait, I don't think there'd be a market for it.  You can buy +3% bait in Shadowhaven for about 2gp each and +2% bait in PoK for less than 1gp, I think.  The forgaged bait from Gunthak has +5% and when it's sold to a vendor, players can buy it back for about 1.5pp.<br />
<br />
There's also the unsolved question of whether modifiers on bait and poles stack.  You can buy a +2% pole in Shadowhaven, and players can make pole with +5%, I believe.  If that doesn't stack with bait, then you may as well use the cheapest bait you can find.  Again, we have no evidence (that I know of) one way or the other on this issue.<br />
<br />
Given that the baits require 8pp worth of silk, I seriously doubt you'll find anyone willing to pay 160pp for a stack of bait unless it has, like, +100% modifier or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foxxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is a pity, all the rather large number of Tackle box combines to make bait are redundant. Lets hope the EQ team put this to rights sometime. As you say, push the skill mod way up or use less expensive components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>caena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spiderling silks are only expensive in the bazaar.  That's not the EQ team's fault, really.<br />
<br />
Try vendor mining for them, or just go smoosh spiderlings yourself.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KyrosKrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unfortunately, you'd face the same problem. <br />
<br />
Say you go out and smoosh some spiderling.  You get two silks out of it.<br />
<br />
You can sell those silks as-is and pretty quickly for 8pp total.<br />
<br />
Or, you can make them into a +x% bait and sell it for  ... 2gp?  1pp max?  In three months, when some bored fisherman actually searches the bazaar for bait?<br />
<br />
If the goal is to make money, there's no comparison.  If the goal is to get a better bait, then by all means go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foxxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No it isn't EQ teams fault, it would be difficult to forsee this situation. I could still make a few lures for fun but I'm loath to use up my spiderling silks this way. I sure do farm them myself as my main is only a 27th Necro. <br />
If some kind person from EQ happens to see this post they might deem to give us some silkthreadless lure combines.  I'm a professional software developer, I'd do it for them for free if they give me unrestricted access to the EQ source code, database and configuration files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Merle ApAmber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I suppose it gets down to being able to (occasionally) catch fish you just can't catch with the standard fair.  So far no one has established a precedence for this.  Loot table hasn't been wildcard augmented yet.  Tho...LDoN adds the foundations if applied to other zones.  Trade products made with the &quot;new&quot; fish would then have the ability to produce a better return on investment as compared to simple silk sales for tailors leveling up.<br />

(interesting wain hope there for code access) :D :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
