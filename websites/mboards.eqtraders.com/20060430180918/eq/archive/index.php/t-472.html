<br />
Skill 229 (+5%)<br />
255str/255 wis<br />
Straight out of the mean streets of ogguk!<br />
<br />
Blackended Darkscale Bracer 1/3<br />
Blackened Darkscale Vambraces 1/1 (woohoo!)<br />
Blackened Darkscale Pauldron 1/8 (doh!)<br />
Blackened Darkscale Boots (0/2)<br />
<br />
Failed on 3 of the sheets of ogguk adamantate. But hey, its only trivial by a billion points, so I should expect that huh? &gt;:(<br />
<br />
so 3/15, or roughly 20%.  Any idea what a smith of this skill level (roughly 240) runs normally?<br />
<br />
Also, I have always had horrible luck on pauldrons. Back from my banded days, and especially noticable in fine steel. Normally dont make em. I think its some kind of curse from my own shoulders for leaving a bloodstained mantle on em for 47 levels...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balthozzar</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kept track of my combines when I first started BD cultural at 230 +5% skill, up until I hit 234 skill and took a bit of a break. I made a total of 91 combines, for 39 successes. (42%) Seems like you just had a bad streak there with shoulders. I was 3 for 6 during that time on those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, in my recent runs I've had the following results.<br />
<br />
Edit: This is with a character with 250 raw skill and the Grandmasters Smithy Hammer, max INT, etc.<br />
<br />
Bad day<br />
<br />
3/7 Heraldic Bracers (various imbues)<br />
0/4 Heraldic Boots<br />
<br />
That is about the time I gave up and let my hammer melt in the forge.<br />
<br />
On a more recent set...<br />
<br />
2/3 on Fierce Heraldic Bracers<br />
1/2 on Fierce Heraldic Visor<br />
1/1 on Fierce Heraldic Gorget<br />
1/1 on Fierce Heraldic BP<br />
1/2 on Fierce Heraldic Pauldrons<br />
0/2 on Fierce Heraldic Vambraces<br />
1/1 on Unimbued Heraldic Bracer<br />
<br />
I was quite pleased after that run to say the least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold2</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This stuff is tough. I'd say I'm about 40% overall on at least 100 combines.<br />
Last session: 0/3 on artficer's bracers. Session before that : 0/3 on artificer's bracers, 1/2 artificers greeves, 1/1 artificer's arms, 1/2 Helanic tundra helm, 1/2 helanic tundra belt, 1/2 helanic neck, 1/1 helanic face mask., or something like that. The 1 ring combines can be very tough. For some reason I've always done worse on the shaman armor than on the warrior armor. I'm 250 skill + geerlok.<br />
They claim that you lose 1% success rate per skill level . So if I'm at 252 (cap) and do 40%, you'd average 28% success at effective 240.<br />
At 240 you might want to power level with sickles because I'll bet you'd break even or even make money and you can get to 250 if you do a couple hundred sickles.<br />
I can't stand doing sickles anymore but I went from 242 to 250 on em.</div></div><hr />

It was closer to 44%, but my last hundred combines or so were so poor my overall success rate dropped a couple of % points.<br />
<br />
RNG has been terrible lately, very streaky, even compared to before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold2</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">last run :<br />

0/3 artificers bracers<br />
2/2 artificers bracers<br />
1/4 artificers belt (success on last one)<br />
250 skill plus geerlok<br />
Very streaky but not a bad session</div></div><hr />

<br />
Run 1 - 2 for 9:<br />
1/3 Fetid Heraldic (Bertoxxulus) Breastplate<br />
1/3 Fetid Heraldic (Bertoxxulus) Boots<br />
0/3 Fetid Heraldic (Bertoxxulus) Bracers<br />
For a guildie - not such a good run<br />
<br />
Run 2 - 2 for 2:<br />
2/2 Fine Heraldic (unimbued) Bracers<br />
For a guildie - a good run<br />
<br />
Run 3 - 3 for 3<br />
1/1 Fierce Heraldic (Rallos Zek) BP<br />
1/1 Fierce Heraldic (Rallos Zek) Greaves<br />
1/1 Fierce Heraldic (Rallos Zek) Boots<br />
(And a very happy guildie - good because I failed 2 BDs in the kiln/brew barrel for him just a few days before)<br />
<br />
Run 4-  1 for 2<br />
1/2 Luminant (Mith Marr) Heraldic BP<br />
To replace my own, which I sold<br />
<br />
Run 5 - 3 for 3:  <br />
1/1 Fierce Heraldic (Rallos Zek) BP<br />
1/1 Fierce Heraldic (Rallos Zek) Greaves<br />
1/1 Fierce Heraldic (Rallos Zek) Boots<br />
And a very happy Troll cusomer<br />
<br />
Among those I have had an inordinate amount of failures on trivial combines on BDs (failures in kiln, brew barrel and forge), but the final combines have generally been good. Success rate looks to be about 50/50 (though I've been real lucky in the last series of runs, as you can see).<br />
