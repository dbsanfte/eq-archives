<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kimalaca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a set of directions on how to master pottery in in 30 pp or less available here.  But i have yet to make it work.  My bard with the intelligence of 80 first trained the skill to 20 and then purchased the materials, i used 100 med jar sketches when 50 sketches should get you to the trivial in the thirtys.  By the time i was done making the jars my skill was only 28, only about half way there.<br />
<br />
Does this mastery technique work, as my rogue also couldn't accomplish this in less than 30 pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The guide was made before they tuned pottery skillups.  They are much harder now.  I'd guess with a wis under 100 you'd be looking at spending at least double the 30p and possibly more.  <br />
<br />
If you can find any inexpensive gear to up your int, it would be well worth doing if you plan to do any more tradeskilling in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tingteng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're going to wish you did pottery a long time ago before they &quot;fixed&quot; it. Pottery was one of the tougher TSkills I have done. Personally I found it tougher than smithing. But that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rasi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well pottery went up rather swiftly till some 180 but then hell broke loose... i praised myself lucky if i could get a skill-up for every 60 combines i made... after 207 things went smoother again as i got 11 skill-ups in some 240 combines which i think is quite reasonable. I must say i have 355 wisdom so i really don't want to think what results you ll be getting with say 150 wis.<br />

I have a wisdom of 135 and I have spent 40+ platinum on pottery, and I'm only at 73.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>YurienStonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wait till you make casserole dishes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>czkjyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As of 9-3-2004 i followed the guide exactly and only managed to go from 0 - 39 following it step by step.  About to go look for a newer updated guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rabdos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I did it about a month and a half ago with INT just over 200. It probably took me 50-60pp to get up to 122. Haven't gone beyond that yet. You really need to raise your INT above 80. A couple of hundred plat will get you a bunch of +INT jewelry and items. Try to get a KEI, even if you're not using mana, it gives you an INT kick.<br />
<br />
If you can't afford 500-600pp for INT items, then you can't afford to do tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>czkjyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">according to what i have read, its intel for intel based characters, and wisdom for wisdom based characters.  I have heard ppl say dex is what makes your skill raise faster, but well maybe that works for melee or other type stuff, i have not seen any benifit in pottery.<br />
<br />
My wisdom is over 255, and so far i have spent a few thousand platinum just bringing my skill to 180 and a good number of hours (read that very many).<br />
<br />
I have been working on casserole dish's and am about to find my next item to begin to make as im nearing the limit for dish exp.<br />
<br />
Money is no concern of mine, i have plenty to work with for the things i want to do, which is why i started up a trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lilirith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did my pottery after the big change. I spent about 25k going from casserole trivial to 250. I plowed through it in a few sittings....a few LONG sittings.</div></div><hr />
