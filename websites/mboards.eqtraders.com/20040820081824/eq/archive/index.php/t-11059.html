<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone noticed any graphical issues with using illusion potions?  My barb shaman has on 2 seperate occasions tried using DE potions and the face becomes blacked out.  At first i thought is was just an error in my PC, but I had a friend come up to me in PoK and ask what was wrong with my face.  So she was seeing it that way also.<br />
<br />
Anyone else see anything like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>adetia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For some reason, my 2nd PC can't cope with /dopropertinting on with 100% success.  When I turn it on, a couple races have a blackened face like you describe, even when illusioned.  Perhaps you are experiencing the same thing, its the only time I've ever seen that  happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Panamah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I get the same thing with dopropertinting, just on a couple of characters though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same here... Perhaps we should look at the Graphics cards and drivers that folks are using.<br />
<br />
I am All Geforce, FX5200 4200TI and a 4600TI all of them will occasionally show Blacked faces for Dark Elves... That is the only time I have seen this.<br />
<br />
ANother possibility is something I noticed with my enchanter, Illusion Vah Shir she looks bodywise like a Tiger but her head is that of a Panther (dark grey). Is it possible that the facial combo that has been chosen has no match on the race that you illusion too and there for turns black?<br />
<br />
Just a few thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anyone /bugged it? At FF Scott Hartsman mentioned that there are a lot of issues with the display of heads and helms in general that are part of one big, complicated problem that they're hoping to get fixed in the not too, too distant future.  (This includes helms not showing when you return from some illusions, the infamous lip on shamans in bear form, etc.)  I don't know that these are necessarily related, but since it sounds like it's all issues with heads, they may be.  Either way, if you /bug it and give all the detail that you can it's more likely to get fixed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just Emailed EQbug with it, my theory on what is causing it and a possible Solution (Make the character appear as the &quot;Base&quot; character with illusions on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kheera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Vah Shir illusion issue is something with wearing a robe; you get mismatched head and body when you are illusioned Vah Shir while wearing a robe.  Easy solution until the bug is fixed: just take off the robe until illusion is cast.  My chanter carries a leather-look shirt for illusions for races with no robe graphic, in part for this very reason -- not quite wanting to strip to keep from being a mutant cat (or to appear half-naked under illusion either!)</div></div><hr />
