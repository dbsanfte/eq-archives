<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 55 Enchanter on Innoruuk, My research skill is 200 and I have automated quill (5% mod) the other day I was asked if I would attempt a spell research for a shaman, level 60 spell Primal Avitar I was given the components, I tried to combine (yes I have the new research book from gunthak and yes I included quill and parchment) but still got the error can not combine in this container...<br />
<br />
Rune of Association<br />
Yaeths Compendium Page 102 Left<br />
Runed Emblem<br />
<br />
Parchment<br />
Quill<br />
<br />
my only difference in above list is:<br />
<br />
Parchment = piece of Parchment<br />
Quill = A Quill<br />
<br />
my understanding is all INT classes can do priest class combines...<br />
<br />
also note that both Shaman and Enchanter have spell Ultravision but the research version is Enchanter only...why is this? <br />
<br />
granted the spell can be purchased in Oasis, but what is the point of research with issues like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">primal avatar was REMOVED from the books right after loy because well..<br />
<br />
The recipe is not valid basically<br />
<br />
<br />
The spell itself is no drop and only drops in st</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, all intel classes can make all priest spells... that are researchable.<br />
<br />
.. As for old world research.. all of the classes had their researchable spells fall into two categories:<br />
<br />
1) Researchable only.. about half the spells<br />
<br />
2) Researchable, and buyable... generally spells they shared with priest classes, but not always.  The idea, I belive, was to give the casters a few more recipies that they could gain skill on, without absolutely having to succede to gain their spells.<br />
<br />
Some of the multi-class research spells could be memmed by all that could use, even if the class wasn't listed on the researched scroll.  There are some notable exceptions, which were probably duplicate entries in the spell database.  There is actually 2 versions of Paralyzing Earth, for example.. but the chanter researched one is not scribable by wizzies   Seems like it'd be a big waste of database room.. but, it is how it is atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>salomeasillverfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Recipe has to be wrong, I ran into this with another shaman spell and turns out the page they had posted was wrong. Sal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Currently the site here has no recipe for the Spell: Primal Avatar (or Spell: Primal Avitar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kheera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ultravision is a sub-50 spell for shammies... and the priest LoY researchable spells are all 50+, so there's no special priest combine for it. <br />
<br />
I am surprised to hear that the researched one is NOT the same spell, scribable by both classes; I'm hoping that's not the same as Levitation, as I've gotten several combines for the chanter version, where I'm finding it hard to get my hands on the components for the priest one.  My poor chanter is level capped at 140 Research though so not going to try it to see quite yet!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>OberonMiM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually for ultravision they are scribable by those classes even though they arent listed (but why bother making it when you can buy it in oasis)<br />
<br />
They just have separate &quot;spell scroll&quot; items. You CAN scribe it if your class can use it (and its actually the same spell)<br />
<br />
as for levitation all types of researcha re usable by the 4 classes as far as i know</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is correct - I've researched the spell before and a druid bought &amp; scribed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'll elaborate a little.. on old world research scrolls.. almost all of the multi class research spells can be scribed by all classes that can use.  Paralyzing Earth is a specific one that can't be, for some reason.  I don't know if there are others, but i don't remember there being any that fit that other than PE.  I truely believe that this one is simply an error that's never been fixed.<br />
<br />
There is no recipe for Primal Avatar in the books anymore, so the logical assumption is, there is no valid recipe for it.  Given that, there are a handful of mods out there that are old enough they may still have it listed.  There was a thread here on the boards about it's removal some time ago.</div></div><hr />
