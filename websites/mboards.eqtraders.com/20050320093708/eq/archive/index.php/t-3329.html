<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilosh</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there I was, sitting down in SHadow Haven , at the jewelry shop.  You know the one, near the bazaar.<br />
<br />
<br />
My friend Arakni was working on her Jewelcraft, and a guildmate of ours was singing a mana song to help her enchant. <br />
<br />
<br />
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Smalltim, and I am an enchanter.   I was sitting there, discussing life with Arakni, and I got a wee bit bored.   I became an Ogre, and commented on my beauty.  I became a troll , and threatened to smash the Merchant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Much hilarity was had by all.   I even became a Earth Elemental, and made comments about taunting attackers, and begging forgiveness.   Arakni was amused, I was in stitches, and fun was had by all.<br />
<br />
All of sudden, I see FOUR guards agro on something... &quot;A fool you are to test your skills against mine!!!&quot;.  I wonder what poor slob decided to pull the guards, or hit the wrong hotkey, or what have you.  As I start to ponder this, 2-4 guards break down the door to the jewelry merchants shop, sending wood and metal everywhere.  They rush over, and without delay SLICE ME TO BITS.<br />
<br />
As I arrived at my bind point, Arakni stopped laughing long enough to tell me that 2?? guards decided I was a public menace and wailed on me.<br />
<br />
<br />
A little research about illusions and luclin, and I found out that while Iksar, Ogres, and other threats to society are allowed to run freely in SH, Elementals are apparently public menace #1.   How all of those Mage Pets have survived this long is a mind-boggler.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sufficed to say, this is one enchanter who won't be making any Mage Pets jokes ANYWHERE near SH anytime soon.   For all I know, a guard may decide to pass within 100 feet of me and RANDOMLY aggro.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At least I got a really good rez, thanks to Arakni's husband.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dieing for the amusement of others for damn near 7 months now,<br />

<br />
How can they allow those trolls, ogres and iksars into the zone and not skin them alive but a friendly mud puppy is not welcome??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimphe Wildwood</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And to think I introduced the two together  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morani</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might not be an &quot;elemental&quot; thing but a &quot;summonable&quot; thing with a special rule about pets for game mechanic reasons (so that guards don't then agro on the character like any other mob would). It wouldn't be much of a stretch to see that as part of the back-story for Shadow Haven considering it's formation from the opposing factions of the Combine Empire and all the magical nastiness that was used in that fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinile</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not just an SH thing, same thing happened to my enc in qeynos years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrtryx Conjureblade</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently, this doesn't apply to the Bazaar. I saw someone there who had become an Air Elemental (didn't check to see if it was an Enchanter or a Magician, though), and they were standing close to the Nexus bank. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info. If I ever get high enough, I plan on getting either the  Fire or Water elemental form (using AA points). Good to know where NOT to use it...(Because I wouldn't want to ruin faction by nuking any guards that aggro on me to death)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI - Pets generally share the faction set of the owner, and also have the special &quot;non-aggro&quot; rule. <br />
<br />
&quot;Non-Aggro Rule&quot; - A pet which has not yet gotten aggro'ed by a mob will not cause aggro.  This was implemented so that pets were more useful in dungeons.  A pet which is attacking other mobs will generate aggro as normal. <br />
<br />
To see the faction change in action, try charming a pet or doing a quest (Qeynos Invstigator) which turns an NPC into your pet.  His factions suddenly match yours.  A shaman friend of mine doing the quest above discovered that having a level 4 pet when you are KoS to the corrupt Qeynos quards (she's 56) is a bad thing. <br />

<br />
Monster illusions (elemental, werewolf, skeleton, etc.) generally lower your faction with many NPCs.  If your faction isn't high enough, it will drop you to KoS.  I forgot this one time and turned my friend into a fire elemental in SH once.    :oops: <br />
<br />
However, the patch yesterday changed this and non-racial illusions will no longer change your factions.</div></div><hr />

Those paving stones by the spires are still tinted slightly pink with Verdandi blood  :shock:   *hugs Cantatus!*  Speaking of which, maybe now I can demand more restitution in the form of continuing exploration of the joys of elemental illusions!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinuuyanea Nocturne</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skeleton and Spectre illusions havent affected factions in a long, long while; I know, I've checked.  I used to skeleton/spectre from to buy and sell in Oasis of Marr (they wont sell to a Dark Elf, but they will sell to a drybone or a spectre) until they &quot;fixed&quot; it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, sorry to hear about your death Noish, but now Ill tell my story...<br />
<br />
Way back when, I played an enchanter, I was new to EQ and had just gotten to level 12(FREAKIN UBER!!). I was SO happy I got my illusion Dark Elf form, because now I could do the Stein of moggok quest and make TONS of money.<br />
<br />
Well, I got a tell from a friend, who wanted to go hunt the bandit sisters in LFay. I said, sure(I had heard how they dropped bronze weapons that sold for 2pp!!). We met up at the Orc lift in Gfay, but we had to wait around for a while for others to get there. <br />
<br />
So for entertainment, I thought id put on a show for everyone(Gfay was packed back then). I knew Dark Elves were KoS, so I went away from the guards, more towards the actual Orc hill, and proceeded to cast illuion: Dark Elf.<br />
<br />
Everything was going fine, till....A faerie maiden has hit your Alot! ACK! What the heck?! A faerie maiden is still hitting you for Alot! Ok ok, drop illuion, A faerie maide is STILL hitting...neverming LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
Needless to say, my friend laughed himself silly over it, and never let me live it down. So remember everyone, Illusion are all fun and games till they get someone killed  :D</div></div><hr />
