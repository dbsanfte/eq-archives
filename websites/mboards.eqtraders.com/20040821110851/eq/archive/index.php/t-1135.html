<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goresmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I have a little project and I am wondering if you all might like to help me?  I have a very good friend of mine, and I want to get her something really special for Christmas.  I had no idea of what to get her until I found a Razorfiend Talon and a brick of Valorium on the same merchant.  Some how that just seemed like fate talking to me. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have everything for the combine but 2 important parts.  I need a Metallic Liquid, and I need an enchanter GM Jeweler to turn the vial and 2 saphires I have into Distilled Mana and make the final combine.<br />
<br />
Now I know the chances of finding a Metallic Liquid in time are pretty slim.  But I have one thousand plat left to my name to buy it with.  So if you might know someone, that has a cousin, who's dog groomers wife's best friend, etc... has one then let me know.<br />
<br />
Oh if any GM Jewelers want to step up for the combine your more than welcome.  And yes I know you might fail, and if so, well you fail, no biggy. :)  (Except for a weepy troll that is. ;))<br />
<br />
Thanks all,<br />

P.S.  Shhhh its a secret so don't go telling my friend about it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wystie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're going to have a difficult time finding metallic liquid for 1k, when others are willing to pay upwards of 10k and the product sells for 40-60k on Xegony.  That being said, if you're able to get your mits on one, I'd be willing to Imbue it for you and craft the ring if you like.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goresmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Woohoo, great Wyst, thanks muchly. :D<br />
<br />
Now to find me a liquid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll keep an eye out for ya's ;) Tell me in game, I have something to ask bud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lanadena sidles up to Goresmash, acting nonchalant.  Out of the side of her mouth, she whispers a single word, &quot;Thorserti.&quot;  Lanadena wanders off.<br />
<br />
<br />
/ooc <br />
I just logged off trading mode and a message from Thorserti in Auction chat caught my attention.  He wants to sell metallic liquid!  I did a /who on him thinking that I might be able to get a guild name and you could get in touch, but Thorserti already logged.  He didn't say what the price was, only that he wanted to sell it.  Good luck!   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goresmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well thanks to Xekl for a metallic liquid ! :)<br />
<br />
And Wyst for her wonderful combineing and imbueing skills. :D<br />
<br />
I now have a Valorium ring of Gallantry.  Well I did for like 10 seconds until I gave it to my friend for her Christmas present. :D<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone that helped out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wystie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Glad to help Gore! :)</div></div><hr />
