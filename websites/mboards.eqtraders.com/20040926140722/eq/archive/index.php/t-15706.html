An in-game dwarf smith friend of mine hasn't been playing much at all recently and I've been holding on to materials for some brellium chain combines for my berserker.<br />
<br />
I'm a 230 High elf smith willing to trade cultural combines with a dwarf smith.  Or if someone wants to do the combines just for the chance of a skillup, I'd be willing to do that too.<br />
<br />
I'm on brell server.<br />
<br />
I have <br />
20xenchanted large bricks of brellium<br />
20xvelium rings<br />
20xearthen tempers<br />
20xcelestial tempers<br />
<br />
I'm going to do Tae Ew for some, but Brellium has better AC/HP on some pieces.  He's level 41 now, and Brellium has a recommended (not required) level.<br />
<br />
I want:<br />
Face<br />
Belt<br />
Shoulders<br />
Arms<br />
<br />
You get to keep anything left over after I get my four pieces of armor.<br />
<br />
Also thought this info might be useful to other dwarf smiths looking for stuff to make for sale.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I'd like you to be in the 240's after you geerlok kicks in.  If you're close we can talk about it.</div></div><hr />
