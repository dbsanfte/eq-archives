<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQprices team</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings fellow EverQuesters,<br />
<br />
We are glad to inform you that the famous www.EQprices.com site is back on track<br />
with the EverQuest economy!<br />
<br />
We have been working hard to provide you with the following revolutionary pricing<br />
features <br />
<br />
 Complete price checks taken directly from the Bazaar, on every server! We have hired a whole new staff team that is continually monitoring the Bazaar, extracting the real-time prices at which the trades take place in game.<br />
<br />
This will ensure the most accurate price quotes you can find. Our main concern is to show the current in-game economy as it is, with the on-going prices up to date on all servers.<br />
<br />
 EQprices is now totally free of charge! The FlashLink subscription is no longer required, and everyone is welcomed to visit our website for free as many times as you wish.<br />
<br />
 Prices are updated on a regular basis (we are aiming to reach weekly updates of every item on every server once we are working at full speed)! This constant updating will ensure that all the prices are currently applicable. No more out-dated and inflated prices.<br />
<br />
 Prices statistics to come! Weekly, monthly, yearly, highest, lowest, averages, you name it, by server and by item. We're working on implementing all of this as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
 Full update of the items database, with proper statistics and new items.<br />
<br />
As you can see, Eqprices.com, one of the most renown and popular EverQuest sites, is back at full gas. We will try to do our very best in order to fulfill your expectations and we are positive you will not be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your support!<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
The EQprices Team<br />

<br />
I do kind of have a question though:<br />
extracting the real-time prices at which the trades take place in game<br />
How?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definately a form letter...<br />
<br />
But it doesn't 'seem' to be an advertisement for anything against the Eula unless they are doing something to check transactions as Craftah was asking.<br />
<br />
I've seen people brag about their site in a less professional way without it being frowned upon.<br />
<br />
I'd actually be interested to know some of the pricing on other servers, now if only I could check from work what my trader has sold today, hehehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandaie</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beats me, since they ditched the flashlink crud its kind of just free info now (I block all known ad sites as well as stop all popups, so that stuff never bothers me if it has any)<br />
<br />
It has limited use though for me. I guess for somene slacking at work its nice ;) I'd just get in eq in the bazaar to check prices instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slacking?<br />
<br />
I resemble that remark.<br />
<br />
Its a dirty job, but someone has to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grozza</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great concept, too bad it's so incomplete. I searched for a few things that are always for sale (leather padding for example), and it couldn't find any, on any server. I find that very hard to believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kredal</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*ponderances*... there must be some way you could have your trader log uploaded to a personal website somehow every once in a while (half hour or hour) automatically, so you could go to that site from work and see a nearly up-to-date list of what has been sold... <br />
<br />
I might have to see about this.  (:<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Looks like that's something that ws_ftp can do out of the box... Look into the Scheduler section of ws_ftp...</div></div><hr />
