hides for me. They're just oogly rare, you'll mow thru a LOT of spawns<br />
to get more than one or two. I gave up, and pay people exping on them<br />
in OT and LOIO for them. It's a win-win that way, for both them and I.<br />
<br />
I've never seen the 'cat' version drop it, Im guessing they're too immature to have such a quality hide. But I may be wrong :)</div></div><hr />

How does it feel to be responsible for someone dieing to a merchant?<br />

<br />
Currently, all my needs are met by long standing suppliers, the Bazaar and the occasional merchant.<br />
<br />
In the early days, I tried hunting sabertooths myself, but it just wasn't worth it. The hides are an uncommon drop.<br />
<br />
As a porting druid, there is a nifty and quick way to buy from players.<br />
<br />
1. Port to Skyfire<br />
2. Egress to Skyfire/Overthere zoneline.<br />
3. Zone to Overthere.<br />
4. Auction to buy excellent sabertooth hides while running to Frontier Mountains.<br />
5. Zone into Frontier Mountains.<br />
6. Egress to FM/Lake of Ill Omen zoneline.<br />
7. Zone to LOIO<br />
8. Auction to buy excellent sabertooth hides while running to Firiona Vie zoneline.<br />
9. Zone to Firiona Vie.<br />
10. Auction to buy excellent sabertooth hides in Firiona Vie.<br />
<br />
I would average 2 - 3 hides each run. As time went by, people would save them for me.<br />
<br />
You are also on Povar, Lilosh, so I'm sure it would work for you. Wood elf cultural is excellent for skilling up. BTW, I paid 20pp per hide and never had a problem meeting my needs.<br />

I'll assume that was the price you paid from your runs through zones.  I've never seen Excellent hides for anything less than 100pp each in the Bazaar on Sol Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasu</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been &quot;farming&quot; the bazaar on sol ro for these hides for about a month or two now... the actual prices tend to range from 10pp right up to 200pp.<br />
<br />
I pay on average 50pp for them when negotiation is possible.</div></div><hr />
