<br />
What your skill when you attempted, and how many tries did it take you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bartox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">first attempt - success (250 + trophy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">250 + 5% geerlock, got it on first attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Leafrat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, thats a relief...out of curiousity, has anyone attempted it at 220+ 5% ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zakik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">gimme a week, should be to 220 by then, have done smithing, jc, and brewing so far with 220, no fails as of yet, even got 2 skillups $ roommate is doing the same, he had a couple fails, but not much major</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Marinoni Oakenshield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you are talking of failure, are you talking the final step, the 3 sacred water + wooden signet in the Sacred Urn?<br />
<br />
I am at skill 222 +5% skill modifier, and I was wondering if it would be cheaper just to take the few failures along the way to make this vs doing bands or idols to 240 or so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Leafrat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm talking about the combine to MAKE the urn.<br />
<br />
The combine involving the three waters inside the urn I thought was nofail...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gherad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did all the pottery combines at 220 skill (+ geerlock) without any failures.  But perhaps I was just lucky.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Quikpick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Can take anywhere from half hour to 12 hours for the 2 waters Zand. Any white armor type model can drop the water.</div></div><hr />

PS - did second time at max skill and did it in one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i was 220 +geerlok when i did the combine and got it on first try as well....<br />
<br />
the pottery part is easy, only hard part is getting the sacred water after, which is a no fail combine...<br />
<br />
took a guild group about 3 hours to get 6 waters for me and another who needed....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Galain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">For a 65 Druid, no.  I think a necro or enchanter could probably do it, but these guys hit pretty hard and summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">250 base + pottery GM trophy.<br />

Success on the unfired urn and promptly failed on the firing part.<br />
<br />
2nd try - fail on the unfired urn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just an FYI<br />
<br />
I read a thread somewhere on this board that said you could use flasks of water to combine with your 3rd earring in the fired urn to finish it.<br />
<br />
Confirmed last night, that flasks of water do not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Aid Grimel says although I have some experience in the planes, I lack what he needs. The quest write up says I need: LMM, Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek and pre-flags (TT &amp; MB) <br />
<br />
I have TZ, VZ, TT, MB. What's LMM? I said 'what information' to Maelin but when I do a guided meditation it tells me the notes from TZ and VZ are scribbled in a language I cannot comprehend - I read somewhere that they need to say something different - can anyone help?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Rats :/ before the guides were split up, I thought all I had to aim for was:<br />
<br />
Flag requirement: Talking to Maelin to go after Rallos Zek (which still appears on the pottery section).<br />
<br />
Guess I'm stuffed then, as no-one ever bothers with opens raids on MM during my playtime. Someone started one last night, but only 27 turned up.<br />
<br />
Bah. I wish I hadn't turned in my velium blue diamond ring, I'd have kept it if I'd known I couldn't continue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Aalar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">You can always go back and do the quest up to that point again.  I may do that just to have an EB item myself.<br />
