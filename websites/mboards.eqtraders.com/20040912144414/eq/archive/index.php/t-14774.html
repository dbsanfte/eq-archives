<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is some confusion regarding what the function of the new bolas are.  In this thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14205), two posters claimed that bolas could be equipped in the range slot of berserkers, and that the bola worked like a bow in modifying the performance of their axes.<br />
<br />
To examine this claim, I experimented with tailored bolas on a level 1 dwarf berserker.  As a control I also used this throwing item:<br />
<br />
Dragon Claw Sliver<br />
Slot: RANGE  <br />
Skill: Throwing  Atk Delay: 36<br />
DMG: 5  <br />
WT:  0.5    Range: 45    Size: SMALL<br />
Class: WAR RNG SHD MNK BRD ROG NEC WIZ MAG ENC BST BER <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
First, I equipped a bola in the range slot and berserker axes in the ammo slot.  As others have found, when this was done, axes were thrown at targeted mobs, and they autofed, just like arrows do.  Next, I exchanged the bola with the axes, so now I had axes in the range slot and a bola in the ammo slot.  When I did this, the bola was thrown.  I then repeated this using axes and Dragon Claw Slivers, and found that whatever item was equipped in the ammo slot was thrown.  Finally, I repeated the same procedure using bolas and Dragon Claw Slivers with identical results.<br />
<br />
Next, I repeated these same tests on my monk using shurikens made from smithing instead of axes and the same thing happened.<br />
<br />
So, the bottom line is this: if your character equips two different throwing items in the range and ammo slots, then the character will throw whatever item is in the ammo slot.<br />
<br />
I also tried to see if equipping the bola in the range slot had any effect on what was thrown from the ammo slot.  I couldn't tell if there was any distance effect with the axes since the throwing distance for the axes (125) was somewhat close to that for the bola (200).  However, when I had a bola equipped with the Dragon Claw Slivers in the range slot, there was no improved range on these items (45).  Although I did not parse damage from bola equipped versus axe equipped throwing damage, I could detect no higher damage from thrown axes when a bola was equipped in the range slot versus when axes were equipped in the range slot.<br />
<br />
So my second conclusion is that bolas behave like any other throwing item and not like a bow.  They do not modify the damage or range attributes of items thrown from the ammo slot.<br />
<br />
Two caveats to these results: (1) the second conclusion was not based on a definitive test.  It would be desireable to measure damage output and distance using a more controlled test on rooted mobs over the course of many throws.  My suspicion is, however, that such a test would confirm my second conclusion. (2) I did not use bolas that had been combined with stun or damage potions to see if the properties of the bola (stun or dd damage) were tranfered to the item thrown from the ammo slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>velk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made some bolas and tested them.<br />
<br />
If you equip a shaman potion in the range slot and the bola in the ammo slot, it will fire the potion to the bola range.<br />
<br />
If you equip the bola in the range slot and another thrown weapon in the ammo slot the proc effect of the concussive bola will not apply to the thrown weapon.<br />
<br />
Now if the potion throwing thing is a bug, the question springs to mind of what exactly the bolas are *for*.<br />
<br />
They are certainly a ludicrously impractical thrown item for the effort involved in creating them.<br />
<br />
As an aside - I tested thrown item in range slot and bola in ammo slot and got the message 'out of ammo' rather than the bola being thrown, just a FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting post Velk, thanks.  I knew you could equip a potion in the range slot and a bola (non-conusion type) in the ammo slot and the potion would be thrown.  Potions do not seem to act like &quot;normal&quot; thrown items.<br />
<br />
As far as a bola being in the ammo slot and another item in the range slot, I'll have to go back and check.  Now that I think about it, I may have had bolas equiipped in both slots when I threw the bola from the ammo.<br />
<br />
I think the bottom line is that both bolas and potions are not implemented properly.  Throwing items made using smithing (knives, javelins, and shurikens) work fine.  I don't see why these items should not be able to have the same functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>da_erck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The first trial of the berserker epic includes a special throwing part. For this you recieve three (3) Bore Axes of the Spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60191) from the NPC (although you can hail him for more once you used those axes).<br />
The effect allows the mob to be hurt at all (although it seems to be bugged and anyone can hurt it even without using those axes, anyways...).<br />
If you have those axes in your range slot, and use normal berzerker summoned axes in your ammo slot, you will throw the summoned axes and do the normal damage from them, however they will get the proc from the Bore Axes of the Spirit.<br />
<br />
So my guess is the idea of Bolas is indeed to be some sort of sling that will add procs and maybe other effects/stats to normal throwing weapons</div></div><hr />
