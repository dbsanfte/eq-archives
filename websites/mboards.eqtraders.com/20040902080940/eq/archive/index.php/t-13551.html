<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm ecstatic that I'm finally done with the platinum ribbons, maybe even moreso than I was when I did that final combine on Wu's.  Now at least I don't have to spend hours farming plat to pay for those expensive combines.  (Yes, I know, now its hours farming for hides, metals and the like.)<br />
<br />
This message board and website in general has been a tremendous help, offering encouragement, advice, sympathy and consolation when I most needed it.<br />
Thanks!!<br />

You mean you're quitting tailoring?  :D  Give it ten more points of even more hours and more expensive combines and you'll long for the good old days of easy ribbon skill gains...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had about 45 HQ brute hides and misty acorns stocked up, so I went through those very quickly.  I have my skill up to 190 now.  I was surprised at the success rates though.  I did plain reinforced vale leathers (trivial at 215) to start, then did a stack of imbued vale reinforced leathers (trivial 228).  I crafted a full set of the imbued out of one stack of HQ brute hides.  I'd estimate I probably had better than an 85% success rate on them.<br />
<br />
Going to do a combination of solstice robes and velious leathers (specifically the wyverns) to continue.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haha, you're far from done with plat unless you want to hit 250 in about 2 years of solo farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Emron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, I realize that I will be spending more plat on tailoring.  I was just excited to reach that hurdle.</div></div><hr />

I just got done with Wu's and was really happy.  This post has made me want to cry.  Ugh . . . what possessed me to think that I wanted to GM tailoring?!?!?!  <br />
