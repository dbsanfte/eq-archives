<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veldin Darkfire</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a young High Elf named Veldin who was new to the land of Norrath and after having been gifted with some amazing items of power by great and might friends (read 2 +2 sta earrings from a L24 chanter) he set off to conquer the world.<br />
<br />
A few irritating deaths later he realized that even with his amazing items of power he would need better protection and yet the stored sold nothing of worth.  What would he do?  He searched high and low and discovered that with some practice he could Tailor his own protection.<br />
<br />
Karana had smiled upon this High Elf for he was a Magician and though he did not know it his Water Elemental was immune to poisons and did seem to be the best pet to use against these spiders.<br />
<br />
Many other young adventurers gained peicemeal armor as this High Elf worked towards making himself armor.  Once the armor was acheived he set his sights on riches and services to people by making the fantastic 10 slot backpacks.  A skill of 88 seemed SO far away.<br />
<br />
One day while exploring the Western Karanas, Veldin entered the house of a merchant to buy some patterns to make some armor with his new Bear Pelt of the Highest Quality. The fight had been long but in the end the magician and pet had prevailed.<br />
<br />
So after having bought a pattern and upon placing the pelt into his sewing kit he prepared to hit combine.  Upon hitting combine A Grizzly Bear spawned and attacked the defenseless mage killing him.<br />
<br />
MOST irate at this cruel joke by the gods he sent his plea to them /petition HI there I was tailoring and when I combined a bear skin a bear spawned and attacked and killed me.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later a godling came to see what the problem was. &quot;A bear spawned when you combined its hide in your sewing kit?&quot; the godling said?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;, replied Veldin &quot;You can see my body right there. Was this something intentional and I will now have to be wary when stiching the hides of dead animals together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm this is a new thing to me&quot; spoke the godling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be happy to demonstrate for you again if you like&quot; replied Veldin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok here is a hide please do&quot; the godling said and upon this handed Veldin a new bear skin to tailor into a bear.<br />
<br />
Into the kit went the skin and the required components. Combine Veldin did click and LO....no bear showed up to maul the magician.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm I don't understand what happened? IT appeared behind the merchant and killed me last time. This makes no sense?&quot; spake the bewilderd High Elf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me use my powers to see the past&quot; and for moments the godling was silent...&quot;Ah heh it appeared that a bear wandered right past the back of the house as you hit combine and aggroed on you thereby coming through the wall to kill you&quot;. Laughed the godling.<br />
<br />
Laughing Veldin was relived that his tailoring was not going to spawn dead creatured back to life. Looting the rest of his items, he had a good chuckle with the godling and they both went on thier seperate ways.<br />
<br />
The End<br />
<br />
True story of what happened to me when I was new to the game...oh so many years ago. I was somewhere around level 10ish.<br />
<br />
Soo how did you get into tailoring and what funny ancedotes do you have with your tailoring carreer?<br />
<br />

Good story.<br />
<br />
I started with tailoring when I was a newbie, I wanted something more than the regular guild robe.  <br />
<br />
embarassing/funny stories?<br />
<br />
I actually DRANK some of my stock o Heady Kiolas once (purely as a pain reliever for my aching fingers, I swear!)<br />
<br />
I once sold a couple of HQ bear skins to a merchant before I knew they could be made into backpacks  :oops: <br />
<br />
other stuff, the usual combining of stacks instead of single items, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leafrat</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started tailoring to do the shawl quests  :oops: <br />
<br />
I admit it!  Don't hurt me!  <br />
<br />
I got my shawl8 long ago however and still tradeskilling, getting close to me goal of 250/200/200/200 etc.  Don't know if I'm gonna go farther tho, heh dunno if I would survive such an act!<br />
<br />
Funny story...hmmm<br />
<br />
Well...its not funny...kind of painful, actually.  But, anyway.  I was a forager long before I was a tradeskiller, and I have an innate reflex to<br />
<br />
1) forage<br />
2) eat it<br />
3) drop it if I can't eat it<br />
<br />
Well...its a reflex that no matter how hard I try I can not break!  I've eaten Dragon Eggs, Drake Eggs, Justice Fruit Pies, JGP stuff... I guess thats not really funny...  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GunnyBurlfoot</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gunny started out wanting to be a tailor. I remember many silk swatches being made back in Nro and Oasis off of the spiders. <br />
<br />
I found I need smithing for boning, and so plunked myself down in North Freeport until I had a decent (100 or so) smithing skill. Then later, hauling my sewing kit all over EK, kiting the crags, hounds, lions, etc. <br />
<br />
Then Kunark came out, and I started down there to exp (20s). Then I found a new source of tailoring. Monks that wanted monk armor to cover their scaly hides :)<br />
<br />
So, I took up brewing to make Kiolas. I thought I hated Kiolas then.. my feeling for them pales in comparison to what I felt later, after Velious came out, and the Wu's armor beckoned me. I also started the shawl quest back when Velious first opened without knowing what it was. The first two ones were easy, but the next one required baking, so I made batwing crunchies, followed by giant steaks.<br />
<br />
I have been greened to death many a time in search of more tailoring components, and have accidentally destroyed too many cultural and coldain kits to list. :)</div></div><hr />
