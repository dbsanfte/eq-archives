<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armorsmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  All thought I have often looked at these boards for ideas I have never posted until now.  I am currently at an unmodified 212 skill and trying to sort through which would be ideal to raise my skill.  I am a human smith and have a decent amount of plat to use.  I got to 212 on LDoN smithing but was doing Field Plate before that.  If anyone has any thoughts I would love to hear them.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reddoak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Enchanted Velium Bits (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9525&amp;menustr=080100020000) to 222 Skill.<br />
<br />
After that, 3 of the options you have are as follows:<br />
<br />
Luclin Plate Armors (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=129&amp;rsa=Smithing&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=lplate&amp;menustr=080100140000) and Luclin Chain Armors (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=128&amp;rsa=Smithing&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=lchain&amp;menustr=080100120000)<br />
~ These will get you up to 250 (if you do shadowscream after <br />
acrylia plate trivials at 232), but will entail either a TON of farming for <br />
components or a lot of money buying acrylia.<br />
~ Since Shadowscream entails mostly no drop farmed <br />
ingredients, it is the cheapest to make.<br />
 (Edit: Thank you for the correction on trivials Balkin,<br />
I must've looked at acrylia plate when I said chain trivials <br />
that high. :boggled: )<br />
<br />
Human Cultural Armor - Freeport Cultural (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=74&amp;rsa=Smithing&amp;rc=HUM&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=freeport&amp;menustr=080040070020) and Qeynos Cultural (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=75&amp;rsa=Smithing&amp;rc=HUM&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=qeynos&amp;menustr=080040070040)<br />
~ These will get you to 250 skill as well, but require blue <br />
diamonds for the infused high quality rings used for the <br />
combines, it'll get pricy as well over time unless you're able <br />
to sell succsess to cover the costs.<br />
<br />
Mistletoe Cutting Sickle (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1621&amp;menustr=035000000000)<br />
~ This is THE ultimate plat sink if you have cash to burn, but <br />
it's also one of the quicker ways to skillup. (Not recommended <br />
unless you're swimming in 200kpp+.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You didn't mention Luclin Acrylia Plate armor specifically, though I think it was implied with a listed high trivial of 242. A colossal hassle with the 2 windstones and 1 essence of wind per temper requirement, though farming the acrylia itself isn't so bad.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm at 221 myself. I do acrylia plate (the acrylia chain is all trivial at 215) when I have ingredients... I do Dwarven cultural plate when I get orders, and otherwise I'm farming for Shadowscream. Unfortunately, I'm not swimming in plat, so I'm taking the longer cheaper road.<br />
<br />
Once I get to 230+ with gearlock, I'll consider doing runs of 20 Mistletoe cutting sickles. That way I can figure on enough successes to cover the cost of the run. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Once I hit 240, I'm home free. I can make a trophy with max success rate, and BD armor etc... I figure from 240 on, I'll skill as I make things I want/need and get to 250 that way.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your smithing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 212, you can still make enchanted velium bits for 10 more skill points.  They are pretty easy to make, and cheap too (if you farm your own velium) at around 18PP per combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am sitting at 214 + modfier, and I prefer skilling up on the $$ combines.  It is slow, but more beneficial to the bank.  I have specifically been making Tae Ew Chain stuff and shields, I have about a 66% success rate.   When I have the velium at my disposal I am make the bits, but after I hit 220, Ill stop smithing for skill ups and use the money combines to randomly skill up to 250. <br />
<br />
(220 +15% = 253, or maxed skill)<br />
<br />
(BTW: My modifier is +15%, a hammer of the ironfrost, a rare drop off a relatively easy mob for middle experience/geared, pre-PoP, lvl 65, raiding guilds.)</div></div><hr />
