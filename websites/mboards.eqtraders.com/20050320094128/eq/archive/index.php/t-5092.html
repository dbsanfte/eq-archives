You see, since I'm lvl 26 money making is hard. And when I need money I would go to the Aqua Goblin camps and stack up on items and sell them for 4pp a pop and yey! Money for tradeskills and spells! But now, they nurfed the AGs on tunare and I have no other money making method.  :cry: <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions? Lately I've been in Karana killing Gnols for there Bronze and Steel weapons but since I'm high elf I can only carry like 3 before I'm over weight. And also I usually spend about 10pp on KEI's all the time. Not to mention what i spend on Malachite and stones for my buffs.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me a little advice here? Maybe so I can buy a little equipment and spells. I'm missing items in 7 slots of my character and the only actual good item that I have is a Netted Kelp Tunic. =(<br />
<br />
My last bit of money is drying up like a puddle in the desert. Lol<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My best advice = Just continue to play... sell everything you come across and the pp will slowly trickle in.<br />
<br />
High Keep is a good spot to go at your level, go down and kill goblins.. very often these days most people just want to level fast and are already twinked out, so they forego any loot.. On one occation I was down there and no one in the group wanted loot.  A bronze weapon/armor peice here, a HQ ore brick there, up to 3 or so pp per kill, it does add up, even if you're spliting it with other group members.. plus there's a merchant within spitting distance and a bank one stumble further.<br />
<br />
Get to about lvl 30 down there and you'll have sufficient pp to last you awhile along with the petty cash you get in other places.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 49 the cash comes flowing as you can take out Seafurries in OOT for exp and Hill Giants in Rathe with ease..<br />
<br />
For now, just enjoy yourself and whack every decaying skele with a weapon you come across.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also do the quest in Gukta for a 20% weight reduction bag. I did that with my Ranger, but haven't done it with Zyrtryx yet. You just have to get the quest from the NPC then hand him 4 specific rusty weapons.<br />
<br />
Forget the Aqua Gobbies. I'm a lvl 36 High Elf Magician, and I've NEVER camped them. Try farming Spiderling Silks and selling them in the Bazaar. 2 to 4pp a silk (that's a SILK, not a STACK) is a decent price to charge. <br />
<br />
If you've never camped Dervish Cutthroats in North Ro or WC, then go check out Murissa Sandwhisper (vendor in the dirt if you're coming from East Freeport) and buy any spiderling silks she has. I once bought 5 stacks of silks off her!  Then check the vendors in the inn. (You can check the fishing huts, too, but I've rarely found Spiderling Silks for sale there)<br />
<br />
Grab any LQ, MQ or HQ cat pelts the vendors have, too. You can resell them for decent profit, as well. Don't bother making Leather Padding, unless you're doing them to raise Tailoring skill. You're better off just selling the silks and pelts as is.<br />
<br />
(If you have camped Dervs and she cons Dubious, then use an alt or pay someone in the zone to buy from Murissa. She's on Derv faction.)<br />
<br />
North Ro is great for farming spiderling silks. I'm KoS in the area, unfortunately (killed the WC tollbooth guards a lot back around lvl 28 ), so I use a Ranger alt to do it. (The Tracking comes in handy)<br />
<br />
Don't bother farming Spider Silks, unless you want to use them to train up Tailoring. They don't sell.</div></div><hr />

On my server HQ cat pelts go for 8pp(i've sold two). I dunno about silks, I guess I could give that a shot. I was also thinking about going to CB and whiping out all the leigonaires and selling there shoulderpads in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Zyrtryx, you killed the guards with your 28 Mage? If you did thats cool! I'm lvl 27... Might try and wack one around... Not kill it... Wack it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
literally, crab spiderlings everywhere. i think alot of people realized this because within a week there were high lvls of other races scourging the area and shouting in /ooc for 1pp a silk.</div></div><hr />

Great exp still at 26, exp bonus in the zone.  The mobs drop FS weapons, HQ ore, and Unrefined ore.<br />
<br />
Sell FS and HQ to merchants (or use it for smithing), and turn in the unrefined ore to any of the guys on the moon for faction + PP.  Four large blocks of unrefined ore get you 44pp, not too bad a haul.<br />
<br />
The faction alone is worth the trip ;)<br />
<br />
Done right, you can solo your way to 30 there fairly quickly, and come out up a few hundred PP for your various new spells.<br />

There are Gypsy merchants in Lavastorm to sell to, or you can find the Gnomes deep in SolA.. but I don't know the area well enough for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My advice is to forget about the guards. (But, for the record, the WC toolbooth guards are lower lvl than most of the other Freeport Militia guards)<br />
<br />
If you really want to have some fun in WC, get a SoW and kill Kizdean Gix (using a fully buffed Earth pet....including dmg shield) then wait for Dragoon Zytool to spawn and see if you can take him out, too. (He spawns outside the entrance to Befallen as soon as Gix dies, but apparently runs around the zone at random) When Gix is close to dead, heal your pet up a bit and run over to Befallen so you can start fighting Zytool before he has a chance to summon a skeleton pet. (Even without a pet, Zytool is harder to beat than Gix.)<br />
<br />
Taking out Gix and Zytool should be easy, if you med to full before attacking Gix. Just dmg shield your pet and send him in, then fire off one attack spell and spend the rest of the fight healing your pet. You'll need the mana you save by not blasting Gix to take out Zytool (and his pet if you're too late to stop him from summoning one).<br />
<br />
Back on the subject:<br />
<br />
Also check Halas and the Everfrost vendors right inside the zone-in from Halas for Spiderling Silks (and Bear Pelts, but I rarely find any of those worth buying there). I forgot to mention that earlier.</div></div><hr />

Just level up.  Higher level stuff drops better loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True.  Even if your lvl 55 and smearing green goblins to loot and sell FS weapons.  With the 10 slot 100% WR bag you get with Gift of Xev I've easily made 60k off stuff most people wouln't even bother looting.</div></div><hr />

The only reason spider silks don't sell anymore on the Rathe is because I dinged 250 tailoring and I don't need them anymore. =)<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;-- makes joke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just baffled why you would buy KEI if you are broke. <br />
<br />
Shall I break this statement down?<br />
<br />
I can only speak as a wizard in this regard, but I believe it holds true for all pure casters.<br />
<br />
The mana regen and extra 250 mana in the pool makes it so you can go at least twice as fast, especially at low levels.<br />
<br />
So at level 25, if you could make 50pp an hour on FS/cash loot without C3, and 1 yellow that same hour....<br />
<br />
With C3, you could make 100pp an hour, and 2 yellows.<br />
<br />
So by the time C3 fades, you have made a full level, and are a couple hundred PP ahead of where you would have been had you not donated.<br />
<br />
That is at lvl 26. At level 34 for my wizard, C3 made HG's possible... without it it was simply impossible.  So the cost vs. reward just gets better as you level.<br />
<br />
At 49 I refuse to go solo for cash or exp without C3... simply because I get soo much more money, have sooo much less downtime, and get soo much more exp.<br />
<br />
So my question to you is... &quot;How can you afford not to buy C3?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Thanks, Delfontes!  Now if my lady in that range weren't a cleric, for whom soloing can only rarely be so efficient. . .oh well, time to go suck up to higher powered faction campers again.<br />
<br />
As for cash:  Mow down Karanas bandits for non-stacking sashes; turn those in Qeynos for bronze, right next to a vendor!  Those are so green they are migratory camps, so don't stress too much about your pet.  And think about picking up a hunting partner that will get xp from things that would be green to you (like Unrest first floor?), on the condition that they let you master loot--they get boosted xp, you get pp, all is good.</div></div><hr />

if you are buying SoW potions and KEI, why are there any spells (up to your current level) that you don't have?!  Buy your spells first, i daresay that paying for KEI and fighting at 1/4th your capacity because you haven't even bought the spells you should be using is less efficient that doing without it for a day.  And if you're burning an entire 10 dose potion per trip. . . something is seriously wrong.  <br />
<br />
Maybe so I can buy a little equipment and spells. I'm missing items in 7 slots of my character and the only actual good item that I have is a Netted Kelp Tunic. =(<br />
if any of your &quot;visible&quot; slots are unequiped (you said that 7 of your 13 slots are, so one of those at least must be a &quot;visible slot&quot;) fill them in with the newbie quest armor peices, they may not be the best, but they're certainly better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?<br />
Being a mage, you are perfectly suited to hunting in Twilight Sea on the elemental island for XP and drops.  Temper components, windstones, and the loot off the named should all help you build up your bank account.  all of your vs summoned nukes will work here, your pet should feel right at home, and there is a Magician trainer in the castle.  If you have invis (i believe mages get it at level 8?) you can even take the portal from Fungus Grove.  It's not the safest thing in the world, but it is doable and will keep you from needing a port.  As an extra bonus, you can start collecting Twilight Sea quest items.  the gear you get isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either, and it's usually inexpensive.<br />
<br />
Karana Bandits are a good choice for cash. their sashes only weigh 0.5 each, so you should be able to carry several bags of them, take them to Qyenos, turn them in for minor xp, faction, and bronze weapons (1.5 to ~4pp each).  the bandits themselves often carry bronze weapons as well.  If you fight the ones in North Karana (raiders) who are near the spoires, you can run to the tower and sell off to Biblis Briar when you get too heavy.  He offers horrible prices, but certainly better than nothing.<br />
<br />
You might also try selling some summoned items.  If you can set up in the bazaar overnight, you can probably sell low-level foci, food and water, summoned weapons, and whatever other usefull treinkets you have avaialable ton you for a small sum with no investment of cash.<br />
<br />
Another option, if you have a little starter money, is selling Celestial Essence in the bazaar, 3-5pp depending on your server's economy for doing a no fail combine.<br />
<br />
And I think Sony nurfed the gnols, they seem stronger than usuall. Before my pet would die maybe once out of 10 spawns. My pet died 6 times yesterday and I almost went with it. Not to mention this time I summoned it a shield and it STILL died!  I'm 22% to lvl 29, finally! When I ding I might go into paw for a while and see if I can ding 30.<br />
I'm not certain when mage pets get dual wield, but you may have cut your pet's damage output in half by giving it a shield. . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrtryx Conjureblade</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sithro, you might want to consider heading to Dawnshroud Peaks and looking for a group when you get to lvl 30 (You could probably do it now, but I'd wait). Download a map from EQAtlas, get KEI  and head up there, then ask if anyone is camping Tribals over near ME or GE. If they are, ask if you can join in. (If you can't get in a group, leave the zone. I didn't try soloing at all there at all until lvl 33 or 34) <br />
<br />
And make sure you're invisible while you go to join them. You'll run into a lot of mobs that will aggro on you and will kill you fast if you do not. <br />
<br />
Use the Earth pet if the party doesn't have at least three tanks, and the Air pet if they do (some Tribals cast, and the Air pet's stun will come in handy for stopping that). <br />
<br />
You might be able to hunt Tribals over at Grieg's End with just 3 people. If no groups are up, try to form your own. Look for a Monk to be the main puller, since Tribals will help each other if attacked and their are Lightcrawlers there. I wouldn't risk it at ME, though. (The Tribals seem to be closer together there)<br />
<br />
Tribals drop crap weapons (except for Polished Steel Ulaks), but sometimes they drop Acrylia, which you can sell for decent plat. I spent about 2 or 3 hours one night killing Tribals over at the entrance to Grieg's End with a Monk from my guild, and let the Monk sell the Acrylia in the Bazaar (I can't stay on all day or all night as a trader, and he can), splitting the plat from the sales 50/50. I made about 240pp from that.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do, DO NOT hang around the zone-in from the Netherbian Lair. Its Train Central.</div></div><hr />

Plus the excellent sabertooth hides sell pretty well at around 50 pp on bertoxx.  Somehow I don't think thats enough money though... Sorry, I never really paid attention to plat at 25, I was too much of a noob lol.  Hope my advice helps at least a little.</div></div><hr />

He says you'll get a nice amount of money there. The reason I went through a sow potion at a time was the steel weapons I had weighed me down. And most of the time I would nuke something and it would jump me instead of my pet. But I've figured out a way to stop them from jumping me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm lvl 29, got some new pets and spells. I still have so many spells to get like Demensonal Pocket etc. I still have alot of reasearch spells to get too. But I'm working on it, it's not easy. Lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple.  He's broke.  He's level 29 with 7 empty inventory slots. Obviously, money making with KEI isn't good enough to cover expenses. Therefore, don't spend money on KEI.<br />
<br />
If you don't know how to do something well with a crutch, you're hosed, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
A full spellbook and all my slots full are a higher priority than better mana regen.<br />
<br />
I am, also, inclined to wonder how much you really save if you need to run with your tail between your legs back to the bazaar every 90 minutes to accomplish anything. Noting that this is not someone with ports.</div></div><hr />

The essences sell in the bazaar for 5-10PP usually on Xegony, and I sell to fellow tradeskillers for no more than 5PP...they get 'em for cheaper than bazaar, easier than making them, and I still profit!

<br />
Ok, heres whats been happening. I'm now lvl 30! Yey!!!<br />
<br />
My gear problem has been solved... For a while. My friend has a wizard but he made a monk and is having to time of his life with it. So he let me borrow his wizzys 10k in gear for a few weeks. This made my INT go to 208 without KEI!<br />
<br />
I have found a way of killing gnols without them agroing on me. So no real need for Sow Potions anymore. That saves alot of money!<br />
<br />
Yesterday I bought about 100plat in spells so I filled up a few spots in my collection. Also, I got the spell dimensional pocket so I can carry more weapons... Which means more money!<br />
<br />
And finally with all this good stuff happening I can buy my KEI without loosing much! WOOOT!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would like to ask for places a lvl 30 could hunt for money. So that way when I have to give the gear back and go buy Sow potions... It wont hurt me much.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />
