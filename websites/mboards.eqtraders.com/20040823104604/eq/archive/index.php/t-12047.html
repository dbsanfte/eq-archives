<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm going with marmalade sandwiches.  no fails 1 stack of fruit gives 1440 meals.  also, the trivial is 99 for both so you can get good success rather quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ndaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My mains are a mage and a druid. So i use summoned &amp; foraged on them. All my alts get whatever food I've currently got too much of. My warrior STILL uses Halas Pies as filler food :) I get enough excess foraging that filler food is never an issue... although I do like using Halas Pies! VERY filling!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol.  expecting something like 1000 pies on my current run.  no wr bag better than reinforced stachel of abukar though so wont be filler food for wizard main.  now all my melee will eat it forever.</div></div><hr />

Trivs at 135 so it's a major skiller since it only takes a fresh fish and a batwing, both of which can be found on merchants next to each other in PoK. Bring your own spit, the oven is clear on the other side of the zone.<br />
<br />
It weighs .1 and is a banquet sized meal.<br />
<br />
It's good for those who don't forage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">still have a couple alts with fish rolls and more with patty melts from when i skilled up.  i meant as something to make myself for filler food.  collapsible spit has freed me from a lot of worry about keeping a spit on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quichon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can't get much better than 0.1 wt and banquet sized meal for filler food.  One batwing and one fish.  Pull out your fishing pole and kill a few bats if you're running low on them.<br />
<br />
Then again, since I'm a monk I have to watch my weight, so having food that weighs 0.1 is a good thing, and the fact that it is a banquet sized meal makes it better because that one stack will last a long time.  You may not care about carrying around ten stacks of filler food.  Me, I can't afford the space or wt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah i can really see fish rolls as better for monks.  i carry my collapsed spit half the time so a stack of maramalade and a stack of bread makes 240 meals.  that last longer than 20 banquets.  for ease though fish rolls prolly ar better though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bregalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gunthak fishing seems to be a good place for filler food.   Bay seaweed and moray eel, both fished in Gunthak, both make miraculous meals with just one extra component...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Prodox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I usually fill myself up with truffles.  As a druid the shrooms are always in my pack and the rest is relatively cheap.  The most expensive thing is the eucaliptis (sp?) and one goes a LONG way.<br />
