<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive decided to ask here, instead of my guild website, or even my servers message board, because I know these boards get more traffic on them than the other two combined times 10, lol.<br />
<br />
Just today, ive been crashing directly to desk top at random times(actually, only while im in OT), and I have no idea why. Yesterday i was running fine. I didnt run the patcher(i use the run command to bypass it unless theres a patch day, because its faster), crashed to desktop. So I ran the patcher, same thing. Thought &quot;ok, maybe its because i left my trader up all night&quot;, so i restarted and tried again, same thing!<br />
<br />
So right now, im running the &quot;Thorough patch&quot; in hopes that ive missed something and that will fix it. Im also going to delete the OT files and repatch them(maybe they got corrupted), but im a pessamist and have a feeling that that wont fix it. I dont run a fire wall, my connection is stable, i have above the EQ system requirements and the only UI fix ive made has been the 80 slot vendor fix. So, does anyone have any idea what could be doing it? Thanks for any help that you can give.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you checked your packet rates to see if the are redding out? <br />
<br />
How do you connet? (dial-up, Cable, DSL, Proxy, etc)<br />
<br />
Have you been in this zone RECENTLY before this crash series? If not, you might want to try deleting the zone file like you mentioned.<br />

What's your Graphics Card?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farnyr</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, lets see, Bad word filter was turned off about 5 minutes after logging in after LoY. Im not redding out from packet lose. Its a complete drop to desktop, as in &quot;Now you are in the outpost in OT, and now you are looking at your desktop&quot;. It has been a few days since ive been in OT, so I deleted its files and patched them, also ran my Ad-Aware, just in case its one of those. Running stable right now, but you never know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramlador</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you say that it is only happening it OT, I would definately try deleting ALL files that have to do with that zone, then repatching to download them again. Even a thorough patch doesn't catch some of the problems that can happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aoladari Raveynfyre</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to be careful of when bypassing the patcher, they DO patch files without taking the server down on occasion. I've seen my patcher working like this alot recently so it might be something to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malathos</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Re-patch telling the patcher to do a thorough check. This can catch issues that the patcher misses on a &quot;normal&quot; run.  <br />
<br />
Delete the texture cache file for OT (should be a .txc) just in case it's corrupted and giving grief.<br />
<br />
Check out the dbg.txt file next time you crash and see if you can trace what the last thing the game was doing before it crashed.</div></div><hr />
