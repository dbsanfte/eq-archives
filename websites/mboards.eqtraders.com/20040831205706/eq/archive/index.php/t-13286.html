222 INT<br />

400 combines, 96 successes, 4 skill-ups<br />

The RNG owes me.  :)   At least it's another 3K plat or so in my pockets once I sell them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try to get some more gear to get your Int up.<br />
<br />
That will help quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at 255 int i had at least 2 and i think 3+ stretches of 100 combines per skillup.  i ended up at about 40 combines per skillup.  i have a thread on it too.  :D<br />
<br />
the rng owes nobody.  it balances with all the otherr ppl in eq.  my 40 combines per skillup were offset by a friend who went 15 combines per skillup the whole way and had 255 int too.  i do this beacuse i like it no matter how much abuse it gives me.  :)  that and its still better than xp grinding alone though quadding keeps you from falliing asleep at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep plugging away at it.  It does take some work.  I wish I had saved the data for the skill ups I got.  I did runs of 400 and 600 at a time, though.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you, and may you soon be weilding that shiny new spoon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If it's any consolation, this past two weeks I went two runs of 600 each with only one skillup total between the runs. Then last night another run and *whammo* I get 5 skillups and sell about 300 pies inside of 5 minutes in trader. It's all good. And at least I won't starve. :)</div></div><hr />

Do PoP combines -&gt; Jord meat pie is rediculously easy and I averaged about 1.1 skill ups per stack of meat.  <br />
<br />
Hmm... The only other post I could find by Bzarth (the thread starter) contains this line... (posted on 12/19/03)<br />
<br />
Started doing them with INT of 173 when my skill was 190 (I couldn't look at another Pinemyer Pasta  ). I've since gone up in level (so I can get KEI) and have INT gear that I swap in, so I do my combines with 225 INT now. <br />
<br />
I doubt that someone who was just level 45 the middle of last month will be collecting STACKS of Jord Meat anytime soon. Though they do mention doing some candied cockroaches, in their other post, as well as JaggedPine items, so they seem to understand that there are other recipes.<br />
<br />
One skill up in 100 seems pretty low. But 31 in 1600 seems only a LITTLE low. 1 in 50, starting at 190 instead of 200, sounds quite a bit familiar to the 1 in 40 people seem to average from 200 to 220. And near the top at 240+ lots of people report one skill up in 20 on average. (much like the Jord Pies you mention)<br />
<br />
Plus if the run nets him 3k in plat I'd say it's time well spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">most pop drops are either as expensive for parts as the final product or so expensive with a low success rate its not worth it.  mtps even a few sell back for most of your money.  all you have is time spent.  you also only need about 200pp to get a big run instead of 4k for some of the other recipes.  (jfp the fruit is 50pp in bazaar and then pp for CE's.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
934 combines, 26 skill ups so far. Current skill 217.<br />
<br />
That would be just shy of 36 attempts per skill up at 255 WIS.<br />
<br />
My longest run without a skill up is 126, and I have 2 more runs in the 90s. I'm keeping track of it all and will post it once I hit 250. :)</div></div><hr />
