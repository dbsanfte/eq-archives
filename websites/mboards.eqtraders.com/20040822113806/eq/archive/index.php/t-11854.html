<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know its a quest but has anyone every tried making it anyway?  he says the rest of the stuff is harvested locally and he has an oven right there.  how hard woud it be to go through everthying he sells and forages there.  very small list compared to the other stuff we're doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem is sea dragon meat.  Only Kelorek`Dar in CS and Faydedar in TD drops it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah and its prolly **** pricey.  reward is 18 wis 20 sta all/all item.  just wondering if its possible.  wasn't planning on making a bunch of it.  faydedar has been taken by 3 lv 65 peeps so if you are bored and have tradeskilling friends and really high its an option.  if the item can be used in another quest though it might still be cool.  or a really really good stat food.  something like +10 all stats, svs, 50 hp/mana, and ft3.  that would be awesome enough food to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorvari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">More likely he is talking about Sea Dragon Steaks, or Water Dragon Steaks, but I don't think the recipes for those are known at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">quest from alla's (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=960) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bloogy Shellcracker says 'The rarest treat I can prepare for my people is saucy salted seadragon steak. I wish to barter for some water dragon or sea dragon meat, saltwater seaweed, and fish eggs. The rest of the ingredients are collected locally by our collectors. <br />
<br />
More than likey just a story-line...but all means, start experimenting.  But AFAIK nobody has tried formulating a list of possible components.</div></div><hr />
