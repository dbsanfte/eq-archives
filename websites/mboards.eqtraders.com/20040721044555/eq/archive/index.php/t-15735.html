<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>djpoobah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone ever figured out how to &quot;Blood-treat&quot; them?<br />
I know a recipe was found when the tradeskill UI was all messed up....  and called for blood-treated kaniz hides<br />
<br />
But has anyone figured out how to make those?<br />
Maybe combining with war wraith blood in some ratio?<br />
Or some other blood?<br />
Maybe it needs a another item to make the combine?<br />
<br />
Any help be greatly appreciated..<br />

you need to get to the southern most part of the zone and start killing tormentors (not slowable and summon) then make way upstairs on southernmost building. (bring a monk bard etc to lull one of the 2 door guards on each set of guards before the stairs). Work you way up to top of stairs and attack the named yellow  con guy... starts with a b forget name but its obviously him and he looks like one of the 4 mouth guys... he will proc port you into his stomach (stomach event).  Since rogues are buttwipes on stealing from the mobs in this event I suggest dropping down, clearing the 6 first drop mobs (if they see invis or keep goin if they dont and you dont want to risk dying).  On 2nd drop there are very few mobs in yer room and probably wont agro.  There are 4 mobs in this room, a couple mobs in hall, and about 5 mobs in next room.  set up camp here and clear respawns until you are blue in the face (respawn is long like 45mins or so).  Repeat until you have all the putrescent bloods you want.  This will take a lot of hours of farming.  If you can accomplish acquiring bloods, you will have no problem figuring out the rest of the combine components.</div></div><hr />

Meaning what, that you know how to do the combine and aren't sharing? Or are you just trying to look smart ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimlach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">meaning that the bloods is the hard part, and it is VERY hard to get compared to kaniz hides and foraging keen metal spikes.  the recipe is on eqtraders.  Worry about getting bloods, as I have gone thru stomach about 5x and never seen a blood.  I have gotten 2x stomach junk fer the lame jc neck tho.  There is a way better drop in GoD off natimbi yard trash that the same classes that can use kaniz neck etc are; so I really only suggest camping bloods for the burning affliction 4 item for soloing if you are a shm/nec.  Who knows tho.. someone may figure out the boruk combine and it could be really good.  We dont know at this point.  But if we get more bloods by doing event, we can find out.  BTW has anyone seen any npc or book or anything for these combines? I am rather interested in these since they are so hard to obtain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What would be nice is if SOE added an additional source of putrescent blood that isn't a triggered, raid only event.</div></div><hr />
