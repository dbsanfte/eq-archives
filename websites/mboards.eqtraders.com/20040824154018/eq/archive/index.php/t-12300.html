<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lenore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Skill 250!<br />
Started making a tally system of combines at skill of 196.  <br />
It took me 1,256 combines to go from 196 to 250, with my GM spoon created at skill 224.  Can we say &quot;Carpal Tunnel?&quot; ouchies.<br />
<br />
As for what I made for skill ups, it varied.  I am a forager so alot wasn't too hard to come by.  And having a 200 Fishing skill helped alot as well.  But, I mainly stuck with Holy Cake and I think my guildmates still shudder at the mention of the words, and scurry for cover when they see me, thinking I will foist some off onto them. <br />
I scoured the bazaar, and bought various meats.  Boar, hobgoblin, mephit, hero parts, blood raven, etc.  Didn't really stick with one type, although I did find a gold mine of brownie parts one day and that took me days to go through them all.</div></div><hr />
