<br />
They've added so many new weapon graphics...how about some new armor graphics please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delandril</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason they don't really add new armor is that it involves a lot more work and assets. To make one new chain model, you'd have to make a new model for every race, not just 1 copy of the model, since every races chain model is a little different. New weapon models, on the other hand, are much easier to do since you just make one model and it fits all characters.<br />
<br />
Probably, the easiest thing to do that would make armor look different other then the simple tinting they currently do would be to make new textures like they did for velious. However, due to the variety of armor now, and the complexity of the models, even this is a fairly daunting task...anyway, just my humble opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stryhf</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each new armor texture also adds to the global textures file loaded into memory.   As it stands, what you displayed wasn't even showing the Luclin textures, which means you've probably lowered your texture models in order to maximize  performance.<br />
<br />
Asking to have more &quot;looks&quot; added would mean longer load times, and slower performance.  I really wish they would redo some of the velious models, I always found the halfling look to be heinously ugly.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I unloaded all the Luclin models, and my initial game start went from over a minute to 10-15 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinann</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I showed velious becuase luclin is more depressing. plain.. leather.. look. If you have Rowyals you know the look I mean. Tizmak. I used a low quality save in adobe, but my system:<br />
2100 AMD<br />
GF 4Ti 4600<br />
512 DDR 333MHz RAM<br />
DVD CD ROM plus 56X DC ROM drive<br />
etc <br />
All i have on this PC are EQ and my MP3s since i raid Every Day. <br />
I have had luclin models off since release due to preferance hehe at full blown system performace on luclin you get :<br />

<br />
I'm trying to do lowbandwith saves to save load speed so Denmother does not swat me. If you have seen Tizmak It looks like this. Simple enough  :P <br />
<br />
But these are *ornate patterns from the tier 3 planes. Hopefuly they come up with something a bit more impressive for the patterns that drop in Elemental planes and Time</div></div><hr />
