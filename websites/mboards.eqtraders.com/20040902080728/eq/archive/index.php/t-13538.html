<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I am thinking of making me a Tunarean Soldier Wristguard. It has a triv of 250. Now I have a tailoring skill of 175 geerlok equipped. What would be my chances of success? I have the skills for all the subcombines just the tailoring is out of my reach. I would just buy it but they are never for sale in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe you would have a roughly 5% chance of success. If you bought enough items for 20 tries you may make 1 MAYBE 2 if you get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well....plan B then are there any wood elf gm tailors wanting to sell me one or do the combine for me on cazic? I would pay 2500 pp or 500 pp (on success)for them to make the combine for me if there are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know much of CT, but I do know of a GM Wood Elf tailor on Stormhammer, if you ever happened to that server.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
<br />
But, I don't want to turn this into a marketplace.  =D  I would say that you may want to make ribbons to 187, then get the Shears from Shei.  Bear in mind though, bracers (from my experience with the Erudite cultural) are the least successful item to make.  I think I am 1 for 15 or so...but am 4 for 7 on BPs.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I gathered enough components for 2 suits, the tailored I worked with is 250.  I ended up with 1 suit.  50% at 250.  You would most likely fail them all at 175.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Two things:<br />
<br />
1, you should read the FAQ about posting on these boards and keep &quot;WTB&quot; posts in the Marketplace forum.<br />
<br />
2, have you looked in the bazaar on your server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vovinit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry i posted outside the marketplace. I looked in the baz for a week. Seems no one wants to make them because they are low profit compared to the rest of the tunarean armor like tunic and legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Candien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Theres a Wood Elf GM Tailor on CT... uhhhhhmmm... Bren something i think :/ name slips me atm :( Its a 65 druid tho =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Check your busiest server board, or the marketplace forums here. That's the best way to find out who is able and willing to make stuff for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>zumavt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Regarding chances for success, I recall this formula from a message on the old EQTraders forums here (http://pub147.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessageRange?start=41&amp;stop=60&amp;topicID=1242.topic) <br />
, if still available:<br />
<br />
Success rate = (1.15*Skill) - (Trivial - 70) <br />
<br />
If the old boards aren't available, the formula is also mentioned on this site's home page.<br />
JC page (http://www.valendor.org/gumkak/jewelcraft.asp) <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if this formula was discovered to be untrustworthy? Seems that threads are always talking about such and such a combine has a good or bad (velious leathers come to mind) success rate  which would make any formula suspect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">all over 250 so no idea what to put in for trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Go to the general tradeskill board, and look up the 1750 thread.  It will give you a list of some of the 250 tailors.</div></div><hr />
