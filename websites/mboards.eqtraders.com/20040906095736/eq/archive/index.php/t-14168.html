<br />
Note! The NPC Esunta sells 2 different Cestus Molds! I have no clue why. One is marked &quot;Can be used in tradeskills&quot;. Are you using the one marked for tradeskills?</div></div><hr />

Umm, I think this means that the level restriction on the usage of the weapon not in creating it. The original poster had problem combining the weapon.<br />
