<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a die hard Fisherman in real life.....and I started tying my own flies in game. I will only fish with Nite Swooper Circle Flies or Busy Bee Circle Flies, etc. First they give a 4% Mod, one more than my Brell's Rod. (My Blessed Rod broke last night arrghh)<br />
Plus I think it is more exciting to make my own flies than buy the canned bait.<br />
I cannot believe I have found myself farming Bixies for their wings :)<br />
Does anyone make flies also?</div></div><hr />

Second of all, flies are a waste of time. They're used up just like bait, and the spiderling silk required to make the silk threads could be put to better uses. You can make a decent profit selling the spiderling silks in the Bazaar, or use the silk threads with low quality pelts to make leather padding and sell that.</div></div><hr />

Many people think it's a waste of resources but if you love to make and use them, more power to you.</div></div><hr />

Bah.  One could argue that all of EQ is a waste of time.  I tie my own flies.  Busy Bee Circle flies, only.  I farm my own bixies, or buy the wings off of merchants.  Not only do I do it for myslef, I give them as gifts, and everyone I give them to on guild fishing trips is amazed when they find out I make them myself.<br />
<br />
For modifiers, your best bet for economics is to get yourself a Fisherman's Companion.  The extra two percent you get from a blessed fishing rod doesn't nearly make up for the cost of busting it.  Besides, Brell's pole summons ale!!!  And, of course, you can summon another one if you break it.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and remember to drop your fly gently!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In another post one fellow said his bait modifier was NOT adding the mod it was supposed to. It was as if he had no Mod at all. The Busy Bee is supposed to add 4% mod, i havent been in game a few days......have you noticed a problem with it not adding a Mod?</div></div><hr />
