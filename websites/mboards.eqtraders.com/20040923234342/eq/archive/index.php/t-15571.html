<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>myss miou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im looking for the best player made item for tribute turn in.<br />
<br />
<br />
the best i found so far is the sharped sedgewood compoun bow (silk). <br />
http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=10053&amp;menustr=035000000000<br />
<br />
<br />
cost 90pp to make and its 345 tribute for it ( almost 4tribute per pp) but often i see those for sell at 50pp in bazaar and thats how i make my tribute, i simply buy them at 50pp and make 7tribute per pp spend.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I try a few combine to find a better ration tribute / pp but couldnt find any decent :( <br />
<br />
Anyone know a good combine to do for tribute ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats 1000:1 ratio! I WIN!<br />
<br />
Lots of drops sell for tiny fractions of what tribute masters give for them as well I wont spill all my secrets, but i find a certain short sword often for 200p in the bazaar thats worth 1853 tribute. Where that sword comes from is a good place to look for other bargains.<br />
<br />
Lots of lowbie LDON drops are very nice tribute as well.<br />
I won a Miners Girdle in a LDON adventure (8ac 8sta, thats it). Prolly couldnt get 10p for it in the bazaar but its worth 120 tribute. Shwing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most of the cultural LoY Robes have a huge tribute value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>myss miou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">too bad im a vah shir ... cant do any cultural robe :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Obina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The thing with Tempest robes is that since you can sell them for plenty of pp, the opportunity cost of using them for tribute is still high.<br />
<br />
Really cheap items might have a good ratio, but just a pest to manage<br />
<br />
So another right answer is things you can't sell for what they are worth.  Or even things you can buy for cheap.  Any item made just for skill up comes to mind.  On my server people are dumping Ceremonial Solstice Robes for as low as 45pp.  I'm going to try one as tribute.  And I vendor sold stacks of LDoN armor as I was smithing up.  Hmm I wonder if the tribute guy wants a few bags of shadowscream boots, or even all my old filleted lion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It takes a bit of farming for the heavy clay and kunzar koi but I made a bunch of tribute off of crucibles of escape.  Cost ~48pp to make and give 427 tribute.  A good way to find tribute deals is by subscribing to Alla's site and looking the items up on Lucy, members get a listing for the tribute value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are worth 30 tribute each which is better then the 2+pp you can sell them for (but not by much).</div></div><hr />

Something like that...<br />
<br />
Cultural smiths, however, have it the best I think since culturally smithed bp's garner 20k trib.<br />
<br />
Nice about the 1lb crag and tuna. Isn't that foragable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not sure about the Forrage but it is Fishable... 1cp for bait and you get the different Crab and Tuna.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Crab and tuna are fishable (crab is lootable from the crab traps under the Abysmal Sea Boat).<br />
Hynid and Cragbeast meat is foraged.<br />
<br />
The Hynid/Cragbeast meat is still worth 5g/lb or so. (and also worth 1 tribute each lb)<br />
The crab and tuna are the 1c/lb stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>myss miou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">humm since i cant make any cultural armor my best bet is the Gold Geode Ring , geode are sold for 5 - 10pp each on my server so i still make 15-20tribute per pp , not too bad.<br />
<br />
thx ofr the info.</div></div><hr />

For smithing, I like the tae ew chain leggings btw.<br />

Basically, 2 tae ew bloods + distilled mana = 10k tribute<br />

<br />
31.5 tribute per pp max  <br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?  Total cost to make is 30.5 (10.5 + 20), worth 331 tribute points.<br />
<br />
331 / 30.5 = 10.85 tribute / pp<br />
<br />
Not 31.5.  So it isn't as great a deal as you make it out to be.  Good, but not as good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just sayin'<br />
-- C.<br />
(Unless, by &quot;under 20pp&quot; you mean more like 10pp.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's free if you forage it, so it's just the cost of the gold bar.</div></div><hr />

Oak shaft 1.05p<br />
Sheet Metal 1.05p<br />
Spear head mold 9.45p<br />
Water Flask .01p<br />
<br />
Total cost 11.56p, trivial 66<br />
<br />
Tribute - priceless (JK, 240 tribute), 20.76 tribute per plat, all vendor bought ingredients, easily made in pok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Maevenniia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The gold polished quartz rings are ~660 tribute points.<br />
<br />
Deep Cavern Breastplate (swamp temper) is 299 tribute points.  There are some other LDon Breatplates worth up to ~700 points, but I forget which temper it was /sigh, need to write these things down...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hm, searching for 'forged' on Lucy came up with some interesting others....<br />

Thats 150 tribute per plat. I think we got a winnah here. Make em now before the nerf bat swangs!</div></div><hr />

I buy two stacks of bait for 1 gold, 2 silver.  Then I spend about 30 min fishing and converting and wind up with about 400-500 tribute points.  This is how I covered the Enduring Breath I needed to finish my Staff of the Wheel quest.  It may not be useful for the higher level players, but it's great where I am now.</div></div><hr />
