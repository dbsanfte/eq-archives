By Ceryn Bwahahahahahaha of the Stromm Server<br />
<br />
So you want to become a master brewer huh. Well then, you’ve come to the right place! I made this guide with the intention of making a quick, cheap, easy way to become a master brewer. I also made it so you wouldn’t have to forage or look for crappy ground spawns for 90000000 years; everything you see in here is sold by an NPC. Most of the stuff you can find in bars, personally I prefer the Felwithe bar that’s right above the brew barrel since everything is in close proximity to the barrel. The Faydwer Shaker supplies are sold in many places; East Freeport, HHP, and Halas seem to be the favorites. If you’re looking for where you can find these supplies, check the EQTC Brewing Supply Locations page. I hope you find my guide to your liking, please feel free to email any updates you’ve found to erock32@nni.com. Thanks, and enjoy!<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you have the PoP you can go to the Plane of Knowledge and make Fetid Essences until skill 122. They’re made by combining 1 Fishing Grubs and 1 Water, unsure of the container. The fishing grubs vendor is named Caden Zharik and is at loc -344, 769. You must combine in the New Tanaan Brew Barrel or it won’t work. Good luck.<br />

<br />
0-122 fetid essence<br />
122-188 faydwer shakers<br />
188-248 mino brews.<br />
<br />
Cheap, store bought, and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cattywumpus</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I would do malted milk from 0 to 26.  Why waste training points on something that you can do in 15 minutes for less than a plat.  <br />
<br />
Save those training points for someting that takes forever to raise like begging or fishing past 180.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quichon</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Catty, while I do agree that blowing 20 practices is not the best way to spend them, you may not use them to increase a tradeskill over 20.  <br />
<br />
Ceryn,  you do NOT need to use the New Tanaan Brew Barrel for Fetid Essence.  I have used this recipie back in Cabilis (Klok Foxmyr at LOC 127,-198 in East Cabilis sells the fishing grubs you need and Lybar in WEST cabilis at Loc 289,530,-9 down by the shore for the water flasks) in the brew barrel there and it worked.  This was before I purchased PoP, so I am fairly sure I didn't practice it there.  However, I agree that if you have PoP, and you aren't an Iksar, it is a much easier place to purchase your grubs.<br />
<br />
Also, the other main concern I have with your guide is almost everything you have in there needs CASKS which do NOT stack.  This gets VERY tiresome when you cannot just alt-click from stacks and have to go back to the merchant all the time.<br />
<br />
If you can forage, you can make Ginesh from 123-168.  You can also find foraged veggies for sale for cheap in the bazaar sometimes.  Everything stacks.<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
If you are on friendly terms with the Halflings, you can be on even friendlier terms by making them Jumjim Spiced Beer.  Everything is sold from NPC's in RV and everything stacks.  Beware, you may be mugged for your Jumjum Spiced Beer by thirsty Halflings.  It also trivs at 168.<br />
<br />
This allows you to totally SKIP Ol'Tujims Fierce Brew and all the time going between the brew barrel and the merchant for still more casks.<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
If you want to spend some time with the Vah Shir, you may go to Shadeweaver Thicket and pick up the groundspawns for Shar Val Essence.  This saves money, but will cost in time.  But it all stacks AND since it trivs at 187 you can skip on Faydwer's Shakers and IT'S casks too.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER<br />
<br />
There is no truly easy way to get up over 200 without the Mino Brew unless you are willing to spend THOUSANDS of plat.  <br />
<br />
So while I cannot eliminate the non-stackable casks, I can at least delay the inevitable as long as possible.  I bet I'll spend less time than you, even having to pick up ground spawns (there are almost 20 of them so per 5 mins rotation I can pick up almost a stack) than you do having to go back for more and more and more casks.  At least I can also practice my other skills while exploring the zone (safe fall, sense heading, and combat skills just to name a few) whereas you are developing Carpel Tunnel Syndrome trying to get more and more and more casks.<br />
<br />
SO, in short:<br />
<br />
1-122: Fetid Essence.  One fishing grub and one water flask. cheap and fast.<br />
<br />
123-168: Ginish (forager) or JumJum spiced beer (RV purchased)<br />
<br />
169-187: Shar Val Essence. You can also just do this from 123 on if you want<br />
<br />
188+ Mino Brew. Blech, this is the &quot;weed out course&quot; for GM brewmaster.<br />
<br />
Whaddya think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceryn</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did list the alternate route to 122 with the Fetid Essence. I'll have to change the info about the New Tanaan Brew Barrel... I was looking on the forums and someone said you needed to combine there. I like the idea about the JumJum beer, do you know how much it costs per combine? I'll add it in as an alternate route for people. I didn't add anything made with foraged goods because I want this to be a guide that doesn't require having to pickup ground spawns and forage stuff, its just a straight, easy, store bought route.<br />
<br />
P.S. About the Fetid Essences. I've found if you start something with a triv much nearer your skill level you get many more skill raises and successful combines than if you start something with a triv thats not even in the same ballpark as you. Can anyone confirm this, or is it just me being an idiot as usual?   8)  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceryn</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">P.P.S. Casks are also very light, and therefore I load up with a backpack in every slot. Thats another reason I prefer brewing in Felwithe, because the casks are right near the brew barrel along with all the brewing supplies.<br />
<br />
And I will change the malted milk to skill 1 - 26, thanks for bringing that to my attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfontes</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking as a GM brewer...<br />
<br />
Brewing guides are not needed.<br />
<br />
Anyone can do:<br />
<br />
0-122 fetid essence <br />
122-188 faydwer shakers <br />
188-248 mino brews. <br />
<br />
Like posted above by Gargazon, or any path, it is just too simple.  Mino brews will make you go insane, but it isn't brain surgery to GM this skill.<br />
<br />
Sure people will debate (i like skull ale for a bit personally), and people will point to ground spawns.  yadda yadda, there are 20 ways from sunday, each easier than the next to get to 188.  After that, good ol' mino. hehe<br />
<br />
Oh, forgot to mention, yes, DON'T waste training points on this skill, the fetid essence will add 5 minutes to your skill-up path from 0-21.  Personally I will never waste training points on tradeskills, each and every skill is easy to get to 21 (and already is), for my money it is a waste.  I will probably spend many points on upper research and fishing, but that is all I'd waste it on.</div></div><hr />

Some folks like to skill up on a variety of items, which is cool. One suggestion - Skull Ale to 151, was easy to get the skull in the Bazaar (i paid 20pp) , requires no other container, and everything stacks. <br />

I think these are the two simplest ways to get up to the dreaded MHB*<br />
<br />
Although the SV essence requires you either buy or grab the fruits, you can make money on these if you pick them up yourself. <br />
<br />
* yes, started in on this earlier in the week. right hand is about to fall off, and I am only at 198. but as I am a Brell worshipping Dwarven Cleric, I pretty much have to make brewing my first GM tradeskill, after all my alcohol tolerance was at 200 even before meditate.<br />
<br />
At least by the time I hit 248 (or whenever I give up on MHB) my alts and friends should have a few stacks of tea leaves to attempt some QAT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sir0die</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i went with the skull ale, bought the skull in bazaar for 15p, skilled up in about 15-20 minutes and later sold skull in bazaar for 75p.(there was one other for sale at 100p)<br />
<br />
passed out all the ale to guildies before a raid. They tend to like it when i show up at raids. I pass out all sorts of stuff. Look at my sig and check out my skills. They really like it when i pass out holy cakes, halas pies and MTPs.</div></div><hr />

It costs a little more but it is easy to sale and it gives me a chance not to do Hero's Brew for 60 lvls.  I was able to go from 188 to 216 ( think that was trival ) in 15 stacks of attempts.  The subcombines were no were as bad as Halas meat pie esply since the liquidized meats are portable to make.</div></div><hr />

It's not an amazingly cheap or easy combine, but nor is it that bad, and all components can be purchased. What I like about it as opposed to mino's brew, is that a) it is actualy useful to have around for you and your friends, and b) It has so far been fairly easy for me to not only recoup costs by selling, but I have managed to make several hundred extra pp as well. The fact that the liqiudised meats can be combined on the go with mixing bowl also makes for a nice bonus.<br />

Very high success rate at 200 making me need too much bank space to hold them in.  Subs are annoying as well.  I did 3 stacks iirc, and failed 2 of them.  With a yield of 6 that is 348 drinks.

 THe thing of it is not to get to GM brewer the fastest and easiest way possible, but to make all the fun brews there are in game, and have fun doing it.<br />
 If you're in the game of brewing to get to GM the fastest easiest way, you're missing the purpose of all the wondrous recipes I helped create in game.<br />
 Strangeness is fun!<br />
 Take the time, brew some strange!!<br />
 Then drink if in front of others or share with yer mates.<br />
<br />
 What I'd like to see is a tour of Norrath and the expansions brewing guide... For Good and evil...<br />
 Take the tour brew by brew, barrel by barrel...look at the recipes and plan it out for maximum different brews and fun!!<br />
<br />
 And who in their right mind would drink fetid essence? Okay Skunk ale drinkers, hmmm Tail-Kicker lager? probably same folk der too...<br />
<br />
 Gah argueing about the shortest simplest route and ye only ever brew 3 things? GAH!! Yer making me pull out me braids!!!<br />

Thanks for all the positive feedback on the guide, sorry I've been absent from the forums for so long. Got sick of being so poor on my cleric all the time so I re-started as a necro, and have been leveling hard. Just hit 54 last night, and maxed research.<br />
<br />
Still have crap gear... oh well -.- welcome to Stromm! Lol.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to reach me, I'm on a lot, my char's name is Teudayr. Drop me a line anytime, if I don't respond just spam me until I do, I frequently have bad battle spam lol.<br />
<br />
Once I hit 60 I'll add a lot more to the guide, just gotta keep up leveling so I don't get booted outta my guild hehe. Good luck to all!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xxyl</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, personally, and this takes a bit of baking skill to boot, but I went with Fetid Essence &gt; 122, Shar Vahl Essence &gt; 187, Grobb Liquidised Meat &gt; 216, THEN Mino Brew &gt; 248 and finished off with Kaladim Constitutionals &gt; 250. <br />
<br />
I will cut costs anywhere I can and Shar Vahl Essence is the cheapest combine there is to the level of Brewing. <br />
<br />
Now, I went with Grobb drinks because the success rate on them is AWESOME and despite the baking sub-combines and the slight cost on making Grobbs, with its phenominal success rate, they sell extremely well and fast in the bazaar paying for themselves and then some to further your next run of brewing (maybe even another trade too).<br />
<br />
Mino Brews are a severe PITA because the skill up rate on them isn't all that great but like everyone else said, it is a have to do drink to advance brewing unfortunately. I wanted to wait as long as I could before having to make these and Grobb's let me do that.<br />
<br />
When finishing out brewing with kaladims I highly suggest only getting enough shrooms and fungus for a single stack of combines. If you have max wis/int I doubt it will take anymore than that to GM. It took me about 14 combines I believe to GM. KCs do NOT sell very well either so you don't want to be sitting on them or the extra ingredients for forever and a day. lol<br />
<br />
I do trades because I really enjoy doing them but I do take the value of the trade into concideration because I am not a rich Cleric so need to make back my cost any chance I get. Working my way slowly to 250 in all trades and I'll get there one day! I'm such a tradeskill nut I am seriously concidering GMing all skills on one of my alts as well. :P</div></div><hr />

i did the fetid esscense to 122.<br />
skull ale to 151.<br />
went back and made 2 stacks of double brewed dwarf ale for a dwarf friend and cause i wanted too.<br />
went to 165 on fay shakers.  <br />
made 1k on 329 heady kiolas.  used the bottles from the shakers and drank one to keep going.<br />
shar vhal esscense to 186.  its not only cheap it made me money.  about 50pp on it made from skilling and running around.  can get 28 fruit per circuit in shade weaver's.  other ppl started picking it up before i got there last night so stopped and used what i had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meryddian</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to level several skills at once - as a result I'm not necessarily going the &quot;fastest&quot; route but one that gives me easy skill-ups in conjunction with making me dyes/tempers for my 190+ smithing/tailoring:<br />
<br />
If you are trying to raise several skills at once - particularly if your race is capable of cultural tailoring on robes, or you're a smith - you can make your own tempers, and raise your brewing and smithing skills together:<br />
<br />
Are youplaying in LDON a lot? Then add tempers to the &quot;quick&quot; list. The recipe is simple - <br />
<br />
(ingredient) + water = temper, trivial at 127 or less. <br />
(ingredient) = sand verbena, gargoyle granite, goblin bones, pondweed, ice lichen<br />
<br />
Working on Velious smithing? Brew velium temper:<br />
Coldain heater = allspice, brown algae, shotglass, water flask (all store-bought, trivial 156)<br />
Coldain velium temper = celestial essence(4), coldain heater (trivial 136)<br />
<br />
Able to cultural smith? Brew dyes - which is especially good for forage classes/races!:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=180&amp;rsa=Brewing&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=dye&amp;menustr=080030035000<br />
<br />
Vials of prismatic dye are trivial at 68, all store-bought items, and you can easily sell them in the bazaar to coup your cash back and then some!<br />
<br />
Even if you are not working tailoring/smithing yourself, you can always find buyers for your racial dyes and LDON tempers. Due to these recipes nicely filling the 160ish-220ish tradeskill gaps, they are quite heavily in demand and I find I get quick skill-ups on them. I am also brewing Ice Wine, made with Stunted Arctic Roots (new forage in the EF dungeons, I believe) which is giving me a nice set of skill-ups and produces a weak sow potion which I give away to newbies.</div></div><hr />
