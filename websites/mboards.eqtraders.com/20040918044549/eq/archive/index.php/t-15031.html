The Bazaar is your friend.  Go there and see what is selling.  Leather padding, spider silk, and other tradeskill subcomponents sell well to us crazy tradeskillers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoghnved</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just picked up LDoN about a week ago, and I've been getting some decent amounts of platinum in the adventures.  This all depends on what level you are, though.  If you're still around 8 to 10 I'd hunt Grikbar Kobolds in Steamfont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silverfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Frankly, I understand Splunge's response.  The question does seem to be asking for an easy way to rake in the dough (by the clumps, if you're a punster) and there is no &quot;easy&quot; way.  That said, these are the easier ways to get your bank balance moving if you're destitute and patient.  Take note that this is a farming guide, not a tradeskill guide, since it sounds like you're new to the world of tradeskills, and it's devilishly tough to turn a profit with only low level tradeskills.  For more help with tradeskill cash-making, check the skill-specific forums on the site.  This will help you get some platinum to get started on those paths, though.<br />
<br />
Levels 1 to 5: Forget it for now.  Concentrate on getting experience, since nothing at this level pays well reliably.  Preferentially fight spiderlings and skeletons (spiderling silks do sell well, and bone chips can sell or be used for turnins to get levels faster), but you're not going to get rich on them, so kill anything non-green that crosses your path to get experience.<br />
<br />
Levels 6-14: Green goblins and wandering Greenbloods in Butcherblock are good cash cows, although they're virtually perma-camped.  Also, going to Crushbone at this level won't yield tons of cash, but it'll get you some, while helping you level up even higher.  At this point, start watching the Bazaar for low end stuff, like spider silks (score these off spiders in most newbie zones), spiderling silks, animal pelts and such.  That way you'll know what to sell to vendors, and what to put up for sale in the Bazaar.  Also, although it's not a plat-maker, you'll save a lot of cash if you do the quests for your race/class newbie armor, so you don't have to buy decent gear to start out.<br />
<br />
Level 15-24: The bandit camps near the Shadow Haven zone line in the Paludal Caverns.  Again, they're heavily camped, but if you can get into a group you'll almost always leave with more than you can carry in loot to sell.  Pay close attention to what sells for how much, so you know to drop that sullied long sword to pick up the bronze brigandine pants, for example.<br />
<br />
Level 25-35: Your options are much wider now, but for raw cash with low risk and low likelihood of camping, go to the Gorge of King Xorbb.  The minotaurs drop blood and axes worth 3 pp each, and the evil eyes, while challenging at 25-30, give good experience and drop gems and words almost constantly.  Read up on the zone for strategic tips, or you'll be farming ass-kickings instead of gems.<br />
<br />
Levels 36-45: The Dreadlands make a great zone to level up in, and lots of very valuable loot drops here.  You'll be splitting it with a party (at 36-45, soloing here is difficult for the best of us), but enough goes down that you'll still be able to fill your bags on most nights.  Be sure to check all of your loot in the Bazaar, since some stuff that drops here will sell very well to other players (like HQ brute hides).  Another good place for cash at this level is the fortress area in Gunthak, or the boats in Dulak Harbor.  Both places are tough to get to, and tough to fight in, but the gems drop hard and fast, and the weapons and other gear sell for decent change as well.<br />
<br />
Levels 46-55: Lots of folks go to the Planes of Power for experience at this point, and the loot there is good.  But for raw cash value, no place beats Old Sebilis at this level.  Bring your own group, and do your homework before you go, and you'll lug some awesome gear out of there.<br />
<br />
Level 55 and over: The world is your oyster for farming at this level, and if you get this high and still have money troubles, then you're spending too much ;).<br />
<br />
Good luck, and good loot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Clarine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, <br />
<br />
 I wouldn't recommand it for the fun of it, but if it is really easy money you are looking for, and not XP at all, there is a way. <br />
<br />
At medium to high level, a lot of chars don't have enough place in their bags or not enough strenght for heavy loads, while farming or even hunting.  Ruined Pelts usefull only when skilling up are often let rotting, even fine weapons are left on the ground. So if you go to a zone way higher level than yours, run everywhere, cast/sing find corpse and wait to be able to loot corpse, you can do higher money than average at your level.<br />
<br />
Better to know how to run and to hide though, so depending of your class it might be more or less practical.  Better to have a find corpse sing or spell, too.<br />
<br />
I thought several time about this but never needed enough money, as my adoptive father Kroghleulai was very generous with me in my times of need, and as now I am making enough money. It wouls be boring too, as you would not only not win any XP, but even loose some as you will ineluctabily get beaten once in a while.<br />
<br />
Alternately,  farming some spiderlings silks in the field of Bones and sell them in the Bazaar would more safe!</div></div><hr />

Just to note, this is not supposed to be negative in any way. I'm more fascinated by this train of thought.... I'm in the process of learning my 3rd language, and it's very interesting to look at how people construct sentences in non-native languages. <br />

It's been a while since someone has used a word on a message board that I flat out don't know. Where did you learn English? For how long? What kinds of settings (ie, grade-high school, higher education, post-grad commercial lessons)? What's your first language? <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
erm, yeah, this wasn't a derail... plat... <br />
<br />
<br />
My advice is: either become a 'supplier' of lower goods -- silk swatches/threads, pelts, magic clay, foraged goods --  or do what Brodybeard said: Kill, loot, sell. Neither way is particularly fast, but EQ wasn't meant to be fast, for a variety of reasons that I won't go into atm ^_^. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In Jinxy's defense: EQ is very hard to get started in, when you're new and know no one, and no one is willing to give you 10p even for food or spells or boxes, much less gear. Everyone has to start somewhere. Yes, it's irritating to see the 'hand stuff to me' mentality, but sometimes it just /looks/ like that. <br />

<br />
No problem asking questions, it's how we get answers!  But please realize that a tradeskillers we are more accustomed to inventive and creative ways of *losing* plat.  As several have said, find what common items sell well to us tradeskillers, and hunt critters that drop such items and sell them in the bazaar.  You will become much richer, much quicker, than trying to grandmaster a tradeskill so you can sell items that go for tens of thousands of plat.<br />
<br />
An example, you can get generally 5 stacks of spiderling silk in Feerrot in an hour. (Haven't done this for a while, so it might be off) Selling the threads at the fabulously low price of 3pp each, that is 300pp an hour.  15 hours a week doing that, and you are bringing in 4500pp a week selling spiderling silks!  Small, steady profits are how you build a fortune in this game.</div></div><hr />

The twelfth anniversary of his death is about three weeks away (April 6).  I still remember when I heard the news; I was in my very low teens at the time, sitting in my living room messing about with Legos with a friend, another huge Asimov fan.  We were both kind of stunned and in shock when we heard the news on the radio.<br />

I disagree with this.  I made very good cash (for the level, anyway) selling spiderling silks to higher-level players for 1-5pp each.  A very nice high-level tradeskiller (though I didn't realize this latter fact at the time) came to East Commons, buffed all of us newbies (and I was literally a newbie, having played for maybe a week or two tops), and bought all the spiderling silk we could farm for 2pp each.  I was in awe; I was sure he would run out of cash when I told him I had a whopping ten silks!  How could anyone afford 20pp?!  :D <br />
<br />
Anywho, don't discount spiderling silks.  If you're tradeskill inclined, make them into silk threads (two spiderling silks in any sewing kit or a loom, no-fail combine) and you can probably sell them to lazy tradeskillers for a premium.</div></div><hr />

To make a small fortune, you must start with a large fortune (or something like that)<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Other than that, sell what sells well in the bazaar, there are basics that always sell,<br />
<br />
Leather paddings,  sillks, silk swatches, silk threads etc..<br />
<br />
Also, find a little market that no one takes the time to do, and go into that one, I started an enchanter for fun, then realized that vials of vicious mana are rarely for sale in the bazaar, along with large blocks of magic clay.  (This has changed since I started this).<br />
<br />
Look at core components, and the basics.  Look to take the pain away, someone who wants to PL a tradeskill may shell out the extra cash for items like rings, studs, boning etc.<br />
<br />
You will not make aninstant fortune, but it can be a steady income for the work.  Also, all servers are different, what sells well on one server may not sell at all on another.  Expirement.</div></div><hr />

Lilosh, this is hard to do if you don't know what work there is to do. I missed out on the fishing bonanza in the Abyssal sea, the plat games of the summer, silvered weapon selling, and every other get rich quick scheme of which almost everyone else seems to have taken advantage. <br />
<br />
As a result, I am perpetually poor and can only dream of the day when I finally get my smithing or tailoring up above 200. I can understand Jinxy's frustration. I am sick of being poor and SOE seems to be doing everything they can to keep me that way. :mad: <br />

<br />
If it's not something you can still do, it doesn't fall in the category of &quot;working&quot; for the plat.  There's plenty of tradeskill ways to make plat that don't involve taking advantage of massively overpriced vendor buying prices.  You just have to apply common sense.</div></div><hr />

The reason that Everquest has gone downhill is because they changed it from a world into a game.<br />

It's no longer an expansive, awe-inspiring journey into a world that you can submerse yourself into.   You're no longer plunged headfirst into your characters shoes.<br />
<br />

Now it's all about firing up the game, getting to the action NOW, playing for 15 minutes, getting the powerup and winning the game.<br />

<br />
I farm Nurga and Droga.  It's fast and easy at 65, and in Droga you get some AA too.  Cash and cash gem loot isn't bad, and you get quest item drops that you can sell for more cash.  I made enough plat there to buy ALL of my spec and rune spells AND fund getting baking, brewing, fletching, JC, and pottery into the 190's and tailoring to 158, with enough left that I will *probably* be able to get tailoring and smithing into the 190's and tinkering over 200 if I'm willing to do a lot of my own farming (which I am).<br />
<br />
I know folks who recommend Sebilis (lots of cash gems), and I can't say they're wrong.<br />
<br />
I think patience and getting to 65 is the ticket to being able to make significant amounts of plat in EQ.  But if you want big plat for little effort, mmm, I think you're going to be disappointed unless you have very, very good dice luck in places like BoT.</div></div><hr />

Being able to leave my character in the Bazaar overnight was key to my success.  It wasn't a quick process, but still quite effective.<br />
<br />
I had an enchanter and did the Stein of Moggok several times.  It used to sell for 200p, which is a lot for a level 16 character.  I don't know if it is still a popular item though.  It should be even easier to do now with PoP portals (I used to hire a druid to port me a few places).<br />
<br />
After you save up some money, start making Vials of Viscous mana.  Only enchanters can make them and they are required for skilling up (in tailoring I think it is).  They sold pretty well back when I was in the market.  Should still sell well now.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you always have enough money to make 4 stacks at a time.  Don't go spending all your earnings on a new toy, save up some money first.<br />
<br />
I forget what I moved on to after that, but it was a great start.  It paid for the early trade skill supplies.<br />

First, you have the group of people who stated playing less than 1.5 years ago (Luclin launch time?).  Most of these people are teenagers to low 20 year olds.  They're playing style is also PL as much as possible, fly up the levels, and get to the top level asap.<br />
<br />
Second, you have the people who have been playing 2+ years, Kunark and Velious are expansions to them.  Suprisingly, these people are high 20s to mid 30s.  They also tend to do the quests, work on their character devolopment, <br />
<br />
This is not intended to offend anyone, but it's what I've noticed.</div></div><hr />

Folks these days don't see the content that is in the game, it's newbie zone till low teens, PDC, HHK, OT, Dreadlands, then PoP... that's it.  Anyone remember the Oasis of Mar? EMPTY zone now.<br />
  <br />
<br />
If it wasn't for LDoN, so would NRo and SRo, except for the occasional JBoots hunter.<br />
<br />
Commonlands are empty, RunnyEye is full of crickets (every time I go there, all the named are up), SplitPaw, BlackBurrow.<br />
<br />
Great and fun zones are now collecting dust.  :(<br />
<br />
Who rememebrs when Karana was the place to hunt 20+?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Furyrpied</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Heh, i remember fighting over Aviaks and Gnoll spire camps in the Karanas... Great exp, good loot for the level.  Only folks in there now? ones who are soloing with LFG up waiting for an LDoN. Oh, who am I kidding, they all sit in PoK or at a wayfarer camp with LFG on....<br />
<br />
As per the observation above, I fit into the older crowd.  I am 31 this year (/sigh) and I would have to agree with the observations made in that post.  Not that all 'younger' players are like what was described, but with SOE taking over.. it has become a &quot;come play everquest! Grind up to level 65 with tonns of AAs in under a month! Replay value? Sure! Do it again with a twink alt!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hell.... how long after Gates of Discord did you see your first level 65 bezerker? a week?<br />
<br />
Bah-humbug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
33 here.. and took me a year to reach 65, and epic, and gm in 2 tradeskills... still working on others... <br />
<br />
No, I haven't seen all of the zones yet, but I am working on them... I also enjoy doing quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luclin launch was just before Christmas 2001.<br />
<br />

<br />
Check the news archive link to get the year.<br />
<br />
I don't get nostalgic for spending a significant portion of my play time running across the Karanas or looking for a port.  I don't think BB, Runnyeye or Splitpaw are &quot;great zones.&quot;  Personally if splitpaw collected dust forever with the #$%#$% endless mana healers healing through walls and pathing that redefines suck it wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit.<br />
<br />
RE has been revamped since it was first made (and it didn't impress me before or after the revamp except for cash farming).<br />
<br />
I'd be hard pressed to come up with a better zone than Veksar.  That's not true - it's the best-made zone in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Quinner Sparrowhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I'm an oddity (No, Liosh, I didn't say odd! :p ) I'm 36 and only started playing in June of 2002. I have yet to have one character reach 65. I'm too much of a dillitante and tend to play different alts instead of focusing on leveling Quinner like I should be doing.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree with those who wax nostalgic for the &quot;good old days&quot; that players were some how better back then. I have friends who played since shortly after launch and would listen to their stories of evercamping, guild fights over raid spots, rampant kill-stealing, HELL LEVELS, xp exploits, and programming bugs. It was because of this and bad stories about hacking on Diablo that I resisted playing EQ for so long. (I didn't know that EQ was relatively immune to the hacking other MMORPG's suffered from in the early days.)<br />
<br />
The are many aspects of the game that are better now, especially in terms of programming bugs. Bards are only broken every other patch and casks now stack. For the game world to continue, new blood must be attracted to it.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 coppers worth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah! I'll have you know I'm much higher than mid-30's!  My highest is level 55!<br />
<br />
<br />
(Okay, Okay - You're right. Created first character October 7, 1999.  The other poster about old players not necessarily being better players is also correct. I suck at everything except making pp.)  :D <br />
<br />
To drag this back to the original topic - Studying this site to learn what tradeskill items and raw materials are in demand, then staying logged in to the bazaar 24/7 is the best way to make pp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
30 and my highest ever is 53 now.  3 servers, several re-rolls.<br />
<br />
Been on for over 4 years now. (Yes, I prefer other things to levelling).</div></div><hr />

 <br />
not the epic in 3 days... (3 days from GoD launch at least)<br />
<br />
The Epic took about 3 weeks for the first one to apear.  (right after a patch amazingly...  people think the last step was broke until that patch)</div></div><hr />
