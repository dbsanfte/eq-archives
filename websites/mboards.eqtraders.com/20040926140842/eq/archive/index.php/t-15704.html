<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ixiola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been looking for an item with Improved Healing IV for my level 63 Cleric.  I checked on augments in LDON, but there are apparently none for this focus item, so I decided I had 2 main choices to get this focus:  either ornate plate sleeves or a Ceramic Totem of the Rathe.  On my server, I had heard that the sleeves molds run at 80K+...assuming you can find one which I hadn't been able to do.  And since my current sleeves are clockwork observer, they are pretty good as it is.<br />
<br />
The other choice was the totem.  Since I just finished shawl 8 a week ago, my ranged slot no longer was sporting the Ceramic shield of Valor when hunting and seemed like a good spot to upgrade.  I'm in a small family guild, so don't have elemental planes access, nor expect to any year soon.  As a result, I could either just buy a totem in the bazaar (for 60K), or look for the supplies in the bazaar and try to make one myself.<br />
<br />
I waffled a bit after pricing everything for 2 weeks, as the supplies to make a totem run 40K+.  Do I buy the totem, buy the supplies, or wait to see if an ornate sleeve mold shows up.  Finally, I made the plunge and purchased everything I needed for a combine.<br />
<br />
Put it all on my potter, and prayed to the RNG god.  Oh my god, this is a 40K combine.  /e Bites her nails.  Oh please, oh please...<br />
<br />
Click.<br />
<br />
Woohoo!!!  I succeeded!  Okay, calm down, can still fail on the fireing...<br />
<br />
Click.  WOOOOOOOOOOOT!<br />
<br />
My cleric is now a proud owner of a Ceramic Totem of the Rathe.  :D <br />
<br />
/e does the snoopy dance.</div></div><hr />
