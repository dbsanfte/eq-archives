<br />
Last night I was lagging so very badly inside of Sol Ro.  Before the patch I didn't have an issue.  <br />
<br />
Read that maybe it's because of the Guild Management Tool/Cartography System.  Or because of my Firewall.  Has anybody else experience this problem?<br />
<br />
I just do not comprehend why I hardly lag one night and then lag like crazy the next night.  ya ya, you might say it's because of EQ. :P But would appreciate any helpful tips!<br />
<br />
Thanks all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The definition hardly seems constant with the EQ community. <br />

<br />
<br />
Took this off my guild's site:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oddly enough, every time I zone into an elemental plane now my FPS rate grinds to a screeching halt unless I reload my UI.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying to find out the soure link for the above qoute...but how could a UI cause lag?  And why would reloading it *fix* the problem?<br />
<br />
Stuff like this always bug me  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt it would be your firewall unless it was somehow slowing up your send/receive o_O<br />
<br />
Fps lag...try turning your vertical sync off and make sure your mip map detail is best performance? (display properties -&gt; advanced -&gt; your video card -&gt; direct 3d and opengl) Though I'm not sure what eq uses, maybe those will help a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimphe Wildwood</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Appreciate the help Lonewylfe.  <br />
<br />
I reloaded my UI last night, and guess what...it actually worked!  Brought back my *normal* FPS.<br />
<br />
Spoke to a CS this morning and the Rep. suggested that I take it one step further and do the following:<br />
<br />
delete the uifiles folder, eqclient.ini, eqgfx_dx8.dll, and any other character name files that start with UI_name of character_##.ini<br />
<br />
Afterwards, repatch, and go into game.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried this yet.  Posting this as a FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cubwynn</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem with that solution is that you lose all of your personalized settings...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lonewylfe</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And any custom ui's, but it'll definitely make sure all the files are clean on your end...<br />
Have you done the option that does a deep scan on all files when you first start it up?<br />
But really, if reloading worked and it's still all good, I wouldn't mess with it :)<br />
Glad to help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lonewylfe - I'll try that as well.  Haven't deleted the files yet, still hoping it's something on SOE's end.  The *only* problem with reloading your UI is that you'll need to do it every time you log in (or go LD) and/or take a death.   :evil:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Der Fezzen</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I noticed that helps a lot is to just ALT + ENTER into Windowed EQ and back to Non-Windowed. This usually clears up any sort of video lag I'm experiencing. Probably the same effect as reloading your UI, but may take a bit less time.<br />
<br />
*shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just now seeing this thread but here's a few sugguestions: <br />
<br />
* FPS &quot;lag&quot; can be caused by a large number of factors, some of which may seem un-related to video performance. <br />
  1. Available memory/texture cache on your video card.  When you run out, you must swap to regular ram, and that will be somewhat slower.  To help with this, reduce the texture quality in your EQ settings.   I use medium, never high. <br />
  2. The resolution settings of your display.  If you're pushing the upper limits of your monitor to get more on screen, you will get a smaller number of FPS. <br />
  3. Drivers - If you're using the default drivers for your video card, or you're using drivers which are &quot;sub-optimal&quot; you will get a lower FPS.  Check to make sure you're using the most recent or the best performing set of drivers for your video card. <br />
  4. Check your custom UI.  Is it generating errors?  There is a file in the main EQ directory called &quot;UIErrors.txt&quot;.  If that has errors in it, other than ones stating it was getting a file from the default directory, you could be taking an FPS hit due to problems with your UI. <br />
  5. Minor file corruption.  This happens for all sorts of applications, but ones like EQ show it more often.  A full patch/probe all files option will help here. <br />
<br />
Anyway, that's all I can think of off the top of my head, other sugguestions here are also good. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cadariel</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ACK.. I'm wondering if this is my problem? <br />
<br />
Recently I upgraded from a celeron 400 (256 mb of ram) to a AMD Athlon XP 2.0g with 1g of ram.  <br />
<br />
Since the upgrade, I've noticed HORRIBLE frame rate loss. I mean, I can't even turn around... and it didn't seem to be zone specific.  When I first did the upgrades, I logged in, everything looked beautiful.  Subsequent logins seemed to have some sort of percentage chance for decent framerate for a period of time (then it degenerated) or crappy FR from the start.  <br />
<br />
I haven't messed with custom UIs, and thought that the problem was my video card (a quite dated GeForce 2 MX) simply couldn't handle the new speedy motherboard and processor. <br />
<br />
I may try this tonight, as EQ is pretty much unplayable the way things are now; with all options turned off, clip plane to 0, and everything else I can think of. <br />
<br />
I do have a new video card on the way; but I was hoping to turn my old box into a second system.  Guess we'll see what happens. <br />
<br />
<br />
(and the spellchecker here is odd... it changed I'm to i'm. O.o )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimphe Wildwood</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lothay - Thanks, I'll have to check that UIError.<br />
<br />
Cadariel - Good luck on figuring what your problem is and that it gets fixed.  <br />
<br />
I'm still having to /loadskin whenever I zone and/or die in an Elemental Plane.  Wish there was a fix.  Seen so many other players over on the EQ Tech Board having the *exact* same problem I have.  :(</div></div><hr />
