<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok this is for the real life Fishermen and women. I noticed that the fish that hang on the line on the fishing platform in Abysmal Sea look like Freshwater Fish. I thought one looks like a Largemouth Bass and one looks like a Crappie.<br />
Has anyone noticed this? <br />
I was mentioning this because why can't the graphics of the fish we catch look like those fish. The fish we catch generally look like the standard old world fresh fish, with an occasional color variation.<br />
Would it be that hard for Sony to change the graphics on fish we catch and make the graphics unique to the different zones we fish in, instead of just changing the names of the fish? Instead of just changing the color of the fish we catch, how hard would it be for Sony to change the size of the fish like the ones hanging in Abysmal Sea. Make the size vary. If they could do it for the fish hanging there....is it a huge change to do it for the ones we catch?</div></div><hr />
