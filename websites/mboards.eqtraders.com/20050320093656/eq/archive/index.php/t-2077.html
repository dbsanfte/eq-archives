I know you really hate to talk about the cost for running this site, but I really don’t think YOU should be paying for it. Your time is more than enough of a sacrifice, you shouldn’t be losing money too.<br />
<br />
So if you are spending ANY of your own money on the site, let us know because that should not be happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People on this board signing up to use racknine has been a big help :)<br />
<br />
The only thing I would like is to get a copy of Dreamweaver MX...  that is about $150 (upgrade we have dreamweaver 4) because there is a PHP plugin for MX<br />
<br />
And please no talk about pirated copies of Dreamweaver... if I wanted a PIrated copy, I would alreasy have it... I know a few places where I could get one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Docc</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I look at it a little different.  I think there should be enough in the site fund that $150 for needed software could be bought. There should be enough to cover the extra charges if there is a very busy month.  There should be enough to cover upgrading servers/services. etc<br />
<br />
This is not a paid plug or anything. I just realize HOW much I rely on this site for all my tradeskills. Think what it would be like if there was no site like this. You would spend $19.95 on a tips book in a heartbeat, and the book would be outdated in no time.<br />
<br />
If you doubt how much you use the site, go a week without looking stuff up or using printed copies from this site.</div></div><hr />
