<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drahcir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I actually made a ton of these with my warrior when Velious first came out and they were not level restrictive at all.  I haven't looked recently, but I think I will after seeing this post.  It will totally SUCK if its only level 60 usable now.</div></div><hr />

My lvl 51 paladin has been making  Vials of Velium Vapors for a while without any problems - is there another Thurg Gate potion i.e. one that's not used in the shawl quest ?<br />
<br />
If there isn't then this just screwed up my 4th shawl for another 9 levels  :grumpy:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tweedledea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chill, guys :)<br />
<br />
- The supposed level restriction of 60 has been on the 'vial of velium vapours' for a looong time. Every now and then someone notices it and comes here in a panic to post about it. *The 'restriction' does not mean it can't be used until level 60.*<br />
<br />
- There has been no change, therefore *your ability to do the shawl quest is unaffected.*<br />
<br />
- There are other gate potions made by shamans, I'm not familiar with the cities they'll take you to.<br />
<br />
ttfn  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drahcir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just logged on with my warrior that has had one on him for a couple of years now (just recently came back to EQ).  It doesn't show a level restriction on it (heheh funny eh?).  I think I will keep it and not use it (not playing him anymore) just for a laugh.  <br />
<br />
Well its good to know that at least it can be used by everyone.  I'd hate it if I couldn't use it until then.</div></div><hr />

Those are priced in bazaar from 160 - 300 pp each.  Thurgadin Quest potion is essentially free, or 10-20pp if you need to buy the parts, so its quite a good bargain for almost anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drahcir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is the level restriction actually ON the velium vapor item or is it just something that was in a patch message?  The main reason I ask is because I just made one last night with my character and it doesn't show one on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Incidently, on the Shaman-made gate potions: dont buy anything but a 10-dose. 1 dose potions are a waste of plat. 5 doses potions are as well just not as bad.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
(assumption is 300p per dose)<br />
<br />
10 dose. 3000p spent. Use 9 doses. Sell the last dose to a vendor for 1900+p.(!!) 1100p spent for 9 gates.  Thats 120ish plat per gate.<br />
<br />
5-Dose. 1500p spent. You can use 4 doses and sell the last one back, but the ratio is worse, and thus it costs more per gate then a 10 dose. (Dont know the exact figures, never made any before).<br />
<br />
1-dose. When you use it, its gone. 300p spent.<br />
<br />
If you want to spend big plat, then buy those 1-dose insta-gate Vial of Swirling Smoke from NPC vendors. If yer cheap, go camp the Lizard gate potions from outside Cazic Thule in Feerot. =)</div></div><hr />
