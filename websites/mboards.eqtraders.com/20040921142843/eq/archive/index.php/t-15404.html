<br />
The other night I was invited out for a night with &quot;the girls.&quot; I told my husband that I would be home by midnight, &quot;I promise!&quot; <br />
<br />
Well, the hours passed and the champagne was going down way too easy. Around 3a.m., drunk as a skunk, I headed for home. Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall started up and cuckooed 3 times. <br />
<br />
Quickly, realizing my husband would probably wake up, I cuckooed another 9 times. I was proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution (even whensmashed), in order to escape a possible conflict with him.<br />
<br />
The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, and I told him 12:00. He did not seem disturbed at all. Whew! Got away with that one! Then he said, &quot;We need a new cuckoo clock. &quot;When I asked him why, he said, &quot;Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said,&quot;oh @#%$,&quot; cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another 3 times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then tripped over the cat and farted.</div></div><hr />
