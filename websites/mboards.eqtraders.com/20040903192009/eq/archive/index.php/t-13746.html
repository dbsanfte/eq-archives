<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faelorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It has come to a point where it is difficult for me to read these message boards any longer.<br />
<br />
They have gone from the most informative message boards with helpful people on it to a bunch of elitest {folks} who seek only to help themselves and discourage any others.<br />
<br />
Its old and it tired and I don't see it changing anytime soon. I miss the days when people enjoyed doing their tradeskills and sharing their information with others who enjoyed doing the same. <br />
<br />
The bitter attitudes of some have really ruined the environment for me.<br />
<br />
Why is it folks seem to feel the need to exclaim at the top of their lungs that all change is bad? Why do they not want to foster the community that fostered them?<br />
<br />
{edited by Ngreth... consider yourself warned... I am not being elitist when I enforce the &quot;no attacks&quot; rules on our boards.  It is posible to make your point without being insulting.}</div></div><hr />

It's not that I'm an elitist... it's that I don't have as much time as I used to.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I'm a Moderator for the Baking forum... which is generally one of the nicest places I've ever Mod'ed for. :angel: <br />
<br />
There were &quot;elitists&quot; back as far as the day then made Sheets of Metal stack.<br />

<br />
Probably because most of us have seen the result of a lot of previous changes to tradeskills, and have a general idea how the ebb and flow of the tradeskill market goes. <br />
<br />
And, to counter your question,  Why is it folks seem to feel the need to exclaim at the top of their lungs that all change is good?   Change for it's own sake is not a good thing.   Positive, well thought out change is good.    Hastily done, poorly-thought-out change is bad.<br />
<br />
Above all,  if you genuinely feel like the boards here are filled with &quot;Elitest {folks}&quot;  who are selfish, and ruin the fun for you,    Then I think utilizing the door would be more productive then insulting all of us.<br />

I have been around for 3 years now and I'm still loving this board. Even if I'm only reading the PSR these days it still keeps me entertained!<br />
<br />
Yea really!<br />
<br />
Oh and one more thing, whoever keeps writing &quot;jerk&quot; at the back of my robe could you please stop it? It's my only robe and my undead servant getting tired of washing it ok? Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Us ?  I think thats bad form to try and speak for everyone.<br />
<br />
If you make a thread, or join one and posters are (in your opinion) being Elitest and Bitter, the best way to combat this is just don't respond to them at all and stay on the topic.  When people get ignored completely they go away, its a very powerful tool when enough posters use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am going to open this again, I have wanted this thread to remain open.  So I will leave a note for the moderators. <br />
<br />
Do not close this thread.<br />
<br />
And a Note to people in this thread.  If you degenerate to insults (calling even a group of people Jerks is an insult, and will get your posted edited...) YOU WILL BE BANNED <br />
<br />
so a second note to moderators... If you see someone toss an insult in this thread, do not pass go, do not give them $200 monopoly dollars... instead click on the &quot;Moderation Pannel&quot; button that should be at the botom of the forums for you and BAN the user...<br />
<br />
I do not care what other people think a rant board should be.  OUR rant board is a place for people to vent frustration... but we expect people doing so to NOT insult, and to not CURSE, and to not attack a person, group or SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am really curious what is considered being elitist and discouraging.  Yes a bunch of us like to complain about things we think could be improved but there is a great spirit of collaboration and encouragement at the boards which I fully enjoy.<br />
<br />
The only thing I could possibly see someone getting distressed over is all of the posts that suggest that someone read the main board or stories of the same in EQ experiences.  Occasionally people come here and expect to be spoon fed details that are actually quite easy to find.  The nature of the folks who are regulars here is to try and find the info first, and possibly try it out before asking.  We get put off by those who are not willing to make a little effort to look first before asking.  If that is elitist, I guess anyone who makes an effort is elitist.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some of the things I see constantly that really do make this place feel... unfriendly:<br />
<br />
When I see someone come and ask for help and get a snotty &quot;Did you even LOOK for the information!&quot; or &quot;OMG try search&quot; responses. Just don't reply if it bothers you that much. Maybe someone else wants to answer because it makes them feel helpful? Maybe? Is that so horrible?<br />
<br />
Aid Grimel / uber guild people not worthy type of complaints.  Trade skills are for everyone and different people will do them for different reasons. Your reasons are no more &quot;worthy&quot; then anyone elses. So what if they went from 0 - 220 in everything just to get a quest earring. It's their time and their dime. They earned it just as much as the next person.<br />
<br />
If I love/hate the new UI ( or anything else for that matter ) I think I should be able to say that without being berated or called a whiner.<br />
<br />
I have been playing for 4 years. I have been doing trade skills ever since I can remember because I didn't know what else to do with all that stuff I kept foraging that the vendors wouldn't buy. The best thing that ever happened to me was finding EQ Traders a long time ago. The old boards used to be a lot more positive? towards new trade skillers. <br />
<br />
I rarely post and these are just a few of the reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Malathos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Perhaps, in the early days, when silks and pelts did not stack, and there was no good use for tradeskills, way after the original boards were formed (I think) - then EQtraders was a source of information for peope who delighted in the perverse occupation of tradeskills. For the best reason of all - because it was there.<br />
Nowadays, tradeskills seem to be overrun by people wanting to get to skill x in tradeskill y so they can continue with quest z so they can finally get item $ ( ran out of letters)... and in the process (I feel) something has been lost overall.<br />
I don't mean that everyone is tradeskilling for the wrong reasone - I mean that there are some people tradeskilling to get item $ as a result as opposed to tradeskilling &quot;because it is there&quot;.<br />
<br />
Overall - this will dilute the average tradeskilling attitude. Originally, it may have been - &quot;sure - to make sheet metal, you get ...&quot;; now it's more like &quot;go to www.eqtraders.com and look at the guide section for ...&quot;. A lot of this is because the number of people tradeskilling has increased hugely, but also because some people see it as a means to an end, as opposed to an end in itself.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry.  I'm as guilty as a lot of folk that frequent this site. If someone asks in OOC &quot;what is smithing - and what can I do with it ?&quot;, I'm a lot more likely to reply to them, than to people who shout &quot;what's the quickest way to skillup in x skill  so I can make soltice earrings&quot;<br />
<br />
And before I get accused of elitist attitudes, check my sig. The skill stats are accurate after over three years and  5 different servers - still not GM in anything, but a hardcore (if I can use the word) good  ol' fashioned tradeskiller - because it's there !<br />
<br />
... and special thanks to Ngreth for keeping this open - despite the obvious temptations.</div></div><hr />

YES!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But on the flip side, why should someone expect me to go do all of their research and work, when they have the exact same tools that I have, and give them all the answers.  This site is here to help everyone and many people come here asking how do you make ItemX without even looking.  This occurs frequently in the channel, and it amazes me how many people get downright angry when told to look it up themselves.  &quot;Quickly give me the steps to make cultural armor for *insert race*&quot;.  /boggle<br />
<br />
Many people don't bother looking before they post.  Many times you will see a post by a newcomer asking what to make in skill X after finishing Item Y.  If they had just looked 2 posts down they would have found the answer.  This happens a lot.  By directing people to the place they can find the answer, is encouraging them to do for themselves.  That whole &quot;teach a man to fish, eat for a lifetime&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is nothing rude about posting a link to the information or ignoring their post / question. Someone already stated earlier about the power of ignore and they were correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i have been visiting here for 4 years or so, have probably close to 100 pages scattered through my house of various recipes (one should be organized, one is not!!).  <br />
<br />
the amount of information here is beyond HUGE.  i am strictly speaking for myself now, but if i was a first time visitor here, i would be overwhelmed and just ask someone to point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
yes it means there are weekly, how do i raise tailoring with only 10k and in a week?  (i wish, am sick of otters atm lol)<br />
<br />
but i would rather point them to the sort by trivial recipes and suggest they look (insert link or thread), than shout at them that they are stupid for not using search.  sometimes is hard to search for a topic when you may not even know the correct name.<br />
<br />
there are elitests out there.  are a lot of times i am turned off by some of the community (hope this isnt a flame to get me banned, not my intent!!).  am relatively certain are times i have irritated folks myself :shocked: <br />
<br />
but in the end, it comes down to the fact that we all like/hate tradeskills in our own unique way.  some for the love of making things (still remember my first fishroll and skill up to 1!!!), some to get an earring.  both are valid.<br />

<br />
I believe this has more to do with the fact that you can now legitimately task out of EverQuest than people's changing attitudes.  Before SOE allowed this, many of us had many print outs to which we referred.  I have a huge, black binder filled with maps, tradeskill recipes, vender locations, etc. and I frequently used it to look up information for friends, guildmates and just random people who didn't have the information handy and couldn't come to this site without logging all the way out.  <br />
<br />
Nowadays, that black binder is sitting under my bed.  Whenever I need to look up something, I hit alt-tab and do a search.  If it's that easy, why not give people the information necessary for them to do it themselves?  And yes, even after that time I continued to give advice and answer questions for people, but I no longer dug out my black binder to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">have a drawer in a file cabinet in the computer room with stuff organized and labeled.  much easier than alt tabbing but i do the same thing.  <br />
<br />
i get anoyyed at the second or third identical post of the day.  anyone should at least scan the thread titles before posting.  i also get anoyyed when people don't read the faqs and ask that question repeatedly.  their is lots of good information in the faqs and they should read them anywyay.  i get anoyyed at people violating (seriously violating i give larger grey areas than the mods from what i've seen.) the rules in the visitors corner.  i was a lurker for quite a while before signing up and i read them.  i expect people to read stickies at the top of the page.  questions that have been answered in the sticky annoy me.  if it is in a guide and you are really interested in that area i think you should read the guides before asking questions.  many are already answered.<br />
<br />
i don't expect people to come here and instanly know all about the search engine.  if you are asking for solstice earring recipe (or similar) i exspect you to have looked on the main site and tried at least 3 times to discover it on your own.  your information or lack of can determine how successful you will be and then you can post if that didn't work.  its much simpler to search for yourself than to post and then wait for replys.  <br />
<br />
for the most part anyone new (bright eyed and bushy tailed and overwhelmed here) i cut a lot of slack.  it gets tiring after so many though.  in game i am much better.  here the information is normally easily available.  sometimes the replies will be about how to use a feature so that next time they can find the anser themselves instead of having to keep waiting on info handouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Utope Eljugador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Who remembers when they made it possible to pick up a single item from a stack with ctrl ? I do. Fletchers in particular were overjoyed.I did fletching to maybe 100ish before that change. Where's my fruit cake and cheesy gold watch? Before that wasnt it something like the arrow combines only gave 1 arrow? Then they changed it to increased cost but increased yeild? I wasnt even around for that but I remember talk of it.<br />
<br />
There's quite a bit of &quot;I did it the hard way&quot; sentiment, but mostly its misdirected frustration and anger. Unfortunate yes but understandable. I simply ignore it.<br />
<br />
Complaining about it doesnt change the situation nor change the facts. And calling everyone &quot;a bunch of jerks&quot; not only is ridiculous and whiney but you've now become what you're complaining about. <br />
<br />
I happen to enjoy EQtraders. I think its the best eq site available, has the most accurate and available information. Due in part to both the contributing members and the hard working operators of the board. <br />
<br />
PS, eqtraders &gt; teh S4feh0us3 (i remember when it was a useful site.. /sigh), alla's, or eqmaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Koru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Some of it for me is also being tired. I mean you give someone info once and all too often it's all &quot;how many to make that?&quot; &quot;where's that drop?&quot; &quot;where's that merchant?&quot; from there on. Look, I enjoy the game, I like knowing things, but I'm not in this just to be a walking knowledge base. If I were I'd apply to be a guide (and probably do poorly on account of both knowing the stuff and being mostly willing to share that knowledge). :p<br />
<br />
Sometimes it just gets a little overwhelming when yet another person wants to know the names, places to buy, how to make and what to make from skill point A to skill point B where gap between those skill points is 100+. A part of it is that the skill guides up are old and out of date I would say. Maybe if they had better From 0 to 250 Skill Guide there would be less questions that are easily found or get asked over and over again until everyone hates them.<br />
<br />
I know in game I expect the people around me to show a certain level of respect for my time and I in turn will do the same for them. Things like 'do not expect me to gate out of the dungeon to port your latest twink from BB to EC - use the frigging book!' yes this has happened to me and to some extent I apply this to boards I frequent. Now my response is to just not reply to questions that I consider too easily answered to take up my time. But then I've always been the lurking kind and generally don't open up posts that sound like they're gonna be big on easy questions if I'm not in the mood. Ignorance is bliss that way.<br />
<br />
Oh and the big black binder is what I call the BoEK. Binder of Essential Knowledge. I still have mine, it saves time. More useful than any in game item I have. As nice as it is to be able to tab out there are still times when I can't, or it's complicated enough that I need both my screen in EQ and the info on hand - the BoEK is the best for those times. If I could give every single person I know one who doesn't have one I would. Those things seem to be +50 int/wis with focus effect Self Sufficience IV. ;)</div></div><hr />

Those who been around for over 2 years might still remember my 'search' sig and zealous moderation of the smithing forum.<br />
<br />
I have learned one very important thing from my time as moderator here, not responding to a post is sometimes much better course of action than doing so.<br />
<br />
So I can only suggest one thing to the board residents, do demonstrate as much self control and courtesy as what you are expecting from the visitors. Also, by all means, please learn how to ignore stuff that irritates you.</div></div><hr />

This pretty much hit it on the head for me,  even before AG there was always resentment (At least I felt it) to anyone that was 60 (now 65) in a high level guild, that if you were not 56 or less, guildless your interest in trades was unclean and dirty and we all  got paid to got skill up by our guilds.<br />

I had fun in the days of Angelsyn and I debating economics, but under that, not from Angel, there was a real sence of growing hostility, I was far more then a contributor on the old board, I am just starting to really post here now,   really brought back in to things because the uber guilds call for the nerfing of ele bows,  as I am one of them, an ele/time flagged person, I felt I could call them on their own  elitism  without the taint of self interest.<br />

What Drives Me Nuts ....<br />
are the LAZY people who think THEIR time is too important to look at the wealth of information provided at the website.  Hundreds of people (both 'staff' and just ole tradeskill junkies) have already put in thousands upon thousands of collective hours to compile just about EVERYTHING you could ever want to know about EQ tradeskills.    <br />
<br />
Yet you can't take the time to research what to make after level 46 in pottery, and even when told that Item A might make be a good next choice you then want to be spoon-fed the recipe.<br />
<br />
I do find the searches on the message board difficult to narrow down to a manageable number of results for most questions.  But for goodness sake, there is an amazing database of information at your fingertips.  Instead of expecting others to spend THEIR time wiping your nose, take YOUR time and do some homework.  <br />
<br />
Having vented that (smile) .. I do try to take the approach of just not responding to messages that make me just sit here and shake my head :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lilosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It all boils down to laziness for me.<br />
<br />
99.999999% of all questions can be answered by searching the new DB that the Admin Staff and Volunteers spent HUNDREDS or THOUSANDS of man hours putting together.    Or by scanning the first two-three pages of thread titles in the appropriate forum.  Or, as Suma used to have in their BEAUTIFUL sig,  Using the search function.  In about 1-2 minutes of searching, I have the answers to 99.999999% of my questions.<br />

<br />
I refuse to encourage laziness.<br />
<br />
When I point out to people, normally in a not-rude but semi-direct manner that they'd be better off getting the information themselves, they always seem to call me a ****, and suggest that I should shut up and let other people feed them the answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is why I sometimes slip and get a little snippy with people.   After the fourth &quot;How do I make XXXX armor?&quot;  &quot;Ok, where do I buy the ore&quot;  &quot;Ok what zone is that it&quot;  &quot;Ok, who's the merchant&quot;  &quot;Ok, how do I do subcombine YYY&quot;  , we (the regulars, as it were) tend to get tired and cranky.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aethia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm reading posts while the servers are being patched.<br />
<br />
And while I haven't been playing since beta, I do remember the days of sitting and medding with your book.  I do remember having 5 food and water thinking I was going to die if I ran out.  As for tradeskills, all I remember is casks not stacking.<br />
<br />
But things change.  And I have to ask a strange question and the analogy may not be perfect, but for me it strikes a cord.<br />
<br />
100 years ago, our ancestors had no microwaves.  Does that mean their cooking was better then ours?  <br />
<br />
TV dinners came out in the 1950s as a way for the family to enjoy dinner while watching television.  Was this good or bad?<br />
<br />
I am a US citizen living in Germany.  I watch my bf's grandmother cook a huge meal for 8 in a tiny little kitchen, the size of most closets in America.  I need 4x that space to do the same thing and my food doesn't taste anywhere as good as hers.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't want to go back to the RL days of cooking over campfires.  And in EQ, I don't want to sit and look at a book and med.  I don't want to take boats (given that PoP introduced books as quick travel).  I don't want to go back to the days that people describe of clicking a stack, have having to type in 1 to get one item.  Or having one container open.<br />
<br />
I have GM'd 5 trades across various toons the 'old fashioned way'.  I'm looking forward to having more skills higher.  I'm looking forward to having more of my friend become addicted to tradeskilling. <br />
<br />
Does the new UI diminish your efforts? only if you allow it to.  And that is an individual choice.  I still believe the 'old fashioned way' should be used for cultural and similar niche trades.  That's just me, and I have yet to work on my cultural smithing, but close.  I think it is a balance between spoon feeding and getting carpal tunnel.<br />
<br />
Change is growth - not always positive, but if we didn't change we'd all be waiting for the boat, while looking at our spell books.<br />
<br />
Now... if we could just do something about the people I encounter in game, that expect me to know every single item tradeskilled made, the stats, the full name, the trivial.... then I'd say that change would be good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>dahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Although most of eq server are PvE and favor grouping and helping each others in order to achieve the same goal, competitions cannot be avoided : competitions between group or guild or just some players who need the same objective at the same time (camping a mob).<br />
<br />
Sometimes you can discover a feature or a trick that would make goal achievement more easy before everybody. Most people who discover them tend to keep for themself first, then talk about that to their friends, their guildmate, then perhaps in popular forum. Telling the method in open forum make you sure people will try it, and &quot;competition&quot; will increase. Also some will try to monopolise the feature, to &quot;sploit&quot;.<br />

I think this situation can be applied too in tradeskill. That is also why most &quot;old school&quot; people, who were enthousiast at the first time, became bitter in delivering &quot;free info&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Phabos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've been around the boards for a year. Not a long time, but enough to read and think and see trends and patterns. <br />
<br />
When I first read this post, it didn't mean much to me. Yes, I've seen the examples from time to time, but they were usually few and far between. After the past couple of days, however, especially in reading the posts since GoD and the UI were announced up through today (2/13/04), I'm beginning to notice something. <br />
<br />
I don't know if this has just affected tradeskillers, or if this is a trend among the general EQ populace, but it seems like a lot of people have developed a decided lack of common courtesy and respect. <br />
<br />
I've seen it here, I've seen it in channel. &quot;SOE screwed us again,&quot; &quot;SOE is (insert favorite insult, usually modified with profanity here),&quot; and my favorite, &quot;SOE doesn't care.&quot; Sony Online Entertainment, Inc. is a  company with customers. Nope, you're not the only one that matters in the whole scheme of things, no matter what you like to think. If you accept to be a customer by paying your money, then you accept what the game has to offer. <br />
<br />
If you don't want to play the game, if the game frustrates you that much, if you hate what the developers have done to &quot;your&quot; game, leave. Go. The rest of us really don't want to listen to you. EQ is a game, not a way of life. Too many people treat it as life or death. Get a grip on reality. You don't like what happens in &quot;your&quot; virtual world? Go outside. Read a book. Participate in the real world. Oh, and if someone changes something there that you don't like, guess what? Life ain't fair. Life has its authority figures, and you are just small interest to be considered. You won't always get your way.<br />
<br />
So SOE put in something you didn't like? What would honestly happen if you publicly criticized your boss for making changes where you work? You'd be gone eventually. <br />
<br />
Oh, but you're a customer and you're too important to be ignored? You are one of thousands. You choose to pay your fees. Accept that the interests of the many, or, more importantly, the interests that SOE sees most vital to its corporate well being, are probably more important than you are. Don't like it? Play another game.<br />
<br />
Just please stop subjecting those of us who actually enjoy EQ as a means of relaxation from your mindless &quot;me-first&quot; or &quot;I'm better than you&quot; attitude. Some call those elitist. I call it childish and selfish. <br />

<br />
It got really bad here about 6 to 8 months ago, alot of threads were just full of &quot;beats the dead horse&quot; posts etc.  I just stopped visiting the messageboards for a while heh.  Now I just ignore them.<br />

This board has too many good informative posters to keep me away for too long anyways.</div></div><hr />

At first it is a lot to sort through, so you will get FAQ's.  Heck, that's how the moderated get their FAQ's in the first place, so it's not a bad thing I think.<br />
<br />
I get a little more frightened to ask for help each time, but I do it anyway.  I feel that yes, we are to work and find as much as we can.  I do hate it when people ask me to mostly just do the quests for them, but this board and site is here to help us find stuff.  It is here to make it easier for all of us.  That is the point!  I say ask away, and dont worry about the people who jerk you around.  They probably had a bad day or are a just a little competative maybe.</div></div><hr />

Interestingly enough I had the same thought with a different focus about certain events of late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Well, if you think things are bad here, try Serverwide.eqtraders<br />

I made the mistake of asking a question there ONCE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Quinner Sparrowhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I sense a disturbance in the force as if a million tradeskillers (ok maybe a thousand) released primal screams of angst.......<br />
<br />
There is a dark undercurrent in America right now and the EQ Universe is not immune to its influence. We have been on a crash course of negativity brought on by a culture built on egocenticism. In everything there seems to be this mentality of us against them.<br />
<br />
As for requests for information, a great deal of anger can be avoided by how the question is phrased. When someone posts for the very first time in the Tailoring section and asks &quot;How can I use &lt;insert illegal program here&gt; to get my tailoring to 250&quot; or &quot;what items will make me the most money&quot; there are bound to be old time craftsmen who are annoyed and feel they must correct the errant individual. And when someone drops in the channel for the very first time with a question like &quot;How much will you suckers I mean tradeskillers pay for x and where can my bot farm tons of it&quot; or &quot;What's the recipe for misty thicket picnics&quot; they are bound to get the same response.<br />
<br />
One should post comments first before asking for help or chat in the channel before asking for a recipe. Why? Because it establishes a relationship. Anyone in sales or management could explain it to you (Yes, I have read Carnagie&lt;sp&gt;). Just blurting out questions makes the other posters or chatters feel demeaned, as if they only exist to provide answers.<br />
<br />
I hope this all is considered constructive. My biggest barrier to posting more often is the fact that my school system has firewalled anything with EQ in it :steamed: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>TheGiantOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hehe...<br />
<br />
Okay I gonna try and be nice about this or some big ogre :::looks over my shoulder::<br />
is gonna eat me alive.<br />
<br />
My view is the following.   Did I ask for any help IN GAME for advice on any of the 7 tradeskills I completed.  Hmm..nope I got my information by going to eqtraders.com and using that &quot;search&quot; button.<br />
<br />
Now I have no problem helping others reach my plateau in any tradeskill as I don't consider them as a threat or competition to me in any way, shape or form.<br />
<br />
I do have a line of patience however when the following happens in-game.<br />
<br />
Player A:  Oh yes I heard you are a Grandmaster of all Tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Me:  Yes I am..how can I help you?<br />
<br />
Player A:  Can you tell me what the easiest way to get up to 250 in fletching is?<br />
<br />
Me:  Sure no problem.  The fastest way if you don't have a problem with spending plat on the skill is making bows right in front of the Fletcher NPC in Shadowhaven.<br />
<br />
Okay so no problems up to this point so all is good.  This is what transpired over the next freaking 3 hours btw hehe after the first conversation I had.<br />
<br />
I got at least 1 tell every 10 min from same person regarding how he was having problems from finding the NPC merchant in SH to how much he should invest in making bows to how he was having problems making skillup points to what material should he use for each type of bow to where was the best place he should sell the bow to he wanted to know how much he could make once he reached 250 in the skill in Fletching to weight allowance.  You name it I answered his questions over a 3 hour period.<br />
<br />
Okay in the meantime I have 20+ tell windows open helping others out also.<br />
<br />
I held my tongue with the above person and helped him but this is what broke the straw on the camels back.  This same person after all of that needs help in 2 other skills they are working on.  I tried to be patient with him but I also started pointing him toward eqtraders.com of which I informed him WAS the best site for any info on tradeskilling out there.  LOL...okay thought I was going to have a moment of rest when &quot;presto&quot; guess who is back?  I spent the next 30 min explaining to him how to alt tab out of game to visit the website.<br />
<br />
I don't mind helping people out in tradeskills as I have a huge vat of knowledge built up in my lil barbarian brain.  But all of us GM Tradeskillers do have a breaking point after a while.<br />
<br />
For instance put yourself in our place for a sec.  You as the tradeskiller are hunting in an LDoN group which as you know is non-stop.  Every 5 min you get to either see a tell screen pop up in front of you asking for help in tradeskilling or right in front of you in chat box.  Now I know what some of you are thinking right now.  Why don't I just stick my tells in another chat box all together and just minimize it.  Thats great except then people who are asking for help think you are ignoring them.<br />
<br />
So I have come up with a simple solution now.  When I am tradeskilling I keep my tell windows open.  When I am not I have an afk message stating that I am away hunting and can help out with tradeskilling later and to leave a message.<br />
<br />
So before any one person uses the term &quot;elitest&quot; please put yourself in our place first.  As a Grandmaster in any tradeskill also comes a responsibility and we know this.  We do strive and help you out whenever we can.  But you have to admit after seeing the same question asked over and over again on same boards it does get tedious and yes some people will get straight to the point and suggest &quot;why don't you use search&quot;.  What will it hurt if you spend just 15 more seconds using the search function and find out your answer.  Or maybe you won't.  If you don't then by all means post your question but at same time also post you couldn't find the answer anywhere on boards.<br />
<br />
Please also remember we went through all the aggravation and frustration you are going through when we were working toward being a GM tradeskiller.<br />
<br />
It all boils down to what I have read and yes god help me I have read these boards and threads everyday.  The compilation done by the moderators of the boards, by the GM tradeskillers and anyone contributing information to these boards is a tremendous boon not only to the Tradeskill community but also to the average player out there who wants an item made.  And the MOST BEAUTIFUL part is:  Its available to everyone and not just tradeskillers by using &quot;SEARCH&quot; function.<br />
<br />
Use search then post like this.<br />
<br />
I have searched these boards and can't find an answer to my problem so would appreciate any help you can give me concerning :::whatever subject::.<br />
<br />
But we all have to remember that on both sides of the equation there is a &quot;REAL LIVE HUMAN BEING WITH FEELINGS&quot; using that keyboard.<br />
<br />
LOL..okay this elitest (woops never been called that) needs some sleep now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Rhyianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Nicely put Giant.<br />
<br />
there are 2 sides to this (or possibly many sides?).  i had been active on the local eq forum for a while.  this was prior to my upgrading my machine btw...  asked in the channel (politely i thought) that i couldnt find my notes on xyz simple recipe, was brain damaged and my equipment does not allow me to window out (really it would lock everyting up..)  i was read the riot act on how no one is there to spoon feed anyone else.... really realy left a bad taste in my mouth for every asking a question again.  i knew at least 60% of the folks in the channel too :(.  /remove channel from autojoin.<br />
<br />
i also have been asked questions on how to make things.  i myself do not have the patience of Giant, wow, i applaud you.  but how long can it take to direct someone here, give them a few pointers (read the faq, search the recipes, they sort by trivial too).  also been asked to smith stuff.  *i have all the components, can you come do this?*  ummm, i am arse-deep in the deep atm, took me hours to get here, and i dont see a handy forge.  feel free to ask me tho when i am not in the deep lol.<br />
<br />
hrm, in a mood to blather today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I no longer go to &quot;our&quot; channel.<br />
<br />
I wish it was not named after our Site, because frankly people ARE rude on that channel.  Yes some people DO deserve the rudeness... but I do find that many people do not even read the whole question... they just imidiately attack as soon as someone asks a question...  This is one of the reasons we do the &quot;We are not affiliated wiht the chat channel&quot;<br />
<br />
But such is life, we don't controll all things. and we try to keep it better here :)  We are not perfect on it, but it is better than the chat channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">In a sense, it hurts to hear that said, Ngreth Sir. There are still a relatively large handful of us who consider ourselves to honestly care about what goes on in channel. Oddly enough, a portion of those regulars are the people who most often get used and abused for their knowledge, then get fed up with the abuse, then answer a question with 'go to eqtraders.com and use the search function', and then get called rude, elitist, or worse. <br />
<br />
<br />
To sum up the general point of the post: We can't win. We either go out of our way to spoon-feed, or get walked over and hated. <br />
<br />
<br />
There is always, of course, Lilosh's amusing story about the druid who was /convinced/ that the clay she needed for her epic could be bought, and angered the entire channel because she could not understand that she was being given clear, explicit, and correct directions on what to do. <br />
<br />
There are so many people like that, 'noobs' if I may bend a term, that enter channel and want copious amounts of information spoonfed to them, and possibly complain about BSoDs if they try to window. BSoDs are not our problem; self-research in the long run is the best option. But there &lt;i&gt;simply is no way to say this without running a high risk of being called elitist&lt;/i&gt; by people who don't deserve to be slinging that adjective around. <br />
<br />
<br />
server.name01: How do I skill up fletching from 21-250?<br />
channel.regular25: Go to eqtraders.com, look around, you'll find all the information there. <br />
server.name01: I can't shrink the screen, my laptop will crash. <br />
&lt;i&gt;(Sanna's note: My roommate plays on a laptop that barely meets game reqs and she can alt-enter juuust fine, thanks. Sure, it takes 3 minutes to load a page, but she doesn't BSoD.) &lt;/i&gt;<br />
server.name01: you guys won't tell me anything, what a bunch of lame-os. <br />
marr.Tinkbang: /sigh....<br />
<br />
<br />
Give a man a 1 lb saltwater tuna and he will eat for 30 minutes. Tell the man where to go to learn how to bake that tuna, and he will throw a hissy fit. We can't win. <br />
<br />
We can help. We can teach. But 'you' have to be willing to learn. Otherwise 'you' WILL call us names, names we don't deserve, mind you, and if we ever try to defend ourselves, 'you' will merely repeat your barrage as though it answers everything. Too often I have seen the people slinging that E-word around because they're not getting tradeskills handed to them. I did my research. Do yours, please. <br />
<br />
<br />
That's why it pains me, though I understand why, that the site has pulled away from the channel. I, for one, have only ever seen the channel defend the site.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">One of the semi frequent questions in the channel (used to be more frequent) is:<br />
<br />
newbie: What are the potc gifts?<br />
oldie: stein, idol, sickle, pie, mtp, cabbage, robe, rod, champagne<br />
newbie: in a forge?<br />
oldie: yes<br />
newbie: what skill do i need to have?<br />
oldie: none, it's no fail.  many have gotten smithing 1 on their combine.<br />
newbie:  cool, thanks<br />
oldie: sure np<br />
<br />
few minutes pass<br />
<br />
newbie: how do you make potc robe?<br />
oldie: go look it up at www.eqtraders.com<br />
newbie: wth just tell me<br />
oldie: uh no, it's quite an involved recipe and you should go look it up<br />
newbie: complains a few times more about elitist tradeskill snobs<br />
newbie: fine, how do you make the sickle?<br />
oldie: /camp<br />
<br />
This is not made up.  This is not an exaggeration.  In fact, this is a mild representation.  It happens *all* the time, and usually a lot worse.  People refuse to help themselves, and honestly, that is rather sad and one of the huge problems with society today.  If it makes me a bad person to say &quot;look it up on eqtraders.com&quot; then fine, I'm a bad person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ngreth Thergn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yup.  But I do see people ask for something simple, and just becasue *YOUR* old laptop can task switch... doesn't mean someone else doesn't have a problem.  (not that I think some people also don't lie about it... but...)<br />
<br />
When it is a complex mess I see refering people to the site.<br />
<br />
It jsut gets me when people instantly jump on the &quot;don't be lazy&quot; bandwagon (which I saw happen) before they have read the whole question.  They don't bother to say &quot;That is too complex to go over in chat... you really need to go hit the site&quot;  They don't bother to look and see that that particular question DOES have a simple one line answer... They imidiately jump on the &quot;don't be lazy&quot; bandwagon.<br />
<br />
I am not saying people don't abuse the channel.  But the Channel abuses people too :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">i have told people the entire potc recipe as well as the recipe for mtps.  when they wanted sub combines it was time to look t the sight though.  <br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>TheGiantOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well...<br />
<br />
Lets put it this way.  I very rarely come onto the serverwide channel.  I am kept busy enough just with my reputation as a Tradeskiller without the channel on.<br />
<br />
Again all I can suggest is the following:<br />
<br />
If you are really busy in game and cannot help someone don't just ignore the person or be rude to them.  Say very nicely can we chat instead in about an hour when I am not so busy so I can really concentrate on helping you.<br />
<br />
I have noticed a huge dropoff on questions being asked about recipies now since the new UI came out.<br />
<br />
Also another suggestion I use all the time is the following:  Player A comes to me working on say tailoring or smithing but doesn't have the plat to buy this and that or the patience to farm (yes we all hate that word) the items for the combines for the skillups so I hire them to go out and get stuff like I would need for leather padding or velium bricks etc.  They get paid what the going rate is for buying in bulk for those materials.  They save me time and they have the plat to go up the ladder in their skillups.<br />
<br />
But I can understand how irritatting it could get if you get what we call a &quot;leach&quot;  hehe who latches onto you and follows you all around asking you a ? every 10 min.  But after a while very politely let them know that they could find the answers a lot quicker by going to eqtraders.com.  Why?   LOL...Because all of us tradeskillers don't have everything memorized in our brains to give an answer to every answer in tradeskills.  Yes I even have to alt tab at times to refresh my memory on something.  So I let the person asking a lot of questions this so one they don't feel slighted and in a way in the end they feel more confident in themselves when they find out the info they were looking for.<br />
<br />
Now in answer also the the &quot;hungry ogre&quot;.  You are absolutely correct on some rudeness happening and yes it does reflect on the rest of the tradeskill community.  But lets reflect on this for one minute.  Just like the community in general in game has problems with economy because of duped plat, buying and selling of items for US dollars, etc this does fall over into the tradeskill community unfortunately for when someone buys a EQ account they are buying ALL the skills that come with that person's account including tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
There is really no way to differ between a real tradeskiller who is not a GM in that skill and one that is a bought character.  Therein lies a huge problem as what do you do in that case.  Some of this resentment as we call it is caused from a overflow of questions brought forth by bought characters which is a shame indeed.  How do you combat that?  You really can't.  You have to treat everyone the same and develop a reputation for yourself as a fair but hard working GM tradeskiller.<br />
<br />
People think that GM Tradeskillers go for tradeskilling for either the titles or the plat they can make.  Not so for the proud amongst us GM Tradeskillers who make many many many friends along the way to that title.<br />
<br />
Another false truth is that GM Tradeskillers compete with each other.  LOL..if anything we help each other out with controlling costs on items we make, on helping each other out with supplies we need at the lowest cost etc.  Oh sure you get the occassional we are going to cutthroat your prices to try and put you out of business GM Tradeskiller and what do we do with them?  We let them sell their items first and they go home happy and we are rid of them.<br />
<br />
So the next time someone is is coming up the ladder asked you what to charge give him that advice as he/she will tell two friends and so on and so on and so on.  You get the picture.<br />
<br />
Hehe I am on a roll so another false truth is  WE ONLY do TRADEskilling IN THE GAME period.  Hmm..not so my tradeskilling character is also my main and only character in EQ and has been since April 1999.<br />
<br />
Now I do have a confession though to make.  One I have been doing tradeskilling way before I came to these boards posting.  Two I very rarely post for a few reasons.  I am too long drawn out in my explanantions and a few times I have seen people who have gotten answers from people turn around and flame the same people who are helping them and 3 I spend time in the game itself on my server helping out people who btw I have never been called an elitest or a pompous butt-head or said I ignored them or that I was greedy well ok except for the one time uhh..hmm..umm stole that large muffin from that ogre next door ::ducks::<br />
<br />
With that in I go into the game again and leave you all with a message.  &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot;<br />
<br />
And also remember that &quot;TWO WRONGS DO NOT MAKE A RIGHT&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Hibashira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">My 2 cents.<br />
<br />
To claim there exist an elitist attitude is to admit<br />
<br />
1) that the claimant him/herself is lacking in some way, and <br />
2) that it is ok to continue to exist ... lacking, and<br />
3) that it is the said elitists responsiblity to accomodate those that are lacking.<br />
<br />
To me, there are only two types of people, the knows and the don't-knows.  If you are a don't-know, you should strive to become a know.  How, you ask?  By learning from trying, from reading, and from researching; not from asking for the answer and certain not from begging.  The answer to almost every questions that you have had already been answered, posted, re-answered, re-posted multiple times.  Before you ask a question, consider finding the answer yourself.<br />
<br />
i.e. Strive to become one of the knows and not be content as a don't-know, and THEN whine about elitist attitude.<br />
<br />
There is no elitist in tradeskills, only the knows who are tired of hand-holding the don't-knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I was gonna say something, but Lilosh and Sanna said it best. We play this game for fun too, and we should not have to drop everything every few minutes to handhold someone through the entire process of tradeskilling when there are so many great resources on the web that are INCREDIBLY easy to find. If I can't find what I need on eqtraders, I can usually find it on Allakhazams or even Google. It's not that hard, and expecting someone else to use up thier leisure time to handhold you through the exact method of, say, getting to 250 tailoring complete with Item names, Item recipes, NPC Locations, spawn times, and expected returns in spreadsheet forms is bullheaded and arrogant.<br />
<br />
And I personally don't see very many people being rude in the eqtraders channel to start with. Even the most vehement of the &quot;Use search&quot; crew is usually polite and respectful at first. We don't start fights. However, we are more than happy to finish em.</div></div><hr />

Unlike, say, shadowknight.org/serverwide.sk (picking a random example out of thin air). :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Qutie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Above all, if you genuinely feel like the boards here are filled with &quot;Elitest {folks}&quot; who are selfish, and ruin the fun for you, Then I think utilizing the door would be more productive then insulting all of us. <br />

Or, they could just ignore that kind of attitudinal response as well.  I can understand the frustration of having people send tells asking questions, I can see how finding 10 &quot;how do I .... &quot; entries on the board makes some people's blood boil.  I would &quot;guess&quot; it would be easier to ignore/pass over that post and as someone earlier stated let a person that actually Likes responding do so.  I imagine the time it takes someone to post &quot; OMG'z did you even LOOK at the FAQ, list, search feature&quot; could be better utilized elsewhere. Why would anyone Choose to frustrate Themselves endlessly?<br />

I've been tradeskilling (on several characters) since I began playing EQ back in 1999. First as a druid using the stuff I would forage, and when I found EQTraders it was a thrill. I have binders printed out for everything I might Ever do... and still I have questions at times... I just rarely bother to ask them here nowdays.  I am not an Ardent Tradeskiller, I just like to make things.  My personal favorite was and is still baking, the One I GM'd. <br />
<br />
Rudeness or elitist behavior is wrong, and it's Wrong on both sides of the post or question. Having someone deeply affiliated with this site essentially saying &quot;don't like it, there's the door... &quot; smacks of the very elitist attitude people Do complain about these days.  <br />
<br />
I'd much prefer folks to ignore the questions that seem to bug them to no end than to hand out a unilateral slap in the face. <br />
<br />
I visited eqtraders for years before actually joining because I Did like to look for what I needed and I was lucky enough to have people on my server that I could ask questions if I couldn't find an answer here.  Now days, it's much more complex, we have a Lot of new to the game people and visiting here to find info is a bit more involved.  Cutting them some slack, or really... just ignoring their post (because Someone Will ALWAYS answer them) would be preferable than seeing some of the responses I've seen. <br />
<br />
I don't mean this as a flame and I hope it is not taken as one, it's just... seeing people state that they are almost AFRAID to post a question kind of hurts, when I think of all the good that has come and continue's to do so from Niami's (and the others) efforts.</div></div><hr />

Don't say that! February isn't over yet, it will go to my head! <br />

... I had posted something else in here, after my one shown post... not sure what happened, guess the browser ate it. ^_^<br />

It's not like channel is a constant barrage of yelling screaming angry people. It's really just a small amount of the time that incidents occur. We do our best, and I don't think it's unfair to expect anyone else to do their fair share of out-of-game research either. And... that's about the sum of the opinion. <br />
