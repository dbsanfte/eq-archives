<br />
If I cant find some one then I will just finish lvling my chanter and make them my self.<br />
<br />
I dont have that much money due to buying all the supplies for all the vials but would greatly appriciate any help that anyone is able to offer here. I will donate what I can to help you with your time and will get you KEI to help you out and or mod rods BST Crack and what not to help it go faster. Though as of last night I was at about 200pp in the bank and on me.<br />
<br />
My name is Soriab Whitebeast on the Povar server. PST in game. Normally on after 6:00PM CST</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm able to make vials of viscous, cloudy, clear, or distilled mana.  Please respond here or I'll look for you online.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

-Liloshviscous for Wu's<br />
<br />
Then Enchanter that makes them will only be required to cast. I have all the regents for the spell. 42 Poision Vials and 42 Perls</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Smalltim, my enchanter, is level 24, and has 163 INT.   So KEI will be a mighty nice thing, as will patience.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if you can throw a bit of plat for a KEI , and whatever else you think appropriate, then I dont mind sitting with you for a bit making the vials.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look for Smalltim or Noishpa  online.<br />

If you still need the vials just send me a tell ingame. Best shot is to one of my sellers, either Wegotit or Salesmeister. only charge would be a KIE or whatever with stick on a level 16 and that just to make it go a bit faster. I can do 8 vials at with a full mana bar.<br />
<br />
EDIT: LOL I just looked at the date on this and its only about 3 months old. Well if anyone needs the Viscous vials chanted just let me know.</div></div><hr />
