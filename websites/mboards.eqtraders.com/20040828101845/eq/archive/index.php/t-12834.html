I know that when you go to your guild trainer there are some skills that when trained while you are level 2+, you get your current level as your skill in whatever you just trained.  For example, if you are level 30 and train one of these skills, your first point of training grants you a skill of 30.  I thought this applied, at least for shamans, to anything other than tradeskills, but at least one person on the shaman boards is disputing that.  Anyone here know exactly how that works?<br />
<br />
I know that it does *not* apply to the general tradeskills or to alchemy, which is all I need for my purposes as far as tradeskills go.  But I'm wondering about the other shaman skills that won't automatically go up without deliberately using them or training them, like weapon skills, dodge, alcohol tolerance, bind wound, swimming, the five casting skills, channeling, meditate, and languages.<br />
<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />
