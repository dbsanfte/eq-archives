<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draconovae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I leveled my shammy to 29, and started making blood of the wolf potions for skill ups and potential profit. I raised skill to 25, and then went out to get some more exp and loot and pp, since the ingredients can be expensive. Anyway, i was killed and lost level 29, and then got some exp and re-dinged 29, but now it seems that I am getting no skill ups, no matter how many potions i make. Is there some kind of bug that is causing this? Does the EQ bot think i'm under 29 because i lost level, even though i regained it? wisdom is a respectable 157, but i have been making dozens of blood of wolf potion with no skill ups, any help would be appreciated (p.s. whats the secret to making these affordable? I have calculated that i woulld have to sell them at 105pp just to break even, and yes, i have charisma buff when i buy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verdandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are already at the cap for level 29.  The formula for the cap on alchemy skill is:<br />
<br />
(Your character level minus 24) times 5<br />
<br />
In your case that's 25.  You need more levels before you can get more skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As to your second question on making the potions affordable, you need to get your skill level higher so that your success rate is higher.  At a 95% success rate it costs something like 55pp to make a 10 dose blood of wolf.</div></div><hr />
