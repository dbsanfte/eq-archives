<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laurelai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I had a bunch of ice lichen lying around taking up bank space, so I decided to brew it up and get it out of my bank.  I made quite a few bottles of Ice Brewed Ale and noted that A) the @!@#$@! things don't stack, and B) they have an effect listed.  Nifty!<br />
<br />
Being a conniseur of the ferment, I decided that I would be my own best guinea pig and drank it down to see what this &quot;Intoxication II&quot; effect was.<br />
<br />
I got an icon on my buff area that resembled a SoW icon, but other than that, I saw no effects.  Well... being a connisuer of the ferment, I have an alcohol tolerance of 200.  I thought that maybe that was the reason I was seeing no effects.<br />
<br />
So I /ooc'd for a volunteer to try out my brew.  His AT was less than 100, and he saw no difference besides the icon either.<br />
<br />
So.... what is this effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">makes you run faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have no AT and tried one with Intoxication I.  It makes you run faster, but with no AT it lowered my INT.  I don't know about my WIS because I have way more then the 255 cap for my level.</div></div><hr />
