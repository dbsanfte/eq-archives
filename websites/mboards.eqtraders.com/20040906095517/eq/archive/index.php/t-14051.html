<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jpathomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to take a moment to thank all the posters here, along with the people who  keep EQTrader's Corner up and running, for all their hard work and helpfull information.<br />
<br />
I've been playing EQ for a little over 4 years, and frankly, I hated trade skills. Too time consuming, to complacated, to expensive. Still, lots of my friends were trade skillers, and they kept telling me about this or that cool thing they were makeing. My standard response was &quot;Exactly how can you fail to make a rat sandwitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, I finially decided about a month ago that I was going to give it another try. I'm a gnome magician, with an INT of 222 and a CHA of 115, so I figgured that this would be easier than the last time (Bards have many good qualitites, but WIS and INT are not amoung them.) and I decided that brewing sounded fun.<br />
<br />
I'll skip all the middle part, clicking, dragging, loading bags, selling stuff (or not) bad to venders. Somewhere around 180 I thought to to myself 'hey, this is pretty cool'. Of couse, that wretched stretch between 190 and 210 nearly broke me, but I pressed on.<br />
<br />
It took about a month, and not as much plat as I would have thought, to get to 250. I was fortunate and made my Brewer's Trophy on the second attempt.<br />
<br />
So, I've comfortably settled into the life of a brewing gnome. I make QAT, GLM, and KC for sale in the bazaar. So far I've made back what I spent learning to brew and a tiddy sum besides. I'd never imagened that I'd enjoy makeing stuff to sell (and a fair portion to give out to my fellow guild members).<br />
<br />
Which of course brings me back to you fine folks here. I could not have done it without you. Where do those mushrooms grow for KC? I found out here. What's the best path for skilling up? I found out here. What do I need to make Bayle's Delight? Right here again.<br />
<br />
I haven't gone to any of the places in the new expansion, a 32nd level mage should stay away from the frontier, but I'm looking forward to going out there with my bard and having a quick look see. I'm going to try those teas out, and the lemonaid looks interesting....<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
