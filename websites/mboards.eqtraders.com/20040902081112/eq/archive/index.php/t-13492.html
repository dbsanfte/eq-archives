<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious to see how other people fair with Tae Ew Chain and weapons.  <br />
I am at a 226 skill with geerlock, and I am like 1/15 so far.  I'm not sure if I just had a really bad RNG encounter or if this stuff is just really hard to make.<br />
Any other people have the same problem, or am I just trying this stuff to soon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mahlig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*** WARNING:  Small Sample Size *** <br />
<br />
I was 2 for 4 on Chain Tunics with 220+Geerlock (2 for 3 on shields...and 0 for 2 on shields at 210+Geerlock).  I will add more numbers here as I make more items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done 2 batches of tae ew shields, no other types of tae ew.  First time I started at 220.  I had 6 combines, got 5 successes and 2 skill ups.  Second time (which happened to be this morning), I started at 231 and had 9 combines.  I was successful on 5 shields and zero skill ups.  66% average success rate for me so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cavel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WEll Either you had a very Bad run with the RNG or I have had some very good runs. I am at around 50% on Tae Ew Chain items ATM and around 60-75% on the shields. I have seen no need to make any of the weapons at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EchtelionFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">223/224 skill, 14 combines, 6 successes, 0 skillups.<br />
<br />
Much better than cultural or sickles, but market is flooded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Utope Eljugador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hopefully the introduction of the zerker class will help bolster the tae ew chain market a bit.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm 2/6 on chain leggings. I've got 27 blood vials atm, when I get 60 or 80 I'll make a good run at it. I'm 235 skill atm, but I dont use geerlocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nolrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why don't you use geerloks?<br />
<br />
I had smiths make two pieces for me.  Leggings and coif.  They both had 250 smithing skill, and were successful on the first try.  I don't know if they used a geerlok or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Utope Eljugador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">mm.. dunno. Laziness, superstition, stat loss (int), bag space, all 4? I'll get my smithing and tailoring trophies once I'm done and my fletching one eventually. But I'm not terribly concerned about a 5% mod. I'd use them if they were 10% but out of sheer laziness 5% isnt worth it (for me) unless I was 240.<br />
<br />
Amazing isnt it that I'm too lazy to use a geerlok but I'll farm greens for days just to work on tradeskills? My friends cant figure it out either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ColdHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">first time; 226 +5%<br />
4/6 tunics, 2/4 Leggings, 0/2 sleeves 50%<br />
<br />
since then, 1/5 on leggings, 3/4 on sword, 1/3 on shield. <br />
<br />
Heraldic BPs are teh win however, 0/6 :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xaanru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I typically have an 80% success rate on tae ew, at 250 skill+ trophy. However, its streaky, and I've had 20 straight successes, and as bad as 3/8. Note, I've made over 200 pieces of tae ew, and over time the 80% seems to be the average.<br />
<br />
So anyone with 240+ geerlok, or higher, would have similar results over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ok...I tried again and was 2/3 on tunics and 2/3 on shields.  That makes me feel a lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ragweed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I got bored and tried a chain tunic.  183 smithing, also holding geerlok.  Success!  :eek:<br />
<br />
Won't be doing that any more until I max smithing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kuronekosama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've made probably a few hundred tae pieces.  This includes, chain armor, weapons, and shields.  For each item the success rate seems the same.  I would say I get about 85% success at 250 skill + 5%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">250+geerlok<br />
<br />
Tunic: 5/5<br />
Shield: 2/2<br />
<br />
Wheee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slippyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">216 + geerlok.<br />
<br />
4 for 6 on tunics.  Only pieces I've ever made.</div></div><hr />
