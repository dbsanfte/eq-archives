<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all. I started a young enchanter a couple weeks ago, and have a few questions on research. I've maxed him out at 45 (level 24) and am looking at my level 29 research spell &quot;Feedback&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, I will also buy spells in the bazaar when I see a good deal, and in fact I have ALL enchanter &quot;Research only&quot; spells up through 49 already, and didn't pay more than 40PP for a spell. Heh, and 40pp was ONE spell, all the rest were under 20pp.<br />
<br />
There were three exceptions.<br />
<br />
Level 16 Mesmerization<br />
Level 24 Strip Enchantment<br />
Level 29 Feedback.<br />
<br />
It took WEEKS, but I finally found the pages I needed to research Mesmerization so I didn't have to pay 1000pp in the bazaar! That's right, I see it occasionally for 1000pp. I've now found a good drop location, and have made several copies I've sold in the bazaar since then.<br />
<br />
I NEVER saw Strip Enchantment, and finally made one for myself after four tries... Those pages aren't easy to come by either.<br />
<br />
Here's the Ludicrous part. Feedback is regularly sold in the bazaar by ONE person, and it's marked at 2750pp. :eek: :eek: <br />
<br />
That's nuts! It requires Velishoul's Tome pages 108 and 109. I've managed to merchant mine many page 109's, but not a SINGLE page 108!!! Which brought me to a revelation. Something tells me I can only get page 108 from &quot;Faded Velishoul's Tome&quot; pages... :( <br />
<br />
Am I right? And if so, WHAT is the trivial on researching faded Velishoul pages??? There are several &quot;Salil's Writ&quot; pages that I've found one side for, but not a single copy of the other side. Is this another page I can only get from converting &quot;Faded Salil's Writ&quot; pages? <br />
<br />
I think I'm right, and have been stockpiling faded pages at every opportunity. The first thing I do when I log on is do a merchant mining run through the most common areas. I've got quite a stock of Salil's pages (5 different faded pages if I recall correctly), but only a few Faded Velishoul's pages (Only 2 different faded pages). Just not as many of them out there I guess. And of course, those are the ones I'm going to need in a few levels! ARGH!<br />
<br />
And why the hell is a certain spells research trivial SO much higher than the spell level? Sorry, had to through in one real whine while I was at it. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Correct Velious Tome Page 108 is one of the two faded Velious pages. And there are 5 faded Salils.<br />
<br />
Simply put the faded Velious in the chanter research book by itself, and hit combine. It trivials between 120 and 122... which is annoying.<br />
<br />
As to why the vendor has the spell marked so high... no clue. Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I suspected as much. Thanks for confirming it. I think I'll have a high level enchanter friend do the velishoul's tome pages for me. :) I need them to much to fail virtually every attempt with my meager research skill.<br />
<br />
I've skilled up nearly all my points using faded pages, and succeeded like twice out of I don't even know how many... :p Including quite a few wasted Velishoul's faded pages. DOH! Now I know better.<br />
<br />
I'll just use Salil's Faded Pages to skill up on. Got almost 100 of them now... :eek: LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Melinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I never bothered trying to do my research until my later levels.. just got sooo frustrated trying to gather the right pages and the shortness of cash. I didnt break the 1kpp barrier until this past summer..and I have been playing 3 years! <br />
Since the invention of the shared slots the cash flow and page exchange is easier between characters. If a page drops and there is no enchantie in the group I will always ask if i could have the enc pages for my main. normally I do not have any agruements. (need before greed tho). LDON allows for more drops and everything is looted... you have a much better chance of finding what you need for skill ups on the merchants.<br />
Faded pages are great for skill ups!<br />
I myself FINALLY broke 100 yesterday (happy dance!) :p  It only took me 52 levels to do it. ;) <br />
Dont rush it! If you have a guildie able to do the combine and you are in a bind... do not be afraid to ask!<br />
<br />
:angel: Happy Holidays</div></div><hr />
