<br />
I 2 box all the time,  but not what people usually do.... I play my chanter and put my druid up to forage.  I all have to do is reach over and hit my forage hot key and collect goodies, but I don't wanna worry 2 much about dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't check the foraging stuff on the main site, because it's blocked at work. However, I thought mushrooms were foraged on the moon. IE Nexus, Bazaar, Shadowhaven, etc...<br />
<br />
I could swear my druid has foraged them in SH. *shrug* Could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Actually they're foraged in any Luclin zone but not the nexus or the bazaar. Unless you count a really good deal on mushrooms a &quot;vendor forage.&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naeadiene Needsamap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you zone into Echo Caverns from Shadow Haven (near the soulbinder) there are two guards at the entrance.  I have stood in the corner behind them with hide up and foraged.  In fact I have had my daughter doing it for me.  (This was only a problem when she began spamming the zone iwth the wrong hot key lol)<br />
<br />
Pretty safe there in hide mode and not too many trains in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moonlilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tend to get alot at the Vah Shir outpost in Grimling Forest when I'm on my druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vruss Scalesmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a tip for you instead of having to hit your forage hotkey, you can open your options window and change some keystrokes around to where you forage whenever you do another common function. I have mine tied into whenever I move forward I automatically forage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lanalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I foraged them in Shadowhaven. It's safe there, and you can go afk and not worry about getting trained. :)<br />
<br />
Of course, naturally they're MUCH more easily foraged in Vex Thal.. but I didn't get keyed until my baking was past 202. Wah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Echo Caverns is the best place I've seen.  The forage table there is very small, so mushrooms turn up more often.<br />

<br />
Also note they can't be foraged in The Grey.<br />
<br />
Besides Luclin, mushrooms can also be foraged in Veksar.<br />
<br />
As for best place to forage them, go for zones where are few competing forages.  Recommend Echo Caverns or Shadowhaven.  Grieg's End not too bad either, last raid I went on there got quite a few mushrooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noni DeeCups</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would pick Shadowhaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Echo Caverns is the spot, due to the tiny forage table.  Back when I hunted for mushrooms I remember getting many more mushrooms there than in Shadow Haven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I foraged a mess of mushrooms in Paludal.  Sure, there was a bit of junk, but a lot of my forages have yielded mushrooms.  I used to sell them, but now that my baking is getting high enough, I've been sticking them into the shared bank and will use them to get the SK to 200 on his baking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Elowijn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hi there everybody,<br />
<br />
i dinged 200 in baking yesterday with my bard making truffles :sing: <br />
<br />
I tried to forage some shroms with my lvl17 druid and didn't get one mushroom within an hour in echo caverns and shadowhaven :/<br />
With my main even with his lower foraging skill i found about 5 mushrooms while baking in SH.<br />
<br />
It is a little confusing to me that a lvl65 bard with a forage skill of 55 finds more shrooms than a lvl17 druid with a skill of &gt;80 ... is this just the sometimes evil RNG?<br />
<br />
I wonder wether to forage with my bard or with the little druid :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the rng is always evil.  sometimes is plays nice so it can stab you in the back later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rerashyaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Fungus Grove is also a good place to scrounge up mushrooms. No feathers, owlbear dung, or ancient tarnished coins, plus there's a safe spot at the zone in town.<br />
