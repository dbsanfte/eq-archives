<br />
Sell them of course!  If you want robes I have robes you want 10 I got 10, you want 20 I can do that... you want 50 you say?  Sure np... you get the picture...<br />
<br />
If you want to buy in bulk I am willing to sell in bulk )  Trades for sickles is something I will accept.<br />
<br />
I can make 8 of 9 gifts assuming I have materials the only gift I can't make easily is the sickle &amp;lt;surprise surprise&gt; but I am working on that )<br />
<br />
Send me a tell or a PM and we can work out a deal...<br />
<br />
PS - Thanks Verdi for solving the 8th shawl &amp;lt;grin&gt; I read your post and it helped me quite a bit )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LadyAz</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also finding myself with extra solstice robes in my quest for tailoring skill. Instead of undercutting everyone on the market, I would rather trade them. Hopefully a trade could help those who cant afford the pp for the quest item and help me aquire more trade supplies.<br />
<br />
I would take most anything for trades, although here are a few things that would help my tailoring along. HQ brute hides, BD's (like who doesnt need them), flawless rockhopper hides, small bricks of acrylia (or in any form), othmir fur, colbalt drakes hides, etc.. My skill is currently 190 and I am looking to 250 tailoring for the cultural items I can make (and share).<br />
