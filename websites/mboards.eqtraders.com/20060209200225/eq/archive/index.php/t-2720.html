<br />
Do you exist?<br />
<br />
I'm interested in purchasing some of the nifty Serene Woven Platinum Armor, but can't think of any Erudite GM tailors, or really, even anyone who can imbue topaz (Quellious) for them.<br />

While this may have changed recently, I doubt it.  I do know we have several folks in the upper 100s that were going to make a tailoring push, but I don't think any of them have broken the 200 barrier.<br />
<br />
Also, none of the ones I know are clerics of Quellious, so that will be another hurdle.  We *did* find an erudite cleric a year or so ago able to imbue some topaz for us, but I've since lost track of the name.  When and if Ngreth's wizzie gets back to doing a tailoring push or 30 to skill up, we'll have to hunt up an imbuer again.</div></div><hr />

Though I have not worked on her tailoring in a while (got material waiting to be combined) and she is going to VS...<br />

I am not going to steal her thunder by announcing who it is, I'll save that for her. She has, however, succeeded in two out of three combines so far for me. I am now the proud owner of a Fulvous Steelweave Breastplate and Boots. They're gold in colour, more golden than the yellow of Deepwater and looks pretty good with the purple of Blood Lord's.<br />

Well maybe thats not the right way to go about it. Perhaps if she's interested, could you forward my name please. There are a couple pieces I'd love to have. <br />

My name in game is Hirang. BTW nice to see you're still around Niz, if you remember me at all from ToTF.</div></div><hr />

I'm always glad to do combines, cultural or not.  As far as getting topaz imbued, you might have to bite the bullet and start a cleric of quellious.   If you can get a friend or two to help you, it shouldn't take too long to get to 29.</div></div><hr />
