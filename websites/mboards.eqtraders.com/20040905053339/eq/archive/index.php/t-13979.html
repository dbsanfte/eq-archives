I have a quest that needs these to do the combine, but no clue how to get them.<br />
<br />
I tried using a regular tinkered &quot;Gem Cutter&quot; but that item is size MEDIUM and the combine container only takes TINY items.<br />

(This is Fezbin Fizzles quest in Abysmal, anyone can hail him to get the container)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gnormy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fezbin is a dork - the quest is both level restricted to 50+ and you must have successfully completed LDoN adventures.  Without meeting these requirements - this gnome wont talk to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rainingdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does he mean these I wonder? Gem Setter Parts (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4172)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Simplizius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think he means a  Gemcutter (http://www.eqtraders.com/search/reverse_recipe_search.php?item=4141&amp;menustr=035000000000)</div></div><hr />

I, too, had a chat with Fezbin tonight, and then chatted with the three folks he mentioned. I haven't done any research on this quest, but it sure seems like it's going to be very long. The three branches of the quest each involve multiple zones. The least of my worries is the set of tools he asks for :) I have a feeling that in completing the sub-quests the tool he wants will become apparent.</div></div><hr />
