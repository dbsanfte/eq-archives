 For those of you who do not know yet there is a 'Taxi' channel open 24/7 now started by my IRL hubby and myself. To log in type /join taxi. Those who want to sell their port/tp services are always welcomed and will be on hand to take you where you want to go.I have been busy so I have not been porting much lately but if you see me say hello!! <br />
Now, about items for sale-<br />
leather padding,swirling mist,brownie parts, foraged items of all kinds-just send me a tell in-game with your order. I will fill it asap !!<br />
<br />
I am always on the lookout for Morning dews,oak barks, and any kind of sabertooth tiger hides. Trying to go for GM in Woodelven sewing so I need all I can get!! <br />
<br />
Thanks and hope to hear from alot of you in-game</div></div><hr />

I believe she had a previous post on the Ezboard Eqtrader's thread. ~.^<br />

500 per stack has been my typical price thus far.</div></div><hr />
