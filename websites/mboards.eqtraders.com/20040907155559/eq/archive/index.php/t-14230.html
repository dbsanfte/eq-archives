<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After trying theese out for a while, here's my comments.<br />
Most traps are named &quot;Crab Trap&quot; and will will give up to 3 various sized crabs. Sometimes they give rusty daggers, or nothing at all.<br />
<br />
An uncommon spawn is named &quot;Battered Crab Trap&quot;, and I have seen them spawn in maybe 1 of 30 traps. Of the 3 times I got them, they contained 2-3 Cloth Cap.<br />
<br />
I belive &quot;Battered Crab Trap&quot; is an uncommon spawn with an uncommon/ rare drop yet to be discoered, with Cloth Caps as the common loot.<br />
<br />
There you go, time to swim and see if you can find them :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cmcsess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think alot of times where the loot is cloth armor it may be that the loot that is supposed to be dropped is either bugged or hasn't been entered into the loot table yet, so these may be worth checking from time to time.  If I remember correctly there were a few cases in the past where cloth armor was commonly dropping from high level mobs for awhile, Ldon hard missions were one if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My first visit to the Crab Traps resulted in a 9lb Crab and a rusty dagger. Otherwise the traps have been empty.<br />
Keep us all posted of what you find in them so we can keep each other up to date.<br />
They are empty 95% of the time for me.<br />
I only found 2 traps so far at the rear of the boat (could be front. I dive of platform in opposite direction fro fish hanging on line and i head south).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Froni Thunderpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe the beer-battered crab trap is the rare spawn.<br />
<br />
someone had to say it<br />
<br />
didn't they?<br />
<br />
I think I have graduated to bonkers today.</div></div><hr />
