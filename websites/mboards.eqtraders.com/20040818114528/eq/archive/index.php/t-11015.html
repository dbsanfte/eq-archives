<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize that Tinkers cannot gain skill until they are 16th level.  However, prior to that, do they function as a zeroeth level tinker or a 50th level tinker.<br />
<br />
I play a Wood Elf ranger and there is some overlap between my cultural abilities (e.g., forage) and my class abilities.  I was able to forage better at level 1 than my class would allow.  I am wodnering if a level 1 Gnome has this same innate level 50, or if at 15th level they are still zero, and then suddenly, at 16th, they jump up to 50.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, this would be a Cam Bot for now.<br />
<br />
Curiously,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool, thanks.  Then this seems a way to lower my fletching costs a bit, at even at 45% chance of success, tinkered cams seem to price out more cheaply.<br />
<br />
And then maybe I can play with my gnome a bit too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for a good tinker-oriented class for getting up to 16th level quickly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cerpicio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are going to max tinkering, an INT or WIS class would probably be best.  A cleric should be able to get to 16 pretty easily, but you might consider a mage.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My tinker-bot is a mage and I had so much fun levelling her up, I went to 20.  Then I lost my kei and parked her by the gunthak geerlok seller!  LOL :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
For a tinker-bot you want to max either int or wis so pick a class that you can get items cheap, since you don't care about other stats.  It's been a long time but I think wis is probably easier and cheaper to gear up with, so cleric might be easiest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Made my tinkerer a mage and levelled her up insanely fast (using a 65 Cleric). Twinked her to 255 int and went to the mid 160s in tinkering in the span of 3-4 days. Then I got re-hooked on my Cleric and LDoN came out....but honestly, I do plan on hitting 250 eventually with her ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GnomedeGuerre is a 15th level wizard now, just an hour or so from becoming a permanent Tinkerbot.  It was a nice way for a ranger-player to see what it's like to cast-sit-cast-sit, to see how hard it can be to NOT have the option of slashing one's way out of a jam, etc., but I think I prefer my own journey of advancement through my ranger to that of this nice little tinker to be.<br />
<br />
Edit: Got to 16th and more or less flew to Tinkering of 104, enough to make Cams at a high rate of success.  Nice to have a gnome on my side!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mistofelees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to play a Barby Shaman and a Hobbit druid.  I was curious so I made a tinker bot, not intending to play.  Mistofelees the Enchanter was born.  It was not long before I retired all but Mistofelees.  Enchanters not only rock as a class, they are relatively easy to get int up to max and they have the bonus of Enchanting and creating mana vials.  My money is on Chanters for Tinker Bots<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Emeraldeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My tinker bot Lexippixel is also a chanter. I selected him for his ability to make mana vials, and enchant metals for JC in addition to his tinkering ability. He was fairly easy to level to his current level of 27. Strangely enough he has become more of an alter ego to my main and therefore he is now much more than a bot now :) . It is a definite change from my Ranger main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arrica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe, lots of Ranger mains with tinkerbot alts. :D  We don't need bow cams, do we? :p <br />
<br />
I actually went wizzy, as when I first started my tinkerbot it wasn't with the intention of making her slave over her toolboxes all day, but with actually playing.  Though, through a combination of circumstances, about the time I hit 30, I started playing my Ranger more and more, though, last night I did dust Sorlea off for a dungeon run with guildie alts (ding 31! woo, just wish my int had gone up on some of my items that I don't yet meet rec level for).  I also find a wizzy to be handy because I can port around to wherever I need to go.  Need LoY tinkering parts?  She's bound in the Lighthouse.  Need Luclin parts?  Nexus Gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tinile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well yes, enchanter would be a good choice, but I already had one, and don't like duplicating.  :)<br />
<br />
My gnome doesn't leave the gunthak lighthouse.  She is bound in PoK for emergencies, but I camp her near the geerlok seller.  I also plan on leaving every other skill on the gnome at zero.  My druid main does all the subcombines for tinkering and all the shopping and we do a lot of shared bank switching.  It takes a long time, due to many non-stacking components, but it is the best solution for me.  Also the gnome has terrible CHA, so buying with the main is much more cost effective. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My gnome is a necromancer.  He’s only level 20, but I really would like to level him up some day.  The necromancer class has a lot to offer and a gnome necromancer isn’t hated as much as most.  I love being able to walk around equally well in Freeport or the dark elf city.  At the moment I have a 51 druid, 51 ranger, 54 beastlord and 61 shaman working on AAs.  So I’m not sure when my poor little necromancer will see the light of day.  But then, as a necromancer he perfectly happy sitting in the dark. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ooh, gosh...I didn't think about making a gnome enchanter...I have a chanter bot but she's only lvl 9....and I wanted to take her higher anyway...<br />
<br />
But if I made a gnome chanter, then I could get the tinker bot as well as my chanter bot in one. =)<br />
<br />
I'm liking this idea...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eniamn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">gu lol. mains a wizard.  <br />
<br />
GnomedeGuerre is a 15th level wizard now, just an hour or so from becoming a permanent Tinkerbot. It was a nice way for a ranger-player to see what it's like to cast-sit-cast-sit, to see how hard it can be to NOT have the option of slashing one's way out of a jam, etc., but I think I prefer my own journey of advancement through my ranger to that of this nice little tinker to be. <br />
<br />
get him to 34 and learn to quad.  you will never sit again because you got 4 big an uglies coming to eat you.  1/3 of your life at least in ne round and then they might stun you as well and go again.  was wondering about a tinkerbot for me.  main has fletching at 155 and have a ranger alt i enjoy and want to gm fletching on both of them.  will ned cams.  i have a necro alt, a cleric alt, and a wizard main.  looks like it will be enchanter for me.  then i can make my own d@ng mana vials too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This brings up an unrelated question, which is what is the magic of Quad Kiting?  Why does no one Tri Kite?  Or Quint Kite?<br />
<br />
As a ranger, I can barely UniKite, unless I have like an hour to kill  (or it's an animal and I can fear it and melee as it runs), but what is the appeal of 4 versus some other number?</div></div><hr />

Many spells will affect a maximum of 4 targets.  <br />

Bards do mass kiting since their songs are ae...usually they'll charm a mob and kite as many as they can grab, singing AE dot, I think, while their charmed mob beats on one mob at a time...<br />
<br />
There's nothing better than getting trained by a mass kiting bard...=P</div></div><hr />

does about 218 dmg to up to four targets.  it is more efficient to use it on 2 targets than my single nukes on two targets.  i pull four because it can hit that many and anything more than 2 mobs, when this spell becomes better than anything else i have, is extra exp and loot for the same mana basically.  i am a wizard. at lv 29 we gets bonds of force.  it is an ae up to four targets snare.  wizard get so and tag mobs with an instant click effect from range to piss them off.  i use t-flux staff (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=57)  myself.  it has a 6 pt fire/cold debuff as well.  very low aggro but the debuff helps the nukes land.  anyway, with sow i outrun all the mobs and circle them until they are very close together.  then i smack them with the snare and nuke them dead.  druids i hear have single snares.  they snare and gather them snred becasue their spell lasts a lot longer than my ae one.  that is pretty much quad kiting in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
edit oh for those with bigger cahonas than me atm.  wizards can full speed quad too.  it gets very fun and very scary.  i only did it a few times and then made sure i was snaring them again.  full speed is crazy.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, lots of Ranger mains with tinkerbot alts. :D  We don't need bow cams, do we? :p <br />
  <br />
<br />
Oddly enough, im a ranger who has a tinkerbot, but i got my fletching to 250 BEFORE i made my little gnome cleric. I did the tinkering thing because there really wasnt anyone else on the server who was actively tinkering.<br />
<br />
After i got my tinkerer to 250, PoP came out, so i was called upon many times by the local uberguild to make cams. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kritta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Tinker Bot *sigh*<br />

I so wish it was level restricted as I so dislike that term. :rolleyes: But oh well, whatcha goina do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>andyhre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ah, but Kritta, you are an icon to us all!  We seek you praise and only hope to emulate your greatness!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cerrena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I started my gnome alt for two resons.  First because I wanted to tinker and second because I wanted to be a gnome.  <br />
<br />
The very first character I ever created in EQ was a gnome on my Husbands account.  But I had no idea how to play. I wondered around for a bit.  Fell in the water.  Couldn't figure out how to swim and drowned.  I learned much faster later one when I go my own account and he could give me helpful suggestion such as 'look up'.<br />
<br />
But the point I started my gnome we were well into tradeskills.  So it was natural to try out tinkering as we had no experience with it.  I made the gnome an echanter because it was the class least like the warrior I had been playing up to that point.  Well my tinkering gnome enchanter is now level 60 and my baking halfling warrior is only 58 so I guess she hardly fits the category of tinkering-bot.<br />
<br />
BTW - Chenier, with a name like Tarteene you're going to have to teach her to bake as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Of course we love you, Kritta. You are the Tinkering Goddess. =)<br />
<br />
But theres a difference between a Tinkerer and a Tinkerbot.<br />
<br />
A lvl 50+ warrior wearing actual HP/AC/Resist gear, goes out an hunts and levels, and also makes nifty gadgets... thats a Tinkerer.<br />
<br />
A lvl 65 300+ AA wizard decked out in Elemental/Plane of Time gear and makes Shrinkers for his guild... thats a Tinkerer.<br />
<br />
A lvl 16 cleric that was pled to lvl 16 a year ago, hasnt cast a heal spell her whole life, has 0 in all casting skills, and wears a CHA mug, a Geerlok and has 24 Deluxe Toolkits.... thats my Tinkerbot. =)</div></div><hr />

*wipes laughing tears from her little eyes with a huge grin*<br />
<br />
You guys crack me up. :)<br />
<br />
As for tinkerbots, I don't care if you have one ... just don't undercut me in the bazaar and all will be well with the world. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">/lubs on Kritta<br />
<br />
Tarteene has ended up as a level 29 enchanter. She enchanted a ton of mana vials and clay for me and this last weekend, made 40 gazillion standard bow cams.<br />
<br />
I leveled her up a bit in tinkering (somwhere around 105) and bought her a tinkering geerlok to help out. I have absolutely no intention of using her to make stuff to sell in the bazaar and undercut you! (my standard items to make and sell for cash are woodie BD cultural armor and MTP, because they stack)<br />
<br />
But now that I'm done with both pottery and fletching (well, until I get to the Aid Grimel test), I can just have fun with Tart =)<br />
