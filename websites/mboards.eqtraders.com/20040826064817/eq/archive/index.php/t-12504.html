wtf??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That would be a joke regarding the problems with the last major patch.  <br />
<br />
I fell outta the chair when I saw it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know it's a joke, and I know what it's in reference too...<br />
<br />
However, I'm not amused. *shrug*<br />
<br />
A lot of people are, and that's great, but for some reason it just annoys me.<br />
<br />
Ah well, it's not my comic, and I've had tons of laughs from his work before and I know I will again. I'm just going to sit back and wait for #101.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i love wtf. my bf even likes wtf. they are so on my list of 'people i would give money to, if i had any to spare'. <br />
<br />
<br />
i thought this comic was funny. i don't really see why people wouldn't, but recently i'm not so good at getting in people's heads. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

This is just in line with the strip, naught to do with the patch.  Was it changed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to ask the same question.<br />
<br />
It was originally  a big black &quot;YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED&quot; screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
It has since been replaced with a comic.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Farnyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really did laugh out loud when I saw #100 this morning because it was the &quot;You Have Been Disconnected&quot; screen we are all familiar with...and despise! Was a bit disappointed and thought &quot;Aww man! I wanted a comic&quot;. Glad to see he put up a real one. Now if only he could/would update more often...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Run around Erudin and Erudin castle hailing NPCs.<br />
<br />
You'll find that what the Erudite is talking about doing to Straha--that's actually how executions in Erudin take place.<br />
<br />
A lot of Antoin's RP is based around that fact.</div></div><hr />

They pull the evil out of you, and set you adrift in a boat.   All of their &quot;scientific knowledge&quot;  has indicated that evil can be &quot;cured&quot;  By pulling your entrails out.<br />

<br />
&quot;But sir, how is that supposed to cure him of being evil?&quot; the young paladin asked her mentor.<br />
<br />
The plate-clad noble turned to look at her, and with a twinkle in his eye responded &quot;I'll tell you what.  He does anything else evil after this, we'll stop doing this.  Until then, it *does* work in the curing of evil, doesn't it?&quot;</div></div><hr />

And they're the nice erudites. We Heretics are much more...creative in our punishments.</div></div><hr />
