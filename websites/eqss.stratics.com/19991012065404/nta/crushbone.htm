                    extremely popular zone located in the <strong>Greater

                    (the High Elf City)/<strong>Kelethin</strong>
                    (the Wood Elf city) region. The entrance is
                    located on the north wall of the <strong>Greater
                    Faydark</strong> zone, near <strong>Kelethin</strong>.
                    It's something of a &quot;dungeon&quot; zone
                    since there is only one entrance, and the
                    only thing to be found inside is Orcs, Orcs,
                    and more Orcs :-). No cities, merchants, or
                    even roads or paths can be found anywhere in
                    the zone. This zone is suitable for levels
                    8-15+, if you know what and where to hunt.
                    And that is exactly what this guide is here

                    basic shape of <strong>Crushbone</strong> is
                    something like a circle. Starting at the
                    entrance facing out, if you head left you'll
                    cross a bridge and eventually enter the
                    slaving camp. Go around the slaving camp, and
                    you'll find yourself on the far side of the
                    palace, home of Emperor Crush. Going around
                    the palace , and then taking the path there
                    will lead you back to the main entrance of
                    the zone. In the center is a large hill, with
                    a orc campsite on top, and underneath the
                    hill is a series of tunnel that houses some
                    Orc Slavers. As you can see, <strong>Crushbone</strong>
                    is a relatively small zone, but it's still a
                    good place to hunt.</font></p>

                    <strong>Crushbone</strong> is a wonderful
                    zone to get both good experience and loot,
                    one thing to be very wary of is trains. Since
                    some of you may be scratching your heads at
                    this point and wondering what in the world a
                    train is, I'll tell you :-). A train is what
                    occurs when a player gets more monsters than
                    he can handle (say 2 or 3) and begins to run
                    back to the zone boundary in order to escape.
                    The problem though, is that when he runs by
                    other monsters standing idly about, they too
                    join in the chase. Soon you'll have a player
                    running in the front, with anywhere from 5-15
                    monsters hot on his tail. Once the one who is
                    being pursued either dies, or zones, that
                    group of monsters soon turns their attention
                    to others around them, and massive fatalities
                    often result. On top of all this, these
                    trains often occur when a high level group is
                    hunting the toughest monster in the zone, and
                    they end up running. So not only do you have
                    5-15 monsters, but alot of the time these
                    monsters are the hardest in the zone! You can
                    appreiciate now why many people immediately
                    take cover when &quot;TRAIN!&quot; is shouted
                    throughout the zone. If you ever hear this
                    phrase uttered, be prepared to take immediate
                    cover, or you may be in for a long walk back
                    to your corpse.</font></p>

                    that you're aware of what trains are and the
                    dangers they pose, it's time for some
                    specific hunting strategies. First off, I
                    recommend that you don't attempt to come into
                    this zone until at least level 7. Up until
                    then, it is far too risky, and you'll find
                    yourself running and zoning more than you
                    will be hunting. If you want to try out some
                    Orcs before this level, try hanging out in
                    the area right outside <strong>Crushbone</strong>,
                    in <strong>Greater Faydark</strong>.</font></p>

                    7-10 should hunt Orc Centurions solo for the
                    most part. Orc Centurions can be found just
                    about anywhere in the zone, but I recommend
                    you take a quick left while coming out of the
                    entrance area, and go across the bridge
                    there. Several Orc Centurions regularly spawn
                    here, so it's a good spot. For more
                    Centurions, go over to the slaver's area.
                    Also, if you're in a group of 2-3, you might
                    want to try taking on the Orc Slaver which is
                    found in one of the buildings in that area.
                    Be careful though, as it's toughness varies
                    quite a bit, and while he may of been an easy
                    kill for you last time, this time he might
                    eat you for breakfast without taking a
                    scratch. </font></p>

                    you're in the level 11-15 range, you have
                    quite a few options. You can continue hunting
                    Orc Centurions, as there are some that are
                    higher leveled than others (such as those on
                    the hill near the trainer). Also, the Orc
                    Legionnaires should be a prime target in this
                    range, as they're pretty much ideal for 12+.
                    The Legionnaires are generally found around
                    the palace, patrolling around the walls. Many
                    players like to go on top of the hill in the
                    center of the zone, and hunt the Orc Trainer
                    that spawns there. The reason for this is is
                    that he sometimes gives out the Shiny Brass
                    Shield, a magic shield that has 10 AC, 10
                    magic resistance, and also gives off light.
                    However, it's pretty hard because there are
                    often many people there competing, plus the
                    fact that he doesn't have it in his loot
                    every time. Another place you might try at
                    this level is in the tunnel complex
                    underneath the hill. You'll find Centurions
                    and Orc Slavers within. Lastly, you can group
                    up with other higher-level folks and attempt
                    to go into the castle itself. Inside you can
                    find many tough Orcs, including the Emissary,
                    the Prophet, Ambassador D'Vinn (a high level
                    Dark Elf NPC), the Emperor's Royal Guard (how
                    does backstabbing for 40 damage sound as you
                    try to escape?), the Warlord, and of course
                    Emperor Crush himself. All I can say is that
                    if you decide to do this, be extremely
                    cautious at all times.</font></p>
