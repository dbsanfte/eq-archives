                    generations deep within the caves of <strong>Ak'Anon</strong>,
                    gnomes have developed clockwork technology
                    unmatched anywhere in the known world. They
                    spend so much time tinkering up these
                    inventions, they've even created creatures to
                    give directions to weary travelers so the
                    gnomes will not have to pause in their
                    labors. These clockwork guides are essential
                    for those new to <strong>Ak'Anon</strong>.
                    Learn how to use them and you will never need
                    a cartographer's service again while you
                    venture within this town. Simply
                    &quot;hail&quot; them and ask about your
                    destination (target a clockwork guide and,
                    for example, ask &quot;Where is the
                    bank?&quot;) and they will immediately summon
                    your information. Even though these guides
                    are quite helpful, some visitors may need a
                    bit of assistance, so I shall do my best to
                    accommodate you and so I may promptly return

                    some light onto this area. You see, The

                    clockworks which can guard, clean, guide and
                    even buy and sell, but this comes with a
                    price--not all of their creations work
                    properly. A small amount fail to live up to
                    the Eldritch name and stop functioning
                    correctly. In some cases, these clockworks
                    will turn on their masters and lash out.
                    These abominations are thrown into the Mines
                    of Malfunction for brave adventurers to have
                    what they will with them. It has been rumored
                    that the mines are infested with snakes,
                    spiders and animated skeletons. Many gnomes
                    refer to the mines as the Basement if they
                    say anything about it in the first place.</font></p>
