Hail Aegis Lux,<br>Just thought I would let you all know that my new Guild has been approved.  And as you may have guessed the name is Karanan Empire (Roman Empire was declined).  The Guild is not composed of members that follow Karana so yes anyone can join.  Unlike Aegis Lux we do allow Necros and Shadow Knights as we go by the merit of the person and not by their class or race.  Now all I have to do is meet with the members and contact the GM and we are "live".  BTW Errol, I'm not sure if you have my new Email address, it is armanalla-silverwolf@home.com<br><br>Armanella Silverwolf<br>Master Archer<br>43rd Ranger of Karana<br>Keeper of the Flame<br>Emperor of the Karanan Empire

Congratulations Armanella.<br><br>But I must also concur with Jantunen. The server is rampant with guilds, who contributes with nothing else than yet another tag.<br><br>I am not saying the Karanan Empire is such a guild, but I must admit I have yet to see a new guild with a really original and "in-the-spirit" charter. Aegis Lux was from the beginning just another "good" guild determined to try and play on the Good vs. Evil theme that permeates all fantasy litterature. Not that original - but, I had all of the Charter written and an entire background story, plus the hierachical (sp?) structure ready. I knew what I wanted and those who voted for the guild knew it to and almost all joined me afterwards in Aegis Lux.<br><br>Seems to me all you need today is 10 people (who vote and thats it) and doesn't even have to show that they're members afterwards. We don't need more guilds. We need more dedicated players ;-) and the Guilds already made, gotta deliver..<br><br><b>Errol Flynn</b><br>Pathfinder of Tunares Mercy<br><br><i>"That wasn't a bad pull...it was a CHALLENGING pull"</i>

I have yet to find a Guild that has really done anything. Most don't work together and tend to push members to the side when they ask for help.  The problem isn't there are too many Guilds, the problem is there are too many poorly run Guilds.  That is all I have to say :-)<br><br>(FYI, I'm not saying Aegis is poorly run... Just thought I'd clear that up)<br><br>Armanella Silverwolf<br>Master Archer<br>43rd Ranger of Karana<br>Keeper of the Flame<br>Emperor of the Karnan Empire

<b>Errol's view of a Guild (the narrow paternal approach) ;o) </b><br><br>Guilds need structure. Guilds need Leadership. And Guilds needs a goal, something to strive for.<br><br>Without that, "helping eachother" quickly grows stale, as members focus on powerlevelling, getting fancy gear and wants to Raid the Planes.<br><br>If the Guild does not support these simple developments AS WELL as being able to maintain a common sense of "unity", surrounding a charter and a set of guidelines, the point of the guild is moot. Then you might as well call it a "loot group" and be done with it...<br><br>When the Guild grows, the familiar strings keeping people together dissolve and if the guild doesn't grow, you will have one heckuva time going anywhere up-scale.<br><br>Make your decisions known and decide what you as a Leader wants. Do not fool yourself into believing its gonna be a democracy either, it will never be. You have the final say and if people will not respect that, your guild will quickly dissolve. State that from the beginning, so people know what to expect.<br><br>Between the Guilds goals and structure, the leadership and the personal desires of its members, you are the one who stays focused. Make your vision and strategy clear from the beginning. Choose your officers wisely and use them as sparring partners as much as you can, to help you make decisions. Good Officers are invaluable. You can't do everything yourself.<br><br>Members. Always pay strict attention to your members, as they are the reason you made the Guild in the first place. Make it a fun and challenging place to be. You are there for the members, NOT the other way around. Never forget that simple fact. Stay neutral and stay fair. Never take sides if at all possible. Although it can be darn tricky sometimes...<br><br>Its a balance, and a lot of hard work - but its worth it.<br><br>'ere endeth the lesson....<br><br>I wish you all the luck in the world Armanella. I am not saying my views are the only ones who work - its just my way. My reflections from running this guild for almost 2 years. (whoa!).<br><br>Should you ever want some constructive feedback, drop me a mail or a tell. I'll be there.<br><br><br><b>Errol Flynn</b><br>Pathfinder of Tunares Mercy<br><br><i>"That wasn't a bad pull...it was a CHALLENGING pull"</i>

Trust me Errol I know you can't have more than 1 person making the important decisions, it just doesn't work.  And yes I agree with you on the points you made, there is no fun in just getting nice equipment or camps you have to have a purpose.  However believe it or not people do like to have something to work towards like someone getting their Soulfire and what not.  It's not always a individual acomplishment, but that of the group as a whole.<br><br>Armanella Silverwolf<br>Master Archer<br>43rd Ranger of Karana<br>Keeper of the Flame<br>Emperor of the Karnan Empire

A guild also needs an identity. Without it, a guild is nothing more than a collection of people running around wiht a common guild tag. The Order of Truth is one of the older guilds on the server now, they still exist today. Only reason I know they are still around is because they were the first guild I had ever joined, before leaving to form my beloved Hand of Truth. Why did I leave? They had no identity. Why are they still around today? Because enough alts that haven't been played in monthsstill carry the guild tag.<br><br>When a group of people lose their identity, they cease to exist. This is true of RL as well. When any nation, or ethnic culture loses its individuality and identity, they cease to exist. This has happened hundreds of times throughout history in RL. Entire cultures have simply vanished because they lost what was theirs. Most Americans don't understand the ethnic wars that rock Europe constantly. These are people fighting to maintain their identity, not allowing their culture to go the way so many have in the past.<br><br>Many guilds in EQ have gone the same way. As a guild, you have to know what you stand for, even if it is standing for simple social issues, or raiding. And you have to stick to your identity as that guild. For better or for worse. Take Unity of Twelve as prime example.<br><br>As a guild you make your bed and lay in it so to speak. You create your charter, you have certain ideals, roleplay or not, and you follow them. But when you lose sight of these, and allow too much change to take place, the guild often loses itself amd ceases to be. Then oyu have Unity of Twelve, ripping itself apart, or you have one of the countless mindless, purposeless, taking up space guilds that exist today.<br><br>Change is good, but there must be a constant, an underlying identity that remains throughout. Otherwise you will have to ask yourself <i>"Who are we?"</i>. And by the time you have to ask that question, it will most likely be too late. And remember, identity is not synonomous with ideal... and identity is often times much more the cherished of the two. Ideals come and go with the perspective (just realize that the person playing AVi sid that, not Avi himself).<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>Neal/Avi/Korach
