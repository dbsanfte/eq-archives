<p align="center" class="NewsTitle">A history of sorts </p>
<p>In the beginning Arnath ruled with benevolence. In Terra Lux – The Land of 
  Light - He was the Second King of the Noble High Elves – The true Fairborn Children. 
  Under his reign, wisdom and science thrived. People lived in harmony and Terra 
  Lux was blessed with enlightenment and Order. </p>
<p align="center" class="NewsTitle">So it came to pass that </p>
<p>Evil reared its ugly head. Chaos entered the World. The everturning Wheel of 
  Fate, demands that Balance must be attained. So The malicious races of Dark 
  Elves, the Black Brothers of the Fairborn, grew jealous of the rich Kingdom 
  of Light. They ammassed vast armies and set out to rid the World of the Fairborn. 
  They were led by Xargon of House K'Tarn. A Dark Elf with flaming ambitions. 
  He saw himself as the Bringer of Darkness a Reaper of Fairborn Souls. Spurred 
  by a believed Divine insight, he tamed the desire of the Dark Elves to suit 
  his quest for complete domination of the Lands of Light. </p>
<p align="center" class="NewsTitle">Fear and loathing </p>
<p>Grasped the hearts of The Fairborn. Terra Lux urged all Races of Good, to join 
  in the Battle against Xargon and his minions of Evil. The races of Good soon 
  acknowledged the danger that Xargon posed and armies was sent from Human Emperors, 
  Halfling BurrowKings and Wood Elf Princes. </p>
<p>The mighty armies of Light and Darkness clashed one dire midsummer morning. 
  The Dark Elves surprised the military strategists of their opponents, since 
  their numbers had grown and their ranks now swelled with unimaginable terrors. 
  Orcs, Goblins, Trolls and Ogres now fought alongside the Dark Elves. The promise 
  of the Fairborn treasures evident in their greedy eyes. The thirst for blood 
  on both sides was unrivaled. </p>
<p align="center" class="NewsTitle">Chaos and disorder </p>
<p>It is said that when the armies clashed, the thunder of battle and the cries 
  of the dying, could be heard even by The Dwarves in their Stone Halls, miles 
  beneath Norrath. Rivers of blood flowed, pain and suffering was great. Light 
  and Darkness fought bitterly. And in the end there was no winner. </p>
<p>Sorely pressed by the brilliant strategies of Xargon and the overwhelming numbers 
  of evil Races, the armies of Light retreated from the battle. The Fairborn sought 
  to the deep forests, the Humans hudled inside walled cities and Halflings dug 
  deeper burrows than ever before. But Darkness was hurt deeply too. Unable to 
  follow their enemies, the Evil races withdrew, hatred still burning in their 
  hearts, fueled by the promises of Xargon . Divide and conquer So, with the bitter 
  memory of the War in mind, the leaders of the Good Races came to the conclusion, 
  that they needed to anticipate and react before another such disaster would 
  occur. An elite corps was formed, consisting of the finest heroes each Race 
  of Good had to offer. A handpicked elite force working against Evil on their 
  terms. Warriors, Mages, Druids, Priests. All joined ranks and the Aegis Lux 
  – Shield of Light was born. </p>
<p>Through subterfuge and infiltration. Through bribery and trickery. With all 
  doors open and no holds barred. So shall the Aegis Lux keep Evil reined. </p>
