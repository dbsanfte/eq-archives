			It was one of those lazy warm days. The sun was burning from a hot sky, the flies were too lazy to fly, and there really was nothing much to do in the treehouse. What do I do? Fawna thought to herself... this heat is killing me. Then she got an idea, she summoned her powers and minutes later she stood in the icy regions of Velious. Now at least the heat was not killing her.<br><br>She had learned from previous tales that the Avatar of Tunare was to be found somewhere on this vast and only recently discovered continent, so she thought, what better to do that to find the Mother herself, and present herself as a loyal follower to her. Fawna summoned the spirit of the wolf upon herself, knowing that there were many, but slow dangers in these lands, and she took of to find Tunare. She led her intuition guide her, little knowing what grave mistake that would be, but before she knew it, she was standing at the gates of the giant city Kael Drakkan.<br><br>Now, Fawna did NOT want to go in there, but her intuition told her to do it, so ahead she went. She opened the door to this vast stronghold, realizing that she was alone among some 30 of the giantkin. Well she thought, giants had never been that clever, and she had Tunare on her side, so a little con game would be in place. She summoned her chameleon powers, trying to blend with the surroundings, and started running through the giant city.<br><br>The giants, dumb as they were never knew of her presence. This is going good she thought to herself, when she was suddenly faced with the choice of left or right... now, right would always be right, her intuition told her, and had it ever failed her before? As she wandered of the right path, wondering if her intuition actually HAD fooled her at some point, she was faced with Senior Seargant Red...whatshisname... He apparently did not like her little scheming game, so he decided to put and end to it. *sigh*<br><br>Luckily for Fawna, a good friend of her, tho practicioner of dark magic was nearby, and je was able to call her spirit before it got too far on its way, and before she knew it she was back in her earthly form again. Luckily it had happened so fast that her cute shell, did not take that much physical damage. She thanked her friend much (OOC Malsheen, you know who you are..) and once again set off to meet her deity.<br><br>She could definately feel the presence of Tunare being closer at this point, and her spirits were lifted. She ran through the vast forrest known as the Wakening Lands, knowing in her heart that Tunare was indeed close by. never had she in her travels seen so many kindred spirits. There were unicorns, nymphs, fauns, all creatures close to her heart, and none of them seemed disturbed by her presence. She finally came to a tower, in the middle of a lake. It was guarded by fauns, so she knew she was on to something here. She could feel the power from that tower...<br><br>She crossed the bridge, receiving short but approving nods from the guarding fauns. She climbed the stairs inside, and finally she stood before a portal. Now, having been at the portals of Fear just a few days before, she knew what to be expected of portals, but this portal filled her with a sense of peace, and joy. Without further thinking she stepped through.<br><br>Fawna entered a maelstrom of warm colors and dancing lights, and before she knew it she was standing on a rich and fertile field. This place was so alive. She could feel the live grow underneath her feet, and she knew that this was definately the place of the Mother. The first many hours she just spent walking around, in sheer amazement of this place, taking into her every sight she saw, and enjoyed it fully.<br><br>After some time of wandering Fawna found herself standing in front of an Ancient Totem. She saw right away that this creature was definately Tunares creation, she presented herself humbly to the totem, but all she got in return was "Wiggidy Waggidy Booh". She regretted all those times she failed to take the ancient totem language course, and after having tried several questions and gestures she set off by herself looking for her Deity.<br><br>She felt the power growing inside her, and she felt herself being dragged towards one particular large tree in the horizon. She sped up, running towards the tree, and it became clear to her that this tree must have been around since the dawn of time. Never in her life had she seen anything that big. Even the mighty giant strongholds, looked like miniature houses compared to this tree. Fawna knew she was getting close. After being saluted by alot of happy woodland beings running around at the foot of the tree, Fawna started climbing the ramp that was climbing around the tree. After a climb that seemed like ages, she finally stood before an opening in the tree. She was greeted by 2 panthers. Though their fur was black as coal, it still shined like that of a diamond. They gave a low growl, bowed their heads and emotioned Fawna to enter.<br><br>Fawna stood still like struck by lightning. There she was. The Mother of all, Tunare herself in her Avatar form. Fawna fell to her knees, she bowed her head before her, and saluted her presence. One thing that struck Fawna as kind of odd though, was that Tunare had chosen the form of a high elf as her Avatar shell. But hey, who was Fawna to judge. After having spent much time with Tunare, Fawna decided that she was needed elsewhere in the world, so she decided to leave. Thinking of it, it also seemed odd to Fawna that though she had been very talkative to Tunare, the Mother had not really said anything to her.<br><br>Fawna knew that Tunare was just nervous and did not not know how to break the ice. Why else would she summon Fawna to her side 3 times more that day? She never said anything though, but Fawna knew, that in time, that day will come.

			Greetings all,<br><br>first I would like to say I am sorry for the downtime, but I had to "resync" some database stuff and do alot of uploading to the site.<br><br>Though most of the changes arnt really visible to you guys (code/database cleanups etc) I do have a list of the new features and bug fixes with this update:<br><br><b>Bug Fixes:</b><br><i>- Fixed a bug in <b>change member info</b> where some names where missing from the primary character list.<br>- Fixed the bug in the <b>send pop-up note</b> which were showing way to many names.<br>- Fixed the bug that caused you to be forced to type in your email when going into <b>change member info</b>. Its not a mandatory field anymore.</i><br><br><b>New Features:</b><br><i>- Added <b>views</b> to the message boards so its now possible to see how many that have viewed any topics from this day and forth.<br>- Its now possible to add your own <b>signature</b> to your created messages. This is done by editing the <b>signature</b> field in your member info.<br>- Your IP-Address will now be "registret" along with your messages, so we can track you down if you spam us ;)<br>- Along with the IP-addresses its now possible to be "partial" banned from our site, meaning you will be restricted to a "view-only" view of our message boards.<br>- Poll can now be created as "guild only" or "all". If "guild only" polls are made you are only able to vote once and only if you login and then go to the <b>current news</b> to vote or the poll will only show the result for you (and always for other non-members). If the poll is created as "all" it works just as it has always done with the possible "cheating" feature.<br>- Wrong login tries on your member account will now be registret (with the IP-address) and info about this given to you when you login.<br>- A new feature has been added to the member section called, <b>Strategy menu</b>. This will give you access to a new menu containing a list of zone strategies (empty at the moment but strategies will hopefully be added later).<br></i><br><br>Well, I think that about covers the visible part for most of you... I might have forgotten something and I might also have created new errors along with all these changes - so please bear with me and tell me about any new/old errors you detect.

			Our Temporary Initiation stop is no longer in effect.<br><br>Not that we have gotten all the Clerics, Enchanters and Monks we need, far from it, but simply on the basis of the Council recieving a lot of Applications from people who have possible ties with potential applicants of precisely these classes.<br><br>Its only fair that we allow all classes equal access, so friends and allies can join on equal terms.<br><br>Also we have experienced a large rate of high-levels leaving Aegis to either pursue different goals or because we have the max. 2 Character rule.<br><br>So, we open up the doors, confident that with our new High and Medium Level Event Masters, our Allies and the general rise in member-dedication, we will be able to address the needs of all new and existing members for a challenging and fun Aegis Lux.<br><br>But, remember, if ye see a sad Cleric, Chanter or Monkie, drop him a tell and ask him if he or she has ever heard of the illustrious Aegis Lux...You never know ;-)<br><br>- Errol
