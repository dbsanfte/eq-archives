        <font color="midnightblue" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"> Hey guys. I usually dont like to talk about failed raids like this as I think it's sometimes percieved as a name calling or blaming session. I am going to go over what went wrong last night from what I saw and I cant say enough, that this is NOT a session of blame or bashing. Hell, for what I'm about to say I dont know who did what. These are just personal observations as to why we failed on the initial break and the secondary break.</P><P>Break one: We followed my standard procedure, of going in One group every 20 seconds to control lag and possible aggro if possible. First group inserted without incedent as did the second group. Our first mob was a Rilla that made its way towards us. We initiated combat normal. Only problem was, our cleric went LD immediatly. This was a bad hit as we were the main tank group. I compensated for this by calling out Heals in the raidchannel for person by name. We started getting now the initial break mobs. Roughly 6 of them. Scarelings, Rillas, Spiders. I was actually calling adds and Mezes and I noticed Mornica our chanter was 3 bubbles down on health with no Healer in our group. I called a Heal for mornica and went back to fighting. While killing that mob, I noted Karli going down off to the side and checked to see that Mornica was healed. She wasnt. I called it again but it didnt happen. That was mistake number one. Now I dont know what status was in any other group, but When we have 2 chanters, ONE has to stay alive when you are in Fear!! If I call out a Heal and a specific name I have a darn good reason. Stop what you are doing and find that person for a heal!! With Mornica down, and CH LD.. group one was boned as was everyone else.. Too many mobs to control without a high level WARRIOR. Something we lacked last night. However we could have done ok if the break had happened. With no CC it was only a matter of time before we wiped.. I knew this but there was nothing we could do about it. Best we could hope for was to finish as many mobs as possible to allow for the next attempt. Only other thing I did notice is you must be carefull when getting phased! The Scarelings will sometimes send you on a mini teleport tour. Usually you can see the spot you were just in and make your way back to it. If this happens, BEFORE you go back, look around you. You may have just aggroed new mobs.. if you have.. Stay there and die and ANNOUNCE it as well. Otherwise you overwhelm the party!! I didnt see this happen last night but I know it did at least twice.</P><P>Ok so we were now wiped.. I made my way back to the portal and went in alone to pull corpses. We started trying to rez in but the safe spot is not really safe and as a result, we failed. This was my mistake. We have tried it before and it does not work. Break must be complete before you can try to rez in. I will not attempt this again as it wastes time.</P><P>Next up we all met at the portal. I told you to bring CR gear if you had it. If not, we were going to zone in, loot what you could and attempt to rebreak. This I believe could have worked. I didnt see what happened tho. As I zoned in I was aggroed and Phased past the portal hill. I had 3 mobs on me.. ALL OF THEM were break mobs so I saw this as an oppurtunity to help the group and started a train of mobs a ways away from the portal hill. IN theory, the longer they chased me, the longer the group would not have to worry about the mobs. I kited a train of something like 15 mobs ( Wish I had screenshots ) away from the party hill, well out of aggro range. I barked orders to the group. Who to main assist, I told paithon to take over as well as he is LOA's other raid leader. It was my hopes that this would take enough pressure off of the group to finish the break. I could go no where near tho to see what was happening as I didnt want these mobs in the safe spot. Unfortunatly I finally got dispelled and no more sow! I chugged on as long as I could and died. We failed on that one as well. I'm not exactly sure how but I hear it was the phasing/training thing. In any case, we botched it.</P><P>Finally I took another route. I put together a 6 man crack team. IE a high level, balanced powergroup to try and finish off the remaining break mobs. For all our misses last night, the good news was there were only about 6 mobs left on initial break and we dispatched them easily. We also had the help of KOE again who saved our asses, again. I owe those guys more beer than I'd like to know about!!!! Mostly their help this time was in the form of a rez stick, but it was nice having a watchfull eye as well!!</P><P><BR>Long and the short:<BR>Sometimes raids arent as easy as we make Kael or Hate look. This comes from lots of practice in those zones and from understanding from all those involved. Its easy to make a mistake and damn, I've made a buttload of them. I'm posting this to remind those along of what tactics keep us alive and thriving!<BR><b><ul><li>Enchanters MUST be kept alive at all costs</li><BR><li>Heals called in Raid channel must be given top priority</li><BR><li>If you are phased, displaced, or somehow moved to somewhere else in raid, DONT RETURN UNLESS YOU ARE SURE YOU ARE ALONE!!</li><BR><li>Do not ASSIST the main tank until it is Called out to assist</li><BR></ul></b></P><P>OK thru that last one in there as a reminder. Wasnt a problem last night but had to be reminded anyway as it controls mob aggro with is hella important to most raids.</P><P>Finally, we will try Fear again soon. I KNOW we can handle this zone pretty easily and I dont accept failure well so now we may have to try and kill Cazic to make me feel better!!!!</P><P><img src="http://www.lostorder.com/loatales/Zlater/zsig.gif" border=0><BR><b><i>Zlater ShadowProwler<BR>BlackGuard of the <font color=red>59th</font id=red> Circle<BR>Lost Order of Akalabeth<BR>Lord of War<BR></b></i></P><P><BR>Edited by - Zlater on 05/08/2002  10:00:49</font></td>

        <font color="midnightblue" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"> Some observations from one of the clerics...<BR> <BR>On the first try, I am going to take partial blame for the wipeout and apologize for it. I saw in the raid channel Zlater tell HM to get up from FD and fight, so I tossed a heal at him since he was so low on health. Shortly after this we had a bunch of mobs come in. May have been coincidence but may not have been, there were alot of mobs there already. I think scareling ports were pulling aggro too but hard to tell. I don't know about any other clerics but I had a hard time targeting Mornica in that fight. Between being hit, ported, etc... kept getting the message about unknown target when I hit my hot key for targeting the enchanter. I usually hot key enchanters and main tanks for quick heal assists. Will work on watching raid channel closer to make sure I get that heal off in time. I know watching my groups health I sometimes miss things in the chat channels.</P><P>Second try, I think you covered it fairly well, just didn't work.</P><P>Third try. I will admit I got a bit aggravated so I brought my 56 warrior over and dual boxed hoping to help out more with the mobs. Pretty much sicced baro on whatever main assist was fighting and focused on healing till I ran out of mana. Once I was out of mana, I went down fairly fast. I am pretty sure it was scareling ports that got us this time. I know Grendahl was ported several times, I checked for additional mobs and didn't see any but it looked like ppl were getting bounced all over.</P><P>Overall I think watching out for adds if scarelings port you was the one big factor that afftected the raid. We were close to completing break twice then had a lot of mobs show up. We'll do better next time and I for one am looking for some serious payback on the denizens of fear.</P><P>Graesyn/Barodahn/Grendahl<BR>Swords of the Clan<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="midnightblue" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"> When dragging mobs around and not dotting them or attempting to kill them, it's called Jogging. Not to be confused with Kiting. Hehe. The druids will be up in arms, if they hear about a rogue kiting.<BR>A common use of Jogging is when casters will purposesly over agro most of the mobs with an AE or mass stun, and then run in big circles. This is a primative form of CC, but mostly a manaless way to do it. Jogging mobs is really only safe when in big wide open areas with little chance to add mobs.<BR>Ask me sometime about my little chanter running circles in Mistmoore for 10 minutes, cheapest CC I ever did. <img src=icon_smile_big.gif border=0 align=middle></P><P>Ok, enough about somantics. </P><P>Phase/Training is one of the biggest problems with FEAR. A lot of write ups on FEAR, <b>always</b> recommend standing and dying if phased. Since the chances are always high that you will be agro'd by additional mobs, and train them back to camp. Another thing to watch out for is the scarelings phasing someone and then running after the phased person to continue attacking. This can drag your whole group out into the wilds and create a mess. Best to let that phased person die, and hope the scareling comes back alone. Or have an agro popping class (SK,Pally) pop agro back before the scarling has time to run.<BR>LinkDeath during raids sucks. And, there really is no good way to plan or compensate for a critical player going LD. Losing a cleric during break had to be rough. I know with our records for attendance, that we are lucky to get 1 cleric per group. So, we never can really afford to lose one.<BR>I would like to emphasize the use of raid channels for communication during raids. We may need to show people how to filter battle spam better, so that important messages get proper attention. Maybe a write up on message filtering for raids and a good setup for using /hitmodes. Maybe someone could also post how to change the in-game colors of the channels text, so it is easier to notice and read. Good communication is key to any successful raid.<BR>It's good that you have found lessons to learn from this failed raid. We can be better prepared and educated for the next one. I'm sorry to hear it went so bad for you. I wish I could have been there, maybe my sword would have made a difference.</P><P><TABLE BORDER><TR><TH><IMG SRC="http://www.bicklein.com/shancy2.jpg" ALT="Shancy"><BR><TH WIDTH=200 BGCOLOR="#ad9410"><br /><FONT FACE="Monotype Corsiva" SIZE="7" COLOR=black><b>Shancy</FONT><BR><br /><FONT SIZE="1">Lost Order of Akalabeth</b></FONT></TABLE><a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

        <font color="midnightblue" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"> Damn.</P><P>I wish someone had said something to me last night, as I got on late (10:30 PM EDT) due to RL help needed by my family, as one of the CRs was happening.  I logged in, stayed on for ten minutes, and logged.  I feel bad because I probably could have made a difference in your breaking in.</P><P>Everyone should learn Zlater's rules posted and know then by heart.</P><P>One thing that irritates me is the attack before assist called thing.  I have been the MT in Hate the past three raids up there.  I can't count the number of times I've seen people attacking the target mob before I have gained sufficient aggro.  I've also been in groups where people agonize over "not being on the KS team," and aggressively attack way before the call.  Hell, I've even heard one player justify attacking before the assist is called because they "needed to build up their Defense rating."</P><P>Gonna tell you what.  We don't say not to attack until called for a reason.  Typically in the Planes or on high level raids we encounter multiple mob situations, where the MT selects a target and Enchanters or Bards mezz the adds.  When I sit there taunting three times, stunning and then attacking for ten seconds, I'm not trying to KS the freaking mob.  I'm trying to gain aggro so we can prevent "ping pong" aggro or an angry mob stuck on a mezzer.</P><P>And, NO ATTACKING means no backstabbing, no casting, no AoEs, no stuns, no hand to hand.  It means STAND THERE.</P><P>In case you didn't know, the pull team is almost NEVER "Team KS."  In fact, without exception, every time I've been on the pull team I've LOST about a half a blue bub of xp.  Funny thing is, I really enjoy being the MT!  It's more exciting than any other spot on the raid (except puller) and makes the xp loss and death induced downtime a bit more tolerable, because there's a feeling of doing something that matters.</P><P>Bottom line -- I really want to see people get past the idea of trying to KS and struggling to get xp on Planar and multi group raids.  We NEED to focus on group tactics in those situations.  That includes paying attention, listening to and following the instructions of all raid leaders (including the overall Raid Leader, Group Leaders and the Pull Team).</P><P><BR><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78807" target="_blank">Tenuvil Bravesteel</a></b><BR>56th level Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Lord of Events - LOA-EQ<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

Why you ask?  because this is the group that can take charge when sh!t hits the fan, they will survive the longest and will most likely make it thru any fight due to experience and levels.  You will have more success with 6 lvl 60s in one group than you will with those same 6 spread out in 3 or 4 groups.  And if you think that the group of 6 60's will get every kill, your probably wrong.  A group with multiple rogues, rangers or wizzys is going to take any kill they want.</P><P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=67313">Tinkalot Ereptor</a><BR>Assassin<BR>"The DPS of a Dead Rogue = 0" -- Unknown<a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>

The bard might have to switch between selo and an AE dmg song to keep them after him or her but it might be a tactic worth a try.<BR>I'm open for suggestions on the whole ordeal because there has to be something we are missing.</P><P><a href="#top"><img src="icon_go_up.gif" height=15 width=15 border="0" align="right" alt="Go to Top of Page"></a></font></td>
