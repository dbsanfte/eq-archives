		Journal of a Scholar<br />
by Friar William<br />
<br />
<br />
     As I slowly opened my eyes my head felt like a whole tribe of Orcs just slammed it with their war axes. What is this place? Where am I? As much as I tried I couldn't recall how I arrived at this mildly lit room. I could see a young person standing behind a bar of what appeared to be a tavern. The only customer didn't appear to say much. In fact the flickering light of the torches and the rather quiet room frightened me abit. Why was I here? Libraries, museums, castle halls, observatories that's where I tend to spend my last years of my life, not at these drinking establishments where the young lads gather to drink, tell stories and flatter the women. Oh my poor head! <br />
<br />
     I was still struggling to find out where I was and even to stand up straight as the barkeep approached me. A young lad he seemed to lack the ability or will to hide his intentions. He began a barrage of questions: what was I doing here? Am I aware some persons are looking for me? What is my research about? Am I aware I'm in danger? In my long years as a scholar I knew better than to answer all these direct question to such a fickle man as a barkeeper. I answered some questions vaguely and concealed my current research to the best of my ability. <br />
<br />
     When the young lad became abit too nosy in my affairs I cried I knew nothing of this business and stumbled out of the tavern into the cold Britannian night. My weary ol' legs couldn't carry me far though, and I entered the first building I saw. The lad followed me inside and seemed to realize his blunt ways of questioning would not work. He began explaining where I was, Fogwood Village. Hmmm, now that rang a bell, NOW I remember, I came to seek out the Fogwood Library! The lad offered to show it to me and somewhat hesitantly I accepted his offer. <br />
<br />
     Ah, smell that lovely scent of old wood, worn down paper and dried up ink! This was surely a welcome change to the grim looking tavern and the cold outside air. Instinctively my ol' fingers began filtering through some books at a writing desk. What!?!? Look! All those books, all those containers of humane and arcane knowledge were locked up behind a counter! Clearly upset I asked the barkeeper where the Librarian was; I needed to access these books as soon as possible! I could hardly believe when the lad said the Librarian left the Library. He told me to come back another time, apparently 'some' persons could help me reach the other books. <br />
<br />
     He asked if he could help, if there was any particular book I was looking for. By this time I began to trust this bold young lad, I whispered 'The Tome of Making', and I immediately looked around to scout for hidden ears. Apparently that seemed to strike him, as he turned visibly pale. After a few moments he regained his boldness and said he would seek for this book. By this time I was very tired of the recent events, perhaps I should have run those few yards out of the tavern. I asked what direction the Empath Abbey was as I was in need of some rest. He kindly sent me in the right direction and in a few minutes the glooming lights of the Village disappeared and the darkness engulfed me.<br />
<br />
<br />
      I felt better after a good nights sleep at the abbey and I decided I would take a walk in the vast woods of Yew. The mourning dew covered the forest with a satin layer as most creatures began to appear. This peaceful scenery turned grim with the blink of an eye as I noticed I was being followed. After turning back and confronting this mysterious person it appeared he was Lieutenant Sunwolf of the Yew Militia. He was very cordial and helpful and even volunteered to escort me to the Yew University when he learned I was searching for a certain book. I gladly accepted and we were on our way. The good Lieutenant led on through seemingly endless paths and clearings, always keeping a watchful eye at the surroundings. Apparently I was talking to a high-ranking officer of this Militia since he already heard about my research and myself...blasted barkeep must have said something to a customer. <br />
<br />
     After a long journey we arrived at the Yew University. The first stop, the main structure, had some bookshelves with some minor interesting books. For weeks now I've been deadlocked in my research and still no light at the end of the tunnel. Noticing my first disappointment he led the way to the Mage's resort and scriptorium of the University. Again there was nothing of any interest until I noticed a strange whirlpool of sparkles behind a counter. I took my looking glasses for a better look and by the Gods I swear it were micro rifts caught in a perpetual vortex. The Rifts were raw and chaotic, but with the proper knowledge this could prove a vital piece of information for my research. <br />
<br />
     By this time a small group of adventurers were upon me, all questioning me with little tact and no respect for my old age. To tell you the truth I felt abit at unease with this crowd around me and I think I gave them more information then they deserved. I told them I knew the Tome of Making was last known to belong to a wizard residing on Fire Island. And I surely shouldn't have said that very wizard was last seen around Wrong. Ah well, at least I didn't reveal that the wizard was researching ways to reach immortality through rebirth after death. Some weird pact with sinister evil forces. <br />
<br />
     At this moment there was some excitement, a man named Smogg Azalin stood outside. Being a good scholar I had heard of Smogg before, a most potent scholar himself, were it not for the fact he turned to the Dark Side. After that things moved fast, some brave men went outside to confront Smogg and distract him as I slipped out the shack and to the best of my ability ran through the woods... <br />
<br />
     After that the world turned black.... oh my poor fragile body... must rest.... must stop...<br />
<br />
     After awaking underneath a bush I decided it was time for me to seek out this wizard's study. After finding the micro rifts I know I needed little more then the Tome of Making in order for me to reproduce a Rift. I cleansed my robe of some dirt and followed a narrow path. <br />
<br />
     After a few hours of a fatiguing walk I spotted a clearing in the woods. Much to my surprise some people seemed to have constructed a Village in the middle of the woods. I even spotted a small fountain, and I kneeled down beside it for a drink of crystal clear water. I think I hadn't sat down for more than a minute or two before a villager started a conversation. I asked him whether or not they had a Library in this fine city, which they apparently didn't have. While I said to myself no respectful village doesn't have a library the young lad asked me what book I was searching for. Mentioning the Tome of Making certainly seemed to arouse his interest and before I knew it an entire group of villagers was listening at my tale. <br />
<br />
     I explained them about the Evil Wizard that was supposedly the last owner of the Tome. I told them he had a study somewhere on Fire Island, a study with a large pentagram inside. Of course I read about his study in the records of my mentor's library so I knew it was deep within the bowels of Hythloth. At the time I didn't reveal I already read one record of the Wizards life, I'm still somewhat cautious on revealing too much information. And I was right not to trust every man as a sinister looking character named Victen Demacles appeared. These villagers didn't seem very fond of him and he didn't make much attempt to make himself admirable. When someone asked him to leave, without warning, he lunged at me with a sharp katana. Before the shocked villagers realized what was going on his swords ripped a large wound in my chest. Being a fragile old man I immediately fell to the floor and the world turned black before my eyes. I woke up amidst a group of villagers all concentrating their healing powers on my battered body. Apparently they scared off the attacker and managed to save me from the clutches of death. I still felt weak and defenseless but we all agreed we couldn't wait any longer, so we decided we'd head off to Fire Island. <br />
<br />
After a very small journey we arrived at the shores of Fire Island. I shrugged off the fear and lit an old lantern as the brave soldiers of the Akalabethian Order led us into the Dark Castle. It didn't take long before the hallways were filled with steel clinging into steel, desperate battle cries and words of magic. Seemingly hordes of Orcs lunged at us with little regard to their own life. The more we progressed the more opposition we seemed to face. After hours of battle and countless precarious situations we arrived at a large room with demonic symbols and a large pentagram drawn in human blood. The party paused for a second as I kneeled down to examine the pentagram. After that everything happened fast, seemingly out of nowhere a large winged demon appeared out of thin air, striking at it's nearest target with his humongous sword. "May the Virtues protect us!! It's the Collector of Souls !!", someone cried out. The party spat apart, warriors and mages alike running in every direction. I myself found a small crate I could hide behind and watch as the brave adventurers regained their faith and rushed forward to attack this evil fiend. After a long and damaging battle the beast was finally slain, but much force was lost in this fight. Nevertheless we pressed on and behold in the backroom we spotted something that appeared to be a study. As we entered the room another winged demon appeared and attacked us without warning. No longer afraid of it's appearance the men and women slew this beast notably faster then the first one. I began a search of the room for clues. <br />
<br />
     After a few minutes of searching I uncovered a small tattered book entitled 'journal'. I flipped a few pages and cried out to my friends: This is it!! This is what we need! It's the Wizard's journal!!! Quickly my friends let us head off to safety so I can examine this! Not willing to risk the dangerous long path back out the dungeon Atlantia opened a magical gate and a few minutes later we found ourselves in the sanctuary of the LOA Village again...<br />
<br />
     As our party sat down in the Tavern of the Village I began paging through the Wizards journal. It held some very interesting information. Foremost it explained the presence of the two fierce demons around his study. Apparently they are residues of the Evil Wizard. It would appear that wherever he had a strong emotional event a ghostly imprint of his soul would remain, plaguing those who would follow his footsteps. Surely a fact we'll have to take into consideration in the future. I already knew he was seeking immortality and he hoped the Tome would deliver it, but his last entry revealed he was heading to a place he called the Warriors Graveyard. He apparently feared the clan of Ettins that lived nearby and wanted to make a pact with them in order for him to study the corpses there in peace. Many villagers frowned upon the Warrior Graveyard and couldn't think of such a place, but I had read about such a desolate site and was determined to trace the Wizards footsteps. <br />
<br />
     But the long and hard journey to Hythloth completely fatigued me so we decided it was best to rest before we pushed on. We agreed upon a time to meet and I started to make my way out of the tavern as a young lad stopped me. He asked if he could talk to me in private. I agreed and followed him outside. My dear friend Atlantia and a fellow Akalabethian followed us, as they seemed to distrust this fellow. A magical gateway opened up and we all went through. I took a brief look at the surroundings and concluded we were in the middle of a rather bad smelling swamp. Right in front of us there was a dark looking Tower. Cult of Infernal Necromancy, the tattered sign said.... not very promising. I feared of what was lurking inside but followed the man inside nonetheless.<br />
<br />
     A most sinister tower it was indeed, with skulls and bones everywhere. Nay, I cannae say I felt at ease. The lad led me through several passageways when all of a sudden a dark figure appeared in front of me. He raised his hands and a hidden trapdoor closed behind me. He grinned rather sinister and welcomed me to his keep. He tossed the lad a few coins and barked he was no longer needed. He quickly gathered the coins and disappeared through a hallway. A guard stepped out of the shadows and the dark looking character who was apparently called Smogg Azalin told me to follow me into what looked to be a meeting room. He made it very clear I wasn't going to leave before I answered all his questions. <br />
<br />
     First looking anxiously for a way out I calmed down and decided it was time to shuffle the cards on this Azalin character. I said I would tell him all I knew, if he agreed on MY rules. I would reveal him a first part of my knowledge right there and then and I would reveal the second part when I was safely released at the doors of the Empathy Abbey. He was outraged, even threw a book at me threatening to tear me limb from limb if I didn't tell him what he wanted to know immediately. But he quickly realized I was willing to take my knowledge to the grave if it should be necessary, so he agreed. I told bits and pieces of what I knew before our trip to Hythloth leaving out some details, as I didn't think I should aid him too much. Now it's time to head of to the Empathy Abbey I notified Smogg. Abit reluctant and cursing he opened up a gateway to the abbey. I quickly slipped in and found myself in a backroom of the abbey. Azalin's guards protected the door as he himself walked towards me demanding the second part. I began to stumble something about a Graveyard somewhere when all of a sudden the door was flung open. With much display of force Atlantia and her friends stormed through the doorway, clearly frightening the guards. Azalin cried out, you promised!! I had your word!!! I took one glance on Atlantia, glanced on the dark Cultists and calmly said that a word given under the threat of force isn't a true word and followed the Akalabethian warriors to safety. <br />

     By now I was completely drained of force, as my old bones were ready to collapse. The brave warriors led me to the Fogwood Village nearby and I searched for a secure resting place.... many events filled this day, if I should continue I would need a good nights rest. I prayed my new friends a safe way home and dozed off for a very long sleep.<br />
<br />
     I stretched my weary legs as I tried to climb out of the hard bunk in the Yew Militia Outpost. Although it could hardly be called a comfortable bed I felt rested and able for another journey. I stepped outside the Outpost still contemplating about my recent discoveries. A cute little hind greeted me gently as I strolled towards the Serpents Cross Tavern. Hmmm let's see... can I find a clear path in my discoveries. I was already sure that finding the resting grounds of that Wizard last known to posses the Tome of Making would be vital to my research. Due to the help of many brave warriors of the Lost Order of Akalabeth we managed to find the main study of the Wizard deep within the damned hallways of Hythloth. The very fact that demonlike reflections of this Wizard were left behind there to protect his quarters led me to believe that wherever this Wizard had resided he left behind these ghostly fiends to guard his dens. The journal recovered from his study was abit chaotic though. <br />
<br />
     The journal did indeed tell us he was in the possession of the Tome of Making, yet to complete his own research in the netherworlds he said he needed to visit 'The Warriors Graveyard'. Quite a strange name for graveyard and due to the fact I do not leave comfort of libraries to often I could not recall such a place. Perhaps his last entry would shed some light on the matter: "Damned! I was conducting my research in the Crypts where the warriors lay today when I was attacked by a foolish band of Ettins. These mindless creatures know not the importance of my work. I quickly disposed of what seemed to be a scouting force. I managed to find one of these large lugs of flesh that was barely alive after I set their ignorant heads on fire. He mumbled some native words explaining I was stealing their victims and that the Big Lord was upset. Lacking the sympathy to put him out of his misery I left him there to receive a painful death. Tomorrow I shall go again, I need to finish this work or all is lost! It wont be easy though mindless creatures these are, but numerous and primal power is their strength. We shall see if they will listen to reason, or if they will fall to my wrath!"<br />

     I was still going over the Wizards journal when I entered the Serpent's Cross Tavern. Hmmm my Akalabethian friends don't seem to be here... quite strange. I glanced on the adventurers present: Sunwolf, Hood Silverhand, Amalek, Rictar, Fizban, Will Ghostal, Windlord, Lord Rainbow King and Rabulkian. We all sat down and pondered on the whereabouts of the Graveyard when Windlord, esteemed nobleman from Eldanor proposed the underground lair of Wrong. There is a small graveyard at the entrance where the Trolls and Ettins who dwell within display their victims. Realizing this must be the aforementioned graveyard we embarked for Wrong. <br />
<br />
     The brave adventurers led the way into the Crypts at the entrance to the Ettin Realm. Seemingly everything in the Crypt cried out to us to stay away and heed their warning of death should we proceed. And indeed no sooner had we entered this foul reeking cavern or a group of Lizardmen where upon us. Realizing this was only a warmup for what lay ahead, we quickly disposed of them and pressed on deeper inside. Carefully we proceeded through hallway after hallway when we entered a large room. Nothing could have prepared us for that sight. There was an Ogre Lord in the back surrounded by an astonishing large group of Ettins and even a small band of human mercenaries. The warriors instinctively took up a protective position around myself and awaited the inevitable. They formed a small circle with myself in the inside and braced themselves as wave after wave of Ettin flung onto their ranks. The sight was horrific, as blood gushed everywhere. An Ettin's strength is legendary and they proved worthy of that reputation. <br />
<br />
     Barely the brave adventures could ward off the first wave of monsters as a second wave approached, supported by a group of vile mercenaries. Many a warrior nearly sank to the floor under so much violence but the Virtues where on our side. The force of the attack seemed to fade away as the Ogre Lord himself stormed forward. His mighty arms gripped Rictar firmly and flung him unconscious against the wall. The large beast seemed to have some interest in me and raised his mighty fist to slay me when Windlord threw himself before the strike. Windlord lay motionless on the floor but the battle was fought. The other quickly disposed of the beast with a combined effort of steel and magic.<br />
<br />
     After Rictar and Windlord were back on their feet I knelt down next to the dead Ogre Lord. I searched his sluggish body and found a scrap of paper with some strange markings on it. The message was unclear since I couldn't decipher it but I could recognize the picture of one of the Wizards demons on it. I told the tired warriors this piece of paper would surely tell us where the Wizard could be found. Some warriors wanted to press on, but then again others desperately needed to tend their wounds. So I proposed we took some rest first, which would enable me to study this document abit further. I told my friends to keep an eye on the Serpent's Cross Tavern. There's a small board out front where messages can be left, I told them I would leave a message there when we would continue onto the final lap of our long journey. After a small word of thanks the warriors departed and I returned back to Yew Militia Outpost for a secure resting place. I almost grew to like the ol' bunk in there...
