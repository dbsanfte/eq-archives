		<b>Captain's Log for the Sea Scarab - Enosh Flam, Captain<br />
Prolog:</b><br />
"Looks like we're in fer another blow" Enosh said to himself as he steered his ship, and its heavy cargo of mandrake root around the southern tip of Ice Island.  The skies had turned a dark ominous black and with wind and waves lashed at the sides of the Sea Scarab as Enosh fought with the tiller.<br />
<br />
Enosh had spent that last three months wandering the seas of Sosaria, fighting the cold, the wet and the occasional sea monster.  He wasn't quite sure what he was searching for, but he knew he'd find it when the time came. <br />
<br />
It was a warm sunny day in Skara Brea when Enosh had set sail.  The bar maids had been unusually friendly, and the harbormaster unusually sober. Still that was almost three months ago, and since then Enosh had seen almost nothing by waves, clouds and water.<br />
<br />
Still Enosh had weathered storms before and come out on top each time.  He pointed the Sea Scarab into the heart of the storm, hoping to sail through it by dawn.<br />
<br />
Deep into the night Enosh fought the helm of his ship and fought the storm.  With each wave and each passing hour sailing closer to the heart of the storm.  As midnight approached, the Sea Scarab crested a massive 30-foot wave.  In the sky the lighting danced and crack of thunder split the sky.  Off to the starboard bow a bolt of purple lighting shot down from the sky, sending a hiss of steam into the air.<br />
<br />
"What in the h..."<br />
<br />
Enosh turned the Sea Scarab towards the purple streak dancing over the surface of the water, drawn towards it somehow.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
Enosh woke up and looked around, he was laying on a moss covered stone in the middle of a grove of trees.  Behind him was a glowing purple portal, and before him a path.<br />
<br />
"Where is creation am I?" Enosh stood up and started down the path.  Near by there was a signpost.  "This way to Holtburg"<br />
<br />
<B>Harvestgrain 23, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Don't know why I'm still writin' this bloody log; I've not the foggiest idea what happened to me ship after that blasted purple lightnin' hit it.  One minute I'm fighting a storm, the next layin' in the middle of a grove of trees.  At any rate I may as well keep this log, just in case it becomes important.<br />
<br />
When I came to I was standing just on the out skirts of a town named Holtburg.  Not a bad little town, but she's nothing compared to Skara Brea if ye ask me.  Still a nice place, open and spread out.  I sought out the local eatery and spent the last of me gold on a fine mug of stout. Some of the best I've had in a long time.  Wherever I am, they sure know a thing or two about brewin' a good drink.<br />
<br />
This place is strange though, I feel like things work different here.  It actually took me a few minutes to get me land legs back (or was it the ale workin' on me, I don't rightly know) Still, I've been usin' a bow almost as long as I've been holdin' a tiller, and it took me a good few minutes to get a bloody arrow notched in me bow again.  Looks like I'm going to have to spend some time huntin' rabbits again before I wander to far into trouble.<br />
<br />
I heard some rumors today that there's a city to the south of here where there might be some of me brothers and sisters of the Lost Order of Akalabeth.  I'll have to start there after I finish another one of these stouts.<br />
<br />
<b>Harvestgrain 24, 10 Portal Year</b><br />
<br />
This place is a little stranger than I thought.  Today I started to make me way south along the road.  I managed to "acquire" a map of the lands from a fellow customer at Fispur's Foodstuffs. Poor fellow can't 'old his ale to save his life.<br />
<br />
Along the way I ran into the local welcome party, a little group of what I later learned were called Drudges.  The first thing I thought when I saw one was, "ohmygod, all the cats I killed as a lad have come back on two legs to kill me.  An that's what they did all right, twice I found myself back in the same bloody clearin' near Holtburg, till I finally figured out which end of the arrow goes on the sting (reminder: pointy end in the other man) After a good deal of runnin' and a full quiver of arrows, I finally made it to the village of Glenden Wood.<br />
<br />
This was a much nicer  town in me humble opinion, as the ale was of an even more astounding quality.  I lingered here a while taking in the view.  This village is nestled in a tree-covered valley at the intersection of the west, north and south roads.  It has everything a well to do adventurer might want, including the tavern, two bowyers and even a mage.<br />
<br />
I tried to head south again, but found myself dodging all sorts of beasties, such as giant wasps of the like I've never seen, beasties that look a cross between a cat and a troll, and bloody land sharks!  Needless to say I'll be staying the night here before I head on to the next village in me way, er, along me path.  Tomorrow its on to Cragstone.<br />
<br />
<B>Leafcull 23, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Cragstone, I finally made it to Cragstone!  I tell ye, I thought I would never live to see anything outside of Glenden Wood.  Not to say I didn't enjoy me time there, as they have what I consider the only real ale I've had in me time here, but I'm longin' fer the smell of the salty sea air and the cool brisk sea breezes.  Mayhaps soon I shall see the great seas again, but fer now, the river and lake here in Cragstone will have to do.<br />
<br />
I learned a valuable lesson on the way here though.  First, tis a good thing I've kept myself rather fit, as I've never run so much in me life!  I tell ye that I feel about as yellow as a cowardly merchant beggin' fer his life and cargo.  The other lesson I've learned is that the beasties here are smarter than the average beastie, 'specially those bloody wasps! Darned things fling magic as if it was the venom from their stingers or something. One very nearly froze me arse in place durrin' me late night run here.<br />
<br />
I've heard some rumors here at the local tavern, about the number and variety of beasties that pray travelers on the open plains.  I'm ready to agree with them on that regard.  I should learn to be more careful, (or run faster) in the future.  I'm still holdin' out hope that the stories of "the Brotherhood of the Shard and Tome" in Rithwic are true.  More so I hope that me suspicions are right and tis really me brothers and sisters in the Lost Order that are gatherin' there.  Now I truly feel like one of the "Lost" though.  Perhaps this is similar to how the Architects felt when they left Sosaria the first time.  Perhaps I'll learn more tomorrow when I try to make the trip to Rithwic.  First however, I need an ale, a nice LARGE ale...<br />
<br />
<B>Leafcull 27, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Cragstone is a rather nice town.  I've had the chance to spend some time restin' here and getting to know the lay of the land.  Tis nice to be so near the water again.  According to what I heard tell from the drunkards in the local tavern, there used to be some rather important folk livin' on the isle in the middle of the lake.  I should like to know more, seein' as the more I learn of this land and its rather colored history the more I want to know.  I've also spent a couple days huntin' rabbits and drudges (that's what the locals call those cat lookin' like things) in the area to the south west of town.  Perhaps in a couple of day's time I'll head off fer Rithwic again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<B>Leafcull 29, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
I tell ye, if I should have never worried about the trip from Cragstone to Rithwic bein' any less interesting that the one from Glenden Wood.  I left Cragstone right about dusk and headed on the road south of town.  The buggers at the local tavern said that was the way to go so go I went.  I think they were tryin' to kill me.<br />
<br />
Not a 'alf mile out of town I happened upon a camp of drudges.  The blokes nearly turned me into cat food if it weren't fer another traveler passin' by.  Me hands still won't quite do what I tell 'em when it comes to workin' me bow.  And this sorry excuse fer a 'prentice bow I'm haulin' just isn't worth its weight in mud.  Still we dispatched that little camp and when about our ways.<br />
<br />
I should have keep up me runnin' fer Rithwic, much as I did before, but I happened across an ole abandoned far house.  Seems there was a fine young lass 'ere sellin' arrow's and the like.  She's offered me a place fer the night and who am I to turn down such and offer from a young beauty as herself.  Come to think of it, it may be a wee bit longer afore I see the fair city of Rithwic.<br />
<br />
<B>Snowreap 13, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
I've spent a good number of days here on the outskirts of town with me young filly.  T'was many a joyous day and night here in this place.  Quite peaceful I should say, the land lubbin' farmers life that is.  Quite a good piece of 'unting in the area as well.  Me hands are starting to relearn the art of usin' a bow.  Tis slow learning, and I fear it will be some time before I can match me skills before I fell out of Sosaria and into this place.  Still I have no regrets if most of the people are as friendly as Jessica's be to me.<br />
<br />
Still today I found one more angry creature of Dereth that I can out run but not out fight, that would an Angry Husband.  Seems Jesse was 'olding out some information from me fer the past week or so.  Still it wasn't the man size, nor his stream of profanity that almost made ME cringe, but t'was that bloody (well would-be bloody) ax of his that had me running.  He seemed quite intent on splitin' me head in two fer accepting such hospitality from his wife while he was a travelin'.   I suppose I can see his point in all.  In any event I managed to haul most of me sorry carcass out the door and I made a run fer it.  I'd 'ave made it too, if'in it wasn't fer those damned wasps.<br />
<br />
I knew there was somethin' funny about this place and all.  Now I've put me finger, well the charred remnant there of on the problem.  Coloring in this place is a might deceiving.  You'd thing the RED wasps' would be the ones to bar-be-q ye like a Ancient Wyrm or somethin, and the BLUE wasps' would give ye the cold shoulder so to speak (that is if ye expect wasps to have the magical power of the tooth farie, but then again wasps aren't usually 6 feet long either) Still I ran from that crazy bugger with the ax, and fell right into a hornets nest, well a wasps nest at least.  On second I'm eye to eye with a half dozen six footer's and the next I'm sitin' by the Cragstone Life stone, trying to get the brimstone and soot out of me smoldering cloths.<br />
<br />
Well I picked myself up and brushed myself off, then headed fer the local pub to try and get the buzzin' out of me ears and back in me head where it belonged.  I walked in and ordered the usual, a nice stout with mug of mead to wash it down with.  The local wench who I'm sure'd been missin' me since I left town came inquirin'. She went into a piece about how I didn't' pay me tab from the last time I was in town.  Bloody extortionist! Bah!  Still she 'ad a good piece of news fer me, seems there was an archer callin' himself Tasslehof Windrunner, lookin' fer me in town.  I'd be willing' to bet that good ol' Tass of the recon force come to find me.  I didn't think I'd been that conspicuous but then again...  The fair lady at the bar told me (and only after I paid me tab, Extortionist!) that he'd headed back towards Rithwic when he didn't find me.  Tonight I think I'll find some way to "pay up" and then tomorrow its off to Rithwic again.<br />
<br />
<B>Snowreap 14, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Whew, I need to be gettin' on the road today.  Me head's throbbin' and makin' up me tab here's nearly killed me.  Blimy!  Still Rithwic's a good day's journey away, 'opefully I'll be able to make it by nightfall.  I don't relish a night out in the open with all the beasties like them damned wasps, or those 'hungry little reed shark pups. Oy!  Here's hopping and running like Heck!<br />
<br />
<B>Snowreap 15, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Blimy, I'm exhausted.  I've been runnin' since early this mornin'.  First from the bar wench of Cragstone (where on Dereth did she get the friggin' cat o' nine tales anyway??) then from the crazed farmer, (you'd then he'd 'ave forgotten me by now) and then from just about every form of beastie I've ever seen 'ere on Dereth.  Still I'm in Rithwic, seems almost too good to be true.  From here I can almost smell the salt air of the sea cost to the east.<br />
<br />
So far, I've not found me brothers of the order, but if I'm right its only a matter of time before they make their way back to this town and I can meet up with the buggers.  In the mean time I'm goin' to try me best to rest a bit and keep me sorry carcass out of trouble, well maybe at least rest a bit.<br />
<br />
<B>Snowreap 23, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Bah its been rainin' like mad fer days now, though I can't complain since I've been hole up here in the Royal Firkin.  The ale here's a little sweeter than what I found in Glenden Wood.  Not bad, but some day soon I'm going to have to head back north fer some of their nice bitter stout.<br />
<br />
Rumor has it that the Dereth remnant of the Order traveled south, and has somewhat split up (I assume since they could do more damage that way). Mayhaps tonight I shall attempt those foul lookin' portals and see if I can head them off at Shoushi to the south.  Though if the town to town portals are anything like where yer spirit goes when its been beaten from yer body, I'm probably going to return me ale, unused, to nature.<br />
<br />
<B>Snowreap 24, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Back in Shoushi, the sun has already set on this day, but what a day its been! I suppose I should start at the beginin' eh?  Early this mornin' I found myself starin' though the rain at that glowin' purple rip in reality. The wench at the Royal Firkin said it was the Shoushi portal.  I was wonderin' if I should trust her considerin' how I stiffed her on me tab and all, but then again with how she was a hollering' and the look of the town guards as they were lookin' fer me gave me the confidence to jump through.<br />
<br />
I was right, I did end up returnin' me ale to its maker.  Years on the sea and I've never once lost me stomach, one trip through that portal though, blimy!  Still it got me as far as Shoushi, which was good enough.  I headed into town and started lookin' round the place.  Very interesting city I must say.  I've never seen its like in all my travels through Sosaria.  It has a kind of flair.  Still I wouldn't want to life 'ere, I'd miss home too much. Rithwic was at least familiar enough to avoid that.<br />
<br />
Still the locals were quite friendly and polite and all.  They told me that there was a group of men and women headin' fer Hebian-To to the southeast that might be the Lost Order.  With that information and a little sake (I could right a whole book on the joys of liquor in this place blimy!) in me gullet I took off fer Hebian-To.  The road here was a short one, only took me part of the mornin' to get the Hebian-To.  Not much in the way of beastie on the way either, which as good fer me.<br />
<br />
Now this is where things start gettin' really interesting.  I managed to find me way in to Hebian-To with little problem, and would ye know who I found takin' a nap in the town square?  Me ole mess mate Joxer the Mighty! With him was a young lass named Dora who looked like she should mop the deck with both of our sorry carcasses.  Still it was good to see some familiar faces in the crowed.<br />
<br />
Joxer, Dora and I got to talkin' and were just about set on headin' out fer some adventurin' when Tasslehof 'happened by.  I'd have never known it, but he's been 'unting me down fer quite some time.  Mayhaps if I'd just sat still I'd have caught up with the Lost quicker.  Ah well, all's well that ends in the tavern, right?  Still good ole Tass is headin' up the Dereth Faction.  Guess the High Council decided to stick it out and bring the light to Dereth since a goodly number of us were here already.  That suits me just fine though.<br />
<br />
Tasslehof had a few presents fer me though.  He presented me with a wonderful Oak Yumi, which is somethin' like the Yew bow's I used to make in Sosaria, only of a much higher quality.  I'm sure its goin' to serve me well fer many a year.  Mayhaps if I ever truly retire from the adventurer's life I can hang it over me mantel in Glenden Wood.  (As if that'll ever happen).  Also Tasslehof and Dora presented me with two trade notes worth almost two thousand Pyreals.  T'was a great day in me opinion.  With the newfound coin, and yumi, I headed off to properly equip meself fer some adventurin'<br />
<br />
Joxer and I decided to head back to Shoushi, to purchase me some studded leather armor, since the armorer there was rumored to have a pretty daughter, er I mean high quality goods.  Also rumor had it that there was an old dungeon over run with drudges and their ilk.  I don't know about you, but I 'ate them cat like things almost as much as I hate water golems.<br />
<br />
Once we got me some decent armor, Joxer and I headed fer the Shoushi Grotto. Along the way Joxer showed me how to use the magic of the portals to provide communications across the realm to others of the Lost Order.  The entrance to the Grotto was another of those damned portals.  Fortunately this was a short trip and I didn't get too woozy.  Once down in the Grotto we set about turning those cat like Drudges into cat skin rugs fer the dungeon. Those crazy things were everywhere though.<br />
<br />
We were doing well until this foul odor started to creep up from the depths of the dungeon.  The air was thick with the rank odor and Joxer and I had to run fer the exit.  I know I blacked out at least once or twice trying to crawl to the portal out.  I managed to make it out in one piece, but Joxer wasn't so lucky.  He made it out, but needed to rest a while afore he could go any further.<br />
<br />
While we rested, Kileyan (Grimm) found 'is way to Shoushi.  The three of us once again descended into the grotto dungeon and did battle with the drudges and shreths there in.  After a short while that odor started it creepin' its way back into me head, makin' the world seem slow and strange.  We managed to escape this time without much trouble.<br />
<br />
Once back on the surface we headed to Shoushi again, where we found Kelsam, Necro and Arathor waiting fer us.  With our new found fellowship we decided to head to some hunting grounds in Hebian-To.  I tell ye, it was truly wonderful to see some of me old mates again.  Been way too much water under the keel since I last hunted with the likes!<br />
<br />
Our joyous reunion was short lived however, as the same stench that had our head reeling in the Shoushi grotto started to pollute the air of this fine city.  T'was almost too much to bear!  I made a run fer the outskirts of town but couldn't make it before I blacked out.<br />
<br />
When I came too, I was not far to the east of the city.  Near by the others were gettin' their legs back under them.  I guess I wasn't the only one to pass out from the stench in the air.  Still out of town the air seemed clearer so we opted to head south to Hebian-To and hunt along the beaches there.<br />
<br />
Along the way to Hebian-To we happened across Tasslehof.  We were runnin' so fast, we almost missed him.  He joined our fellowship and we continued along to Hebian-To.  In Hebian-To we collected Dora, and set about huntin' the shores of the ocean.  It was so good to smell the salty air again, to feel the sting of the salty water and feel alive again, well alive until the shallows sharks came along that is.<br />
<br />
We headed east and south along the beach, killing several azure grommies, a water golem and a few blue wasps.  Things were going great until we that water golem decided to pop up under me feet and splatter me brains out onto the sand.  Fortunately fer me (and Kileyan) the nearest life stone was only about a half mile away.  Made fer a quick trip back to the rest of the group.  Unfortunately fer me, the water golem hit me so hard that I couldn't get me senses floating 'round in portal space.  I'm not quite sure how long it took me to get me senses and get back to the physical realm, but it was long enough fer the rest of the party to deal with me corpse and several more grommies.<br />
<br />
All in all, I think I spent almost as much time gatherin' me wits near the life stone, than killing beasties, but it was some of the most fun I've had huntin' with me mates in a long time.  Fer now I'm going to rest a wee bit here in Hebian-To, and then perhaps I shall travel north again to Rithwic, or perhaps even Glenden Wood.<br />
<br />
<B>Coldeve 27, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Time truly flies when yer havin' fun.  I've spent a good number of days in Hebian-To and Shoushi.  Not a bad area, and the 'untings fine as could be. The only thing I miss is the ale and stout.  These towns have some mighty fine liquors that the locals call sake, and they are quite nice, but there's just somethin' I miss about the good stouts to be found in the northlands. I figure its just about time fer me to head back north to Rithwic and perhaps Glenden Wood, and get me something better to drink.<br />
<br />
Today is nice enough fer the travelin' but I'd 'ate to walk all the bloody way back to Rithwic this late in the day.  Mayhaps I'll give those confounded portals another try, else I might see if I can get to the coast and find me a ship that's headin' back north.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the fair bar wench here at Three Sword Hall can give me some hints or pointers on how to get back 'ome.  They've been startin' to look at me like I should get a move on again.  Mayhaps they're thinking' I should put the moves on.  Guess I'll find out sooner than later.<br />
<br />
<B>Coldeve 28, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
I should warn the next 'undred people I meet not to mess with the ladies in Shoushi.  Their skill, combined with me lack of it at the moment quite nearly killed me last night.  Needless to say, they did want me to move on as I'd drunk most of their sake.  They certainly did not want this sailor makin' a pass at them.  So I head off towards the nearest portal I could find, nursin' a sore head, and tryin' to out run the proprietor of the Three Sword Hall so he couldn't run me though on that frog sticker he was wielding'<br />
<br />
Well it just so 'appens that luck was with me tonight.  The portal I jumped through took me all the way to Yanshi, 'most two-thirds the ways to Rithwic. Once I got me senses back I thought about findin' another portal, however the queasiness from the warned me that another portal jump would make me return all that sake, and that t'would be a crime.<br />
<br />
That said, I found the nearest lifestone, shouldered me quiver of arrows and set off to the northeast. Unfortunately, there was no road from Yanshi north to Lytelthorpe.  Bein' in the mood fer a little trail blazin' I set off anyway and made up me mind to find me own way, across the rollin' hills to Lytelthorpe.<br />
<br />
T'was a most excitin' trip, which is good, if ye like that sort of thing.  Me myself would have preferred a nice stroll through the rollin' hills.  However as luck would have it, there are all sorts of beasties everywhere in this area.  I counted mayhaps a half dozen armadillos and many more uglies along the way.<br />
<br />
I'm proud to say that me bow skills are improving slowly.  I'm quite able to take down most drudges from as far as 50 yards now.  This makes travelin' much easier.  Still I found meself runnin' more than fightin' the monsters along the path I choose fer meself.  Such is life, but I could almost smell the ale flowin' from the kegs in Lytelthorpe.<br />
<br />
Took me most of the day but I finally made it to Lytelthorpe as dusk settled in, and the evenin' rains started to fall.  The first thing I did when I spied site of the town was to find the local pub.  The quality of the Roasted Shreth was not what I was 'oping fer but it wasn't bad.  (which is like sayin' roasted blood shreth on an empty stomach isn't bad)  My fortunes were improvin' though.  Seems the fine barmaid, Selflora, was friendly type and all.  She shared much information about this town and the things around it.<br />
<br />
This town has some interesting history to it.  Seems the place is an ole Empyrean strong hold that has long been overrun with Banderlings.  Recently a Lord Aleval, who now claims Lytelthorpe Keep as his own, liberated the town.  More importantly I heard tell of an old Empyrean distillery just to the south of town.  They say the place is full of drudges and shreths, but they also say there might be some ole Empyrean vintage down there.  I will have to do a wee bit o' explorin' tomorrow to find out for meself.  Fer now I'm content to listen to the rain patter of the roof of the Roasted Shreth fer a night.  After all the bed is warm and the ale good here.<br />
<br />
<B>Wintersebb 6, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Well I figure it was about time that the rain let up some so I could go out and find the entrance to the Lytelthorpe Distillery.  Still it was a wee hard to pull meself out of bed this morning, especially seein' as there is a definite chill in the air today.  Still the call of some fine ancient vintages is a strong one.<br />
<br />
So with that I picked up a small quiver of arrows, and donned me leather armor and headed off south.  Just as the rumors I'd picked up said the entrance was just south of town in a squat stone building of ancient age.  Just out side the building there was a pack of those annoyin' drudges.  There were only a couple of them, and me oak yumi made short work of them.<br />
<br />
I then progressed into the catacombs that were once the empyrean's pride and joy. (at least I should think they were).  The entrance was nothin' but a stony cave, but a short way in is what appears was the original entrance.  Here the walls are finished and the smell of putrid ale is everywhere.  Its was almost as if I was back in one of the older taverns in the world, 'cept fer all the beasties.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness I really need to travel with a larger quiver.  There were drudges and shreths everywhere down here.  I soon found meself beating the buggers back with me bow as if it was a staff.  I managed to get out in one piece though. The real pisser is that I failed to find a drop of ale or wine down there.  Still there is much that I failed to explore while I was down there.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow I think I'll head back down there with a bigger quiver.<br />
<br />
<B>Wintersebb 17, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Today started out with rain, lots of rain.  Its almost as if all the bar maids that have gone on to their final rest were a cryin' fer me.  Once again I shouldered my quiver of arrows and made fer the depths of the abandoned distillery.  Its almost becoming a routine fer me.  I guess that's why I got a wee bit cocky today and got meself in trouble.<br />
<br />
Things were going along rather well down there.  I killed a good number of gnawer shreths and some minor drudges.  I was startin' to feel me oats and get a little bolder.  I rounded on corner, walked down a ramp to the bottom of the distillery, met up with the biggest drudge I've seen to date.<br />
<br />
Well bein' that I'd had some ale with breakfast, (and she wasn't all the fillin' er um, never ye mind that) I thought to meself, "all the others I've found I've easily turned to pin cushions, lets give this bloke a try" So I notched and arrow and let it fly.  The bugger pulled the arrow right out of 'is chest and started stabbin' me with it.<br />
<br />
I came to at the lifestone on the eastern outpost of Lytelthorpe.  Not bein' one to give up on me pyreals and ale that easily I ran back to the distillery and hunted down that bloody drudge prowler.<br />
<br />
This I repeated three times.<br />
<br />
I did finally get the bugger; with the assistance of a mage I met along the way.  The fella didn't talk much, but then again we were both a little busy with the drudges and shreths at the time.  Once that prowler was dispatched though I was able to recover me coin and beat a hasty retreat.<br />
<br />
I ran all the way back to the Roasted Shreth in Lytelthorpe, where Selfora the barkeep 'elped me bandage a few, quite painful, wounds.<br />
<br />
In good news, Selfora insists that I lay up a few days.  After all I'm one of her best customers and she'd hate to have all that stout go to waste if I should really get put down fer good.  All I have to say it thank goodness fer them blasted life stones!<br />
<br />
<br />
Also somewhere along the line I collected near 500 pyreal!  T'was most profitable, although I got handed me gizzards more than a few times.  Also I'm finding that some of me skills in fletching and archery are returning, though I think its more new skill that returned old.  Still I can kill most shreaths with a handful of arrows, which is quite an improvement.<br />
<br />
I hear tell on the rumor mill that the forces of light are gathering again in Nanto to help clear the countryside of evil.  Mayhaps I shall heed the call and head there meself, though I would need to find another of the cursed portals to take me there I fear.  Ah well, I'll safe those troubles fer another day.<br />
<br />
<B>Wintersebb 28, 10 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Today has been a very long day!  Though I must say it has also been a very profitable day fer me.<br />
<br />
I awoke this mornin' to find Selfora already hard at work downstairs in the pub.  This gave me the chance to grab all me adventurin' gear and escape out the balcony.  While I very much enjoyed allowin' her to play nursemaid to me (hello nurse) I was itchin' to head back out and scourer the lost distillery again fer those rumored vintages.<br />
<br />
You know in me time here, which is goin' on a full month now, I don't think I've seen the sun but once in me entire stay.  I truly do like this fair city, but the gods do like to rain on it I find.  Still I braved the cold winter's wind and rain and headed back to the underground distillery's entrance.<br />
<br />
Once again I found my self, drooping drudges and splitting shreths left and right.  I even made it so far as to find the confounded drudge prowler that was combing the depths.  This time I got me revenge and fed him a quiver full of arrows.  Low and behold, ye know what he was guarding?  Well I'll tell ye, it was the distillery nectar itself!  I managed to grab two bottles of the stuff and haul my sorry carcass clean away.<br />
<br />
I figure I can give one bottle to sweet Selfora, since she's got a rather exotic taste in beverages.  And the other I can keep fer meself.  Perhaps tomorrow I shall head back down there and look for more of the good stuff.<br />
<br />
<B>Morningthaw 1, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
It has been another very busy and profitable two days fer me.  Things were going very well fer me in Lytelthorpe.  I've been making a good number of raids into the lost distillery, and it was proving to be very profitable.  My skills with the bow are returning, slowly, but surely.  I would have liked to stay in town fer a few more days perhaps, but there was that little matter of Selfora.  There was something that she wasn't tellin' me, though I found out the hard way.  I managed to jump into the Rithwic portal just in time, and with a little help from the flat side of her husband's ax head.  Lucky fer me it was the flat side or there might be two of me writin' this tale.<br />
<br />
Still apart from me wounded pride, and sober demeanor, I decided to make the best of it.  After all its been a month or so already and I was sure the cur at the Skull and Flagons has forgotten about me tab already.  Well at least I would have forgotten, seems the cur behind the bar didn't.  After I brushed the dirt from the road off me face and armor, I opted to head fer the Royal Firkin again.  In me short time in Rithwic, Ricetha seemed more than friendly to an ole sailor anyway.<br />
<br />
Still after gettin' shown the door twice today I wanted to go out and turn something into a pincushion.  Ricetha told be about the ole abandoned warehouse just south of town.  I figured that was as good a place as any to bash some skulls in and relieve some tension.  She was right; the place was right up me alley.  The warehouse was full of those illegitimate sons of an alley cat, drudges.  They were everywhere.  Sharpenin' their claws on all the discarded furniture and usin' young adventurers as chew toys.<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran out of arrows not one, not twice, but three times in my adventuring today.  Trothyd Fletcher was right, if you run out of arrows ye run.  Still I managed to go back to the Royal Firkin tonight with more than a couple scars and a pair of trade notes.  T'was a great evenin' adventure.<br />
<br />
Just as I was about to settle in with Ricetha, and enjoy a nice stout, I received word that Greyhawk and managed to get pulled through the portals from Norrath.  Well I sent the messenger boy to go bring him in so I could help him get adjusted, and get him a good ale and all.  We chatted fer a bit, the decided to hit the warehouse together fer a time.<br />
<br />
About this time I suddenly felt extremely fatigued.  I'm startin' to suspect that Ricetha put something in me ale, but who knows.  I decided that I should call it a night before I got meself killed (again) in that bloody drudge hole.<br />
<br />
I hear tell that the lost order's going to be gathering again soon.  If I hear more it looks like I might be makin' another long trip 'cross the bloody island.  I just hope I don't have to jump though any more portals this week, they always make me sick...<br />
<br />
<B>Morningthaw 9, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
You know I'm startin' to wonder about this place.  You'd figure that most places, when spring arrives and the New Year starts, the weather starts getting warmer.  Today when I awoke it was probably the coldest day yet since I found myself walking the forests of Dereth.  Still I've got more immediate concerns, like how I'm going to pay me tab here at the Royal Firkin.<br />
<br />
To that end I figure I'll take a stab at the rumored Rithwic crypts.  That is if I can manage to find them.  I'd do just about anything fer a few pyreal at this point (anything that is except work fer Ricetha cleanin' mugs and washin' tables)<br />
<br />
(Later in the day)<br />
<br />
Well I didn't find those crypts though I did find meself back in Lytelthorpe again.  I searched all over the west bank of the river north of town and didn't find a bloody thing but trouble.  First I happened across a camp of drudges and moswarts. That wasn't a problem fer me and I laid them all out in a line.  Next it was that red phyntos wasps.  Again not much of a problem.<br />
<br />
Once I dispatched the red wasps, I set about tryin' to pry their wings off with out damage.  I know of a collector in Lytelthorpe that was lookin' fer a set of wings to add to her collection.  Well wouldn't you know it that as soon as I got one good pair of wings off that wasp that a squadron of blue wasps snuck up behind me.  I didn't know they were there until I felt the air around me explode in a fireball.  Now I want to know what god's sick sense of humor gave the blue wasps the fire magic in the first place.  The bloody wasp nearly roasted me alive before I knew what I was doing.  Well I did what any hardened adventure would do when roasted to within an inch of his life.<br />
<br />
I ran.<br />
<br />
Some how I managed to run far enough and fast enough that the blue wasps got bored and gave up tryin' to turn me into "salty sailor shish kabob". Needless to say, when I made it back to Rithwic proper I needed a drink!  I walked into the Royal Firkin just in time to see Ricetha talkin' to a couple of rough lookin' mercenaries.  She pointed one finger at me and said, "That's the pirate!"  Once again I did what any hardened adventure would do in such a situation. I ran, again.<br />
<br />
This time though I through a small pouch of pyreal and smacked good ole Ricetha right in the forehead before I high tailed it out of there.  Those mercs were persistent to say the least.  I managed to beat them to the Lytelthorpe portal by no more than 3 steps.  This was of course right before I remember why I left Lytelthorpe to begin with.  I really need to stop "makin' a name fer meself" in some of these towns, afore I have no place to go get me ale anymore. Still I was lucky when I made my way into Lytelthorpe, seems all by Selflora's forgotten me already.  That and the ax wieldin' brute of a husband was gone travelin' again too.  So fer the time bein' I settled down, ordered meself a good stout and watched the rainfall fer a while.  Mayhaps tomorrow I'll head out again fer some more trouble makein', er I mean adventuring.<br />
<br />
<B>Morningthaw 21, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Well its been a fairly busy and exciting two days I must say...<br />
<br />
Things were goin' pretty well fer me.  I was back in Lytelthorpe, collecting gold, and the occasional bottle of that sweet nectar from the lost distillery.  (I've become quite partial to it).  I was takin' a nice rest and enjoyin' the eve of the 20th in the Roasted Shreth after a long day hunting the distillery, when a messenger showed up.  Seems 'e had a message from me ole mess mate Joxer the Mighty.<br />
<br />
Seems the Joxer wanted to meet me in Cragstone.  There has been some talk among the leadership in the Lost Order of Akalabeth that we should make either Cragstone, or the nearby fort our home here in Dereth.  Well I figured I was one portal jump, and a day's march away, so there was no sense in sittin' on me duff guzzlin' ale.<br />
<br />
I packed me things and set off.  Me first stop was Rithwic.  This time though I opted to keep a low profile since I still had a considerable tab at the Royal Firkin.  I attuned meself to the nearest life stone and started off fer Cragstone.<br />
<br />
The last time I make this walk I remember that I wound up runnin' fer me life most of the way.  This time was a little different.  I've regained much of me ole archery skills since I last made the trip.  This time I figured I could fight all the beasties I found.  I should have known better.<br />
<br />
Not of quarter of the way to Cragstone I met up with a group of outcast monouga.  I figured I could perforate the group of them afore they go close enough to do anythin' about.  Once the stars cleared out of me eyes.  I realized they were throwin' club at me skull.  Well needless to say I started runnin' again.<br />
<br />
Once I out ran that group of monouga, I happened across a nest of red wasps. I figured, surely here is a group of beasties that I can take out at range. Well I started shootin' arrows, and lo and behold this time me aim was true and I took down all three of the buggers.  Just as a landed the last wasp, I reached fer another arrow and realized that I was out.  I was both impressed and alarmed by this little stroke of luck.  Still I pulled out a bundle of shafts and arrow heads, made up another quiver full of arrows and continued on me way.<br />
<br />
The rest of me journey went much the same way, lots of runnin' and wonderin' where on Dereth all me arrows went.  Well by some stroke of luck I managed to make it all the way to Cragstone in one piece.  I found me ole pale Joxer enjoyin' an ale at the local tavern Thorsten's Rest.  Not a bad place, but I certainly won't be puttin' it on me top ten taverns of Dereth list (mostly since the proprietor's not a pretty lady)<br />
<br />
After a wee bit o' restin' and a few mugs of stout, both Joxer and I were itchin' fer some adventuring.  I asked the barkeep if 'e knew of any good places to adventure, and he suggested that we take a gander at the isle of tears.  Seems that bloody place is infested with all sorts of beastie.  I never believed how right he was until we got there ourselves.<br />
<br />
The only want onto that isle is by usin' one of those confounded portals.  I meself would much rather swim.  Still Joxer and I girded ourselves and set off. While there we found two things out.  1. We fight very well as a team, with me bow, and his sword. 2. Do not stay in one place there.<br />
<br />
On the isle we found all forms of Monougas Shreth, and wasps.  There were also more than a few drudges and banderlings meandering' about.  Still we were cuttin' them down in order quite well till we found the green wasps nest.  I managed to pick most of them off at a distance, but one got past me arrows.  I reached back to notch one more arrow and stop that bugger's buzin' fer good when I got the feeling' that somethin' was wrong.  You guessed it, I was all out of arrows again.  Well I looked at the wasp and it looked at me and then we both looked at me empty quiver.<br />
<br />
I swear the bugger was laughin' at me.<br />
<br />
When I came two I was leanin' against the lifestone in Cragstone again. After a few moments to get me senses back in place I high tailed to back through the portal and caught up with Joxer.  Seems he'd managed to obliterate the wasp right after he hosed me down with a rank acid.  Well I gathered me things, made up a few more arrows and we resumed hunting.<br />
<br />
Did I say hunting?  I meant running.<br />
<br />
You see, no sooner did I have me another quiver of arrows, then a swarm of blue wasps buzzed up and tried to bar-b-q us.  Well we took off runnin' like the devil him self were after us, mostly because with the fire bolts those wasps were throwin' it felt like the devil was after us.<br />
<br />
We managed to avoid becoming shish kabob, only to stumble into a group of the biggest shreths I've ever seen.  Well we did what any hardened adventure would do when faced with 2-1 odds like that.<br />
<br />
We ran again.<br />
<br />
This time we didn't stop runnin' till we were jumpin' into the portal back to Cragstone.<br />
<br />
All in all it was a great adventure.  Quite invigorating' and all, But meself I'm going to rest the eve and head back to Rithwic at first light.<br />

Blimy, it hurts even to write today!  Tis a long tale the finds me recoverin' me life's energies from the bottom of this mug of ale here at the Royal Firkin.  Mayhaps I should begin at the beginning.<br />
<br />
The 24th started sunny and bright, a wee too bright fer me likin' as I was still feelin' the effects of the previous night "adventures".  Still I wanted to make the most of a glorious day in spite of the pounding in me head.  I was gettin' me energies up when a couple of familiar faces walked into the Royal Firkin.  Seems Orion Red and Joxer the Mighty had found their way to Rithwic fer me.<br />
<br />
Orion was new in the world so Joxer and I 'elp Orion get some decent armor and such.  With that done we decided to set out fer a little adventurin' (partly because I had run up another tab with the Royal Firkin and needed the gold, and partly fer the sake of adventurin')<br />
<br />
Joxer wanted to show us both some of his favorite hunting grounds in Yaraq, which meant two hops through those cursed portals.  Fortunately fer me I didn't have any breakfast that day.  It never ceases to amaze me that a hardened sailor like meself gets sick from portal travel, but then again, there's probably something with the magic in those things that doin' it to me.<br />
<br />
Well eventually we found ourselves just outside of Yaraq.  I'd never been to this part of Dereth before, and I found the contrast quite startling at first.  There's sand and such everywhere.  The weather here reminds me a bit of Nu'Jelm, though the similarities stop there.  Still its a very nice town to visit, and I should think that I'll be headin' back this way some time in the future.<br />
<br />
The three of us didn't stay long in Yaraq proper though.  Joxer had places he wanted to show us.  First we took a look at some fields where a while heard of cattle roamed free.  Seems these bulls put up quite a fight if you pick one with them.  Next we hiked along the beach, Joxer wanted to show us the old empyrean crypts along the beach.  We just took a passing look since the place is quite overrun with undead and drudges.  Next we climbed one of the mesas and found a set of festival stones.  Here we marveled at the view and dreamed of sailing our fine ships into such a beautiful harbor.<br />
<br />
We stayed here for a while, sharing our dreams and ambitions for the Lost Order and ourselves here in this new realm.  After a little while though the wanderlust started to take over again and Orion and I headed out to do a bit of hunting together.  We started with those bulls just out side of Yaraq.  This served as a warm up for what was to come.<br />
<br />
After a little while Orion decided that he'd had enough for one day and headed off fer some ale and rest.  I on the other hand wasn't quite done (mostly because I had yet to have a rude awakening at the nearest lifestone) Just as Orion was getting ready to call it a night, Joxer was gettin' ready to head out fer some hunting along the beach.  Also Montesque, our ole messmate happened to show up in the Yaraq area, and was looking fer a bit of action.<br />
<br />
Well the three of us in our fellowship set out along the beach to the west of town.  Our first encounter was with a group of armadillos.  Now these beasties didn't look too friendly to me, and as soon as we got upwind of them they decided to attack us.  Mayhaps it had something to do with those armadillo hide bracers I've got, though I'll never quite know.  We did manage to put the three of them down without too much trouble, though there were a few scares.<br />
<br />
We choose the keep going along the beach a little ways further.  Our next encounter was with a blue wasp.  Now I figured those giant bugs make a great target fer a bow.  The next thing I know I'm sitting next to the Yaraq life stone dusting the soot from me armor.  Still we once I caught back up we figured we should carry on, after all one blue wasp was a fluke right?<br />
<br />
Next we came upon a water golem.  Again I notch arrow and made "friends" with it at about 80 yards.  Somehow I think I should have started running a little sooner, but as it was I started running after an unceremonious trip to the nearest life stone.  Still we weren't daunted in the least.  Next we headed a little further inland and found a pair of grommies, well at least I found the pair of grommies.<br />
<br />
This time I did run, but it didn't much matter<br />
<br />
Again I put meself back together at the Yaraq lifestone, and pounded sand all the way back to the where I'd last left the land of the living.  This time Joxer and Montesque asked, in no uncertain terms, that I lay back a bit, and not make so many "friends" among the fauna.  This was before we found the azure grommie and water golem together.<br />
<br />
Seems the two of them were having a friendly argument before we interrupted.  Once they caught wind of us, they decided to take out their aggression on yours truly.  I think Joxer was able the get the water golems undivided attention.  I however was next on the grommie's menu.<br />
<br />
This time I made no pretence about fighting.  I jus started running.<br />
<br />
Well I was doing pretty good fer a while of avoiding that grommie's teeth and acid breath.  At one point I thought I'd lost him, so I stopped to catch me breath and bandage me wounds.  That was a mistake.<br />
<br />
So once again I started running, from the life stone in Yaraq.<br />
<br />
Once I collected the last of me things, we decided that easier hunting should be had fer a while.  We opted to clear out the crypts of all their undead evil.  First though we had to clear out the drudges guarding the entrance.  That actually proved to be an easy task until Joxer accidentally hit the wisp that was fluttering through the area.<br />
<br />
We all managed to survive that little "incident" and make it to the relative safety of the crypt.  We fought down there for most of the eve of the 24th with relatively few incidents.  Eventually even Joxer was gettin' tired so we opted to call it a day.<br />
<br />
When we got out of the crypt we found the wisp still waiting for us.  And unfortunately fer us, it remembered.<br />
<br />
Now its said that wisps are smart, but this one was a genius!  Not only did he remember the three of us, but he went to take out the weakest first.  Well that means that I ran all the way back to Yaraq with me bottom burnin' from the force of the wisp's magic.  This time however I didn't stop to heal until I was safely back at the Cerulean Cove, with a glass of ale in one hand and a heath draught in the other.<br />
<br />
I rested the night, and then high tailed it back to Aluvian territory first thing in the morning.  Three portal hops later I'm back home at the Royal Firkin.  I'm thinking of restin' a few days before I head out again.  The life stones sure beat stayin' dead, but they do take a lot out of you, especially after 4 visits in one day.<br />
<br />
<B>Solclaim 7, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
I received word today that those of the Lost Order that have found themselves in Dereth are planning on meeting in Nanto in roughly a weeks time.  To that end I figured I'd best be on my way there, since its a good long journey from Rithwic.<br />
<br />
In an effort to make the trip a little shorter I hopped the portal from Rithwic to Shoushi.  The more I travel those blasted portals, the more I'm getting used to them.  Still I'm much happier travelin' the lands on foot, after all, the journey is half the adventure, right?<br />
<br />
Still it would take the better part of a fortnight to get all the way from Rithwic to Nanto by foot.  Either that, or I'd have to forsake the relative safety of the roads fer the wild lands between cities.  So once again I found myself starring at the glowin' purple gateway to Shoushi.  This time my tab at the Royal Firkin was paid up, so I didn't have the extra "motivation" to jump through the portal.  Still somehow I found the willpower to step through that portal.<br />
<br />
I found myself just outside of shoushi again.  I must say the place looks beautiful as ye look down from on the city from one of the surrounding hills.  I sat here fer a while marveling at Shoushi, laid out below me.  My many recent trips to the nearest life stone have taught me to appreciate the world I'm livin' in if nothing else.<br />
<br />
After a time of relaxin' atop of one of the many hills around Shoushi, I decided to head into town for a visit.  I figured since I was here I could take the time to sample the sake, and other local delicacies.<br />
<br />
As I made me way into town for a night of drunken debauchery I ran across Kieran Windrunner, Tasslehof's sibling.  Seems Kieran has been practicin' both alchemy and fletching.  He handed me two quivers of arrows, fer me to test for him.  One, a large quiver of broad headed arrows should prove very useful the next time I go hunting drudges, and the second a quiver of fire arrows will be priceless if the prophets of doom are half right of the coming crisis.<br />
<br />
I was very appreciative of Kieran's efforts, and would have stayed to buy him an ale, but there was a small issue of me behavior the last time I was in shoushi that I had forgotten about.  Seems the local bar maids didn't forget though.<br />
<br />
I guess it was for the better though, since it saved me a long walk to Nanto, but I managed to stumble through the Nanto portal on me way out of town.  Also fortunately for me the citizens of Shoushi decided not to follow me though.  So for now I await me brothers and sisters of the Light in Nanto, where fortunately I am as yet unknown.<br />
<br />
<B>Solclaim 17, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Oh my achin' head!  I feel as though I've been dumped in a pit with a pack of hungry armadillos!<br />
<br />
Tonight me brothers and sisters of the Lost Order of Akalabeth met in the Southern End Tavern.  It is always good to see me friends gathering in one place to share tails of adventure and such, tis always good to share a drop of ale with them too.<br />
<br />
Talk tonight varied between who else may have found their way to Dereth, to what weapons pack the most bite.  After a time we decided to explore the remote areas to the north east of Nanto, and mayhaps make our way to Hebian-To by way of the wilderness.  To me this sounded like it had the makings for a grand adventure and with the elixir of courage coursing though me veins I was all fer a bit of action.<br />
<br />
As normally happens with such endeavors, it took some time for everyone to gather their equipment, their courage and themselves at the eastern Nanto outpost.  Once that was done we set out.  The group of us, including Joxer the Mighty, Kelsam, Sunder, Wyll Walaryn, and Orion Red, set off eastward.  Along the way we killed many shreths and other beasties with great ease.  Our group was very well balanced with several warriors, a couple mages, and a couple of archers.<br />
<br />
It didn't take us long to hack, slash, cut, stumble and bleed our way to the coast.  Now I fer one have never had any luck hunting on the beach.  Seems I always wind up catchin' me guts after getting' hit in the head by a golem of some sort, or being liquidated by some azure gromie.   Well this time was no different.<br />
<br />
We were actually doing very well fer a time.  Several grommies, golems and other nasties fell before our swords, spells, and arrows.  Still when a pair of golems decided to team up, it was trouble.  I ran as I usually do, but this time I couldn't run fast enough.  The mud golem managed to catch me from behind, hammering the back of me skull such to send me flying forward...<br />
<br />
...and into a tree next to the Nanto life stone.  Still I was undaunted, I've met untimely demise on the beaches before, and I wasn't going to let one Mud golem stop me.  I got me bearing and headed off to catch up with me maties.<br />
<br />
I don't remember too much of what happened next.  It was all a blur of pain and fire.  I figure somewhere along the way to the beach I must have found something really bad because of the char marks on me armor.  When I finally came too I was face down in a ditch on the outskirts of Hebian-To.  I hope me maties didn't meet a similar fate, but I'll have to look in on them another day.  Today I need a drink, and bad!<br />
<br />
<B>Solclaim 30, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
Its been almost a full fortnight since I last braved the wilds of Dereth, and I was still feelin' the effects of me last encounter with a mud golem when I left Hebian-To. I'd been trying to rest and recover from such an adventure when my unfailing wander lust too over.  I do enjoy good sake, but there is nothing to compare with a fine stout from an Aluvian pub.<br />
<br />
With that in mind I gathered me gear and struck out for Shoushi.  I was determined to find my way back to Aluvian territory one way or another.  Shoushi, I knew had a portal to Yanshi, which would put me within a day's walk of Lytelthorpe.<br />
<br />
Portal travel is starting to get easier to handle for me, but it still will never be like walkin' or sailin' for me.  This time when I arrived in Yanshi, I was able to hold onto the contents of my stomach, but I still needed a bit of time before I could do much of anything.  I rested leanin' again that giant boulder in the middle of the town.<br />
<br />
I guess the townsfolk think that boulder to be something important, since they were givin' me the dirtiest looks I've seen this side of a banderling ball.  This was unbelievably helpful in clearin' my head so I could set off through the wild lands between Yanshi and Lytelthorpe.  Something about angry locals always stirs that wanderlust in me legs and gives me the motivation to move on.<br />
<br />
With that I decided to move on before I caused a real stir in Yanshi.  I set off to the north, hoping to find a road or maybe just stumble onto Lytelthorpe itself.  Its always humbling to think of how hard it is fer me to navigate this world.  On the seas I was unmatched in me navigation skills (when sober) but here the land is so alien to me yet, that I have a hard time findin' me way around sometimes.<br />
<br />
Still I set off in the direction I hoped would lead me to familiar Aluvian ale.  Not too far north of town, I stumbled across one of those Sho tower in the wilds.  The place was under attack by a small clan of drudges.  Being who I am, I immediately set about perforating that pack of putrid cats and liberated the hour.<br />
<br />
One I finished off the last of those pesky kittens I checked the tower out.  Seems the drudges had already killed the occupant of the house, which saddened me greatly.   I said a few prayers fer the soul of the poor bugger that passed on, and decided to move on.<br />
<br />
The rest of my trip to Lytelthorpe was uneventful, which I don't mind all that much.  Seems though that I didn't remember that certain "friends" in Lytelthorpe might not be so happy to see me.  I wound up camping for the night at the eastern outpost.  I need to stop makin' a name fer myself one of these days.<br />
<br />
<B>Seedsow 11, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
 Well I enjoyed a very nice vacation in Lytelthorpe for the last few days.  Still I felt it was time to move on again, mostly because I've run out of gold again, and I need to do something to be able to afford me next ale.  Seems Selfora's gotten a wee bit smarter, and she won't give me an ale unless I pay her first.  Now I don't understand this, as I've always paid me tab one way or another, but I guess I'll have to live with it.<br />
<br />
Not quite sure where I wanted to go, I started walking along the eastern road out of Lytelthorpe.  I stumbled across a portal that would take me to Rithwic again.  Figurin' I had nothing to loose, I walked though the portal and back to Rithwic.  Still something in me wanderlust was not satisfied, I still felt like there were other places I should explore in search of gold, ale, and the occasional bar wench.<br />
<br />
Somehow I managed to get through the Rithwic portal without having to fight me stomach to retain me breakfast.  Feeling emboldened by this newfound tolerance of mine, I decided to immediately brave the portal to Holtburg.  This I fear was a mistake.   This time I left the contents of me stomach in portal space.  Where it landed I don't wish to guess, but I'm sure someone will be most unhappy.<br />
<br />
Still it took me a little while to clear me head enough to stand again.  Its been a while since I visited Holtburg.  I guess this town will always have a place in me heart since it was the first thing I saw when I arrived here in Dereth.  Still I couldn't bring myself to stay here very long.  I choose instead to head out for Glenden Wood, since after all they have some of the best Aluvian stout I have ever found.<br />
<br />
Well I stopped at the Taut String to pick up some arrows, and set off along the road to Glenden Wood.  The more I travel the roads of Dereth, the more I wonder why some Lord or Lady does not raise an army and make some effort at making the roads safe for merchants and vagabonds alike.  The road to Glenden Wood was only slight less dangerous than the one between Glenden Wood and Cragstone.  I know that humans could never extinguish all threats on the roads of Dereth, but blimy, we hardly try!<br />
<br />
Still somehow, after going through a full quiver of arrows, and most of me nerves I managed to fight and run my way to Glenden Wood.  Still though, I was handsomely rewarded for my efforts when I got to the Helm and Shield in Glenden Wood.  Tis very odd that I feel so at home somewhere so far away from the seas.  Though I must say I have never traveled to Eastham or Dryreach, both the only Aluvian towns on the coast, so I can't say that this place is the only calling me as home.  Still the tall trees and surrounding hills remind me so very much of me old home in Yew.<br />
<br />
Mayhaps tomorrow I shall further explore the area around Glenden Wood.  Perhaps I shall even make the trip to Cragstone for a time to see if I can catch up with my fellow guardians of the Shard and Tome.<br />
<br />
<B>Seedsow 12, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
The first thing I did this morning was to forgo my exploration of Glenden Wood for the open road to Cragstone.  Mayhaps another time I will explore the woods around Glenden Wood, but from how Wilomine at the Helm and Shield described the area around Glenden Wood, I think I would do better to hunt somewhere else until I have more confidence in my archery skills, and less need of me running talents.<br />
<br />
With that in mind I filled my quiver and filled a water skin with the rich dark stout they brew at the Helm and Shield, and I set off for Cragstone once again.  Seems to me that I wind up running laps of Aluvian territory quite often, but I don't mind that so much.  This is beautiful country if I've ever seen such.  Its almost enough to make me consider the land lubbin' ranger's life.  Still my hunger for the open sea, the salty air, and all that comes with the life of a sailor will never leave my heart.  I was born to a life on the sea, and when my soul leaves my body for good, it will be on the open seas that it happens.<br />
<br />
The trip to Cragstone was every bit as dangerous as I remember it.  There were banderlings and shreth everywhere along the roadside.  Still it was nothing I couldn't fight, or out run, so I wasn't too worried.  Along the way I met a fellow traveler, by the name of Rice Cake.  I happened upon him as he was fighting a pack of young banderlings.  With his sword and their front, and my bow at their back we made short work of the lot of them.  Since we were both traveling to Cragstone, we choose to travel together, since such is always safer than traveling alone.<br />
<br />
Our journey together was long and treacherous, but with the two of us fighting together, we managed to make it together to Cragstone.  This wasn't without setback, but I've never been one to like wasps of any color, especially the blue ones.<br />
<br />
Once in Cragstone, we wet with Baron Tasslehof Windrunner.  Seems Tasslehof was in the area scouting fer a new home for the Order on Dereth.  Tasslehof was interested in scouting out the old Fort Witshire, just to the west of Cragstone.  I offered my assistance and together we again departed.  Rice Cake had to leave out fellowship as he had urgent business elsewhere in the realm but Tasslehof and I headed out to find the fort.<br />
<br />
Tasslehof had been there before, a while before I had come to Dereth.  His review of the place was glowing to say the least.  Still I was skeptical, I wanted to see the place with me own eyes first.  I need not have waited.  We fought out way to within sight of the fort, just as the sun started to set over her ramparts.  This place is truly a place a beauty!  I can almost hear the thick walls of the fort callin' me home, much as our village did before.<br />
<br />
The down side of the fort I found out soon after.  Seems that armadillos and rats have overrun the fort proper, and drudges the dungeons below.  Still I figure with a little repair work to the main gates, and the combined efforts of the Order in combat, and we could clear out both the dungeon and the fort, to make our new home safe.<br />
<br />
Once we clear the fort and take it as our own, we could then begin to safeguard the road between Glenden Wood, and Cragstone.  We could also start to spread the light of the Shard and wisdom of the Tome throughout the realm from here.  Still it would take work to pull something like that off, but we could do it.<br />
<br />
After Tasslehof gave me a quick tour of the place, (between slaying rats and armadillos) we headed back for Cragstone.  All in all it has been an exciting day filled with danger, excitement, and joy.  For now I'll sit back here at Thorsten's Rest and enjoy a few ales, and a few tails.<br />
<br />
<B>Leafdawning 15</B><br />
<br />
I woke up on the mornin' of the 11th after a few days spent at the bottom of a barrel of ale, and figured it was time fer me to move on from Cragstone.  Well I dragged me sorry carcass out of the Thorsten's Rest and tried to shield me achin' eyes and throbbin' head from the sun.  Go figure one of the few sunny days I've seen since coming to Dereth and its a day when I've got a real banger of a headache.<br />
<br />
Still I wanted to make the most of the day and all its potential, and perhaps find the pyreal to buy me way out of this hangover.  I headed over to Scildith's Bow's and picked up a quiver of his finest arrows.  Today I figured I'd head for Rithwic, since the road east and south out of Cragstone is a little less treacherous that the road north and west.<br />
<br />
Well perhaps this wasn't such a good day fer traveling.  I was just out of sight of Cragstone when I came upon a group of young banderlings raiding one of the farms just south east of town.  Well I notched an arrow in my trusty oak yumi and took aim at the lead banderling.  I let my shaft fly, and true to its mark I struck the banderling square in the chest.  Well if there was anything that could grab a banderlings attention faster than a pile of pyreals its an arrow in the gizzard.  He started howling and screaming at the top of his lung and he and his mates started after me.  Thanks to the speed of me bow, and my returning skills I managed to drop the lead banderling after he took only 10 paces.  I hoped this would discourage his mates from picking me apart.<br />
<br />
I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Well I'm sure you can guess what happened next.  I started running.  Still in my hung over state, and with as enraged as the banderlings were, I found that I was having trouble staying in front of them.  Now we must have run around that farmhouse five times before I managed to run into someone other than a banderling.  Seems my friend Rice Cake was out fer a leisurely walk on the road from Rithwic (as if such a walk can be leisurely).  Well I ran into him, the banderlings ran into me, and Rice Cake ran through the new lead banderling.<br />
<br />
After this chance meeting, the last banderling lost his resolve and ran fer his life.  I was too busy making sure I was still in one piece to bother picking him off with my bow.  I'm starting to think that was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Rice Cake and I chatted for a little bit while I rested from my race around the farmhouse.  I was still trying to catch me breath when the owner of the house came out to thank us fer helping save him from.  The farmer came out and said "Thank ye so... why you dirty scoundrel!"  It was at this point I remember just what farm this was, and on what terms I had last left here.  Without further deliberation, I took off running again.  I might not have been able to outrun a group of banderlings today, but I managed to outrun one angry farmer.<br />
<br />
A short while later Rice Cake caught up with me.  We decided to travel together back to Rithwic since the roads are always safer in a group, and we fight fairly well together.  This proved to be a very good idea since along the way we found a large number of banderlings hunting along the road.  No doubt the one we let live at the farmhouse decided to rouse his bigger brothers.  <br />
<br />
About three quarters of the way to Rithwic we came upon a group of banderling guards and scouts.  One undersized runt of a banderling pointed his finger in our direction and let out a howl.  Now I don't know much banderling speak, but I could figure out what the whelp was sayin'.  In common it sounds something like "There they are! Get 'em!"  Well bein' in no condition to fight a group of banderlings that large I opted to run, but not before I plunked an arrow in that arrogant whelp's hide.<br />
<br />
Well I ran, and Rice Cake ran, but I didn't run fast enough.  One of the banderling guards managed to catch up to me, and when he did he took that club of his and blasted me...<br />
<br />
...back to the Cragstone life stone.  Well once I got me bearings, I set of running, hoping to catch up with Rice Cake before he too was overrun.  I ran back to the site of my untimely demise (giving the farmhouse wide berth this time).  When I got there I found Rice Cake standing in the middle of a pile of banderling corpses.  I must make a note never to piss him off, since he is obviously an expert with that tachi that he wields.<br />
<br />
Reunited we decided to waist no time in getting back to Rithwic for a long rest and a stout ale.<br />
<br />
<B>Thistledown 22, 11 Portal Year</B><br />
<br />
I like Rithwic, I really do.  The ale is good, the wenches friendly, and the shopkeepers honest.  Tis a good town, but somehow I can never seem to keep meself there very long.  Mayhaps its my lack of a steady income that does that, or mayhaps it is my wanderlust, and desire to return to the sea.  Who knows?  Still this morning I found myself debating on leaving town again and heading out.  The problem was I didn't quite know where I wanted to go.  That's when I received a message from a very scared lookin' young lass.  Seems she'd been running all night to let me know that me ole mess mate and Patron Joxer the Mighty was using Cragstone as his staging grounds fer some rabble rousing.<br />
<br />
Well not wantin' to miss out of any of the action I decided I needed to head to Cragstone myself and join in the fray.  After all I still owe Joxer a stout drink or two and all.  With that I donned my studded leather armor and headed north to Cragstone.  Now when I last made this journey I found the road clogged with banderlings and their swag.  This time all I happened across, other than the occasional young banderlings was a couple of wings of red wasps.<br />
<br />
Now I don't like banderlings one bit, and I'm not sorry to see the road cleared of them, but something in that alarms me greatly.  After all I was just hunting the buggers to the south of Rithwic not three days ago.  It worries me that they have seemingly moved south as if migrating like birds away from something.  I'm not one to scare easy by bar maid rumors and drunken' stories (after all I've told me fair share of them) but still, the rumors surrounding the cold weather we've been having and the movements of the banderling tribes has got me a mite scared.<br />
<br />
It was almost too easy to make my way north to Cragstone.  Still I didn't let that daunt me much, since after all I was planning on meeting up with my brothers and sisters from the Lost Order of Akalabeth.  Well I managed to get myself to Cragstone with little difficulty, and went about making myself at home, drinking at the Thorsten's Rest pub.  I didn't have to wait long for me matey to show up, with a thirst fer a large mug of ale.  With him was me ole matey Orion Red, Sunder, and Katana Moonblade.  Seems they'd just gotten back from an eve patrolling the roads north and west of town.<br />
<br />
We chatted for a while on all the usual matters, which towns had the best ale, where the nearest nest of those pesky drudges was, and the movements of banderlings and shreth through the area.  Talk also turned to the cold weather, and the rumors surrounding it.  Still I won't let meself get too worries until some of the really nasty beasties from the north start traveling down in the populated areas.  Then I will worry.<br />
<br />
After a little while Palehorse showed up.  Now it seems like the whole bloody Akalabeth Fleet's gotten pulled into Dereth!  Not that I'm complainin' mind ye, but I was hopin' to keep the secret of Glenden Wood's ale a little longer.<br />
<br />
As the day grew old around us we got ourselves well into the last keg of ale at the 'Rest.  Having filled ourselves on all but the very last drop of ale, Joxer Palehorse and I figured that we could do with a bit of a scrape around the area.  I'm not quite sure exactly where we went after that, since the event of the night mixed with the ale, 'ave befuddled me mind a bit.<br />
<br />
We headed out from Cragstone a short ways along the northwest road.   A short way out of town we spotted a house on top of a near by hill.  Something about that house bothered Palehorse so we hiked up the hill to take a look-see.  We found the place besieged by a troop of young banderlings.  With my bow, and Joxer and Palehorse's steel we made short work of the young would be raiders, though not before they had killed the inhabitant of the house.<br />
<br />
These are certainly dangerous time we live in.  I stopped to say a short prayer for the slain farmer before we moved on, trying to back track the banderlings and find the main body of their group.  It didn't take us long to find something, though it wasn't what we were looking for.<br />
<br />
I came to at the Cragstone lifestone, rubbing my head and wondering what in the heck had happened.  Then I remembered the shreth, and how all for of them with their 6 foot spikes had plowed me under without an effort.  I grabbed my bow and started running for the scene of my untimely trip to the lifestone and found my friends in a pitched battle with the shreth over the items and I left behind.  With bow, and steel we were able to finally beat back the hoards long enough to gather my belonging and get out of there.<br />
<br />
We still wanted to exact some revenge on the banderling tribes for the death of the farmer.  Fortunately the trail was still fresh and our detour around the shreth didn't cost us much time.  Obviously the banderlings made no effort to cover their tracks as we found their camp rather quickly.  Seems they were a large part of a small group of raiders that have been left behind by their tribe.  Fortunately for the farmers around Cragstone, this raiding party won't be bothering anyone any time soon.<br />
<br />
With a pack full of weapons collected from the banderling camp I decided to call it a day, and head back fer a bit of sleep at the 'Rest.<br />

Where did the summer go?  Seems to me that whatever gods or devils control the weather fergot that the growin' season was supposed to happen over the last few months, and we're supposed to have a nice harvest about this time of year as the days get shorter and the weather cools.  Seems to me that they forgot to warm things up.  There might be more problems on the horizon other than just the cold itself though.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, Kelsam offered Joxer the Mighty and the rest of us from the ole' Lost Fleet to help out with Arathor's rangers in scouting out the cause of the cold.  I don't 'spect to learn much, other than we're to find a good ale, but still I needed the excuse to head back north to Glenden Wood.<br />
<br />
Somethin' must be brewing because even the beasties are laying low waiting for whatever it is to hit.  I've a feeling that when it hits, its going to hit hard, and leave a permanent mark on the face of Dereth.  I took my time walking along the road to Glenden Wood, it was quite, too quite.  I found only one small group of banderlings lookin' fer food or trouble along the road.  What they found was a half quiver of arrows.<br />
<br />
While I was still a ways out of town it started raining.  Perhaps the banderlings and other beasties aren't as dumb as one would believe.  It was a bitter cold rain, and showed no sign of relenting any time soon.  I closed the distance to Glenden Wood as fast as I could, not wanting to be out in the rain any longer than need be.<br />
<br />
It was quiet in Glenden Wood as well when I arrived.  Perhaps I'll stay here a while and soak up some ale and information at the local pub.  Perhaps the evil that's behind the strange weather of late will even show itself before I move on to Holtburg.  Perhaps...<br />
<br />
<b>Harvestgrain 23, 11 Portal Year</b><br />
<br />
I've been in Dereth a full year now.  I must say, in that time I've come to find this place as home to me as the one I left.  Still I miss the salty air and warm tropic breezes that filled my sails.  Though anything would be preferable to the strange weather that's befallen the realm.  All last winter there was hardly a flake of snow of the ground.  Now we're not even past the reap and the whole place is covered with the stuff.<br />
<br />
The cold rain that started when I arrived in Glenden Wood last week never abated.  Instead it turned itself to snow.  In fact the snow's continuing to fall over the place.  I've also heard rumors of snowmen walkin' around and flinging shards of ice at travelers on the road.  I'll have to check into it fer Joxer and the Order, if I could only get over this blasted cold!<br />
<br />
<b>Leafcull 12, 11 Portal Year</b><br />
<br />
Its been a full fortnight and the cold shows no signs of abating yet.  I've done some exploring around the Glenden Wood area looking fer a cause, a rumor or at least a way I have help the locals keep warm and well fed.  In the last few weeks I've heard rumors that the snowmen we used to build as children have become animated and are attacking the unwary traveler.  Today I verified those rumors for myself.<br />
<br />
I was exploring the areas just north and west of Glenden Wood today and at the crest of a hill I found a snowman wielding a snowball.  He lobbed the thing at me, and though it didn't hurt, it was very unsettling.  I took the bugger down quite easily, but if even the snowmen are fighting humans now, I worry as to what lurks in the north wilds and in the direlands.<br />
<br />
In my explorations I did not find much else, other than snow and the occasional snowman.  Though I did find an abandoned prison just north west of town.  Though humans have abandoned the place, a colony of mites has taken up residence within.<br />
<br />
I would like to head back there some time soon with a larger force.  The mites that have taken to calling the old prison home are not featherweights like their surface dwelling brethren.  I have heard that before the place was abandoned the last human residents stashed a pile of arms and armor there.  Though the drunkard that said such could have been referring to another place in the area, it still would be worth checking into, if only to clear out a pack of mites.<br />
<br />
After I found that prison I headed east and happened upon a farmer.  The poor mate was shiverin' in the cold and had already run out of food due to the poor harvest.  Well I didn't have much in the way of food fer him, but I shared an ale and gave him a little pyreal to help him though the winter.  Must me a hard life fer the likes of him, with the weather as its been, and a camp of mites not 2 miles from 'is home.<br />
<br />
After that I decied to head back into town myself and replenish my ale supply.  While I was warmin' me blood with a mug of Glenden Wood's fine stout I over heard the bar tender talking about some expidition to the north lands that has disappeared.  Seems a Sir Joffre Tremblanitis lead a group of adventures north to find the cause of the cold spell and they disappeared.  They left from the town of Arwic, which is a good two days travel from here.  Perhaps I'll head that way if the weather permits as well as put out word to the Lost Order to meet there.  Perhaps there is something that the combined forces of the Shard and Tome can do to either find this lost party, or the cause of the strange happenin's of late.<br />
<br />
<b>Leafcull 16, 11 Portal Year</b><br />
<br />
Its been a rather uneventful day I must say, at least in terms of how things have been since I found myself here in the land of Dereth.  I started in Glenden Wood, drinkin' my favorite stout, and trying to fight off the chill in the air.  Still I was up long before sunrise and figured I should make the most of the day in spite of the cold in the air.<br />
<br />
With a few mugs of stout in me, I decided to resume my explorations around the town.  The snows had finally abated somewhat and the weather seemed at least a bit warmer so I figured it a good day to strike off to the south west of town.  My wanderings didn't take me far before I found that most of the beasties that lived in the wilds of the area were fairing no better in the cold than I was.  In my morning wanderings I only found a couple banderlings, and these took flight rather than stay to fight.  That seemed like odd behavior too me, but then again the cold is hard on everyone except those magical monstrosities, the snowmen.<br />
<br />
I'd been in Glenden Wood for a few days now so I decided that it was time to head out and find the rest of me mates in the Lost Order.  I figured my news on the lost party of Sir Joffe Tremblant was too important to hold on to for much longer even for all the ale in Glenden Wood.<br />
<br />
I figured the fastest way to find me maties was to travel to Rithwic, since we still call that town our home to some fasion.  That and the place is in the middle of most of the towns that our Order frequents, which makes it a good meeting place.  Feelin' pressed for time, and not wanting to be out in the cold any longer than necessary I decided to risk loosin' me appetite and taking the portal from Holtburg to Rithwic.<br />
<br />
Its strange, event the road to Holtburg was quite today.  Usually I can count on fighting off or running from countless shreth and banderlings, but today it was almost as if I was walking though the well hunted forests of my home in Yew.  I wonder if this isn't the calm before the real storm.  Perhaps I'm just paranoid.<br />
<br />
It only took me a couple of hours to walk to Holtburg and then hop the portal to Rithwic.  I'm actually starting to adjust to portal travel, at least a little bit.  I managed to hold up quite well this time.  Perhaps some day it will become second nature to me, but somehow I doubt that.  <br />
<br />
Tonight I'll wait in Rithwic, and hope that some the Order pass through.  If not, I'll see about sending out messengers and heading to Arwic myself.<br />
<br />
<b>Leafcull 27, 11 Portal Year</b><br />
<br />
Today the messengers I hired returned and let me know that my lord Joxer was in Cragstone and awaiting my report.  With due haste and a couple of Rithwic ales I dressed in me warmest wools and started for Cragstone.  Its always hard to leave Rithwic, more so than any other town I've been in.  It might have something to do with how friendly Ricetha at the Royal Firkin has been of late, part of it is how much the place reminds me of the towns and cities I've left behind.  But that was over a year ago now, and that part of me life is behind me.<br />
<br />
I made my way with all speed to Cragstone.  If Joxer was there, there should be others, and I did miss me friends and messmates.  Seems to me that without a village to call our own in this place its much harder for those of us in the Order to gather in one place at one time.<br />
<br />
There were more beasties along the road to Cragstone than I had found the last time I traveled the roads of the realm.  I would have liked to stay and clear some of them out, but there was no time.  Still it took me most of the day to make the long journey from Rithwic to Cragstone.  I almost found myself wishing for a portal to gate me there as I fought off the cold and the beasties along the road.<br />
<br />
I found Joxer, as expected, at the Thorsten's Rest.  With him was Orion Red, and Katana Moonblade, a friend of the order.  Joxer was already well into his ale by the time I got there.  Not wanting to be out done by me old shipmate, I ordered a round of their best and proceeded to give my report.  There we stayed fer the next few hours, drinking, tellin' tales of our travels since we last crossed paths, and drinkin' some more.  The patron of the Thorsten's Rest is a sour fellow though.  T'was nearing nightfall when the bugger threw us out on our ears.  Seems he was a bit turned out by the fact that we drank all his ale and were threatenin' to pass out on the floor of his tavern.  I thought he was quite rude, but it was a good excuse as any to head out to another pub with a little more ale.<br />
<br />
Orion Red and Katana Moonblade decided to head back to Rithwic and gather some more ale and information as could be had there.  I figured that I'd already seen enough of Rithwic (though one could never see enough of Ricetha as she's the "friendly" type).  Also Joxer had a mind to head for Glenden Wood himself.  He wanted to ask some more questions of the citizens of that town.  Also Wyll Walaryn was in the area, and we hoped to meet him there.<br />
<br />
Since Joxer was heading to Glenden Wood, and a wee bit drunk to boot, I opted to go with him.  Besides, I could let him drink up all the stout in Glenden Wood without at least a little help from me.  Well the road from Cragstone to Glenden Wood was just as interesting as it usually is.  Seems the beasties along the way are getting used to the cold.  Still we managed to make it the rest of the way with little incident and fewer arrows on the far side.<br />
<br />
Once we arrived in town, our first objective was to sample some the tavern's famous stout.  In the middle of town we found Wyll Walaryn.  Seems he was trying to meet with the main body of the Order in Dereth.  Well being that Joxer and I are proud if not intoxicated ambassadors of the Light in Dereth, we took 'im under our wing and set about the business at hand.  <br />
<br />
In the tavern, who did we find but Carfeld of Yew.  Seems more and more of the Order are getting pulled here by Asheron's cursed portals every day.  From talking with Carfeld, between mugs of stout and loud drunken songs, we learned of a near by dungeon that had been takin' a heavy toll on our mate.  Perhaps tomorrow we'll head there and check it out fer ourselves.<br />
<br />
<b>Leafcull 31, 11 Portal Year</b><br />
<br />
Blimy, that is the last time I go crawlin' around in a dungeon full of undead with a raging hang over pounding me brains from the inside out.  Its been a long three days that find me back in Rithwic.  I almost cringe at the thought of committing the full account to paper.  Perhaps its time fer a bit of a vacation fer this old seadog.  <br />
<br />
Over the last three days, I've seen more of the inside of a life stone that I ever want to see again.  It started the cold morning of the 28th.  Joxer, Carfeld, Wyll and myself all headed for the nearby prison in Glenden Wood.  We figured with a group our size, we might be able to beat back some of the forces of darkness long enough to get a good lay of the land there.  We were wrong<br />
<br />
There were far more undead and other beasties down there than we expected.  Both Carfeld and I fell on numerous occasions.  Still we pressed onward, until it was made clear to us by a few magic bolts from a particularly nasty skelly that we needed backup.  With that we broke for the surface again.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the day we licked our wounds and tried to recover some.  The next morning Wyll, Carfeld and I decided that we should head back for Cragstone, and eventually Rithwic to try and meet with some others of the order.  Eventually we figured that Arwic would be a good place to head with the rumors of the lost party there.  The trip to Rithwic took a total to two days, and almost a dozen trips to the nearest life stone for both Carfeld and I.  It was truly great to travel with me fellows in the Order, though me mind (with the help of Ricetha's ale) is already trying to forget the amount of time spent in portal space, apart from me body.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I will rest here in Rithwic fer a while I recover from the portal sickness that one seems to get when brought back to the land of the living.  At least the trip proved more or less profitable.  I should be able to afford to keep the ale commin' fer a few months on what I made, if I'm careful.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Verdantine 17, 12 Portal Year</b><br />
<br />
Well it seems that my little vacation was a little longer than I wanted.  Still who am I to pass up cheep ale, and a warm bed fer so long?  Still the signs are pointing to the fact that I need to resume my wanderings.  Mostly because my pouch of pyreal has run empty and my mug of ale has run dry.  To top it off, Ricetha is not nearly as friendly when I'm short on pyreal, as she is when I've a full purse.  Bah!<br />
<br />
With Ricetha's moaning about my tab still ringing in my ears I set out east from Rithwic.  I've never been to Eastham, or Arwic.  From what I've been hearing in the last few months, some very interesting things have happened in the Arwic area, most surrounding the cold weather that's stolen our summer from us.  I found myself wishing that I remembered just enough of the magic I learned as a boy to grant myself a little warmth for my trip.<br />
<br />
Still after a little traveling, I started to forget cold as I lost myself in the joy of exploring new places.  I've been meaning to travel this way for some time, but something always comes up that keeps me from heading north.  Some day I might start exploring the mountains north of Aluvian territory, but I hear that the beasties that call those mountains home are much more than a match fer me.<br />
<br />
The road to Eastham was quite, and short.  Reminds me a bit of the road from Shoushi to Hebian-To.  I think its been almost a Year since I was in that part of Dereth.  Perhaps that's another place I should visit again when my wanderlust gives me a taste for sake again.<br />
<br />
The moment I walked into Eastham I knew I would fall in love with this town.  There was a strong breeze from the east, bringing with it the smell of the salty sea air.  Its been nearly two years since I've set foot on the deck of a ship, and the smell of the sea and sting of its winds brought home how much I miss my beloved Sea Scarab, and even more so, me first ship the Bloodwake.  Perhaps some day I'll try to dredge up the lesions a life on the sea, and my ship buildin' father taught me about ship construction and try to build this worlds first sailin' ship. <br />
<br />
My initial opinion of Eastham was confirmed when I stepped inside the Leaping Stallion Tavern.  Byrdara was the friendly sort of barkeep that I've come to expect here is Aluvia, and the stout they served here was the best I've had outside of Glenden Wood to date!  I could have stayed on a while here, but fer the message she had fer me.  Seems my reputation preceded me, but only enough for her to relay a message from me mate Orion Red.  Seems he was in Arwic, and wanted to see me fer something.<br />
I decided not to stay long in Eastham, I can always come back after all, and I started along the road to Arwic.  This trip was a much longer one, and it took me the better part of the day to get all the way there.  The trip was not very eventful, but I did gather quite a collection of wasp wings along the way.<br />
<br />
I find that Arwic is an interesting town.  First its generally a good staging ground for those brave enough to explore the northlands.  Second since the departure and disappearance of the Tremblanitis party at the onset of the snow, many an adventurer has braved the cold and snows north of Arwic.  These two factors have made the place extremely popular.  The number of adventurers I found when I visited the city was incredible.  Still after a short walk around town I can see why they like the place so much.<br />
<br />
I found one of Orion's messages in the Twin Auroch tavern.  He was makin' a pass at Mae Lilidag when I walked in.  I figured I'd better intervene before he got 'imself in trouble.  Seems that I'd missed Orion by about a day, but this fellow had an armadillo hide coat for me.  This was an incredible improvement from the piecemeal auroch and reed shark hide studded leather I was wearing.  I will have to remember to buy Orion a whole keg of Glenden Wood's finest.<br />
<br />
I decided to walk around town, and see what kind of arms and equipment the merchants of Arwic were selling.  I didn't get far before a purplish haze descended on the city.  Now I've only ever been caught in a portal storm once before, and that was when I got pulled here from the deck of me own ship.  This storm wasn't as large but it did cast me about 2 miles out side of Arwic.<br />
<br />
Rather than take my chances with the raging portal storm in Arwic, I decided to camp out at the nearby Arwic outpost and get some sleep.<br />
