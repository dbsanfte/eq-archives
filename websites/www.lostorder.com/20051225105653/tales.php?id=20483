<h2>The Black Fortress Part 5</h2>
<div class="tale">
	<h5>By: Santiago</h5>
	<div class="text">
		A Damsel in Distress<br />
by Santiago<br />
<br />
Even the moon was in disguise tonight. Whatever her reasons (for in truth, who can say whether or not the Mistress of Madmen would ever adhere to any sort of reason), she had chosen to hide herself behind a veil of clouds. But her presence was undeniable, for those celestial vapors were lit with a soft, silvery incandescence that could only be hers.<br />
<br />
Santiago was not paying attention to the night sky; he was too busy trying to scale the garden wall without killing himself. It was about a ten-foot climb, with sharp iron spikes on top, and then a ten-foot drop on the other side. If he could manage it all with no broken bones and no one seeing him, then he would count himself a lucky bloke. <br />
<br />
And so it was that, with a loud 'oomph', a lucky bloke dropped into the garden. He took a moment to brush the dirt off his fancy clothing -- most of which was a fortunately dark color. Red Tom had thought it appropriate for Santiago to wear the costume of Montesque -- a famous swashbuckler of old who had fought against evil while concealing his identity with a simple black mask. <br />
<br />
Santiago had to admit that he liked the costume -- the long black cape, the white silk shirt, the wide-brimmed black hat with a single, scarlet feather. He imagined himself crossing swords against a dozen foes at once, but then realized that such a battle would be ridiculously short, and its conclusion would find him sliced into little itty-bitty pieces. He sighed and put aside such silly romantic notions, making sure that his own mask was intact as he began to stroll along the dirt path toward the well-lit town hall.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
As he approached an old wooden bridge, he could hear voices on the other side -- a man's and a woman's. They were speaking softly, and their conversation was inaudible -- until he heard the woman say, "Please...just leave me alone." Apparently the man did not leave her alone, for his voice continued in a subdued but unmistakably angry tone.<br />
<br />
Santiago had heard all that he needed to hear. He marched across the bridge and walked right up to the man, who was dressed in a lavish costume of red and gold. "The lady asked ye to leave her alone," said Santiago, his voice quiet but full of menace. "I'll ask the same."<br />
<br />
The man looked taken aback at the dark figure who seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, as if conjured by the night itself. "W-Who are you?"<br />
<br />
"I am Montesque!" said Santiago, with a concealed grin, twirling his cape about for dramatic effect. "I trust ye heard o' me?"<br />
<br />
"Ridiculous. Walk on...this does not concern you."<br />
<br />
"Aye, but it does! Thar's villainy about, an' I'm here to see it out the door."<br />
<br />
"Obviously you do not know who I am." The man removed his mask, revealing an angry, angular face that was punctuated by two coal-black eyes. "I am the Vitiello, the Duke of Vesper, and I think it would be best for you not to cross me."<br />
<br />
"I don't care if yer Lord British 'imself," said Santiago. "The lady asked ye to leave her alone, an' that means ye leave her alone. If ye were a gentleman, ye'd already know that. Since ye ain't..." Santiago pressed his gloves together and flexed them admonishingly. "I'll ask one more time, yer lordship, an' then I'll have to introduce that noble face o' yers to the mud on the ground here."<br />
<br />
So choked with rage was the duke that it took a moment before he was able to speak coherently. "This is not over!" he warned, pointing his finger at the insolent pirate. "And that goes for you as well, milady." With that, he turned and stormed away toward the town hall.<br />
<br />
Santiago dramatically brushed off his gloves, as if he had just gotten them dirty. Then he turned to regard the lady, and his breath caught in his throat. Even in disguise, she was beautiful. Santiago had always had a weakness for red hair, and he was feeling weak indeed right now, entranced by the dark red ringlets that fell across her bare shoulders. Her costume was elegant without being gaudy, simple without being plain. She wore a white dress that tapered tantalizingly into nearly transparent mesh here and there. Her mask was that of a cat, and almost feline were the bright blue eyes that peered at him from beneath it. To Santiago, she looked like an angel in the darkness, and he could not take his eyes away from her.<br />
<br />
"You should not have done that," said the woman. "The duke is a dangerous man."<br />
<br />
Santiago feigned nonchalance and shrugged. "Danger an' me is ol' friends, milady. 'Sides, I'm wearin' a mask, in case ye ain't noticed. No one can tell who I am."<br />
<br />
"Ah, but I know who you are."<br />
<br />
"Ye...ye do, milady?" Santiago gulped nervously.<br />
<br />
"Certainly. You're Montesque...you said so, yourself. Gallant swashbuckler, always eager to come to the aid of a damsel in distress...?"<br />
<br />
"Erm...aye, that's me, milady!"<br />
<br />
She smiled invisibly. "I thank you. It's not every day that a stranger comes to my aid."<br />
<br />
"I take it ye ain't exactly on good terms with the duke?"<br />
<br />
"That's putting it mildly. But please...I don't want to talk about it right now. Instead...may I ask a favor of you?"<br />
<br />
"Anythin' in the warld, milady. Just put a name to it."<br />
<br />
"Would you escort me back to the party?"<br />
<br />
"Milady, it would be an honor." He offered his arm to her, and she accepted it. A shudder of pleasure coursed through him at her nearness, and it was all he could do to keep from tearing his mask away and embracing her right then and there. But then he remembered who he was -- not a legendary swashbuckler, but rather a penniless rogue with hardly two coins to his name. She was a noblewoman; how could he ever hope to deserve her? No...better for the masks to remain intact.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, he was hard-pressed to remember his mission of vengeance as she led him toward the light-filled mansion. He held a lady's hand in his own, and he wanted nothing more than for the blissful illusion to continue just a little while longer...
