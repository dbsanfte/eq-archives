Some of the events may be off by a few<br>             months, or slightly out of order in a few cases, but by and large the facts here are correct. Note that the locations of Origin's offices at various<br>             times can be a clue to the nature of your collectibles in some instances, as the addresses appear on the backs of most items included with the<br>             games (such as manuals, play cards, and so on). A lot of the information, especially before 1990, can also be found in the Official Book of<br>             Ultima by Shay Addams. <p><p><p>              <br>                 1977<p>                      Richard Garriott and some friends start their own computer programming course at Clear Creek High School. Their self-directed<br>                      project is to write a fantasy computer game. <p>                 1979<p>                 Summer<p>                      Richard takes a job at the local Computerland store, where Apple II home computers are being sold. He decides to learn about the<br>                      Apple by writing programs in his spare time at the store. By the end of the summer, he has produced a game he calls Akalabeth,<br>                      written in Applesoft Basic and read into the computer off of cassette tapes. His manager suggests he make some copies and sell<br>                      them at the store. <br>                      Unbeknownst to Richard, the store manager sends a copy of the game to the California Pacific Computer company, a computer<br>                      game publisher. Richard signs a contract with CPC to distribute the game. CPC distributes the game on 5.25" disks, and it sells over<br>                      30,000 copies. <p>                 Fall<p>                      Richard enrolls in the University of Texas. <br>                      Richard begins work on Ultima along with his friend Ken Arnold, working out of his parents' bedroom closet. <p>                 1980<p>                 Winter<p>                      Richard joins up with the University of Texas chapter of the Society for Creative Anachronism, meeting several of the friends that<br>                      would later become integral to the games. <p>                 Summer<p>                      Ultima is published by California Pacific. <p>                 1981<p>                      The movie Time Bandits is released. Richard and his friends visit the movie theatres repeatedly trying to copy the maps used in the<br>                      movie, and use the idea in the design of Ultima II. <br>                      California Pacific goes out of business. Richard signs a deal with upstart Sierra Online to produce and distribute his games, because<br>                      they are the only company that will agree to including a cloth map with each copy. <br>                      The first IBM PCs are sold. <p>                 1982<p>                 Summer<p>                      Ultima II is released for the Apple II. <br>                      Sierra makes Richard a less than desirable deal on royalties for a PC port of Ultima II. This leads Richard to begin thinking about a<br>                      new distributor. <p>                 Fall<p>                      Richard drops out of full-time study at the University of Texas, so that he can concentrate on work for Ultima III. He is still working<br>                      out of his parents' house in Houston. <br>                      Chuck Bueche does the Atari 800 port of Ultima II for Sierra, and meets Richard. <p>                 1983<p>                 Spring<p>                      Origin Systems is founded by Richard Garriott, Robert Garriott, Owen Garriott (their father) and Chuck Bueche. Development is<br>                      done in Houston, and the financial affairs are handled through an office at Robert's house in Andover, Massachusetts. Origin's official<br>                      address is: PO Box 99, Andover MA 01845. <br>                      Origin hires its first outside employee, Jeff Hillhouse. Jeff is also Sir Geoffrey in the later games. <p>                 Fall<p>                      Robert moves to Londonderry, New Hampshire where his wife has taken a job. Origin's official address becomes: 340 Harvey<br>                      Road, Mancester NH 03103. <br>                      Origin releases Ultima III for the Apple II. <p>                 1984<p>                      Origin signes a distribution deal with Electronic Arts Affiliated Labels. <p>                 1985<p>                      Origin moves all of their development staff to the New Hampshire office so that Robert won't have to commute so often. <p>                 Fall<p>                      In September, Ultima IV is completed and released for the Apple II. <p>                 1986<p>                      Origin acquires the rights to Ultimas I and II, and begins rewriting them for inclusion in the Ultima Trilogy. <br>                      Origin moves most of its development staff to Austin and changes its official address to: 136 Harvey Road, Londonderry NH<br>                      03053. <p>                 1987<p>                      Origin signs a distribution deal with Broderbund. <p>                 1988<p>                      Ultima V is released for the Apple II. It is the last Ultima for Apple. <p>                 1989<p>                      Origin consolidates all of its offices in Austin, changing its official address again: PO Box 161750, Austin TX 78716. <br>                      The Nintendo version of Ultima III is released in Japan, amidst a media blitz that sees Lord British splashed across billboards and<br>                      TV screens. <p>                 1990<p>                 Summer<p>                      Ultima VI is released for PC, marking the tenth anniversary of the original Ultima. <br>                      The Official Book of Ultima is published. <p>                 Fall<p>                      Savage Empire is released. <p>                 1991<p>                 Spring<p>                      Martian Dreams is released. <p>                 Fall<p>                      Stygian Abyss is released. <p>                 1992<p>                 Summer<p>                      Ultima VII is released, the last Ultima released independently by Origin. <p>                 Fall<p>                      Labyrinth of Worlds is released. <br>                      Electronic Arts buys Origin. <p>                 1993<p>                 Summer<p>                      Serpent Isle is released. <p>                 1994<p>                 Spring<p>                      Ultima VIII is released. <p>                 1995<p>                 Spring<p>                      Origin creates a patch for Ultima VIII, which includes significant changes to gameplay, plot, and control. The patch is made available<br>                      for free via the Internet. Shortly thereafter, updated CD versions of the game appear in stores. <p>                 1996<p>                 Spring<p>                      In April, Origin holds the alpha test for Ultima Online. Thousands of players participate in the largest Internet gaming environment<br>                      ever seen. <p>                 Spring<p>                      Origin starts taking applications for the Ultima Online beta test, scheduled to be held in 1997. Eventually, over 50,000 people sign<br>                      up and pay $2 to receive a copy of the beta CD. <p>                 1997<p>                 Winter<p>                      In an effort to get Ultima Online out the door, Origin shifts all development personnel away from the Ultima IX project so they can<br>                      work on Ultima Online. <p>                 Spring<p>                      In April, Origin launches the final version of the Ultima Online web site. <p>                 Summer<p>                      In June, Origin finally ships the CDs for the first phase of the Ultima Online beta test. Only a few thousand CDs are sent out. <br>                      In July, Origin ships the CDs for the second phase of the Ultima Online beta test. Everyone, including those who participated in the<br>                      first phase, receives new CDs. The test lasts approximately two months and involves thousands of players. <p>                 Fall<p>                      In September, Origin ends the Ultima Online beta test and officially releases the commercial version of the game. A great deal of<br>                      heated debate ensues regarding whether the game was ready for release or needed more development. <p>                 1998<p>                 Summer<p>                      Approximate expected release date for Ultima IX: Ascension. <p>                 2000<p>                      The 20th anniversary of Ultima! <p><p><p><p><br>                                                        <p>                                            Home | Art | Audio | Books | Clothing | Titles | Platforms | Miscellany <p>              Ultima is a trademark of Origin Systems, Inc.
