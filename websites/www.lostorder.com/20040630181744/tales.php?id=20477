<h2>The Black Fortress Part 1</h2>
<div class="tale">
	<h5>By: Santiago</h5>
	<div class="text">
		The Black Fortress<br />
by Santiago<br />
<br />
His eyes fluttered open, and all he saw were flames. A few seconds' focus revealed a fireplace, where a host of bright orange revelers danced, flickered and writhed before him under a canopy of stone. He stared wearily at them for a few seconds, and then shut his eyes again.<br />
<br />
Darkness, cold and numb. Memories of ice, miles and miles of frozen emptiness. Too cold to think, to move -- too cold to live.<br />
<br />
Where was he now? He forced his eyes to open again, and this time cast them upward. A dark, vaulted ceiling. Cobwebs. Was this heaven or hell? It didn't look like heaven.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and reached deeper into the gloom of memory. He had been looking for something...what was it? More cobwebs. He tried to brush them away, but it was no use. He felt himself slipping back into oblivion, and he didn't bother to resist.<br />
<br />
No, not hell. He felt sure of that, now. Hell would not have been this cold.<br />
What day was it? How long had he been in this place, wherever it was? Days? Weeks? Months? He had been dreaming, of faraway places and distant lands. But now...<br />
<br />
He wrapped his arms around himself underneath the covers. As chilly as the rest of the chamber might have been, he was warm and snug beneath several thick blankets. He smiled contentedly and rolled over on his other side, reveling in the luxurious sensation of skin sliding against warm cloth. Maybe it wasn't heaven, either -- but it was close. He closed his eyes and tried to bury himself deeper in his cozy cocoon.<br />
<br />
And again he remembered the terrible cold. He remembered falling down in the snow. He had tried; he had struggled with all his might to rise again. But his might was all gone. He was exhausted, too tired to do anything except to marvel at the softness of his own deathbed. So close, he thought...so close to his destination...<br />
<br />
Santiago's eyes snapped wide open, and he suddenly realized where he was.<br />
"The Black Fortress," he whispered.<br />
<br />
"Actually, it's a rather dark shade of grey," came a voice from nearby. <br />
<br />
Santiago's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly sat up. Near the fireplace -- in a couch that had been empty just a moment ago -- sat a dark-haired man. His clothes were formal and elegant, as were his features. He held his head in his hand -- a thumb upon his finely-chiseled jawbone, two fingers resting upon his temple, and the other two fingers draped casually across his smiling lips.<br />
<br />
"Do not be alarmed, Santiago," he said. "We will not harm you."<br />
<br />
"We?" the seafarer asked, his eyes darting around. A second figure seemed to materialize right in front of the fireplace -- a tall, dark-robed man, with long, unkempt red hair and eyes that seemed to glow like the fire behind him.<br />
<br />
"That is Mesostopheles," said the man in the chair, "and I am Vyktr."<br />
<br />
"I'm Santiago...but I guess ye knew that already."<br />
<br />
"Yes, I recognize you," growled Mesostopheles. "You're a filthy drunkard, and a sworn enemy. Now tell me what you're doing here, before I rip you into little pieces."<br />
<br />
"Calm down, Mesostopheles," said Vyktr. "This 'enemy' has come a long way to find us, nearly losing his own life in the process. I, for one, am curious to know why."<br />
<br />
"I'll be happy to tell ye, matey...but first off, ye got anythin' to drink 'round here?"<br />
<br />
Vyktr smiled ominously. "Well, nothing you would particularly enjoy. But there is water in that pitcher." He gestured toward a small table beside the sofa.<br />
Santiago reached over and poured himself a glass, then retreated back beneath the warm covers. "Whar's me clothes?" he asked.<br />
<br />
"Drying by the fireplace."<br />
<br />
"Ah! I see 'em. Well, if ye look in me boots, ye'll find a dag..."<br />
<br />
"You mean this one?" Vyktr asked, holding an ornate dagger in his slender fingers.<br />
<br />
"Aye, that's the one. A couple weeks ago, a friend o' mine was done to death by that thar blade. Trouble is, I'm the one what's blamed fer it. I reckon the guards is prob'ly on the lookout fer me in every town, not to mention assassins an' bounty hunters. I din't want to come here, but I had nowhar else to go."<br />
<br />
"An unfortunate situation," said the vampire. "But I still don't understand what you want from us. Is it sanctuary? Do you want us to shelter you from the hand of the law?" Mesostopheles uttered a cry of protest, but Vyktr motioned him to be silent.<br />
<br />
Santiago shook his head. "Naw, I don't want to stay here -- not that ye ain't hospitable or nothin'. Undead just plain give me the creeps. No offense to ye!" he hastily added.<br />
<br />
Vyktr laughed. "None taken."<br />
<br />
"What I want," continued Santiago, "what I was hopin' ye mought be able to do, is tell me who owns that dag, so as I can have a bit o' justice, an' maybe clear me name. An' I figgered ye mought be able to do it, seein' as how y'all are...well...ye know..."<br />
<br />
"Evil?" said Vyktr.<br />
<br />
"Aye, thar's the word! So I figgered, since ye was evil an' all -- though ye seem awful nice fer evil folks -- I was thinkin' maybe ye mought be able to cast some sort o' spell or somethin' to weed out the villain what's behind all this. Ye know what they says...it takes one to know one."<br />
<br />
"Oh. Yes. Of course," said Mesostopheles. "You thought we would help you -- just like that." He snapped his taloned fingers. <br />
<br />
"I din't know if ye would or not. But I got no place else to go. I ain't got no swords against any o' ye, long as ye don't got no swords against me. Ye do what ye do, an' I do what I do, an' if we're both lucky, we won't cross up with each other more than what's necessary. I ain't yer enemy, nor are ye mine. I'm just askin' this one favor, 'cause I ain't got no one else to ask it to. An' whether ye do it or not, I'll be out o' yer hair after that. Those of ye that got hair, anyways."<br />
<br />
Vyktr studied Santiago for a moment. "That's all?"<br />
<br />
The pirate nodded. "That's the whole fish."<br />
<br />
The vampire's delicate features did not change. There were no ripples to betray the troubled thoughts that boiled beneath that smooth surface. Surprise, confusion, suspicion, concern -- all of these passed by without notice, culminating in a simple nod. "Very well," he said.<br />
<br />
With a wave of his pale hand, the deadly weapon began to glow. There was a brief pulse of wan light, and then nothing. Vyktr placed the dagger upon the table and gestured toward it. "The weapon will now point you in the direction of its owner, until either you or he is dead."<br />
<br />
Santiago reached for the blade and gingerly picked it up. "Well I'll be darned," he muttered, watching as it pointed toward the far end of the room. "I can't say as I trust magic, but this is a right handy spell. Thankee, matey!"<br />
Vyktr smiled calmly. "Don't mention it."<br />
<br />
"An' that's it, then? I can go?" Santiago asked, glancing nervously at the demon.<br />
<br />
"Yes," said the vampire. "As soon as you're dressed, I'll take you back to your ship." Mesostopheles gnashed his teeth and clenched his fists, but said not a word.<br />
<br />
For the first time, Santiago was glad to be out in the bitter cold of the North Sea. He stood once more upon the deck of the Peregrine, alive and well -- which is more than he hoped for when he first came to this haunted isle.<br />
<br />
Mr. Knife was safe and sound, snoozing contentedly in the ship's hold beneath several warm blankets. The old tillerman had remained true to his word, and had not abandoned his captain. Santiago could not help but be touched, and he was even willing to overlook the fact that most of the ale was gone.<br />
<br />
Vyktr stood at the prow of the vessel, his dark cape fluttering in the arctic gale. He did not shiver; his teeth did not chatter, nor did he wrap his arms around himself to ward away the chill. He simply stood there and stared at the dark, icy sea.<br />
<br />
Santiago stamped his foot nervously on the deck, partly to keep his foot from getting numb, and partly to attract the attention of the silent figure that stood at the prow of the vessel, his dark cape fluttering in the arctic gale. Vyktr's invulnerability to the cold unnerved the pirate more than a little. He did not shiver; his teeth did not chatter, nor did he wrap his arms around himself to ward away the chill. He simply stood there and stared at the dark, icy sea. If Santiago had watched him drink blood, even if he had watched him rise up out of a coffin, it would not have disturbed him as much as seeing him stand there, unmoved by the bitter torments of winter. He wanted Vyktr to go away; he wanted to sail back to warm, southern seas once more. He wanted this dark isle to be nothing more than a memory.<br />
<br />
"Make no mistake, Santiago," said the vampire at last, his dark eyes never moving from the bleak, watery horizon. "We would have killed you. Or worse." A careful emphasis was placed upon the last word, leaving Santiago to imagine what could be 'worse'. "You are alive for only one reason, and that is because <br />
Azalin ordered us not to harm you."<br />
<br />
Santiago frowned. "Why do ye s'pose that is, eh?"<br />
<br />
"Azalin does nothing without reason. He has some purpose in mind for you; I have no doubt of it. You must be cautious in the days ahead."<br />
<br />
"Aye, I'll keep both eyes open," said the pirate. "Thankee, sir. But..."<br />
<br />
"But why do I tell you this?"<br />
<br />
Santiago nodded. "I mean, yer one of 'em, ain't ye?"<br />
<br />
"I am a creature of darkness, it's true," said Vyktr. "Fate has led me down a dark path, a path that leads in only one direction, with no hope of ever turning back. I have little choice in what I do. But you...you are a simple creature. Carefree, naïve, foolish at times -- I would even go as far as to call you innocent, though that hardly seems appropriate. I envy you, for the life that you have -- more life than the whole lot of those who dwell in the Black Fortress. So when I see that the darkness is hungry, I caution you to avoid its teeth. I would see you spared whatever dark fate that they have in mind for you," he said, gesturing toward the Isle of Winter.<br />
<br />
"Well thankee again, matey. It's a right good thing o' ye, settin' me on the lookout. If I can ever do ye a good turn, just let me know, eh?"<br />
Vyktr smiled. "I'll keep that in mind. Farewell, Santiago...and good luck." The vampire's features darkened, coalesced and shrank until there was only a tiny bat, fluttering up into the night.<br />
<br />
Santiago set the enchanted blade upon the deck and watched as it spun around slowly -- like a compass, but pointing southward. Like fate.<br />
<br />
"Fate be darned," he muttered. "I'm gonna have meself an ale! If thar's any left, that is." He climbed below deck and tipped the tillerman's hammock upside-down, sending the old salt toppling to the deck.<br />
<br />
"Wake up, ye ol' coot! We got work to do!"
