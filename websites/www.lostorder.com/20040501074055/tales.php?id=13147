	<h4>One Heart Two Souls</h4>
	<h5>By: Aanlain</h5>
	<br>
	<div class="text">One Heart, Two Souls<br />
By Aanlain<br />
<br />
Day 1<br />
It has been a week now since I have seen my love. I do not think she yet knows the extent to which I have fallen for her. My every waking moment I have her image burned upon my brain. I get distracted often in combat, and I do not know where I am at times.<br />
<br />
I have been sending her messages, sometimes with packages. I hope she is getting them, and thinks of me. I have traveled the world looking for meaning, both to increase my skills, and to leave Azra to her own devices so that she may develop her own style and methods, and to let her confidence in herself build.<br />
<br />
She has the makings of a fine druid; I know in my heart that she will do well. The sun has just risen over the Butcherblock Mountains and I must break camp for the day. I will write more when I have time.<br />
<br />
Day 4<br />
3 days have passed without letup in this storm. I share a cave with a kodiak cub and a mist wolf pup. We make an odd trio, yet all 3 share a fear of the vicious winds and lightning that prevail outside. I have not been able to get a message to Azra, the boats are not sailing now, and I am afraid the lightning may affect any teleport spell I try to cast. I have befriended the 2 young ones and they help to keep me warm. Though I find it odd to wake up with a bear's leg draped over me.<br />
<br />
Day 5<br />
The skies had cleared and I received word that I was needed in the commons of Antonica. I teleported to the commons and was greeted by long time friends Azlana, Xirius, Alainuws, and Amarin. An expedition to the temple of Cazic Thule had been planned and my assistance was needed. We made the arduous journey on foot, and arrived at the temple by nightfall. Friend Woozle joined us as we arrived and we began the trek inside. Azlana, ever curious was still bent on learning the ways of meditation. She at times has made the days with out my love more bearable, her innocent curiosity and ribald sense of humor make the hours pass as minutes. I had given her a book in an adventure past, that she might concentrate on it to meditate. This trip I placed a sketch of my love inside and a poem. I have also included the poem here so that if my journal is ever found that my words of love will not be lost.<br />
<br />
<i>The forge within burns ever brighter<br />
Fueled by flames of love<br />
Her eyes, her laugh, her beaming smile<br />
Haunt my dreams at night<br />
In the morning when I wake<br />
She's nowhere in my sight<br />
I yearn to go back in time<br />
To see her again that day <br />
When first mine eyes <br />
Fell upon my love<br />
Who stole my heart away </i><br />
<br />
As I write this poem again, a tear falls from my cheek. I fear that when I return to the Northlands that she will have forgotten me. She may never know the effect she has had on me, or the heights to which I would soar to make her happy. I grow weary of writing in my journal, as each stroke makes me yearn more for my love.<br />
<br />
Day 7<br />
I received word today from Azra. How bright the day seemed when the messenger arrived. I opened the note to see these words.<br />
<br />
<i>Greetings Master Aanlain, <br />
I thank you for the many gifts ya have sent me<br />
I am learning more every day<br />
The things ya have taught me have allowed <br />
Me to take down foes that I had great difficulty in<br />
Doing so before. I will make ye proud.<br />
<br />
Yer apprentice and friend, <br />
Azra<br />
</i><br />
My heart hung heavy after reading these words. A very simple thank you note, but what could I expect? We had been together a very short time, but I thought that there might be something there. I went through the motions of living today, barely speaking to anyone. The two orphans I befriended continue to follow me around so I have taken to making the cave my home. The citizens of Kaldim take a dim view of creatures of their ilk roaming freely in town.<br />
<br />
Day 9<br />
The day dawned bright and clear. Winter is coming to Kaladim, I could smell it in the air. The wolf pup has run off, apparently it has found a pack to join. I spotted them in the woods today bringing down a buck so I think he will be fine. I have no children so I don't know for sure what it feels like to have a child leave and make their own way, but I think I got a taste of it today. I received a package of letters in Kaladim when I went in for supplies. Cyrssi is doing well and progressing through her training quickly, I look forward to the day that I may preside with my brother at her naming ceremony. Perth also sent word; he has apprenticed himself with a halfling pottery maker of all things! He intends to have a skill at which he can work when he is old and feeble. Bah! I say, I was born in these woods, and I will die in them no doubt.<br />
Everett has been hunting in the Karanas to great success and seems to be doing well. The last was a note from my Azra. When I saw it, I was not sure if I wanted the pain of seeing another neutral and informative letter from her. I overcame those feelings and opened the note. It read as so:<br />
<br />
<i>Aanlain, <br />
<br />
I fell through the ice yesterday and am<br />
Recovering from a cold in Halas.<br />
These days you have been gone, though exciting <br />
Have been empty. I find myself thinking of you <br />
Often but I am unsure why. When you are able <br />
Please return to Halas and find me, we must talk.<br />
<br />
Azra</i><br />
<br />
How my heart screamed with joy, yet it was tempered quickly with the thought that it may not be what I think. So confusing are these matters of love!<br />
<br />
Day 12<br />
I have stopped in Qeynos for the night. It is cold and dreary and the wind howls through the eaves of the inn where I stay. It has been a fortnight since anyone has heard from my nephew Elandel. He has disappeared without a trace and I fear for his safety. I find it hard to sleep this evening, only the weather keeps me from pressing on to Halas and my love. Thoughts of the future and what Azra wants from me buzz through my head like angry hornets, and I with no river to jump into to avoid them lay awake and write these ramblings. I was able to sneak the bear cub up to the room with me, as this inn has a separate outbuilding, he now lays at my feet and snores, adding to my already difficult time in sleeping.<br />
<br />
Day 13<br />
A light snow covers the ground outside and a messenger came with it. A great blizzard has closed the pass to Halas, the young barbarian messenger arrived here badly hurt, frostbite haven taken an ear and a foot. He delivered his message to me, and I bade him to rest in my bead while I attend his wounds. Once I had cleaned him up I opened the note with shaking hands. It was a message from Azra again! It read as follows:<br />
<br />
<i>My sweet druid, <br />
Ye said if I ever need to get word to ye to give a message to any passing druid and so I hope this makes it to ye. <br />
Ye have told me at times I am stubborn and this time I must admit ye are right. I wanted to get just one more trooper and whilst I was just about to snare it an orc shaman came behind me and rooted me to the ground. I did manage to live but barely and my injuries are too severe this time. <br />
A kind soul passing by helped me back to Halas where I am hold up in yer barbarian friend's home. I await a healer, as these wounds are too great for my meager skills. <br />
I hope this note finds ye. <br />
Yer Azra</i><br />
<br />
How my heart pained to hear of her injuries, but I knew in my heart that she is strong, and would survive all but the gravest of injuries. I delivered the injured young barbarian to the temple of life, and returned her e to write this notation. I leave now for Blackburrow to assist with the clearing of the pass, so that I might return to my love.</div>
