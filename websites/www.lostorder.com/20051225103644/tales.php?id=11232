<h2>Wyll's Journal - Day Five</h2>

		Wyll's Journal - Day Five<br />
By Wyll<br />
<br />
"Can it get any worse" is the phrase I've been repeating to myself for the last few hours. I am convinced this prophecy is nothing more than a curse to myself and my family. Guided by the clues embedded in those lines and by those individuals caught in its web we've learned many painful things about ourselves and those we hold most dear. Ah, but I shouldn't get ahead of myself, allow me to recap the events of today.<br />
<br />
Awaking among the druid stones I groggily made my way to Ak'anon where I was to meet up with my brothers in the tavern. I think next time I'll select somewhere that doesn't serve spirits for when I arrived my brothers Wysll, Wyloon and Wyndelle were barely able to pick themselves off the floor they were so drunk. Several hours passes as I waited for their speech to return to normal and the staggering to calm to a mere wobble in their step. I didn't enjoy the thought of talking to Uncle Wyndsor any more than they did, but I think they went a bit overboard in "drowning their pain".<br />
<br />
When everyone was finally sober we made our way down the Abbey where we knew uncle would be, as usual, praying to Brell. I think he immediately noted the seriousness of our demeanor and indicated for us to move out front, away from the place of worship. Moving out front we immediately lit into our dear uncle concerning both his lies to us about our father and the truth behind our mother's murder. Wyndsor was quite defensive for a time there, but soon, his strength let out and he caved under the pressure of our questions and our demand for the truth.<br />
<br />
What bothers me is, I'm still not sure we got it. Uncle confirmed our father's story that he had loved Daillia but was unable to bring her into the Light, and he was crushed when father married her. However, he denied out-right that he was responsible for her murder. In fact, he pointed to a most unlikely suspect, that of our grandfather. I was just as stunned as the rest, none of us had ever actually known our grandfather and now, out of nowhere, he is implicated in the death of our own mother? Bah! And then we found out who our grandfather was...and if I thought we were stunned before, now we were just...well, stunned much more (I'm sure my more learned brothers would come up with something better to say). Wyndsor said our grandfather was none other than the insane hermit Wyzerach that wanders the Steamfont talking to himself of whirling windies and the like!<br />
<br />
Uncle said that Wyzer was long ago a wizard in King Ak'anon's court, a trusted advisor. However, in his search for power and wisdom, Wyzer sought out the other planes and was eventually able to actually walk them. Shortly after he started these journeys to the other planes he went insane, speaking of some war between Light and Darkness and the end of the world...the kind of stories we've heard since our childhood. As could be expected, Wyzer was banished from the king's court and practically written out of the histories of Ak'anon and the gnome-kind. I'm not real sure what to think about this. The old coot is clearly insane, but if he is family then...he is a part of me and my brothers. To be written out of history because he tried to do something that had never been tried before by the gnomes is something that should be notable, not condemnable. Ah, but then, the dangers of such actions are clearly evident after what happened.<br />
<br />
Regardless, uncle explained how our grandfather, upon hearing that two of his sons were courting a member of the Darkmor family, went even more insane than he was. He raved about how the merging would bring the Darkness on the all the land and...well, more of the same...so Wyndsor says. This, uncle says, is what drove Wyzerach to murder Daillia, as she was a member of the Darkmor family.<br />
<br />
Upon finishing the explanation, uncle once again regained his strength and promptly ended the conversation and walking determinedly back into the Abbey. We were all left standing and gaping at this news...what were we supposed to think?<br />
<br />
First our father is missing and now alive, supposedly responsible for our mother's death (at least according to the people of Ak'anon). Father denies this and implicates his own brother, our uncle in our mother's murder. Our uncle denies this and accuses our own grandfather, a man we've never known, of Daillia's murder. I think my mind was completely numb by that point. All I could think to do next was find this Wyzerach and get the truth, if that was even possible. My brothers agreed with me and we headed off toward the Steamfont.<br />
<br />
Oh, and before I forget, during our talk with uncle, we had a couple visits. The to show up was our often lost brother, Wenceslaus who was surly as ever. Shortly after that we received a most unexpected visit, a young gnome girl named Wylia , who claims to be our niece. And you thought our family was complicated now! I say claims, because she isn't quite sure who her father is, but she suspects the rogue Wyxle. I'm sure Wyxle will deny this all the way to his grave, but I certainly wouldn't put it past him, that brother of mine has no sense of restraint. Unfortunately, we didn't have much time to get to know our pretty young niece, for she had some errands to run now that she was actually in the gnome underground. I'm not sure it would have mattered, we were all far too emotionally numb to deal with her arrival.<br />
<br />
So as I was saying, we were off to the Steamfont to search for our grandfather. Shortly after emerging from the city we found a group (once again) murdering the city guards. As if things were not bad enough, dark elves, ogres and even a couple brother gnomes beating up on our own city guards makes my blood boil. Apparently, brother Wyloon's blood burns even hotter as he challenged the ogre to duel. I'm afraid it wasn't much of a fight. The ogre swiftly took down my dear brother with a few swift blows, the poor fella had not a chance. I would have challenged the lumbering oaf myself if I weren't so focused on this quest...there are more important things than flexing your muscle, and as much as I despise those creatures, if I am tasked with saving the world, them included, I will do what is right and follow the path of Light.<br />
<br />
We found our grandfather...how could we miss this old crotchety gnome talking to himself out in the middle of nowhere? We attempted to approach him, usually to no effect, once in a while he would look up and almost seem to recognize us, but then return to his private conversation. It wasn't until I asked flat out if he was responsible for the death of our mother...and then the strangest thing happened. His mind seemed to clear...I mean, I couldn't see it, but his eyes actually focused on us and he seemed to be talking in a well, in a sane manner. I can't fully translate what he did say (he had an annoying tendency to speak in old gnomish...or, that's what I think, anyway, I couldn't understand everything, perhaps he wasn't as sane as I thought). He basically said that he hadn't killed Daillia, that somebody named the Lady Darkmor, Dracara Darkmor, I think he said, was responsible. He said that she lives in a dark place, a place of evil and that she will bring the Darkness upon the lands of Norrath. On second thought, I think the old coot is still insane. Perhaps he speaks the truth, but I'll be damned if I can understand what it is supposed to mean.<br />
<br />
Besides now it seems our uncle is once again a liar and our grandfather is innocent...There is so much going on I don't know what to think, maybe I should just accept the fact that the Walaryn family is cursed, but I find it difficult to believe that we are an evil folk...or even tragic...Bah! I don't care anymore, and this prophecy has brought more pain and heartache than anything I have ever encountered. Perhaps I should burn it or maybe just return it to Useah, I care not for what it has brought upon myself and my brothers.<br />
<br />
So here I am, outside the gates of Ak'anon, writing in my little book wondering what has happened to my life in the last few days. The world is a strange place, and Brell has a funny way of showing us what is in the hearts of our friends and family.
