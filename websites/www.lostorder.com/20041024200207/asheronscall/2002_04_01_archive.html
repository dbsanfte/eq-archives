Well Brimstone's been at it again.  He's redesigned the template for the main LOA page (<a href="http://www.lostorder.com/">www.lostorder.com</a>) and frankly I think it kicks some major shreth.  The guild leadership has also pretty much agreed that we should have one news page for all chapters, so I'll be posting all the AC related news to that page in the future.<p>

What are you waiting for?  Go read the news on the <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/">main guild page</a>!</p>

				<p class="news_header">Attack of the Killer Statues! - by El-Sayed ibn Aly</p>

After being away from the world of Dereth for almost a week I return to find much changed, some of which is not for the better. I stripped down to my girth (in typical Gharudium fashion) and took a stroll/shopping trip through the streets of ancient Qualabar only to most suddenly and unexpectedly meet a deadly new enemy. As I stood by the jewelers shop greeting fellow shoppers (and doing a trade or two) I feel the crackle of magic in the air. My hair stands on end, indicating to me I have just been cursed with a type of magic vulntrability spell. As I start to turn around I am hit in quick succession by three powerful magical bludgeon attacks and fall on the ground stuned (ok, ok..dead actually!)....

This Sunday's quest will be a general romp though Marae Lassel.  We'll make a trip to the Othoi Pincer dungeons and attempt to find Hea Temanua for El-Sayed.  Depending on how fast we tear through the pincer quests and find Temanua we may make a trip to northern osteth in search of ruined amulets as well.  Also if there's a general consensus to run through a different quest on Sunday I'm open to any options.  See you in Dereth!</p>

Also this Sunday's quest will be a bit of a free for all.  We'll meet on the Rithwic bridge at 2pm and decide as a group what to do and where to do it.  Options include another run through of the Nuhmudira's Fate quest, or a hunt in north osteth for the ruined amulates.</p>

				<p class="news_header">BigBrother 2.1.821 Release</p>
There's actually been two updated to BigBrother since my last post:  Here's the change log, once again I'd highly recommend this pluging for anyone in the allgiance.
<blockquote>
<b>Version 2.1.821:</b>
Changes: <br>
Added the HUD! The HUD is basically a little configurable thing I draw on top of the AC GUI directly. It can contain your local time, your local coords, and the time left on your buffs (see below)<br>
Added buff time tracking. You can basically pick a spell to be your "buff timer" spell (mine's lightning protect 7 for example) and that spell's remaining time will show up in the HUD.<br>
BB no longer uses character stats to track current health/max health etc. etc. This should fix some issues people have been having with beta decals.<br>
Fixed a couple minor bugs<p>

<a href="">2.1.821 Install</a>
<p>
<b>version 2.1.820:</b><p>
Changes: <br>
Much improved component tracking/pea splitting.<br>
XP tracking on kills ([BB] You bring Tusker Guard to a fiery end! (For 12824xp)<br>
BB now tracks your resist rate against monsters. ([BB] Banderling Mangler cast Fire Vulnerability Other IV on you Your resist rate is 67/79 (85%))<br>
BB tracks the last 10 death locations/when you died. If you die inside a dungeon, it will attempt to track what landblock/plaintext dungeon name it is, but the database of <br>landblocks is pretty weak at this point. If you notice that it doesn't know the dungeon, please type .landblock inside the place and .im me the name/landblock so I can add it.<br>
You can emphasize the name (change the color) of a person sending you a tell/that you're telling.<br>
Slightly improves endurance/self tracking for mana/stamina/health tracking.<br>
Lifestone tracking as a nearby item is now optional.

				<p class="news_header">Quest Report - Nuhmudira's Fate</p>
Nothing like a long run and 5% vitae to define the typical LOA quest...
<p>
Loka Mar and I met in Rithwic, and she was gracious enough to wait patiently
while I ran to Eastham to get a portal tie as close to the Geldite library
as I could.  That process too about 10 minutes but soon we were standing in
a cottage settlement south west of Stonehold buffing for the run to the
library.  The run itself was uneventful although I did have to stop and play
with a pair of oak golems (I couldn't resist *grins*)  Soon we found
ourselves just inside the entrance to the library.

Yup, another new version of <a href="http://www.darkisles.com/bigbrother/">BigBrother</a>
<blockquote>
version 2.1.819:<p>

Changes: <br>
Fixes to the last BB release involving spellcasting filters. Please retry the overide self spellcast features with -magic UNFILTERED. (@unfilter -magic)<br>
Lots of improvements (IMO) to general in-game messages. Optionally add all sorts of useful information to the various attack/get hit/cast spells/etc. (Check your options)<br>
Added typeable ways to do the various spell recalls. Valid commands are: .lr (lifestone recall), .pr (last portal recall), .pr1 (recall 1st tie), .pr2, .ar (aerlinthe), and .sr (sanct recall) <br>
Added automatic pea splitting. This is the first release of this, so report issues to me. I know one bug is if you have multiple stacks of components it may think you're low on a comp.<br>
Filtered peas as low components.<br>
Optionally filter self evade messages from AC<br>
Optionally filter the new green annoying @recall messages (recall to lifestone/house/mansion)<p>

				<p class="news_header">BigBrother 2.1.818 Released</p>
Smirking Revenge has released yet another version of <a href="http://www.darkisles.com/bigbrother/">BigBrother</a>.  From the BigBrother news page:
<blockquote>
version 2.1.818:<p>
Changes: <br>
Spell words! ([BigBrother] You say, "Malar Zhavik" (Revitalize))<br>
Made @filter -spellcasting EXTREMELY useful for PKs. Now you can filter all the white dot spells but still see red dot spell words (and the plaintext versions too!)<br>
Made @filter -magic actually usefull by filtering out the annoying crap (spell consumed/magic rushes through you) and adding spell words to it<br>
Added compoenent tracking! You can set an amount for it to check on every time you burn a comp. It will then alert your that you're running low<br>
PK/Person Tracking has been expanded to recognize all the new portal spells + @lifestone + @house recall + @house mansion_recall<br>
Changed the nearby list to remove items when you click on the ICON instead of the coordinates<br>
Fixed nearby tracking to track EVERYTHING (it was tracking a large subset of items, but it'd miss things like books/pages)<br>
If am IM was sent more then a couple minutes ago, the time it was sent is printed (useful for offline messages).<p>

<a href="http://www.darkisles.com/bigbrother/files/BBInstaller.msi">2.1.818 Install</a></blockquote>
I very highly recommend this plug-in for all members of the LOA and my Allegiance.

<b>I have noticed when I go into the Residential Quarters there is quite a bit of lag and sometimes I even get disconnected. Is there something going on? </b><p>
With the introduction of Residential Quarters, we have seen some performance issues, such as an increase in lag reports and server disconnects. We are working on this situation and hope to have a fix soon. Additionally, we have decided to temporarily suspend additional Residential Quarters and landscape housing for the month of May. Instead, we will take this time to evaluate the system and identify ways to resolve these performance issues. We apologize for the inconvenience and we will keep you up to date on our progress for fixing the current situation. </blockquote>

				<p class="news_header">Quest - the Fate of Nuhmudira</p>
Sunday I plan on leading a group to find and choose the fate of Nuhmurdira.  Responcible both for our homes, the statues in the towns, crystal golems (and their lord) as well as the murder of countless in the persuit of the power to defend out new world from a feared yalini invasion.  From what I have been told, we are given the power of death over her, but we must choose to either die as an offer of live and forgivness to her, or live and curse her to death and hades.<p>

I don't yet know my choice but I know I wish to make it, for I fear this choice will have great ramifications in future months.</p>

There is a new version of BigBrother posted that takes over much of the functionality of Sixth Sense, as well as adding some new chat features.  I'd very strongly suggested that you download and keep BigBrother running while in game.  The guild and server chat features of this plugin are enough to make it a must have, but some of the new functionaly really makes it indispensable.  There's a link to the BigBrother web side in the sidebar to the left.</p>

				<p class="news_header">Quest Reminder - Quiddity Ingots Part 3 Thursday April 11</p>
This Thrusday night we'll finally finish the quiddity ingot quest.  Execpt more of the duel elementals and hollow othoi we faced in the first two parts, lots and lots more.  Also expect all manor of simulacra, drudge and hollow minions.  With a good team and a bit of care we should be fine and really show Martine what we think of his plans.<p>

As planned 8pm EST found a sizable group assembled at the Zaikhal portal drop waiting for the trip to the Heiromancer's Halls.  Asha had a bit of trouble with the portal tie but soon enough we were on our way to the hall.  El-Sayed set the tone for the evening on the way when he tried to follow his intrepid (and nuts as a squirrel) monarch of the edge of a cliff as a short cut.  
<p>
At least I was able to pick the various death items off his corpse.

				<p class="news_header">Quest Report - Quiddity Ingots Part 1 and Part 2 (makeup)</p>
This Sunday's quest was a very quick one.  The only one that needed a key part as El-Sayed and conveniently enough he needed the part that I still had a tie for.
<p>
He and I met at my cottage, buffed up and portaled our way into the dungeon.  There we met another intrepid adventurer looking to get the teeth for his own key.  We carved through the drudges and simulacra like they weren't even there...

				<p class="news_header">April Teaser Up: Betrayal</p>
She wore her fatigue as a thick and heavy cloak draped over her mind. It helped protect her from the terror threatening to overwhelm her. And when the fatigue was not enough to stop her from thinking about the events of the last few months, she turned to anger. The incandescent flame of rage burned away any shreds of panic that managed to break through the dull layers of sleeplessness. 
<p>
Betrayal. Betrayal at every turn. Betrayed by Asheron, who brought her to this strange land. Betrayed by Thorsten as his lifespark vanished on the end of that demon's pincer. And now betrayed by Nuhmudira, next to Asheron her closest advisor.

				<p class="news_header">Quest Report - Quiddity Ingots Part 2</p>
Well this week's quest dungeon sure was interesting.  Loka Mar and myself met on the Rithwic bridge and started the buffing process.  I don't know about Mar but I didn't bother to pull out my hollow suit even though I had heard horror stories about the augmented and altered othoi in the dungeon.
<p>
Fully buffed we portaled into the dungeon and fell a short way into a crowd of drudge stalkers, raveners, and simulacra.  We made short work of the welcoming party the started making our way down.  Soon we found ourselves staring at a small pit filled with more drudges and sims.  We decided to switch to our singularity weapons, so a short rebuff later we were wading into the fray below.

Sorry I didn't post a notice about tonight's developer chat, I forgot about it until I found the log on Crossroads of Dereth.  Speaking of the <a href="http://ac.xrgaming.net/index.php3?library=logs/zonechat_020403">developer's chat log</a> I'd strongly suggested you read it, as there are a lot of changes coming in next month's patch.  These changes include love for high strength and endurance characters, apartments for the homeless, and the discovery of a crystal lord (who's not going to be gentle with us)</p>

I've posted a new thread on the <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/forums/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=15">New and Upcoming Virtual Worlds</a> forum to gauge interest in Asheron's Call 2.  Head over to <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=2422">the thread </a> and sound off if you're planning on making the jump to AC2.  As the public beta and release approach we'll be evaluating interest level and deciding how to handle our transition to the Dereth of the future (or if the LOA will make an official transition to AC2 at all).  For those of you on the core list, you can reply to my message there as well.

				<p class="news_header">Welcome to the new LOA AC Chapter page!</p>
Once again I've revised the template for this page.  In the near future I'll do the same for the screenshots page and application page.  Eventually I expect Brimstone to redesign the <a href="http://www.lostorder.com">main guild page</a> at which time I'll revise this page again to match his template.</p>
In case you're curious where I got such a pretty template take a look at Brimstone's design for <a href="http://www.akalabeth.org">www.akalabeth.org</a> which is a core list favorite for becoming the new guild web page.  As always feel free to email me with comments and suggestions, though bear in mind I've got the artistic abilities of a 2 year old with big crayons and a white washed wall, so be gentle!</p>

				<p class="news_header">Quest Reminder Redux: Quiddity Ingots Part 2</p>
Since we didn't actually get together last week for the second part of the quiddity ingot quest, we'll try again this thursday.  Remeber to bring death items and some good hollow armor.  At least this week I have a direct tie so there's no long run needed.<p>
See you Thursday!</p>
