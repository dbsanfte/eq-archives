	<h4>An Untitled as Yet Tale</h4>
	<h5>By: Aanlain</h5>
	<br>
	<div class="text">An Untitled As Yet Tale<br />
By Aanlain Treeskin<br />
<br />
A loud banging at the door awoke Aanlain from a troubled sleep. "Just a darned moment" he mumbled as he stumbled to open the door.<br />
Aanlain had foregone his normal outdoor camp for a warmer and softer bed, the chill of winter had settled across the lands, and he thought he was due for a warm nights sleep. He opened the door a crack to see who it was that disturbed his rest.<br />
<br />
In the hallway stood a large armored human wearing the livery of the city guard. Wary of an armed and armored man at his door in the dead of night, Aanlain kept a hand hovering over his belt knife.<br />
<br />
"What can I do fer ya?" he asked the man. "This boy claims to be yours elf, and I aim to make sure he is afore I lock him up" stated the man in a gruff tone.<br />
Aanlain peered around the large man to see young elven lad being held in irons behind the man. His appearance was so like his long missing brother as to cause him to stare gaping at the boy.<br />
<br />
"Well!?" said the man. "Is he yers or not?" "Nay not mine, methinks for I havna dallied but the look of the boy is much akin to my brother" explained the druid "What's he done that he be in irons?" He asked.<br />
<br />
"We found im in old man Feagar's barn we did, kicked a lantern over and almost burned the place down. The old coot lost a couple baskets of eggs and half his hay afore we could get it put out. He'll be working off the fine he will," he said.<br />
Aanlain looked the boy over again and made up his mind. "If I pay the fine will ye release him unto me, so that I may care for the boy?" he asked. "Aye, but I willna have him terrorizing the local farmers anymore, one slip and yer both in irons, ye hear?" scolded the guardsman. "Aye, I hear," replied the druid.<br />
<br />
The guard released the boy and none-too-gently pushed him into the room. He stood at the door with his hand held out awaiting payment "4 platinum fer the damages, and... 3 platinum fer the fine" he said. Aanlain rolled his eyes knowing full well that old man Feagar wouldn't see half of it, but paid it nonetheless.<br />
The guard tromped down the hallway tossing a coin in the air as he went, whistling a bar tune as that was his most likely destination.<br />
<br />
Aanlain closed the door and motioned for the boy to have a seat. Aanlain crossed the room and sat down on the edge of the bed. "So boy do ye have a name or am I to continue calling you boy?" he asked.<br />
<br />
The young elf looked up from the floor and stared at the room he now found himself in. "My name is much the same as yers. Mother named me after ya, but I take no pride in the name. My name be Aanlayn," he said.<br />
Outside the guard stopped at the edge of the alley. The shadows spoke. "You have done well Haim, go now and this never happened. Speak not of how you got the money," said the darkness.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere....<br />
<br />
Skwizsh looked out over the shimmering sands of the Oasis. "Diz playz is tu hot Skwizsh tinks," he mumbled to himself. Skwizh removed his helm and brought out a tattered old rag from his pack and wiped the sweat from his eyes. "Skwizwh lyk it hot but not diz hot" he muttered.<br />
The distant thudding of a passing sand giant could be heard among the dunes as he continued to rest in the shade of the lee side of the dune out of the sun's glaring rays.<br />
<br />
"Woohoo!!" came a cheer from above Skwizsh. A dark shadow passed overhead and Skwizsh rolled out from under the shadow in a rush. Thinking himself under attack from another madman a made a dash for his spear. He turned back in time to see his brother land one third of the way down the slope of the dune on HIS shield... of all the things to use, but his shield! The troll slipped and slid down the dune to the bottom. He picked himself up and shook the sand from his armor and cheered at Skwizsh. "Dat wuz tu fun brudder yu shud try dat wunce!" cried Skwazsh. Just then a bard topped the dune opposite them playing a drum and singing a song of speed. "Make way ye louts!" he cried, "Mail delivery!" Skwazsh stepped out of the way as the Bard went by in a blur.<br />
<br />
Sand cascaded down the dune and the distant thudding began to approach, and no longer was it so distant. "Giant!" roared Skwazsh as he picked up the shield and began a mad dash up the dune. Just then a third troll jumped up from the other side of the dune. The bard looking back to see where the Giant was did not see the third troll appear. The sound of the two colliding thundered across the dune.<br />
<br />
The stunned bard slipped back down the dune, colliding with Skwazsh who was making his way up. "Diz wud be funny if not fer dat Giant comin" Skwizsh thought to himself as he rushed to pick up the two fallen adventurers.<br />
Skwizsh picked up the bard and threw him across his shoulder, then grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and helped him run the rest of the way up the dune. The canyons of the Oasis of Marr would make a good hiding spot if they could get there in time. Gathering his other brother Skwozsh hey imbued them all with the spirit of wolf and they sped off towards the oasis<br />
At the canyon wall a lone dark elf watched them all. A nod to no one in particular then he faded into the shadows.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere...<br />
<br />
Bagulan pored over the maps he had collected over time. The smell of things dark and secret hung in the air and his mood was equally so. "Fah! There is no mention of it here. I must find it!" he muttered. A thumping at his door shook him from his mulling. Composing himself and removing the maps to their drawers he yelled, "Diz better be gud!" at the door. "Dat be no way to talk to ya friends" came the reply. Bagulan smiled then put the permanent scowl back in place. "Juzta minut and I open da door" he said. Bagulan quickly put on the Dark Forge Tunic that was hanging on the wall, lifted the bar across the door and opened it so hard that it slammed against the back wall with a bang.<br />
Azlana peered inside and stepped in. "M'here fer dis days lessons" she said.<br />
Outside a watcher stood unseen taking notes.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere...<br />
<br />
They gathered below the nest. Four unlikely companions united against a common foe. Jediit hummed a song to himself as Liam and Brega discussed the merits of a sage from the northlands known only as Getty Lee. Mindayin sat alone a part of this fellowship yet still alone in his beliefs and fundamentals. He looked up as Jediit bellowed a challenge to the Aviak guard. The Guard dropped from his perch and began chasing him back to the group. Liam and Brega entered the fray. Mindayin looked at his undead servant, and then nodded a silent command to the minion.<br />
<br />
Feathers flew as the group tore into Aviak after Aviak, the last one falling as the sun set. Jediit recanted the tale of the arrival of the lost order in a land known as Britannia as they rested. Off behind the rocks a small figure scurried away muttering to itself....</div>
