<h2>The Black Fortress Part 3</h2>
<div class="tale">
	<h5>By: Santiago</h5>
	<div class="text">
		The Keg and Anchor<br />
by Santiago<br />
<br />
If ever there was a place that exemplified the current decadence of Trinsic, it was the Keg and Anchor tavern. The old building stood at the heart of the city -- and, like a heart, it pumped out and pulled back to itself all the sinful elements that had come to infest the town. If you wanted to have someone killed, you came to the tavern. If you wanted to indulge any sort of pleasure imaginable, you came to the tavern. Alcohol, women and gambling -- these were the three main avenues of commerce, and the tavern profited very well from each of them.<br />
<br />
Like some sort of undead creature, the tavern only came alive at night. Through its doors passed all the people who had long ago discarded any sort of conscience or morality they might once have had (for after all, such clothes are heavy, no?). Thieves, assassins, mercenaries, prostitutes, pirates, government officials -- all the filth and scum of society would congregate here nearly every night, to bask in the unbridled ecstasies that only sin can offer.<br />
<br />
That's assuming, of course, that you had money. Gold was the only requirement, the only admittance pass necessary. As long as you had coins in your pocket, you were more than welcome at the Keg and Anchor. You might not hold on to your money for very long, though. Whether it was an unlucky throw of the dice, the unnoticed snip of a cutpurse's knife, or a night spent in the embrace of a pretty young woman -- the morning has a way of finding you penniless and alone.<br />
<br />
The honest citizens of Trinsic tried to ignore the place, for the most part. They regarded it as a pestilent wound, but one that only opened and bled at night. By day it was quiet and harmless, so they passed it by, and simply hoped that the wound would one day heal and be gone. Besides, no one dared to confront the atrocity. Oh, they knew it was wrong, allowing Vice to lair within the walls of their own city. But who would cast the first stone? The merchant, who struggled for so long to afford a home for his wife and family -- would he now put them in mortal danger? The blacksmith's wife, who cries to herself at night because she still loves her husband, even though she knows that he is unfaithful to her -- does she step forward and perhaps shatter what's left of her fragile marriage? No. It's much easier to keep quiet, and hold on to the life you have. Fear is the ally of Vice, and to declare war against it takes more bravery than most people possess. It's simply too much to expect of one man to stand alone against the darkness.<br />
 <br />
Santiago stood alone in the darkness. Raindrops tapped a muted staccato rhythm on the brim of his old, floppy hat. From under that brim, two dark brown eyes peered across the street at the Keg and Anchor tavern, where two armed men stood guard at its entrance. The soldiers paced and shifted about, obviously less than thrilled to have pulled guard duty on a cold and rainy night. Santiago watched them as if they were mice -- for tonight, he was the cat whose claws were about to appear.<br />
<br />
The guardsmen saw only a pathetic beggar approaching them -- a common sight in Trinsic these days. "Spare some gold?" cried the feeble creature in its usual greeting.<br />
<br />
"Shove off," growled one soldier.<br />
<br />
The beggar drew closer. "A few coins is all I ask!"<br />
<br />
"Aye? Well, a sword in the belly is all you'll get from us," said the soldier. "Now get out of here!"<br />
<br />
The beggar turned as if to go, but then whirled around with his gnarled staff and whacked the soldier in the head as hard as he could. There was a loud 'thunk', and the warrior collapsed to the ground like a sack of flour. His companion was taken completely by surprise, and struggled to free his own blade. Before he could do so, Santiago leaped forward and administered another painful dose of head-banging. In the space of a few seconds, it was all over.<br />
<br />
Santiago didn't bother to hide the bodies. He simply took off his hat and tossed it to the ground. Beneath the old beggar's robe, which he pulled over his head and discarded, he wore his traditional Fleet outfit of blue and white, adorned only with a single silver clasp in the shape of a lion -- the insignia of the Lost Order of Akalabeth. He had not worn the uniform in a long time, but he felt that it was fitting to wear it now, on this -- possibly the last night of his life.<br />
The gnarled staff clattered to the ground, and Santiago drew out his old sword -- the same blade that he had carried in the days when he used to sail with Joxer, <br />
<br />
Greyhawk, Enosh, Tara, Keeshi -- a legendary host of noble seafarers whom he was proud to call friends. And though many of them had long ago set sail for distant lands, and though the glorious circle they had once formed was but a sunny memory, somehow he hoped that their phantoms lingered here still, watching over him through dark perils such as the one he now faced.<br />
<br />
As he tested the weight of the weapon in his gloved hands, he could almost see their faces once again. How he wished that they were here, now -- that they could march together through those doors and fight side-by-side, as they once used to. But he knew that it would be only his sword tonight, alone against a sea of foes. He silently prayed that the old blade would see him through one more battle.<br />
<br />
So it was, clad in clothes and thoughts of the past, that he entered the Keg and Anchor tavern.
