	<h4>Captain's Log: To Kidnap a Wench</h4>
	<h5>By: Santiago</h5>
	<br>
	<div class="text">Captain's Log: To Kidnap A Wench<br />
by Santiago<br />
<br />
Saturday, the fifteenth o' January, in the Year of our Lard, 2000...<br />
<br />
Well, I weren't altogether ship-shape yet, but the abbey was startin' to make me itch. Four walls is too many fer the likes o' me. No sword-fightin', no dancin' girls, no bawdy pirate songs – I tell ye, it's a wonder anybody goes to church at all!<br />
<br />
So I snuk out this mornin', an' made me way to the ol' Village, to see if thar weren't some mischief or other that I could get meself into. I met a bloke thar who fancied 'imself a dragon tamer. Har! Any fella's what got more than two coins worth o' sense in his noggin oughtter know that thar's some things that just can't be tamed – namely, wenches an' dragons. Both is full o' fire, an' the good Lard have mercy 'pon ye if ye get on their bad side! It put me in mind o' the time I weighed anchor at Buccaneer's Den, an' met one o' them so-called 'dragon tamers' in the blacksmith shop. Well, turns out that big ol' lizard din't want a master no more, so it started breathin' fire on ev'rybody 'til they was nothin' more than little itty-bitty piles o' black barbecue on the floor. I was the only one what got out o' that place together with me life, an' I'll be darned if ever I go within ten paces of a lizard what's bigger than I am.<br />
<br />
But anyways, it turns out this fella was havin' some stormy words with a lady. She told him what he could go an' do with 'imself, an' he went off to do it, I s'pose. The lady looked all upset, an' ran off toward a cottage nearby. Mind ye, mateys...'tween dragons an' wenches, I won't give ye more than one guess as to which one be harder to tame!<br />
<br />
So I rolls up me sleeves an' says, "This here looks like a job fer Santiago!" But it's easier when ye got help, so I called upon one o' the knights that was thar – Sir Dothas, by name. The two of us marched right into that cottage with the singular plan to put a smile on the face o' that young, perty lady.<br />
<br />
We started off by askin' her if she wanted the other fella dead. She looked at us as if we was crazy or somethin' (lots o' folks look at me that way, so I come to expect it). She says we can't just go off killin' people. I says, why not? If ye don't like someone, just get rid of 'em! Makes life easier, it does. But she don't want us to kill 'im (darn'd if I know why). So thar's only one thing I can think of that'll make her happy. Time fer a little kidnappin'!<br />
<br />
B'fore ye can say "pumpernickel", Dothas grabs her an' slings her over his back. I says, "Now, milady, I hope ye don't mind it if we kidnap ye fer a bit." An' she says, "Oh, all right." Odd's fish! Wouldn't ye expect more of a fight? With most o' the ladies I run into, I'll be hanged if it don't seem like they WANT to be kidnapped...! Ain't that a strangeness?<br />
<br />
But I ain't complainin', 'cause ye can't complain much when yer about to make out...errr, I mean, make off with a good-lookin' woman on yer pirate ship. But then Dothas asks if we can find a wench fer him as well. Well, why not? Figger the Abbey is a good place to look fer wenches. I tell 'im, wait outside...I'll be back in a jiffy (figger it won't take too long...'cause who can resist a pirate in uniform, eh?).<br />
<br />
So I wander inside, an' lay eyes upon Lady Starnite, from the Clan Moor. Ye should o' heard how clever I was...I asked her if she wouldn't mind joinin' me on a sea voyage, to make sure that me shipmate – Dothas the ornery (aye, I used just that very word!) – didn't get out o' hand or nothin'. I call it wondrous luck that the good Lard din't strike me down with lightnin' right then an' thar, seein' how far from the truth I was. But alas! Turns out the lady was on her way to a meetin' with the Town Council o' Yew. Well, heck...how can ye go to some bloody boring meeting, when ye could be out on the High Seas! But she just smiled at me an' promised that she would go with me some other day. An' darned if that smile din't make me give way, like I was some sort o' bloody romantic. But one look from them bright blue eyes, an' me brain just plain went to mush.<br />
<br />
Well, not long after she left, I caught sight of Lady Rhiannon! An' darned if she weren't dressed to put a fella's eyes on fire, what with her tight leather armor an' all. So I put the question out again...would she set sail with the unwashed? But no, she's busy doin' somethin' else – but she'll be back later this evenin', 'round seven o'clock. Now mind...fer those of ye who think kidnappin' ladies is easy – well, yer a hundred an' eighty degrees off course. All these meetin's, an' appointments, an' schedules; it's gettin' to the point whar ye almost have to arrange it b'forehand!<br />
<br />
Anyways, we figgered that one wench is better than none. So we brought the one wench on board an' hoisted the sails. B'fore ye knew it, we was out on the High Seas, drinkin' an' laughin'. Dothas an' Connie (aye, turns out that was her name), they was foolin' around at the prow, utterin' some nonsense 'bout bein' "the King o' the Warld", to which Connie said, "Look, I'm flyin'!" Oh, they was bustin' a gut, to be sure. I told Connie that when we got to the South Seas, she'd have to dress more like a pirate lady – that fancy dress o' hers just wouldn't do! So I handed her a skimpy outfit, which she looked at an' said, "Whar's the rest of it?" When I told her that was all of it, she just smiled an' said, "We'll see."<br />
<br />
It weren't long b'fore the sun set, an' I brought out the lanterns while we ate fish pie an' drank apple cider. Dothas played some music (if ye can call it music...me, it was all I could do not to throw meself overboard an' end it all) while I did a bit of fishin'. Turns out Dothas had to go, though, so with a few magic words an' a puff o' smoke, he was gone.<br />
<br />
Then it was just me an' Connie. So I start walkin' toward her an' I says, "Well, milady, just the two of us now...what would ye like to do?" An' she smiles at me an' says, "Maybe ye would like me to put on this here 'pirate lady outfit', eh?" So I says, "Indeed I would, milady!" An' she says, "I s'pose ye want to kiss these soft lips, eh?" So I says, "I wouldn't mind it none too much, milady!" An' she moves right up to me, an' I put me arms 'round her, an' then...an' then...<br />
Well, I woke up the next mornin' lyin' on the deck with a bruise on me head. Thar was no one else about...the deck were empty, save for some scanty lady clothes, which I stashed away in the ship's hold, fer use the next time I found meself with a good-lookin' lass on board.</div>
