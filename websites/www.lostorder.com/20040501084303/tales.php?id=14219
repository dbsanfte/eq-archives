	<h4>Andryvhar's Adventures</h4>
	<h5>By: Andryvhar</h5>
	<br>
	<div class="text">Andryvhar's Adventures<br />
by Andryvhar<br />
<br />
It was a cool night in the hills and mountains outside of Ak'anon. Andryvhar had just left the city proper and was standing at the entrance. Watchmen Prynn and Prenn stood at the ready, prepared to defend the fair city with their lives if need be. That usually wasn't a problem, for Prynn and Prenn were extremely powerful, and able to handle most situations singularly. When the two of them were together, they were almost undefeatable. Andryvhar shivered a bit. He wished he still had his gold robe that he received from the Enchanter's Guild. Only recently had he removed it in favor of the stronger, sturdier, albeit colder clothing that he had bought. It had taken him weeks of hard fighting to earn the gold for that clothing, and though it offered very little protection, it was more shielding than the robe.<br />
<br />
Being an enchanter, he shunned armor, of course. The confines of plate mail, chain mail, or even leather hindered movement too much to be conducive to spell casting. So, he wore only the clothing he purchased. In the outfit, he looked like a bum, he thought. However, it would provide the protection he needed.<br />
<br />
He wasn't fond of being out here in the cold. He would much rather be in the city, standing on the dock, casting his line in, and enjoying a relaxing day of fishing. However, his hunger for both knowledge, and power drove him to the outskirts of the city more and more every day. He had always dreamed of adventure, and now he was, sort of, living the life he had dreamed of.<br />
Shaking all thoughts from his head, he stepped out onto the path that led into the towering mountains. He was out here today to test a new spell he had just purchased. Juli's Animation. This spell would animate a sword and shield to fight alongside the caster. Just what he needed, Andryvhar thought. He was tired of receiving the bumps and bruises associated with battle.<br />
<br />
When he came to the fork in the path, where Watchman Dreeb stood, he stopped. He then began the incantation for the shielding spell. He always made sure to wear this spell outside of the city, and it had proved invaluable. After he felt the green glow surround him, he began casting the strength spell he knew. This spell was helpful for those times Andryvhar had to soil his staff in melee combat.<br />
<br />
Once this was completed, he began the casting of Juli's Animation. As the air crackled around him, nothing happened.<br />
The spell fizzled out just as quickly as it had begun.<br />
"Drat!" shouted Andryvhar.<br />
"What's that, Sir?" asked Watchman Dreeb.<br />
"Oh!" Andryvhar chuckled. "I didn't realize ye could hear me. My apologies my friend," he continued.<br />
Think nothing of it," Dreeb said. Andryvhar wasn't sure, but he could almost see Dreeb smile through that plate mail helmet he was wearing.<br />
<br />
Andryvhar turned and frowned. He was prone to those kinds of lapses when he would cast spells. His guildmaster had always told him that concentration was the most important ingredient. Andryvhar knew he must concentrate. He checked his pack, and saw the 2 tiny daggers that were required for this particular spell. Then, he started the incantation.<br />
<br />
As the sparks of magical energy swirled around him, Andryvhar fought to keep his concentration on the spell. The green glow was so bright, he was blinded by it, but when the smoke cleared, and the spell was complete, before him floated a sword and a shield. The being that held that equipment was invisible. Andryvhar stood in awe.<br />
<br />
This was the first thing he had summoned. He summoned it! Gods! His guildmaster would be so proud. However, he needed to get back to the task at hand. There was a kobold camp a short distance through the valley, and he was determined to rid the area of the filthy beasts. This summoned creature was brought forth to help him in his task.<br />
<br />
He dubbed the creature Lonarn, and ordered it to guard him. He made sure he had enough food and drink to last for the trip. He also thought about what spells he would need memorized for the battle. He decided on Mesmerize, which would hold the beasties in place, suffocating sphere to damage and choke them, and weaken to drain their strength. When that was done, he and Lonarn set out resolutely for the kobold camp.<br />
<br />
It was just a short walk, and as he approached, he could see them. Three kobolds. There were two tents put up around a fire, and there was one kobold in each tent. The third was warming itself by the fire. Andryvhar couldn't blame it, for the air had gotten considerably colder since he had left Ak'anon. He shivered, and pulled his cloak around him.<br />
<br />
He began to consider how to handle the kobolds. Two of them, it seemed, were weaker than Andryvhar, but the third looked just as strong, if not stronger than the enchanter. He decided that he would cast mesmerize on that one, and let the other two come to him when they saw the magic holding their friend.<br />
Almost as if he sensed Andryvhar was ready to act, Lonarn nudged his attention to the ridge on the left. Standing there was a fourth kobold, obviously placed there as a lookout. Andryvhar sighed and thanked Brell Sirilis that he had been blessed with such a watchful guardian.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the kobold had strayed far enough away that Andryvhar could hit it with a spell without the others noticing. Hoping that the kobold would come to fight, and not flee back to the camp, Andryvhar began reciting the Suffocating Sphere spell. As the blast left his hands, he saw it strike the kobold. Just as he had hoped, the kobold came barreling off of the ridge right at Andryvhar.<br />
His first instinct was to run, but where was the fun in that? Right before the kobold reached him, Lonarn stepped in front of Andryvhar, and delivered a most vicious slash to the kobold, cleanly removing the beasts ear. The kobold roared in pain, and directed its attention to the summoned creature. Andryvhar stepped around Lonarn, and cast the Suffocating Sphere spell again. Again it struck the kobold and the creature began to choke. That was sufficient to cause the beast to turn tail, and try to run, but Lonarn cut him down in mid stride. The kobold was dead.<br />
<br />
Andryvhar's heart was racing as he stared in awe at the powerful summoned ally he had. He felt almost invincible with Lonarn under his control. He smiled broadly, turning his attention to the dead kobold. As he searched through the remains, he found some silver and copper coins, and a bronze amulet, which he was certain would sell for quite a bit.<br />
<br />
He was half tempted to go home, and leave the other kobolds there. However, the lure of treasure pulled his attention, and he decided to give an attempt to slay them as well. He was also curious, and wanted to see Lonarn in battle again. He stepped to the side of the ridge, cast his shielding and strengthen spells again, and then cast the strength spell on Lonarn. That, he thought, will make him even stronger. He smiled at his logic.<br />
<br />
He decided to follow through with his original plan, and cast mesmerize on the first kobold. Luckily, they were all in the same spots. Andryvhar began the casting.<br />
<br />
He saw the kobold by the fire freeze as the spell took effect. Then he saw the other two kobolds rushing towards him. The rain began falling as they neared, and he chose one and began casting his Suffocating Sphere spell, it hit the one kobold, knocking it back and choking it. The other one was battling with Lonarn, as Andryvhar stepped in and bashed the creature with his staff. He had expended all of his mana, and was no longer afforded the luxury of spells. It would be physical battle from here on out.<br />
<br />
The rain made it even colder than before, and Andryvhar longed for a mug of warm cider. He had more pressing issues at hand, however. He knew they must work quickly, as the third kobold wouldn't stay held too long. The one who had been choked was already back in the foray, as Andryvhar and Lonarn both concentrated on one foe. Lonarn was taking the brunt of the blows, and quietly, Andryvhar marveled at how much punishment the invisible being was taking.<br />
As Andryvhar swung his staff around once more, it met the kobolds skull with a satisfying crunch. The kobold howled loudly, and then fell dead to the ground. Seeing his friend dead, the other kobold swiped Andryvhar with his claws, tearing his shirt.<br />
<br />
"My shirt!" cried Andryvhar, who could think of nothing more than how much he had paid for it. "Do you know how much this cost me?!?" he shouted at the kobold, who didn't understand a word of it. Lonarn, however seemed to stare in shock at the little, shouting gnome.<br />
<br />
Andryvhar was extremely upset over his shirt. So upset in fact, that he was oblivious to the blood dripping from the open wound. He bashed the kobold repeatedly, in succession until the beast was dead.<br />
Andryvhar had barely let out his breath, and the third one was upon him, kicking and biting, and scratching Andryvhar. Lonarn cut at the beast, drawing his attention, as Andryvhar lie on the ground in immense pain. This didn't quite match his dreams of adventure. Weren't adventures clean cut, handsome men at a table in a tavern, enjoying drinks on the house, with a maiden on each arm? While Andryvhar pondered this, the kobold and Lonarn, already weak from the previous battles, were swiping at each other.<br />
<br />
Andryvhar recovered, and saw the kobold getting the best of his summoned friend. He began feeling the inner parts of his mind, and decided he had enough mana for one more spell. He began reciting the suffocating sphere spell, and just before it hit, the kobold landed the finishing blow on Lonarn.<br />
"No!" screamed Andryvhar. The kobold turned to face him just as the spell took hold. Andryvhar saw the snarled hatred in the kobolds face as he began to choke. The beast fell to the ground, dead, and Andryvhar collapsed.<br />
<br />
He lay on the ground for quite some time, before he realized he must hurry. It wouldn't be long before more kobolds were about, and he was no match for them in his current condition. He quickly searched the others finding many silver and copper pieces, as well as a mug of ale, and a bottle of mead. It seems the little beasts have a taste for alcohol.<br />
Afterwards, Andryvhar looked at where Lonarn had died. There was nothing there, and though he was sad that the summoned creature had departed, he knew he couldn't hold it forever.<br />
<br />
As he headed for home, he decided he would stop at a merchants tent in Ak'anon, and sell the few trinkets he had recovered. He would keep the mead for himself, run to the bank, and deposit his money. Then, he'd grab his fishing pole and bait, go to his favorite dock, and drink and fish until he passed out.</div>
