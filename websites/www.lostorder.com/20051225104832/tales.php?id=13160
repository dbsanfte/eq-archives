<h2>Missive from the Coast</h2>
<div class="tale">
	<h5>By: Solf</h5>
	<div class="text">
		Missive From The Coast<br />
By The Solf<br />
<br />
Greeting, I hope you all receive this note in good health.<br />
<br />
Here is my tale,<br />
<br />
I found myself away from town for a full day, the hunting was quite good. There were sharks, and their big brothers the Lurkers a plenty, as well as Gromnies and golems. As the day wore on into dusk, I wandered down the coastline, as I am apt to do. Hunting the whole way, I was soon lost in my thoughts. The coast is quite long north of Hebian-To, and wound around to the northeast. I wandered into an occasional Banderling camp, and even a pack of Hunter Shreths. For some reason, I pressed onward, knowing inwardly that I should have called it a day and returned to my temporary home in Hebian.<br />
<br />
Something, however, pulled me onward. Almost like a calling, there was something out there. Eventually, the hunt went sour, and there was no creature to be found on the coast, except for the occasional lost Drudge. Then, as I rounded the base of a mountain, facing almost East now down the coast, I saw it. There, in the distance, was a tower.<br />
<br />
What a strange sight it was, too. Like nothing I had ever seen in the Sho, Aluvian, or my Gharu'ndim home. A new architecture entirely. The structure looked like an alien cancer extending from the Derethian soil. There was a soft hum I could here, even from this great distance, and the top of the tower spewed a smoke like substance into the sky. Once again, I felt drawn to this tower, and my legs seemed to move of their own volition. I walked closer.<br />
<br />
Soon, enough, I had traversed the distance, and was at the base of the tower. The soft hum I had heard earlier was now a fair rumble, and I could feel the vibrations in the ground. The structure itself was composed of what seemed to me to be normal building materials... a brick of some sort. The craftsmanship, however, was like nothing I had ever seen. The bricks were fastened so tightly, they were practically seamless. The wall felt like glass, smooth and cold. Though there was snow on the ground, and the temperature had dropped significantly in the past few weeks, this felt unnaturally cold to the touch. Rounding the base of the tower, I found a path that led upward, wrapping around the tower. Once again I was pulled onward.<br />
<br />
The tower seemed twice as high as it looked from a distance. The wind howled around me as I ascended, and the rumbling I felt on the ground grew steadily louder. The path was as smooth and as cold as the walls, but even so I did not slip. I put my divining staff away, feeling that I would not need to call upon my mystical energies... or maybe I inwardly knew that any effort would be futile against the creators of this tower. Finally, after what seemed a physically impossible climb; I finally stood at the top of this fantastic structure.<br />
<br />
I was amazed at what I saw, a mystical smoke was pouring from the top of this tower, filling the Derethian sky. The roar here was almost unbearable. As I drew closer, I discovered that this smoke had no discernible properties. It gave off no heat, as if it were produced by a fire, and it gave off no cold, as if it were the steam from a giant block of ice. It simply was. There was the smoke and the noise, for what purpose I had no idea. I tried my best to analyze what I could of this phenomenon, to no avail. The only thing I was fairly sure of after hours of studying, was that this had no benign purpose. There were sinister forces at work here.<br />
<br />
Feeling unsatisfied with my findings, I finally pulled myself away from this spectacle, and began my descent. As I started down, however, I stopped... something was wrong... different... I put my hand out, and it went right through the wall in front of me.<br />
<br />
What I had found, here, was a secret room of some sort. I stepped in, and found the most amazing sights yet. Through the center of the room, and what seemed to run through the center of the tower, was a pillar of some sort. The 'smoke' from the top of the tower, apparently emanated from this pillar... and it radiated with a power source of some kind. The walls and ceiling of this room were adorned with writing, an alien script of some sort. The whole room felt like an ancient tomb. In a strange way, it felt as if no one had been in this room for a very long time, and at the same time I could feel a presence. Almost like someone was watching me. Perhaps it was just evil emanating through the walls themselves. I studied the room for a bit, and took the time to make a few notes, from which I write this missive.<br />
<br />
I then left the tower, descended and walked away, not even turning back. As strong as the force that brought me here was, my resolve to leave this foul place was stronger now. I wanted to out of the eyes of this tower as soon as possible... though I felt that I would be back, under less 'calm' circumstances. I made my way back to Hebian-To, and sat to write you all of my findings. Take from my tale what you will, and if you find an interest in these findings, you know how to reach me. However, even if you choose to ignore this bizarre occurrence, be warned, something unnatural is occurring in our fair land. Keep your backs to the wall and your eyes to the horizon, I feel a great evil coming.<br />
<br />
I remain,<br />
The Solf
