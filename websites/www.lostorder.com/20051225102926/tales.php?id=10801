		<b>Drifting</b><br />
By <i>Tasslehof</i><br />
<br />
     Tasslehof sat on the steps of the House of the Architects this night, listening to the crickets singing their rowdy song and the wind gently whispering through the massive Yew trees on the outskirts of the village. Looking up he stared at the stars that shone so brightly in the deep darkness that was the sky in these parts and started to remember other nights when he had seen that sky and listened to those sounds. He had been on this world a very long time from the coming of the Order back to the lands of Britannia to now...oh so many years later and as he sat his mind started to slowly drift back to the beginning...<br />
<br />
     He remembered the first day of their return to the lands...he had awoke cold and hungry and lacking all of the many skills he had once had, but at least he had arrived in Vesper where he was supposed to meet the rest of those returning. He picked himself up off the ground and headed for the nearest Inn, as that was the most likely point to meet Brimstone and Freejack and the rest of his brethren.<br />
<br />
     On his way he started to notice how fresh and new everything smelled even though it looked as if these people and these buildings had been here for quite some time.  The grass was a deep shade of emerald green and smelled as if a light spring rain had just fallen, making it seem as if Mother Nature herself walked the land beside him. There, coming up in the distance, was the Inn with its trademark torches dancing merrily in the breeze and the sound of laughter and tall tales drifting out of its open door.<br />
<br />
     Tass walked into the Inn and several people looked up and then looked again in confusion, for what they saw at first was a fresh-faced farmboy. Until they looked at the eyes. Eyes a deep forest green that seemed as if they carried the wisdom of the Ages. Two pairs of eyes though did not look surprised but rather pleased for though they were of a different color yet they carried the same air of experience. Tasslehof saw them in the back of the room but a moment after they had spotted him and recognition dawned upon him at the same time as a small impish grin. He made his way back to the corner where they sat and greeted them.<br />
<br />
"Hail Brothers. Damn tis good to see a familiar face in here, Brewman, and you as well Ghoti. Any word from the others yet?"<br />
<br />
     Brewman gave a slight negative shake of his head while Ghoti replied " Nay not yet, though we expect them any moment. To be honest we have not been sure who made it through the crossover and who didn't, but if someone had not made it then I think we would have felt their demise. I do know that not everyone made it here to Britannia but they have not passed on. I rather think that they might have crossed into some other world." <br />
"They have," Brewman said...and would say no more. "Brew...old friend...you have REALLY got to talk a little more...we are going to need to communicate here if we are to return ourselves to our former state" Ghoti snorted.<br />
<br />
"While we wait for Brimstone and Freejack perhaps you and I should go out and see how the land lies Ghoti," Tasslehof said." Brew here would be the best one to wait for them as I really don't want a repeat of the Last Inn I was in, although that WAS rather fun." <br />
<br />
"OH NO, I QUITE agree with that Tass, you barely escaped alive the last time you spent any time in a place with people. And we had one Devil of a tab to pay in damages. Not too mention the healer bill for you." Ghoti snorted.  <br />
<br />
Tasslehof replied, "Whoa hang on there. It was NOT my fault that fellow couldn't take a little joke. And I have no idea whatsoever how that Blade Spirit got loose or where are those blasted ruffians came from. That whole mess was not my fault how was I to know he was the local warlord?"<br />
<br />
"All the same," Ghoti said, " you are going to stick with me for a while. I really don't think you are in any shape yet to be running off on your own. Or have you not noticed that we no longer carry the power and skills we once had?"<br />
<br />
"Aye I noticed," was Tasslehof's reply. "Maybe we can find someone to retrain us or perhaps gather some gossip in the local merchants quarters." <br />
<br />
"I will wait here," Brewman quietly stated. <br />
<br />
"Great! We are all settled then. Come on Ghoti, lets go see the sights, " Tass grinned.<br />
<br />
     Ghoti and Tasslehof took their leave of Brewman and started for the door. Ghoti was very much relieved that he was getting Tass the heck out of there without having to fight his way out. He always did prefer to talk his way out of a place whenever he could, but Tass had trouble with a capital T follow him everywhere he went. On the good side of that though it definitely kept him on his toes.<br />
<br />
     Tass and Ghoti walked around the corner of the Inn on their way to the merchant quarter where they hoped to purchase a few weapons and some magical implements in preparation for the long arduous journey back to power ahead of them. They passed a shadow at the back of the Inn when a strong pair of hands grabbed Tass and yanked him into the shadows. A second pair of hands holding a bow pulled Ghoti into the same area and the shadowy figures quickly placed a hand over Tass' mouth. <br />
<br />
"Quiet," hissed a low voice.  "Ghoti how many did he get after you this time? And where are the rest of the Council?" the other voice quietly asked. <br />
<br />
"He didn't have time for his curse to work this time" Ghoti replied and asked " Carnifex is that you?" <br />
<br />
"Aye and Ralineth with me," Carnifex sighed. " I had thought for sure we were doomed to be chased to the four corners before we even got everyone together." <br />
<br />
"Brewman is at the Inn, " said Tass. "He is as quiet here as he was back in the last realm. We haven't found Brimstone and Freejack, though I am sure the Shard and the Tome are protecting them. No word or sign from Avenger or Zari yet either."<br />
<br />
"Ok", said Ralineth, " I will go stay with Brew while the three of you scout the city and look for the rest of the group. It will take at least two of us to keep Tass here from bringing down some type of trouble on us."<br />
<br />
     Ralineth walked quietly back toward the front of the Inn while Carnifex fell into place on the other side of Tasslehof. Once again they started on their way to scout out the rhythms of this new city. <br />
<br />
     Tasslehof perked up when they passed a shop with the distinctive smell of hot metal being forged and a house adjoining it that carried the sounds of combatants practicing their war skills. "Hey you two, we DO need to start building our fighting skills again and gain some sort of protection. Why don't we visit the Smith's shop and then go over for a little practice on the dummies??" Tass said with a smile. <br />
<br />
 "Oh no you don't," Carnifex replied. "We don't do any of that until we find the people we are missing and sniff out a little more knowledge about how the land lies."<br />
<br />
"Agreed," said Ghoti, " that must be our first priority."<br />
<br />
"Hmmm" Carnifex muttered. " I would almost bet that we can find Brimstone in the nearest Tailor shop getting outfitted with something a little more decent to look at than these rags we all appeared here in. Why don't we go there first and look for him and if we see a bowyer along the way we can stop there to look for Freejack.  Zari will most likely head for the nearest mage shop to look for reagents and any magical items she may need so we need to keep our eyes peeled for her as well." <br />
<br />
"And Tass," Carnifex growled. "This time you are NOT going in the mage shops. Let me know what you need and I will try to find it. I don't want you getting fried by a fireball or something before we have even been here a day."<br />
"Carnifex I TOLD you that little mishap was not my fault, I DID NOT make those ogre mages attack the place. It happened all on its own and you know it." <br />
<br />
"Yeah but considering that there had not been an ogre mage even seen within a thousand MILES of the place until you walked in, I don't think that they believed that." said Ghoti with a raised eyebrow. <br />
<br />
"It was still not my fault" Tass explained.<br />
<br />
Ghoti and Carnifex just looked at each other and sighed. Tasslehof could bring down a flood in a desert.<br />
<br />
     Carnifex, Tasslehof, and Ghoti proceeded to make their way to the nearest Tailor shop, stopping here and there to ask directions and to listen to the rumors and gossip that always float around the streets of a town the size of Vesper. When they finally arrived, Carnifex and Ghoti almost ran Tasslehof over as just inside the door he fell to the floor and started laughing uncontrollably. <br />
<br />
"What in the world is so funny?" Ghoti asked. <br />
<br />
     Tasslehof could merely point and continue laughing at the frowning object of his laughter. Carnifex and Ghoti looked over to the place Tasslehof was pointing and saw Brimstone wearing a tall garish blue hat with a buckle on its front, a long and flowing sky-blue cape, and thigh-high black leathern boots to complete the ensemble.<br />
<br />
     When Tasslehof could stop laughing long enough he said, "Brimstone...that is the FUNNIEST hat I have EVER SEEN. I don't know...maybe it is just I am so used to seeing you in those serious robes of yours with the long serious beard and all."  "Although," Tass said thoughtfully, " you WERE able to keep a meal or two in that beard of yours just from the crumbs you dropped in it during a meal." Tasslehof then once again fell to the floor laughing like there were no tomorrow.<br />
<br />
"Greetings everyone. I see Tass made the journey over without losing any of his charming "humor", " Brimstone sighed. "Any word on the rest of the group?" he asked Carnifex. <br />
<br />
"Brewman and Ralineth are waiting at the Inn for us and we were about to go looking for Zari, Freejack, and Avenger after we stopped here." was Carnifex's reply. <br />
<br />
"No need on two of those counts", said a soft, silky voice behind them. <br />
<br />
The group turned to see Zari and Avenger standing behind them with slight grins on their faces. "I don't see the town burning down or a massive army of murderers or monsters attacking yet so I assume Tass has not been here long," grinned Avenger. <br />
<br />
"Don't give him any ideas Avenger," said a strong voice from the doorway. "It is bad enough trouble follows him around without you helping it along" said the weathered voice of Freejack.<br />
<br />
"I can agree with that mate," grinned Ralineth, entering the shop with Brewman on his right. "Freejack found us at the Inn just a short while after you three left" said Ralineth. "Se we decided to come looking for you." <br />
<br />
"It is so good to have us all together again," Tass said with a huge grin on his face. "Now we can start having some FUN!!"<br />
<br />
     Everyone in the group sighed and looked at each other, wondering who was going to keep Tass out of trouble till they could get established again. None of them really wanted that particular job...though they would do anything for him, as they knew he would for them. Indeed, to be fair, Tass had bailed each of them out of dire straits on several occasions.<br />
<br />
"So be it then," Brimstone stated. "Everyone gather what they will need and meet back at the Inn. That will be our headquarters for now. Once you have those things you require meet me there and we will begin our quest of bringing light back to this land." <br />
<br />
"It is time brothers and sisters," Brimstones voice vibrated their very bones as it gained a ringing tone of power and majesty, "It is time once more for the Lost Order of Akalabeth to walk the lands of Britannia. And WOE to those of evil intent that stand in our way."<br />
<br />
Drifting.... drifting....<br />
<br />
     Tasslehof slowly brought himself back from the reverie of the past to see the sun starting to come up over the trees and the birds singing softly in the distance. While guardians started their patrols and the merchants chatted with their vendors about the days business Tasslehof noticed the aches and pains that came with his long years upon the realm and he raised his now-silver-maned head to look around and see how far they had come in their quest to return to what they once were in this realm long, long ago.<br />
<br />
And he was Proud.
