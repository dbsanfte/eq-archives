    <h3 align="left" class="style7">Scout Heroic Opportunity Tutorial - Updated 11/11 </h3>
    <p align="left" class="style7"><span class="feature style3"><span class="feature "><img src="scoutbar.gif" width="39" height="234"></span></span></p>
    <h3 class="feature style3">Heroic opportunity skills:</h3>
    <p class="feature ">Almost every skill or spell that you get can be used to advance a heroic opportunity. If you right click on a skill or spell icon a list will come up. Choose examine from the menu and you will see a description of the skill or spell. You will also see a green icon showing you what heroic opportunity icon it is associated with. For scouts, there are three that we will be focusing on. We will also be focusing on your heroic opportunities that you can complete by yourself. These we call solo heroic opportunities. </p>
    <p class="feature ">For this tutorial, we will assume that you have reached level 5. Level 5 is when you will get your heroic opportunity skill named Lucky Break. This skill has no casting time, it takes no mana to cast, and has a 10 second reuse timer. </p>
    <p class="feature ">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="feature  style3"><strong>Identifying icons:</strong></p>
    <p class="feature ">All scout heroic opportunity skills are colored green. Fighters are blue, mages are red, and priests are gold. There are six icons for each archetype. The icons for scouts are: Coin, Dagger, Mask, Bow, Lock, and Cloak. </p>
    <span class="style3 feature"><strong>Starting your first heroic opportunity (The Starter Chain): </strong></span>
    <p class="feature ">To begin your heroic opportunity use a combat skill, spell, or use auto attack to begin combat with a creature. Next, press your Lucky Break hotkey that should be located in your bar at the bottom of your screen. You will see what is called a starter chain appear in the lower right hand corner of your screen with a lock icon in the center. There are several other icons circling the lock such as a blue horn, blue boot, green coin and a gold chalice. The only green icon is the coin, so you will need to use a skill that has a coin icon. Evade is the first skill that you will recieve that has a coin icon associated with it. So, while targeting the creature, press your evade skill. You will notice that the picture in the lower right hand corner has changed. It is now displaying what heroic opportunity you have started. <span class="style17">Special Note: </span>Using a skill or spell that is not listed in the starter chain will cause the heroic opportunity to fail and you will have to start it over again. But, once you have the HO wheel up, you can use any skill or spell and it will not hurt the heroic opportunity.</p>
    <h3 class="feature  style3">Ordered and unordered heroic opportunities: </h3>
    <p class="feature"><span class="feature  style3"><img src="unordered.gif" width="41" height="45"><img src="ordered.gif" width="43" height="51"></span>Heroic opportunities are either ordered or unordered. If a HO is ordered, then the icons in the HO wheel must be done in the order that they are shown. If it is unordered, then it does not matter when you use your skill or spell. There are also three colors that the two icons can display. Yellow is for a heroic opportunity that is currently inprogress. Green is for a completed HO. And red is for a failed HO. This final color can display if you let the timer run out before making the next step in the HO. The timer is displayed as a blue circle around the HO. <span class="style17">Note: </span>In the examples on the left, the first icon is unordered and the second is ordered. </p>
    <h3 class="feature style3"><strong>Heroic opportunity possibilities and &quot;flipping the wheel&quot;:<img src="GreenPenny.gif" width="38" height="41"></strong></h3>
    <p class="feature">Each starter chain can bring up three possible heroic opportunities. A common, uncommon, and a rare. For the scout solo HO, they are: Ringing Blow, Swindler's Luck, and Bravo's Dance. As a scout, you have a control over the heroic opportunity wheel that no other class has. You can &quot;flip&quot; the HO if it is not one you want. You will notice at the bottom right hand corner of the heroic opportunity there is a coin icon. If you use a skill with the coin icon, you have a chance of getting on of the other possible heroic opportunities. This can be extremely usefull to get that direct damage out rather then a combat buff. This skill works on all HO's, not just your solo. As you get more skills with coin icons, this becomes an easy thing to do. </p>
    <h3 class="feature style3"><strong>Completing the heroic opportunity:</strong></h3>
    <p class="feature">Now that you have the heroic opportunity wheel up, you need to look at the blinking icons in the wheel. For the scout solo heroic opportunities it is always a green dagger no matter which one of the three possibilities comes up. So, you will need to use a skill that has a green dagger icon associated with it. The first one that you recieve is Quick Strike. Hit the quick strike icon in your hotbar to complete the heroic opportunity.</p>
