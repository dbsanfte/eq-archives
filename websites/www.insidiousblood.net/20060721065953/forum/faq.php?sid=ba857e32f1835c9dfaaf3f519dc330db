			<h2>Login and Registration Issues</h2>
							<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f00"><strong>Why can’t I login?</strong></dt>
					<dd>There are several reasons why this could occur. First, ensure your username and password are correct. If they are, contact the board owner to make sure you haven’t been banned. It is also possible the website owner has a configuration error on their end, and they would need to fix it.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f01"><strong>Why do I need to register at all?</strong></dt>
					<dd>You may not have to, it is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order to post messages. However; registration will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such as definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing of fellow users, usergroup subscription, etc. It only takes a few moments to register so it is recommended you do so.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f02"><strong>Why do I get logged off automatically?</strong></dt>
					<dd>If you do not check the <em>Log me in automatically</em> box when you login, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university computer lab, etc. If you do not see this checkbox, it means the board administrator has disabled this feature.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f03"><strong>How do I prevent my username appearing in the online user listings?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Within your User Control Panel, under “Board preferences”, you will find the option <em>Hide your online status</em>. Enable this option with <samp>Yes</samp> and you will only appear to the administrators, moderators and yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f04"><strong>I’ve lost my password!</strong></dt>
					<dd>Don’t panic! While your password cannot be retrieved, it can easily be reset. Visit the login page and click <em>I’ve forgotten my password</em>. Follow the instructions and you should be able to log in again shortly.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f05"><strong>I registered but cannot login!</strong></dt>
					<dd>First, check your username and password. If they are correct, then one of two things may have happened. If COPPA support is enabled and you specified being under 13 years old during registration, you will have to follow the instructions you received. Some boards will also require new registrations to be activated, either by yourself or by an administrator before you can logon; this information was present during registration. If you were sent an e-mail, follow the instructions. If you did not receive an e-mail, you may have provided an incorrect e-mail address or the e-mail may have been picked up by a spam filer. If you are sure the e-mail address you provided is correct, try contacting an administrator.</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f06"><strong>I registered in the past but cannot login any more?!</strong></dt>
					<dd>Attempt to locate the e-mail sent to you when you first registered, check your username and password and try again. It is possible an administrator has deactivated or deleted your account for some reason. Also, many boards periodically remove users who have not posted for a long time to reduce the size of the database. If this has happened, try registering again and being more involved in discussions.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f07"><strong>What is COPPA?</strong></dt>
					<dd>COPPA, or the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998, is a law in the United States requiring websites which can potentially collect information from minors under the age of 13 to have written parental consent or some other method of legal guardian acknowledgment, allowing the collection of personally identifiable information from a minor under the age of 13. If you are unsure if this applies to you as someone trying to register or to the website you are trying to register on, contact legal counsel for assistance. Please note that the phpBB Group cannot provide legal advice and is not a point of contact for legal concerns of any kind, except as outlined below.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f08"><strong>Why can’t I register?</strong></dt>
					<dd>It is possible the website owner has banned your IP address or disallowed the username you are attempting to register. The website owner could have also disabled registration to prevent new visitors from signing up. Contact a board administrator for assistance.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f09"><strong>What does the “Delete all board cookies” do?</strong></dt>
					<dd>“Delete all board cookies” deletes the cookies created by phpBB which keep you authenticated and logged into the board. It also provides functions such as read tracking if they have been enabled by the board owner. If you are having login or logout problems, deleting board cookies may help.</dd>

			<h2>User Preferences and settings</h2>
							<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f10"><strong>How do I change my settings?</strong></dt>
					<dd>If you are a registered user, all your settings are stored in the board database. To alter them, visit your User Control Panel; a link can usually be found at the top of board pages. This system will allow you to change all your settings and preferences.</dd>

					<dt id="f11"><strong>The times are not correct!</strong></dt>
					<dd>It is possible the time displayed is from a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, visit your User Control Panel and change your timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. If you are not registered, this is a good time to do so.</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f12"><strong>I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!</strong></dt>
					<dd>If you are sure you have set the timezone and Summer Time/DST correctly and the time is still incorrect, then the time stored on the server clock is incorrect. Please notify an administrator to correct the problem.</dd>
					<dd><a href="#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f13"><strong>My language is not in the list!</strong></dt>
					<dd>Either the administrator has not installed your language or nobody has translated this board into your language. Try asking the board administrator if they can install the language pack you need. If the language pack does not exist, feel free to create a new translation. More information can be found at the phpBB website (see link at the bottom of board pages).</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f14"><strong>How do I show an image below my username?</strong></dt>
					<dd>There are two images that may appear below a username when viewing posts. Depending on the used style, the first may be an image associated with your rank, generally in the form of stars, blocks or dots, indicating how many posts you have made or your status on the board. The second, usually a larger image, is known as an avatar and is generally unique or personal to each user. It is up to the board administrator to enable avatars and to choose the way in which avatars can be made available. If you are unable to use avatars, contact a board administrator and ask them for their reasons.</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f15"><strong>What is my rank and how do I change it?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Ranks, which appear below your username, indicate the number of posts you have made or identify certain users, e.g. moderators and administrators. In general, you cannot directly change the wording of any board ranks as they are set by the board administrator. Please do not abuse the board by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank. Most boards will not tolerate this and the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post count.</dd>

							<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f20"><strong>How do I post a topic in a forum?</strong></dt>
					<dd>To post a new topic in a forum, click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. A list of your permissions in each forum is available at the bottom of the forum and topic screens. Example: You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc.</dd>

					<dt id="f21"><strong>How do I edit or delete a post?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Unless you are a board administrator or moderator, you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post by clicking the edit button for the relevant post, sometimes for only a limited time after the post was made. If someone has already replied to the post, you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic which lists the number of times you edited it along with the date and time. This will only appear if someone has made a reply; it will not appear if a moderator or administrator edited the post, though they may leave a note as to why they’ve edited the post at their own digression. Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f22"><strong>How do I add a signature to my post?</strong></dt>
					<dd>To add a signature to a post you must first create one via your User Control Panel. Once created, you can check the <em>Add signature</em> box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio button in your profile. If you do so, you can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box within the posting form.</dd>

					<dd>When posting a new topic or editing the first post of a topic, click the “Poll creation” tab below the main posting form; if you cannot see this, you do not have appropriate permissions to create polls. Enter a title and at least two options in the appropriate fields, making sure each option is on a separate line in the textarea. You can also set the number of options users may select during voting under “Options per user”, a time limit in days for the poll (0 for infinite duration) and lastly the option to allow users to amend their votes.</dd>

				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f25"><strong>How do I edit or delete a poll?</strong></dt>
					<dd>As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator or an administrator. To edit a poll, click to edit the first post in the topic; this always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote, users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if members have already placed votes, only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it. This prevents the poll’s options from being changed mid-way through a poll.</dd>

			<h2>Formatting and Topic Types</h2>
							<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f30"><strong>What is BBCode?</strong></dt>
					<dd>BBCode is a special implementation of HTML, offering great formatting control on particular objects in a post. The use of BBCode is granted by the administrator, but it can also be disabled on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML, but tags are enclosed in square brackets [ and ] rather than &lt; and &gt;. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f31"><strong>Can I use HTML?</strong></dt>
					<dd>No. It is not possible to post HTML on this board and have it rendered as HTML. Most formatting which can be carried out using HTML can be applied using BBCode instead.</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f32"><strong>What are Smilies?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Smilies, or Emoticons, are small images which can be used to express a feeling using a short code, e.g. :) denotes happy, while :( denotes sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen in the posting form. Try not to overuse smilies, however, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may edit them out or remove the post altogether. The board administrator may also have set a limit to the number of smilies you may use within a post.</dd>

				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f33"><strong>Can I post images?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Yes, images can be shown in your posts. If the administrator has allowed attachments, you may be able to upload the image to the board. Otherwise, you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.example.com/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor images stored behind authentication mechanisms, e.g. hotmail or yahoo mailboxes, password protected sites, etc. To display the image use the BBCode [img] tag.</dd>

			<h2>User Levels and Groups</h2>
							<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f40"><strong>What are Administrators?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Administrators are members assigned with the highest level of control over the entire board. These members can control all facets of board operation, including setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc., dependent upon the board founder and what permissions he or she has given the other administrators. They may also have full moderator capabilities in all forums, depending on the settings put forth by the board founder.</dd>

					<dt id="f41"><strong>What are Moderators?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) who look after the forums from day to day. They have the authority to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally, moderators are present to prevent users from going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.</dd>

				<hr class="dashed" />				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f42"><strong>What are usergroups?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Usergroups are groups of users that divide the community into manageable sections board administrators can work with. Each user can belong to several groups and each group can be assigned individual permissions. This provides an easy way for administrators to change permissions for many users at once, such as changing moderator permissions or granting users access to a private forum.</dd>

Not all groups have open access, however. Some may require approval to join, some may be closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the group is open, you can join it by clicking the appropriate button. If a group requires approval to join you may request to join by clicking the appropriate button. The user group leader will need to approve your request and may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not harass a group leader if they reject your request; they will have their reasons.</dd>
