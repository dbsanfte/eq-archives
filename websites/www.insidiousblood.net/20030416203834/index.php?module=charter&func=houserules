<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="roster"><tr><td><P><font class="title-boldyellow">House Rules</font></P><P><B>Bolak tells the guild, "Not one single member is greater than iB."</B><BR>Never forget that line, or who said it. Ever.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Respect</font></P><P>Respect's a fine thing. It's the place where the bullshit stops and the friendships begin. All members are required to treat each other as equals, and must show respect for each other even if they are on bad terms or in disagreement. Be mature, don't be some snot nosed punk with a chip on his shoulder and a bad attitude. If you have REAL problems with someone take it to an officer. They'll help you out. This might look like it contradicts our general behavior, but it doesn't. It's a fine line to walk between being cocky, just teasing someone, and openly flaming them or insulting them. One is done in fun, the other is done in malice. There's no place for malice in IB. You're expected to be an adult, and work things out accordingly. So fuck off.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Courtesy</font></P><P>Be courteous to others. We aren't going to pretend we are always polite, or that we don't use profanity, or that we don't engage in smack talk, because we do. What we will say is that we don't get up in someone's grill until they've done it to us first. Don't flame those who haven't earned it, don't unjustly attack or train anyone, don't be a jackass. Keep the profanity and loquacious behavior confined to guild chat. Joking around in good fun is fine, but you know damn well when you are crossing the line. If you find yourself thinking twice about something, drop it. If you manage to step over the line you'll be treated to a stunning multi-officer bitchslap as well as dozens of tasty flames. If Jilaman tells you to STFU, you KNOW you've got problems...</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Equality</font></P><P>Each and every member of Insidious Blood holds equal standing with every other member. Every voice has equal weight on guild issues. No one will be censored for their opinions and no one should feel as though they cannot speak their mind. In fact, you'll find that most of us love to speak our mind, loudly and repeatedly, about anything, regardless of our knowledge on the subject. If something's going on don't be afraid to pipe up and get involved, unless it involves Jilaman, Bame, Selwyn, Verte or Chopasuey. If they start something you may want to run and hide. Oh and don't pay any attention to Sivar, he's harmless... most of the time.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Loyalty</font></P><P>Not one single member is greater than IB. We expect you to give your all for the guild, and in return we will give our all for you. If someone needs your help, give it. If you need some help, ask for it (you may have to ask LOUDLY to get our attention) and you'll get it. You'll find that we put the guild first a lot of the time... if you're camping an epic mob and something pops that we need to mobilize for, don't get pissed and think we're out to fuck you when your group leaves to join the raid. We'll get the things you want, but we've got to do the things that help the guild and the majority of the members first. We can help finish quests anytime, but if a boss pops and we need him, we gotta move fast or it'll be dead before we blink. There will be many slow days to work on quests and experience. You'll find that 1-3 groups of IB can do things you're used to seeing done only with a full sized raid.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Fun</font></P><P>This is a game. Enjoy it. Have FUN. If you find yourself twitching because we lost a kill or wiped out... if you're about to wig because you just aren't in the mood for our usual brand of asinine humor... then our job here is done. Our predatory flamers can smell a wig coming an hour away and will gleefully light fuses until someone goes off. Do your worst, your wig will be rated at the end of the raid, and players consistently scoring below a 5.0 out of 10.0 for content and vitriol will be sent to wig rehab with Selwyn, Jilaman, Skrilla, and Bame. They'll show you how to do it right. Those who consistently fail to come up with accurate and scathing flames will be treated to a blistering session with Raviel and Ecsema.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Message Board</font></P><P>Visit and post on the <a href="http://forum.insidiousblood.net" target="_blank">Message Board</a>.  If you don't you can get your access removed and have to ask that silly dr00d for access again.  The message board is the center of communication for the guild, if you don't go there, you are missing out.  If you do not have access to the forum, e-mail <a href="mailto:tymmon@insidiousblood.net">tymmon@insidiousblood.net</a> or send a private message to Tymmon.  Read the wigs, read the flames, read the strats, read Bawit's annoying ham recipes that make you want to kick his ass, especially when you're hungry at work. Hell, post if you feel like it. Just be sure to show up there once in awhile or we'll force you to help Mazirus with his quests and trade skills for a few days.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Guild Website</font></P><P>Create a profile on the <a href="http://www.insidiousblood.net" target="_blank">website.</a>  Log into the website and create a profile there for all of your characters. Fill the shit out accurately, our officers use this to keep tabs on how everyone's doing for gear. No profile, no loot consideration, so get your lewtwhore ass up there and create one. Send pictures for the roster to <a href="mailto:screenshots@insidiousblood.net">screenshots@insidiousblood.net</a> and make sure it is 300x389 pixels in size.  We have paparazzi who will ninja your picture at the worst time to update the profile, unless you want to send us a good picture before they get to you...</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Magelo Profiles</font></P><P>Create a <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com" target="_blank">Magelo</A> profile for each of your characters in the guild.  At least, if you want any loot. Magelo profiles are the tool of choice for reviewing the status of our guildmembers with regards to loot and progression in the game. If you don't have a magelo profile, the officers won't know what you have for gear and won't include you in the loot decisions.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Members Only</font></P><P>Visit the members section on the message board. You'll find a forum there called Roadmaps. This is a place for you to post your gear wishlist, as well as your plans on getting tradeskills, finishing quests, and just about any other old thing you want to do in game that interests you. We use this forum to keep tabs on what our members are up to, so please post a roadmap and keep it up to date.  You should make 2 magelo profiles.  One is for your current gear.  The other is for the gear you would like to get.  Post the links in the roadmaps section.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Never Go Anonymous</font></P><P>Do not go anonymous!  You hide your guild tag, we'll take it away from you so that you don't have anything to be embarrassed about. We want to see who's online at all times. If you're camping Orc1 in EC use /role if the tells are getting to you. Most of the newbies know better than to send tells to random IB members asking for handouts. Last time that happened, someone was bugging Sivar for a translocation. Sivar sacrificed him, and the poor sap hit yes apparently. After that word kinda gets around...</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Raid Attendance</font></P><P>Unlike most of these hapless uberguilds you read about clearing Vex Thal with just a Bard and a Mage, we actually believe that real life is more important than Everquest. Hence, our raid attendance policy is actually quite simple. We maintain close to one hundred active members in the guild at a time, so this policy works out very, very well.</P><P><B>We expect to see our members playing between four and seven days a week for periods of four hours or more per session.</B></P><P>When you play Everquest, and how long you play it for, are pretty much up to you. Take days or weeks off if you have shit to do in RL or if you're flipping out about the game and need a break; nobody's going to fault you for that. However... we're going to be mighty put out with members (especially new members) who just suddenly disappear with no warning, no explanation, and then take weeks or months off. We're trying to build a guild of hardcore everquest players who want to see and do everything during the time they spend in the game.  Occasionally, we'll plan something really big where we want everyone to try and be online. This usually only happens on a first attempt at a new ubermob or when we are really, really fucking pissed off at something and need to destroy it with zealous prejudice. When that day comes we can summon an army that makes the zergling guilds stare in total awe... but we don't call it zerging, since that implies a lack of skill. We prefer Blitzkrieg, for utter fucking death and annihilation.</P><P><B>By the way... poor raid attendance means you won't be getting much, if any, of the loot.</B></P><P>We reward players for time invested. Those who invest more, get more. You'll be last in line if you don't show up.  This is a raiding guild.  If you're online, and you've got the time, and you're level 65, <B>Get the Fuck to the Raid(tm)</B>.  If you're just popping in to say hi and get in some quick cyber, don't worry about the raids that are going on, you'll be wasting your time and ours by getting there only to have to leave right away. Make sure you attend a couple of raids a week, the times you choose to attend are left up to you... use whatever fits your schedule. Most of us are around from 7PM EST to Midnight EST every day of the week, with longer hours on weekends.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Guild Chat</font></P><P>Keep it on ALL the time, unless it's giving you a really bad migraine. This is where all the fun happens.  Keep it profane, furious, and funny. All of the GMs are reading it, as well as spies from most other guilds on the server, and we wouldn't want to disappoint them.  Keep the real personal attacks out of it. If you've got personal problems with another guild member, the last thing, I mean the very last thing you want to do is drag it into guild chat. Our flamers will take one look at that and unleash the fires of hell on both of you, and the gloves will be off. Assuming your monitor survives the experience, you certainly won't, once the officers get a hold of your punk ass.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Public Chat Channel Guidelines</font></P><P>Keep the profanity out of public chat channels. Also refrain from making idiotic and asinine statements in public channels. There's a FnR chat channel on the server, if you need to vent then get your ass in there and do it. If you absolutely *MUST* harass someone in public chat, at least have the courtesy not to put the guild in a bad position, and keep it clean <B>(read: unactionable by GMs)</B>. If, for example, you talk smack for an hour about our capabilities, then we fail miserably on an encounter, and look like asses because of what you said, you'll be spending some time locked in a prison cell with Chopasuey, where he will show you the true meaning of sodomy.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Flames and Rants and Smack Talk</font></P><P>You're from Luclin. You have a fine, glorious and filthy tradition to uphold. If you're going to flame, keep is sensible, short, entertaining, scathing, and accurate. You'll be scored by other guildmates, and those consistently scoring below a 7.0 of 10.0 will get treated to a public roasting on the Luclin FnR forum, complete with screenshots and quotes of whatever lame flame you used that earned you this honor. Lay off using the gay cock and faggot jokes, this isn't Torvonnilous. Stick to the highbrow psychological barbs and the invincible irony and sarcasm that Luclin is famous for.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Guild Issues and Public Forums</font></P><P>Don't be a fucking retard! Keep guild issues confined to guild chat and the guild message boards. Posting quotes from the guild message boards and chat logs in game about controversial or private guild issues will get you on some thin ice very quickly, and the officers will be under it when it breaks. If you've got problems, flame away on the member message boards, but that's as far as it goes, period.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Guild Officers</font></P><ul><P><li><B>Chopasuey</B> is the guild leader and as such has the final word on any and all issues, period, end of story. If you piss him off you'll get to spend several hours deepthroating his tail while you beg for forgiveness. This leezard puts up with entirely too much shit, so if you've got problems, take it to one of the officers unless it involves him directly.  Oh, yeah, almost forgot... we do have some folks who have an officer tag.<BR><li><B>Teana</B> is the guild vault whore and second in command. She manages spells, gems and cash.<BR><li><B>Sivar</B> is the raid bitch. He's the holder of The Schedule(tm) and maintains IB's plans for world domination.<BR><li><B>Krillian</B> is the token Ubermonk and all 'round strategy guy.<BR><li><B>Thurack</B> ... owns you. Nuff said.<BR><li><B>Jahid</B> ... no idea what Jahid does, think he takes out the garbage or something.<BR><li><B>Drah</B> also owns you, more then Thurack does though. Nuff said.<BR><li><B>Sakasis</B> must do something... damned if we know what it is.<BR></P></ul></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>							</td>
