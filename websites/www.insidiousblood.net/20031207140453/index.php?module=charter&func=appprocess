week</font><P><P>We only invite members who can spend enough time playing EverQuest to contribute to the steady growth and maintenance of a raiding guild. Currently this means we expect you to be able to play four to seven days a week, four or more hours per session.</P><P>If you can't handle that (the majority of the time, people do take breaks and vacations) then save yourself the time and save us the aggravation of running you through the app process. Anyone who raids all the time when apping but only shows up once a week after being invited is on a quick ride straight back out the door.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">You Must Have All Expansions Enabled</font></P><P>Have every expansion available enabled. We're a raiding guild, we raid everywhere and use all the tools available to us from every expansion. If you lack an expansion it means you are unable to contribute to an inumerable amount of raids. Your application will not be accepted if you do not have all expansions enabled.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">All Tier One and Two Flags are Required:</font></P><P>You must complete all tier one and two flags.  You'd be doing well to have finished all of your keys and as much flagging from PoP as you can before joining.</P><B>Tier 1 Flags</B><LI>Aid Mauvin in the Plane of Justice<LI>Kill Grummus in the Plane of Disease<LI>Kill Behemoth in the Plane of Innovation<LI>Help Elder Poxhborne through the hedges in the Plane of Nightmare<LI>Kill Terris Thule in The Lair of Terris Thule<br><br><B>Tier 2 Flags</B><LI>Kill the High Priest in the Crypt of Decay<LI>Kill Bertoxxulous in the Crypt of Decay<LI>Aid Askr the Lost in the Plane of Storms<LI>Kill Aerin'Dar in the Plane of Valor<LI>Kill the Keeper of Sorrows and Dream in the Plane of Torment<LI>Kill Saryrn in the Plane of Torment<LI>Kill Tallon Zek in the Plane of Tactics<LI>Kill Vallon Zek in the Plane of Tactics<P><font class="title-boldyellow">You MUST have a Guild Sponsor:</font></P><P>Now you have the unpleasant task of convincing a current and active member of Insidious Blood to sponsor you. IB members may only sponsor one applicant at a time, period, and how you perform reflects on their reputation so they will not give this out lightly. Once you find someone in the guild you can sufficiently awe, inspire, or bribe, they'll be your contact for information about what the guild is doing at any given time. Most guild members prefer cash.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">You need to have unbuffed resists:</font></P><P>We require you to have over 130 on any one resist without buffs.  If you don't have the resists, you end up dying all the time like Cobee.  You also spend a lot of time at your bind point so make sure it is in a fun filled spot where you will not get begged for SoW.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Know Your Role:</font></P><P>Everybody's got roles in the end game. You'd better know yours and LOVE it before you decide to start building up your class on raids. When we start making you uber, we're going to be sorely pissed off if you just up and change your mind about what class you want to play.  We are guilding your character and your character's class.  You have to okay a character change with <b>Teana</b> before you even think about doing it.  By now you should know what you want to do in the end game, and if you're going to join us, one of the requirements is that you've got your shit sorted out, play styles included. Your role is determined by whatever makes you most valuable to the raid at any given time, not by your current mood or the alignment of the fucking stars.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Raiding Time:</font></P><P>Our raid times typically range from 7:00 PM EST to Midnight EST on the weekdays and Noon EST to 2 AM EST on the weekends.  This does not mean we will be raiding at these times.  If you are online during these times, you are required to attend the raid as called by the officers.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Participate when we Raid:</font></P><P>Get your ass to raids. You've got a bare minimum of twenty raids in four weeks to attend. You are welcome to come to just about any event in that four week period, so don't get the idea that we only want you at twenty of them. The more you can attend, the better. Talk to your sponsor to find out what is going on at any given time, or chat with an officer if they are not online. Getting to know everyone, and getting them to know you, is the key to getting into IB. Once four weeks have gone by, we'll review your app and call a vote.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Group when we don't Raid:</font></P><P>Group with IB members as much as possible so we can corrupt you more efficiently. Join the applicant channel and use your sponsor to advertise in guild chat when you are available. These are the people who will vote for you. If they don’t know you, they don’t have to vote. Stop with the gay grinding in Velks and come with us to some more dangerous and interesting places... and feel free to flame our members if they are too chicken shit to try out anything dangerous. IB xp groups tend to make people twitch and hide at the mere mention of a dungeon.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Get in IRC:</font></P><P>You wouldn't believe how many IB folks actually have jobs. We hang out in IRC as an unofficial support group for each other while working out in the big boring blue room known as RL. Get yourself a chat client like Mirc and hook up to irc.stratics.com, then join #ib. If that's too complicated for you, then just <a href="http://www.insidiousblood.net/index.php?module=irc_chat" target="_blank">click here</a> and use our java chat interface for IRC.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Make An Official Membership Application:</font></P><P>When you have a sponsor, you can now submit an application. Yes, fuckface, you now have NO CHOICE but to register for the forums if you want to join this guild. Filling out the application does this for you. You will be emailed a copy of your application. You need a valid email to join the forums and to get a copy of your application. Your application will be refused if your email gets bounced back to us. If you use Hotmail, check your damn mail and remove the SPAM before doing this. You have to get a hold of Naeldair or Teana to make sure everything with your application is okay and to verify level and class. Make sure your application is correct before you hit submit, you do not have a chance at changing it. Once this is done, you can't view it or edit it, or view any of the replies. Only members can reply to or view the application thread. In your post, you've got the pleasure of writing a book to impress the rest of us. We want to know why you want to join IB, and we also want to know every bit of your sorry, sordid history from the first day your newbie ass clicked on the character creation screen. Your history with past guilds and servers, as well as reasons for leaving them, is very important. You then have to pay up and get your sponsor to post his own comments describing in detail how much money you spent to bribe him and exactly why he thinks you should be allowed into the guild.</P><P>Click <a href="http://www.insidiousblood.net/index.php?module=guildapp">[here to fill out the online application form]</a>.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Wait For The Vote:</font></P><P>Once your time is up and we feel folks have gotten to know you, we'll call a vote. This will only happen at a raid where you are in attendance. We have a guideline of a minimum of twenty yes votes for a new member to be admitted. Only those who know you are required to vote. A single NO vote can torpedo you in an instant, especially if the person voting no has a good reason for it. Once we finish flaming each other and discussing your status you'll get an answer from the recruitment officer and an invite on the spot if you make it in. Now you're on probation.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Probationary Membership Period:</font></P><P>You'll be probationary for four weeks. All that means is that you can't sponsor new members and vote on applicants. Take the four weeks to decide if this is where you really want to be. We will use these four weeks to gleefully push your buttons and find out how much shit you can take and/or dish out. If you manage to survive you're a full member. We can terminate your membership for any reason during these four weeks, as can you. After that, we'll hunt you down like rabid dogs if you guildremove.</P><P><font class="title-boldyellow">Questions:</font></P><P>Got questions about recruitment? Talk to <b>Naeldair</b> in game or in IRC or via <a href="mailto:naeldair@insidiousblood.net">email</a>.  Having trouble with this application or registering on the boards? Talk to <b>Tymmon</b> in game or in IRC or via <a href="mailto:tymmon@insidiousblood.net">email</a>.</P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr>
