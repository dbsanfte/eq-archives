	We axed CT once again on Tuesday, and this time actually got some caster loot. Bobertson made off with some

	Ainthe a nice robe,	Quen a <a href="images/halooftheenlightened.jpg">halo </a>and Docvahn the

    twice too.  Tonight though we
	did the 425 Dain and actually lost the first time. Boggled by the loss we rebuffed and pulled him again and
    completely owned
	the bastard with a grand total of 4 deaths. Well i don't know for sure if the muzzle of mardu
    hastens npc's like it does pets, but some asshole put it on him.

    Yeah, I know, we are probably the only guild who's backbone warriors are
    pansy elves. Verant kindly provided Inno with <a href="images/leatherfootsandals.jpg"> odor eaters</a>
    at least for the halflings, though Nedden himself was not to thrilled with
    this <img border="0" src="images/nedfeet.gif" width="609" height="16">. I hate hobbits. Almost as
    much as I hate dorfs, which is what the next item Inny dropped. Reeking of
    stale beer pretty much just left Drueen as the only taker on the <a href="images/brewersmeshcloak.jpg">brewer's
    mesh cloak</a>. Drueen was later caught trying to suck what we can only
    guess as beer from the cloak, everybody was to afraid to ask though. Last
    item went to the erud Cyprusia... a nice set of pauldrons that I luckily
    forget to get a screenshot of, so I get to go pester her later.&nbsp;

    Earlier in the week we rolled the Dain for the umpteenth

    <font size=-1 face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> Wielding the very nerf stick Verant used to beat the cleric's upside the head, Talisman took down
    the sorcerer Velketor again. Was by far and away our best fight, probably because the nerf stick reduced velk down to a lvl 1 gnome wiz. The 
    poor giant was chased around the castle for a good hour by Surox and Gorum, both of whom where seriously encumbered trying to lug around
    an unwieldy gas grill.

	Unfortunatly for us it seems the nerf stick effects the loot table too, because we got a bunch of crap. 
	Gratz Jienna, BerryOhSoFyne, and Ggak on yer velk trophies!
