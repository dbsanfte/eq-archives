<B>EYEGIVE INFORMATION</B>
<P>
Recently, Michael Randall (co-owner of the Just a Ride club and homepage), contacted me regarding EyeGive, something which could prove very worthwhile for those of you who want to help out the Bill Hicks Wildlife Rehabilitation Fund. Here's what Michael had to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="1">
"EyeGive (<A HREF="http://www.eyegive.com">http://www.eyegive.com</A>) is a company (for profit, not charity) that will make you a home page which consists mainly of adverts. When you click on one of these ads, they get money from the advertiser, and give half to your chosen charity.
<P>
"To join up, and make the Foundation your chosen charity, <A HREF="http://www.eyegive.com/html/ssi.cfm?CID=2872&MID=15423">click here</A>.
<P>
"They [the Wildlife Fund] will get $1 as soon as someone signs up, then they reckon around $20 a year from a regular user."
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
What have you got to lose? Head on over to EyeGive and help out a very good cause.
