Comedy is a lot like music, or any of the other branches of the entertainment industry. You've
     got your Seinfelds and Reisers and Foxworthys, whose easy, inoffensive styles gain them
     massive sitcom success and huge mainstream audiences - the standup Hooties, if you will.
     Then there are your smarter, more individual comics whose talents eventually break them
     through to wider popular acceptance; Degeneres, Carey, and other inimitable yet famous
     names are the Soundgardens and Green Days of their field - their ëovernight' TV successes are
     in reality the result of years spent honing their skills in obscurity. Comedy also has its share of
     past legends and perennial standard-bearers - Bruce is to Hendrix as Kovacs is to Zeppelin, the
     mythic greats, and Dennis Miller and The Kids in the Hall are Sonic Youth and Jane's
     Addiction, examples of cutting-edge innovation and quality, making the grade without
     sacrificing integrity, and continuously pushing the envelope.

     Comedy has its share of undergrounders, as well; standups who craft insightful, inspiring
     diatribes that reflect their understanding and confusion regarding the world around them, bits
     that both answer questions and ask some of their own. Artists like Andy Kindler, Jake
     Johanssen, and Greer Barnes won't ever have their own show. Their styles are too obtuse, and
     too close to home for comfortable mass consumption; they're also some of the sharpest minds
     currently writing funny. They will continue to tour now that the standup fad has officially
     faded, opening (and blowing) a few minds at every stop, and their boob tube career will consist
     of a couple of lines on Suddenly Susan, or maybe of writing the most brilliant joke in
     Letterman's monologue some night, the one with the most awkward crowd response. They are
     the Pavements and Guided by Voices, original voices within, and masters of, their craft, and
     meant only for those in the audience who get it. This is not wit for those who find Homeboys
     in Outer Space a poignant and compelling foray into the comedic arts.

     Sometime in 1991, a friend of my roommate's lent us Relentless, a taped live set by an
     unknown comic named Bill Hicks released on somebody's homespun label. We were intrigued
     because said friend was a) an intelligent, open-minded pothead who b) shared our belief that
     good comedy absolutely had to be smart and sarcastic.

     He never got his tape back.

     What we heard wasn't so much a performed set of standup comedy as a combination
     bullshit-obliterator/philosophy thesis/wake-up call made funny. Bill Hicks wanted to make you
     laugh, but he also wanted to tell you things, ask you things, and make you think. He didn't
     want to know where anyone in the crowd was from; he didn't want to know the crowd. He
     didn't want to talk about answering machines, or New York cabdrivers, or people's pets, or
     any of the trivial aspects of daily life that most comics expand on to ëcover' the audience.
     What Bill DID want to talk about was shit that NOBODY wanted to talk about, much less a
     man standing alone in front of a roomful of strangers who paid to drown their troubles in
     mirth. The original tape case for Relentless bore the following warning:

     This album contains EVERYTHING your parents hate,

     EVERYTHING the Church preaches against,

     EVERYTHING the Government fears.

     Enjoy, Bill Hicks

     He wasn't kidding. Topics covered on the album included such lighthearted comic fare as the
     irrelevance of Christianity, the stupidity of white-trash Southerners, and the positive effects
     recreational drug use has had on popular culture, as well as a few of Bill's own ideas, like using
     terminally ill medical patients as stuntpeople in the movies, families foregoing the usual
     summer vacation in favor of staying home and taking psilocybin mushrooms together, mankind
     realizing that physical reality is and illusion and that we are all eternally one with God (how's
     that for a little chuckle-nugget?), and Ted Turner making up most of CNN's dreadful news
     reports because Jane Fonda wouldn't have sex with him.

     And it's all hilarious. In Bill's opinion, the easily offended and the close-minded are not even
     worth worrying about, and so his delivery is shocking and no-holds-barred. He rails against the
     U.S. Governments' regulating anything regarding personal choice (drugs, pornography,
     abortion) and its vast expenditures fueling worldwide violence as a distraction from the
     domestic problems with education and welfare. He attacks undereducated trailer-park denizens
     for breeding without check (not exactly PC). He suggests that pot and hallucinogenic
     mushrooms were placed on the earth by a benevolent diety to aid mankind's evolution, and
     that at some point in said evolution, it would be logical to recognize all weaponry as
     counterproductive and beneath us as a race, and discard it. And he puts these and all his other
     beliefs forward as though he is positive that any sane, rational and educated human being
     would realize them for the logical conclusions they are. 

     While some of the liberals out there might think ëwell, I agree with all of that, except the
     terminally ill stuntman thing, so what do those nasty Republicans find so offensive about Bill?

     It's in the delivery, and if you haven't seen or heard him, you can't understand. Bill was
     hell-bent on knocking down the walls of perceived environment and, as he put it, "squeegeeing
     your third fuckin' eye." He did not flinch, and if you did, and he saw, you were dogmeat. Bill
     was sick of people wrapping themselves in the protective blanket of selective perception; he
     viewed it as a pathetic weakness, and woe be to those who deigned to let others do their
     thinking for them. Relentless and its predecessor Dangerous were exactly those things,
     introductions to a well-thought-out battering ram designed to punch through the soft, fatty shell
     of mass America's voluntary ignorance.

     As a master showman, Bill made some of his bitter pills fun to put in your mouth, if not easy
     to swallow. His drug stories held enough wackiness to make the acid-naive in the audience
     chortle, but cleverly pointed out that the vast majority of users never hurt themselves, or
     anyone else. His anti-nonsmoker rants (which may be the only reason any
     non-comedy-enthralled pundits have heard of him) rallied the tobacco-friendly, and those few
     nonsmokers with a sense of humor could laugh at their own self-righteous behavior. I won't
     kid, however; any material that Bill marginally ësoftened' was more than balanced by the stuff
     that he intentionally toughened up, and delivered balls-out in his attempt to get the point
     across. A more recent bit depicting several Republican presidents urinating on Rush Limbaugh
     to get him off would turn whatever part of your stomach isn't clenched in knots from laughter,
     and his attacks on those normal folks too scared, too bombarded, or just too damn dumb to
     see all of this life's extraneous bullshit and folly for what it is often borders on abusive (one
     rumor has it that Bill had both his legs broken by a disgruntled southern audience member after
     a show - another version of this tale holds that one leg was broken by a bartender who'd had
     more than enough of Bill's drunken holding forth one night).

     But for all of his cynicism and disgust, Bill's real message was one of hope. He showed us all
     of the shitty things, all of the falseness and irrelevance, so that we could do away with it, pull
     up the shades and knock down the false fronts to see what the real next step in humankind's
     journey should be. He wanted us to know there were options apart from hunkering down into
     the grimy little corner we as a latter twentieth-century species seem to have civilized ourselves
     into. The vulgarity and shock was, to him, necessary to quantify just how ugly things have
     gotten, and was set off by his clear vision of how beautiful this existence could and should be.

     After more than fifteen years of standup (he started when he was fifteen), countless miles on
     the road, two albums, HBO and Comedy Central spotlights, and various talk show
     appearances, including an astounding eleven performances on Letterman, Bill Hicks died of
     pancreatic cancer in February of 1994, at the early age of thirty-two and, though critically
     lauded, still a comparatively unknown comic. While much of his press places Bill on the edge
     of a breakthrough at the time of his death, his rise to mass awareness was at best unlikely.
     While any and every worthwhile standup working today will rave about him, iconoclastic
     bands as disparate as Tool and Radiohead have taken his point of view to heart and
     endeavored to widen his audience, and several products had approached him about doing
     commercials (Bill found these offers laughable; he regarded standup as art, and those who did
     ads as corporate shilling whores), there's just too much truth in what he had to say for
     mainstream America to bear hearing comfortably. His television appearances were too
     detoxified to evoke Bill's energy and passion - his twelfth and final Letterman appearance was
     cut from the show, hours before airtime, for being too much - and the idea of him bursting
     through an apartment set's front door to studio audience applause, with a cigarette clenched in
     his jaw and looking hung over and ready to launch into a censor-castrated prime time version
     of one of his rants, is both ludicrous and insulting. 

     The eclectic independent music label Rykodisc has rereleased both Dangerous and Relentless,
     as well as two new discs of Bill's comedy, Rant in E Minor and Arizona Bay, which were
     being edited at the time of his death. I strongly urge for anyone who appreciates a thinking
     man's wit, as well as anyone with that rarest of traits, an affinity for the plain truth, to pick
     them up (oh, and conspiracy theorists and decriers of organized religion and revolutionaries,
     this shit is required listening). I cannot recommend any one above the others, as all are
     top-notch offerings of thought-provoking hilarity, as well as serving up notes from a brilliant,
     perhaps world-changing, mind, too soon gone:

     "It's a choice for everybody, right now, between the eyes of love and the eyes of fear the eyes
     of fear would have you buy more guns, and put more locks on your doors - but the eyes of
     love, would have you put down your guns, and take that money that you spend every year on
     weapons and defense, and use it to feed, clothe, and educate every person on this planet,
     which it would, many times over, and we can explore space, together."
