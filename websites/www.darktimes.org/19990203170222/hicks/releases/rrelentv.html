Bill Hicks emerges on stage through a billowing cloud of smoke. As the dark brooding figure approaches the mic, there is an air of anticipation
tinged with tension eminating from the audience. His reputation preceeds him.<BR>
A hard-hitting,cynical and abrasive comedian who shocks his audience whilst subtly reminding them of how ridiculous the more serious
issues are taken today. Nothing escapes this treatment: George Bush, sex, war, drugs, pornography, morality, hypocrisy and religions. On 
Christians who wear crosses around their necks, he questions, "Do you really think when Jesus comes back he'll ever want to see another 
cross?"<BR>
There is a devilish aura about him as he informs the audience - "I've got bad news for non-smokers - non-smokers die ever day". After all, he's not a heavy
smoker any more - "I only go through two lighters a day".<BR>
The material on this video was recorded during a season of Bill Hicks at the Centaur Theatre during the annual Just For Laughs comedy
festical  held at Montreal, Canada, in July 1991.
