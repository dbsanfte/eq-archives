<B>HICKS PICS STILL KICK</B><BR>
<B>THE INDEPENDANT, OCTOBER 23 1994</B><BR>
<I>By Ben Thompson. Reprinted without permission.</I>
<P>
It is nearly eight months since the death of Bill Hicks. The brave, iconoclastic American
          comedian would have been 33 in a few weeks' time. It might seem depressing to dwell on
          this, but it needs dwelling on. Death has cast an abnormally long shadow over the lively arts
          this year. Hicks, with River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain, forms a trio of prematurely departed
          icons who prove that whatever else you think of the grim reaper, he certainly has taste.
          Their passing has left a spiritual hole in the middle of each of their respective fields that is
          too big to walk around. 
<P>
          For both Cobain and Phoenix, the end was - purposely or otherwise - self-administered.
          Hicks was different. His act celebrated hedonism; he spoke out in favour of recreational
          drug use and was a fanatical defender of the right to smoke. Early on in his career, his
          profligate lifestyle seemed to court the excess-fuelled, rock-star premature death which
          eventually befell his fellow Texan 'outlaw comic' Sam Kinison; yet he eventually died of
          natural causes in the ugly form of pancreatic cancer, having long since given up not only
          drink and drugs but cigarettes too. 
<P>
          "The comic is a flame - like Shiva the destroyer," Hicks told The New Yorker critic John
          Lahr in an idealistic moment in 1992. "He keeps cutting everything back to the moment."
          Comics are so much of the moment that it is difficult enough to capture what is good about
          them on TV when they are alive, and harder still for them to have an after-life. Even when
          they do - as, say, Lenny Bruce has - anyone who didn't see them perform will find it hard to
          remember what was funny about them. 
<P>
          The way forward might, as so often, lie in commercial exploitation. It's Just a Ride, the
          tribute film which makes up the first part of Totally Bill Hicks, a new Channel 4 video, offers
          fascinating insights into Hicks' life and work. There are revealing interviews with his
          parents, God-fearing Southerners who "couldn't understand why Bill used the f-word so
          much"; and with the geeky friends with whom he used to sneak off to perform at a
          rough-and-tumble Houston comedy club at the tender age of 15. 
<P>
          The affection and envy mingling in the eyes of his fellow comedians speak volumes about
          Hicks' talents. Comedians are competitive, not given to abasing themselves at the feet of
          their peers. Eddie Izzard and Sean Hughes represent Hicks' British fan-club (it could just
          have easily have been Rob Newman and Steve Coogan), but American Brett Butler is more
          revealing. Hicks' treacle-voiced fellow Southerner, star of C4's Grace Under Fire, observes
          that "For all the talk about Bill being like Hendrix or Dylan or Jim Morrison, it was Jesus
          he wanted to be." 
<P>
          The Messianic tendencies are apparent as he emerges from tongues of fire on to the
          Dominion Theatre stage on the last night of his 1992 Revelations tour. But it's the
          ordinariness of his appearance which is striking once he's taken his cowboy hat off -
          slicked-back hair, button eyes and chubby face like a potato in a stocking - and which throws
          the brilliance of his performance into even sharper relief. 
<P>
          Bill Hicks' command of the stage and of his material was so complete that it sometimes
          seems like he's using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, even when he isn't. His intensity -
          especially when personifying his own libido as the demonic Goat-boy (motto: "Let me wear
          you like a feed bag") - is almost frightening. Like the preacher he often fancied himself to
          be, Hicks could be self-righteous and he could hector, but he could also be devastating.
          "Ever noticed," he asks, "how creationists look really unevolved?" The industrial-strength
          sarcasm which went down so well in Britain landed him in trouble in the US, especially when
          applied to such targets as fundamentalist Christianity. Last October, when he turned his
          scorn on anti-abortionists in a routine being recorded for the David Letterman Show
          ("These pro-lifers... You ever look at their faces?... screws up face and assumes bitter,
          pinched voice 'I'm pro-life'... Boy, they look it, don't they?"), Hicks became too hot for even
          the supposedly cutting-edge Letterman to handle. 
<P>
          The cancelled slot had been recorded in the same theatre where Elvis's pelvis was deemed
          unsuitable for the Ed Sullivan Show, and the ensuing censorship furore spurred Hicks on
          through the rigours of chemotherapy to a final epic bout of creativity ("It was like Bill to the
          tenth power," said friend and producer Kevin Booth. "He couldn't be involved in any kind of
          mundane situation for even a second"). 
<P>
          The fruits of this - two complete albums of new material and videos of his last live
          performances - should emerge early in the new year: further timely reminders that a
          comedian can do something more than just remember old television programmes or analyse
          the difference between cats and dogs. And if American fundamentalists don't like it - "Well,"
          as Bill Hicks used to coo with deadly relish, "forgive me."
