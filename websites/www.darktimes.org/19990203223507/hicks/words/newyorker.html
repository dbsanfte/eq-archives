On October 1st, the comedian Bill Hicks, after doing his twelfth gig on the
David Letterman show, became the first comedy act to be censored at CBS's
Ed Sullivan Theatre, where Letterman is now in residence, and where Elvis
Presley was famously censored in 1956. Presley was not allowed to be shown
from the waist down. Hicks was not allowed to be shown at all. It's not
what's in Hicks' pants but what's in his head that scared the CBS
panjandrums. Hicks, a tall thirty-one-year-old Texan with a pudgy face aged
beyond its years from hard living on the road, is no motormouth vulgarian
but an exhilarating comic thinker in a renegade class all his own. Until
the ban, which, according to Hicks, earned him "more attention than my
other eleven appearances on Letterman times one hundred," Hicks' caustic
observations and mischievous cultural connections had found a wide audience
in England, where he is something of a cult figure. I caught up with Hicks
backstage on a rainy Sunday last November at the Dominion Theatre, in
London, where a record-breaking crowd of two thousand Brits was packed so
tight that they were standing three deep at the back of the dress circle to
hear Hicks deliver some acid home truths about the U.S.A., which to him
stands for United States of Advertising. Hicks thinks against society and
insists on the importance of this intellectual freedom as a way to inspire
others to think for themselves. 'To me, the comic is the guy who says 'Wait
a minute' as the consensus forms," Hicks told me as we climbed the stairs
to his dressing room. "He's the antithesis of the mob mentality. The comic
is a flamelike Shiva the Destroyer, toppling idols no matter what they
are. He keeps cutting everything back to the moment."
<P>
Even then, the talk about courting comic danger had Hicks worrying about
his prospects in America. "Comedy in the States has been totally gutted,"
he told me when we'd settled into the dressing room. "It's commercialized.
They don't have people on TV who have points of view, because that defies
the status quo, and we can't have that in the totalitarian mind-control
government that runs the fuckin' airwaves. I can't get a shot there. I get
David Letterman a lot. I love Letterman, but every time I go on, we have
tiffs over material. They love me, but his people have this fictitious
mainstream audience they think they play to. It's untrue. It doesn't exist.
I like doing the show, but it's almost like working a puzzle: How can I be
me in the context of doing this material? The best thing I do is make
connections. I connect everything. It's hard to do it in six minutes."
<P>
Hicks certainly went for broke and pronounced his real comic self in the
banned Letterman performance, which he'll be reprising in New York at
Caroline's Comedy Club on October 27th, and which he wrote out for me in a
thirty-nine-page letter that also recounts his version of events. Hicks had
to write out his set because the tape of it, which the Letterman people
said they'd send three weeks ago, had not yet reached him. He doubts it
ever will. But the routine, which he had prepared for a Letterman
appearance a week earlier (he was bumped because the show ran long), had
been, he wrote, "approved and reapproved" by a segment producer of the
show. Indicating stage directions and his recollection of significant
audience response, Hicks set out some of the "hot points" to which the
network took exception.
<P>
(Begin quotation)
You know who's really bugging me these days? These pro-lifers. . .
(Smattering of applause )
<P>
You ever look at their faces? . . . "I'm prolife!" (Here Bill makes a
pinched face of hate and fear; his lips are pursed as though he's' just
sucked on a lemon.) I'm pro-life!" Boy, they look it, don't they? They just
exude joie de vivre. You just want to hang with them and play Trivial
Pursuit all night long. (Audience chuckles.)
<P>
You know what bugs me about them? If you're so pro-life, do me a
favour-don't lock arms and block medical clinics. If you're so pro-life,
lock arms and block cemeteries.
<P>
Audience laughs.) . . . I want to see pro-lifers at funerals opening
caskets - "Get out!" Then I'd really be impressed by their mission.
(Audience laughs and applauds.)
<P>
I've been traveling a lot lately. I was over in Australia during Easter. It
was interesting to note they celebrate Easter the same way we
do commemorating; the death and resurrection of Jesus by telling our
children a giant bunny rabbit . . . left chocolate eggs in the night.
(Audience laughs.)
<P>
Gee, I wonder why we're so messed up as a race. You know, I've read the
Bible. Can't find the words "bunny" or "chocolate" in the whole book.
(Audience laughs.)
<P>
I think it's interesting how people act on their beliefs. A lot of
Christians, for instance, wear crosses around their necks. Nice sentiment,
but do you think when Jesus comes back, he's really going to want to look
at a cross? (Audience laughs. Bill makes a face of pain and horror.)
<P>
Ow! Maybe that's why he hasn't shown up vet. (As Jesus looking; down from
Heaven) "I m not going, Dad. No, they're still wearing crosses - they've
totally missed the point. when they start wearing fishes, I might go back
again.... No, I m not going.... O.K., I'll tell you what - I'll go back as a
bunny."
<P>
(End quotation)
<P>
Hicks, who delivered his monologue dressed not in his usual gunslinger
black but in "bright fall colors - an outfit bought just for the show and
reflective of my bright and cheerful mood," seemed to have a lot to smile
about. Letterman, who Hicks says greeted him as he sat down to talkwith
"Good set, Bill! Always nice to have you drop by with an uplifting
message!" and signed off saying, "Bill, enjoy answering your mail for the
next few weeks"Ñhad been seen to laugh. The word in the Green Room was also
good. A couple of hours later, Hicks was back in his hotel, wearing nothing
but a towel, when the call came from Robert Morton, the executive producer
of the Letterman show, telling him he'd been deep-sixed. Hicks sat down on
the bed.The following is a condensed version of what Hicks remembers from
the long conversation
<P>
 "I don't understand, Robert. What's the problem? I though the show went
great. 
<P>
"You killed out there," Morton said, and went on to say, according to
Hicks, that the CBS office of standards and practices felt that some of the
material was unsuitable for broadcast.
<P>
"Ah, which material exactly did they find . . ."
<P>
"Well, almost all of it."
<P>
"Bob, they're so obviously jokes."
<P>
Hicks protested that he had run his routine by his sixty-three-year-old
mother in Little Rock, Arkansas, and it passed the test. Morton insisted
that the situation was out of his hands. He offered to set up another
appearance and, according to Hicks, shouldered the blame for not having
spent more time beforehand editing out the hot points."
<P>
"Bob, they're just jokes. I don'twant to be edited by you or anyone else.
Why are people so afraid of jokes?"
<P>
"Bill, you've got to understand our audience."
"Your audience! Your audience is comprised of people, right? Well, I
understand people, being one myself. People are who I play to every night,
Bob. We get along just fine. We taped the show at five-thirty in the
afternoon, and your audience had no problem with the material then. Does
your audience become overly sensitive between the hours of 11:30 P.M. and
12:30 A.M.? And by the way, Bob, when I'm not performing on your show, I'm
a member of the audience of your show. Are you sa~ing my material is not
suitable for me? This doesn't make any sense. Why do you underestimate the
intelligence of your audience?"
<P>
"Bill, it's not our decision."
<P>
Morton apologized to Hicks, explaining that the show had to answer to the
network, and said that he'd reschedule him soon. The conversation ended
soon after that exchange, and in the intervening weeks Hicks has had no
further word, he says, from Morton or Letterman. He has, however, heard
indirectly from the CBS standards-and-practices office. A man who heard an
interview with Hicks on the radio and was outraged over the censorship
wrote to CBS to upbraid the network for not airing Hicks' set. He faxed the
reply from CBS standards-and practices to the radio station, which faxed it
to Hicks' office. "It is true that Bill Hicks was taped that evening and
that his performance did not air," the letter said. "What is inaccurate is
that the deletion of his routine was required by CBS. In fact, although a
CBS Program Practices editor works on that show, the decision was solely
that of the producers of the program who decided to substitute his
performance with that of another comedian. Therefore, your criticism that
CBS censored the program is totally without foundation. Creative judgments
must be made in the course of producing and airing any program and, while
we regret that you disagreed with this one, the producers felt it necessary
and that is not a decision we would override."
<P>
Hicks, who refers to the television set as Lucifer's Dream Box, is now in
Lucifer's Limbo. He can't get the Letterman show to send him a tape of his
performance. He can't get to the bottom of who censored him. And, as yet,
he has no return date on Letterman. I called Robert Morton two weeks ago,
and, when pressed, he finally grasped the nettle. He had begun by saying
that the  decision not to show Hicks' routine was  made jointly by the
Letterman show and CBS and ended up telling me that the producers of the
show were solely responsible. "Ultimately, it was our decision," he said.
"We're the packagers and owners of the program. It's our job to deliver a
finished product to the network."
<P>
"It's been a strange little adventure for Willy," Hicks told me at the
Dominion last year, referring to his American comedy career. And so it has
proved stranger, in fact, than Hicks' most maverick imaginings. The farce
came full circle in the week following the Letterman  debacle. A friend
called Hicks to tell him about a commercial she'd seen during the Letterman
show a pro-life commercial. "The networks are delivering an audience to the
advertisers," Hicks said later. "They showed their hand. They'll continue
to pretend they're a hip talk show. And I'll continue to be me. As Bob
Dylan said, the only way to live outside the law is to be totally honest.
So I will remain lawless."
