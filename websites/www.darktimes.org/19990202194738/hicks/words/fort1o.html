<B>BILL HICKS WILL BE MISSED FOR COURAGEOUS COMIC VOICE</B><BR>
<B>THE FORT LAUDERDALE SUN-SENTINAL, MARCH 4 1994</B><BR>
<I>By Jeff Rusnak. Reprinted without permission.</I>
<P>
On a brisk Saturday night in December, Bill Hicks was talking hopefully about the future,
          even though he knew privately that he was dying. 
<P>
          He was hanging out at the Comedy Corner in West Palm Beach, where Colleen McGarr, one
          of his managers, is the booking coordinator. With his legs propped on the rail in front of him
          Hicks laughed generously at a performance by Carrot Top, a comedian he was usually wont
          to malign. 
<P>
          Hicks, stand-up comedy's rebel with a cause, was energetic and expansive that night as he
          outlined his plans. He wanted to issue a four-CD box set of his recordings, and he was
          excited about a just-completed deal to host The Counts of the Netherworld, a talk show for
          British television. 
<P>
          Outwardly, this inspired comic masked the fact that he wouldn't live to realize either project.
          On Jan. 6, an ailing Hicks played his final show in New York. Two weeks ago the shocking
          news came that he was seriously ill. Saturday, Hicks died of pancreatic cancer in Little Rock,
          Ark., at 32. 
<P>
          I first saw Hicks in August when he tried out new material during a 10-minute set at the
          Comedy Corner. Less than two months earlier he had learned he had cancer, but there was
          no lament in his voice. 
<P>
          Hicks rose mightily from the sea of comic mediocrity that night. He roared at our cultural,
          religious and political hypocrisies in impassioned and ironic tones. 
<P>
          Like a writer or painter, Hicks worked thematically, and put a high price on artistic integrity
          and individual freedom. He had the spirit of a '60s radical, and drew upon the unholy trilogy -
          sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll - for some of his funniest material. 
<P>
          He decried our diminishing intellectual standards. He was merciless on "celebrities" like
          Marky Mark and Vanilla Ice. And he loathed Jay Leno for advertising junk food on
          television. 
<P>
          "Once you start hawking products, you give up all artistic integrity. End of story," Hicks
          declared. 
<P>
          In October, Hicks did a one-hour Comedy Corner show that laid waste to religious
          fundamentalists. It was the same material that got him censored by CBS from the David
          Letterman show on Oct. 1. 
<P>
          "You know what bugs me about (abortion opponents)? If you're so pro-life - don't lock arms
          and block medical clinics. If you're pro-life, lock arms and block cemeteries ... 
<P>
          "I've been traveling a lot lately. I was over in Australia during Easter. It was interesting to
          note they celebrate Easter the same way we do - commemorating the death and resurrection
          of Jesus by telling our children that a giant bunny rabbit ... left chocolate eggs in the night. 
<P>
          "Gee, I wonder why we're messed up as a race. You know, I've read the Bible. Can't find
          the words 'bunny' or 'chocolate' in the whole book." 
<P>
          Hicks appeared on Letterman's show 11 times on NBC, and always struggled with
          producers who wanted to make his material network friendly. It was OK'd for the October
          show on CBS, but given the hook after it was taped before an approving studio audience. 
<P>
          Hicks was told he would be invited back, but he never was. What Hicks wanted most was for
          Letterman, a celebrity he respected, to explain what happened, but Letterman never called. 
<P>
          On Sunday, Hicks will be among five comics up for the American Comedy Awards best male
          stand-up for 1993. The winner was selected by a popular vote on a Comedy Central call-in
          number. Carrot Top will probably win. Hicks should win, but that's really immaterial now. 
<P>
          More importantly, an artist who had the power to enlighten and entertain has been cut off in
          mid-sentence. 
<P>
          "I feel like a big unknown X in this country," Hicks said a few hours before the fated
          Letterman show. "I haven't done anything I want to do. I want to change the world and you
          do that by changing our perceptions." 
<P>
          Hicks produced four CDs, Relentless and Dangerous, and the unreleased Arizona Bay and
          Rant in E Minor. He did two HBO specials, One Night Stand and Revelations. 
<P>
          Hicks was a courageous and necessary voice. He will be missed.
