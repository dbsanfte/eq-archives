<B>Rodney Dangerfield</B> showcases seven of today's funniest
comedians during this comedy special filmed live at Dangerfield's in
New York City. It's a collection of some of today's most outstanding
talent...
<P>
<B>Lenny Clarke</B> is the quintessential stand up comic. He segues
from growing up Catholic to Shiite Moslems without missing a beat or
a laugh.
<P>
<B>Andrew Dice Clay</B> starts his routine with some racy nursery 
rhymes.
<P>
<B>Bill Hicks</B> has some insane advice about cigarette smoking.
<P>
<B>Dom Irrera</B> teaches Italians the finer points of being Italian.
<P>
<B>Carol Leifer</B> shares new insights into the lives of pioneer
women... How did they avoid health clubs?
<P>
<B>Robert Schimmel</B> wants to know why proctologists aren't called
astronauts.
<P>
<B>Barry Sobel's</B> rap routine gives the Beastie Boys a run for
their money.
<P>
At the center of it all Dangerfield keeps things moving with punchy
introductions and his own unforgettable routines.
<P>
This is a group that no one is safe from. They're raunchy and
irreverent... Nothing is too sacred to be funny. Get a hip, hilarious,
very adult, very off-color view of the world from Rodney Dangerfield
and these hot young comedians.
