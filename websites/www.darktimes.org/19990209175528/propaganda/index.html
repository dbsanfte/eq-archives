STATEMENT</strong></font></p>



<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Helvetica">When I had
initially sat down to write out a mission statement for this
particular section of <B>darkimes.org</B>, I had begun by drafting a
list of bullet point objectives that we wished to accomplish with
our web presence...then something occured to me. <em>Who cares?</em>
Really and truly, do you want to read some grocery list of chest
beating and "rebellion"? Of course you don't, and the
last thing I would wish to come of this is for it to come across
as some half-sincere manifesto of catch-phrases and other
assorted jargon. Instead, I'll write what I really feel, and what
I really want.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Helvetica">I want you to
be pissed off... I mean, I want you to be really pissed off. I'm
tired of being angry alone, and I'm tired of people around me
ignoring the crap going on around us. I don't like having my
money pulled from my pocket and being used to fund some
politicians pet project for re-election. I don't want Uncle Sam
telling me what my child can watch, or what I can read. You know
what? It makes me sick to my stomach that the American public can
sit back and watch its government <em><strong>murder</strong></em>
a building full of men, women, and children who were guilty of
nothing more than having "strange" religious beliefs,
and say that it was okay. I'm sick of the government telling
businesses who they can and cannot hire, and I'm sick of a
justice system designed to protect the rich. I'm sick of
Feudalism being passed off as Capitalism and Democracy when in
truth Democracy is a farce.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Helvetica">As more and
more time goes by, the government has grown more and more like a
giant parental figure, spanking our bottoms if we don't do as
they say, and spoon feeding us their beliefs and wants. More and
more lawsuits go to court everyday that make us all seem like
childish little brats fighting in the playroom (and we are),
sueing away while society rots around us. Schools and education
are shit due to overstaffed administrative positions, while good
teachers are being squeezed out. In short, society as a whole is
going to hell, and the people we elect to solve these large-scale
problems throw their patchwork solutions at us to keep us quiet
while they pad their retirement fund. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Helvetica">So, you're
wondering, what exactly is the mission statement, aside from some
incoherent rambling that really hasn't gone anywhere. Well it's
this: I want you to be as pissed off as I am. I want you to be as
annoyed as I am. I want you to be informed, educated, and I want
you to be an opinionated yet open-minded, loud-mouthed slob, just
like I am. Even more importantly, I want you to take what you
learn and harness what you feel, and <em><strong>do something</strong></em>.

<p>Have a nice day.</p>
