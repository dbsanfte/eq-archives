"I thought it was a tragedy about Bill Hicks - did you guys know Bill Hicks? He was a stand-up and I started to see him on tape about two years ago, and I thought, this was
the nearest to Lenny Bruce, only for me funnier than Lenny Bruce, and wicked and black and wise, and this poor chap gets pancreatic cancer
and dies in a few weeks. Three or four weeks, he's dead. And I thought he was a the greatest new comedian I'd seen for a decade."
