<B>IT'S JUST A RIDE</B><BR>
<B>HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, JUNE 17 1994</B><BR>
<I>By Rich Sherwood. Reprinted without permission.</I>
<P>
Those familiar with the talents of the late Bill Hicks -- and particularly those who aren't --
          will do well to tune in to Comedy Central's It's Just a Ride. This one-hour documentary that
          takes a look back at Hicks' unique brand of social comedy and commentary will give you an
          appreciation of his impressive talents. 
<P>
          The project, well conceived and designed by filmmaker Rupert Edwards, is told sans
          narrator or host through interviews with friends, family and associates and a wealth of
          footage gathered from more than a decade of performances. 
<P>
          It's an interesting production, one that's quite sincere and telling in its approach and also
          quite understanding of Hicks' comedy. It's less a look at his life than a salute to his career,
          and along the way it provides a glimpse at what really made him tick. 
<P>
          Hicks, who died in February at the age of 33, was one of those comedians with an incredibly
          loyal following who never found widespread fame -- perhaps because of his humor's biting
          edge. Those who knew him loved his approach and his wit, and after watching this
          eye-opening special you'll probably wish you had discovered him in time. It's not just anyone
          who could bring Jay Leno and Dave Letterman back together, but both deliver testimonials
          here -- along with a handful of other colleagues including Eric Bogosian, Brett Butler,
          Richard Belzer and Jeni -- that seek to explain Hicks' humor and perspective, and the
          importance of his work. Combined with interviews of close friends and family members
          (including his parents), it is able to look behind the laughs in an effort to understand the
          motivations and philosophies that drove him on. 
<P>
          This show is solidly constructed, and does well to capture the spirit, style and humor of
          Hicks. It should have dated the clips and footage to provide chronological perspective, and
          the footage is of varying picture and sound qualities, but they fit together well. As an
          introductory course on Hicks -- and as a tribute to his wit and humor -- this certainly is a
          worthy effort.
