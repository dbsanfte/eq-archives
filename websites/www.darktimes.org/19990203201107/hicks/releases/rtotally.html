<B>TOTALLY BILL HICKS</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="totallycov.jpg">
<P>
The death of the outspoken comedian Bill Hicks in early 94 tragically foreshortened a career in which Hicks had proved himself as one of the most
distinctive voices in the comedy world and was in fact heralded as the Lenny Bruce of his generation. This "Prince of Darkness" was a sex, drugs
and rock 'n' roll comedian, he could be loud and he could be outrageous but on stage he also exposed a creative imagination and a vision of the
world which sometimes took him closer to the role of prophet than comic. Winner of the Edinburgh Festival Critics Award in 1991, Bill was
driven by a distinctive passion in his work, a comedy built on conviction, that set him apart from other stand-ups.

<B>It's Just a Ride</B> [<A HREF="../words/ride.html">transcript</A>]<BR>
is a celebration of the comedy of Bill Hicks. The film is structured around the different strains of comedy in the Hicks stand-up, sampling the
best of his confrontational performance. Interviewees include two major American chat show hosts, David Letterman and Jay Leno, the actor Eric
Bogosian and a wide range of comedians who admired his work including Sean Hughes and Eddie Izzard. There are also anecdotal contributions
from his high school friends and an interview with his parents in which his father opines "I never could understand why he had to use the f-word.
I used to say to him 'Bob Hope doesn't have to use the f-word' - but he didn't like that and he didn't like Bob Hope much either.

<B>Revelations</B> [<A HREF="../words/revel.html">transcript</A>]<BR>
The dark and dangerous stand-up is stalking the Dominion Theatre, London, in his last, live sell out performance on the Revelations tour, 
cloaked in a riding coat and hat. And he is annoyed... You can tell he's in an irritable mood and what's worse, his nerves are shot to pieces
because the comedian who mounted a one-man right to smoke campaign his kicked the habit! This show is like a cathartic exploration of his own anger
and disappointment at the world. Grieving over the death of the American Dream Hicks is building up his verbal firepower to unleash it on
some of the most sensitive wounds of the American psyche, ignorance and bigotry. Able to say what most people daren't even think, his
calculated and through thought-provoking humour has a certain  shock value to it, which grasps the attention of his audience and doesn't let go.
