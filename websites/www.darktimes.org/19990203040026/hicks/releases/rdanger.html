In an era when no-holds-barred comedy is definitely in vogue, it takes a distinct type of performer to become known as one of
the hardest-hitting of them all. Bill Hicks qualifies on all counts and his brand of abrasive humour has made people sit up and
take notice on both sides of the Atlantic, winning him an award at the 1991 Edinburgh Festival.<BR>
Which is not to say that Hicks is an operator whose sole purpose is to shock - he is a thoroughly relaxed performer for whom
subtlety and complexity play a great part in his act and he always gives audiences plenty to think about.<BR>
Hicks is a Southern boy transplanted to New York (born in Georgia, raised in Texas, toughened up in the Big Apple) who
started to write and perform comedy in his early teens. He has paid his dues on the enormous American club comedy circuit
and is now more than ready for the large-scale success which is coming to him.<BR>
Bill Hicks may be best known as an abrasive social commentator, but his biggest asset is the way he mixes the completely silly
with the searingly political. His is a wide comic brush stroke which paints laughs onto the broadest range of subjects - from
making fun of insignificant pop idols to hilarious insights on major issues like drug culture and personal freedom.<BR>
It's this combination of personal and global politics with a passionate, unique insight which has invited comparisons with the
late, great Lenny Bruce. Make up your own mind.<BR>

The material on this tape was recorded on a couple of nights at two leading New York comedy clubs (Village Gate and
Caroline's at the Seaport). Sit back and enjoy a top notch comedian in excellent form.
