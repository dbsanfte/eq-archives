<B>BILL HICKS: THE NEXT BIG THING?</B><BR>
<B>NEWSDAY, SEPTEMBER 26 1990</B><BR>
<I>By David Friedman. Reprinted without permission.</I>
<P>
You needn't be an architect to have a sense of place. Take comic Bill Hicks, who's opening a
          two-night stand this evening at Caroline's at the South Street Seaport. 
<P>
          "Just got off the road," he says. "My Flying Saucer Tour. Like flying saucers, I've been
          appearing in small Southern towns." 
<P>
          Geez, what a crowd. 
<P>
          "In our troubled world, you hear a lot of folks calling for revolution. Down south," Hicks
          says, "they're calling for evolution. 'WE WANT OUR THUMBS!!' " 
<P>
          Which isn't to say Homo sapiens has reached its apotheosis in New York, either. Especially
          when the subject is smoking. 
<P>
          "I just love it when a health nut challenges my right to smoke here," says Hicks, a
          two-pack-a-day man and proud of it. "This guy is standing ankle-deep in dog links, straddling
          a dead guy - and my cigarette is screwing up the delicate balance of nature?" 
<P>
          A sense of place is one thing; a sense of timing is even better. And in the comedy world,
          there's a sense that Hicks, a 28-year-old recovering Baptist whom one writer pegged The
          New Lenny Bruce, just might be The Next Big Thing. Just don't expect Hicks to get all bent
          out of shape over it. 
<P>
          "I've been hearing that for 10 years now. It's like the carrot on a stick in front of the old
          mule. I just keep on plowing." 
<P>
          Not that the Lenny Bruce part bothers him. "Actually, I'm flattered. Who wouldn't be?
          Except that there are so many misconceptions about Lenny. That he was dirty, for instance.
          He wasn't. Case closed. He was the father of free-floating, all-natural,
          no-artificial-ingredients, stream-of-consciousness comedy. Plus, he was a social philosopher
          and one hell of a deep thinker. So if people wanna compare me to him - great. I'm just glad
          no one called me The New Gallagher." 
<P>
          For a long time Hicks wanted to be The New Woody Allen - no mean feat for a WASP from
          Texas. "My life changed when I saw What's Up, Pussycat? on the tube when I was 13," he
          says. Soon Hicks was buying Allen's comedy records and stealing his jokes. "I did my first
          stand-up at a church camp talent show back in Houston. I told Woody's joke about being
          breastfed by a woman with falsies. People laughed, then looked at me like I was the
          antichrist." 
<P>
          While still in high school, Hicks starting hanging around Houston comedy clubs - sometimes
          as a patron, sometimes as a performer. Oddly enough, his most vivid memory occurred when
          he was in the audience. 
<P>
          "I was on a date," he says, "when this crazy comic I'd never heard of puts a pair of red
          panties on his head, screams 'Call me Mr. Lonely,' then jumps into the audience and starts
          simulating intercourse with the person he landed on." The jumper is a guy named Sam
          Kinison. The jumpee was Hicks. 
<P>
          A couple of years later, Hicks was sharing time on the Comedy Store stage in Los Angeles
          with the likes of Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Garry Shandling, Andrew Dice Clay and, yes,
          Kinison. "It was easy," he says. "Hell, most of the people in the audience were tourists from
          Houston." Some TV guy even put Hicks in a short-lived sitcom called "Bulba." All this, and
          Hicks wasn't even 18. 
<P>
          Easy? Sure. But fun? Not really. "The comedy biz is like 'Sybil' in reverse," Hicks says.
          "There are 10,000 bodies out there with one personality. Everyone sells out so quickly. I
          realized how naive I was. I also realized I didn't have my own voice yet. So I went back to
          Houston." 
<P>
          When he found his voice, he moved to New York, where he's been living since 1987. "I like
          to think of myself as a sane guy in an insane world. George Bush has an approval rate of 70
          percent? From who? For what? Why don't we just tell the truth? That we're gluttons for oil
          and we're gonna take it. All of it. And don't talk to me about those hostages. Didn't they
          realize working for the CIA could be dangerous? 
<P>
          "Yeah, my act is graphic. Yeah, I use four-letter words. But that doesn't make me dirty.
          Hell, it's like Woody says. Sure, sex is dirty if you're doing it right." 
<P>
          What Hicks really wants to be is the kind of comic he would like. Not a dirty comic. Not a
          political comic. A revolutionary comic. 
<P>
          "Listen, the next revolution is gonna be a revolution of ideas," he says. "A bloodless
          revolution. And if I can take part in it by transforming my own consciousness, then someone
          else's, I'm happy to do it. 
<P>
          "And if that means telling penis jokes, so be it." <BR>
