<B>ANOTHER DEAD HERO</B><BR>
<B>THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE, DECEMBER 1996</B><BR>
<I>By Andy Langer. Reprinted without permission.</I>
<P>
"This is a Bill Hicks interview, not a Tool interview," declares Tool frontman Maynard
          James Keenan over the phone. Although California's progressive metalists have imposed a
          press blackout in order to protect the lyrical integrity of their brand new album, Aenima,
          Keenan has reluctantly made an exception to discuss Bill Hicks. After all, the late,
          Austin-based comedian gets big play on Aenima: several of his routines are sampled, there's
          a painting of him in the CD booklet titled Another Dead Hero, and the disc's back cover inlay
          depicts Hicks' California-in-the-ocean "Arizona Bay" theory. So, while Keenan says Aenima
          isn't a tribute to Hicks, he's fully aware what kind of exposure this highly anticipated album
          should give the late comedian.
<P>
          "[Our fans] will search him out," says Keenan. "That's why we put the picture on the album,
          so they can get a wider idea. It helps people understand where we're coming from as well if
          they can get perspective like that. They'll get Bill's tapes and listen to what he's talking
          about, listen to our album, and then hopefully have enough intellect to make the leap and say
          `I see where the connection is.'"
<P>
          Keenan says his own connection to Hicks originally came the same way most bands find
          musical inspiration -- from tapes someone hands them after a show. "They became a staple
          of the road," he says. By late 1992, after citing the comedian as inspiration on the liner notes
          of Tool's full-length debut, Undertow, Keenan mailed the album to Hicks, followed that up
          with a call, and started a phone dialogue. "He came down to Lollapalooza in Los Angeles and
          introduced the band," Keenan says. "We saw him a couple times after that, talked to him a
          couple times more, and then he decided to check out."
<P>
          Although Keenan says they had almost worked out details for a co-headlining tour just
          before Hick's death in 1994, the mutual admiration society between the
          musician-turned-comedian and the ultra-political singer developed mostly by phone and tape
          exchange.
<P>
          "The music is a catalyst for the ideas," says Keenan, who saw Hicks perform only once, but
          nevertheless owns bootlegged versions of the albums Rykodisc is planning to release. "His
          ideas were what really resonated with us. I think that's what he really liked about us as well
          -- that we were resonating similar concepts. Unity is the philosophical center. Evolution.
          Change. Internally and externally. Individually and globally. That's pretty much the gist of
          his comedy no matter what he was talking about -- music, porno, smoking. Whatever it was,
          it came back to the idea of unity and evolution. Evolving ideas."
<P>
          Initially, finding the ideological middle ground between Hick's painstakingly straightforward
          comedy and Tool's gloom is obscured by the length and depth of Aenima's 77-minute attack.
          Still, the most obvious connection are the Hicks' samples that end Aenima's title cut and
          segue into the album-closing, "Third Eye," a song about the government's war on drugs.
<P>
          "It didn't take too much digging," says Keenan of the sample selection process. "We've
          heard the tapes enough to where when we were coming up with that particular song, dealing
          with that particular medium, it was very simple to pick those particular passages. They
          definitely sum up the idea that's being spoken in that song." 
<P>
          Keenan says further explanation would constitute a Tool interview, but agrees to discuss the
          painting of Hicks on Aenima's CD booklet -- Kevin Willis' portrait of the comedian in a lab
          coat examining a three-eyed alien's leg. "I see Bill Hicks pulling my leg, using the medium
          he used the best to convey his ideas: comedy," he says. 
<P>
          "The message that he's bringing forward in his work is an age-old message. It's been around
          in every major religion and every sub-minor religion. It's all about unity. I just think it's
          important that in his particular demographic he was spreading that idea. That's the important
          thing. We have such a diversity now of media and information dispersal that it's almost like
          each area has to hit its demographic. In Bill's particular demographic, the comedy circuit,
          people need gut laughter relief -- especially since comedians themselves are so tortured.
          People think that comedians are all happy and jovial all the time. No, they're pretty sad
          people, otherwise they wouldn't have gone into this medium. So, he served that purpose in
          that demographic."
<P>
          While Keenan admits Aenima, which chart pundits predict as a sales blockbuster, is his own
          attempt to hit the teenage metal demographic with a message of unity, he says it remains to
          be seen if the Hicks/Tool common ground has limits. "We're speaking the same message,"
          says Keenan, "but in a different language." And although the Tool frontman is saddened by
          losing the comedian's artistic feedback, he's also optimistic about Hicks reaching important
          demographics post-mortem.
<P>
          "If you look at Bill's work and really understand where he's coming from, you start to realize
          he's not really gone, he's just going through a change. Which is what he said throughout his
          entire work.... He's just gone through a change, whatever aspect of him that was, whatever
          part of soul was in that physical form at that time has just changed form... Even in the
          passage when he's talking about the young man on acid realizing all matter is merely energy
          condensed with soil vibration, he says there's no such thing as death," says Keenan,
          paraphrasing one of Aenima's samples. 
<P>
          "I don't think we lost anything. Perhaps his soul decided it was time to check out," Keenan
          concludes. "I think in the particular medium he was working in, it was almost more powerful.
          It will be more powerful and more effective if he's not here. It may be one of those things
          that end up transcending themselves."
