<B>JUST FOR LAUGHS INTERVIEW</B><BR>
<B>1991</B><BR>
<I>By Clive Anderson. Reprinted without permission.</I>
<P>
<I>Bill was interviewed by Clive Anderson for British TV during the 1991 'Just For Laughs' Festival in Montreal,
          Canada. On TV, the interview was shown intercut with film of Bill's performance - consequently the interview
          seems a little disjointed. Here it is anyway: </I>
<P>
          Last year you were a big hit at this festival, weren't you? 
<P>
         <I> I think so, yeah, it went really well. </I>
<P>
          Now you're back, doing a long show, sold out as far as I can tell. Has this been a good year
          between last year's festival and this year's.. have you shot to stardom? 
<P>
         <I> Yeah, it's been a great year, it's been phenomenal. But it's also been, to me.. I
          mean, a continuation, I've not changed or anything, I'm doing the same stuff. It's
          like an oddity, people all of a sudden are like 'Hey, that's really kewl!' Y'know?
          Yeah, well where were you ten years ago, y'know? But, it's cool. It's all happening
          at the right time, and it is.. it's a big coup to come back and do the one man
          show. 'Cause my stuff I think requires a longer time than fifteen minutes. </I>
<P>
          Yeah. Well, we'll illustrate that by showing a 30-second snatch of it. 
<P>
        <I>  Great! [laughs] You'll do everything but the punchline! [English voice] 'You see,
          in a longer set, there's a punchline. It's a laugh. But right now, that's him
          smoking and looking unhealthy.' [smokes, coughs] 'Good evening folks..' [cough] </I>
<P>
          Is there any similarity between your attitudes and stuff, and the writings of someone like PJ
          O'Rourke? Do you respect him... you're curling your lip a bit there... 
<P>
          <I>Nah, he's funny... I'm not into political.. I'm not into political commentary at all.
          So in that regard, no. 'Cause I don't believe in giving these people any credence
          whatsoever, 'cause it's all undeserved. Are we not people, individuals, and who is
          our leader? There is no leader, shut up, let's move on to another... realm. And
          that's where I come from. And it seems rather anarchistic or.. revolutionary,
          rebellious, like you're saying, this attitide, 'errr.. is he a leftist, er..' No! I'm me!
          So remove all your little preconcieved notions, please.. And that's why I can seem
          rather demonic.. 'He has no shame!' </I>
<P>
          Youth culture is supposed to be sex, drugs and rock & roll. Your act is very much sort of..
          oral sex, drugs and violence. Are those the topics that interest you, or.. do they just get the
          immediate responses? 
<P>
         <I> Um, no, they interest me very much so, but I think they also tie into larger issues
          such as freedom of choice, and freedom in general. </I>
<P>
          Yeah. 
<P>
     <I>     Yeah, pretty pompous, I know. You're goin' 'Bill, I did SEE your show..' Well hey,
          what's wrong with sex, drugs and rock & roll, Clive? C'mon! Y'know, people go
          [whiny voice] 'He's cruel, and vicious, and he talks about.. violence, and nyah
          nyah nyah...' Shut up. These same people read Stephen King novels, alright, and
          they come to see me and they're shocked. You know what I mean? It's a
          performance. It's a show. It's theater. Whaddaya do, do you go and see, yknow..
          The Grapes of Wrath and complain 'cause the actors didn't wear shoes? They're
          Okies, they don't have shoes! 'We.. we were really offended..' It's part of the play!
          'Well..' People are idiots. [looks to camera] Cut that. I don't mean that. I'M an
          idiot. </I>
<P>
          The difficulty with stand-up comedy of course is that people think that.. It's just you standing
          there talking, there's no apparent art form, there's no.. 
<P>
         <I> Right. </I>
<P>
          ..it's not a play, it's not a piece of music, it's not a song, it's just you, standing there, saying
          what you feel, so.. That's why people have a very immediate reaction to it. 
<P>
         <I> Right... and it is amazing, the visceral emotions that people get from standup,
          and particularly shows where people are.. sayin' something, they get ANGRY, and
          you're goin'... and what bugs me too though is they get angry before they hear the
          punchline. They don't know which way it's gonna twist... </I>
