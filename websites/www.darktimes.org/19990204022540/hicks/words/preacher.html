<B>A LITTLE DARK POET...</B><BR>
<B>GARTH ENNIS</B><BR>
<I>From Issue #31. Reprinted without permission.</I>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/pcov.gif" align=right>My admiration and respect for Bill Hicks and his work are second to none, and when the opportunity to have him make
an appearance in PREACHER arose, I grabbed it with both hands. This guy was - is - one of my very few true heroes, 
and I'd like to take a little time out here to explain why.
<P>
I've never heard anyone or anything quite like him, before or since. On his recordings, in his live shows (one of which
it was my privilege to see) Bill Hicks told truths and asked questions and gave answers in a way that left me both
grateful and stunned. Grateful, because - as Jesse says in this issue - I was glad <I>someone</I> was there to raise and 
comment on these issues; stunned, because he managed to do so while damn near making me laugh my guts out.

<P>
I can't possibly do the man justice in a few paragraphs - in fact, I couldn't do Bill and his career justice if I wrote 
from now 'til doomsday. Instead, let me recommend you check out his work on tape or CD. Currently available
from Rykodisc are <I>Dangerous, Relentless, Arizona Bay</I> and my personal favourite, <I>Rant in E-Minor</I>. Try 'em, folks.
I very much doubt you'll regret it.
<P>

I should also mention that Bill's mother, Mrs. M. R. Hicks, is a keen collector of articles, letters, reviews and so on
that mention her son. If you're interested, you can reach Mrs. Hicks care of:

In closing, it's been a real treat to add this little PREACHER footnote to Bill's story. Thanks to Mrs. M. R. Hicks, 
to Mr. W. Alan Phillips, to the overworked legal folks at DC, and to David Greenberg at Rykodisc, all of whom 
helped make this possible.
<P>
I cannot recommend Bill Hicks's work highly enough, people. At his heart, I think he came from an earlier time: in
a world of empty sound bites and thirty-second heroes, this is a comedian worth listening to, and a man worth
remembering.<BR>
