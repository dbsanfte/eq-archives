	<p><b>I've read the ramblings, I've seen what you can do with pixels, and now I want one!</b>  

	<p><b>What do I do?</b>
	<p>The process is relatively simple and involves YOU artistically.  First, though, a bit of a disclaimer:  I am an 8-5'er and I do have a real life, so I may not be able to respond to your request immediately.  I am in the process of doing quite a few different works for quite a few people in addition to entertaining myself, but I can promise you I will attack all commissions in the order I receive them.
	<p><b>Step 1:  Who the heck are you?</b>
	<p>I need screenshots!  Giving me a handful of screenshots will really help me get a few ideas about what I can do and what you might want me to do.  I need shots from several angles:  full front, full back, side view, facial close-up, and a picture including any items/weapons/pet/instrument/familiar you wish to appear in the picture with you.
	<p>A fool-proof way to get those pictures to me is to host them on the web yourself and email the links to me.  If that is not possible, send the screenshots to me via email, but ~please~ convert them to jpegs first!  I can guarantee that my mailbox will spit larger images right back out at you with no notice to me.
	<blockquote>Step 1b:  Helping me help you
<p>A poorly lit, poorly taken screenshot is going to produce a poor work of art.  I would recommend taking your screenshots in a bright, uncluttered area such as the Great Divide, Sanctus Seru, or Dawnshroud Peaks.  If you can't see the details you want me to include in any screenshot you send me, guess what?  I can't see them either.  Which brings me to…</blockquote>
	<p><b>Step 2:  And what makes you so special, anyway?</b>
	<p>There's more to a character than hair, skin, and armor.  Is your character tough?  Strong?  Evil?  Flirtatious?  Cowardly?  Drunk?  Does your character have a charming smile?  Crooked teeth?  Battered armor?  Is your character vain?  Have gorgeous hair?
	<p>Along with your images (or links to your images), include in your email to me any details that I need to know to compose the character picture you want.  That means, too, that if you want a detail changed, just let me know.  All you have to do is look at my character and you can see that I was creative with a few details – the hair, for instance.  If you have red gloves, but would rather they be green, all you have to do is ask!  I'm starting from scratch no matter WHAT you want, so it's certainly no trouble to me.  I'm the artist, and you're the one with the request, so my job is to do what you want.
	<p>Eyes.  Eyes are HARD to see in screenshots, so if you want a particular eye color, tell me.
	<p>Also, if you have a pose in mind, send that information along in the email as well.  I don't have any intention of doing a “paladin slaying 50 orcs and screaming in battle-glory” action shot, but if you want your character to be standing, kneeling, sitting, or lounging, I will definitely defer to your wishes!
	<p><b>Step 3:  I'll get back to you</b>
	<p>When I have received your information and screenshots, I will begin work on your character.  That means doing a little research, digging up ideas, waiting for the Muse to strike, and most importantly, communicating with you.  It's fine with me if you trust me to make a decision, but then you'll have to be happy with what I decide!  When we have come to an agreement about how the work is to be done and you have been given a price summary, I will email you my PayPal information and you can expect your work to be completed shortly thereafter.
	<p><b>Step 4:  The arm and the leg</b>
	<p>Here's the basic cost breakdown:
	<p>$35 – This is the cost for one character, any race (though I'm tempted to charge more for iksar and Vah Shir!  They're hard!)
	<p>$25 – This is the cost for each additional character.  If you wish to have more than one character included in the same work, you'll get a slight discount. ; )
	<p>$15 – This is the cost for each pet/familiar posed in the picture with you.
	<p>$10 – This is the cost to have text incorporated into the picture.  I will stylistically add your title, first, last name and guild name (if desired) into the picture at your request.
	<p>$5 – This is the cost to add weapons, bow, or instrument into the picture.  For this fee, I will do up to two weapons OR one bow OR one instrument.
	<p>Smaller Dolls:
	<p>I now have decided to offer smaller “avatar” dolls in addition to my regular larger character portraits.  For $20, I will custom make a small avatar doll that can include up to two weapons, one bow, or one instrument and your character's first name in small text for no additional cost.
	<p><b>Step 5:  Now that it's yours…</b>
	<p>Once you have the entirety of the artwork in your possession, it is yours to display how you choose.  I do require this:  you must NOT alter the original picture in any way.  This is my artwork, and if you want to create your own, I'll be happy to direct you to sites with wonderful tutorials and ideas so you can do it.  With each picture, I include a signature that is not to be removed, moved, or altered.
	<p>If you choose to incorporate my artwork into a signature of some kind, or a larger work, you are welcome to do so as long as you include an appropriate line of text crediting me with the part of the work that is mine.  Size is also an essential part of the work that I do with pixels, so if you want your image to be smaller than my usual work (I won't do larger), let me know beforehand and I will do it.
	<p>If, at any point, you want something about your character to be changed, contact me, and we can discuss how to go about that and if any additional fees will be required.
