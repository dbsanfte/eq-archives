I would now give thanks to his majesty's patience for if it were not for his orders, you and every other disrespectful worm to slither across our camps would be destroyed without second thought or glance. <br>

I've been told that the war will affect everyone whether they wish it or not. The friend who first told me about all this has left Kunark saying it will become very unstable. (have I said this already?) He's not the type who is timid either.<br>
He mentioned something about it lasting 8 days but he wasn't sure when it was supposed to start.<br>

They conned red to me at 22. <br>
Very little experience, a little coin, but not much, and no faction change mentioned but requiring coordination and lots of nuking along with Resist Magic. Don't know if it would be the adventure you guys are looking for. <br>
There was one that was much harder than the others, don't remember his name. He wasn't an Apprentice but had an odd name. It took much more to get him. We originally let another pair take him on first and he killed their bard (within seconds) who tried to kite him. And the one with the pet... the pet seemed tougher. They were Harmonyed and then taken on one by one.<br>
But once they were killed, they didn't pop back... and finally everyone got tired of waiting and they went to hunt Shadowed Men while I went to bed.<br>
I looked this morning, they have made a mention of them on the EQAtlas map but are not showing up as bestiary on either the Atlas or Everlore.<br>

<br>
<br>
From the Journal of Dorvias N`Keth...<br>
<br>
                     Innoruuk preserve me for my hate grows stronger still this day. Blasted Mistmoore, always with his foul nose in that which<br>
                     does not concern him. Teir`Dal he may have been but that was long, long ago. He has grown arrogant and no longer swears<br>
                     fealty to Innoruuk or any other. The Bloodmoon was mine to protect, mine to care for! However... he is a powerful ally. His<br>
                     &quot;help&quot; is neither needed nor welcomed but I do not doubt his ability to keep the stone safe. It may be that we loyal to hate might<br>
                     benefit from his allegiance in the future, so I do not wish to count him as enemy. He may watch over the stone for the time<br>
                     being, it might even serve to further complicate matters for the bastard Lanys T`Vyl, so I shall leave it be.<br>
<br>
                     The Ring of Scale becomes a whole new concern. If the fool dragon Irin`ka Set was to be believed, then Trakanon's aid may<br>
                     soon be required, I don't care what Ashteth believes. Trakanon can be controlled; he has worldly desires and so can be<br>
                     manipulated. Further, his fury at the Ring of Scale itself will ensure his loyalty to our cause. It is Trakanon who might tip the<br>
                     scales in our favor when all is said and done... and perhaps as an added reward for all of my time invested, he might just do<br>
                     the thing that Irin`Ka Set failed to do- kill Zavo`Zatanov. Her arrogance and stubbornness will not go forgotten. It is only a fool<br>
                     that works against the will of Innoruuk, and there is no room in this world for the foolish.<br>
<br>
                     What comes next should be interesting indeed. I have made no friends in the Ring of Scale and may very well find myself at<br>
                     their doorstep soon. This is yet another reason to retain the good graces of Mistmoore. I have never fully learned the<br>
                     inspiration of his silent war with the dragons, but if it may be used to the benefit of Innoruuk then so be it. The bastard child<br>
                     Lanys will not succeed in rebuilding Malevolence. That is the bottom line. That is the will of Innoruuk himself, and so shall it be<br>
                     no matter the cost. <p>Gorte McGinty<BR>

<br>
Basically, we got a power struggle going on here amongst the Dark Elf factions.  I've read some of it and just can't remember all the details off the top of my head, but Lanys T'Vyl is the bastard child and (was) the avatar of the god Innoruk.  Daddy's not been happy with his daughter of late, and daughter seems to be behaving as a teenager.<br>
<br>
So, without having all the precise details, this ought to make for one heckuva family fight! <p>Malinki Nuikila<BR>

<br>
<br>
Greetings all!<br>
First, thanks Muse for one of the best EQ sites on the net!<br>
<br>
Now on to Befallen!<br>
<br>
Have you all noticed the increase in GM events across the servers? If you have, and have been following the story, then you know that Lanys T'vyl, the FORMER chosen of Innoruk is on the outs with the big guy, and a NEW chosen has taken her place.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for Neriak, Lanys swiped the new chosen from under thier noses, and is attempting to re-assemble the dark Staff Malevolence. The King of Neriak is a bit peeved, but the Queen is on Lanys' side.<br>
<br>
Now, before ye all go dumpung on befallen, let me tell you who ye will find imprisoned at the bottom. Yep, the NEW chosen, shackled by Lanys and guarded by her followers! The key to release her doesn't seem to drop.<br>
<br>
As ye crawl the new dungeon, ye may be lucky enough to loot a no drop &quot;Sigil of T'vil&quot; from the dark elves in there. They come in various flavors (Bronze and Platinum so far) and may be used for a quest.<br>
<br>
Also, if ye care to hail the new dark elves camped in West Commons, you may be surprised to learn that they are from the King of Neriaks Army!<br>
<br>
Could we be building up to a mojor conflict here? Lets all say it together *Kithicor*<br>
<br>
Now, for those that don't care about RP or the EQ story, this may be a change that changes thier levelling strategy for alts, but it DOES offer new Phat Lewtz, and some nice ones have already been found down deep.<br>
<br>
So, in my opinion (I know, I know) Verant has been stepping up the GM events (the EQ Story) and modifying zones (Runnyeye, Lesser Faydark, Befallen) to add a bit more dynamic content to the game in support of the story. This is a good thing!<br>
<br>
I am but a wimpy level 16 Paladin on Druzzil Ro (Other chars on other servers, and not a Newb) and I went in there last night, 2 bubs from 16, and after a few hours had my level and picked up 20 plat in coin, Bronze and Fine steel.<br>
<br>
A respectable haul, and non stop action!<br>
<br>
Bravo Verant!<br>
