They stood blinking at the sun on the untouched snow. They blinked again when they saw Ardrutha, standing in her leathers and not her green kilt, a winsome child on her hip. The child alternately played with the bells and Ardrutha’s glimmering braids. Ardrutha herself looked worried when she wasn’t smiling down at the child.  <br>
        After Ardrutha had told her story, everyone agreed that the babe must be looked after with best care possible. Because of her magical origin, she was put in the shamans’ care instead of being fostered to some cottager. The shamans decided not to name the girl. They were frightened of misnaming her and angering the power that put her in that miraculous spring meadow. Better to wait, and let the girl discover her own name when she came into her adulthood.  So, everyone called her “the baby,” and when she was old enough to be addressed herself, or called, she was called Spring, for the flowers she had been found with. <br>
         The first true decision was whether or not to proceed with the ceremony of protection. The most vocal proponent for proceeding with the ceremony was Ardrutha herself. Sitting in the shaman’s hall, she argued eloquently of the need for protection. She feared for the safety of Halas, though no incursions had occurred in recent memory. But then the oldest warrior, Frinth, spoke of the strength of the town’s warriors. He hated the idea that Ardrutha sacrifice herself when the magic so clearly spoke of easy times to come. Perhaps they would take Permafrost Keep once and for all.  Then they would be able to expand and settle large stretches of the tundra from a fortified position. Why, within a decade, they might be able to finally rid the gnolls from Blackburrow. Trade with Qeynos would be easy then, and riches would flow into Halas. The Northmen would rule the world from their comfortable seat at Halas.<br>
        Ardrutha sighed as she felt the crowd fall into Frinth’s daydreams. She tousled Spring’s hair, and made a game of carefully examining each piece of dirt Spring picked up from the floor to show her. The child was still naked, happy and warm though the others in the room shivered as a night wind began to blow. At least, thought Ardrutha, I may get to watch you grow a bit before I need leave this world. She picked Spring up, and snuggled her warmth to her chest. Spring cooed and grabbed a braid. As a young shaman brought in ale and bread and meat, the others began planning the first of a series of raids to bring Permafrost to its knees. Ardrutha took a trencher of meat and bread, and took Spring with her to room and fed her there. Ardrutha realized then how tired she was herself, and as she lay down Spring crawled next to her and fell quickly to sleep. <br>
<br>
                        **********************************<br>
<br>
        Although Ardrutha thought she would not be much longer in the world when she found Spring, she did share all of Spring’s childhood with her. Indeed, she was Spring’s main caretaker, the one Spring cuddled with most often at night. The job seemed to revive Ardrutha physically somehow and she felt stronger than she had felt in years.  She suspected that this had everything to do with her close physical contact with the child. Spring was a delight to touch. She was always slightly warm, and seemed to be able to nestle into a hug so that pain fled away, pain both in the body and in the heart. She always seemed to be near at hand when there was someone hurting. Often shamans housed warriors with grievous wounds. Spring would hold their hands, and look into their eyes. Her own eyes held the light of humor and springtime, and helped revive them.<br>
         Though some villagers complained that Spring was as cuddly as a little woodelf, and turning them all into sentimental woodelves as well, no one could resist her in person. She seemed otherwise an unremarkable child. Ardrutha noticed though, that since Spring had come to live with them, they had not lost one woman or child to birthing. Not even one baby presented itself butt first. The younger shamans had no practice attending a difficult birth, even though there were more children in Halas than anyone could remember.  On all but the bitterest days, the town was filled with young voices calling to each other, and laughing.<br>
        Spring grew, straight and tall. Her hair soon reached her waist, a red-gold waterfall. She spent her days doing small favors for the shamans, running errands or chopping roots. She began no formal training with them, and did not seem curious to learn any of the art that surrounded her. She spent all of her free time watching the warriors practice their sparring with each other. From the time she had been in Halas for three years, and was herself to anyone’s best guess about four and a half years old herself, she began practicing warrior craft herself. With a sturdy stick in hand, she would stand at the edge of the dusty battle ground, and copy the warriors’ movements. <br>
        She seemed not to connect the art of war with those wounded in the shaman hall. She paid no attention to the shaman’s laments of warriors running off less than half healed into the next battle, falling, because they had not listened to their shaman’s warning that his magical power was gone, no more healing could be had.Instead, she looked up at each warrior’s face in adoration, trailing at the heels of fighters just come back to Halas, lapping up their stories like a kitten would milk. She adored their laughter, their drunkenness, and their light-hearted accounts of horrible battles. The warriors loved to unpack their bags in front of her, as her face showed undisguised greed and admiration for all the trinkets and treasures they collected on their travels. <br>
        From the time she was around six years old, she had a special friendship and affection for the warrior Breon. Like Spring, he was tall and gold complected, and always ready for merriment. His voice was at odds with his appearance, for he had taken a hard hit to his voicebox and it left his voice crow-like. At that time, he was nearly twenty years old himself, and just setting out on his first sorties for Halas. He always remembered Spring on his trips, and brought her souvenirs when he returned to Halas from his journeying. She delighted in each thing he brought her. Once, while she was still small, he adorned her with so many ice-goblin necklaces she couldn’t see over the top of the stack they made round her neck. Breathless, she would say “And you have another for me?” He would answer, “Yes,” solemnly, in his harsh voice, and place another on her neck. By the time he had finished decorating her, the whole of Halas had come to watch the two of them at their play.  As they both got older, his gifts were less extravagant but more valuable. The most precious to Spring was the pearl he brought her back from the bird city, when she was ten. She sewed it in to the edge of her tunic where she could touch it often, each time offering a small prayer for Breon’s safety.<br>
        During the fourteenth year since Ardrutha found Spring, portents for a seven-day storm were seen again. Ardrutha was still prepared to die for the people of Halas, and considered herself blessed to have lived these extra years. She knew now that no harm had come of postponing the ceremony of protection. Halas was thriving.  Ardrutha had delighted in watching Spring’s growth, although she was sad that the girl was about to embark on the warriors’ path. Spring sparred regularly with warriors visiting Halas, and had become quite deft at wielding both one handed and two handed swords. Ardrutha also worried how Spring would react to her own imminent death. Her efforts to explain the ceremony to Spring always ended with Spring shouting, “But I will protect Halas with my sword! You deserve to die in your own time, on your own pallet!” <br>
        In the days before the storm, and during the storm itself Spring seemed to regain some equilibrium. Ardrutha suspected that the trick she had decided to play, for Spring’s sake, had worked. She had asked two of the younger shamans, who specialized in treating disease, to talk about how lucky Ardrutha would be to be killed quickly before her wasting disease overtook her. Of course, Ardrutha had no wasting disease. The thought that this death would cause Ardrutha less suffering eased Spring’s mind.  It was worth the small untruth.<br>
        Spring watched the ceremony of protection dry-eyed. She had begged, and been granted, the privilege of being the one Ardrutha gave the iceflowers to at the ceremony. She gave Ardrutha her last kisses. She also helped to light the bier, and later to make the bricks. <br>
        After the ceremony, Spring for the first time seemed to distance herself from the others of the town. She spent many hours alone, wandering ice-fields and relentlessly practicing her swordsmanship. She began to only speak when spoken to. Many thought this was entirelydue to Ardrutha’s absence, but some gossiped about the difficulties of growing into womanhood. Spring could have had any boy she chose as suitor, but was never more than kind or polite to anyone in Halas. <br>
        At about this time, Breon returned home from a long campaign in the south. He was weary, and his face showed a new scar, and many new lines of fatigue and worry. He stowed his gear in a cottage shared by warriors and headed to McQuaid’s. He chose a comfortable table by the fire, and sat staring into its depths.<br>
        When she heard he had returned, Spring ran to McQuaid’s to join him. She walked in to the dark room, and everyone there noticed that for the first time in weeks she looked like herself. Spring was glowing with love.<br>
         As soon as she sat down next to Breon, he said “’Fraid I dont have anything for you this time, dear. Barely escaped with my own life.” <br>
        “You don’t need to bring me things to make me happy,” she said simply. After a breath she added, “ I am glad just to be with you. It’s been horrible to be trapped here since they killed Ardrutha.” her eyes were dry, but her voice sounded bitter and sad. He turned to look at her, and clasped her hand in his.<br>
        “Why? why has it been horrible? Tell me, little one, have they been mistreating you since she’s been gone?” Breon had long  feared this for her, that the town would  shun her, afraid of a blossoming of the unexplained magic that surrounded her discovery. Unexplained magic that might be her birthright. Ardrutha had held more weight in Halas than any other person, and her love for Spring was well known. With Ardrutha gone, folk that had held their silence for long years might now speak, or plot in secret.<br>
        But Spring shook her head slowly. “No, everyone has remained kind to me. I am the one who is changed.” She paused, hiding her eyes from him to stare at the runes etched on the table. Her voice lower, she went on. “I cannot look at them anymore. She died to save them. She chose to die. I think the healers didn’t heal her wasting disease so that pain would drive her to it.” <br>
        Now she sought his eyes.  “Why did she need to die, when we could protect the whole of Halas with our swords.  You are the only one I can look at, you choose to protect yourself.”<br>
        Breon looked at her for a long time before he answered. Other patrons had been leaving, and the room was still except for the occasional pop and crack of the logs on the fire.  He weighed his words carefully. “We all choose our own sacrifices, love. Each path has its own demands, its own choices. It took me some seasons also to honor the path of the shaman equally with that of the warrior. Time and again I saw them use their own blood and spirit, cannibalizing their strength over and over, to ensure the safety of fighters. Fighters, who might not be quick enough to help if the shaman were attacked by some other deadly creature. As we warriors put our bodies in the path of danger, so the shaman puts their soul. Ardrutha was a good shaman. She worked always for good, always for justice.”<br>
        She wept silently then, looking into the fire instead of at him. “I suppose you are right. I will work to protect them too, with my own might until my breath leaves me.” Spring looked up into his face then. “I will fight for justice too, as Ardrutha did.”<br>
        Breon smiled at her and held both of her hands. The firelight lit her long red hair with sparks and glints. He noticed the calluses on her hands from her years of practice, although the rest of her looked soft and warm. Breon knew that he could have asked anything of her then, but did not. He would not seduce someone he had played with when she was a child. He delighted in looking at her for a moment more, almost wavering. She’s so vital, so alive, he thought. <br>
        Abruptly he stood. “I am quite weary, and suppose you are too. You should seek your pallet.” He saw her confusion at his gruffness, and added “Seek me out tomorrow when I am rested little one. On the field. I have some new tricks to teach you.” He turned quickly, before he could change his mind, and walked away.<br>
        Spring left also, then, to walk back to the shaman hall under a myriad of distant stars. <br>
                        ******************************************<br>
        All of Halas noticed that Spring’s temperament became happy and placid now that Breon was returned. They spent almost all of their daylight hours together on the practice field, Breon teaching Spring fighting techniques he had learned through long practice. Spring surprised him with some intuitive and innovative moves she’d discovered in her long days of practice. Nights, Breon protested age and tiredness and fled from Spring, so his resolve would not be tempted. The town folk assumed they were spending their nights together, despite Breon’s denials. Everyone thought Breon was a good sport not to brag about his new love, because all the young men in the town were more than half in love with her. Breon was winked at more that week of rest in Halas than he had been in the rest of his life. Spring’s glow seemed to speak more loudly  than all his protests.<br>
        Full summer was on Halas. Some days patches of dirt shown through the snow, and the children played outdoors constantly as the days grew long.  Breon had recovered from his weariness, and felt his skills were sharper than ever before. <br>
        When a new series of sorties against Permafrost were proposed, Breon eagerly signed up to join. The group would harass the goblins, and kill some of their leaders, leaving the goblins without direction. The plan was to attack over a few weeks, first taking the wanderers outside the fort, then making their way through the keep itself. The trickiest part would be to avoid the ice giants roaming nearby, but the giants had notoriously bad sight. The party could sneak quickly past them.  <br>
        The town assembled by the well to wish the group goodluck. Spring stood on the edge of the clearing, eyes squinted shut against the bright noon light. Those about to fight stood stern and glorious in their shining armor, as the shamans who would remain in Halas bestowed blessing after blessing upon them.  After the blessings had finished, Spring dashed through the townsfolk to Breon’s side. She grabbed his hand, and he turned toward her. They stood still, a moment, until Spring grabbed the back of his helm and pulled his face toward hers so she could kiss him. <br>
        At first, Breon held back.  He remember the little girl watching him unload his bags when he came home from his early journeys. He remembered her laughing, dancing. He thought of other women he had enjoyed but never chosen to woo. Then he thought of Spring on the practice field, strong and sweating, besting him sometimes. The woman Spring, he told himself. He put his arms around her, pulled her to him and kissed her. <br>
        Breon’s friends whooped and laughed as the couple kissed. Other girls in the village sighed, though not for the loss of Breon as a potential suitor. Finally, with Spring spoken for, some heads could turn in their direction. <br>
When Breon and Spring broke apart, they said nothing to each other, but held hands and looked at each other. “I’ll be back soon.” Breon finally said. He walked away without looking back. Spring stayed there, frozen, watching him go. <br>
        For both Breon and Spring, their kiss in public had been a declaration of  betrothal. Breon, now leading the party heading to Permafrost, had to be reminded not to break into song. A clean joy filled him.  He imagined taking Spring with him on journeys, sharing with her the wonders he had seen before and discovering new lands together. He thought she might quickly equal him in prowess with the sword. Watching her on the practice field, he had decided she was born to the sword as few are.  We will marry, he thought, as soon as I return.<br>
        When Spring broke from her happy trance, she danced the way back to the shamans’ hall. As she frolicked,  the light wind caught her hair and pulled it in halo around her.  After all this time, to feel he cared for her. To know he cared.  Spring blessed the sun, for the warmth of its light on her face.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uisaya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isaya</A> at: 4/8/01 11:23:24 am<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage>The Stage</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
