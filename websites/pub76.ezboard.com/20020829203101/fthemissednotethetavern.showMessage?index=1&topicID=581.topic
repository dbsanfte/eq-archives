The road ran straight for her but the future was misted as if a great uncertainty was about her.  What did Rodcet Nife require of her she wondered?<br>
<br>
With a sigh of relief her mind makes a quick decision and she turns along the path and heads for the note, knowing whatever the future holds for her that now is the time to relax and give her wounds time to heal.  Her body ached and her soul was crying silently within for rest and the trail wound leisurely up the side of a stream.  Not far from the main path she left she looks up and there stands the inn with inviting signs of life.<br>
<br>
As she neared a large troll opens the larger of the two doors and strolls out and she nods a greeting to him as she slips in the open door.  Scanning the room it is much as she left it and a sense of coming home flows through her very essense, as her eyes come to rest on a familiar figure sitting quietly in a corner, a corner she herself would chose at this juncture in her life.<br>
<br>
Keeping her cloak wrapped around her and her hood up around her face with only the emblem of a High Priestess of Rodcet Nife visiable to those around her she makes her way to the back table.<br>
<br>
"Hello Ranger, mind if a tired healer shares your table and perhaps a drink?", her eyes flash wearily towards Radgen but with a sign of mirth in them.<br>

<br>
&quot;I am not sure how good my company will be, but you are welcome to join me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pulling the other chair with his other hand and then turned to order more drink. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Her hair was bound tightly back and wrapped in leather to keep it from her eyes.  Her eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep and her lips were dry from dehydration, "Just some wine for me dear."<br>
<br>
Then closing her eyes she let the sounds of the room engulf her for a moment, like gently waves of refreshing nourishment for her soul. <p>Lodach Trueheart, High Priestess Of Rodcet Nife<BR>

It was worn and ragged but the paper itself was strangly smooth, even though her mind didn't realize that she was brushing her fingers over it her, Lodach's soul was deeply aware.<br>
<br>
A loud crash and the sudden feeling of cool liquid splattering over her sent her jumping as the waitress tripped and spilled the drinks Radgen had ordered for them all over her.  Gasping in surprise the sudden accident breaks her current chain of thought and she looks up and tries to calm the flustered waitress.<br>
<br>
"I am so sorry, Ma'am, let me get you a towel and the drinks are on the house." the young girl stammered.<br>
<br>
"Hush it is nothing my clothing needed washing anyways so don't you worry, however if you could arrange with the inn keeper a room for me tonight that would be appreciated.  I have the platinum and if a bath could be prepared in the room for me also in about an hour.  I would be indebted to you,"  Lodach spoke calmly and the girl relaxed.<br>
<br>
"Thank you ma'am, I will bring fresh drinks."<br>
<br>
Lodach turned and looked at Radgen, sighing in resignation at the gleam of humor in his eyes.<br>
<br>
"Well I am glad you find a wine stain on my cloak so amusing, you could have at least of offered help."<br>
<br>
Radgen quietly speaks while a small smirk forms on his lips, "Normally you know me to be more attentive, but you seem to be handling the situation well enough with out me, and anyways I warned you I wasn't good company tonight."<br>
<br>
Lodach sits down with a exhasberated sigh and watches accross the room the young girl prepare her drink and wonders why she looks so familiar to her. <p>Lodach Trueheart, High Priestess Of Rodcet Nife<BR>
