He could not take the silence, could not bare it any longer. The walls around him never ceased to fool his weak and sad mind. Tickling his delicate grip on reality by revealing to him what he could, or could never be. The narrow stone<br>window, his only fragment of hope, still sat on the wall to his right, flickering,<br>revealing the outside... <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Outside, he laughed, was there a diference, really, to where he was now.  Would it all be diferent on the outside. He wished he could remember how to cry. He still lay on the cold stone floor, his head propped rigidly against the wall to his back.  In front of him, in the center of the empty marble like room still sat the rose. The one last ray of hope, his hope, others hope.  His eyes flashed.  Once he had needed others, damn to all who oppose him<br>and burn their disgusting light.  Why could he not cry?   <br><br>His dry fist smashed the ground where he lay, filled with new life from staying idle for such a long time. Yet where it hit was left a trail of dead skin, not even skin anymore. Orian stared at his bloody hand blankly.  There was no pain anymore. He could of laughed, if he could of remembered how.  Each day passed, one after another, inside this confining grey room.  This room with its single, narrow window, revealing the rippling red and silver skies outside<br>and the rose in the center, not too far from his feet, mocking him. Each day that would pass would uselessly add itself to the numbing blur of his lost<br>memories, taking him farther away from the rose and closer into a meaningless void of non-existance.   Thoughts, emotions and memories churned slightly in his mind of blue and white and green days. A sun. A spark. These thoughts merely <br>made him sleepy, so he closed his eyes and went to sleep.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/4/01 10:48:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 2</span><hr size=1> Translucent lights invaded his vision and he awoke.....the rose never let him sleep.  Awaking, his vision was blurred, everything but the flower was blurred, never could the rose become imperfect, not for a second, yet it was dying.  As another pulse of light eminated from hope a single pedal shivered and ever so slowly broke from the stem and gently caressed the ground joining the growing number.  No emotion could describe this, no feeling that mortals can cope with can be explained for what this man felt, when another pedal was lost.  Beyond fear, or pain, beyond hate or sadness.  What was considered sanity had left him long long ago, all he was now was a shell, just absorbing life's death.  Not his own, life's death.   With a cold face and emotionless eyes he gazed about his prison, the window mocking him of something grander than this.  He knew the window never existed, but then again, he questioned what anyone can know right now.  So he saw the window.  With the ever changing mountains recreating the landscape every time he turned his skull.  <br><br>After many more pointless hours of sitting down, his muscles told him he could stay no more.  To move he did not get up, but just fell to his side, giving his muscles a merciful rest.  Cramps spasmed up and through his body.  Saliva spewed from his mouth as his brain convulsed with physical pain.  This he could  handle, this was real.  He embraced it, he embelished it, his mortality was saying hello to him.  And, after<br>many years, the muscles in his face convulsed and his laughter filled the small room.  The new sound hurt his ears, they had closed long ago and were opening as if something he wanted to hear was resounding around him.  He stopped, the flower had pulsed again.  On his side he slowly lifted his head and then quickly dropped it again.  The skin opened and a warm trickle ran down his face.  He did it again, quicker and harder this time.  This time he stayed down, barely able to see and a ringing replacing his laughter.  His mortality kept him.  Slowly the blood mixed with his hair and his vision didn't get better, but <br>slowly disappeared.  He fled into the other side once again........<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffda><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/5/01 2:45:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 3</span><hr size=1> Orian awoke dazed and with a sharp pain in his ribs.  The muffled roar of a harsh low voice bellowed above him. He realized that he was lying in cold mud. Drenching rain pushed down on his back, pressing him deeper into the black. Slowly, as he gathered more of a grip on where he was he forced himself up slowly. His bones ached with sensations of pain that seemed to churn and ripple throughout his whole body, especially his head. He grunted as he tried to move his muscles, which felt like soggy rags. Then he felt a another rock smash into his side, and a tidal wave of quivering and aching fire washed through him. He groaned with the pain as he fell back down splashing into the mud. The voice above him sounded angry and determined. Orian clenched his teeth with the swelling pain, but the more hurting he received, the more he got the sense that nothing around him was real, but extremities of his own insanities. But the pain felt real and it was still there. <br><br>He struggled again to get up, now quicker then before, and managed to get to his knees which wobbled slightly with the weight. His eyes focused and adjusted upon the dark and moonless landscape, smothered with thick rain.  In front of him stood a cold, wet, and stubborn faced man, older then he.  This armored man was at least a foot below his head level, yet Orian didn't seem to care. The smaller man still continued to bark at him, but he chose not to listen. Around him stood a crowd of shadowed others wearing heavy silver and gold armor plates and swords at their sides. <br><br>&quot;Soldiers,&quot; Orian whispered to himself quietly. <br><br>He glanced down at himself, also clad in the<br>same armor. Was any of this really happening, why could he feel pain, why was there others still alive, around him, looking at him? Where was the room, the red land, the mountains, and the Rose. Out of the crowd emerged a soldier wearing slightly more elaborate armor with a tinge of red.  <br><br>&quot;There's nothing more to care with here, get back in formation.&quot; <br><br>The soldier grabbed his shoulder hard and pulled him out of the muddy circle. He looked squarely at Orian with a sharp stare.<br><br>&quot;I will deal with you and your crime later,&quot; he then pushed him into the line and turned to the front of the crowd, &quot;but until then we have to keep moving.&quot; <br><br>With a jolt the crowd started herding forward through the mud again. Orian stood at first, still dazed at what was around him, but gradually his legs started moving with the bumps and pushes from the others around him, and he soon quickened to an equal pace. He looked back curiously, and saw a soldier lying in the singed and smoking mud, the man's armour was ripped to shreds and his blood mixed with the muddy water. The very picture of this man made Orian shudder with wisps of memory, memory that was washed away when he saw the blood on his own hands, his own armor, his own face.  He decided not to ask any more questions, but instead accept where he was, accept his insanity. He lifted his head up, a foot above the tallest man that he could see around him in the darkness. Marching with him were at least a hundred soldiers that he could make out in front and behind him. All marched with the same grudging depression and rhythm of inevitability that he felt. Gradually the muddy land gave way to grass, the grass to trees, and eventually a small forest that sheltered the rain into few refreshing \ drops. Orian looked around blankly staring at the soldiers around him as they marched. One of them turned and lifted an eyebrow at him. <br><br>&quot;Keep your eyes on your feet, and your feet in front of you and the journey will be over in no time.&quot; said the lanky soldier. <br><br>Orian stared blankly around him like he was in some blurred dream. In the far off background he could see massive silhouettes of what he thought were<br>mountains, or giant structures.<br><br>&quot;...the name's Ling, who are you?&quot; said the soldier flatly, but insistently.<br> <br>Slowly Orian turned his head with a frustrated expression. <br><br>&quot;I...I forgot my name when I... forgot who I was.&quot;  <br><br>He turned and blankly gazed at the passing branches overhead. <br><br>&quot;...Tell me why I must march,&quot; he continued to stare. <br><br>Ling looked around hesitantly. <br><br>&quot;What, did getting knocked in the head give you a dose of amnesia?&quot; Orian did not respond, &quot;...we are marching south.&quot;<br>He stared deeply at Orian, expecting a response, &quot;...to join with our western armies.&quot; <br><br>&quot;The...Vontrial...army...&quot; whispered Orian as he felt the dried blood on his breast plate. <br><br>Memories flashed and dissolved. <br><br>&quot;Yes, we are joining in the crusades, to take back the white cities of Lockue, a great portion of our border defending kingdoms from the armies of Thorin.&quot; said Ling quietly. <br><br>&quot;...The Necromancer.&quot; said Orian, gazing into nothing.<br><br>Ling's eyes widened and his mouth almost dropped to the ground as he turned his head towards Orian, <br><br>&quot;Quiet you bloody fool!  You want us all to be killed?&quot; <br> <br>Suddenly the marching line stopped dead, all the heads in front of them turned around. Loud steady clanking feet emerged from the silence moving closer to them from behind. The heads followed. It was another red tinted captain who clanked right by Orian and further down the halted formation. The heads still closely followed. The captain stopped, looked around and waved to someone far off into the blackness. <br><br>&quot;We are only 30 miles from the village of Tokuel, so we will camp here for two hours rest.&quot; he then clanked off further down the lines. <br><br>The formation of soldiers broke off and dispersed into the sparse forest a few feet from the path. They collapsed under trees, or on rocks, or in the cold mud, with only their Armour to keep them warm. Orian looked around, now oddly accepting where he was. The soldiers didn't seem to care about the incident before with the dead soldier. <br><br>Ling tapped his shoulder, &quot;follow...&quot; he motioned as he went into the trees. Orian followed.<br> <br>&quot;Here, we can sleep here tonight.&quot; <br><br>The spot was away from the mud and covered with dry sticks and evergreen, like someone had already camped there. Ling almost immediately dropped to the ground dead asleep. Orian realized he had not felt the sensation of sleep for ages, the Rose, he missed the Rose, he'd spend an eternity in that confining room just to be near it's dying splendor. But none of this could really be real. He was just beyond insane.  He too then lay down not too comfortably on the bed. His eyes smashed closed and before he fell asleep, he thought of the name that he barely remembered... Necromancer... perhaps a forgotten nightmare from another time, when he lived another life. His armor chattered with the thought, as a shiver rippled throughout his body. Or was it the cold. What ever<br>thoughts he had floating around him disappeared when he fell asleep.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/6/01 2:30:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 4</span><hr size=1> Shouts and screams erupted throughout the merciful sleep he was receiving, followed by heat and the smell of burnt flesh.  Acting on instinct Orian leapt to his feet and groggily surveyed the night's camp.  Too much light.  As his vision became clearer he witnessed the forest in front of him ablaze.  Men ran franticly shouting for help and suggestions.  The red enamelled commanders stood atop wooden carts barking orders at the disorganized rabble.  A slight tug at his pant leg immediately drew his attention.<br><br>&quot;What's going on?&quot; whispered a just awoken Ling.  <br><br>Without a word Orian pulled his comrade up from the <br>ground with slight ease and pushed him towards the rabble of scurrying men.  The commanders' blabberings were now being heard.  <br><br>&quot;Quickly now, march north, regroup in Tokuel!  You!  Get those bloody bod......&quot; and that was all that he <br>heard before he drowned him out and ran back to where he slept, Ling followed suite.  <br><br>He quickly gathered his things and began jogging down the path with the majority of the army.  Ling followed close but stayed behind as he began asking questions to the passing soldiers.  He then quickly caught up to Orian.<br><br>&quot;A forest fire.  Lightning struck in the middle of the night and down comes the forest.  Alot of lost lives....&quot;<br><br>He didn't know anyone here, he felt no pain or remorse for their loss.  He turned to Ling and gave a slight frown to show he cared and continued to jog on, heat bathing his back in it's warmth.  The rain continued to beat down on him, and the low base of thunder could now be heard.  Many soldiers fell but were helped back up, everyone looked out for everyone here, the grunts, the insects.  And he was one of them.  Lightning again caressed the sky and lit up the darkened trees, shadows flickered everywhere.  They all kept jogging along at a slow but steady pace, a jumble of worried soldiers scattered and lobbing down a path.  Once or twice Ling slipped but Orian was quick to assist.  The heat and light slowly died to a halt.  The pace slowed back down to a march and horsemen rode up from the rear ranks.  Mumbles and such were heard throughout the couple hundred men.  Jumbled and confused they got back into a formation of sorts and began the march towards the city, no commander was needed for this.  They simply rode aside the soldiers surveying them and answering enquiring questions.  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>Torches began to light as the path became as black as the forest that surrounded it.  All were dreary, denied of much needed sleep and being forced into quick labour was beginning to take it's toll.  Already men were falling due to sickness and still months more to go until their true battle began.  If they survived that long.  Orian blankly stared ahead unlike the others who stared at their feet making sure not to<br>slip on the treacherous terrain.  He looked down and inspected himself, a dent on his breast plate and bits<br>of bone and flesh stuck to the emblem engraved upon it.  His large sword was dull in several places and dents cascaded along the blade.  All blood had already washed off, or was it ever there.  He was sure he had seen it earlier but he no longer trusted his memory.<br><br>&quot;It's called a sword, pointy end goes into the bad guy.&quot; Ling pointed at the blade as he explained.  <br><br>Orian supplied a grin to ease his nervous friend.   Usually the weak and fearful relied on humour.  He sheathed his sword and made a point of not catching Ling the next time he slipped.  Orian slightly snickered at the  thought of Ling covered in mud.  Ling took it as a compliment and chuckled to himself also.<br><br>&quot;How big's the town?&quot;  Orian rasped.<br><br>&quot;Not big enough, we're gonna have to camp outside it.&quot;  Ling replied all too readily.  <br><br>A horse's grunt drew their attention as a commander stared at them with an air of superiority.  <br><br>&quot;Cut the tongue!  We're almost there.&quot;  the big man sneered and then galloped forward to warn another.<br><br>Orian snickered again now picturing that commander covered in mud.  Then he remembered the body he<br>had seen when he awoke.  It was more blood covered than muddy though...<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffda><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/6/01 11:26:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 5</span><hr size=1> The emerging pale light of early sun caressed the hills and mountains.  Mercifully lighting the brushy beaten path that Orian marched through fearfully, off to the side of the main herd. His frantic expression only worsening as he stared at his surroundings, whispering to himself, as if he discovered new terror whichever way he gazed. <br><br>&quot;Calm down Orian, we have nothing to fear from in daylight.&quot; insisted an irritated Ling. <br><br>His hand grabbed Orian's armor plated shoulder and tried to pull him back into the pack of soldiers. Orian simply shrugged him away absent mindedly as he stopped moving all together, and bent down to smell<br>the ground. Memories flashed and dissolved with each dog like sniff, each giving him only a fragmented piece of their entirety. Ling sighed and gave up and just stared as he continued to march away, pretending he had never seen the man. Others began to stop now too, with curious, laughing faces that Orian did not notice. He instead stood up suddenly, but carefully and alert, as if the peaceful air around him could erupt with any rough movement. <br><br>&quot;Corruption.&quot; he whispered to himself. <br><br>The laughing others didn't hear him. A twitch of fearful memories flashed across his smooth face and<br>his searching eyes.  He suddenly calmed and moved to a trot, towards Ling who covered his face, while trying to disappear into the crowd. Orian came up to his original position and Ling pushed  far into someone else's. <br><br>&quot;Ya blind fool, keep your eyes on ya bloody feet.&quot; said a big soldier who shoved a speechless Ling back sprawling into Orian with a series of clanks. <br><br>&quot;Ling, there is no time for your foolishness.&quot; Orian's tone was harsh, and his face was expressionless.<br>&quot;We shouldn't be here.&quot; <br><br>He looked back, then around, his eyes squinting and studying, as if seeing through the thick walls of trees. <br><br>&quot;What do you mean brother?&quot; questioned Ling, also in a sudden serious tone.<br>    <br>&quot;We shouldn't have been traveling so carelessly, without any heed to try and cover our tracks.&quot; Orian squinted with a hint of anger. <br><br>&quot;But the captains said that...&quot; <br><br>&quot;It was no lightning that started that fire back there!&quot; Orian said, almost yelling. <br><br>A few soldiers turned their heads and Ling shrugged them off, Orian didn't seem to notice, and went on more quietly in Lings ear. <br><br>&quot;They have been following our trail brother, I can almost hear them.&quot; <br><br>His eyes stared even deeper into nothing as he backed away from Ling's ear. <br><br>&quot;Who?&quot; said Ling in a more frantic tone as he turned to Orian. <br><br>Just then a horn rang out from the distance, the horde then quickened pace with eager happiness. A tinted captain emerged over the top of a hill in front, with only the morning sunlit sky behind his galloping silhouette. <br><br>&quot;We have reached Tokuel.&quot; he barked, as he his massive figure roared past them. <br><br>The herd moved eagerly forward, and slowly Orian saw more of what was on the other side of the hill. He saw distant blue jagged mountains that eventually crested a green layer of forest. The forest eventually opened<br>and withdrew at Tockuel's borders. Orian's mouth twisted slightly at the sight of the village. The pretty background highlighted it's dirty, grungy and<br>depressing look. The houses were uneven and jagged, and some were even made out of straw. Orian looked at Ling, who didn't seem to mind the obvious appearance of such a village. All Ling saw was women, funny water, bed and he would accept any mere offering. A captain interrupted his thought and came galloping to his side. <br><br>&quot;We will make camp down there,&quot; he pointed, &quot;disperse, and report back for ceremony at sun down.&quot; <br><br>The soldiers charged down the hills, screaming and laughing like a herd of buffalo. <br><br>&quot;Except you,&quot; he pointed at Orian, who didn't appear to mind, &quot;you will come with me.&quot; <br><br>He galloped off and Orian obediently followed. Ling could only shake his head in concern, and then run off screaming with the others.  <br><br>The day went on and the sun had reached the middle of the sky. Afternoon light lit the raised tents and food cooking structures, casting uneven shadows throughout the village. Orian still sat outside the captain's tent, still waiting for his permission to enter. He started to wonder why he kept following orders, why he didn't run off to pursue what he felt deep within. Memories flashed, and he suddenly remembered the Rose, the red mountains and the barren room that called out to him. Was that just a dream?  He felt as if he had always been here, marching with his comrades in what seemed an endless war. An endless march.  He shook off these confused feelings as a specially marked soldier emerged from the tent. <br><br>&quot;Captain Elencrus will see you now.&quot; The soldiers face had a hint of mockery in it, but his discipline tried hard to conceal it. <br><br>Orian entered the tent and was revealed to a formation of four soldiers who stood by either side of the captain, all looked menacingly at him.  Elencrus sat in the middle of the room at a small table, his eyes were calm. The curtains were then shut behind him by two more unseen solders that now stood directly behind him. The captain looked distastefully at Orian, stroking his beardless chin. It was the same man who barked at him in the rain so long ago. He was wearing his leisure garments, and his face hinted at a forbidden fear. He was afraid.  Elencrus shifted his gaze towards his papers. <br><br>&quot;Ok, lets do this quickly,&quot; he said, his eyes falling back on him,<br>&quot;What do you think that we should do with you.&quot; his expression was judging.<br><br>&quot;I don't know what you mean. sir!&quot; <br><br>The Captain looked away slowly, and eyed one of the soldiers to his right. He then gave a long dry sigh, and slowly and calmly put the papers back in their original places, while talking to him mockingly, almost mumbling to himself. <br><br>&quot;You murdered one of our family and expect to still stand on your feet, let alone walk with the elite.&quot;<br><br>Orian tried to speak but the captain did not listen. <br><br>&quot;It doesn't matter if your quarrel with the diseased was a result of his or your hatred, or not, the Vontrial do not kill eachother. And your method of destroying him I still do not quite understand.&quot; his voice became louder and louder until he was standing up and screaming. &quot;I don't know where you learned to kill in that manor, but I do know that it is forbidden in these lands.&quot; <br><br>Orian thundered over the captains voice, <br>&quot;I do not know what your talking about sir!&quot; <br><br>The captain's roar then thundered again over Orian's. <br>&quot;YOU ARE GUILTY AND YOU SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH FOR YOUR UNSPEAKABLE CRIME.&quot; <br><br>With that the captain stepped back, and the four soldiers in formation leapt forth as the two behind him quickly grasped his arms. Orian did not fight but instead stared with a fiery hatred at the captain. <br><br>&quot;You're making a mistake Elencrus.&quot; his voice was raspy from the screaming. <br><br>&quot;Yes, whatever.&quot; said the captain as he took a specially marked sword from his keeping and came closer to Orian. <br><br>&quot;I will enjoy watching you...&quot; <br><br>Suddenly a terrible screeching bellow, sounding like a giant rumbling snake reverberated around the village. Orian thought of a war horn, calling dark hordes to emerge from hiding. Memories flashed and dissolved. <br><br>&quot;Good Light,&quot; said the captain, &quot;that sounds like..&quot; <br><br>It rang again, and Orian quickly grabbed a soldier's sword, swung it in mid air, and plunged it into another ones gut. With the erupted confusion he broke free from the soldier's iron grip, and twisted elegantly around his enemies, now facing them. With the soldiers own sword he hacked and slashed at each of them, almost against his will. The hate controlling his arms in precise deadly swipes that turned life into death with such beautiful ease. All soldiers collapsed and Orian stood there, lightly bleeding around his arms. The Captain stared in terror as another war horn called out.  Orian wanted to leave greatly, the death that he had caused stung his heart like fiery thorns. He started to cry in terror, fear, and anger as he slowly walked towards the captain, his cold eyes staring into nothing. He couldn't control himself, he wanted to run away, but his legs wouldn't stop, his hand wouldn't let go of the sword. The captain, filled with rage, screamed and charged Orian, swiping and moving with ageless experience. But Orian mindlessly blocked and trapped his sword, staring coldly at him, causing the Captain to slowly<br>move back, over-powered. The tears streamed down Orian's unmoving expression, as he backed Elencrus into the corner and cut his throat from ear to ear with the tip of the sword he had stolen.  At the site of the captains falling, breathless carcass, Orian screamed in anger, anger that he couldn't control...his anger.  He then realized that outside men were scurrying and shouting to one another barking orders franticly. <br><br>Orian emerged from the tent with returned calmness. He would never bring himself to think of the tent again. Outside he was surprised to see darkness, black clouds smothered the once blue skies and slight rain emerged from their depths. Another horn wailed in the distance, now close.  He suddenly remembered his fear before with the forest and started running out of the gathering of tents to see more. <br><br>An army had gathered atop all the hills that fed into the village. All around dark figures with dark coloured armor cried out and clashed their silver and night colored swords together. The Vontrial were running back and forth, lighting torches and fortifying defenses. Captains barked orders and assembled mixed units into formations that would meet them. The Vontrial were renowned for their skill and experience with surprise fortification, and all soldiers did their tasks quickly and smoothly. <br><br>In the dark background all that could be seen was red fiery torches, and orange smoke that mixed with the dark like a rippling lake of heat. They were unmoving despite the Vontrial's frantic assembly. Orian saw Ling<br>forming up in ambush formation. His face was calm, but erect with experience that he developed in past battles. The others around him were the same. <br><br>&quot;Orian, quick over here!&quot; Ling motioned to him quickly. <br><br>Orian willingly arrived at his side, the dead soldier's sword in hand. <br><br>&quot;They carry Thorin's mark, this far from their dark country.&quot; <br><br>Orian didn't appear to be listening.  He instead studied the unmoving dark army above, and gripped his<br>sword tightly. <br><br>&quot;So what did the captain say?&quot; questioned Ling in a surprisingly cheerful tone. Orian looked deeply into the fire lit sky, the torches a hundred red eyes staring at him. <br><br>&quot;Never you mind.&quot; he said calmly.      <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/7/01 12:57:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 6</span><hr size=1> Silence overtook the fields.  The armies supply of arrows were destroyed, the fire long past ate them.   All too convenient.  For mere minutes silence overtook the dying fields as all the soldiers, ready in all their formations looked in berevement at eachother.  The dry air echoed the sounds of armour clinking and the scrawl of weapons upon the ground.  <br><br>Then, the great whistling came.  A sound horrid and deranged, it's only purpose to strike fear into the army that became victim to it's barrage.  Only the most elder soldiers of the vast army were prepared.  After the whistling overtook all sound, the veterans screamed in despair to everyone as they instinctively rose their shields and hugged their knees as they touched the ground.  The quick warning was not enough.  The whistling became a deafening screech as men suddenly dropped to the ground, blood pouring from freshly opened wounds.  The vast mass of the army howled in torment and agony as their armour was ripped open and they were jabbed with weapons not meant for death, but for slow agonizing pain.  <br><br>Orian, looked up from the ground.  Without knowing he had instinctively taken up the position so many others had not.  Laying beside him was Ling, shield still strapped to his back.  The whistling ceased and the survivors rose to their feet.  Around them lay a berived and destroyed army, pin pricked like dolls with arrows.  There were so many arrows.  In some cases five had penetrated one man.  Looking down to his left Orian saw that Ling had been pierced in his shoulder.  He was slightly convusling and foaming at his mouth.  His eyes almost bulged out of his head as he tried to raise it and speak, all too soon though his reddened eyes closed.  He still had breath left.  <br><br>Working quickly Orian removed the arrow and applied pressure.  Tossing the arrow to the ground it caught his attention and he glared upon it as he tried to subconciously tend to Ling.  Shaped like a ball of thorns molded into a fine point, it was dripping with blood and a greenish substance that was eminating smoke as it touched the grass.   Everything around the arrow head withered and died.  Hissing in disgust Orian pulled his hands from Ling's shoulder to find his gauntlets of chain melted slightly upon the edge.  Awaking in a fit of agony Ling screamed a name and lay back down.<br><br>&quot;....oh..god... Orian, kiLL ME!!!!!&quot; Ling screamed at the top of his lungs.  <br><br>&quot;We'll need you fool!&quot;  Orian screamed back, not in desperation but in anger.  <br><br>Taking off his gauntlets he used them as cloth and applied pressure once more as blood spewed from the wound once again.  Desperately trying to revive this doomed soldier his attention of the battle had been averted.  He glanced up to the field.  The ones who had not been hit were desperately trying to recover the wounded and killing the hopeless.  The opposing force just stood there, the only sound to be heard was the screams of agony of the Vontrial.  <br><br>&quot;Bastards,&quot; Orian began to murmur to noone in particular, &quot;they're probably getting off on this.  They are playing with us......&quot; <br><br>Orian looked down at his friend, his breath slowly becoming rapid.  He looked back up and began to scream.<br><br>&quot;THEY ARE PLAYING WITH US!!!&quot;  <br><br>The others glanced over at Orian but quickly averted their attention to where it was needed.  Blood spilled from Ling's mouth.  Clumsily Orian reached into his breastplate and removed a small bag.  Ripping open the bag it's contents spilled to the ground.  He grabbed a small white packet and ripped it open.  Salt fell all over Ling's limp body and he poured the rest of it upon the wound.  Picking up a dirty bandage from the bag he wrapped the shoulder steadily and rose up from the ground.  <br><br>Looking around most had already died.  Only few were still breathing, all unconcious.  Searching the corpses something glittering caught his eye.  Leaping over downed bodies and knelt warriors he  reached the object of interest and picked it up.  The looking glass glinted magnificently in the darkened battlefield.  Snatching his eyes to the piece he surveyed the enemy.  Within seconds Orian dropped the  glass shattering it and he desperately began to search the fields for a body shield.  <br><br>&quot;CHARGE, NOW NOW NOW, Prepare your shields!!!&quot;  Orian screamed, his lungs scratching with the effort.<br><br>Bewildered, the confused and battered army abandoned what they were doing and began to follow the madly dashing Orian.  They held shields to their heads and had slung their weapons as they charged up the hill abandoning any formation they may have coceived of before.  All too soon confusion and questions were quenched as the dreaded whistling returned.  Louder than before.  Almost as if with renewed energy the men rushed forward twice as fast as they thought possible.  The battle cries were silenced from the men as the mad dash up the hill stopped.  The whistling had silenced.  And so had the field of wounded.....<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffda><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/7/01 5:56:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 7</span><hr size=1> The dark armies charged forth down the muddy incline like black acid singing the trodden path with mire.   The deafening rumbles of the hoard's thousand or so scampering armored boots enveloped all other noise in chaos. The Vontrial had only enough time to swallow deep before the army collided with them. Orian screamed, with his sword extended into the glorious heavens, as the dark shadows ran on either sides of him, crashing all around him like one defining explosion that constantly remained at its blinding peak. His sword mindlessly clawed and battered blurry shadows that were almost entirely shrouded by night. They came constantly from all around him, some with swords, most with long claws that always managed to scratch him no matter how quickly he hacked away at them. Three shadows crashed in front of him, while one flipped over his shoulder and pierced him in the back with numbing claws. After cutting through the other two creatures, he turned to face his blind attacker while two more swords slashed on either side of him cutting deep into his arms and ribs. He grunted loudly as he dropped his sword, accepting the sudden pain given from a deep scratch to the back of his neck. With fire in his eye Orian quickly turned again and grabbed the other blind attacker with his bare hands, throwing him with incredible strength into another charging sword. Just then five legionnaires came to his aid and quickly hacked his attackers to bits.  Orian jumped to his feet despite his wounds, pain was there, but it didn't bother him. <br><br>&quot;Ling!&quot; he shouted loudly down the hill, though the sound was surely muffled by the chaos. <br><br>&quot;Li...&quot; a shadow with claws leapt on him from behind, scratching him in the back repeatedly while in mid air. <br><br>Before the flailing clump that was Orian hit the ground the attacker was beheaded, and his carcass was used as a projectile for another one wielding a black sword. <br><br>&quot;Ling, call to me!&quot; <br><br>The hordes surrounded him, surrounded his sword that swiftly and mindlessly brought their death, not that they could have been alive anyway. It was becoming apparent to Orian that there was gradually more shadows compared to soldiers, and he had no feeling throughout his body. He did not know if he was mortally wounded or not. The dark army would soon obliterate all of them, there was no use fighting, they were so few, even with the Vontrial's experience.<br> <br>He sadly and slowly let his sword down as he looked up at the tops of the hills that surrounded the village. No one seemed to look at him anymore. He could have been invisible.  A sudden strange wave blanketed over him, over his pain, over his previous thoughts and concerns. The armies around him seem to slow down to a smooth crawling motion, as the sounds of metal and death turned to echoes. The slowly churning shadows moved around him like blurs of swirling black paint, every gray and black armored man having no distinguishable face. Orian felt suddenly very cold and alone, no one around him was real but instead faceless blurs of armour moving so slowly.  He felt some kind of terrible chill that flashed so many memories that he couldn't grasp any real meaning from any.  He looked deeper into the swirling armour, his eyes searching for the answer, which was so close. <br><br>A single clear figure within the mass was standing still, staring back at him. His sword was dropping to his side slowly, and he looked as if he had just noticed Orian as well. His eyes were of no eyes, and what mimicked eyes gazed back with the blank stare of a lifeless doll. A black star was painted around the man's left eye, and it's black light almost made Orian squint. In a  slower motion the shadowed man faraway lifted his hand towards him and smiled. It suddenly felt as if a hand made of a thousand piercing blades and cold slimy centipedes grasped Orian's frail body tightly.  The blades cut into him everywhere, and the bugs slipped off the fingers of the terrible grip and into his mind and body. Memories flashed.   <br><br>Reality suddenly came crashing back as he was hurdled through the sky towards the black figure and smashed in the face by an unseen hand.  Dazedly Orian got back up, again surrounded by the raging battle.  He swiped his sword at the figure that was slowly letting his raised hand fall back to its side. The sword clanked hard against what seemed to be solid air around the figure. Orian screamed as he futilely beat at the black again and again.  The figure's gaze did not once fall from the above where it gazed, unmoving. Orian then realized that others too were staring at the above. There was almost silence for a slim second. <br><br>A fireball the size of a house then crashed into a horde of black creatures, turning them to black and red mush instantly. The Vontrial began to cheer and bang their blood covered weapons together in triumph.  Orian looked up and saw hundreds of distant specks in the storm clearing sky, which now had a sun struggling through the mud. Hundreds of flying figures in the far sky kissed the clouds as they bolted across the above, trailing balls of light that suddenly grew to enormous thundering boulders of fire that smashed the remaining evils to pulp. Orian felt incredible fear from these people in the sky, he didn't know why. Memories flashed<br> again but left nothing. Orian quickly jerked his head back towards the black figure, but nothing was there, only stirred and stained mud. <br><br>&quot;It's the great army of the Sun, they have come to our rescue,&quot; said an anonymous soldier looking towards the sky at the legions of figures as they caressed the sky, flying above and past them.  <br><br>A red tinted captain looked up and stroked his beard talking quietly to himself with a smile on his face,<br>&quot;They must have been on a routine mission that happened to cross our path today.&quot; <br><br>He looked over at a soldier to his right. <br><br>&quot;Call it fate, or luck...give the orders,&quot; he said to soldier, with a grim expression returning, &quot;we have to clean up this mess.&quot;<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/7/01 9:31:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 8</span><hr size=1> Orian swelled with anger, body and veins pulsing as he burst through several soldiers and leapt upon the captain, <br><br>&quot;MESS!!! MESS!!! We are in ruins you fool, our comrades and companions dead and you claim them a duty!??!  A mess?!?!&quot;<br><br>Orian's arm pulsed as he drew it back, ready to strike down upon the bewildered captain, and before the blow was layed out several soldiers tackled Orian to the ground pinning him.<br><br>&quot;Atleast they fought with valor, look at you scum, not even blemished!&quot;  the captain spat in Orian's face.  <br><br>Looking down upon himself he realized the captain spoke truth.  His armour glinted of polish and his reflection could be seen.  Looking about in utter confusion he attempted to retort, but no story seemed reasonable.  The small crowd broke up as several of the riders landed nearby.  Pushing several other soldiers out of the way Orian gained balance upon his feet with ease, his muscles no longer ached.  <br><br>The ground was steaming and the grass was dying.  The enemy was not bleeding, they were melting.  All  vegetation nearby, even several hundred feet beyond the battle began to whither and burn.  Half of the Vontrial army lay there at the bottom of the hill pinpricked like dolls.  Some movement was still evident but it was quickly silenced with a Vontrial blade, putting the weak to rest forever.  Although Ling was quite a ways a way Orian could spot him, propped up upon another corpse so covered in arrows no mortal man could think of surviving.  <br><br>&quot;Poor fool tried to defend others with his bleeding corpse....&quot; Orain muttered under his breath shaking his head.  <br><br>With the absence of the sound of battle the fields took on an eerie silence as the dead were gathered to burn and the equipment was gathered.  Everyone was at steady work except for the lone Orian who still stood there in a daze, shining brightly in the new found sun.  <br><br>Several men tried conversing with him but no reply was ever given so eventually they let him be.  The sun cascaded under the horizon and night blanketed the fields.  Still Orian stood, no water, no food, no movement.  The army was about to assemble within the town, the work was complete and it was almost time to move on again.  More companions attempted to get a response out of Orian but they left him be.  <br><br>&quot;We'll just abandon you!   Coward!&quot; they threatened.  <br><br>They were answered only with harsh silence.  And so the army slowly dispersed around him, they left him for dead.  The men joked about the standing dead man as they passed him by but he did not flinch.  It was the middle of the night, no closer to the passed day or the coming morning, and this is when Orian was truly alone.  No animal stirred in the blackened battle field.  He stood there alone gazing at the moon as the blood continued to soak the ground around him.  Even in night the light of the heavens glinted off his armour.  <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffda><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/01 10:05:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 9</span><hr size=1> The cold gray mist of deep night crept from the soiled lands of the deserted battlefields. It was a silent and lifeless midnight. The Vontrial had all <br>left for some time. Still Orian stared at the rippled soil. The only remnants in the land of the terrible man he saw earlier, the one who attacked him. The strange but familiar creature that had grasped him so <br>mightily almost by will alone and flung him away with no seen hands. The ground where this creature of a man had disappeared was dying more and more as time went by, now its ruin covered half of the battlefield in a putrid black oil like substance. Darker than the night it sparkled in Orian's eyes, speaking in silence more <br>words then could ever be understood in a mortal's lifetime. The Vontrial had left Orian to die alone in an unknown and very strange but familiar land. <br>Where this land was, was not important to him, but when, and how. <br><br>Orian looked at his armour, and fingered the crevices, remembering when they were covered in blood earlier. The blood reminded him of the Rose, the only symbol of existence and time that made any sense to him. Orian realized that if he was ever to be able to survive any longer he must suppress all those memories of the red lands...and the rose. He had to find out where he was, why he was here, and most importantly he had to find out who he was. He looked out across the ruined village. His eyes gazed across the clear still pond that reflected the giant ivory moon as if there were double images dancing along the surface. He gazed across the army camps and the captains hut. Orian wondered where the cocky red captain he had murdered earlier was. Did any one realize that he was dead, was the timing of the dark horde just coincidence? Orian made his way into the Captain's Hut.  The captain's slashed body was missing and all his belongings were taken leaving the room completly bare. Orian pondered thoughtfully. He realized that the other soldiers could have known about his crime. They were all afraid of him. That is why he was not killed in the mud before, when he awoke and found another officer ripped to burnt cinders.  The soldiers and Captains were afraid of him and for some reason the Captain in Red wasn't. Maybe he was testing Orian, to see the monster within for himself. Orian smiled as he looked at his sword. But the Red Captain went too far and the monster erupted. Now the captain is only red. <br><br>When Orian had finally gathered his mind, and made sense of what he could the gray cold light of early morning crept off the grassy hills and into the <br>deep of the ruined village. The sun was red and odd, stretched out over the horizon. As time went by it slowly grew to maturity. With Orian's slightly renewed mind and perception, he was able to appreciate the beauty of this world. The more he appreciated the beauty, the more this world seemed to be real. Eventually, it seemed to Orian that his darkness had been suppressed for the time being. He didn't feel vague with existence anymore.  However, Orian still wanted to find out where he was, when he was, and most <br>importantly who he was. Orian also felt hunger, and thirst. <br><br>He didn't even remember how to eat at first, but that day he made a briefly strung together meal. The experience of taste and pleasure from that taste seemed foreign to him. No matter, he ate on thinking of what to do next, now that the Vontrial had abandoned him. He could go north through the mountains, or east on the main road where the Vontrial were headed, or west through the forest, or back south where he had come. It didn't matter to him. He packed a bag full of things that he thought he would need; rope, cinder, food, water, and some Vontrial weapons. After strapping up, he made his way up one of the <br>wavy long grass hills, out of the dark village deep and into clear unknown territory.<br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usasi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sasi</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://homepages.go.com/~sassyfrass12/albums/album1/images/goldnoteSmCLR.gif  height=35 width=25 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Genial Dictator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/24/01 5:55:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://homepages.go.com/~sassyfrass12/Sasi.gif width=105 height=132></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 9</span><hr size=1> Wow, hon!

The land was green, full of life and beauty.  The only thing corrupting this otherwise perfect landscape was the habitation of man and the battle long past.  He sat down on a nearby rock and unslung the pack from his back.  He sighed as he began to make decisions to himself.  His mind was so scattered it seemed there were hundreds of voices yelling suggestions at him.  Realizing this he contemplated insanity but dismissed it when he noticed that every voice was his.  <br><br>Every time he thought he had a concrete decision, even one as simple as to what direction to walk his eyes would fall back to the battlefield and everything would be forgotten.  Shaking his head vigorously he turned his back to the blackened ground and gazed to the bluish skies.  Off in the distance he could make out small figures zooming here and there. The army of the sun must still be local.  Maybe he should follow their direction.  They represented one of the only signs of hope he's had in this life of memory so far.  They were the closest thing to the rose to him and he loved them for it.  His mind had no reply to the decision and he welcomed the silence for agreement.  He leapt to his feet and slung the pack onto his back again before setting out.  <br><br>Taking the first step towards hope he stopped and clung to his chest.  Upon making that single step his heart had clenched and fear swept over him.  Beads of sweat glided down his forehead as he held the position, fearing to move and provoke more pain.  Something called to him in another direction...but this presence was not friendly.  Confusion mixed with indecision mixed with a newfound lust forced him to take a single step back.  Placing his right foot on the ground again all thoughts of regret flowed out of him.  <br><br>&quot;I am my God, nothing influences my decision but me.  I have decided...&quot; Orian mumbled to himself.  <br><br>He felt satisfied to say it out loud, to deny any other forces in this realm.  Something wished him to go west through the forest.  He knew in his heart that he had nothing to do with this wish but his cluttered mind convinced himself it was his decision.  This slimy feeling of confidence took hold of him once he started west.  <br><br>The hill quickly led into the shadow of the forest.  Passing by the numerous trees he was astounded at the perfection and order all the trees were in.  No brush too difficult to by pass or treacherous ground was present anywhere.  It was almost like the forest was meant to be explored with ease.  Beams of light that poured through the tree tops shone brightly everywhere cutting through the dimmed light of the surroundings.  The beams of light almost looked solid if it wasn't for the small particles of plant and insect that flew through it.  Not many animals wandered the expansive landscape even though the trees looked like they could house an army of creatures.  Most trunks were just a little thicker than Orian's waist but most the trees were millions of years old, almost as old as the rocks that scattered the ground at their roots.  The journey turned pleasant as Orian began to notice the intricate details of everything around him and the perfection of nature.  He seemed out of place in his armour and wielding his weapons.  His footfalls crushed all the small life underneath him and any sign of an animal were quickly dispersed as they'd retreat from his very presence.  Just once he wanted to see what form of life spends its days in such beauty.  His mind drew up several images of what it may be like but he was sure he was no where near the reality.  Orian found his feet and legs never tiring as he journeyed hour after hour in this relentless maze of beauty.  <br><br>After a while he finally encountered movement more signifigant than the wind.  A small brook ran through the forest giving out an angelic cry as the water broke through the small rocks and dirt that was its bed.  Orian no longer felt alone so he sat by the bank of the water.  He removed his gauntlets and began dawdling his hands around the surface of the water.  Small fish and aquatic life flowed with the water down the brook.  Orian just sat there and watched the activities with great interest.  He became so enthralled with the view that he almost missed the sound of a cracked branch from above.  His head snapped upwards only to capture a slight view of something dissapearing behind the trunk of a tree dozens of feet from the ground.  Abandoning the little brook Orian bustled over to the tree where he saw the movement and surrounded it slowly.  Seeing nothing he almost went back to the brook but he heard something else, an audible grunt.  Running to the other side of the tree all he could see was the swinging form of a vine swaying with recent motion.  This was the first time he realized that the treetops were littered with vines of every sort.  When this transition of plantlife had occurred he did not know and made a note to himself to take more care when observing things.  Orian continued to run in the direction of the motion for several more minutes and every time his hints and clues as to where to go grew fainter.  <br><br>After a while he realized he had left his sack by the bank of the brook and rushed back to retrieve it.  Rounding a small grove of trees he looked to the spot in which he once sat and saw nothing but the disturbed soil and the absence of his gear.  <br><br>&quot;CURSE YOU!&quot; Orian screamed to treetops as he smashed his fist into a nearby tree.  <br><br>Upon impact his fist sank in several inches bursting splinters and small pieces of wood everywhere.  He removed his fist and realized the damage he had done to something of such wonder.  The tree would be forever scarred and he knew it.  His fist had layed out a fine crater marking his presence to anyone who wanted it.  He cursed himself again quietly before turning around and continuing to travel through the forest.  Something was with him out here and he had an assumption that it might have something to do with his trouble to make a decision back on the hills.  He almost felt like he was walking into the arms of a blatantly placed trap but he ventured on still.  <br><br>&quot;If there's anything I can still hold onto it's my ignorance...and I'm sure no being wants to take that from me...&quot; he whispered to himself.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/6/01 4:13:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 11</span><hr size=1> The misty forest that Orian walked through was silver blue and refreshingly cold. There was a dim shivering light that evenly highlighted the brush surrounding him, brush that was covered in dark wet paint. The grassy dark land where Orian hiked was soft and coated in a thin layer of green wet mist. In many scattered spots all around him soaked grass and dark soil protruded vertically from the ground. Like volcanoes erupting with life, the giant protruding walls of grass and soil turned to solid granite that shot high into the dark blue haze of the forest above. The granite was not rock but wood, yet its appearance was of granite because of its incredible age and unbelievable scale. Orian could only gape at the massive tree structures that reached out of the ground like giant organic pillars. They were so tall that Orian had to bend his neck almost on top of itself to look. At the top of the forest their highest branches weaved together into infinite black webs, black that was highlighted by the gray sky above them. It was like a church. Everything was still, quiet, and peaceful. The dark ominous trees were great warriors left for all time in this separate universe from the outside. Orian felt he was one of them as well, an ancient being. There was a hidden fire and strength beneath their peaceful outer shells, and he felt the same. There was a shrouded truth inside both of them. Orian had been recently traveling for a few hours now. However in this forest it seemed as if time had slowed and become withered and old, like the trees.  He didnt know if he had been walking for days or just mere minutes. He had never seen so much dark green, silver, blue and black. There was just too much for him to take in. The day walked by from dim morning to sunny bright mid day. The dark blue fogs and wet growth that he had hiked through before had given way to clear texture and dry grass. Orian climbed up a giant slab of fallen rock that was emerging from the ground on an angle. It was covered in green and blue moss. From what he could see the growths around the slab were burnt and twisted. A few trees were broken, yet not fallen. Their trunks were instead only bent. It appeared as if this mountainous slab was at some moment air born in the past. Judging by the moss on its surface it seemed long ago. Orian continued to climb its smooth stairway. Its angle out of the soil was quite steep. Orian felt abruptly cold, as if hatred was trying to sting him with frost from far away. He looked up to the end of the slabs rise. There was a still image of a watching man at the top. A bright silhouette of the sun shown behind him and he was composed of shadow. The black garment he wore swirled twice his figure in the wind to his right like a dark banner. Orian could feel cold twisted eyes staring back at him. Orian blinked as he nicked his foot on a small rock crevice and gently stumbled. When his eyes returned to the rock slabs crown, the cloaked man was gone. Orian squinted at the glaring sun left behind in the figures place. He searched for the shadow but it had vanished completely. As the day went by he saw more and more glimpses of this odd shadow. Each time he saw this figure he felt the same terrible sting of cold hatred, and burning anger from far away. Orian had passed the giant slab of rock for some time now but the land was becoming more filled with crumbs of the same kind. Vast amounts of fragmented pieces were scattered all around him. The stones were white and polished and appeared to have been part of some bigger structure. Orian. Said a whispering voice rustling in the trees. Orian sprung around with sword unsheathed. Leave me alone. Orian answered with fear starting to take him. He knew it was the shadow calling him. In his fearful haste he tripped on a rock and tumbled backwards onto the ground. Orian, who are you looking for? Uttered the whisper faintly. With one hand holding the sword and the other stretched out in futile defense Orian whispered quietly to him self, yet his voice was shaking. I know who you are. The beautiful forest seemed to be hiding something. He knew that the outer shells of the trees were masking a hidden strength and fire. The forests calm unmistakable beauty was a shroud for something beneath. There was a truth hidden within the trees and a truth and fire hidden within Orian as well. He had felt strangely similar to the trees since the beginning of his journey. Orian got up quickly and walked at a quick pace in alarm. He looked left and right with panic. You fool, why are you still hiding from yourself. The voice came from behind now loud and clear. Orian spun to see only forest. What do you mean? He said loudly in frustration that for a moment smothered his fear. There was only silence in reply. Orian slowly turned and walked again. You have forgotten who you are. You are masking your true self. The whisper was barely a sound. Orian laughed a dry empty fearful laugh that sounded like a croak. Who ever you are your petty mind tricks and magic will not hinder me. Orian continued to walk with a renewed confidence in him self, despite the cold hate that surrounded him. The forest looked as beautiful as ever. Orian, called the voice in slight anger, for ages your perception has been too mighty for me to hinder, yet now it appears your mind is gone, meaning your skills are gone. A pity for you, blind fool. Orian stopped walking as he dropped his sword. The air around him grew hot. He looked up with fearful groveling eyes at the above. Wait, Im sorry. He screamed. While he looked at the highest treetops above they abruptly fell from the sky all at once, turning to black liquid. The liquid roared onto the ground like a falling black lake of thick sludge, picking Orian up with the explosive current. The waves of darkness spattered in every direction. He was thrust deep into the depths of the liquid. He flailed his arms wildly as he madly groped for the surface of the black river. The sludge started to harden into solid wood again. Orian madly tried to get to the surface. He managed to get only his small white mouth out of the blackness. He gasped for air as the blackness solidified. He couldnt move what so ever, and the solidified black plaster held his chest from breathing fully. Orian tried to scream but it sounded like a squeak. With all his strength he pushed one arm out of the black plaster, which was damp and cold. There were horrible sounds of screeching and sawing all around him. It sounded like mountains of metal were falling on each other. He managed to slowly pull the rest of his body out of the deep sludge inch by inch. The forest around him was melting. The greens and dark browns were falling down and smearing together. Orian stammered over to a tree. The tree was still beautiful on the outside, so beautiful. Orian smiled as he felt sanity coming back to him. He put both of his hands on the tree bark in front of him. His hands quickly sunk deep into the tree bark as its surface started to liquefy. The insides of the tree were ice cold and slimy. At arms length he was able to stop the sinking and try to pull himself out. As he pulled out his arms, ice cold blood started to ooze out along with him. Orian screamed and yanked his arms out. Out of the tree poured red human organs and charred bones. Pieces of peoples faces oozed out and each broken and gaping face moaned and talked nonsense. Each organ was moving. Orians dark eyes stared wide with silent fear. The fiery air around him was crushing his body so he couldnt even scream. He spun around and looked at his hands. Both of his arms were terribly burnt and most of the flesh had been stripped off. The pain made him want to vomit. With a dry croaking voice he uttered to nothing. What are you doing to me? Orian closed his eyes and curled up on the ground. The pressure and hatred and fire around him stopped. The screeching and sawing died. If he opened his eyes again he would have seen that the forest was normal. It was beautiful once more and solid, as if nothing had ever happened. Orians arms were not burnt, but clean and healthy. The pain was gone. Nothing had happened to Orian. Or it only happened, but in his mind. He was drained in every way a fragile destroyed man could be drained. First he lost his memory, now he was loosing his mind. Without moving, because of fear, Orian fell into a deep black sleep.       <br>   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffda><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malignussunslayer>Malignus Sunslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Recalcitrant Evil</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/6/01 5:23:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 12</span><hr size=1> Fear...pain...anger..cold slowly seeped into his half concious mind.  He was in a basement of sorts, a room made of cold structured stone.  It was completely black and the ground itself torched him even though he knew it was deadly cold.  His armour barely bit back the cold fire temperature of the stone.  He tried to get up and found his ankles and wrists bound by strengthened chains.  Orian tested the strength of his bindings and found it impossible even though his muscles were full of energy.  He slowly stood to his feet and closed his eyes.  His breathing became slow, steady and longer.  Almost entering into a hypnotic state Orian tested the strength of his bindings once again.  His straining muscles kissed the padding of his armour all too tightly and sweat poured forth from his pressured brow.  The chains, now at full slack, stood perfectly horizontal creaking with the tension.  The veins throughout his body popped to the surface and his teeth clenched tighter and tighter beyond the strength of his gums.  Blood began seeping out his lips and his joints began to creak.  After several more minutes of strenuous pressure Orian collapsed to the ground defeated.  His heaving chest rose and fell like the tides and his flushed face slowly but surely paled.  Just as the ringing in his ears ceased they were filled with the light laughter of all the walls around him.  It came from every angle penetrating his skull.  Although it was a light laughter it was constant, and the sound of it drove the absence of hope into his thoughts.    Shaking his mind clear Orian used the wall behind him and stood once again.  The chains held him tightly to the wall allowing only several feet of slack.  Knowing his captivity complete Orian stared about the room in slight curiousity.  It was plane and black, but upon further inspection it was covered with a very fine rune like language.  Or was it just beautious carvings placed there for appeal?   The small runes flowed so finely together Orian assured himself it was a language but one much more complex than he could understand.  He was disturbed at this and began to regularily inspect the writings upon the walls and floor.  Scouring across the section he could reach he noticed it covering every crevice and measurement around the room.  He was surprised that he himself had caught sight of it.  Standing there in awe he had no preparation for the thousands of black insects that began to swirl and fly into the room.  Orian screamed in pain as some flew into a crevice of his armour and bit furiously.  He ended up curling into as best a ball as he could form while chained so viciously.  Eventually the insects began to cluster and slowly they formed a figure standing in the middle of the cell.  After the last insect had taken its place the figure came alive and animate as it flowed the black cape that surrounded the cloaked figure.  The swirl stopped and the black flowing figure stopped as a man in mid bow.  Raising its head the masked man stared deeply into Orian's features.  <br>&quot;Welcome to my temple Orian, you've seen the inside of these many a times...this being my...let us see...twentieth one built since we last met.  You and your blasted kind constantly driving me out.&quot; the masked man uttered as he slowly rose to his standing position.  Orian wished for the return of the insects for this being was angered at him for reasons beyond his comprehension.  The throbbing bites that covered a mass majority of his body swelled fumingly in this man's presence.  The urge to itch almost forced him to remove his armour but was afraid to move and react the wrong way.  The flowing black man ever stared into Orian's eyes and it never changed.  He wanted to be anywhere other than here, even dead.  Keeping the stare of the black man's still Orian slowly reached near his lower back and removed a smallish blade he always keeps.  The small blade glided along the armour protecting his back and the gleam of it filled the room as he drew it to defend himself.  The man's laughter filled Orian's ears as the sound of a blade being unsheathed rang throughout the room.  No movement was evident until the shrouded cloak slowly revealed a blackened sword protruding from it's ever life like presence.  With four quick and precise twitches from the cloaked man and the shackles and chains fell from Orian's limbs.  His sword was lying several feet from where he stood and a blackened hand pointed towards it.  <br>&quot;I witnessed you fighting your superiors and I relish a good fight.  Go on, pick it up!&quot;   WIthout word or response Orian quickly strode over to his sword, threw down the small blade and drew the mighty one.  A gleam of madness formed in Orian's eyes as he remembered what this being had done to him.  The itch was still ever present feeding the rage filled fire that brewed within the giant man.  The two swordsmen stared at eachother for several moments, Orian at full height wielding his sword like the barbarians he once was at war with, the cloaked flowing figure hunched in a strange way wielding the blade behind and away from himself.  The sound of a pebble falling due to the chill wind that ran through the temple cracked and the two forms collided.  Orian swayed and hacked at the swirling blackness that surrounded him, fending off the nearly invisible jabbing thrusts that flung out at him.  The cloaked figure almost danced around the room letting his sword move much slower than Orian's but deflecting and attacking much more often.  No matter how rageful and blind Orian became his madness could not even make the figure flinch.  Finally the swirling cape that surrounded Orian fell to the ground and the man stood still, a few feet from where Orian stood, and pointed his blade at his opponent.<br>&quot;You know not the skills you do not possess my friend, what has happened to you?&quot; the figure sneered.  <br>&quot;Never friend to you...stop your nonsensical babblings.&quot; Orian snapped back.<br>&quot;So you do not remember me Orian?  I have been hunting you for years my friend and you do not remember what I am?  Well let me introduce myself...I am James.&quot;  The cloaked figure than took another bow which provoked his cape to come trailing inwards towards him.  Slowly the large black material dissapeared behind him.  James glanced upwards with a mad gleaming smile on his face.  A drop of sweat glided into Orian's eye and as he blinked it off he spewed forth a mouthful of blood.  James' breath could be felt on the back of his neck and his blade protruded from his armoured stomach.<br>&quot;The blade...do you feel it?  I've placed it beside your liver and one other vital organ.  Don't move too suddenly or you might cut yourself further.  Cuts inside yourself never heal too nicely now do they mortal man?&quot;  The laughter that followed chilled the dying form of Orian and he slowly slid to the ground unable to support his own weight anymore.  His still form curled up as blood flowed from the massive sword wound that pained him on both sides.  The cloaked figure looked down at the grovelling body of Orian and chuckled some more.<br>&quot;Of course I won't let you die!  I would not end an epic long hatred so easily.  Close your eyes now...&quot; and that was all that was heard as darkness crept into his mind from every angle.  No telling how late in time it was Orian regained conciousness for a brief moment to see the bottom of many treetops.  Sight was taken from him several more times until finally he entered a deep sleep unable to worry for his own well being.       <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showPrevMessage?topicID=164.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showNextMessage?topicID=164.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=12><img src=http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/Reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.threadControl?topicID=164.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=164.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=164.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themissednotefrm15">SEE the Missed Note<option value="themissednotethetavern">The Tavern<option value="themissednotethestage">The Stage<option value="themissednotetidbits">Tidbits<option value="themissednotetantrums">Tantrums  <option value="themissednotefrm11">Just for fun!<option value="themissednoteguildlinks">Links<option value="themissednotethepartyforum">The Party Forum<option value="themissednotetradesevents">Trades & Events<option value="themissednotetesting">Testing<option value="themissednotefrm12">Ghost thread</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage>The Stage</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
