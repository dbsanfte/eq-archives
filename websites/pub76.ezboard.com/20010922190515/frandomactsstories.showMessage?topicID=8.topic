It was upon one of these days that I felt like Bristlebane himself was playing some sort of joke on me.  In other words, I felt as if my luck was so good, that I was near invincible.  At one point, I was sitting in the magi room waiting for the next spawn.  After waiting for about 3 minutes and letting my mana regen, a dry bone skeleton poped.  I sighed, knowing full well that this would give me no expieriance ( I believe I was level 33 at the time).  I started out by doing what I always do first, which is rooting the dry bone.  However, about halfway into my casting, I was interrupted by another dry bone skeleton, which had poped right next to me.  I proceeded to root it as well, and happily nuke away at the first dry bone until it had been exterminated.  I then turned my attention to the newer dry bone, who had recently broken free of my root and was proceeding to charge toward me.  As he got up to me, I was confronted by another pop, which turned out to be a barbed bone skeleton.  At this point, I noticed that my health was steadily declining, and was at about 60 percent of full.  After a couple attempts, I managed to root the barbed bone and the dry bone.  I figured I should probably take out the dry bone first, seeing that they're casters.  I nuked it twice, and it broke free of my root.  My next 3 roots were either resisted, or lasted for less than 2 seconds...  I noticed that my health was in a poor condition (at about 5 percent), and decided that my best course of action would be to try and get a nuke off and kill the dry bone.  At about the time when I activated the nuke hotkey, I went unconscious.  One thing I found out that day, is that while you can't do anything while you're unconscious, it doesn't interrupt a spell you're casting.  So I proceeded to cast this spell with the dry bone constantly swinging at me, but miraculously, always missing.  The spell went off, killing the dry bone.  I lay there unconscious while my hp climbed to a positive number, while my root on the barbed bone remained unbroken.  I then healed myself, nuked the barbed 3 times, sat down to med, got back up, and nuked it again, killing him.  This left me completely out of mana, and wondering how I pulled that off. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I've had a couple close ones and some that were too close. =)<br>
<br>
Let's see... some of the more recent ones. First there is Solusek A. Goblins, lots and lots of goblins. They don't like me much, not sure why. =) One day I was running from lavastorm to the &quot;window room&quot; in nagafens lair. The shortcut is through solusek a. I was 35th level at the time and had only been through that way about 2 or 3 times, and always with a guide. This time I started slowly inching my way through and 2 or 3 goblins started shouting and yelling and getting all upset. So, deciding that letting them beat on me was not such a good plan I ran towards my destination. For those of you who are not familiar with the route I'm talking about... at the end you hit a T. If you go left you walk into the champions and solusek goblins. If you go right there's a 5th level goblin there and otherwise a clear path. Biiiig difference. In my haste I missed the turn and went left. Thinking that this wasn't the right way I turned around and noticed that 3 champions and 2 soluseks were charging me! Quickly backtracking I wandered around until finding the exit (back to lavastorm at that point heh). I lunged for the zone and... Loading, Please Wait.<br>
Holding my breath... I popped out into LS! Woohoo! Checked myself... 4 hit points left. =)<br>
<br>
As for too close... well one time in Nagafens Lair (Solusek B) my group got attacked by a lava duct crawler. Nasty spider for any who don't know. My friends and I all being about 35th level knew we couldn't kill it, so we ran for zone. Other than the fact that this spider bites for 90 damage, it has a really nasty DoT called Boiling Blood. We all made it to zone, myself and the rogue in bad shape. After zoning through I quickly dropped a big heal on the rogue (he was near death) and, typical cleric, hadn't been paying attention to my own health... I promptly passed out. Being the only healer in the group, this was a bad spot... unconcsious and dotted with a huge nasty spell. Everyone started bandaging me (was quite funny to watch actually hehe) but alas... it was too late. At least I saved the rogue =) <p>Balamur Stoutfaith<BR>

This has got to be the wierdest thing thats happened to me, a super high level guy made the largest goblin whelp train I've ever seen... At least 50 (After I regained conciousness I asked how long it took to make, he said a little longer then half an hour) Anyways, he had this huge train and I was killing krag Chicks in the newbe zone. He zoned into Kaladim and instantly all those goblins started going after the newbes. At least 10 tagged onto me and plus that Chick started beating me. The Krag was killed when I had a bubble of life left and I could see the guards running like mad to kill all those goblins.  Then I died. No I woke up. No I died. No I woke up! (This happened 8 times, which I have screen shots to prove!) Until finally the guards cleared up the final goblins and all was peacefull. <br>

<br>
      When When My friend Siper was little at  his 5 or 6th season, he had a very close call.  he took on 1 goblin warrior that was at least 1 or 2 seasons older than he with a big staff, Siper began by using his memory to say the magical words of snare, which slowed the goblin, then he called upon nature to help him by changing his skin to wood.  Siper then attacked the goblin warrior with a head on assult.  Siper looked like he was going to kill the warrior with ease for he was missing constantly, the goblin was at 3/4 his original health when he started hitting for some good damage, siper then backed up and called upon nature to aid his quest by hitting the goblin with lightning, unfortunatly the goblin interupted his chants several times. siper was close to death, but the warrior was to, he beat the goblin with his might and got nature to send lightning forth once and this one lightning ended the deed, while Siper was limping back to the guards bloody and battered, he was attacked by the warrior's kin, the goblin was of equal seasons, and started to batter the poor druid without mercy, when a first season cleric lended his aid but this poor druid didnt even get to half his help, the young cleric tried to beat the goblin in desperate help for the druid, for this cleric was Siper's friend.  the goblin turned on the cleric, and Siper couldnt get the goblins attention before the cleric was slain.  With his friend slain and himself near death he fought and fought, in the end he won, and checked his health, he was at 1hp.  he crawled to the guards and collapsed. he was unconcious for some time, but Karana had felt pity for the young cleric that had used his short lived life to save one of his (meaning Karana's) own children at the price of the cleric's own life, so The cleric was reborn.  he bandaged Siper and used his healing words.  In the end was a bond of forever lasting friendship. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ubalamurstoutfaith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balamur Stoutfaith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#006400>(1/21/01 1:55:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bristlebane?</span><hr size=1> *pokes* Who was it!?

I was in an Orc group, and acting as healer. We had a bad pull and my massive healing aggroed the orcs on me. I waited a little to long before running, but made the zone with about half a bub of hp left. After entering Kitchicor I was going to move forward a little bit, but accidentaly hit the wrong key, and backed into HH again. Knowing I had several Orcs waiting for me there I sat with my finger on the forward key, ready to hit it the same moment I entered. I hit it but above the &quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT&quot; message I saw another line too, &quot;An Orc Scout hits you for 33 points of damage&quot; Not knowing my exact hp status it seemed like an eternity before I entered Kitchicor. There was NO red left in the bar and the status screen showed 3 hp left. PHEW!! <p>Kelwan Bearhugger<BR>

I've done that before -- been so glad I escaped from a zone that I hit the wrong arrow key and zoned back in!<br>
<br>
The worst time for it to happen was in the temple of Cazic-Thule.  My group was out in the courtyard, happily killing lizard sentinels, when we noticed there seemed to be a lot of higher-level people running by.  Before we knew it, some higher-level lizards were running by, too!<br>
<br>
We dashed for the zone and barely made it down the hall to the Feerott zone.  Phew!  But there was no rest for the weary -- the horrible Bouncer Hurd appeared in the doorway and started smashing people right and left for double 100 damage!<br>
<br>
I didn't have SoW on because I'd lost my wolf form when I zoned, and I hadn't had the time or mana to cast it on myself, but I made it to the zone with about two bubbles of health (for a druid, that's about 200 hp!).  Just as I appeared in the relatively safe hallway -- the train was shuffling back to their places -- I hit the back arrow key and zoned back into Feerott, where Bouncer Hurd was still waiting!<br>
<br>
I sat there waiting for the game to load, knowing I was going to be druid toast for the Bouncer.  Sure enough, there he was, and he hit me a bunch of times as I held the arrow key down to zone back.  I didn't know if I'd be alive or not.  What seemed like an eternity later, I zoned back in and read my chat screen:<br>
<br>
Bouncer Hurd hits YOU for 98 damage!<br>
Bouncer Hurd kicks YOU for 100 damage!<br>
Bouncer Hurd tries to smash YOU, but misses!<br>

<br>
I was hanging out around orc hill, when I heard a cry for help.  A youngster was being attacked by three orc centurions.  I rushed to his aid, attempting to heal him and at the same time distract the beasts he was fighting.  Alas, I was too late.  He passed from this world, and the foul orcs turned their attentions to me.  My unsuccessful attempts at healing had left me low on mana, so, recognizing that I was in trouble, I turned to run.  A group or two who were sitting on top of the hill picked the orcs off my tail.  I paused briefly to heal myself slightly, for I was greatly injured, when another orc attacked.  I quickly called on Tunare for her aid, which she granted, allowing me the time I needed to run to the guards near Kelethin.  <br>
<br>
It was only at this point that I realized I was still bound in Freeport!  <br>
