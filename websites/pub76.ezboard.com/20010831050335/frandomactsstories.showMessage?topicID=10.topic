(long story)</span><hr size=1> Hello and well met,<br>
   For the longest of tymes i have been searching for a guild such as this. I love it! The idea, it's great to help others.<br>
   Ever since i purchased EverQuest i had been playing on the Xegony server. HAving had around 20 different characters i finally stoped changing and decided to keep my Shaman barbarian for many reasons. I had never leveled passed 11 for one good reason, I would always find myself Role Playing and decide to buff someone with everyhting i had, help out a newbie, or give away 5 longsaxe's to the first 5 people to poke me at a gate as i have done before.<br>
   I really didnt care much for leveling when i felt the graciousness and warmhearted feeling of making a new friend from giving them something or helping them greatly. But then tragedy struct my character.<br>
   I had noticed that mnay higher level Shamans had much better stats than I. When I told them my stats they often told me i need to start a new Shaman becuase being a level 11 Shaman with only 92 wisdom isnt the greatest. So i contacted my friends sadly to hear none of them could come to my aid to transport my stuff to my new charcter. So i left the armor, the money, the wepons all at the bottom of well. But when i came back it was all gone.<br>
           (almost over just hang on)<br>
   Since it had taken me so long to achieve all of that stuff and it had all been lost, i saw no need to still use that Shaman or the server since apparently the people there cared no less for friends or other characters as they did goind to school. I could find no GM t help me, no other player to lend me some items, and no friend to back me up. Sad since i had helped so many and got so little help.<br>
   I then Began looking for a new server to play on, one with generous people and many newbies to help out when needs be. Then I here of this clan on a reletivley new server with apparently many newbies and generous people to probably back me up when hard tymes strike others.<br>
   I would really love to join your clan, though i dont have a character yet on this server i plan to make a Barbarian Shaman named Sallof Spiritstrike. If one of you would reply to this &quot;long&quot; post and tell me whom to contact and when i would be so gratefull.<br>
   Thankyou for reading this &quot;long&quot; post but for some reason felt a need to to write why i want to join the clan, how nice i am, and a little background on myself while playing this social, rat killing, role playing game we all call EverQuest.<br>
   <br>
So as i often to say to players after lending them a hand or having one lent to me:   <br>
       May The God's Smile Upon You Friend,<br>
<br>

(long story)</span><hr size=1> Greetings Sallof!<br>
<br>
I am so glad you found us! We will be most honored to be<br>
your companions on this happy pilgrimage through Norrath!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I was saddened to hear of the terrible things that happened<br>
to you. It is terrible when people who are suppossed to be<br>
your friends mistreat you so badly. I have had similiar things<br>
happen and then I withdrew and suspected everyone. It's not a<br>
good place to be in.<br>
<br>
One thing I try to remember is that even good people can<br>
disappoint you because no one is perfect and we all have good<br>
and bad moments. So although I believe that all of us in this<br>
guild have good intentions, it is inevitable that we will all let<br>
each other down at times. Let's try to forgive each other and<br>
go on please when that happens...I will probably need a lot<br>
of forgiveness and tolerance from everyone.<br>
<br>
But I can promise you that if you ever need someone trustworthy<br>
to help you trade your stuff, either I or Fyrewurkz will be glad to<br>
help you, as I am sure many others in the guild will too. Before<br>
this, Fyre and I were on another server and in a huge guild. He<br>
asked someone in the guild to help him trade his stuff. He gave<br>
the guy his stuff and 50 plat...and the guy said he never got the<br>
50 plat from him. There is no way of telling what happened, but<br>
it looks like the guy took the 50 plat from Fyre. That didn't feel good.<br>
<br>
It's the goal of this guild to practice acts of kindness...not just for<br>
people outside the guild, but for inside the guild too. Kindness<br>
begins at home. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ok...I will get off my soapbox now and go to bed everyone!  :LOL<br>
<br>
Sallof, I will look for you in the game so I can invite you into the guild.<br>
<br>
Good Journey,<br>
Hamadryad Long<br>
<br>
PS Yes when you make your shaman, please put everything you<br>
can into wisdom.<br>
