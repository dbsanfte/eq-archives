<br>
Aganitte is a little behind me in levels due to an extended trip this summer.  I've been trying to help her catch up because I really wanted her to be able to teleport along with me.  <br>
<br>
Yesterday, after the First Aid Camp in Greater Fay, I joined Aganitte in Lake Rathe at the 1K spawn (so-called because the loc is 1000, 1000).  We spent the next several hours grimly killing as many aviak guards as possible.  <br>
<br>
I never understood why people complained about camping until yesterday.  Tunare's teeth!  It was like a factory job or something.  Frankly, I had more fun at a job where I spent the entire day taping boxes shut.  But we had one purpose in mind -- level 19 and teleport spells for Aganitte.<br>
<br>
At last, the long anticipated DING arrived.  We danced for joy, making rude gestures at the remaining aviak guard, then headed for the West Commons druid ring.<br>
<br>
I can teleport there, but I came along for support -- except for the run through Kithcor at night!  I teleported that part, thinking Aganitte must be insane, but she made the run unscathed and bought her teleport spells at the druid ring.<br>
<br>
We then teleported to the North Karana druid ring.  Aganitte bought her new spell rank and sat down to memorize them all.  Five minutes went by, then ten minutes -- dum de dum.  Finally, she was ready.  She stood up to cast Ring of Butcherblock, the spell that would take her home, when suddenly a griffon appeared out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;ACK!&quot; said Aganitte, as the griffon hit her for 95.  &quot;RUN!&quot; I said, and she did, tearing off through the rain toward the river.  Visibility was terrible, and she doesn't know her way around.  I caught sight of her and ran to catch up as a highland lion began swatting her also.<br>
<br>
She managed to find the path and started tearing along it at top SoW speed.  I kept trying to target her for a heal, but the lion was in the way.  A grizzly bear saw what was going on and joined the chase, swatting at the lion.  <br>
<br>
Fortunately, a group of griffon hunters happened to be standing alongside the path.  They grabbed the griffon as Aganitte tore through their ranks, but the lion was still hot on her heels.<br>
<br>
I'd managed to get off one or two blasts at the lion, but his health was pretty good.  Aganitte had only about an eighth of a bubble left as she reached the entrance of the bridge to South Karana.  Then, a swat from the lion knocked her to the ground.  Her health bar turned purple.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOO!&quot; I shouted out loud.  I was damned if I was going back to that stupid island and those stupid, shrieking, gurgling birdmen.  I stopped running long enough to cast Careless Lightning on the lion -- and he turned to attack me, just as Aganitte's health bar went down to one purple bubble.<br>
<br>
I kept blasting him, and finally killed him as Aganitte regained consciousness and ran off to heal herself.<br>
<br>
We both lived.  Lesson learned -- cast invis on yourself at the NK druid ring, even if you're just memming one spell.<br>

Much better in the long version.  It seems like the higher your level, the better your close-call stories.  Probably because you (and the baddies) have lots of HP, so pretty much everything takes a while to play out. <p><marquee width=300><B>Finrael of Felwithe</B>
