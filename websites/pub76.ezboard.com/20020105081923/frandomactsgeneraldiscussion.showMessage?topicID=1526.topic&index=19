<br>
Anyway, I'm female IRL, but I have yet to understand why anyone with eyes would think Liv Tyler isn't good looking.  Yipes!  Considering her father is Stephen Tyler of Aerosmith, you at least have to admit that she could look a lot worse <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And I didn't think Galadriel was supposed to be sexy--they could have cast Anna Nicole Smith, you know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Cate Blanchett was actually a fan favorite from the start for the role of Galadriel.  At any rate, she can act, which is a blessing, because the role of Galadriel could get soppy REAL fast.<br>
<br>
Now, about the book-- and if you haven't read it and you don't know what happens, stop, because there's some spoilage here!  <br>
<br>
*****************************************<br>
*****************************************<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate what Donnalinna says about the book.  LotR is more in the &quot;literature&quot; category, compared to other popular fantasy (like Robert Jordan).  It's an epic tale in the old style--like Beowulf.  And it's written in an old style.  I think he meant it to feel like something that happened long ago, but Donna's right that it stops short of involving you.  The Odyssey doesn't have that problem, and neither does Beowulf, but both those tales were passed down for centuries before being written.  LotR is lacking that aspect; it feels meant to be a story that couldn't possibly happen again, possibly because the world is too icky now.<br>
<br>
Of course, that's its appeal for folks dissatisfied with RL (How many times have I wished I could just go to Hobbiton!).  But it's almost like Tolkien is holding the world of the book up as an example of how things ought to be still.  He didn't like change; you can see that, and he was a bit of an elitist politically.<br>
<br>
The hobbits, for example, are simple folk.  They live in the country, they like to eat too much and play around instead of working hard, and overall they aren't the smartest race.  The second time I read the book, I squirmed a few times at how Tolkien condescended to the hobbits--some of the things he said about them sounded like what people say about country folks IRL.<br>
<br>
Kings, on the other hand, are instantly intelligent and brave, apparently just because they are kings.  Compare Aragorn (Strider) to Boromir:  Aragorn is kingly enough to step up when the time comes, even though he's been living as an outcast; Boromir and his family have been doing the actual duties of the crown for ages, yet somehow Boromir lacks the moral strength of Aragorn (even though he's been doing Aragorn's duty for him).  Boromir is constantly whining that his family doesn't get its due, and he's the first to succumb to the power of the ring--he's the weakest.  He does get a brave death, but that's the consolation prize.<br>
<br>
And the end! Ack, Samwise is the real hero, but he goes off to plant flowers and marry his childhood sweetheart, while his *master* Frodo goes off to the Hobbit Valhalla.  Apparently, masters deserve a more magnificent fate than servants, no matter how important the servants are. <br>
<br>
All that said, I still loved the books, because Tolkien did more right than he did wrong.  The main lesson:  Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The Ring Wraiths were scary on my first read, and on my second read I understood why--they are like the RL folks who are so enslaved to their vision of power that they just dump any concept of being human and serve their master, whatever that is (their work, a government, whatever).  Yikes!<br>
<br>
And Tolkien showed me what courage is--doing something you absolutely have to do, because you have to do it and for no other reason, even at your own mortal peril.  Wow.  And he showed that without getting up on a soapbox, and without bringing religion into it.  Now that's an achievement!<br>
<br>
In fact, it's an achievement that many modern fantasy writers just can't reach.  I'm reading A Game of Thrones by George RR Martin right now, and it rocks!  It's great, tons of plot, awesome writing, holds my interest every second--but there's something missing.  AGoT is great, but it hasn't awakened my intellectual interest or caused me to re-examine my own beliefs.  LotR did that, even when I was only 12 and I hardly had any beliefs!<br>
<br>
So that's why LotR probably feels dry on occasion--it's a book for the brain as well as the heart.  But that's also why it's worth reading.  So, choose your own poison!  And if you read this far, thank you for indulging me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
