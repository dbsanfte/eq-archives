<br>
As promised, here is a guide to clerics.  I'm sorry if it's not done yet, but I thought posting it might get some of the even more experienced clerics to voice some thoughts on it. <br>
<br>
Anyway, here goes.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Notes on Clerics:<br>
<br>
MOST IMPORTANT, play the race you want to play.  It doesn't<br>
matter who is &quot;the best&quot;.  It matters more who you'll have the<br>
most fun with.<br>
<br>
For example, stat wise Erudites make sub-par healers... but they look so cool in their platemail and banded armors!  So, play what you'll have fun with.<br>
<br>
Now, this might get kinda long, and this is all my opinion.  Not to mention that I might get sidetracked or be confusing.  So... take it with a grain of salt.  Your milage may vary.<br>
<br>
::<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :O --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":O"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> verview:::<br>
<br>
Clerics are the primary healing class in EQ.  They have a goodly amount of defensive spells (increase Armor Class, give extra protection to elements and magic, give temporary HP boosts), augmented by a great selection of healing abilities.<br>
<br>
In addition, Clerics make decent secondary fighter-types into the teen levels (where-as the other pure spell-castors fighting abilites poop out around 10 - 13) as they can wear up to Plate armor.  And, clerics are one of the most popular classes to have in a party.  It's a rare case when someone says &quot;No, we don't want a cleric.&quot;<br>
<br>
So... if you have what it takes to stick it out as a cleric, they'll come a time when you can log on, shout LFG, and get about 10 tells in 10 seconds ^_^<br>
<br>
No matter what anyone says, on an equal lvl basis, no one heals as well as a cleric.  Our healing spells are cheaper (we get an extra 10% healed or something like that.)  And, we get our stronger heals earlier on than any other semi-healer class.  Now, if you have a quasi-healer (druid, shaman, paladin, ranger) in your party, your work load is lessoned (they can cure disease, poison, heal the last bubble of health, that sort of thing.)<br>
<br>
However, a clerics combat abilities pewter out in the mid-teens (when tank classes start getting critical hits, dual attacks, dual weild, and the like).  The one attack a cleric gets doesn't compete at these higher lvls (which is one of the reasons clerics make poor soloists.)  And, other than the &quot;turn undead&quot; spells, a clerics attack spells are very weak, and very expensive mana-wise to cast.  So a clerics role tends to be a more defensive, motherly role.  You keep your boys patched up and healthy.  And, clerics tend to have to group up once they reach around 14th or 15th lvl.  On the plus side, Clerics do get the combat skill &quot;Dodge&quot; when they can still use it.<br>
<br>
Clerics can, unfortunately, also be horribly boring to play; especially at the higher levels.  Med, heal... med, heal... med, buff... med, heal.  If you want a more interactive character... a cleric might not be to your best choice.<br>
<br>
::<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :O --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":O"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> verall Tips:::<br>
<br>
Get used to using the F1 - F6 keys to target party members.  Keep an eye on their health, and ON YOURS!  I can't count the number of times I died because I didn't realize how low on HP I was, when I was healing someone else.  Also make sure the party keeps monsters off you.  If you say that you're being attacked, and no one replies, leave and find a better group.  There are always people happy to have a Cleric around.<br>
<br>
For low level poisons, simply let them run out on their own.  For the more difficult poisons, I would recommend detox after the fight (in case they get poisoned more than once, you still only have to heal them the one time.)<br>
<br>
Have a hot button that says &quot;Healing Target&quot;  That way they know you're paying attention, and if there are two clerics, hopefully you won't double up on one guy.  In fact, if there are two clerics, split the jobs up, so that both of you have a fairly ready pool of mana.<br>
<br>
Realize that casting a heal on your fighter-classess is a huge spike in the &quot;agression-o-meter&quot;.  It might pull several of the monsters onto you.  This is one of the biggest reasons to holy armor and HP buff yourself as well.<br>
<br>
Bless pets as well.  It'll help keep them alive too.  An Animation is another body to throw at the giant while you and your friends zone.  Spell Castors don't usually need the armor line, but the HP line is well used on them.<br>
<br>
If you do pull monsters onto you, don't run.  Fall back a couple of steps, and then let the fighter-types know you're under attack.  If you start running around, it'll be harder for your party members to pull the monster off of you.  Besides, clerics do get about 15 - 20 HP a lvl (depending on race and such), so you can take a whack or two without being too badly hurt.<br>
<br>
:::Race Overview:::<br>
<br>
Gnomes: stat wise, poorest clerics (low strength, low wisdom).  Okay starting zone, and easy access to good low level zones.<br>
<br>
Humans: middle-of-the-road clerics; above average combat abilities, average wisdom.  Humans make better Combat clerics due to their physical abilities.  Okay starting zones, and access to good low level zones.  Location wise, Freeport is a bit better location than Qeynos in terms of adventuring site, economics, and grouping.  However, both have good starting quests for new adventurers.<br>
<br>
Erudites: stat wise, 2nd poorest cleric.  High wisdom and so-so combat stats.  Erudites make good defensive clerics, and they do start a bit stronger than High Elves.  Worst starting zone.  Simply grab the letter from the bard, and head to Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Dark Elves: average wisdom abilities, and above average combat abilities make Dark Elves good Combat healers.  But their reputation isn't the best with the good races, so... you might have to spend a lot of time getting faction up, or selling to dubious merchants.  Neriak is an okay starting zone, but the KOS problems make Dark Elves have to spend serious time working on faction... if they care about that kinda thing.<br>
<br>
High Elves: Best initial wisdom... so-so combat stats.  Make one of the best Defensive Clerics.  Good starting zone monster-wise, but poorly patroled (i.e., not many guards in Faydark), and Faydark is sooooo easy to get lost in.  And... the newbee cleric quests in Felwithe are kinda lacking.<br>
<br>
Dwarves: Good combat stats, good wisdom make Dwarves a very good Combat Healer... not to mention just healers in general.  Butcherblock is a good place for exp, and easy to find your way around in... but can be frustrating to get money in.  Kaladim has some excellent quests for new adventurers (such as the bone quest.)<br>
<br>
Halflings: Good combat stats, good wisdom make Halflings a good cleric class as well.  not to mention the Halfling exp bonus will help you lvl up those first few lvls.  Misty Thicket is a very good zone to start in too.<br>
<br>
:::Creation overview:::<br>
<br>
Basically what I would recommend would be try to go for a strength of 70 - 75, and a wisdom of 120+ (if you can.)  Any extra points are your call.  For example, when I started my High Elf Cleric, I put 10 points into strength, and 20 into wisdom.  I would recommend putting extra points into strength first, as the banded, bronze, and steel armor gets heavy.  Those few extra points of strength help you carry your armor without getting bogged down.<br>
<br>
So, races that start with the higher Strength (Humans, Halflings, and Dwarves) can put that extra 5 points of stats into other attributes, such as Charisma, Dexterity, or Agility.<br>
<br>
:::Spell Overview:::<br>
<br>
Never underestimate the summon food/water.  Sure you might get tired of summoned black bread and water, but it's free.  So... summon 20 days worth food/water, and the spell has paid for itself.  And, some players ask for food water.  Summon them some, and boom, easy money.  Summon food/water should be done during down times.<br>
<br>
The hammer spells aren't bad.  You get your first magic weapon at lvl 8; not bad.  Overall, the summoned hammers aren't the best (low damage, slow, no special effect), but if you need a magic weapon, you can use it.  And, if you're on a corpse run, a hammer is nice to have, in case some of the monsters get rowdy.<br>
<br>
Don't underestimate your Stun spell line.  you can Stun an opponent as he runs, or interrupt a hostile castor.  If you do choose to have a stun memorized, I'd recommend two.  That way when the one stun is recharging, the other is ready to be used.<br>
<br>
The Center and Armor spell lines will be your bread and butter spells.  All the fighter types should have both of them cast on them.  You should have both too, but only if mana premits.  The spell-castors more just need the center for the extra HP.  Also, you can use the Center line of spells to heal as well, because not only do they increase the max HP of whoever you give it it, it also heals them by the amount you increase the max HP by.  So, if you increase the max HP by 45 points, you'll also heal them by 45 HPs as well.<br>
<br>
The Holy Aura spells are very good for helping you get the hell out of Dodge.  However, they only last a few seconds, so you best start hauling ass if you use them.  They are stop-gaps.  They buy you time to LEAVE!  Do not use it thinking that you'll be able to survive a mob.  All they do is grant you a few seconds to run to the zone.<br>
<br>
The Symbol spell line is excellent, as it usually add's 1 to 2 lvls worth of extra HP to a character.  But they can get expensive to cast (since you need Cats Eye Agate's)... be cautious on using it, if you feel you're not getting your fair share of the plunder.  If you do use it, just Symbol the primary puller, and make sure the other party members know to assist the primary puller.  This'll extend the life of your Cat Eye Agate supply, and save you some significant coin as well.<br>
<br>
Although &quot;Halo of Light&quot; is probably 4 lvls higher than it should be, for those who want a free piece of armor, and a light source equal to a GLS, get it.  &quot;Halo of Light&quot;, in my opinion, is a fairly swoovy spell.  Armor that lasts until you camp, weighs nothing, and gives a good light source for your other party members.  Can't beat that.  And, at night zones, and in dark dungeons, you'll be light up like a beacon for your other party members to fall back too.<br>
<br>
The Yaulp line is primary for Combat Healers.  It does have some nice bonues later on (i.e. in addition to getting a short-duration strength buff, you also get an AC buff, and sometimes an Attack Value buff.)  I don't use Yaulp much (as the weapon I use has that spells effect), but it is an effective spell for what it's meant to do; short-term combat bonus.<br>
<br>
When you have healing spells, have two types memorized.  A big heal, and a little heal.  For example, have Healing and Lesser Healing memorized at the same time.  That way, if you need to get off a quick heal, you have a less powerful (therefore less time to cast) to heal.  And, you'll be able to save mana when you heal as well (as you can use the Lesser Heal on your spell-castor types that won't normally need the more powerful heal.)  And, when you do get to low/critical mana, you can still cast one or two last heals before you need to med again (giving your fighters that little bit of a bonus.)<br>
<br>
:::Combat Healers:::<br>
<br>
A Combat healer is a cleric who, instead of thinking and healing, gets into the scrap himself.  If you want to be a combat healer, you should start with the races that have higher base combat stats.  <br>
<br>
Best races stat wise: Dwarves, Humans, Halflings, Dark Elves.  I'd say these races as they start out with average to above-average combat stats, alowing you to melee better.<br>
<br>
::<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> efensive Healers:::<br>
<br>
A Defensive healer is more likely to sit and meditate during a fight, and only fight when absolutely necessary.  If you want to be a Defensive Healer, keep more of the Cleric defensive spells (like a couple of heals, some blessings, and a couple of stun/root spells.)<br>
<br>
Best races stat wise: High Elves, Dark Elves, Erudites.<br>
<br>
Honestly, even players who want a Combat Healer will have to, at some point, become a Defensive Healer.  Clerics simply don't have the martial prowess to keep up after the teens.<br>
<br>
:::Grouping as a Cleric:::<br>
<br>
As a cleric, you're role is more defensive.  You're a secondary fighter (i.e., while the big, burly guys go at it, you stand back with the mages.  Should a monster start attacking the mage, you can aid the mage till the fighter-types arrive.)  You heal, you bless, you keep your freinds fed.<br>
<br>
Now, when you group, try to keep the other party members remembering their roles.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For low level poisons, simply let them run out on their own. For the more difficult poisons, I would recommend detox after the fight.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Also important to learn as you go what is a poison/disease and what isn't. For example, there are several necromancer and shaman series of spell that use icons for poisons/diseases (and some even say poison or disease) that are NOT poisons or diseases, but are instead magical &quot;effects&quot; (i.e. a cure will often times not remove them, whereas a cancel magic would). Unfortunately there appears to be no real rhyme or reason as to which spells are truely poisons/diseases and which are strictly magical effects and only trial and error will suffice.<br>
<br>
Another thing of note is that as you get higher in level, the types and severities of poison and disease you will be dealing with also grows (sometimes faster than your ability to &quot;fix&quot; them). This is especially obvious in the Planes, where most Clerics go at 46th and still have a very outdated cure disease spell. There are a few mobs in particular that drop a disease that require Four to Five castings of &quot;cure disease&quot; to remove it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Never underestimate summon food/water. Sure you might get tired of summoned black bread and water, but it's free. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Only one footnote here. &quot;Naked&quot; corpses decay in 5 minutes regardless of your level. Adding one item, even a summoned one, extends that to the &quot;normal&quot; timers (24 hours played, 7 days offline). If you're in a situation where you may expect &quot;chain deaths&quot; (such as a Nagafen raid), always ALWAYS summon yourself an item before you go back to the fight so that ALL of your corpses can be ressurected. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Don't underestimate your Stun spell line. you can Stun an opponent as he runs, or interrupt a hostile caster.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Only thing to remember is our stuns are purely magic based and give a bonus to save. That means if you're fighting anything high level (compared to you) or especially resistant to magic (like Kobolds in Solusek B) stun will get resisted a lot. The only reason I bring this up is a normal stun is almost no taunt, even damaging ones. A <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> resisted</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> stun is a huge taunt, and I've often accidentally pulled mobs out of fights with a resisted stun.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Holy Aura spells are very good for helping you get the hell out of Dodge. However, they only last a few seconds, so you best start hauling ass if you use them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This entirely depends on the situation, but for the most part is absolutely correct. Some things to remember about the &quot;divine&quot; spells...<br>
1) They all last 18 seconds.<br>
2) You cannot be harmed, summoned, cast upon (or cast yourself), or stunned while you are &quot;divined&quot;.<br>
3) The Divine spells are big detaunts. That means if you're taking a beating but you're not going to die immediately, it might be best to hold off on the divine spell until you need it. Reason being is as soon as you cast it, half (or more) of the things beating on you are going to run back into the party.<br>
4) Divine Aura (the low level one) lasts 18 seconds, gives you invulnerability, casts fast and takes almost no mana. Divine Barrier (the higher level one) lasts 18 seconds, give you invulnerability, heals approximately 20% of your health (1 bubble), casts slower and takes noticable mana to cast. It's important to remember which is which, and which is called for in a given situation. Trying to cast Divine Barrier while being shredded is likely to result in interruptions and a dead cleric. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Symbol spell line is excellent, as it usually add's 1 to 2 lvls worth of extra HP to a character.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
These also increase noticably in power as you progress in levels, and unfortunately the material componant cost also increases in price exponentially. The 44th level symbol spell, Naltron, requires a Peridot to cast (~9-13 plat depending on faction and charisma) but gives just shy of 500 HP.<br>
On raids, Symbols are a must. However, most organized raids have an &quot;entrance fee&quot; of near 100 plat. Know what it's for? You got it, reimbursing the clerics for their Peridots! It's also used to reimburse enchanters for their peridots (used in Rune IV I think), shamans for their potions, etc etc. The point being, the higher level you get the more beloved your symbol spell will become and the more willing people will be to pay you for it.<br>
<br>
Anywho, enough rambling for now. Well written Donnalinna! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><hr align="center" width="80%" size="2">

<br>
Summoned items do not extend corpse timers any more. This is important to remember! If at all possible, on the way back to your corpse kill a spiderling or something similarly low level just so you can loot an item. Any item will do, as long as it is not summoned.<br>
