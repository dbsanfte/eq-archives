I'm not mad at the guild or anything, honestly.  I am really hoping the person involved will read this and realize how it was from the other side and how it looked to us...I realize from her side of things we were just a buncha zone hugging fools who were in the way...and just do the right thing and step up to apologize to Jacrail, who took a bunch of time and effort to get us all there at the same time... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

One train, sure. Two, mistakes happen. 3 trains, its time to get out of that dungeon, cuz you don't know what the hell you're doing. I don't know who this group was that was in CoM, quite frankly, I don't care. I'm not an officer, so I can't take any actions. <br>
<br>
But my pride in RA is hurt when I see this kind of thing happening in -my- guild. This is totally unnacceptable, to cause over 3 deaths due to uncontrolled pulls.<br>
<br>
We're not only meant to be altruistic FA camp givers, we're also meant to be responsible and smart players. C'mon folks.<br>

I've seldomly read such a deferentially written post. While you truely seem to have been hurt, you show us the way of nobility, which isn't a surprise for I know the house T'Vlos for being a wonderful gathering of people.<br>

I would be glad to help out the House, not to help forget about the incident but to strengthen your mind (still) considering us as good people.<br>
don't take me on this as an officer cause I'm not. Still I would be glad to give you a hand since I know how un-safe the outside zone-line is and how safe the inside zone-line is (supposed to be). <p><img src="http://www.morosa.f9.co.uk/kaymar.gif">

The Member of Random Acts involved in the trains was Me. Yes Redsoulz. I was in a Group with a lvl 56 Monk hunting fog golems peacefully. The monk asked if one of her close friends could join the group so he may collect the scrolls needed for his Shaman epic. After hunting for a bit the monk lead the young shaman near  the castle to recieve a clairty from another friend. Upon returning a train was pulled. The young shaman was in trouble so off I ran to heal him to aid his journey to the zone. Unforturenately no matter how fast I casted on this young soul he did not make it. Upon healing and his death I recived the great token of the Aggro. I do not care how uber you may be, but you cannot handle 8 COM mobs alone, I was forced to run. The consecutive trains were pulled during the young shaman's corpse retrievals. With a maximum of three trains. After exiting the zone I was met with with lude comments of a train puller, which I expected since it was my group, and as I too would be somewhat upset. I expressed my sincere appologies, but was met constantly with more and more lude comments. After over five minutes of these comments, I began to take it personally, I could not have appologized more for not only myself , but the other two members of my group. That's when I got upset and stoped appologizing and said nothing. The player characters were all less than 3 feet from the zone line. When you stand at THE ONLY zone line problems are to be expected.  I again appologize to all who perished and would gladly offer my services to help regain the experience lost by this tragedy to you are anyone of your choice. I am a kind person both ingame and out, I will and do go out of my way to help anyone that may need it , wether or not they ask. That is why I joined this guild. I tell you when members read this post and find out that it was me you were talking of , they will be shocked to no end.  <p>Redsoulz Drakoniz <br>

Darnit Red, I left your name out of this ON PURPOSE.<br>
<br>
Please please don't disband from Random Acts....just the fact that you'd like to proves to me you belong there...I said I VERY much understand that it was just a bad nite, heck we ALL have them...I just wanted you to talk to Jacrail because he was so bummed and felt everything was his fault that nite....<br>
<br>
You've already publicly apologized, which is more than I asked for, and although the apology is appreciated, you leaving the guild was NOT what was desired.<br>
<br>
Please reconsider.  If I thought you were 'evil pain in the arse guildmember #101' I'd have used your name hon, and I would have emailed it to your officers when they requested I do so.  I know in the past I've stepped on people and hurt their feelings without realizing it because of the things *I* was dealing with at the moment.  Nobody's perfect.  I just SO wanted Jacrail to feel a bit better and I knew if you just talked to him quick he would...*sigh*<br>
<br>
Oh darn Red please please don't leave your guild.  It's so obvious to me you belong there.<br>
<br>
*hugs*<br>
<br>
Please, for me?  Please don't leave?<br>

<br>
You unfairly drew the fire from me because of your guildtag.  You weren't the only one there, nor the only one involved in the trains.  But because of your guildtag I expected more of you and to be honest, upon reflection I shouldn't have.  I am sorry I even brought this here now if it causes you to leave your guild.  I beg you to reconsider.<br>
<br>
Friend Redsoulz, we all cause trains.  I am further HURT to find you were on a CR for a groupmember when all this happened...because we could have helped with CR, would have been happy to, we had a lvl 54 necro that I would have sent in in a moment's notice, and we had a cleric who would have happily rezz'd.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Please don't leave your guild.  This is your home and you from your actions so obviously belong here.  Our communication that night should have been better.  On both sides I imagine, and therefore I take the blame for my part in the miscommunication, and as a 2nd for my guild I also take responsibility for any of the angry comments that were made.  What do you think hon, should we both leave our guilds over this?  I know I don't want to leave my guild because I failed to communicate properly with you.  You still sure you want to leave because you did the same with me and mine?  Considering some of my guildmembers were not, shall we say, acting in the most polite manner that they could have been?<br>
<br>
We all have bad nights.  I wish I had just chalked this all up to a bad nite on your part and kept my mouth shut.  I cannot take back what I have done, for that I apologize.  <br>
<br>
You are obviously a noble person.  I would be honored to hunt with you at any time.  Even in CoM.  *chuckles* <br>
<br>
Come on, please don't leave..please?<br>

<br>
My dear sweet Red, and dear Jyssa too, we all know how bad things can happen in this world of ours with plenty of malice aforethought, although I've rarely run across those who actually plan on going out of their way to ruin another's day. We've all reacted somewhat harshly when we feel another is making a bad pull and getting those in our party killed, and after all the harsh words are exchanged feel remorseful that we reacted that way. One's view is still strictly onesided until the other side is heard too.<br>
<br>
Things like this have happened to every single one of us, the best thing is truly to hug and makeup.<br>
<br>
And our family will indeed be saddened with missing our lovely leezard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color="#cc6633"><font size=4>Meriel

<br>
Its now I who should offer you an apology for my vitriolic reaction. You've explained the situation, and its clear that it was just good intentions gone wrong. <br>
<br>
I've hunted with you many times,  and you're a very valuable member in my opinion. <br>
<br>
What happened wasn't as clear cut as it seemed in the original post; you were trying to help, not camping or fighting irresponsibly. <br>
<br>
Again, I'm very sorry for my tone, and my anger, since it was very misplaced. You already went through enough abuse for this incident already; you didn't need me piling more on top of it.<br>
