<br>
But big mouths talk themselves into trouble some days, when your mind is on a song, and your hand is on a drink, and the next thing you know that silly old oaf turns about to be a real wizzard, and he has some most excellent friends, and your knowledge is invaluable to their safe mission.... no-where to run to, no chance of sliping away into the shadows. No this time you have to go through with it (hey maybe I could run 'the wrong way' and exit to safety....)<br>
<br>
Also my barve comrades swiftly overcame the feeble dungeons guards, and rushing over a very unsafe looking bridge (perhaps a chance to trip and fall !) before quickly darting down into a low cavern. My heart pumping as I now realised that I had no way back, and so had to follow these heroes, as the party's survival was my own survival.<br>
<br>
Not content to stop at this dank and vile corner, they pushed forever deeper, untill the small corridor open into a large cave, with an onimious looking door at the far end. Quickly dispatching the pervious occupiers of the cavern we moved over to the door. It was locked (hurrah - if we rush back to the entrance we can have a goog drink and a few songs :!) Alas a shiftie looking havling approached the door, and in just a second the mighty door slowly moved upwards..<br>
<br>
Cautiously movign inside, the door silently fell behind us, and the room was bathed in an eerie light. It was at this point we noticed bodies on the floor, a failed party had only made it this far and then they had all fallen.. what lurking danger must be ahead of us.<br>
<br>
'Now this part of the dungeon is very dangerous - the guardians of the Crypt have harm touch, so if all three guardians come at once it will be most difficult'<br>
<br>
Ouch.. harm touch.... humm I wonder...<br>
<br>
Even the parties mighty ogre warrior looked afraid.. the cleric was casting over and over, bathing the warrior in magical protection....<br>
<br>
I was reading through my songbook, I was sure that there must be something useful in there, all those songs, there must be something useful... how I wished I had paid attention in the guildhall's rather than sneaking out to fishing.....<br>
<br>
'OK, lets be ready for the guardians..''<br>
<br>
And then it hit me ..'Stop Stop... I have a song, a special song, let me remeber it fullly'<br>
<br>
of course, one of those useless songs that no-oen ever so much as hummed, it had a strange magical effect, it bathed the entire party in a very feeble damage shield and so was considered by most learned bards to be useless, but the damage shiled had a special property... yes it would fail is the damage the struck it was greater than it was, but it would absord all that damage... ah ha...so the might harm touch would be rendered useless with it.. now what was it called....<br>
<br>
The fight was swift. The guardians had no chance against our party. <br>
<br>
'How took all the harm touches?' creid out the ogre...<br>
There was no reply...<br>
<br>
And then the leader walked up beside me and said 'The bard did, with her songs... thats why we brought her with us'<br>
<br>
Of course the rest of the night was spent raiding the crypt, once inside there defenses were weak, and I have written a wonderful new song that boasts of my solo destruction of the great guardians of the crypt, which yo uwill no doubt get to hear in full in a tavern soon, when we left our backpacks where filled with loot, but it didn't matter.. for once I really had crawled a dungeon, and for once I was not just an observer.<br>
