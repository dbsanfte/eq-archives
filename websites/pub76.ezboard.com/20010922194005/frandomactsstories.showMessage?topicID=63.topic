That was an understatement.  This particular woodelf had apparently fallen out of Kelethin and hit every ugly branch on the way down, promptly hitting the ugly ground, breaking every ugly bone in her ugly body and then sadly, being bitten by and ugly black wolf.<br>
<br>
That is not to say she had never been with a man before.  Dranken Trueshot had found himself completely hammered at the local Kelethin pub one Saturday night.  In walks Puree, on the prowl and willing to do whatever just to get a man.  Having his drinking glasses on, Dranken decided that Puree was not that bad looking after all.   Besides, since he could not actually focus on the woman….no harm done.  Just to make sure everything went her way, Puree slipped him a ruffie.  One can never be too sure, can they?  The rest is history.  Uriel Trueshot was born, one of the finest Rangers in the land.  He became renowned for his massive trains in Norrath.  He was also known to play practical jokes on his friends.  Just get Neao to tell you about the “Corpse in a Fire” story.  That one is a legend in itself.<br>
<br>
But, unfortunately, the story does not end there.  One night, Dranken had drunken too many.   Mistaking an Orc Centurion for  his homely Puree,  he was promptly killed and eaten.<br>
<br>
The years passed.  The ruffies trick would no longer work for Puree. And ohhhh, she needed a man badly!  She began to travel.  First she tried Crushbone, but the Orcs were appalled by here looks.  Next she tried Kaladim, but the dwarves weren’t that desperate.  She tried Lesser Faydark.  The brownies scurried in fear.<br>
<br>
What was she to do?  Deciding that taking her own life was the only solution, she left for Steamfont to sacrifice herself to the Minotaurs.  <br>
<br>
Upon entering the dreaded cave, a voice whispered out to her, “To sacrifice thyself would prove a waste of such grand beauty.”<br>
<br>
Where were these words coming from?   Who could say such lovely things?<br>
<br>
“I am here” said the low voice, “come to me, my princess.”  She walked closer to the shadows.  It was there that she discovered a handsome Half-Elf shimmering with light.  He took her in his arms and they made the sweet love.<br>
<br>
Little did she know that the Half-Elf was really an evil gnome enchanter by the name of Erekiel.  His love for women of all kinds was legendary.  His methods for getting these women were sinister and evil.<br>
<br>
Thus was born, Azariel, bastard child to Puree, bastard half-brother to Uriel Trueshot.  <br>
<br>
*editors note*  No innocent orc centurions, black wolves, dwarves or brownies were enjured in the writing of this story.<br>
<br>
   Azariel:  Has become a Necromancer, learned in the ways  of the dark arts.  He also owns a nursery where he grows the most beautiful and sought after Tulips.<br>
<br>
   Uriel Trueshot:  Still known for his massive trains and practical jokes.  He has become an avid fisherman, choosing to fish with friends while drunk.  Also, arrested for indecent exposure while relieving himself near a barbarian fishing village.<br>
<br>
   Erekiel the Evil Gnome:  Was put in an Half-Elf prison for impersonating a high elf government official.<br>
<br>
   Puree Truesot:  Still on the prowl for a good man and has bought stock in a ruffies manufacturing plant. There are even reports of another bastard child by the name of Uzekiel, but these stories are unfounded.<br>
