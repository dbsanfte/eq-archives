There's been a lot of talk about what each member could do, or has done, or hasn't done.<br><br>I want to try a little different approach.  I want to step back and let everyone know why I am an RA, and relate how I found the guild, and what it meant to me to join this guild.  I hope others can step forward and do the same.<br><br>Add to this thread and maybe we can all understand each other a little better.  This post may be a little long, but hopefully all of you will know me a little better becuase of it, and why I'm here in the first place.<br><br>I am a relative newbie, compared to a lot of people in this guild.  I started playing over Labor Day weekend in 2001, after hearing about EQ from multiple friends for a long time.  I started a character on Morell-Thule because one of my friends played there.  I started playing around with a high elf mage.  He was around level 5 when he made the big trip to Kelethin from Felewithe.  I was grouped with my wife's character at the time.<br><br>Up on one of the flets in Kelethin, I was suddenly presented with a trade screen.  I had never seen one before.  Not sure what to do, I hit the enter key and said &quot;What are you doing&quot;.  The other person said &quot;Just click the trade button&quot;.<br><br>Well, I got a real nice helmet that increased INT, mage only.  I couldn't believe it.  Wow!<br><br>The person that gave it to me was named Hamadryad Long.  The only reason I can remember that is because I'm a big Robert Heinlein fan (sorry if that doesn't explain anything).<br><br>I said to my wife &quot;I hope I can do this someday&quot;.  Hamadryad, like she read my mind, said &quot;Pass this on someday when you're ready&quot;, or something like that.<br><br>Well, I gave up the mage a week or so later, and started a cleric one Saturday morning.  I had more fun healing other newbies than I ever had before.  Now THIS is fun!<br><br>The cleric progressed until I had Ward Undead.  Skeletons got too easy.  I'm going to Unrest!  In Unrest, I met a lot of others, one of whom I sponsored in the guild after I became a member.  Anyway, one day some friends sent me a tell that they were fighting gobs in BBM, and wanted me to get there ASAP.  I sent them an &quot;OMW&quot;, and started to leave Unrest.  On the way out, there was this wolf, so I stopped and said, &quot;I am in need of haste, can you help me?&quot;<br><br>Well, not only was I sow'ed, but got so many other buffs my buff bar almost exploded.  I /bowed, and then saw a bunch of other people with my wolf friend that all had &lt;Random Acts&gt; floating over their heads.  I don't remember the names of the players, but I remember the wolf was Hamadryad Long.  I thanked her profusely, and she said &quot;Our pleasure&quot; - I will always remember that.<br><br>Now, roll the clock forward a month or so.  I'm a big man at level 16 or so, and I'm in Butcherblock.  By this time, I had given out some weapons and armor to newbies in front of kaladim, just for the fun of watching their surprise.  I heard someone auctioning a Scarab Breastplate.  I sent him a tell that I had just given one of those away, and he would get a lot more out of watching the reaction from giving it to a newbie then whatever he could get in plat.  He replied that I sounded like one of those &quot;Random Acts&quot; people.  He made it sound almost like that was a bad thing.  Now, I had to find out what he meant.<br><br>So, I looked around and tracked down what Random Acts was.  I never made the connection to &quot;Random Acts of Kindness&quot; until I found the guild site.  I can't explain how good I felt when I found that not only were there others who enjoyed giving in Norrath, but that there was a guild dedicated to what gave me the most satisfaction in playing EQ!<br><br>Not only that, but the guild did not expect anything except my trying to spread a wonderful infection throughout Norrath.  I didn't have to prove anything.  I just could associate with the people that enjoyed the same thing I did.<br><br>Problem was, I didn't know anyone in RA.  But the web site said that was OK, so I just applied.  Wipl and Emerest both volunteered as sponsors.  I started my newbie quest and looked forward to the next FA camp.<br><br>Unfortunately, the camp was at LOIO, and I was a little nervous about going there.  Hamadryad had posted that she would be in Freeport for fledglings that were too low a level to get to LOIO.  So, on Saturday, about three hours before the camp, I came online, and saw Hamadryad was on.  I sent here a /tell saying I had never been to Kunark, I was a fledgling at level 18, and should I just go to Freeport?  She said she would come get me.  Yikes, I wasn't sure what to do, but I met her at the docks in Butcherblock.<br><br>I had the true honor of riding the shuttles and boat to FV with her, and got to talk to the lady that founded this great guild.  I found out she was indeed named after a Heinlein character, and we talked most of the way about his novels.  I then had her escort me to the windmill in LOIO, to be sure I got there safely.<br><br>At the FA camp, I finally saw all the names I had seen on the BBS, and ran around healing and buffing my head off.  The first person I helped was way low on health, and I healed and buffed the snot out of him, at least as much as I could.  He thanked me profusely.  All I could say, even though I was not tagged yet, is &quot;Our pleasure&quot;, the same as Hama once told me.  I still say that whenever someone thanks me at an FA camp.<br><br>I got tagged, my brand new guildchat exploded with welcomes, and I was so happy I honestly almost cried.<br><br>Nothing, nothing in Norrath is as good as this guild.  I got what I wanted.  Not prestige.  Not twinks.  Just a bunch of the very best people I have met in Norrath, all sharing the same joy in giving, in whatever way they can, without any need for thanks or recognition except to know they are doing what they think is the right thing.<br><br>That is why I joined Random Acts.<br><br>Gimley Stoutheart, cleric of Kaladim<br>Lodrood, druid of Rivervale <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ubalamurstoutfaith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balamur Stoutfaith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Retired Officer<br><font color=red>The invisible dorf!</span><br>  Posts: 788<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 11:46:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1597.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why I joined Random Acts</span><hr size=1> *smiles* And that's how it should be.<br><br>My first enounter with Random Acts was as a lowly Barbarian Warrior... about my 5th character ever, of which only 2 had made it past 10th level (Kemas, my deceased Paladin, and Balamur). So there I stood, 6th level, shivering the cold outside Halas knowing I wanted to be in East Commons hunting orcs. I knew nothing about Permafrost or Everfrost or Black Burrow and I didn't want to at the time. I hated new places, they were so confusing and frightening.<br><br>So there I stood with perhaps 4 or 5 pieces of tattered armor, a sowing kit I bought myself, a bronze long sword a passing high level had practically thrown at me, and a desire to be amongst familiar surroundings.<br><br>/shout Can someone show me the way to East Commons?<br><br>I met my first Random Acts person that day... a bard. Shame on me, it's been so long I cannot remember their name. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  They not only volunteered, but ran me the whole way. Newbie fears and all (I'd never been to the Karanas, talk about big scarey places at 5th level!). We ran through North Karanas with about 20 lions chasing us, I was chanting in group say don'tstopdon'tstopdon'tstop hehe.<br><br>Flash foward many months and levels later. My 4th or 5th guild has just gotten into a huge fight about... you guessed it, loot and levels. I was so tired, tired of the games, tired of the fighting, the pettiness, the downright hate and disregard for eachother. I had had enough... I detagged myself and almost &quot;pull the trigger&quot; on the account. During those last few months I had started lurking around these very forums, posting from time to time here just to keep in touch with these great and wonderful people. At the depths of my despair, I was dragged out of it when I was readily accepted here. I finally found what I'd been looking for... friends and family. Electronic strangers, sure... but closer to me than most of my flesh and blood family had ever been in all my years.<br><br>I made friends, helped where I could, ran a lot of my own little solo FA camps (since I had such horrible luck attending the official ones), and generally tried to be helpful enough to offset my dorfish attitude. Being, at the time, amongst a very small slice of RA members in their higher levels I became very proud of the determination of those around me. I had a lot of fun learning with them, and even teaching a few (to date myself... hey Meriel, remember learning to kite? That was so fun!) a trick or two.<br><br>Random Acts is my online family, regardless of whether or not I'm playing this silly game or another one, or none at all as has been the case lately. I've said this before but nobody ever asks so it must not have been said enough yet.

However when my father joined I started watching Random Acts. <br>        This wasn't the first game I had seen groups of people who like to add a tag to their name and say they belong. I play many many other games, but I had never joined a &quot;guild&quot; or a &quot;clan&quot; or a &quot;tribe&quot;. The reason being was because I felt stronger and more assured of my victory when I played by myself. These groups seemed to band together for a time, then quarrls would break out, fighting, and eventually what walls they had built would crumble around them.<br>       I would ask constantly about the guild and though I was level 9 at the time I was very excited at the chance to join. Ortaak..my frist RA friend taught me in the way I should go and has aided me many times sense my initiation. <br>       My favorite past times are just droping by The Greater Faydark. Thats where the action is, many get struggled very easily there and a bind is always in demand. ^_^ I love TPing in and mowing down a bunch of orcs and then giving away armor and the like. Its a great way to promote the guild and more importantly, to show others that this is isn't a Me VS You game, this is a Us VS NPC game. I'll lend you my magic, you lend me your sword and all shall fall before us. It's only when we work together that nothing seems impossible.<br>       Random Acts is different than any other group I've encountered. We don't have power hungry leaders, we have friends that look out for our best intrest as well as the countless others of Noraath. <br>       This guild taught me that everyone is help. Level 9s to level 40s, we are all help and all have a speical gift to give to others. We're all important.  <br>       I wanted to join a guild where I could make friends, and now I have so many its nearly impossible to keep track of them all.

In all those years, I never even grouped with anyone else, much less joined a guild.  So, I finally broke down and bought EQ after AC wanted to charge me $60 to keep my test account.  I made a human warrior because I thought they would be the easiest to play and give me a chance to learn the game commands.  I ventured out to West Karanas at the tender level of 8 and hit the bandit farm.   Out there, I met this weird trio of pathetic losers - Tchallar, Uriel, and Talidas.  :-)<br><br>We stayed out there for a couple of weeks, leveling and getting filthy rich!  I saw my first PP from that camp.  All the while, I kept hearing about this really cool lady named Hamadryad who wanted to start a guild.  Talidas tried his best to talk me into helping them get it set up, but I refused.  Yes, that is right, I turned down the opportunity to be a founding member of RA!!  Feel free to gasp and throw fruit.  I resisted the attempts of my friends for another week or so to join and then one day, Hama herself came out.  <br><br>Hama asked me why I wasn't interested in joining the guild since I so obviously enjoyed the company of its members and they enjoyed mine.  I told her that I was rude, crude, and socially unacceptable.  I also did not like people.  Hama told me that I was perfect for the guild just for those qualities.  That she wanted unique people to fill the ranks of RA, all dedicated to spreading a bit of kindness throughout Norrath.

They thought that was fun too!  <br><br>And they didn't try to urge me onward all the time.  Slow is how I play, and it can tick people off sometimes because they want me to catch up.  But being a slow leveler in RA is great -- I've grouped with just about everybody at one time or another <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br><br>And nobody ever looks sideways at me for wanting to do something that doesn't involve xp--like hanging out with a bunch of lowbies for hours and hours, or dragging people all over Norrath with teleports <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I can always find someone to hang out with me, too.  And nobody makes fun of me for it--well, most of the time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Everquest, like real life, is often boring and sometimes exasperating.  The thing that makes it bearable is having people who will listen to you, help you out with questions, and sometimes just loaf around doing nothing with you.<br><br>That's you guys.  Thanks for being in our guild, everybody.<br><br> <p><font color=green><font size=3>Gwion Llewellyn</font><br><font color=white><font size=2>Level, um, 43<br>"The flapping...the endless flapping..."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ukaral2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karal2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b><font color=yellow>Officer<br>Retired Council Member </font><br><b><font color=blue>Administrator<br>Website Coordinator<br><font color=red>Ethical Medal of Action</font></span><br>  Posts: 758<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/02 11:04:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1597.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why I joined Random Acts</span><hr size=1> Well, I got into EQ because a guy at work told me about it, and I had been into D &amp;D from way back when it first came out (just the first 3 manuals at that time), and this guy told me that EQ was just like D &amp; D. But of course he was fairly high level so I knew I would never get to join him.<br><br>  He suggested that I start out with a warrior so as not to have to learn too much to start with. And he suggested the MT server as it had just come up in the last month. So Karal was born in Freeport.<br><br>   Now then, I am a fairly slow typer, so I didnt really talk to folks too much, and was really just learning the game. I had not really made any EQ freinds and alot of the folks that I did interact with just werent that freindly or helpful with such a newbie. I was actually on the verge of quitting as my free month was close to expiring. Then one day, as I hunted alone in EC (I had never even been further then EC, except for one deadly visit to WC), when I saw an /ooc. &quot;New guild being formed, based on kindness and helping others&quot; Well, turns out Hama was seeking some others to form RA, and this idea appealed to me, since it would be nice to actually find some nice folks to play with. After a few tries, I was able to send her a tell, and she came to talk to me for a minute.<br><br>   Next thing I knew we were camping out to a chat room (she told me about the rooms). There I meet a few other folks, and we talked while waiting to get ten folks together at one time in the room to approve the formation of the guild. We finally managed to get our ten folks and boom RA was formed. Well approved at least. In those days itt could take a week or so to get a GM to actually tag a guildleader. And a few days after Hama got her tag, we managed to get together and I got my tag. For me the rest is history.<br><br>    I am so happy that I replied to that /ooc, as I really would have quit, and never have had the chance to spend time with all the many wonderful folks that have worn the tag over the what 18 or so months that RA has been around. It has trully been an honor and priveledge to be associated with all you folks. <p><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2rj22/images/gsign1.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uravenmystpeaceheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenmyst Peaceheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/1/02 12:52:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1597.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why I joined Random Acts</span><hr size=1> Jellybean here. Gimley, thanks for starting this thread, I believe all of us should respond to this post and one that should be bumped when you feel its fading out.<br><br>    Ah the memories of old!  I first started my EQ playing days on Rallos Zek back in April of ‘99.  It was a rough environment.  Within the first 20 minutes of my EQ life I was pked and my starting sword was then looted away.  It was that very second, I knew I wanted to fight for the good and make the gaming world of this game I’ve been waiting for years to come true (many different races and classes in graphics and not through a text-mud).  A couple of other folks felt the same and thus &quot;Hand of Norrath&quot; was formed.  We started from scratch, the highest member was a level 13 warrior. We knew it would be tough for a bunch of shamans and warriors to fight off the pure casters such as wizzies, but didn’t matter, because we had the love, trust, and care for each other to help us through.  As months grew, we grew as the guild known on the server as the strong anti-pkers guild on the server.  Risking our lives to safe those who were in need of help from these pkers.  We were also known as the guild who would buff up all the newbies so they can live and simply make their EQ lives fun and enjoyable.  None of us cared about being being the highest level people out there (then again, seeing someone in full bronze in your 20’s was a haw-dropping experience). We pretty much were the Random Acts of Rallos Zek and well to be honest, that says a lot for a guild on RZ. <br>  <br>     I then decided to quit EQ to settle RL things.   After three months, my life was back on track and went back to EQ, but this time I was in the process of looking for a blue server, simply because I didn’t want to deal with the stress of being ganked on RZ.  Back then I was a frequent reader on the stratics board and decided to check out the &quot;guilds&quot; section. Lone and behold, I saw a post by Lady Hamadryad.  The post was pretty much how she was starting a new guild on one of the servers that just came live.  Of course, the part of the post about practicing kindness immediately interested me because it sounded like my old guild.  I directly went to the site and simply fell in love with it. The touching words of Lady Hamadryad and her belief of helping others through kindness and my only other experience from Hand of Norrath did me in.I went to the board and posted that I wanted to join. Ya guys remember the forum layout back then, just a tad different now isn’t it? Hehe.  Well, like Gorte, I remember that night very well.  In that chat room, I remember Lady Hamadryad had to get her son to help out  and recruit people in the general chat to get enough people to start up the guild.  It was nerve racking that night trying to get at least 10 people to stay and remain in the chat room to send in the approval.  It was like de je vu all over again. A guild starting from scratch with basically the same ideals.  A dream come true for me.  Not only will it be like my old guild but on a blue server as well, where I can relax and have fun.<br><br>   Well, after a week or so if I remember correctly, the guild was approved and I received a tell from Lady Hamadryad to hear the great news. My very first time I saw a Random Act tag was when I did a /who all on Lady Hamadryad after that tell. You would be lucky to even see more then 4 RA’s on doing a /who all. Also, none would be over level 20 except Ealwen, a high elf cleric who just seemed to sky rocket through levels, our first &quot;uber&quot; character.  Okay, kunark wasn’t out and if you were lvl 40 + you were uber to me..lol.  If you did /w who all, it was like everyone was so far apart.  Luckily for me, I already brought Jelly from Gnome town to his hang out place. That day, a gnome enchanter still wearing his banana yellow suit robe got tagged into the guild. I still remember the time of day it was in Norrath, it was during a sunset right in the spot where the loathsome individuals hung around in front of the Blackburrow entrance.  Don’t remember the exact number I was to get into the guild like Gorte and Grim does, I’m pretty sure I was one of the first ten. But that day, I knew something special happened and it still lives on to this day: Random Acts of Kindness.  A guild that was born and made up of people coming from past servers and new to everquest in general with one common goal.  The goal of making everquest a place where we can share kindness to everyone, not just for their lives in everquest, but life in general.  That itself is a gift that will live on in everyones mind and heart forever, even when there is no longer a Random Acts.  Thank you and take care all.<br><br>Jellybean Goodheart<br>Proud member of Random Acts<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uaganitte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aganitte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/1/02 1:56:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1597.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/15/1791915.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why I joined Random Acts</span><hr size=1> Great thread!<br><br>As Gwion mentioned earlier, I'd been playing on Bertoxx server before I joined Morrel Thule.<br><br>To be honest, I played the game wrong from the very start. Unlike many of you, I was not wise about loot, levels and cash. Not that I was greedy at the expense of others, per se, but I was definately among those very much concerned with being 'uber'. I was also very very bad at being uber. But in EQ, anyone can be Uber, with enough determination. When I finally left my old server to come over to MT to play with Gwion, I left a 45th level SK in full Dark Forge behind...and a very heavy heart. I'd burned out on EQ, I'd taken it too seriously and I honestly blamed the game itself, its very design.<br><br>But, seeing that Gwion was having a good time on MT, I reluctantly joined her on our server, starting a druid, Aganitte. At first, it was honestly just for kicks. A druid, not too dependent on items or cash, could goof around, and perhaps, this time, enjoy the game without stepping onto the manic treadmill of loot and levels.<br><br>The first thing that struck me when I met Gwion's friends is that they seemed 'real'. Wether it was just a change in my attitude, or just the nature of of these folks, these people started to -matter-. Previously, with one or two exceptions, the people on my old server were 'vehicles' for grouping and leveling and basically, continuing on the treadmill. Like some junkie in rehab, my life in MT eased me off the desire for 'material' possessions (they're pixels, c'mon). When I logged onto EQ, I found myself thinking "I wonder what Cobacca's up to" instead of "I hope Cobacca's on so we can get xp at the Bandit camp".<br><br>There's a line in a Husker Du song that says "If you don't stop to smell the roses, they might end up on you". My rebirth on MT was very much me stoping to smell the roses and I was very much in peril of ending my EQ life embittered, hitting that cancel button on the Bertoxx account.<br><br>Weeks went by, and Gwion joined Random Acts. Now, you've probably noticed it by now, but Gwion and I, although together in RL, stay pretty separate in EQ. I hung out with her, and met her friends, but I was rather reluctant to join RA. <br><br>I'm not one for groups of people. I feel left out, half the time, and the point of large groups often seems simply to 'gang up', just like Eedelia mentioned earlier. I also knew that groups were prone to infighting, greed, power mongering. I'm a skeptical person by nature, and it took me a good month or two to join RA, even after hanging out with guildmembers for ages and ages.<br><br>It took one FA camp to turn me around, and hunger to be part of this guild. <br><br>And now, I'm content here. The people I know I have high respect for, and I will be in this guild in its best times, and in its worst times. Folks often mourn the good ole days, the fear that the RA spirit may be lost. I've been with the guild long enough to know its all cycles, ever evolving cycles. Our troubles today seem large and sometimes insurmountable, but so did the ones of yesteryear.<br><br>Just remember the next time you see that Uber Dude running off with his horse, or his full Velious Armor, and you have this nagging longing to 'be uber'...ask yourself how many kind hearts does he know in EQ? More than you? <br><br> <p><CENTER><br><a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank"> <img src="http://engels.freewebspace.com/images/Aga5041.gif" border="0"><br> <img src="http://engels.freewebspace.com/images/tinnasmallfixed.gif" border="0"> </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/umorgania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morgania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 373<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/1/02 3:12:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1597.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why I joined Random Acts</span><hr size=1> Well, it seems very fitting for me to follow Aganitte's post as meeting her in Kelethin was the only reason I didnt quit EQ for EVER!

It was then that I posted to become part of RA, as I was shocked by what Gorte had done. I was lvl 14, and he asked if I had a certain spell. He had an extra in the bank and gave it to me. No charge just gave it to me. Unknown to Gorte I didnt have the spell, because I had run out of money and couldnt buy it for myself yet. I remember talking to Gamalek and telling him can you believe he just gave me that and expected nothing in return. Gamalek had already put in to be part of Random Acts, and he encouraged me to do the same .

Apologies for an old, failing, memory...  If I remember correctly, I saw a First Aid camp notice on Everlore, maybe?  Before I showed up, it's kind of foggy.  But once upon a time, as a young RAW newbie, someone handed me the most wonderous thing I'd ever seen...  A spiked gnoll collar.  +3 to Strength!  WOW!  So I figure I'll return the favor.  I showed up with, what, 2 or 3 backpacks FULL of gnoll collars, and lightstones, and not sure what all else.  Numtini was making newbie packs at that time...  A backpack, some rations and milk, and an item or two like those collars.  And we all know the value of that first newbie backpack!  Well, being a tank, what could I do past item donations?  Taunt!  You know how knots of mayhem form on Orc Hill...  I stood there and taunted the adds away from the young ones, pulled for 'em, bound some wounds, and generally had a blast.  We were there to escort people to Kaladim to turn in those precious Crushbone belts, and I even went into BBM just to shout out that Random Acts was having the event in the next zone over, so stop on in.  After that, it was kind of back to normal.  I mean it never dawned on me that this behavior was anything more than normal.

LOL, now she regrets it everyday.  My hubby played it for the first few days, urging me to play every second.  I have played d&amp;d and AD&amp;D for a long time and I was bored of it so I keep saying no.<br><br>Well Jan 1, 2001 I finally decided to play this EQ game.  I picked MT because it called out to me.  Tellia was my first and only character for a long time (20 lvls).  Tellia was born in Kelethin and the first thing I remember is OMG this is high up.  I didn't know how to get down.  I didn't know how to get down.<br><br>Finally I learned some things after trial and error.  I went thru lvls 1 - 5 in one day if I remember correctly.  I stop playing for about 36 hours.  I came back and there was all this people gathered around the POD lift.  I never saw some many character in one place.  I had to take a look.<br><br>That is when I met RA.  I got buffed from everyone all at once I didn't know what to say.  I didn't know people could buff.  I was still a very noob.  The first person I got to know was Varigon.  I remember all the FS plate he had.  I think the was sitting on one of the barrels.  After he got off it, I proceeded to try.  It looked fun.  He tried for 5 minutes to show me how to jump.<br><br>Well if you find Varigon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  you find Meriel.  I met her that day too.  I mostly talked to Varigon that day thou.  I asked so many questions, I am surprised he still talks to me.  I asked him how do I go about getting a sponsor.  Then he said to do the /who all random.  Then I asked him if he could be my sponsor.  He said yes....<br><br>Well this was the days when Varigon played his alts more, he said that he knew what I was doing all the time.  And he did.  After I went to the RA camp and 2 lvls later, I met Toggler.  Toggler and I hit if right off, and we never be seperated since.<br><br>When toggler wasn't on and I was bored, I wanted to help everyone I saw.  Being a bard made that hard.  I couldn't buff anyone, and all my healings took to long.  So I decided to do /ooc If anyone needs help finding your body please send tells.  All for free no charge.  Being in Kelethin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  you know i was never bored again.<br><br>I remember back then, you had to wait until the beginning of the next month to be tagged.  I didn't sleep at all.  I was looking for any officer, so they can tag me at 12:00:01 on Feb 1, 2001.  I had to wait <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Hama tagged me at 4:20am... so I didn't have to wait to long.  <br><br>Varigon didn't warn me that my chat bar would never be the same again until after I joined.  Once I was in RA I knew it was where I belonged.  Everyone was always so nice.  Finrael, Varigon, and Meriel took me to Felwithe to see the top of the world... I didn't see it that day, but they took like 2 hours just trying to teach me.<br><br>I joined RA because we don't fight to see who can loot things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  we fight to give things away.

It's nice to know he has a mind of his own, and isn't just my mind-slave... MUUUHHAHAHHAHAHAHHA !<br><br>Why I joined RA - well, which time ? The first time I joined RA, I had just begun playing with a shaman character on my son's account. (Which is why EED is a lvl 30-something and I'm not ! :D ) I was in Halas as a lvl 9 shaman, and I saw this guy named Hezrhond with a really COOL bent staff thingy, but dressed similar to me with a wolf helmet. I said something about, hey, cool staff, and he said thanks. We talked for a little bit, and somehow things got around to quests. Well, the next thing ya know, Hez & I are standing in the Shaman's guild and he's coaching me on what to say and who to say it to. WHen I found out I had to go THROUGH Blackburrow and on to QEYNOS !!!, I said, "well, hey, thanks but, I'm not ready for that !" And he said, "oh no worries, I'll go every step of the way with you." And I think I said something like "????, Why in the world would you do that ? You don't even KNOW me ! And I can't pay you, I'm saving for my lvl 9 spells still." Hezrhond just laughed, and I think he boggled too, "Why, Man, Have ye never heard of the Guild, Random Acts ?" Then he proceeded to buy the rest of my lvl 9 spells for me !<br><br>Well, no, I hadn't ! I had just started playing, and I didn't really trust anyone. Espescially those snotty guild-tagged people who sneered at us new people and called us dumb N00BS. SO he proceeded to tell me a few things, which sounded so awesome. I mean these guys played the game the way I liked to play, helping people, healing, buffing, guiding... things I did even as a level 1. (The time I tried to help a person get there corpse from BB and I was just a lvl 8 is a funny if tragic sidebar to my career, hehe).<br><br>So, here we are standing in the bank in Halas. Hez was about to lead me to adventure, when someone sent a shout,"Can anyone heal me at the docks?" I ooc'd back - "Sure just a sec..." and "Excuse me Hezrhond - I gotta do something then we can go..." and ran to the dock where I buffed, healed and performed my first ever SOW. I would have been there sooner, if I had SoWed my self first, heheh.<br><br>"Used up all my mana, sorry... let me regenerate and I'll be ready to go. Tell me more about Random Acts... it sounds like fun. Hope I can be worthy to get in a guild like that someday !" Hezrhond smiled at me and then said the fateful words, "Hmmmm.... maybe you will!"<br><br>Well - the rest of the story - ran through the tunnels, fell into the pool at BB and almost got wasted by Gnolls, learned when NOT to use Follow, made it through the tunnel to Qeynos, remembering being terrified, and awestruck, at the new world I found myself in. and Hezrhond repeatedly reassuring me everything was fine, not mocking me, and leading me through every step of the way to the bank guard in Qeynos for the poster, gating back, giving it to the guy at the shaman guild and BOOM!! I have a new amulet that gives me a magic hammer !!! WOW !!!! What a rush - my first quest !<br><br>I had one friend at the time - her name was Wani and her husband was in Tyrn S'Gnath, or whatever it is. They wanted me to join them, and I was all set until that fateful day with Hezrhond.... I kept stalling until I made her a little mad at me and they started PLing like mad to get her up to the acceptable level. <br><br>I applied for membership and was accepted about a week after that meeting with Hezrhond. When Wani saw my tag, which I was VERY proud of, she said, we'll you've made your decision, congratulations !! I never saw her again! :(<br><br>I was a whirlwind of emotion in those days. Sometimes I would get so aggravated I would think about quitting altogether, and you, my family, would reassure me it was going to be ok. Especially this cutie Lilone, a lil gnomey chick who was so convinced the guildremove command was broken, I tried to help her out by sending the command in a tell. Forgot the /R and ended up detagging accidently. MAN THAT WAS SCARY !!! But funny too, noe, eh, Whissers ???<br><br>I loved being in RA - but I was bored and frustrated with ELryyc, stuck at 18. Tried some new characters - none were right.... Finally decided I just wasn't having any fun, especially after my hunting pal, Silvertip left to play AC. Gave up all my worldly possessions, said goodbye and deleted Elryyc and all my alts. End of Story<br><br>Well.... not exactly.... 3 months later, lvl 30 battle-caster Li' Mui' Bai gets a tell from his friend, the former Silvertip, that he is through with AC and moving on to DAOC. Got to thinking about my old RA friends and checking out the board and.... Well, DANG IT !!! Yer my family, and I missed you ! So here I am again !<br><br>Why I joined RA the second time around ???

I was one of those that first posted and one of the first to join, and for that I am quite proud.<br><br>I explained this to some of the officers/council and I will attempt to explain here.<br><br>First, let me answer the question at the top of this page.  I joined RA for the simple fact that Hama wanted to be nice to people, and I liked that idea.  Take all of the Call and Charter, all of our Mission Statement...and basically boil it down and you get...Be nice to people.<br><br>So I joined.<br><br>We are all nice to people in our own way..that is, we all wear this badge for the same reason, but show it in different ways.  Like anyone else, I do the random buffing, answer questions, give advice, and basically try to represent our guild as if it directly affects me...cause it does.  I look at the Random Acts tag as being another surname.  It represents who I am, how I act and how I treat people.<br><br>Now that is not to say that I am the nicest and best person in Norrath.  I am far from it.  There are so many people in RA that are nicer than me, more helpful and more active in the guild.<br><br>Point is, as I mentioned earlier, I am very proud to be in Random Acts.  It is my pride for my guild and myself being in that guild that makes me act the way I do.  When I lose my temper over something I think is wrong in the guild...I do it out of pride.  I want nothing, NOTHING that I think will tarnish the name or the meaning of the guild in any way.  I have a mix of feelings of how a person should act in RA, but I have a firm belief in how a person should not act.<br><br>It is because of pride that I will always defend the guild that I have been apart of for almost two years, from the ground up.  I won't be able to ever stand by and watch as someone, in my eyes, is hurting the guild.  I will speak my mind.<br><br>Things cannot always be pie and icecream.  We cannot always forgive and forget.  We are a kind guild, but we are also not a bunch of push overs either.  I won't stand to let someone inside or outside the guild walk over the members of Random Acts.  When I see this happening, I will speak my mind.<br><br>I joined Random Acts to be nice to people, plain and simple.  I am nice to people.  Like most of you, I help when I can.  But, in the end, our guild is bigger than we ever dreamed it would get...and with bigness, comes complexity at times.  We have had difficult journies and will have more difficult journies ahead of us still.<br><br>Be kind to people.<br>Do what you think is right.<br>Have pride in your guild.<br>Represent the guild like it was your own name.<br><br>take care all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table width="75%" border="0" align="center">  <tr>     <td bgcolor="#000000">       <div align="center"><a href="http://user.netomia.com/Uriel/shiang_flash.htm"><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Uriel/shiang_good.jpg" width="552" height="221" border="0"></a></div>  </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top" bgcolor="#000000">       <div align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Click the pic to see Shiang Shonuf         and the search for the <font color="#FFFF00"><a href="http://user.netomia.com/Uriel/shiang_flash.htm">Glow</a><br>        <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56802">Uriel's         Magelo File</a>----------<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=68511">Shiang's         Magelo File</a></font></font></div>    </td>  </tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uhidr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hidr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/02 4:19:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1597.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why I joined Random Acts</span><hr size=1> Many char ago I met Miriel working on his fledging quest.
