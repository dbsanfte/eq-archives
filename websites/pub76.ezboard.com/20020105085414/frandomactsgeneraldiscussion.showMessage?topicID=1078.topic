<br>

<br>
<br>
Remarkable, truly remarkable...<br>
<br>
                                   Written amongst pages of the ancient tomes of the Combine Empire, I<br>
                                   discovered something that contradicts what has been theorized about the<br>
                                   Combine ruins. For years, it was believed that the Combine Empire created<br>
                                   the structures that facilitate teleportation for wizards, however, I found<br>
                                   evidence in the ancient tomes that proves these theories to be incorrect.<br>
<br>
                                   Within their manuscripts, scientists of the Combine Empire made notes of<br>
                                   the discovery of sets of four tall spires found in several areas across<br>
                                   Norrath. The spires emanated a magical energy that was unexplainable.<br>
                                   After years of extensive research and experimental studies of the<br>
                                   structures, they came across a method of using this power for teleporting<br>
                                   to several locations. In order to use this power to its fullest, they built the<br>
                                   pyramidal structures in the middle of each set of these monuments.<br>
<br>
                                                 As I study the Combine spires... no... as a man of<br>
                                                 knowledge I can not continue giving credit to the<br>
                                                 Combine Empire for creating something they did<br>
                                                 not. The quadroliths, as I see more fit to dub them,<br>
                                                 contain a tremendous amount of power. Some<br>
                                                 time ago, I sent my assistant Sorko Talvazon to<br>
                                                 scrape some fragments off the portal in the<br>
                                                 Dreadlands. I hope this will be possible. Before I<br>
                                   continue with my research, I must study this magical energy closer.<br>
<br>
                                   Recently, I intercepted a letter from one of my former assistants, Terblyn<br>
                                   Zelbus, that was addressed to Sorko Talvazon. This letter was sent by a<br>
                                   messenger and delivered to my laboratory so I was well within my rights<br>
                                   to determine the nature of it. In between the usual gibberish that gnomes<br>
                                   tend to use, Terblyn seemed to be making arrangements for meeting Sorko<br>
                                   to get more information and to pay him for what he had already received,<br>
                                   including new spells that I had been working on. I asked myself what<br>
                                   information had Sorko sent to this little beast? I had not authorized any<br>
                                   additional scrolls to be sent to him.<br>
<br>
                                   Blast! Why do I always end up surrounded by incompetent chuckleheads?<br>
                                   While searching my laboratory to make sure everything was in place, I<br>
                                   noticed a scroll hidden behind a few bottles on a dusty old shelf. I opened<br>
                                   this scroll and it was a detailed list of the experiments my assistants and I<br>
                                   have been working on. <br>
<br>
                                   In order to confront Sorko, I decided to continue my planned journey to<br>
                                   Kunark and wait for him at the outpost of Firiona Vie, near the area where<br>
                                   he was supposed to meet with me. After he did not appear, I selected,<br>
                                   from those pleading for a chance to assist me, a wizard of no particular<br>
                                   standing, to assist me with my task in the Dreadlands. Once in that<br>
                                   location, I spotted Sorko Talvazon kneeling down picking away at the<br>
                                   portal collecting the fragments as if he was innocent of any wrongdoing. <br>
<br>
                                   &quot;Fool!&quot; I addressed him. &quot;Did you honestly think that I would not find out?&quot;<br>
                                   He stood before me and pleaded that he didn't know of what I spoke.<br>
                                   After silencing him, I told him that I knew of his selling that gnome both the<br>
                                   spell scrolls and documentation of my enchantment process for the portal<br>
                                   fragments.<br>
<br>
                                   Sorko Talvazon has been one of my assistants for several years. I put<br>
                                   forth a great deal of trust in having him assist me with my research in<br>
                                   confidence. I have warned him many times what the consequences of<br>
                                   betraying me would be. All the skill in wizardry that he possessed was<br>
                                   gained under my tutelage. Betrayal of my trusting and congenial nature<br>
                                   proved to me that he was not worthy of having such magical forces at his<br>
                                   fingertips. To preserve the secrecy of my work, I knew that I had to strip<br>
                                   him of all knowledge of my research and of all the wizardry I have taught<br>
                                   him over the years. Sadly, this dreaded act is one that I have performed<br>
                                   before and, despite the betrayal, it was not something that I was looking<br>
                                   forward to doing again.<br>
<br>
                                   As I have written in past journals, this may be accomplished by the<br>
                                   simultaneous impact of a shocking blow knocking one's target<br>
                                   unconscious, nullification of any magic surrounding them and finally,<br>
                                   blurring their memory. While it is not a perfected process, I have had<br>
                                   success with in the past. In order to safeguard the process, I misled the<br>
                                   young menial aiding me on what was about to be done. Once the deed<br>
                                   was done, I informed Sorko that he was no longer one of my assistants<br>
                                   and that he was banned from my laboratory. Why I was merciful with him,<br>
                                   I do not know. It is merely another of my many endearing traits, no doubt.<br>
<br>
                                   After examining the portal fragments, I brought them back to my<br>
                                   laboratory. Just as I projected, the power from the portals remained in the<br>
                                   fragments but in order for that energy to be amplified for usage, they<br>
                                   needed to go through enchantment. By submerging the small fragments in<br>
                                   a solvent made of mushlett acid and haze panther bile, then subjecting<br>
                                   them to immense amounts of heat, they became enchanted sources of<br>
                                   energy. <br>
<br>
                                   Once enchanted, the fragments did not produce enough power to reach<br>
                                   the dragon portals, but did manage to provide enough magical energy to<br>
                                   translocate to the weaker portals of Antonica - the dark forest of<br>
                                   Nektulos, the western half of the Commonlands, the western plains of<br>
                                   Karana, the most northern portion of the Desert of Ro, and even the<br>
                                   temple of Cazic-Thule. With the stolen spell scrolls and documentation of<br>
                                   my enchantment process, no doubt Terblyn Zelbus will be selling the<br>
                                   spells and fragments in his puny shop. Perhaps somehow I can<br>
                                   discourage him, but meanwhile, I have more urgent things to tend to. <br>
<br>
                                   My research continues...<br>
