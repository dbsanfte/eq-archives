There's an area our friends seem to have neglected when advising our young man:<br>
<br>
Breakfast.<br>
<br>
Not just the most important meal of the day!  Should your ladyfriend... er... guest overnight, shall we say... it's soooo much better to dazzle her with an actual meal instead of a box of Fruit Loops.  Or the ignominous prospect of going to Denny's in last evening's attire. <br>
<br>
Now, there are many things one can prepare for the morning, but my specialty is omlettes.  They're surprisingly easy to make, and can range from the simple cheese omlette to the full-blown &quot;all four food groups in one serving&quot; farmer's omlette.<br>
<br>
Here's the basic neccessities:<br>
<br>
- Eggs.  Two or three, depending upon  how hungry your companion is.  Size is dependent upon the next item...<br>
<br>
- Non-stick skillet.  The key dimesion is the bottom of the pan.  I have two, and my preffered omlette-making skillet is 9&quot; across at the bottom.  This is perfect for 2-3 extra large (not jumbo) eggs.<br>
<br>
I also have a small 4-inch skillet (non-stick) which is good for the one-egg omlettes my 8-year-old daughter prefers.<br>
<br>
- Cooking spray, butter or margarine.  With a high-quality, new pan, you may get away without this... Butter is my preference, followed by margarine, with cooking spray a distant third (and potential fire hazard!)  I have also seen vegetable oil used, but that ranks even below cooking spray in my book.<br>
<br>
- Egg mixing bowl.  Impress your date with how cultured you are; take her to a craft show.  Pick up one of these at one of the pottery stands.  They look like little pitchers without handles, and usually come complete with the mini-whisk you'll need.  Don't worry, though, you can make do with a simple bowl and a fork. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
- Wide cooking spatula.  Nothing fancy, but you want one 4 inches or more across.<br>
<br>
- Optionally, a plate for turning.  See below.<br>
<br>
- Your other ingredients.  This is the true beauty of the omlette: you can make it into anything.  Feeling carnivorous?  Ham, ground sausage (sweet sausage... mmmm.... ) and bacon all go nicely.  In the veggie mood?  Peppers and onions are the old standbys, but diced tomatoes go well too.  Fully veggie omlettes I've seen included broccoli!  Many cheeses work nicely also.  Be creative!  If you need inspiration, visit an IHOP (sorry, US-centric referrence) and take a look at their menu.<br>
<br>
Preparation: <br>
<br>
1.  PREHEAT THE PAN.  This is a crucial step which is the downfall of many aspiring omlette cooks.  You want even, medium heat.  Too hot and you're eating rubber or carbon.  Too cool and you'll be staring at yellow soup.  Get this underway while you undertake your other preparations.<br>
<br>
2.  PREPARE YOUR INGREDIENTS.  This is the second avoidable mistake.  You don't want to be chopping veggies or rooting through the fridge for the shredded cheddar while the eggs are cooking.  Clear off your workspace and do whatever chopping, tearing, slicing or dicing is required now.  This has the added benefit of allowing your pan to properly heat.  <br>
<br>
Obviously, some will need to be prepared before you are ready to start the eggs (e.g., bacon or sausage).<br>
<br>
3.  Prepare the eggs.  Crack'em, break the yolks and use your whisk or fork to beat them into a realtively even mixture.  If you're cooking for a crowd, use a bunch of bowls (tip learned from watching Army cooks) and have a helper keep breaking and beating eggs.  One serving per bowl, until you get really good.<br>
<br>
4.  &quot;Grease&quot; the pan.  Add your butter/margarine/cooking spray to the pan and observe.  If you get smoke, your pan is too hot.  If you're using a solid like butter or margarine and it melts very slowly, you're too cold.   For a 2-3 egg omlette in a 9&quot; pan, about 1/2 to 2/3 tablespoon of butter works well.  Spread it (or brush, or spray) evenly and be sure to coat the whole pan, including about a half-inch or so up the sides.<br>
<br>
OPTION: especially if you're cooking for a crowd, melt your butter / margarine as part of step 2 and use a basting brush to coat the pan.<br>
<br>
5.  Pour the eggs into the pan.  Ensure that it's evenly spread.  If you're cooking for two, now is an OK time to crack and beat the next eggs if you haven't already.<br>
<br>
6.  Cook until nothing on top is runny.  Now, you can either use your wide spatula to turn your eggs, or slide them off onto a spare plate and then invert the plate over the pan.  Either way takes some practice.<br>
<br>
7.  Now, add your additional ingredients to ONE HALF of the circle.  Some heathens will do this in step 5, embedding them in the egg structure itself.  This is heresy and deserves severe punishment, like being forced to listen to &quot;Boy George&quot; music.  Resist the temptation!  Allow this to cook for about 45 seconds or so.<br>
<br>
8.  Carefully fold one half of your egg circle over top of your ingredient mix.  Press down gently with your spatula.  <br>
<br>
9.  After about 30 seconds, carefully flip the omlette to it's other side.  Cook for another 30-45 seconds.<br>
<br>
10.  Voila!  Lift or slide your completed creation onto the waiting plate.<br>
<br>
11.  Carefully remove any stray bits of egg, cheese, what have you from the skillet.  If needed, regrease the skillet.  Ensure your next set of eggs is ready, then repeat steps 5-10 above.<br>
<br>
This does take practice... but not too much, and if a certified clutz like yours truly can master this then anyone can. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Here's some basic omlette recipies.  I only give what's in them, not how much - that's a matter for how big your pan is.<br>
<br>
Cheese Omlette: Well, cheese, doofus!  Slices of American cut or torn diagonally work great.  Shredded cheddar works very nicely.  Whatever floats your boat!<br>
<br>
Ham and Cheese Omlette:  Cheese as above, and diced ham.  Lunch-meat ham torn into tiny pieces also works very well, especially when you didn't realize you'd be serving breakfast. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Denver or Western Omlette: ham, diced onions and diced green peppers.  Cheese is optional.<br>
<br>
&quot;International&quot; Omlette: stolen from IHOP. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Ham, diced onion, green peppers with shredded cheddar cheese, topped with mild salsa.  MMMM.  Optionally served with sour cream.<br>
<br>
Farmer's Omlette, AKA The Garbage Can Omlette: bacon, sausage, onions, cheese and hash browns!<br>
<br>
Veggie Omlette: Diced tomatoes, chopped broccoli, onions, squash or zucchini.  Pre-cook the harder veggies (broccoli, sqaush, etc.).<br>
<br>
Seafood Omlette: You can serve this for dinner. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Shrimp, lobster and crabmeat work best.  Of course, unless you live within 50 miles of the Chesapeake, your crabs aren't worthy... <br>
<br>
Well.  Hope this gives you something to work with!  And, I suppose, if we ever do have an RA get-together, I'm stuck with breakfast... do I get to pick my helper and her uniform? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You forgot to mention mushrooms!  No veggie omelet is complete without mushrooms.  My fave -- mushrooms, spinach, and swiss cheese <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I like wild mushrooms best, but of course I live in Washington where morels, chanterelles, and oyster mushrooms are easy to get.<br>
<br>
But any mushrooms will do -- white button, crimini (the darker brown ones), or even diced portobellos (mmm!).  Just don't use the canned ones, which by all accounts are totally gross.<br>
<br>
One other vegetable tip -- don't overcook your veggies.  Remember they're going to cook a little bit in the omelet, also.  Mushrooms, onions, and garlic can be sauteed, but you can (should) cook other kinds of veggies like broccoli and squash in the microwave (throw them in a bowl or whatever with about a tablespoon of water, cover with plastic wrap, nuke for about a minute).  <br>
<br>
Broccoli and other green veggies should be emerald green, not olive-colored.  Summer squash should be brilliant yellow.  This method might produce slightly crunchier veggies than you're used to, but they'll be way less bitter and have a lot more flavor (in addition to being neat-looking!).<br>
<br>
