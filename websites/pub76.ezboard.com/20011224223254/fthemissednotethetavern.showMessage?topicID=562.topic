At the moment, it seemed that bard in the corner of The Velium Keg was doing his best to use each and every one of those words iin his so-called song.  As near as Kalaz could figure, the song sounded like &quot;Snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow.  Kill all the giants and bury them in snow.&quot; repeated over and over.  He had hated the song the first time he had heard it, had learned to tune it out after the fifth time, had come back around to hating it by the twelfth time and now ouright couldn't stand to hear it played any longer.<br>
<br>
He grabeed a handful of coins and threw them at the bard, perhaps a bit harder than was really necessary.  The clatter of the coins on the stage interrupted the bard's music and he turned to look at Kalaz.<br>
<br>
&quot;Play something else,&quot; Kalaz said, &quot;And if I ever hear you playing that song again, you'll be eatin' your drum for dinner.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, of course, sir,&quot; the bard replied, &quot;What should I play?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're an elf, play something elvish.&quot;  Kalaz said as he turned back to his drink.  He signalled to the bartender to bring him another while the elf started playing in the background.  It was something soft and sappy, a love song of some sort.  It didn't matter, as long as it never mentioned snow the dwarf didn't mind.  It was a simpleenough somg that he could almost ignore it completely, sense it as a quiet drone in the background.<br>
<br>
Halfway through the chorus, two thing happened at almost the same instant.  The door to the tavern opened and the bard missed a note in the song.  Either one would have been easy to ignore, but together they provided just enough of an interruption that Kalaz paused in his drinking for a moment to look up.<br>
<br>
A Dark Elf.  In the bar.  Wonderful, he thought, the one place in the whole damn city he could go to get a quiet drink and now they were admitting Dark Elves.  He appreciated the Coldain attitude, such as it was.  Everyone was considered suspect until they proved themselves one way or another.  The unterusted ones wold be watched closely, and perhaps cheated a bit by the locals, but they were left alone until they showed their true colors.  While that was al fine and good for the inhabitants of Thurgadin, it was a bit uncomfortable for the people coming from Antonica or Faydwer.  Many of them, himself included, had still not gotten used to the idea of sharing a bar with a Troll or Ogre...or a Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf looked around the tavern casually before making his way to the bar.  Right next to Kalaz.<br>
<br>
&quot;Barkeep,&quot; the Elf said, &quot;Bring me a bottle fo your best wine.  If you have anything back there worth drinking and not just swilling down.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He sneered slightly at Kalaz and his ale just as the elf missed another note in the second verse of the song.<br>
<br>
The barkeep ignored it as he brought out a bottle of wine and poured a glass.  The Dark Elf took a snip, a slight look of distaste crossed his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;This will do, I suppose.&quot;  The Dark Elf pushed his cloak back as he reached across his body to get his purse.  The bard in the corner missed another note in his song (it was quickly becoming apparent why he had chosen to stick to singing the simple Coldain songs).  Kalaz looked over at the Dark Elf, noticing the odd movement nad saw the reason for it.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf was missing his left hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right, then.&quot; Kalaz said.  He drained his mug, set it down softly and turned in his chair to face the Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf looked down at him haughtily, raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes?&quot; he said sarcastically.<br>
<br>
Kalaz punched him in the jaw as hard as he could.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf crumpled to the ground, unconscious.  He hopped off of his stool and turned to the bartender.<br>
<br>
&quot;Was that really necessary?&quot; the bartender asked as Kalaz fished out some coins.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Kalaz said, &quot;It was.  I have this feeling the gods are trying to tell me something.&quot;<br>
<br>
The barkeep nodded in understanding.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well then.  If it's the will of the gods, then that's all there is to it.&quot; he said as he collected the coins off the bartop.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; Kalaz said as he wrapped his cloak around his shoulders, &quot;Who do I talk to about booking passage on the Icebreaker?  It seems it's time for me to head back to Antonica.&quot;<br>

<br>
Kalaz looked around at the steep ravine walls surrounding the entrance to Thurgadin.<br>
<br>
&quot;How in the name of Brell did they ever find this place to begin with?&quot; he muttered quietly.  It was far too cold out and he was never happy when he was cold.  Still, he had a long journey ahead of him and there was no sense wasting time complaining.  Pulling his cloak tighter around himself he set off through the snow.<br>
<br>
&quot;And once they did find it,&quot; he continued, under his breath, &quot;Who was the bright lad that stepped up and said 'Oh yes, building a city behind a waterfall we'll have to pass through each and every time we want to come in or go out is a *good* idea.'&quot;<br>
<br>
He paused for a moment to take a drink form his hip flask.  The fine dwarven whiskey warmed him.  Slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Giants every-bloody-where, bloody huge wolves, and Brell knows what those spinning rock things are.  Why didn't they just stop somewhere a bit less deadly and build a nice house there?  Between the lot fo them you'd think they could have cleaned out that tower pretty quick and had a nice, warm, east to access place to live.  But no, they had to bloody trek across Brell knows how many miles and build their bloody city within spitting distance of a wizard's laboratory.  Bloody foolish Coldain....&quot;<br>
<br>
The tremendous wizard spires towered ahead, seeming to offer a small sanctuary from the cold.  THose who had been here for a time knew better.  The spires were not only never used, but were also a favored place for giants and their pets to ambush weary travellers.  Kalaz carefully skirted the walls around them and continued on.  No need to go looking for a fight where it wasn't needed.<br>
<br>
In his younger days he would have gladly rushed into even the possibility of a fray, but now....  Well, everyone grew older.<br>
<br>
Not far ahead he saw the crevasse that led to the Eastern Wastes.<br>
<br>
&quot;A third of the way there,&quot; he said softly, &quot;Not much longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Eastern Wastes - <br>
<br>
&quot;Wastes.  Aye, bloody waste of time is what it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
The terrain was much more harsh here.  Hills that dropped off suddenly on he far side, snowdrifts far taller than even the Barbarians of Halas, rivers hidden under a thin covering of ice.  Not a hospitable place.  He wondered how so many creatures had ever managed to make their homes here.  The griffons, well, they could fly over the worst of it.  But the orcs?  The walrus men?  The giants?  And even thought hey *could* live here, there was no reason for them to stay, not when there were so many other more hospitable places around the world.<br>
<br>
By sheer luck more than anything he noticed a set of footprints in the snow.  Orcs.  Looked like a small band, or a pair who were following their own tracks while they patrolled the area.  If it was a full party, then there were few worries, the tracks were quite well covered and obviously old enough that those who had made them were far away by now.  If it was the small patrol then chances were good they'd be heading back this way soon.<br>
<br>
Kalaz paused for a moment.  It was getting colder out here and a fight just might warm his blood enough to keep him moving.  He smiled and headed for the small stand of pine trees nearby.  Taking a drink from his flask once again he re-strung his bow and made sure his arrows were readily at hand.  His swords were loose in their scabbards.  He stood, still as the trees that gave him cover while he waited.  <br>
<br>
It wasn't long before he heard the tramp, tramp, tramp of heavy footsteps headed his way.  Taking another quick drink he nocked an arrow and waited.  Almost as soon as they came into view he drew, aimed and fired.  The winds were a bit harsher than he had expected and his first arrow hit the orc a glancing blow in the arm.  The pair turned and started running towards him.  Fools, they should have run for reinforcements, Kalaz thought.<br>
<br>
He drew his bow again, noting the windage properly this time and let fly.  The arrow connected solidly taking the second orc in the chest.  He stumbled but didn't fall.  That was enough, the next arrow took him cleanly in the throat.  Kalaz dropped his bow and drew his swords waiting for the orc to come to him.  ANy halfway intelligent being would have been a bit concerned, someone attacks and the stands there waitin for you to come after them?  Not a normal situation.  Orcs were never known for being overly intelligent though.<br>
<br>
The orc charged swinging a strangely shaped axe at Kalaz.  It was a trivial matter to deflect the blow, and also afforded the dwarf the opportunity to score another light hit on the orc's already wounded arm.  THe orc screamed something and swung again, Kalaz doged under the blow and poked the orc in the leg.  They continued on in this way for some time.  THe orc swinging, missing and becoming more and more frustrated while Kalaz slowly whittled away at him.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the old dwarf was warm again and thoug slightly winded felt well enough to continue on.  He let the orc swing once again, caught the axe blade between his two swords, then drove both points forward killing the orc quickly with two wounds to the chest.<br>
<br>
He picked up his bow and continued on his way to the great dragon bridge, feeling slightly happier with himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Iceclad Ocean - <br>
<br>
&quot;Stupid bloody gnolls,&quot; Kalaz said, &quot;Living on an iceberg?  Next to a tower filled with undead?  I'm thinking the gods somehow missed them when it came to the brains department.&quot;<br>
<br>
Still, they had been useful.  They let him borrow one of hteir smaller fishing boats to at least get to the main island.  Kalaz trudged along through the snow, ahead he could see the lights of the Gnome encampment glowing faintly in the fading sunlight.  Soon....  A hot meal, dry clothes and a boat ride back to warmer climes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Halt!&quot; came the highpitched shout from just ahead.<br>
<br>
Kalaz stopped for a moment then continued walking forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said 'Halt'!&quot; came the voice again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Kalaz replied tiredly, &quot;I heard ya the first time.&quot;  He continued walking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Halt, or I shall be forced to use...er, force!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kalaz paused.  It was better than enduring the continued shouts all the way back to the camp.  He stood there, as calmly as he could, while the Gnome guard approached.  A young one, his armor was still shiny and Kalaz swore he could still see the mold lines around the head of the spear that was being pointed his way.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's better,&quot; the Gnome said.  &quot;Now, state your business or face the consequences.&quot;  He waved his spear in what he obviously thought was a threatening manner.<br>
<br>
Kalaz reached up and scratched his chin, staring blandly at the Gnome.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what consequences would those be, then?&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a spear,&quot; the Gnome said, waving it about again, &quot;And I'm not afraid to use it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kalaz debated for a moment.  No, it wasn't worth it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right then,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;I'm a traveller from Kaladim.  Headed to the camp, then the docks to catch the boat back to the mainland.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a ship, not a boat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kalaz slowly counted to five.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ship then, I'm going to catch the ship back to the mainland.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do I know you're not a giant in disguise?&quot; the Gnome said looking at Kalaz suspiciously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because,&quot; Kalaz answered, &quot;A giant wouldn't be as patient as I've been.  And if you don't get the bloody hell out of my way right now, I'll be showing you why giants are not the most fearful thing on this stinking island.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Gnome pondered this.  After a moment a look of surprise, then fear crossed his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright,&quot; he said, &quot;You can pass.  You're too short to be a ginat anyways.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;  Kalaz continued on his way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aboard the Icebreaker - <br>
<br>
Kalaz stood at the prow of the ship, watching the light play off the icebergs.  Even though it was colder than it had any right to be, and the sea air was doing him no good whatsoever, it was stil quite pretty.<br>
<br>
Why now? he thought.  It had been ages since he'd been to the Note.  As the old crew had drifted away he had found less and less reason to continue visiting.  People had changed.  Far more than he had ever expected they would.  Maybe there was something the new customers had to offer that he needed....<br>
<br>
He stopped in his reminscence for amoment.  Something was wrong.  He turned, looked around and noticed what it was.  Carefully, he made his way to the helm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oy there!&quot; he called to the Gnome steering the ship.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?  I'm very busy here.  Steering the ship, you know.&quot;  He turned back to the wheel with a very serious look on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, got a question about that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes?  What is it?  This is ver demanding work you know?  Demands all my concentration.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right, I'll keep it quick then.  The docks on the small island?  They're due east of the docks by the camp on the main island, aye?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes, what of it?  I can't be spending time answering all these questions.  Got to steer the ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then why the bloody hell are we heading south?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; the Gnome said in an exasperated tone, &quot;We have to go around the ice floes, you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kalaz paused again, drumming his fingers softly on his breastplate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right then, need to go around the ice floes.&quot;  The tone of his voice was what was often called 'deadly calm'.  &quot;The name of the bloody boat is Icebreaker.  You've some bloody huge hammer-barrel things on the front end to break the ice.  And you're going around the ice floes.  What the bloody hell for?!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Gnome stopped what he was doing.  He thought for a minute, remembering all his masters had taught him back in Ak'Anon about hydrodynamics, the freezing point of water, tensile strength of wood and so on.  With a very serious look on his face he turned to Kalaz.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's...um, technical....&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Kalaz closed his eyes and shook his head sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be below decks.  Let me know when we get to the small island or I'll have your hide for handwraps.&quot;  He turned and walked down the stairs to his cabin.<br>
<br>
The Gnome looked around.  Nope, no one had seen that.  He turned back to steering the ship and tried to forget it had ever happened.<br>
<br>
Antonica - <br>
<br>
Kalaz stepped off the raft, walked down the dock and onto the sandy beach of Northern Ro Desert.  He sighed contentedly.  How many times had he made the trek across this stretch of sand?  To the tunnels of Guk and back, more times than he cared to think about.  Hunting the giants who made their homes out among the dunes.  So many times....  He smiled to himself and headed out acorss the sand towards the tunnel that would lead to the Commonlands.<br>
