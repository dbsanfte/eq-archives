And the air was so fresh, i felt as if i was in heaven.<br>
<br>
My first steps in the Karanas were relaxed and free as throughout the whole journey here i had been in trouble almost all of the time. Though Gwions directions here werent the strongest, past travels here had given me a little help.<br>
<br>
I took the right hill from the Gorge and it was a steady step from there to the river. I could not cross the river for the current was too strong, and beasts harsher than imagination lurked in those waters. So i headed left from the hill and followed the river for a few feets when i saw a "green" beast named Broon bathing in the river.<br>
<br>
Broon was far behond my experience level, so i left him to his buiseness. Taking a detour through the Druid Ring, i noticed a griffon of respectable level in the distance being attacked by three truely great casters. I followed the fight from that Druid Circle to the bridge where they finally slayed the creature. I applouded at them and they said it wasnt a challenge.<br>
<br>
Reviewing Gwions directions i fought with myself if this was the bridge to cross to get to South Karana or if it was farther down. That moment those casters attacked Broon. Broon was no match for those brave few that took him down.<br>
<br>
When i decided that this bridge was correct Broon was no more, and his corpse lay on the path to the bridge. So i traveled acrossed the bridge wondering why i havent seen much action on this side of Antonica. Not that is was a problem.<br>
<br>
Loading, Please Wait...<br>
You have just entered South Karana!<br>
<br>
When i entered this part of the Karana's, i knew nothing of of what to do. And this is where Gwions directions got itchy. But i pushed on knowing i needed to get to Qeynos for i made it half way, and wasnt going to run all the way back.<br>
<br>
I followed the path for 30 feet and cam upon a crossroads, left or right. As i though of which to go 5 creatures i have never heard of before appeared.<br>
<br>
Griffawns, not Griffons, Griffawns. They looked the same, moved the same, and with no dought acted the same. And when 5 of them appeared out of no where, i froze. One flew in front of me. Another to my back, and the third to my side. The next one flew not 20 feet from me and was no harm but the next flew right over me. I knew this was it and that i couldnt do anything. I closed my eyes in expectance to get a swift blow to my head and be gone.<br>
<br>
Then in the distance i heard someone casting. The griffawn went to attack them. It was those casters from North Karana. Just in time too! I thanked them and they said it was no problem. They then waved to me and went their way.<br>
<br>
Now i still had to choose a path. Left, or Right? I then got this "gut" feeling like i had been here before and i knew where to go. I took the right path.<br>
<br>
I traveled that path for about 5 minutes and came to another crossroads. I took the right path again. Then when the trees began to disapear and the path layed lonely on the Plains, I knew i was about to enter the West Karanas.<br>
<br>
When i entered the final Karanas of my journey i thought to myself i finally made it and that this would be a breeze from here on. It was not.<br>
<br>
It got dark, and it got dark fast. I hadnt been to this part of West Karanas. Before i was fortunate to get a Teleport across Norrath. Now as i thought i this would be a breeze i made very bad judgement. I went directions without even thinking. This would get me lost for 2 hours in a place that i had no clue of my whereabouts.<br>
<br>
I wandered aimlessly with no clue where i was going. Looking for something, a sign, a clue, a familiar piece of land that would point me in the right direction. I passed Ogre Shamans, Bandits, Grizzlies, Undead Beings, and even a rumored Werewolf was stalking this very prairie!<br>
<br>
These hours of pointless traveling made my mind hurt since there was not much action or adventure. I passed the occaisonal hazard but not much. And i never got into trouble.<br>
<br>
When i saw a tall building in the foreground, i stopped for a moment. Hoping i had finally made it to a familair part of these lands. I advanced fast, then started running, then knowing where i actually was after wandering for so long.<br>
<br>
Everything seemed to come back together. I was so happy i yelled out that i was finally "home" for 2 straight minutes.<br>
<br>
I followed the path that i actually knew and finally made it to Qeynos Hills. But wait, whats that 4 legged grey thing over there!?<br>
<br>
I went to investigate, it looked as if it would be nice. When i saw what it really was i did nothing but run. That rumored werewolf, it wasnt a rumor. It growled and snarled at me as i ran for my life on full SoW. The swipe it took at me i almost collapse just from the scare. It missed though, twice, and i kept running as SoW ran out.<br>
<br>
The werewolf was much higher than me and probably nearing level 40 or so of experience, just looking for a friend to play with. My SoW gone, and my heart pounding, i made it to the zone. But did i loose him? I looked back in curiosity, just to see.<br>
<br>
He hit me, he hit me hard for 73 points of dmg! And he knocked me into Qeynos Hills!<br>
<br>
When i entered the Hills i nearly fainted. Looking for signs of Werewolf disease, and with a very frightened mind, i thought to myself, IM HOME!<br>
