<br>
My name RL is Ethan Hova and I'm 18 years old (high school senior). I live on Long Island in New York but next year I'll be going away to beautiful sunny (HA!) Pittsburgh where I'll be studying acting at Carnegie Mellon. In case I haven't mentioned it at all in game, acting is my passion and when I'm not on EQ its usually because I'm off at rehearsal or having fun at a cast party.<br>
<br>
In any case, I got the name Cefias when I used to play on MUDs years ago. For me, thinking of a good name is the hardest part of any fantasy game and ever since I thought up this name (I think I thought it up...I might have ripped it off of some guy in a MUD I played on once) I've used it for every game I played. Before coming to EQ, I played Gemstone III for about three years although I'm very glad I made the move. :P<br>
<br>
As for a significant other...my girlfriend of a year and a half broke up about three months ago so I'm very very single as well! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Seriously, EQ to me is a place where I can socialize with extremely nice people (hence RA) and I'd rather sit down and talk with anyone about anything than hack away at giants...although I have a good time doing that too. Send me a tell if I haven't met you! All of you are so wonderful, I'd really love to speak with all of you before I leave for college in August (I may have to give up EQ...but that's another story).<br>

<br>
In RL I am matt price and I live near manchester in the UK,  I am a Maths mature student doing my first degree.  I'm 31, married and my wife is expecting our first child on Friday.  (damn, that sounds close!!!)<br>
<br>
I am also a bit ofa Welsh nationaliset at heart (I do  wonder what I am doing living in england sometimes? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )So that is where Aenorn's surname comes from.  Draggon Fach is th welsh for little dragon.  I don't think I am fierce enough to be a draggon mawr (big draggon) but I hope that I breath a little bit of fire on unkindness in Norrath and else where!  <br>
<br>
Anyway, Aenorn poped out of the generator as it was my first character and I just wanted to play quick.  It is pretty handy in alpha loot situations though! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Hmmm there is a sort of slang in France called &quot;Verlan&quot;, which would be translated by &quot;versere&quot; in english or something like that. (versere = reverse pronounced by reversing the syllabus).<br>
Now Kaymar stands for Markay (reversed pronounciation) which is the nickname of a boy I used to live with (he is Estephe, 51 Vicar on Morell-Thule) and who let me discover the game. Actually I play on his acount (cause I started a character when he was on holidays) and he plays with mine (I didn't want to drop Kaymar so he had to take another account, which I pay).<br>
<br>
Tupiches = again a slang word, but regular slang, not built one, and that means : &quot;Yourturnadrink&quot; or something like that. Cause this is a phrase we used to love when Estephe and I were in engineer school. (yeah, people DO drink a lot in engineers schools <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
and Estephe is the name of a good french wine. He has no surname cause when he will be a 60 high-priest, having just a &quot;Estephe &lt;The Forgotten&gt;&quot; above his head will be just too cool.<br>
<br>
And as you may have guessed, I live in Paris, France, just like Estephe, Tandainu, Okhom and Westergaard.<br>
I am 25 (26 in august) and am an associate of a consulting company. <p><BR>

<br>
I am known as Michael R. Wane in RL, I am a 34 year old male, living in a constant state of Misery ... oops, slight typo, make that Missouri. hehe<br>
<br>
Buvarin got his name, by playing with the name generator, when the game constantly refused the name i wanted.  I finally settled on Buvarin, as it sounded more like a conglomeration of human, and elven societies.  His last name was chosen at conception, and refers to the glow given off from his primary weapon.  I suppose one of these days I will post his history, heritage, and his Oath Ceremony ... but that is for another time.<br>
<br>
Meunlyte, my bard, got his name when the server rejected Moonlight ... so I monkey'd the spelling until I got the one he uses ... and I have used that name for the 3 bards I have made attempts at running ... his last name will be Serenade ... or a monkey'd version there of.<br>
<br>
Well, there ya have it, a little about me, and even less about my characters ... oh well, to early for jokes ... where is my Mt. Dew? ...

This has been so much fun reading about everyone. Great idea especially for our 1st Anniversary.<br>
<br>
I'm Donna Satterfield thus the DSatt and I was born August 14, 1957 thus the 57. I live in western South Carolina between Charlotte, NC and Atlanta, GA. I love my area, it is beautiful here.<br>
I am single with no kids and work as an Admin. Assistant for now but am hoping to go back to school and get my BS in Accounting. We'll see how the money goes. Until last year, I worked in our family's commercial woodworking business as the Office Manager. I love music (used to play guiter, still have a 12 string), movies especially Star Wars, astronomy and the space program, and computers (hard to believe that I was scared to death of Windows 3.1 about 6 years ago, lol, now I'm on them all the time!!)<br>
<br>
Alluramar's name came from thinking of an enchantress of the sea... perhaps a Siren but one who would do good. I originally planned to be a Paladin because I liked the description but I liked the stats of the warrior and since I knew little of the game I figured I'd keep it simple and just slice and dice. I picked a half elf because I thought they were pretty... ok, so I'm vain. :-)<br>
Sabinne's name came from the book Griffin and Sabine which I listened to on tape and was very intriguing.<br>
So that's pretty much all about me an my ladies<br>

As to why the name Fayth? well if you happen to be a Druid, you gotta have faith right? (LOL) ok now for the surname...Enbeegora, well the druids kinda hung out in the irish and scottish areas, and i've heard them say &quot; Faith and Begora!!&quot; so it kinda fit. I love playing a druid because i can heal and sow and TP(soon), and i can fight if i have to with a weapon.<br>

 In RL my name is Dawn Howell, i am the mother of 5 children ages 11-19, i will be 36 on August 25th, I live in Michigan where the weather will always suprise me, i am a laser printer operator for Lason inc., i am happily married and my hubby also plays EQ as a 29th season Pally, Glaorn. We have played on ultima but we have found everquest to much more...3-D??<br>

I got my name Humae from, if you havent gotten it already Huma of the Dragonlance series.

After I got through school, I skipped going to college,(lack of funds) and joined the US Navy...bad choice I thought, but turned out to be a good one.  On june 16th, 1996 I was stationed in Atusgi Japan, about 20miles south of Tokyo.  People, if you ever have the cash to visit a new country, visit Japan.  The people there are the nicest people you will ever find <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Imagine a country full or RA people, and that is Japan.

It was funny the first time I meet her family, being that they didnt speak any english, poor Kaori had to translate the whole night <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...now my Japanese is much better, and I can talk with them now (my wife speaks pretty damn good english, better than mine).  Another person I meet was Dolumar (Whorl)  hehe I have many stories with him, but I am sad because I meet him so late in the end of my tour, we only got to hang out a few times.  Well he got me into EQ, and we lived in barracks, and well, I would play on his computer when he would sleep, maybe for 12hours, then he would wake up and play for 12hours, pretty funny...but god did that room stink!<br>
But anyways, now I am stationed in sunny San Diego, CA, my wife is having a hard time adjusting to living in America, but things are getting much better everyday. She has a waitress job, and comes home and wakes me up to complain about the american people everyday...sigh, I never get any sleep hehe.<br>
My job in the navy is .,.....umm well, I am an aircraft parts expediter....meaning I sit on the internet all night hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Miriel is my first and only character in EQ and I've only been playing since May this year. The name is stolen from a family tree in one of Tolkien's books and to my surprise it wasn't taken.

And for you who also are from Sweden, NO I'm not a skåning, I actually grew up in Halmstad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I entered this world on July 14 in 1976, which will make me 25 in exactly four days. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'm a student at Lund Institute of Technology and I'm studying to become a Fire Safety Engineer. That means that I one day may have *my own* fire station and bossing the fire fighters around or I will become a consultant and make a lot of money. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
So there you have the basics of who I am, if you want to know more I guess you just have to talk to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I love chatting time away.

As for Crohan, the name is a small modification of my SCA clan name (im known as Lachlan mac Creoimthain).<br>
And it is originally an old surname from ireland <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Joyfull spawned from the fact that at the beginning i was allways saying hih, heh, yup.... and so on <br>
So when it came time to choose a surname i tried &quot;Hih'Alot&quot; and was imideatly downballed by a GM saying no we cant have a HIT ALOT.<br>
Well in the end i choose Joyfull as it ment almost the same, heh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I work as worktime supervisor and bonus system upkeeper.<br>
Hmmm, that sounded bad, but i cant explain my job anyway else.<br>
I am active in 2 medieval societys, still play tabletop (since 83, lol), LARP from now and then, and spent the rest with EQ or friends, or both.<br>
<br>
I founded EQ about 6 months ago, and have spread it to 8 RL friends so far. I guess EQ is addictive, i was hooked just by seeing my bro playing it once, lol <br>

Sorry about taking so long to do this, I didn't realize what this post was for, and then forgot about it for a long time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my RL name is Michael Thomas.  Yes, a guy plays girly Donnalinna.  And I'm an impressive 25 years old (woo-hoo, lower car-insurance city!)  I was born on August 21, 1976, in dusty San Antonio, TX.  I now live in Cleveland, Ohio working for Engelhard as a Chemical Engineer.  I actually have a BA in Biochemistry from CWRU.<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.three-musketeers.net/mike/">www.three-musketeers.net/mike/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
As for how the name &quot;Donnalinna Swansbeauty&quot; came about, well here is the short of it.  I always have liked long, girly names.  Patricia, Elizabeth, that sort of thing.   Oh, for you wacky Europeans, it has a &quot;Z&quot; not an &quot;S&quot;.  E-liZ-a-beth.  Not E-liS-a-beth.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, I wanted to play a female character, and actually try to make her a girl.  So... the most &quot;feminine&quot; of the races out there, to me, were the High Elves.  They had the long hair, the dress, that sort of thing.  But, I had always read stories where elves have long, hard-to-pronounce, multi-syllabled names.  So, I didn't think Donna would fit.<br>
<br>
Now, add in that I was just reading about merchant-prince Italy, and I wanted my name to sound kinda Italian.  So, Donna expanded to Donnalinna.  As for Swansbeauty, I've always thought of birds as magical and dreamy.  And Swans are traditionally considered pretty, and graceful.  So, I wanted Donnalinna to have a name that was synonomous with &quot;grace&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot;, even if she sometimes wasn't.<br>
<br>
So, that's how the name &quot;Donnalinna Swansbeauty&quot; came about.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;Ptalaphose&quot;, the short of it is, I thought the Erudians looked really Egyptian. In specific, Ptolemaic Egyptian.  So, I wanted a Ptolemaic-esq name, and I've always thought the whole &quot;Silent T&quot; thingy was neat.   So... BOOM, Ptalaphose.  If I ever get Ptala up to lvl 20, his last name is going to be Freelancer.<br>

Been here for 5 years,  Been Playing EQ for about 11 months now.  My first ever char was Kyee,(name from a Battleteck book I liked) Kai but it wouldnt take, Next was Kiee his twin brother cause Kyee met with a horrible death in the warrens,  Well Kiee met his faith there as well trying to avenge his brother.  Then came Thoarne,  Thoarne  Tygerheart (that is cause I love tigers and it sounded neat) was a my DE warrior I took to 30 and then got my own account and lost all that time (I was a bit bitter on this one) Thoarne came from just my idea and playing a DE,  That is where I got in to my first real guild, Reapers of Sorrow.  Well Thoarne and the leader had some issues, DIfferent views of what we should do as a guild.  So he left and Joined RA.  Parin well was a whim.  wanted a druid and for some reason Parin came to my mind have no clue how.  As many of yall know my surname is apples,  That was my roommates fault,  was going with Blackthoarne (a game and also a favorite Merc unit in Battletech as well).  I had Thoarn my warrior again but started my druid playing more and fell in love with him cause I love to explore and travel.  This is for anyone that ever asked me where level DONT, I have one of the most screwed up lvling ideas in the world. ok that is all for my char.<br>
<br>
BTW my name is Jason,  My friends call me Tex, I am originally from Texas and it shows =).  And I am 22 soon to be 23 in January.  <br>

<br>
My main character was a 24 dwarven pally but i lost the faith you could say and started playing a high elf wiz named Kelios she is now in her 50th lvl, she doesn't have a last name yet, not sure why i haven't chose one, don't have any meaning, i just like it when i typed it in.... My other characters are a 24th gnome rouge Gerri Attrix... you can see where i got that name from (it means a really old person)... i started a bard WE named Kelias....I just wanted a sister for Kelios...<br>

I'm Kakkamar Goblingutter (Should the name take when I reach 20). The name was just in my head, I saw a lot of Ks, and thought I'd cram as many as I could into one name. Goblingutter is fairly easy to explain. Early on in my career playing EQ, about a year and a half ago, I got whacked by a goblin wizard at level 4. Well, from that point on I began to despise goblins, so I came up with a surname that'd fit my mentality toward them, thus Goblingutter- Disemboweler of goblins.<br>
<br>
Most of you know me as Stumpypudge Stubbyfingers. This name's easy enough to pronounce, if not type. I just saw a gnome when I was bored of my druid long ago, and he was stumpy and pudgy, so it was a given. And they have the stubbiest fingers, too...so that was a snap (pardon the unintentional pun).<br>
<br>
In RL, I'm Bryan McGuire, age 26. I'm married to my lovely wife (yes she's sitting right here), Kerry, and we have a daughter Caty (Short for Caitlain) who's 3 years old. I live in the armpit of the Appalachain mountains in Boone, North Carolina. I work at the local university, Appalachian State University, as does Kerry. Oh, and if you're ever in the area, let me know. I'd love to meet some of you!<br>
