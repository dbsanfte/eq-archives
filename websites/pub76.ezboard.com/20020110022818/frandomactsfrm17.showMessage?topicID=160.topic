Once we get it done, I'll post that set of detailed instructions here.  Keep in mind, though, that it will be one of many possible ways to do it.<br>
<br>
And while you're waiting, a short primer on what DirectX is, and the different pieces of software you are using and don't even know it.  <br>
<br>
DirectX (commonly referred to as DX) is the Microsoft (commonly referred to as Those Bastards, $*%))##&amp;, or simply ARRGGGHHH!) technology that lets an application, typically games, interact directly with the hardware on your video card.  Normally an application has to interface with Windows, which then manages the communications with the hardware device.  DirectX bypasses, or shortcuts, this Windows management.  Until DirectX came along, we had to be in DOS to run any graphic-intensive games, removing the Windows management layer by removing Windows.  Of course, that also removed our ability to access over a terrabtye (a thousand gigabytes) of memory and all the other wonderful things that Windows provides.<br>
<br>
In order to make it all work for EQ, we use several things:  <br>
The Client is your actual Everquest application running on your PC.  <br>
The Server is, of course, VI's server in CA, Europe, or wherever.<br>
The Engine is in 2 parts: there is an EQ specific .dll (Dynamic-Linked Library), and DirectX itself (also in .dll's), which contain all the code instructions needed for the Client to communicate with your video hardware.<br>
The Configuration file is eqclient.ini and is nothing more then a text file containing configuration settings for your EQ Client.<br>
<br>
Up until now, your Engine, your Client, and the Server have all used DX7.  Now, as we all know, we are going to DX8.  It's really not as bad as it seems.  The majority of you will make the conversion with minimal effort.  Some of us will have trouble, but it's mostly folks with older machines or goofy hardware.  I, luckily, have an older machine WITH goofy hardware. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
So, the basic process we need to follow to get up to speed is:<br>
1. Download all the driver software you'll need.<br>
2. Remove your existing video drivers.  This will allow DirectX to interface directly with Windows and your hardware during the upgrade process.<br>
3. Upgrade to DirectX 8.<br>
4. Reinstall your video and audio drivers with the latest revisions.<br>
5. You already have the new EQ .dll, they patched it in sometime in the last couple days.<br>
6. Change your Configuration file to tell your Client to use the DX8 Engine.<br>
7. Log in to the test Server, wich is also utilizes DX8, to make sure everything is working.<br>
8. Change your Configuration file back to DX7, because normal EQ is still on 7.<br>
9. /cheer  /dance  /rude VI<br>
<br>
Here's some of the things that might be confusing people:<br>
Just because you have DX8 installed on your PC doesn't mean you are using the full DX8 engine.  DX8 is backward compatible with DX7, so your EQ Client and Server and EQ .dll's can all be communicating with your hardware via the DX8 on your PC, they are just using DX7 instructions. In order to test the DX8, you have to tell your Client to USE the DX8 instruction set, and log in to the test Server, which is also using DX8 instructions.<br>
<br>
Again, this is ONE way to accomplish it.  I'm sure there are many other ways.  Please continue to post questions/concerns on the other thread, and I'll continue to collate the information in this thread.  We have plenty of geeks in the guild, so we're not gonna lose anyone if we can help it.  See ya on the moon!<br>

<br>
1. Create a directory on your C drive called &quot;Drivers&quot;.<br>
2. Under the &quot;Drivers&quot; directory create directories called &quot;Video&quot;, &quot;Audio&quot;, and &quot;DirectX&quot;.<br>
3. Now we'll download into those directories and you'll know precisely where everything is.<br>
4. Copy and paste this address into your browser: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://ftp://205.158.109.140/Windows/21.83/Win9x_21.83.exe">ftp://205.158.109.140/Windows/21.83/Win9x_21.83.exe</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  This is the latest NVidia drivers for Win95/98/ME.<br>

They made a DX 8.1 for Win 98.  The DX 8.1 I saw on the site said for NT/2000/XP only.  Sounds like they either saw that it would work for the other Windows or they fixed the thing that was keeping it working. <br>
<br>
Just as a side note, If you are Running Win XP DO NOT UPGRADE your DX.  XP comes standard with 8.1 and you might over write your exsisting DX.  If you have done this and it works .. great, but if you haven't don't risk the always dubious Download unless you have to. <br>
