She had worked hard this day and had a few plat in her pocket from her endeavors and a room to return to above.  This waitressing job she had agreed to assist with wasn't too hard and it allowed her time to relax compared to her normal duties.  <br>
<br>
She pulled a chair closer to the hearth and sat down to watch the late stragglers in the common room sit about and chat.  She felt safe here but she knew this was only temporary soon she would need to move on.  <br>
<br>
She looked around and saw many peoples she knew still carring on quiet conversations Radgen, Hornet, Harte, and others.  She still wondered what had happen with Sasi and wondered if she would ever meet her.  <br>
<br>
Why was she so cold?  She was sitting right up against the fire, she couldn't understand why she couldn't get warm...</i><br>
<br>
"AH AH AH CHOO" <br>
<br>
Looking around at her humble camp and her comrades that were traveling with her she realized that being back at the Note had been a wonderous dream and she did miss the good times there, even though she had been there less then a month and several seasons ago.  Had she only been a cleric of her 30th year when she spent That magical month their?  Now she was a Vicer of Rodcet Nife and she felt the strain of her duties more so everyday.<br>
<br>
She had to get to the Karana's, there was talk that Bertoxxulous was showing his presence their and as her gods one sworn enemy she felt her present would be needed their in the future, but how soon and would she have time to help her current friend infiltrate deeper into this new world of Velious.  She would just trust that Rodcet Nife would lead her where she needed to be and when.<br>
<br>
She wondered if her persuers still hunted her and if she still had a price on her head?  What kinda of father would place a bounty on his own daughters head?  She hadn't heard anything since she fled the Note that last night and she had aged and gained some valuable experience since then.  When she looked in mirrors she no longer recognized herself, there was a look in her eyes of one who had seen too much death and suffering, would it ever end?<br>
<br>
"Do not come any closer to us stranger.  Who are you and what do you want?" A male voice boomed from her left and looking over she recognized the young palladin who had been assigned the morning watch.  Others around her quickly began to pull their swords and shields out and looking at the various casters with her she could tell they were already trying to decide what spells would be appropriate.<br>
<br>
"Please I come to your camp because I thought I saw a cleric with you and I have a friend who was slain early last night.  His time grows short for a chance at life once more and I will humbly offer anything I can for assistance from a cleric."  the stranger struggles out, tears rolling down his face.<br>
<br>
Speaking up Lodach looks wearily towards the stranger, "Bring the body here, to me, now and I will do what I can."<br>
<br>
The young, wood elf struggles to pull his friends corpse before her.  The body seems to be that of an Iksar Monk. What strange friendships are formed in these troubled times she reminds herself, back in her childhood in Qeynos she could never image traveling with other races of Norrath but she had learned that friendship was not based on the race of one but on the heart of one, as her group of travelers would attest to.<br>
<br>
Standing up she looks at the wood elf and then back down on the body of his friend and begins. "I call upon the power of Rodcet Nife to give this soul life once more, let all who witness this miricle give thanks to the prime healer."<br>
<br>
The body stirs and the eyes open and the young wood elf kneels besides his friend.  Lodach watch still amazed that she has been blessed by her god to be able to grant this blessing on others.<br>
<br>
"What do I owe you?" the wood elf ask.<br>
<br>
Looking at the wood elf she replies, "A random act of kindness committed by yourself and your friend, upon a stranger, perhaps if everyone commits one act of kindness in Norrath we can change the world.  Keep your money it is not what I seek."<br>
<br>
"Lets break camp friend we must prepare to sneak into Kael and speak with our contact."  She hears the strong voice of the one of her protectors behind her announce to the group and she turns and begins preparing her own gear for travel. <p>Lodach Trueheart, cleric of her 53rd season<BR>

So dark and musty and having to sneak in always put her in a bad mood.  It was perfectly positioned in Velious to prevent easy travel between the Dragons and the Dwarves, Stupid giants, how they had ever managed to gain this advantage was beyond her.<br>
<br>
Her team had killed a wandering guard that had come upon them and for now they were saftly awaiting the return of their comrade who had gone to speak to their contact....Wenglawks.  Her comrade was a ranger so she preyed his invisible held out long enought to get whatever, Wenglawks felt was so dire for the alliance to know.  She was monitoring the rangers health magically from the distance but she still worried if anything went wrong she would be too far away to do anything about it.  She hated waiting as a friend risked their life out of her reach.<br>
<br>
"He gave me a letter and I paid for his services again, lets get the hell out of here before someone comes to check on this guard," the ranger said as he dropped his cammo before them and pointed to the body of the dead giant.<br>
<br>
She smiled at him as a feeling of relief flooded over her and then she felt the shimmer of the magic around her as the druid with them ported them away to safty, in the blink of an eye, she looked around and noticed that they were at the Cobalt Scar dragon ring.<br>
<br>
"Well at least we are in friendly territory, lets head down to the beach and gets some oysters for supper from the Othmir, while we decode the message from Wenglawks."  with that and a sigh of relief at pulling off yet another tricky contact, the team began the trek down the rocky cliffs to the Othmir village.<br>

Her boots were beside her and she was enjoying the feel of the sand between her toes as she slowly dug them in and out of the sand, even though this wasn't a really warm beach to be barefoot on it still felt good to let her feet breath.<br>
<br>
"You look like a school girl who is getting away with something devious, what are you thinking?" one of her male comrades speaks up from behind her.<br>
<br>
"I didn't know you were watching me darling, I am just happy to be safe right now and not worried about ambushes or other dangers.  I have the companionship of 5 great friends and the protection I always desired when I was younger."  Lodach moves over to her male companion and curls up against him, "Hold me, while we wait for the decoding to be done."<br>
<br>
"Guys we got it, but so many more unanswered questions to find out now." <br>
<br>
"What do you mean dear?"<br>
<br>
"The message here take a look, I am not even sure that Wenglawks knows what is in it.  It was definitely not meant for our eyes, thank god he made a copy for us."<br>
<br>
Opening the parchment with the decoded message, Lodach begins to read:<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<i>Greeting and Salutations, my friend.  <br>
<br>
Your clever and your military mind has impressed me.  After looking over your plans to extinguish those that are thorns in both our peoples sides, I agree to pledge my troops to this endeavor, on one condition, that after this is done Velious is mine to rule alone.  <br>
<br>
We must cripple their movements, for they will fight back once we make our move. We must attack them where they are weakest and where support will be slow coming.  <br>
<br>
I have already assigned one of my Generals to prepare a special force to gain control of the dragon rings throughout Velious.  Once under our control, any party who ports in will be our allies or extinguished with little hesitation.  My forces will keep our enemies from ease of movement in Velious,  I suggest you do the same throughout Antonica.  <br>
<br>
Set up forces at all porting destinations and kill any who are not recognized as friends, we will then gather the main force to assist with the coming of our gods.<br>
<br>
If all goes well, movement throughout Velious will be crippled in one weeks time as I systematically take control of the dragon rings, Waking land, Great Divide, Ice clad will be the easy ones.  I will find away to take over the one in Cobalt Scar as soon as possible but the dragons will protect that one vehenamontly at first.<br>
<br>
Sincerly<br>
<br>
Tormax</i><br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Tears streamed down her face as the full extent of what she was reading hit her.  There was going to be a war that spanned at least two continents.  But the letter still didn't tell them who was Alling with the giants on Antonicia.  The Dark Elves maybe?  Or someone even more devious?   <p>Lodach Trueheart, cleric of her 53rd season<BR>

Silently, laying hidden by spell and white cougar skins that blend in with the snow, the diminuitive wood elf counted ...<br>
<br>
A frosty puff of warm breath wafts out to slightly melt the snow, which instantly refreezes only to repeat the cycle with her next breath.  As the count rises and finally concludes, the breath catches and stops in amazement.<br>
<br>
At least 2 score of the battle hardened elite orcs stood arrayed in formation before the gate, flanked to the left by by 8 Krom Giant Soldiers, also battle hardened, presenting a nearly impossible front of forces to protect what is inside.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;This is going to be a trick.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she thought, eyeing each orc, trying to see which ones were least attentive and most likely to not hear the camoflagued elf sneak by.  One misstep, one wayward sound or just plain unluck would have the pack upon her in short order.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;And we know how that will end, don't we Mye?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, was her next wry thought. <br>
 <br>
She immediately silently chastised herself for thinking to herself. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Been out in the cold to much have you?  Wouldn't you love to be back in the Missed Note next to the fireplace, listening to Sasi play her wonderful music ... eating Vandaal's scrumptious cooking ... trading stories with friends ... &quot;.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The sound of large feet as the next Giant shift arrives shakes Myethia out of daydreams, bringing the cold crashing back in.  Silently and slowly, she scoots back over the ridge til she can get up and lope away with fleeting elvish grace.<br>
<br>
There is still a job to do, spells to refresh, a quick bite of cold jerky, before the attempt to enter must be made.  <br>
<br>
Her employer wanted the message delivered to the dwarves deep within the Crystal Caverns, no matter what ...<br>

However long it was she needed a break and she pushed the oversized chair away from the desk that sat on one end of her room, and stood to stretch out.<br>
<br>
She looked around the room once more and relized how thankful she was to the hospitality of Lord Yelnik here in Skyshrine.  The room was musty but there was a bed, a desk and a small hearth to help take the chill out of the room.  Her commrades had simmilar quarters on this floor also.  The druids and wizzies that were with here had already taken one batch of the scrolls she worked on to major cities and encampments who would need to know of the upcoming plans of the giants.  Hopefully it wasn't too late to form a defense and stop them before they made a move.<br>
<br>
Grrrrr Rumble grrrr......Startled that her stomach realized she was hungry before here mind registered she decided to walk down to the kitchen and see about getting something to eat off the the cook.  She wondered if he had somemore of that Plum spiced Walrus still hot.  Her mouth watered.<br>
<br>
She looked once more at the scrolls that she had finished with her seal as a Vicar of Rodcet Nife pressed into the wax of the 8 more finished scrolls she had finished, with a shrug she turned and walked out of the room heading for the kitchen and the promise of a quieter belly. <p>Lodach Trueheart, cleric of her 53rd season<BR>

Lodach looked at her comrade and let out a long sigh.  Would Norrath pull together to fight?  Or would the giants and their ally take over without a fight.  Hers was a small party what could they do?  Gorilla warfare perhaps.<br>
<br>
"Gather the team, make sure everyone gets a good nights sleep it may be our last for awhile.

Sure booted feet nimbly dodged half hidden holes, the boot's owner having learned long ago to spot nature's ankle twisting traps under its blanket of snow.<br>
<br>
   Half a day gone before the path decends into high walled valley, at the end of which is a gate and guardhouse taller than the tallest Giant, marking the entrance to Kael.  The slim figure slows, an involuntary shutter racking it's body as unwelcome memories of previous times within surface ...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   ... the prayer to Tunare was just as fervant as it was silent, a plea for the Goddess to keep the wood elf's Camo spell up for only a short bit longer.  If it were to drop now while she slunk through the middle of the most populated part of the Giant City ... she shudders and quickly puts that out of mind, concentrating upon her task of just making it through to the other side, where the rest of the Lemmings waited.<br>
  It was not fated to be so, or else Tunare was in a fickle mood.  She could feel the spell start to fade, and in a desperate move, she started running with all the speed she could muster, casting stealth aside in an attempt to reach the the woods beyond the far gate.  Misfortune continued as a Giant Guard spotted the fleeting form to immediately give chase, calling out to other nearby giants who gleefully took up the chase.<br>
   And a short chase it was.  The wood elf never looked back, never saw the big sword that blew through chain armor like butter to crush the life out of her ...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   The furred spell cloaked form's mind refused to think of it anymore, rejecting still remembered pain to come back to the present.  Taking a deep breath, checking if the camo spell was still strong, she hurries quietly through the gate and its guards, entering Kael proper to retrace her earlier disasterous steps.<br>
