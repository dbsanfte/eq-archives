They said she attacked another shopper for exceeding the limit in the fast checkout line. <br><br> <br>   Watch Gail Huff's Report   <br> <br> <br>NewsCenter 5's Gail Huff reported that the alleged attack happened Sunday, Feb. 10 and the suspect was arrested. She was released and told to come to court the next day but she never showed up. <br><br>Police identified the suspect as Karen Morgan, 39, of Lowell. The 51-year-old female victim, who is afraid of being identified, said the altercation began when both were food shopping at a Market Basket supermarket. The victim had 13 items in the 12-item or less checkout line. <br><br> <br>&quot;There was a woman behind me and she said, 'Oh, some people don't know how to count.' And I said, I just questioned her, and I said, 'Oh, do you have a problem with me?' And she said yes, and started swearing and cussing me out,&quot; the victim said. <br><br>She said the suspect then followed her as she walked home. <br><br>&quot;I said, 'Really, could you just leave me alone?' And then she just brutally attacked me. She grabbed me by my hair, pulled me to the ground, kneed me in my stomach, and I was on the ground and she kicked me on my head and on my side and I got all scratched up. She drew blood,&quot; the victim said. <br><br>But she remembered the suspect's license plate number. Police traced the car to Morgan's house. <br><br>&quot;Sunday morning, no one expects anything to happen to them, especially going to the grocery store to pick up some groceries. To have some kind of road rage mentality inside a supermarket is unheard of. I've never had an incident like this happen,&quot; Lowell Police Lt. Robert Demourua said. <br><br>Police said Morgan had missed court appearances before. She has previous defaults for larceny of checks.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <p><br><br><br><br><center><font face="lucida handwriting" size=5 font color="FF0000">Sasi</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffda><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ufilanfyretracker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filan Fyretracker</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/02 1:17:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=568.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It annoys me too but.......</span><hr size=1> just using the region of the report i think i work for the company whos store this probally happened outside of. <p><center><a href="mailto:filan@snet.net"><img SRC="http://pages.cthome.net/filanwizard/filansig3.jpg" height=172 width=444 border="0"></a><br><i>This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System.

This is &quot;rude rage&quot;.  Should that woman have attacked her?  Of course not.  But if that woman had more items than was allowed, why did she go in the quick check line?  People are so incredibly selfish and rude these days, especially anyplace where there are a lot of people.  <br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to justify the attack, but I would like to point out the actions of the victim here.  She was wrong!  She had more items than were allowed, and when confronted by it, was she willing to accept responsibility?  I would wager good odds that had she said &quot;oh, you're right, I have 13 items instead of 12.  I'm sorry&quot; the attacker would have let it drop.  But instead she responded &quot;You got a problem with me?&quot;<br><br>I got in a fight a couple months ago, outside of a movie theater.  Here's what happened:<br><br>I ride a motorcycle.  That day, I had the great pleasure to get a great spot right in front.  There are no special &quot;motorcycle spots&quot; at this particular center, so I took a spot for a full size car.  When my wife and I came out of the theater, someone had double parked behind my bike, making it impossible for me to get out (it's a big bike).  I said to my wife &quot;it's probably someone who just ran in somewhere for a minute, they'll probably be right out&quot;.  So we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  After about 15 minutes, I said &quot;well, I'll go and find security, see if they can make an announcement and get the car moved, or barring that, have it towed away (double parking is, after all, illegal).<br><br>Leaving my wife to wait by the bike, I ran back inside the movie theater to ask about security.  They said that there was nothing they could do about it, so I asked them if I could use their phone to call the police (have to have it ticketed before you can have it towed).  As I'm dialing the phone, I look out to the parking lot and see a guy running out towards the car.  I figure that's the guy, so I hang up the phone and start walking out towards the parking lot again.<br><br>As I walk up, I say to the guy (my exact words) &quot;Y'know man, we've been waiting out here for almost a half hour.  Couldn't you have found someplace else to park?&quot;<br><br>At this point, if he had said &quot;Man, I'm really sorry, I thought I was only going to be a minute but time got away from me&quot; I would have said &quot;no worries&quot; and that would have been the end of it.  I'm very easygoing, it was a nice day, there was a park nearby, and we had nothing else to do, so it really wasn't that big of a deal.<br><br>His reponse?  &quot;F*ck you buddy, why don't you park your bike somewhere else?&quot;<br><br>Well, I'll spare you the details, since RL fights aren't really that cool, but basically, if that guy had an ounce of civility and respect for his common man, he wouldn't have gotten punched in the face.<br><br>Fortunately for me, there were several witnesses around who dissuaded this guy from calling the police (he had taken the first swing), but if he had, I can imagine that the paper the next day would have carried a headline that read something like &quot;Disgrunteld Biker Punches Man in Parking Lot Fracas&quot;, and it would have been a story much like the one you just read, where a minor problem (double parking) ended up with physical assault.  Instead of simply accepting responsibility for his actions, this a-hole instead chose to escalate a minor confrontation into a brawl, which is exactly the same thing that happened with the lady at the check out counter.<br><br>The moral?  Stop being a B*TCH and people won't beat you up.  Most people learned that lesson in third grade.<br><br>p.s.  I really am a nice guy, that was the first fight I had been in in almost 20 years. <p><p><table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>    <td width="33%"></td>    <td width="33%">      <p align="center"><b><font color="#3366CC"><u><span style="text-decoration: overline"><big><big>Vandaal</big></big></span></u><big><big><br>      </big></big></font><font color="#660033">Devilishly Handsome Ranger<br>      </font><font color="#336633"><small><small>Ranger of Norrath</small></small></font></b></td>    <td width="34%"></td>  </tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffda><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/usasisolitaire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sasi Solitaire</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/nwnote.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#000000 size=3><center>The<br>Directionally<br>Challenged<br>Bard</center></font></span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 7:04:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=568.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It annoys me too but.......</span><hr size=1> It's more than likely that the man parked there and in that way on purpose because it pissed him off that you were in the parking spot.   I had someone do that to me.   When the car finally had to be pushed out of the way so I could get out, the owner called the police and said we had damaged his car.  (We had not!)<br><br>I agree that rudeness seems to be spreading.   I have a real big problem with folks who pass by several signs saying &quot;lane ends - merge right&quot; and dozens of cars waiting in line like they are supposed to.... goes right down to the end of the lane and then expects someone to wait and let them in line!   It gets me so upset that I have pulled my little old van into the other lane and just sat there.... blocking the lane but not moving except to keep pace with the space where I had been in line (I saw a truck doing this once and thought it was a wonderful idea!).   I've done this several times (My husband is sure I'm going to get shot someday) and, in Texas, there were several cars who pulled into the median and passed me in order to keep going!  It makes me furious!! <p><br><br><br><br><center><img src=http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/Sasi2.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uvandaal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vandaal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bachelor de jour</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/16/02 2:33:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=568.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It annoys me too but.......</span><hr size=1> Oh, I'm sure that's why he did it.  Some people have a serious chip on their shoulder when it comes to bikers.  In California, it's legal to &quot;split lanes&quot; where you drive between the cars on the lanes, so long as you don't go more than 5 MPH over the speed limit.  I can't tell you how many times I've had people swerve in front of me just because they didn't want me splitting!  <br><br>Note to my friends:  Don't ever do that!  Not only do you risk killing me, but you also risk me putting a huge dent in your car door with my steel toed boot as I squeeze past!<br><br>p.s.
