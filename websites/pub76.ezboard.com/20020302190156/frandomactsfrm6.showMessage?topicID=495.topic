I would ask people if i could join their guild only to be turned down becuase of my level, a typical message would be as follows- <br>    Me: Hi Can I join your guild please?<br>     Them: LOL<br>    Me:Whats so funny?<br>    Them: We only let people over level 50 in<br>    Me: Why?<br>     then that was the end of the message. This happend about 5 times to me and the results were basicly the same each time.  Then one day when i was beating on some fire beatles in the tox i was hailed by someone clad in darkish drapes. He asked me if he could inpect me, this was very weird to me then becuase i had not seen many others but the guards so this guy was kind of a shock to me. I of course said &quot;yes&quot; and he proceded to look at my stuff. Quite proud of my full scale cloth clothing that i had worked so hard for i said, &quot; nice stuff isent it?&quot; i am shure he was laughing to himself but he said nothing to me (for the better as i would have prob been discoureged) and to my delight he proceded to give me 2 polished bone bracers.  all i could do was thank him and he walked off. The only thing i can remember about him was the flasing Name of Random Acts in the Dark Haze of Tox forest.<br>          Today i am lvl 32 and i still have thoes bracers. Remembering how much joy a present so small brought to me i have many times returned to the tox to guide other Erudites like myself though the fine points of the lower levels. Somthing i allwase do is buy each one of them a full suit of cloth armer as i belive that one should not have somthing above his level unless he or she has earned it on their own.  I have had as many as 7 little wizards and enchanters all waiting in line to receve a BP filled with little joys that may help them though their lower levels.  <br>             Another Ritual that i have is to make bad deals with the struggleing of EC. Many of them venture off to EC in hopes that their 15pp can buy them somthing wonderous. i have traded so many things for so little (like 2 plat jasper rings for their 2int ones etc) then i procede to FP were even the lower lvls are and i go to the nearest one and inpect them. If they look like they could use a helping hand i select a little goodie from one of my bags and present it to them in return for a minor quest (just make up somthing like i will give you this 2wis range item if you bring me 6 bat wings and 2 ruined pelts) this often makes them happy and in doing this &quot;quest&quot; i give them and they earn exp points when doing it! <br>         This Guild sounds perfect for me. It would be so nice to seeing the voices of others who enjoy helping another out in the chat window.  I feel lonely in my current guild as no one is ever on and if they are they dont talk at all! i year for more then a guild that has 3 members and of thoes 3 only 1 ever plays EQ anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>          Merlind Magix 32nd Wizard of Morell Thull<br><br>please excuse all spelling errors and stuff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>my email is a8ballz@hotmail.com <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/umorgania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morgania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 369<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 10:33:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=495.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Wanting to Join!</span><hr size=1> Hi there, Merlind<br><br>Thank you for applying for membership of our guild and may I take this opportunity to wish you success in your application. <br><br>We have an application procedure that you will be required to complete in order to enter into full membership of the guild. I have listed the steps below.<br><br>1. Apply in this forum (check!)<br><br>2. Read the Call and Charter. <br>The Call and Charter detail the principles that our Guild are based upon and to proceed you should be in broad agreement with them. You can find details of them at www.eqrandomacts.com. Also reading our Mission Statement and Ethical Guidelines to see what we are all about is important as learning as much about who we are and what we are about will help you make an informed decision about joining us.<br><br>3. Attend Random Acts Events<br>There are three main reasons for this, it is fun, you get to meet lots of guild members and most importantly you will need to seek out a sponsor. Details of upcoming events can be found on this message board under Events, Hunting and Gathering.<br><br>4. Find a Sponsor <br>A sponsor is a regular guild member that will mentor you through the fledgling quest/community service and support you in your application. It is also hoped that you will form a special relationship with your sponsor. Your sponsor will also be responsible for you. You can find who is on at any one time by typing the command &lt;/who all random&gt; <br>(Note: Guild members can sponsor more than one fledgling.)<br><br>5. Perform Fledgling Quest or Community Service quest<br>Details of the quest can be found at www.eqrandomacts.com and you can perform either one with the assistance and advice of your sponsor.<br><br>6. Guild Tagging <br>Upon successful completion of your Quest, your sponsor must notify Meriel Silvertree or Gwion Llwellyn either by posting here on the board, or through a tell in game, you will then receive your Random Acts Tag at the next scheduled First Aid Camp (FA).<br>First Aid Camps are generally held every two weeks, the first one on a Saturday, and the next one on a Sunday.<br><br>7. Probationary Membership<br>Probationary Membership will last until you attend the *next* regularly scheduled FA and barring any difficulties you will be accepted into the guild as a full member.<br><br>8. Alternate Characters<br>You will be able to have one alternate character tagged every two weeks.<br><br>The road is long Fledgling, but you will find assistance, advice and kindness upon the way. <br><br>If you have any difficulties you may contact me at morgyra@aol.com or the council at eqrandomacts@hotmail.com<br><br>Be proactive and seek out guild members near you both in Norrath and here upon the boards. <br><br>For our records it would be helpful if you could provide us with details of your name, class, race, level, playing times, and e-mail address if you have not yet done so. <br><br>Safe journeys to you,  <br><br>Morgaina Oakenshield<br>Proud Member of Random Acts<br> <p><br><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.jsp?num=723"><img src="http://morgaina.no-frills.net/images/morgbackTN.jpg"></a><center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ukellaheartsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kella Heartsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b> RA Member (Kyrstellaine)</span><br>  Posts: 235<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 3:13:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=495.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Wanting to Join!</span><hr size=1> Hi, Merlind, <br><br>I'm interested in chatting with you in game about sponsoring you - I liked your post, but I'd like a chance to actually talk a bit before I say yes, I will definately sponsor you.
