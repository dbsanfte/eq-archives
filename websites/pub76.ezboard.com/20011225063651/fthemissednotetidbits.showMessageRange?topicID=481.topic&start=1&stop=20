<br>
CNN showed George W. Bush leaving HM-1. The marine at the front step saluted, GW returned it, and as he walked away, the marine executed a right face to stand facing GW's back ...something that was missing in eight years of the Clinton presidency.<br>
<br>
The traditional Marine Corps mark of respect was rendered to the new president. That one does back to the days in the rigging, when the marine orderly to the ship's captain always faced him, no matter his direction of movement, to be ready to receive an order.<br>
<br>
Who says that enlisted men can't hold back when they don't respect someone? ...And for eight years, they did.<br>
<br>
The only problem was that Clinton didn't know that he was being snubbed. <p><center><font size=5 font color="FF0000"><i>Sasi</i></font><BR>The Directionally Challenged Bard<br><br><br><br><center>Join the fun at<br><a href=http://server6.ezboard.com/bthemissednote target="web">The Missed Note</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utalnhess.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taln Hess</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.members.home.net/talnhess/head.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000000>(3/7/01 11:11:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.members.home.net/talnhess/sigpic_04.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gotta love a man in uniform!</span><hr size=1> George Bush is president?

Did George Bush ever serve in the military?  I really have no idea.<br>
<br>
Honestly, the military may respect him, and I'm glad to see that he wants to raise military salaries (God knows they deserve it), but Bush kind of scares me.  <br>
<br>
But, as was stated, he will be great for Leno and Dave. <p>Vandaal Steelthorn <BR>

<br>
George W. was an F-4 pilot in the Texas Air National Guard. Whether you consider that being in the military depends on your life experiences, I suppose... <p><a href="http://home.sc.rr.com/thistleburr/thistle_art.jpg"><b>Thistleburr</b></a>, High Priestess of Bristlebane<BR><a href="http://www.the-elitists.com"><i>The Elitists</i></a>, Tribunal Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvandaal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vandaal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bachelor de jour</span><br> <font color=#000000>(3/9/01 11:51:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gotta love a man in uniform!</span><hr size=1> I do consider the National Guard part of the armed forces.  Probably the most important branch, since their main priority is the sanctity of our own borders.  I mean, those Mexican and Canadian armies are pretty frightening!<br>
<br>
Seriously though, I really don't think Bush's past has anything to do with his ability to serve as president.  That remains to be proven and frankly, I'm extremely skeptical.<br>
<br>
Since we're on the topic of politics...I was listening to one of the republican senators talking about Bush's tax cut.  His quote was basically &quot;We're now giving the American people what they asked for when they selected Bush as president.&quot;<br>
<br>
I couldn't help but think &quot;Hmmm...I thought we picked Gore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Too bad about the death of the popular vote.  But I guess that's how it goes.  Are we an oligarchy now?  Or is it a Plutocracy?  Which one is rule by the wealthy?  I can never remember.<br>

 <br>
Gore says he won the popular vote...  Here are a few interesting statistics from a breakdown map of counties won by George Bush and Albert Gore as compiled by law professor Joseph Olson.  The last item is, perhaps, the most telling.<br>
<br>
Counties won by Bush:  2,434<br>
<br>
Counties won by Gore:    677<br>
<br>
Population of counties won by Bush:  143 million<br>
<br>
Population of counties won by Gore:  127 million<br>
<br>
Square miles of country won by Bush:  2,427,000<br>
<br>
Square miles of country won by Gore:    580,000<br>
<br>
States won by Bush:  29<br>
<br>
States won by Gore:  19<br>
<br>
And now for the most remarkable finding...<br>
<br>
Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush:   0.1<br>
Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore:  13.2 <br>
<br>
The Federalist's (http://www.federalist.com) crack staff of researchers found one more interesting fact that might help explain these disparate murder rates.  Gun ownership in the counties won by Mr. Bush is much higher than in the counties won by Mr. Gore! <p><center><font size=5 font color="FF0000"><i>Sasi</i></font><BR>The Directionally Challenged Bard<br><br><br><br><center>Join the fun at<br><a href=http://server6.ezboard.com/bthemissednote target="web">The Missed Note</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usasi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sasi</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://a1060.g.akamai.net/f/1060/597/30minutes/www.zing.com/picture/p9928f00484597486ce443fd18a570305/fed3bcd4.gif width=32 height=32 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Genial Dictator</span><br> <font color=#000000>(3/9/01 2:38:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Speaking of Presidents.....</span><hr size=1> When Bill and Hillary first got married Bill said, "I am putting a box under the bed. You must promise never to look in it." In all their 30 years of marriage Hillary never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash. <br>
<br>
She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why. That evening they were out for a special dinner. After dinner Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, "I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the cans in the box?" <br>
<br>
Bill thought for a while and said, "I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again." <br>
<br>
Hillary was shocked, but said, "Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I am very disappointed and saddened but temptation does happen and I guess that 3 times is not that bad considering the years." They hugged and made their peace. <br>
<br>
A little while later Hillary asked Bill, "So why do you have all that money in the box?" <br>
<br>
Bill answered, "Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash."  <p><center><font size=5 font color="FF0000"><i>Sasi</i></font><BR>The Directionally Challenged Bard<br><br><br><br><center>Join the fun at<br><a href=http://server6.ezboard.com/bthemissednote target="web">The Missed Note</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utalnhess.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taln Hess</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.members.home.net/talnhess/head.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000000>(3/9/01 4:14:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.members.home.net/talnhess/sigpic_04.jpg height=140 width=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Speaking of Presidents.....</span><hr size=1> See, that's the kicker.

<br>
The reason why Clinton won twice was One -- He is extremely smart, smarter then Gore.  Two-- He is personally very likeable.  He basically combined the good attributes of Gore and Bush (he also had one trait neither Gore or Bush have, an atrocious personal control problem)<br>
<br>
Though he was on the left side, Clinton was closer to the center than either Gore or Bush.<br>
<br>
To be honest the choice we had is an indictment of or nomination system.  The parties did not nominate the best, they nominated the guys that their big money donors wanted.  This is true of both Dems and Republicans.  Till our campaign finance system is fixed, we will continue to get rather bad options in our elections.<br>

<br>
I am not saying I dont like either of these candidates or even our current president George Jr. Okay well yes I will say it I dont like the system that restricts us to voting for who they tell us to.<br>
<br>
See we have two parties, even when new parties try to enter the scence they are not respected and shut down. <br>
<br>
I personally hate and villfiy the media in all of this, they are extremely left wing and liberal and it comes across in their &quot; reporting &quot; and how they choose to report items.<br>
<br>
Even more now that a republican in the white house comedians are now political comedians, who think Dubya as they put it, is some drunk moron who got in cause his dad paved the way, and alot of think that because that is what you have been fed. See alot of you are morons, yes you, you believe the media you watch SNL and Dateline believing its only comedy or news, but no, moron the spin is a liberal/democratic view and you bite on it cause your small little mind cannot handle anything else.<br>
<br>
Anyone who believe George Bush Jr. to be a moron only shows how they are sheep easily led by the media. <br>
<br>
I dont like our system, it is too restrictive, but its what we work with, you wont ever see a common man rise to power, everyone will paint themselves as one, but they are not, they come from money or political families, all in all we have a fuedal system with knights and lords and ownership.<br>

See you wish to believe that you have a mind of your own, but you dont, you watch the box and it tells you what to think, how to think, and why you are thinking that. You laugh with the crowd at Jay Leno's jokes when he says the President is a moron. You feel upset when you hear that Clinton admited to cheating on his wife, but the spin is, he apologized and he is human and is more like you, so you can relate. You bought it and continue to buy it.<br>
<br>
See this post shows me the morons in EQ who believe anything they are fed because they dont want to waste the energy doing independent thinking.<br>
<br>
&quot;George Bush was in the military?&quot; Duh, you sound like another uninformed voter who knows not of the candiates except what you are told to know, I bet you know he drank and did coke....see its what you are fed.<br>
<br>
Dont be a moron and think for yourself. <p><center>

How many Monica Lewinsky jokes were there?  Bubba jokes?  McDonald's jokes?  The difference is, with Clinton, people joked about him because he was gettin' his schwerve on in the Oral Office, or because he was a fat guy from Arkansas.  With Bush, he's being made fun of because there is a perception that he does not deserve to be president, that he is not that smart, and that he looks like a monkey.  So far, only the third of those has been confirmed to be true.  Personally, I just hope he does a decent job as president, finds some way to lower my taxes, and keeps us from blowing the world up for the next four years.<br>
<br>
Don't tell me the media is left wing and liberal, because I see just as many right wing conservative slanted articles as left wing liberal ones.  I am so sick and tired of hearing everyone blame the media.  They are just giving the people what they want.  It's not their fault that the majority of the country wants to sit on the couch throwing back bottles of Yoo Hoo while they are told what to think.  <br>
<br>
Besides, every once in a while, extremely rarely, I see an objective article, or as near to objective as you can be.  Those are happy moments for me, and very enlightening.  But writing off &quot;the media&quot; as a singular entity is foolish and myopic.  Try reading some international news outlets if you really want to know what is happening in our country, sometimes they have a new perspective that our own folks may not have considered.<br>
<br>
As for my not knowing Bush was in the military...my bad.  However, it sure as hell isn't going to make him a better politician.  All I care about is his policy, and being president encompasses a whole hell of a lot more than military policy.  Do they teach much about big business or economics or international affairs in the National Guard?  How about environmental policy?  Diplomacy?  Because Bush is going to need to know all of that and more to be effective.  <br>
<br>
As for having a viable candidate in a third party...well, you'll never see that happen until you start seeing some independant senators and representatives, because no third party will ever get anything done without support from the House or the Senate.  <br>
<br>
Did you know that almost a third of voters in the last election considered themselves independant?  It's true, or at least that was how they saw themselves in the exit poles.  Of course, most independants are smart enough to realize that Ralph Nader would get his ass kicked on the hill every day for four years, and it would be a complete waste of time to put him, or any other independant candidate, there.<br>
<br>
You see, I actually DON'T spend my time gazing bleary eyed at the television.  I also don't allow myself to be influenced by either the fishwrap or the local starry eyed newscaster.  I like to find things out on my own.  Yeah, I didn't know that Bush was in the military.  My bad.  Does that one thing make me a moron?  Honestly, I could care less whether the president was in the military or not, so I never bothered to find out.<br>
<br>
By the way, I did know that George Bush drank and did cocaine.  Again, not a factor in deciding if he would be a good president or not, so I really don't care.  I also don't care if he keeps a harem of interns stashed under his desk, or throws down buckets of Crystal and snorts lines of blow in the oval office.  See, I only care that he does a good job as president.  Maybe you should too.<br>
<br>
By the way...A feudal system?  Feudalism was an agricultural system.  We live in a plutocracy.  <br>

<br>
you also said it doesnt matter if he was in the military, that doesnt make him a better politican, well hes not a politican hes the President of the United States, he is also the Commander in Chief, if you dont know what this means, then its this, He is the boss of the military able to command troops without the approval of congress if he so desires. He is the highest ranking officer in the military, thus some military experience might come in handy...oh wait, you didnt know you only thought he was a politician. Well define what you believe a politcian to be, not the dictionary usage, your view.<br>
<br>
See the point you are missing is you are the uninformed voter, you are the person who does lap up the material fed to you and believe that the right wing is evil and the liberals really care about you. Yes I read new stories from alot of sources, and the &quot;main stream&quot; media is liberal, to believe otherwise is just deception of the truth. <br>
<br>
All those you jokes you remember about Clinton, tell me did it make him more lovable or did it paint him as a moron? Come on, be honest with yourself. A good example of this new comedy is Conan O'Brien who for the whole time Clinton was in the white house kept political humor as a rare joke, but as soon as Bush was elected which he was, O'Brien has made 90% of his jokes about politics and about Bush and how dumb he is. <br>
<br>
Another example of liberal bias, when Bush was declared the winner, Katie Couric of the Today show walked off the set in anger, almost in tears. Dan Rather stayed up the night of the election putting hope against hope that something might happen to make Gore the winner. Even more so when Bush did win, it was said several times a great injustice has been done. See the media saw the Bush victory as a democratic defeat which means it cuts straight to their liberal hearts. <br>
<br>
Do you know Bill Clinton raped a woman and had charges filed on him, and the news reporter who had the story but didnt run it because it would destroy Clinton was given a promotion. She buried the story and was rewarded, why did she bury it? Because it was Clinton, now Bush has a DUI on his record from 22 years ago, but suddenly it comes out, and is on every channel. See what you fail to see is the slant, and how it plays in.<br>
<br>
You are still under this delusional cloud that you are a young independent thinker who is a non conformist and willing to open and learn. Its good to believe that, I used to believe that, until one day I asked myself, who decides what we learn and why. <br>
<br>
History is made by those who write it.<br>
<br>
News is made by those who report it.<br>
<br>
98% of the US media considered themselves liberal.<br>
<br>
79% of the US media is registered democrat.<br>
<br>
The people telling how it went down have a vested intrest in how you see it. Its time to wake up, and dont get so offended in a political conversation, you lose your edge. <p><center>

<br>
Before WW2 and the arrival of the universal draft MOST presidents and federal politicians served NO time in the military.  It is only an offshoot of the massive mobilazation of WW2 that all the presidents before Clinton had served in the military.  It is no judge of how they will do as president or commander-in-chief.<br>
<br>
One of our worst presidents ever was Ulysses S. Grant who was one of the best generals we ever had.  One of the best presidents, Frankilin Roosevelt served NO time in the military.<br>
<br>
Now as to Bush's &quot;service&quot;.  I was in the regular military.  The Air National Gaurd is barely a military organization.  Especially at the time he served.  They were weekend warriors at BEST full of people ducking out of the draft.  At least Gore served in the regular army (even if his daddy made sure he was kept out of harm's way)  But the military record of either one says very little about how well they would lead.  It even gives them vey little insight into todays military.  It was a draftee force then.  The problems and concearns are far differnt now with an all-volunteer force.<br>
<br>
As to the media, it does lean to to the left but not anywhere NEAR what you seem to think.  The media has an anti-establishment bias.  It goes after whoever is in power.  Democrat or Republican.  <br>
<br>
Where was the &quot;liberal&quot; bias when Gary Hart was caught with his pants down?  Or when Hillary was nearly drawn and quartered over the her attempt at Healthcare reform.  And Bill did not get a free ride.  The entire last 2 years of his term was nothing but &quot;That Woman&quot;  And I watch the comedy shows too.  I saw at least 2 or 3 jokes about Clinton nightly on each show.  Especially in his last 2 years.  Only the MOST partisan members of the media on both sides would let there bias get in the way of a story or a joke.  As to the other accusation?  Well till I see a police report it is just a load of *&amp;^%.  While I don't think there was any &quot;right wing conspiracy&quot;.  There were some extreamists on the right who would float as truth the most stupid and unbelievable rumors.  Why don't we bring up the murder suspicions etc. while we are at it.<br>
<br>
Bush has never shown a deep understanding of the positions he holds.  This may simply be an inability to articualte why he taken this or that stance or it may be another problem.  This worries me BUT the people he has selected to serve around him DO seem to have a good grasp on their areas of expertise.  This is good even if I do not agree with thier views.<br>
<br>
As to the election,  It was a tie for all intents.  Accept that.  Bush did not win, he was chosen by the The Supream Court.   Decisions (both federal and at the state level) were horrendous.  The state court tried to do the impossible.  Get a FULL accurate count out of a system that would not allow that.  The Federal Court basically played kingmaker but tried to pretend it wasn't.  They CHOSE Bush and came up with a legal justification for it.  Now don't get me wrong it NEEDED to be done because there was no way a clear winner was ever going to be known short of this.  The margin was to thin and the possible error rate was too large.<br>
<br>
Niether man really endeared themselves to anyone outside thier liberal/conservative base.  Neither was the best option out there.  Which probably explains the closeness more than anything else.  The scary thing is that if Clinton had been allowed to run again, I lay odds he would have won handedly.  He is just to damn good at playing the game.  Then we could have another 4 years of &quot;The White House Turns&quot;  &lt;shudder&gt; <p><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Warenherz</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Ranger of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>The Eternal Conclave</font></b><br><img src=http://home.att.net/~h.e.williamson/source/tiger_run_md_clr.gif>

Sorry I didn't clarify.  Still, we live in a plutocracy, I'm sure you know what that is, so I won't stoop to petty debate tactics by posting the definition.<br>
<br>
Last time I checked, the Presidency was a political office.  Yes, he is the Commander in Chief (again, your assumptions regarding me are what are insulting, not your political views), and yes, he can make military decisions without consulting congress.  Nevertheless, I am more interested in his policy decisions regarding the environment, the economy, and foreign policy than his ability to lead the military, because I seriously doubt that Bush will issue any military commands without consulting others first.<br>
<br>
If you think Bush is a &quot;millitary man&quot; before he is a politican, then you are seriously deluded.  Bush is a politician who was in the military, but he is a politician before all else.  <br>
<br>
Where do you get these assumptions that I am a liberal?  From the fact that I asked if Bush was in the military?  Talk about putting the cart before the horse.  I am neither liberal or conservative.  It's not black or white.  I don't believe that the &quot;right wing&quot; is evil, or that the &quot;liberals&quot; care about me.  Hell, I want a tax break, I want fiscally conscious environmental policy that won't lead us to disaster, I want increased salaries for military personnel, I want abortion to remain legal (with constraints), and I want peace.  Not sure if that makes me liberal or conservative.  Probably a little of both.  Is that possible in your world view, DM?<br>
<br>
Honestly, the assumptions you have made about my personal politics based on one simple question are so ridiculous it's barely worth debating.  Normally, I would simply tell you to go stuff yourself, but since I actually think you're a pretty nice guy, I'm witholding.  But please, keep in mind that all these assumptions you are making about me, that I am:<br>
<br>
Liberal<br>
Uninformed<br>
A sheep<br>
A moron<br>
<br>
Are based on the fact that I asked one question.  That's quite a stretch.<br>
<br>
Also, just so you know, I don't watch Leno, or Dave, or Conan, or Dan Rather, or the Today Show.  In fact, I don't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> watch</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> any news.  Television news has one purpose:  Sell advertising, and I'm not really interested in watching 59 minutes of blather for 1 minute of worthwhile information.  I watch sports, I listen to various news radio, and I read several newspapers, magazines, and internet websites.  Sorry to shatter your unfounded opinons of me.<br>
<br>
I agree with you on the fact that history is written by the victors, and that no new is objective.  Objectivity is impossible.  However, a smart person can read the news from liberal sources, get the facts, and make up their own minds.  Of course, conservatives like yourself apparently think that everyone else is of inferior intellect and is incapable of doing that.<br>
<br>
As far as the Clinton rape goes...I'm with Radgen on that.  Sounds like another edition of &quot;The Clinton Files&quot;.  I find it very hard to believe that a story like that would remain hidden.  In fact, I find it impossible to believe.  If the woman was raped, surely she could get someone to listen to her.  Unless of course Clinton strangled her afterwards.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I see Sasi finally got your title to stick.  Also, does our debate mean I can't have accesss to Iksar pr0n? <p>Vandaal Steelthorn <BR>
