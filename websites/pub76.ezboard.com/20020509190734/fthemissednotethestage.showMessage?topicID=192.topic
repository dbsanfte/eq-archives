The candle, which lights the small room, is snuffed out by the swirling breeze and in the darkness it seems to whisper in the ear of the weary old bard.<br>After much rummaging in his packs an old fire beetle eye is brought forth and drives back the darkness. <br><br>The heated arguing of bards can be heard coming from the main meeting hall. &quot;What have I done?&quot; mumbles the man in his dented and dusty blue armor. He remembers a time when with a spring in his step and a twinkle in his eye he made an announcement to his old guild. &quot;I must be leaving you now my friends. I have the opportunity to follow the dream I have pursed all my life. That of being in an all bard guild!&quot;<br>The old bard bows his head and sighs under the weight of the memory.<br><br>The eerie glow from the beetle eye casts strange shadows on the walls of the little room. They take the shapes of young bards from Cinnabar's past. Those he has had to discipline, reprimand or remove from the Blessed Bards entirely. They mock him with quiet shadowy gazes. The Bard mumbles softly, &quot;so many failures, such bitterness, so much time lost.&quot; <br><br>The mischievous breeze again swirls around the room, whispering. <br><br>Cinnabar stops in the midst of his brooding and listens to the voice on the wind. It speaks a truth deep into the heart of the bard. His hand drops to his waist where his tambourine hangs. With a rattle, the spell of gloom is dispelled and Cinn knows what must be done.<br><br>With the speed of only a bard who has traveled the planes could match, Cinnabar gathers his things for a journey.<br><br>&quot;PSSSSSSSST&quot;, a noise similar to giant moss snake breaks the stride of the rushing bard.<br>&quot;Booberry, are youse out dere?&quot; says a familiar voice from a grate in the floor. A finger the size of a salami pokes up through the grate and wiggles vigorously. &quot;Yooo Hoooos! Cinnabar looks down into the grate and sees the smiling face of his old ogre buddy, Tunder Traincrusher. <br><br>&quot;Can youse come outs and play today? It been long time now since you drop me off mountain wit dat lev song. Mes all better now.&quot; The tusked grin of the ogre Tunder sparks an irrepressible feeling in Cinn, one that had been missing from his life for so long. A smile cracks the mask of the world weary bard and the years lift from his shoulders.<br><br>A shout comes from behind Tunder with a decidedly dwarven accent. &quot;Move your huge misbegotten posterior you overfed halfling!&quot; The smiling Ogre is replaced by a warhammer raining a flurry of blows upon the grate from beneath. Whether the grate is knocked free by the might of a dwarven hammer or melted by the cursing coming from dwarven lips is open for debate. In either case with a crash the grate flys into the room followed by a disheveled and decidlely hairy dwarf named Meeshackhansred.<br><br>&quot;Get your kit you limp wristed blue gadfly. Time is a wasting. There be buxom lasses out there be chased and were not getting any younger standing here.&quot; Meesh begins grabbing the packs scattered about the room and tossing them down the hole where they are met with thumps that sound like an overripe melon being abused, or an Ogre head being bonked. <br><br>Meesh jumps down the hole with a hurumph and a thump. While the bemused bard with his long lost spring in his step and sparkle to his eye picks up the one kit that is actually his and heads to the hole in the floor.<br><br>In passing the table with his proposal, Cinnabar stops and places his old hand drum upon the stack of papers. He concentrates for but a moment and feels his ethereal bonding to the Blessed Bards sever and drift away on the persistent breeze still swirling in the room. <br><br>With a flash of blue sparks Cinn follows his friends into the Freeport sewers and off to adventure. <br><br>In the dim glow of the beetle eye can be seen the ages old engraving on the hand drum left behind &quot;SAFE TRAVELS TO ALL&quot;. Every so faintly can be seen a new engraving, so light that it might have been brushed on by a passing breeze.<br>~~~ Have fun. It's only a game. ~~~ <br><br><br>Cinnabar Harbinger<br>A Commander in the Blessed Bards of Norrath<br>…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………<br><br>The above story was originally posted on the BBoN boards.  Some of you may know Cinnabar.  He is currently enjoying life as a member of Legendary.  I just wanted to share this with you.
