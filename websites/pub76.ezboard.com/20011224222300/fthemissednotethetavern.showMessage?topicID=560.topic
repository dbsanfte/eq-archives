Many miles and dreams away, a solitary bard lifts her head as if listening, the expression in her eyes slowly changing from surprise to delight.  <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting" size=5 font color="FF0000"><b><i>Sasi</i></b></font><br>The Directionally Challenged Bard</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/usasisolitaire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sasi Solitaire</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/nwnote.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#000000>(11/30/01 1:13:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=560.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/SasiWept.gif width=116 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rebirth......</span><hr size=1> With no armor and few possessions, Sasi has little to gather for her journey.   Her packs are filled with her instuments and food she has paid for with a song.   Clutching her precious drum, given to her years ago on her wedding day, she slowly begins playing the ancient song.  Once again, she feels the the  magic that lifts her feet and gives her the flight of eagles.  <br>
<br>
Lands streaking past far below, she leaves without a backward glance.   Neither man nor beast can slow her journey.   Only exhaustion brings her back to earth for quick naps before once again lifting into the sky; only pangs of hunger brings her mind from visions of her past briefly back to the present.  <br>
<br>
Oceans now rushing beneath her feet, miles of whitecaps seemingly without end, serving as a backdrop to her memories......<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  The day The Missed Note was given to her and the faces of so many lost friends who had gathered there to celebrate it's opening.  Brave Thistleburr, delightful little Fizzlebee - where were they now?  Kalaz, fierce yellowbeard and the gruff Doraxx..... loyal Darkmask......  sweet Radgen.... so many friends.... so many memories!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
Smiles and tears mix on Sasi's face as memories flicker like a magic lantern show.   Her mind keeps sheering away from the memory of the most important face from her past.  Like a moth burned by the flame..... alternately drawn to and yet fleeing the pain..... Sasi tries to keep her focus.   She knows instintively that if she dwells on thoughts of him, she would never return.   <br>
<br>
And Sasi longs to return!  The Missed Note had been her home - the only place she had ever been truly happy.   And after..... after..... (she forces her mind violently away from the thought)  it had become her only reason for being.  She is excited to be returning after so many years..... but she is fearful as well.   Fearful that she is not yet strong enough to go back.   Fearful that the reason for her abandoning the inn is still too much alive in her.  Fearful that she won't be able to cope with the one memory she has worked so hard to forget.<br>
<br>
Immersed in dreaming, Sasi speeds over Freeport without noticing.   Flying over the Commons, she suddenly feels dreadfully afraid.   She halts abruptly on top of a high hill near the guardpost and tries to quiet her pounding heart.   Drawing deep calming breaths, she slowly walks through the remaining Commons until the scent of woodsmoke makes her eyes widen and her steps falter.   <br>
<br>
Forcing one foot before another, she climbs to the top of a small hillock and sees the inn in the distance.........   <br>

It's almost as though, for a few brief seconds, her lungs forget how to work. <br>
<br>
Drawing deep breaths to loosen the tightness, she sinks down and rests under a small tree on the hillock and simply stares. The vision of the inn is misty seen through her tears of recognition. Long moments stretch as she gazes down upon the small wooden structure that had once contained so much life and joy. <br>
<br>
By squinting her eyes just a bit, Sasi can make out the burned spots on the roof where Doraxx had mended the damage of two different fires. She knows without seeing it that the stuffed marlin from Amberly will still be on the wall. The sound of the gently moving stream reminds her of the picnics held on it's banks and of the food fight with the irascible Pikel. A small sigh escapes her as she thinks of the bright dagger so deeply imbedded over the bar..... a memorial for a light hearted rogue who had once loved her. <br>
<br>
The sight of the small door build inside the larger door brings a smile to her face as she remembers Thistleburr having tea at one of the diminutive tables and chairs inside the inn. The place had been build to accommodate all sizes from the tiny Fizzlebee to the humonous Chum. Even the beds had been build with all the various shapes to be found in Norrath in mind.<br>
<br>
Preoccupied with her memories, Sasi's hands seek out and find her instruments as if they need no direction from her. Softly strumming, she is unaware that tears have been making their way down her cheeks until one drips onto the back of her hand. With a startled laugh, she brushes the tears away and takes a deep cleansing sigh as her fingers began moving faster and faster on her instruments. As her playing becomes louder, her laughter rings out to accompany it and she floats high in the air on the strands of music and joy. <br>
<br>
Her happiness seems to be bursting out of her by way of her fingertips and she feels as light as the clouds she almost touches. By alternating her music, she tumbles across the sky, laughter streaming behind her like the bright red tail of a berserk kite. The fear is gone..... replaced by pure unadulterated joy!<br>

Zoya had gone on a quest for her noble order, never to heard from again.  He had spent months trying to find some sign or trail of her passing in vain.  She had simply vanished.  Except in the haze of the past.<br>
<br>
Shaking his head to clear it of the dark thoughts haunting him.  He heard a familiar sound coming from behind him.

The whole world seems to celebrate with her as the wind catches up her song and sends it to the birds to spread.   The sun contributes by painting the earth in warm gold tones and sparkles off the glass windows of the inn.   Her hair, uncut since leaving the inn, now floats about Sasi's face as she slows her dancing and begins to drift down to earth again still singing her joy.  <br>
<br>
Coming to ground at last, Sasi catches sight of a familiar figure on the path in front of her.    Her eyes widen in shocked surprise as she recognizes the man about to enter the inn and she forgets just how fast her drums have been propelling her.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;RADGEN!!  Oh, my gosh, Radgen!!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->   she sings as she rushes to catch up with him.   Just as he turns, a frown on his face, Sasi collides full on with him and they both tumble out of breath to the ground.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Radgen, my old friend!  This is wonderful!   How did you know?   I can't believe I'm seeing you again!

<br>
