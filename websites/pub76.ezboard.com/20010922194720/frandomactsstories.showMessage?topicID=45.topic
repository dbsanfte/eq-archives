hold things that I can give away to <br>

some board members in charge of armory<br>

We could have a mule team. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Perhaps it would be a good idea if one of our members took up the responsibility of the treasury, perhaps creating a position on the board as the banker.  If I might be so bold as to nominate someone, I believe Tindar would do an excellent job in this position, seeing that he travels alot on his own, and that he will, without a doubt, attend all the events we sponsor.  Not only does he have these qualifications, but he seems to be one of the most zealous participants in spreading our kindness. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I don't believe a null character would necessarily be in order to do this, however, if one is created, I'd suggest someone do it with a Barbarian Shaman, fast transportation after level 9, and high strength.  Hmm... give me 20 levels and we can avoid the weight problem, I'll just start hoarding weight reducing packs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
The existance of the Treasury could have any number of purposes.  It could fund our events, as in buying patterns and/or pelts for patchwork armor, or in helping out all our members buy helping them upgrade their equipment.  While I'd be more in favor of the first option, I will not shun either.  If the position is created, or if the treasury is started, be sure to talk to me, I'd love to help start it.<br>

<br>
If Tindar will accept the position of Banker<br>
for Random Acts I know he would be very<br>
trustworthy. And I would also like Ealwen<br>
to be a Banker Boardmember too. I know, I know<br>
Ealwen, you are off hunting and leveling<br>
up somewhere off in the wilds of Norrath.<br>
But I think you come up with very good<br>
ideas and you could be a back up for<br>
Tindar for when he is not available.<br>
What if he gets sick or his computer gets<br>
sick?<br>
<br>
So I think Ealwen should have a back up<br>
supply of things in his bank or on a mule<br>
in the bank. It's not necessary to play<br>
the character. I have a level one character<br>
just holding stuff. <br>
<br>
As always, I am glad to offer my assistance<br>
to any board member or officer if they<br>
need it.<br>
<br>
If you two will take these positions, I<br>
would say we are in business! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Banking o items hath two parts,<br>
collection and distribution.  To properly and timely collect items ye need to hae stationary people in cities so that collected items may be put into a bank.  To distribute items ye need a means to move them from these stationary people, that is the couriers.  Basically what we need to do is a hand-me-down process.  When ye finally get that item that is better than one ye own, instead of selling the item ye give it to a vault character in the closest town.  The vault items are then listed in a treasury of sorts.  When a younger person needs an item, a courier meets with the correct vault character and takes the item to the younger player who is less likely to be able to travel safely.  In addition the courier can take distribute items to other vaults as needed.<br>
<br>
Here are some suggestions for common vault items.<br>
1) Silver Jewelry, great to give to young ere they can afford it themselves, and they will hopefully outgrow them and return them to the vault later.<br>
2) Tailored and Smithed Armor in most sizes.  Again useful to the young, but also left over from training.<br>
3) Quality Non-magical Weapons.  Sure we will hae magical ones, but when young a Fine Steel weapon is more useful than a weak magical one.<br>
4) Lightstones and Greater Lightstones.<br>
5) Rare trade skill items like HQ Bearskins to be used to make items hard to come by.<br>
6) Food and Water, and perhaps ale.  Baking and Brewing can provide these.<br>
<br>
I nae recommend giving away money, instead I prefer to teach others to make money, however if ye feel someone deserves them money, take em shopping and show em what best to purchase.<br>
<br>
An item sold to a vendor ends up way inflated in price, giving money to buy such items is wasteful, instead give them the items from a vault an ye will be able to help more people.  Teach em to fish an they nae need to buy food.<br>
<br>
*hugs*<br>
--Charmelle<br>

PS  My courier service is free, just let me know when I can help ye. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/brandomacts.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=karal>Karal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local user</span><br>   <font color=#006400>(6/28/00 10:54:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few ideas, Hamadryad you decide if you like</span><hr size=1> Hi All,<br>
