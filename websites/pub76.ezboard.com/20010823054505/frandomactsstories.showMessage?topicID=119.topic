For those who don't know, Overthere is essentially Lake of Ill Omen for evil characters--the first outpost where you hunt in Kunark. Ogres, trolls, and Dark Elves are fine here. Gnomes that are agnostic or follow an evil God are also ok. To my knowledge, everyone else, including iksar, are KOS--if you are unsure, progress as if you are KOS and then go around to the front, there's a HUGE golem guard that you can con for quite a distance and everything in the Outpost is on the same faction.<br>
<br>
When Can You Go and Why You Should:<br>
You can hit the overthere at 15th level. Groups are easy to come by. All classes are generally needed. The easy side of OT starts to peter out in the early 20s. After that, you'll either go to the lake or head into Warsilks Woods to the Giant Fort. The loot is far better than anything you are going to come across in oasis.<br>
<br>
Why You Should Go Here and not the Lake:<br>
There are a large variety of creatures here, but unlike the Lake, only one, the Sarnaks, aggro. You can also go to The Overthere a few levels earlier than you can go to the Lake. The trip to OT is faster from Freeport. While there are plenty of idiots in the Overthere, the general zone maturity level is much higher than &quot;the Lake of Ill Manners.&quot; And being KOS at the docks is much easier to avoid than the Drachnids in FV.<br>
<br>
What to do before you leave:<br>
Figure out what you need and bring only that. Leave all your coin at home and bring as many empty containers as you can carry. You won't be able to buy in OT and even if you could, the clockwork thieves sell anywhere from double to quadruple the prices on the mainland and buy for maybe 1/3rd of the price you'll get back in Freeport. Bring plenty of food, water, and bandages.<br>
<br>
Getting To The Overthere:<br>
The journey to Overthere starts with the Barrel Barge in Oasis. Get on the barge and it will take you to Ogre Island. You jump off and wade to shore, then take a right. You will come to an ogre town with some docks. If you are good, you WILL be KOS to the ogres, but as long as you're reasonably cautious, you can get to the dock without a problem. None of the ogres spawn within aggro range of the dock or the path to the dock, so your only risk is if someone is fighting them and trains them out. They're ogres, they're large and easy to see--don't worry aboutit. Go out to the end of the first dock and wait for The Bloated Belly, which is the most bizarre looking boat you're ever going to ride on. Get on it and it will take you to The Overthere. Once you zone in, the boat will dock and this time you will be killed by the guards. So you'll probably want to jump off as soon as you see it getting near shore. There is a large wall that juts out into the water to the left of the dock (this is visible to the boat and your cue to jump NOW). You want to swim to the wall and the follow it to the shore. This wall forms the boundary of the Outpost and inside you can bind--melee characters should hug the inside wall and swim to the shore and you can safely bind here, then swim back out and around. Casters can obviously just swim around it and bind wherever they want. Chances are when you swim to shore you'll find a group from your voyage already binding there. If not, you shout for a bind, and have a good chance of getting one.<br>
<br>
What to do when you're there:<br>
The NorthEast section of the zone is the low end section. Most of the action orients around &quot;the mudhole&quot; (roughly 2000/-3000 on the map). Get a group, kill stuff, take their money--you should have figured this out by this level! There's usually plenty of people at the mudhole. You should be able to find a group within a few minutes and if you get overwhelmed there's enough people there to act as defacto guards if you /y for help. Cockatrice beaks, sabretooth teeth, and a variety of other items sell for a plat apiece. The Sarnak recruits sometimes carry a platinum coin. Con everything, there are two flavors of each monster, one lower level, one higher. And very occasionally, idiots train stuff over from the dangerous side.<br>
<br>
What not to do:<br>
Even if you're not KOS, don't buy or sell. Do not go out of the Northeast zone. The Overthere is a divided zone, it's good from levels 15-23 and from 30-45. Between those levels, there's not much. The lower level zone is east from the fortress along the coast to the zone border and then south to the giant statue and the Warsilks Woods zone--then more or less make that a square. Within that safe zone, you're pretty safe. Just don't mess around with the sarnak fort, they are much higher level. <br>
<br>
Where Else Can You Go Nearby:<br>
At about 20th level you can hunt giants in the Fortress in Warsilks Woods. No really. At that level you can hunt giants, no kidding! Really. Yeah, giants. If you're more adventurous, get an invis and go through WW to the field of bone and there's some interesting hunting in Kurn's Tower basement. If you have invis or you're good at navigation and evasion, or otherwise don't mind dangerous runs, you can run through Frontier Mountains and get to the Lake. <br>
<br>
Getting Home:<br>
You have to swim out to the boat and climb on it yourself (try climbing up the edge of a barrel). I haven't verified it works with the Belly, but the general strategy for evils on boats is to swim around where it's going to go after it departs and wait in it's path and most boats will scoop you up if you allow them to cruise over you--this is jokingly referred to by evil characters as &quot;climbing in the hole in the hull&quot;. This is not an easy skill, the first time I tried it was with a Dark Elf who swam around the Butcherblock harbor through 3 full cycles of the Freeport boat. The EQatlas says you do not have to catch the boat in motion, but can board on the ocean side of it while docked, huddle there, and you'll be far enough from the guards to avoid aggro--I have not done this myself. Invisibility won't work either, the guards are undead iksar. After you get on the boat, you just reverse the process at the Ogre Island. You will have to wade out and climb aboard the barrel barge, which will deposit you back on Oasis.  <p>Numtini Lightheart <br>

Note that I've only passed through here, not really hunted, and it's written from a bard's point of view.<br>
<br>
You can in fact board the boat while it's stopped - I've done it.  You can also swim around a little bit from the dock, then board the boat at the furthest point from the pier you can and crank up invis - the skelly shouldn't come that far out.<br>
<br>
You can get around much of the outpost invisible, but as Numtini mentions some of the guards are undead Iksar (the others near the docks are DE Dragoons, not sure what else is around).<br>
<br>
A high-level SoW or Selo's with a drum can get you easily and quickly to the FM zone without trouble - you're going to fast to get aggro'd unless you step on a Sarnak's tail.  Just skirt the Outpost, pick up the road and head south.  When it turns east, look for the huge set of columns (you can't miss it!) and turn south again.  Run up to the ledge and through the pass to FM, and from there you can get to Lake of Ill Omen.<br>
<br>
FWIW, if I'm on Antonica and need to get to Kunark, I take this route rather than going to BBM and FV first.  Much faster in my opinion.<br>
<br>
At least one human agnostic bard reported not being KoS in the outpost.  Your mileage may vary.<br>
<br>
Dragoons occaisionally patrol the road between the outpost and the Frontier Mountain zone, particularly at night.<br>
<br>
I have heard that you can use Sneak (if you have it) to sell to the merchants - sneak first, approach from the side, and you'll be indifferent.  Haven't been brave enough to try it myself.<br>
<br>
By the mudhole, bards from about 20-24 can reportedly solo here using an all-instrument attack (see the Hunting Guide at www.eqdiva.com).  Might be possible from about 18th (when you get Denon's Disruptive Dischord) if you have decent armor.<br>
<br>
Also, the scorpion claws are a magical wind instrument, as good and possibly better than a minotaur's horn (which is +15% to your songs).  Data is inconclusive at last check.<br>
<br>
Nice guide, Num!<br>
