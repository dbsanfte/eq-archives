I play most evenings from 6/7pm EST to 12am and quite a bit on the weekends as well.  <br><br>I have been looking for quite awhile for a guild that I felt I could be proud being a member of and also that was worth committing myself to.  Many of the guilds I have encountered are focused solely on leveling and looting, which leaves out a large portion of the fun and content of the game.  Anyone these days can level a character 1-50+ fairly quickly and painlessly simply by hunting in 4 zones, and in the end are lvl 50 newbies instead of lvl 1 newbies with the skills to match.  From my experience and viewpoint RA takes the time to appreciate the many other aspects of the game and at the same time gives something back to the world around them.  <br><br>I have benefited from RA's FA camps a few times and had the pleasure of collecting shattering hammers at the recent Fishing Contest (won enough cash to by my lvl 9 spells) as my woodelf druid.  I've been in groups with some RA members in the past though as other characters and have always been impressed with their maturity and style of play.  I have also inquired about the guild as a whole to others and people had nothing but good things to say about RA.  And all of these things have contributed to my decision to apply for membership.<br><br>I am informed of your application procedures and have already acquainted myself with your charter and guidelines and have plans to attend your Warrens hunt this Saturday just to hang around.  Also, the Fledgling Quest will not be a problem and I already have the person selected.  I look forward to meeting everyone and finding a sponsor for my application.  Happy hunting!<br><br>Jaered<br>Shaman of The Tribunal<br>24th Winter<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/umorgania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morgania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 368<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 10:26:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Application</span><hr size=1> Hi there, Jaered<br><br>Thank you for applying for membership of our guild and may I take this opportunity to wish you success in your application. <br><br>We have an application procedure that you will be required to complete in order to enter into full membership of the guild. I have listed the steps below.<br><br>1. Apply in this forum (check!)<br><br>2. Read the Call and Charter. <br>The Call and Charter detail the principles that our Guild are based upon and to proceed you should be in broad agreement with them. You can find details of them at www.eqrandomacts.com. Also reading our Mission Statement and Ethical Guidelines to see what we are all about is important as learning as much about who we are and what we are about will help you make an informed decision about joining us.<br><br>3. Attend Random Acts Events<br>There are three main reasons for this, it is fun, you get to meet lots of guild members and most importantly you will need to seek out a sponsor. Details of upcoming events can be found on this message board under Events, Hunting and Gathering.<br><br>4. Find a Sponsor <br>A sponsor is a regular guild member that will mentor you through the fledgling quest/community service and support you in your application. It is also hoped that you will form a special relationship with your sponsor. Your sponsor will also be responsible for you. You can find who is on at any one time by typing the command &lt;/who all random&gt; <br>(Note: Guild members can sponsor more than one fledgling.)<br><br>5. Perform Fledgling Quest or Community Service quest<br>Details of the quest can be found at www.eqrandomacts.com and you can perform either one with the assistance and advice of your sponsor.<br><br>6. Guild Tagging <br>Upon successful completion of your Quest, your sponsor must notify Meriel Silvertree or Gwion Llwellyn either by posting here on the board, or through a tell in game, you will then receive your Random Acts Tag at the next scheduled First Aid Camp (FA).<br>First Aid Camps are generally held every two weeks, the first one on a Saturday, and the next one on a Sunday.<br><br>7. Probationary Membership<br>Probationary Membership will last until you attend the *next* regularly scheduled FA and barring any difficulties you will be accepted into the guild as a full member.<br><br>8. Alternate Characters<br>You will be able to have one alternate character tagged every two weeks.<br><br>The road is long Fledgling, but you will find assistance, advice and kindness upon the way. <br><br>If you have any difficulties you may contact me at morgyra@aol.com or the council at eqrandomacts@hotmail.com<br><br>Be proactive and seek out guild members near you both in Norrath and here upon the boards. <br><br>For our records it would be helpful if you could provide us with details of your name, class, race, level, playing times, and e-mail address if you have not yet done so. <br><br>Safe journeys to you,  <br><br>Morgaina Oakenshield<br>Proud Member of Random Acts<br> <p><br><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.jsp?num=723"><img src="http://morgaina.no-frills.net/images/morgbackTN.jpg"></a><center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uwiplshaman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WiplShaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 10:38:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Application</span><hr size=1> From one Barb shaman to another.

It was both refreshing and frustrating at the same time, as most of us take for granted all the seemingly trivial things it takes to get started in EQ.  Anyway, they were 2 RL friends that started playing recently and getting them settled into the world of EQ was interesting to say the least.  To make a long story short, Oggmar is now a lvl 4 ogre warrior who no longer gets killed by accidentally attacking his guildmaster due to faulty key layout and is actually making his own hot-keys now while murderlizing frogloks in Innothule; and Moglo is a lvl 4 gnome magician who now knows where to go to find out just what his spells really do and what meditate is for.  I spent awhile buffing and healing as they settled into their xp grind and both left thinking this was the greatest thing since sliced bread...=)  Anyway, I'm unsure who exactly I should tell since I haven't seen wipl or oggarbugg around the last few days, but I think my Fledgling Quest can be considered complete!<br><br>Also, I had a good time grouping with Eed (can't remember the full name since i abbr. in group) in South Karana smashing some gnolls and Spydaer in Dalnir's wooping up on nibbler and coerced mobs the past few days.<br><br>Jaered<br>Shaman of The Tribunal<br>29th Winter <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uwiplshaman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WiplShaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/02 6:24:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=494.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Application</span><hr size=1> WOOT!
