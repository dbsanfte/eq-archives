<br>
The City of Mist is essentially two zones, one laid over the other. On the ground is your standard buildings and what not, there's a castle you go into... and then you pass through a hidden wall. The hidden wall leads you up onto a transparent walkway which ascends skyward. Wrapping around almost the entirety of the zone is another set of buildings above the City of Mist itself. <br>
<br>
Getting up to this without single pulling Neh is... difficult at best. The lower area of the city of mist (And the upper, but the spawns are fewer and far between) are a mix of undead and living. Both the undead and living are highly aggressive, hence the issue. Inserting a raid, or even a party, into the deep areas of CoM is borderline impossible. (Though, anything is possible.) If you can't single pull Neh then you have to bust through the entirety of the zone, which is far from hard if you have the caliber of group(s) to take down Neh, but it's exceedingly time consuming. A wipeout is incredibly time consuming. If your clerics die, it's also incredibly time consuming given the incessant amount of time spent on corpse retrieval, then rebreaking. <br>
<br>
Call of the Hero could be put to quite good use here with a well placed gravity flux... But not everyone has a few 55+ mages hanging around. =P <br>
<br>
The other major issue when breaking is the zone itself. The pathing on the lower level of City of Mist is just TERRIBLE. I've never seen such bad pathing at work. We had a particularly bad wizard on the raid who was quite prone to overnuking, when she would the goos/bones etc would break off of the tank, run the opposite way of the wizard, and then swing back around. She stayed alive because of it, but numerous times this brought along ads or just ugly trains. <br>
<br>
Likewise, when you're pulling to clear an area and the mob runs the opposite way of you, stand and die. It's FAR better to have one person die than 12-20. I watched with my very own eyes as our puller attempted to pull a mob in front of us, directly, and watched the mob immediately turn around and then come running back with 10 or more of their friends. For pullers, it's not a bad idea to escort your pulls back, don't let the pathing go crazy on ya, take a few hits coming back, to save you a bunch of hits in the future. =) <br>
<br>
Also, if you are inserting the good ol' fashioned way into COM upper, you're going to need a rogue. Make sure that your rogue has two sets of lockpicks on them, and then have the rogue duel someone, die, and leave the other set of lockpicks on his dueled body. Should you have a wipeout you won't have to send a druid/wizard off to fetch some lockpicks, this can hold your raid down for an hour or more. <br>
<br>
Now, as for the upper areas themselves they are quite straightforward, at least deceptively so at first. =) <br>
<br>
Have levitate on at all times, don't get lazy, bring yourselves tons of batwings, and a mage who can summon a few rings for everyone, so that if a meleers lev is going midcombat, he doesn't have to ask for it and be missed, and then potentially fall off to his death. The fall from Kael ramp in EW looks to be about half of the height of falling from the top of City of Mist, so, if you fall off from non-glux then you'll probably be taking 10k, 20ish if there wasn't a cap. =P That's right a fall from COM could possibly KOS Nagafen if he took falling damage =P (if that doesn't convince you to always have lev on, I dunno what will.) <br>
<br>
As an enchanter I paid a lot of attention to the z-axis and the things below to see how area effect spells would work. To be honest, I don't recommend using AEs up top. Most monsters below don't appear to have a direct pathing route underneath the catwalks, but it's just not a bright idea if you color flux or AE mez a mob hundreds of feet below you. <br>
<br>
The fight with Neh and the black reavers up top are incredibly interesting. The black reavers (and Neh) are almost 100 percent magic resistant. People say the same thing about dozens of monsters, for example the Ry'gorr emissary. I've had dozens of spells stick on the Ry'gorr emissary, with a tashania I couldn't even get a root to stick on the reavers. <br>
<br>
Thus, to interrupt the various casts you'll encounter, you'll need to bash... But bashing will knock them back, possibly over the edge... Which will cause a HUGE train upon their return, and Neh will begin to summon people from below. <br>
<br>
If any mob up top gets knocked off, immediately camp, first thing you do before you even see them hit the ground is hit that camp key. <br>
<br>
The best thing is of course to avoid this, make sure all your tanks know when to pull mobs back. And they need to do it QUICKLY because if you don't, that will be non bashing time, which means better casting time. You need to be precise here. <br>
<br>
Also, this is an absolute must, several of the boss mobs, including reavers blind. The blindness is bad, when combined with the fact you are hundreds of the feet in the air, it's even worse, it's like they are popping you with a 20k nuke. =P If you're hit by a blindness, stop... Stop moving, don't do anything until the blindness stops. If you hear a screaming sound, then a splat, ok, it's time to curse. But the absolute best thing to do is let the blindness do itself, and keep your hands as far away from your movement keys as you can. =)Now, if you're a meleer, this is gonna present some issues, as if you are still getting hit while blind (Which is a probability considering you were high enough on the hate list before) Then you need to listen for damage. Recall where you were before, if you were close to the edge behind you then you need to periodically move forward a bit to account for bashes. Only a little bit, or you will fall to your death. If the edge was in front of you, then just sit tight and hope for the best. Mind you, if you're prone to whirling when stunning, that is going to be a problem, and if you're worried about that, then just sit tight and hope the other tanks can taunt it off of you so you don't get bashed off. <br>
<br>
One other issue, the room where Neh appears in, the last room, has a false bottom just underneath the outcropping in the center of the room. It's quite easy to fall through, and even with lev, there's a buttload of monsters beneath. If you're a caster, try to gate while you float down, if you're a meleer, page up until you are facing straight up to stop you from falling as fast from lev, and try and run as far as possible, you won't be getting back up any time soon. <br>
<br>
There ya go, found some great tips on CoM in this post. Tomorrow the raid will be lead by one of two people, Torturedone ( 60 Monk ) and or Pyrisus ( 58 Warrior ). The most important thing you can do is to LISTEN to these guys and do EXACTLY what they say. Most of you have been on raid type situiations, but if you haven't before this is the most IMPORTANT thing you can do, even if you dont cast one spell, if you do what you are told to do you will have been a great asset!! <br>
Second most important thing for this zone is DO NOT WANDER. If you wander from where everyone is sitting you WILL DIE. <br>
Third to most important thing DO NOT CAST on anything but what the Master Assist ( MA ) has his target on. If you cast on something that walks in front of you, it may be a lag &quot;ghost&quot; that will pull the entire zone to you and the party.. wiping out the raid.<br>
Fourth most important thing is TO HAVE FUN, this is a learning experience for all of us!!<br>
Once we are done with Neh'Ashiir we can move back down to the relative safty of the castle bridge. There we can pull the castle and kill the lord, Black Reavers and other stuff for as long as we wish, to catch up on the Jade Reavers we missed, and pick up the 3 books required for the Shaman Epic if anyone has not already.<br>
This was a long post but I hope you find it helpful. Preparation is a must!<br>
<br>
See ya'll tomorrow!<br>
