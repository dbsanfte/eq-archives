Sitting on the dock in North Ro waiting on the boat to Velious, Harte cursed the heat of desert and longed for the cold of the continent ahead.<br>
<br>
Harte was concerned.  Norrath had been at peace these many long months with only the natural evils to combat.  His guild's path had been shining brightly and their many achievements had inspired many adventurers to admit that they carried the stones in their heart.  Good-will, celebration and riches had blessed not only his guild, but many others as well.  These were grand days across Norrath.<br>
<br>
Hungry, Harte nibbled on some carrots that he had foraged earlier, as he thought of the event that might change this peaceful world.  It seemed that one mighty guild of adventurers had again slighted an equally strong alliance of guilds.  The peace, understanding and structure that led to peace across Norrath was again threatened by this action.  Could this be the beginning of the foretold &quot;Days of Plunder&quot;?<br>
<br>
As the gnome called out that the boat approached, Harte thought of his many friends who were members of this guild thumbing their noses at the community around them.  The officers didn't consider the friendships their members had outside the guild, only of the riches that they could steal.  Not riches they couldn't get anyway, over time, riches they felt they must have right then.  Harte was concerned, for the most rewarding thing in Norrath were the friendships nurtured over many ages.  He wondered and worried whether he'd ever be able to adventure with these friends again and felt again the sorrow over old dear friends lost to similar actions in the past.<br>
<br>
As he boarded the boat, he paused.  Listening to the silence of the vast desert, he wondered how long that peaceful quiet would last.  Muttering under his breath, he stepped onto the boat, <br>
<br>
&quot;Will they never learn?&quot; <p>Harte Greyeagle<BR>

<br>
Harte stuttered for a moment trying to place a name to the face, but a horned mask covered the identity.  Slightly chuckling to himself Malignus reached back, unstrapped the mask and let his scarred face reveal itself to the sun.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, I still can't place a name to you stranger...&quot; Harte muttered.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't expect you to, it's been a long time but my memory stays intact.  Much unlike my body...&quot; he replied holding up his left hand and revealing several missing fingers.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is your name traveller?  And your destination?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll let you place the name later, it shall excercise your memory.  My destination is the wild lands of Kunark.  I have yet to leave our continent of Antonica and the itch to travel has arrived under my skin.&quot; <br>
<br>
The boat began to sail towards the open sea and the two travellers lounged into comfort for the long ride.  A long silence was shared before the squaking of sea birds broke it.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you still run that little tavern by Kithicor Harte?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me?  How do you know so much about me?  Do I actually have a biographer?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a questionable man when it comes to strangers dear Harte, you should learn to be more trusting!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To trust a Teir'Dal is to pluck a knife from your back my darkened friend, how can you expect me to openly embrace a friendship with a race so full of hate?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then why shall I become more trusting?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Another question...tsk tsk.  I'm hungry and I think I could use a swim.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Diving over the edge of the boat the dark elf began a quick swim beside the sailing boat with his face under the water.  After several more minutes he resurfaced for air, plunged back down but disappeared completely.  Several more minutes later he burst from the waters surface and flopped his upper body onto the raft.  Flopping in his mouth was a small fish.<br>
<br>
&quot;Impressive!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not too hard when there's schools of them swimming down there&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're an interesting elf...um...what shall I call you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll remember soon enough&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Last time I heard that I slit the dwarves throat...please don't anger me...I hate dwarves&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I apologize&quot;<br>
<br>
Malignus pulled the rest of his body out of the water and began feasting on his catch as it squirmed in his hands.  Turning away at the disturbing set of manners Harte gazed at the setting sun and the large mass of land that slowly disappeared to the horizon.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showMessage?topicID=547.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showMessage?topicID=539.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=545.topic&index=1><img src=http://turkkurt.homestead.com/files/z/Sasi/brmreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.threadControl?topicID=545.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=545.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=545.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themissednotethetavern">The Tavern<option value="themissednotethestage">The Stage<option value="themissednotetidbits">Tidbits<option value="themissednotetantrums">Tantrums  <option value="themissednotefrm11">Just for fun!<option value="themissednoteguildlinks">Links<option value="themissednotethepartyforum">The Party Forum<option value="themissednotetradesevents">Trades & Events<option value="themissednotetesting">Testing<option value="themissednotefrm12">Ghost thread</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
