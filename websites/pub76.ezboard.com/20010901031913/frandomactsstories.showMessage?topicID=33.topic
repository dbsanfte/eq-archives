I heard of him through Gaffan -- great experience, he said, fast spawn, easy to deal with.<br>
<br>
I got Mr. Hermit's location and headed out to SK.  After some looking (I'm not very good at directions!), I found the hut at the edge of the South Karana plain.  The hut itself is surrounded by a stone wall.  Once inside the wall, I clicked on the door of the hut.  Nothing happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Open Sesame!&quot; I said.  Nothing happened.  I clicked some more.  Feeling kind of silly, I told Gaffan, &quot;Hey, I can't get in!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, his door's locked,&quot; Gaffan replied.  &quot;You have to turn into a tree right next to it, then click off the treeform spell as you walk forward.&quot;<br>
<br>
I quickly memorized Treeform and cast it on myself, then clicked it off as I hit the up arrow.  I saw the hermit for a second, but still couldn't get in.  I tried several more times with the same results, then decided to try another spot -- near Mr. Hermit's chimney.  It still didn't work.  Sighing heavily, I tried to walk backward -- but I couldn't!  Then I tried forward -- nothing.  Oh great, I thought, I'll have to gate.  I tried to sit down -- oh fantastic, I couldn't sit down.  I tried to cast a spell, any spell -- &quot;You must be standing to cast a spell.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was stuck.<br>
<br>
I tried logging out, thinking I'd pop on the roof -- but no, I was still inside the chimney!  Oh brother!  At last I petitioned, and Dimmy the Dimwitted came to my rescue, summoning me from a few feet away.  Phew!  Boy, did I feel silly, especially when Ashlanne showed up to talk to Dimmy.<br>
<br>
Eventually I got in, but by that time I felt sorry for Mr. Hermit there all by himself -- he conned warmly to me and I decided to just go back to Kelethin and brew instead.<br>
<br>
Understandably, I didn't feel like trying to kill the hermit for a few days.  But last night, I thought Oh, why not.  When I got to the hut, I saw a Barbarian Shaman.  She had been killing the hermit for a while, but her friend had gone linkdead, so I offered to help.  We killed him a couple of times.  He's a tough little bugger, but I didn't die thanks to her help.<br>
<br>
Then she had to leave, so I sat around waiting for Oumaggar to show up.  I got bored.  I decided to try the tree thing again.  Hey, I made it inside!  I walked around a little bit, looking for interesting stuff.  The hermit ignored me.  Then Oumaggar finally arrived, and I realized, oh no!  I couldn't get out!<br>
<br>
&quot;It's OK Gwion,&quot; he said, &quot;Click on me and we'll group, and I'll just kill him from out here and you heal me.&quot;  I managed to click on Oum through a crack in the door, and the plan worked great!  Oum smashed and bashed Mr. Hermit with his big gnarly ogre weapons, and I healed and cast DOT spells.<br>
<br>
We'd killed him four or five times when suddenly I noticed someone was healing the hermit.  A Sentry!  Oh great.  He kept healing the hermit as long as Oum bashed, but if Oum let up for even a second the sentry would start hitting him for 40 or 50 damage.  I tried to gate, but every time I started to cast, Mr. Sentry would run through the door and bash me until I stopped trying.<br>
<br>
At last I managed to get the Gate spell off -- just as Mr. Sentry dealt the crippling blow!  It figures.  I teleported back from my bind point in Kunark, afraid I'd have to get inside the hut again to get my corpse.  Fortunately, I was able to summon it from outside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look at it this way,&quot; said the always-cheerful Oumaggar, &quot;At least you aren't stuck inside the hut anymore.&quot; <p>Gwion Llewellyn<BR> Level, um, 21 <BR> Convicted Drive-by Newbie Levitator<BR>And Norrathian Cruise Director</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/brandomacts.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=finrael>Finrael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#006400>(10/7/00 1:22:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How NOT to kill the Hermit in South Karana</span><hr size=1> Good story, Gwi.
