It's been a few, long weeks, since I last wrote in you.  I'm sorry I was so upset last time.  I hope you're not mad at me diary.  In order to repay you for the kindness of listening to this little girl, I bought for you some colors.  I cannot sketch like Recartia could, but I thought maybe I could try a few illuminations in your pages.<br>
<br>
Recartia... cousin Valanthe... Aluminium... The Tor.  I have not seen them in such a long time.  What an odd troupe we were.  I hope they are all okay.  I hope they forgave me for wandering out on my own.  Tunare, please let them be okay.   Please keep Valanthe from being too Heroic, or Recartia from being to clever.<br>
<br>
It's been hard to do anything lately.  I keep thinking about Mother, and it makes me depressed and lonely.  So... I thought maybe if I force myself to get out, it'll be good for my broken heart.  I am sorry Mother.  I am so sorry for being such a horrid, insolent, little girl.  I... I came home to appologize.  Maybe... maybe you can read these words and fine me worthy of your forgiveness.<br>
<br>
After returning home, I just kinda wandered West in a daze.  By the time I realized it, I was at the Freeport Docks.  I thought, maybe if I see the Marrite Cathedral, it'll rekindle the fires in me that seem to have guttered and died.  It's such an awesome building!  All alabaster marble worked by hand.  A living tribute to the Angel of Love, and a worthy place to worship Her blessings.  But... trouble brew.<br>
<br>
As you know, diary, Donnalinna is a wanted criminal in Freeport.  There is even a warrent out for my arrest.  ME!  A criminal!  I sided with the Marrites, because they're cause is just, and the Militia is no more than badged thugs!  Still... these thugs own two-thirds of the city.  Diary, when I arrived in Freeport in my dazed state, I was not thinking clearly.  I just wandered into the city.<br>
<br>
I think, perhaps, since I don't look as immaculate as I normally do, that... that maybe my dishelved appearance made me look more like a merchant whose lively hood was taken in the recent troubles, and the Militia did not see me.  But... But that did not last, diary.  In West Freeport, a guard shouted at me to stop.  Only by the All-Mother's blessing, did I awake from my dazed and confused stuppor to realize that several of the guards were running at me... with steel drawn.<br>
<br>
As quickly as I could I ran for North Freeport, where the Knights still held jurisdiction.  At the road up, I met Sir Xelios on patrol, who saw me running frightened.  He quickly intercepted me, and asked what's the  matter.  To which I couldn't respond, Diary, I was so out of breath and scared silent.  I had made it.  The Militia would not dare to touch me here.<br>
<br>
But I.. I was mistaken, diary.  Several of the Militia had followed me to the road, and saw me with Sir Xelious.  And they ordered Sir Xelious to surrender me to the Militia, as they had a warrent for my arrest.  Sir Xelious did not.  And... it became a standoff.  The Militia outnumbered the Knight some 4 to 1... but they knew that this area was unfriendly to them.  For several minutes, no one moved diary.  The Militia stood with swords drawn, but did not advance.  Sir Xelious did not draw his weapon, and just stood in front me of, sheilding me.<br>
<br>
I didn't mean for this to happen.  An open scuffle in the streets of Freeport would mean open civil-war in the Freeport lands.  And there we stood, on the verge of civil-war.  At last, the Militia released me under arrest by the Knights.  Sir Xelious waited for the Militia to leave, and then continued on his work as well.<br>
<br>
It seems that everywhere I go, I'm causing trouble, diary.  I didn't want to trouble the Marrites anymore with my bad luck.  So... I continued West.<br>
<br>
The Erudian's have an interesting forrest.  It's unlike any I've ever seen.  It's noisy, hot, dark, dense, moist, and green.  So green it's hypnotyzing.  Maybe... maybe I should go back to Erudin.  Perhaps those learned clerics of the Angels of the Sea, could lend some wisdom to this poor cleric.  Perhaps... perhaps I should keep busy in Erudin.  It's as far away from home as I could get.<br>
<br>
But... but I don't want to leave Felwithe.  It's where I grew up.  It's my home.  It's where the All-Mother bestowed Her gifts upon me, and gave me the charge to serve!  It's my home!  I am no exile, no criminal who should run from the past!<br>
<br>
I am Donnalinna Swansbeauty!  Thane of Misty Thicket!  Elderling Crown Princess, and heir to the Throne of Swans!  The High Council of Felwithe be DAMNED!  I will return home!  I will take my rightful place on the throne!  Mother would not have her daughter cowering in fear and depression!  Mother did not bestow upon me the virtues of duty, nobility, pride, and charisma!  Donnalinna Swansbeauty is a dutiful, and proper daughter.  Donnalinna will honor her Mother, by returning home, and showing those short-sighted Council Seats her true colors! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ukellaheartsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kella Heartsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b> RA Member (Kyrstellaine)</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/01 5:41:54 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Keeping Idle Hands Busy</span><hr size=1> /semi-ooc  You go girl!<br>

My lady, as another member of our guild has said, you will always be a Princess to us, regardless of what the council may say.  I'm glad to hear that you are not going to allow them to keep you down.<br>
<br>
Felwithe will always be home to me, too, but there are so many people in our world who need to learn of the Mother's love.  I found myself unable to sit at home when there was so much to be done.<br>
<br>
/ooc Just wait, I'm going to have to come up with a history for Kyrstel yet!   <p><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color="007fee"><font size=4>Kyrstellaine</FONT><br><font color="ffffff">

<br>
Since you are well known to have a just and fair heart I hope that you will have pitty with the High Council of Felwith since they do not know all of the truth. I am afraid that they do not understand your calling, but I am confident that one day they will see the error in the way they have been treating you and will restore you into your rightful place. Until that day I assure you again that I will consider you the Crown Princess nevertheless. I am glad that you share your struggles so that I can tell the tales of your brave adventures at camp fires and courts.<br>
<br>
