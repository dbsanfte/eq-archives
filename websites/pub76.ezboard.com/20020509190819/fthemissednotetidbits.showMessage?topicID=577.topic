I knew at the <br>time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived, so let me tell you right up front that he's fine. <br><br>Getting him out wasn't easy, though, and the process <br>included numerous home remedies, a plumber, two cops, an <br>emergency overnight veterinary clinic, a case of mistaken <br>identity, five hours of panic, and fifteen minutes of fame. <br><br>First, some background. My husband, Rich, and I had just <br>returned from a five-day spring-break vacation in the Cayman <br>Islands, where I had been sick as a dog the whole time, <br>trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy, it <br>was better to do it in paradise. We had arrived home at 9 <br>p.m., a day and a half later than we had planned because of <br>airline problems. I still had illness-related vertigo, and <br>because of the flight delays, had not been able to prepare <br>the class I was supposed to teach at 8:40 the next morning. <br>I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos <br>Williams, and around ten o'clock I heard Rich hollering <br>something undecipherable from the kitchen. <br><br>As I raced out to see what was wrong, I saw Rich frantically <br>rooting around under the kitchen sink and Rudy, or rather, <br>Rudy's headless body scrambling around in the sink, his <br>claws clicking in panic on the metal. Rich had just ground <br>up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal, <br>and when he left the room, Rudy (whom we always did call a <br>pinhead) had gone in after it. <br><br>It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat <br>in the sink. This is an animal that I have slept with <br>nightly for ten years, who burrows under the covers and <br>purrs against my side, and who now looked like a desperate, <br>fur-covered turkey carcass, set to defrost in the sink while <br>it's still alive and kicking. It was also disturbing to see <br>Rich, Mr. Calm-in-an-Emergency, at his wit's end, trying to <br>soothe Rudy, trying to undo the garbage disposal, failing at <br>both, and basically freaking out. Adding to the chaos was <br>Rudy's twin brother Lowell, also upset, racing around in <br>circles, jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately <br>licking Rudy's butt for comfort and biting it out of fear. <br>Clearly, I had to do something. <br><br>First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by <br>lubricating his head and neck. We tried Johnson's Baby <br>Shampoo (kept on hand for my nieces' visits) and <br>butter-flavored Crisco: both failed, and a now-greasy Rudy <br>kept struggling. <br><br>Rich then decided to take apart the garbage disposal, which <br>was a good idea, but he couldn't do it. Turns out, the thing <br>is constructed like a metal onion: you peel off one layer <br>and another one appears, with Rudy's head still buried deep <br>inside, stuck in a hard plastic collar. My job during this <br>process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy, <br>trying to calm him, with the room spinning (vertigo), Lowell <br>howling (he's part Siamese), and Rich clattering around with <br>tools. When all our efforts failed, we sought professional <br>help. I called our regular plumber, who actually called me <br>back quickly, even at 11 o'clock at night (thanks, Dave). <br>He talked Rich through further layers of disposal <br>dismantling, but still we couldn't reach Rudy. I called the <br>1-800 number for Insinkerator (no response), a pest removal <br>service that advertises 24-hour service (no response), an <br>all-night emergency veterinary clinic (who had no experience <br>in this matter, and so, no advice), and finally, in <br>desperation, 911. I could see that Rudy's normally pink paw <br>pads were turning blue. The fire department, I figured, <br>gets cats out of trees; maybe they could get one out of a <br>garbage disposal. <br><br>The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two <br>policemen. This suggestion gave me pause. I'm from the <br>sixties, and even if I am currently a fine upstanding <br>citizen, I had never considered calling the cops and asking <br>them to come to my house, on purpose. I resisted the <br>suggestion, but the dispatcher was adamant: &quot;They'll help <br>you out,&quot; he said. <br><br>The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be <br>quite nice. More importantly, they were also able to think <br>rationally, which we were not. They were, of course, quite <br>astonished by the situation: &quot;I've never seen anything like <br>this,&quot; Officer Mike kept saying. (The unusual circumstances <br>helped us get quickly on a first-name basis with our cops.) <br>Officer Tom expressed immediate sympathy for our plight. &quot;I <br>have had cats all my life,&quot; he said, comfortingly. Also he <br>had an idea. Evidently we needed a certain tool, a tiny, <br>circular rotating saw that could cut through the heavy <br>plastic flange encircling Rudy's neck without hurting Rudy, <br>and Officer Tom happened to own one. &quot;I live just five <br>minutes from here,&quot; he said; &quot;I'll go get it.&quot; <br><br>He soon returned, and the three of them, Rich and the two <br>policemen got under the sink together to cut through the <br>garbage disposal. I sat on the counter, holding Rudy and <br>trying not to succumb to the surreal-ness of the scene, with <br>the weird middle-of-the-night lighting, the room's <br>occasional spinning, Lowell's spooky sound effects, an <br>apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs <br>poking out from under it. One good thing came of this: the <br>guys did manage to get the bottom off the disposal, so we <br>could now see Rudy's face and knew he could breathe. But <br>they couldn't cut the flange without risking the cat. <br><br>Stumped, Officer Tom had another idea. &quot;You know,&quot; he said, <br>&quot;I think the reason we can't get him out is the angle of his <br>head and body. If we could just get the sink out and lay it <br>on its side, I'll bet we could slip him out.&quot; That sounded <br>like a good idea at this point, ANYTHING would have sounded <br>like a good idea and as it turned out, Officer Mike runs a <br>plumbing business on weekends; he knew how to take out the <br>sink! Again they went to work, the three pairs of legs <br>sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an <br>ever-increasing pile of tools and sink parts. They cut the <br>electrical supply, capped off the plumbing lines, unfastened <br>the metal clamps, unscrewed all the pipes, and about an hour <br>later, voila! The sink was lifted gently out of the <br>countertop, with one guy holding the garbage disposal (which <br>contained Rudy's head) up close to the sink (which contained <br>Rudy's body). We laid the sink on its side, but even at <br>this more favorable removal angle, Rudy stayed stuck. <br><br>Officer Tom's radio beeped, calling him away on some kind of <br>real police business. As he was leaving, though, he had <br>another good idea: &quot;You know,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't think we <br>can get him out while he's struggling so much. We need to <br>get the cat sedated. If he were limp, we could slide him <br>out.&quot; And off he went, regretfully, a cat lover still <br>worried about Rudy. <br><br>The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated <br>was a good idea, but Rich and I were new to the area. We <br>knew that the overnight emergency veterinary clinic was only <br>a few minutes away, but we didn't know exactly how to get <br>there. &quot;I know where it is!&quot; declared Officer Mike. <br>&quot;Follow me!&quot; So Mike got into his patrol car, Rich got into the <br>driver's seat of our car, and I got into the back, carrying <br>the kitchen sink, what was left of the garbage disposal, and <br>Rudy. <br><br>It was now about 2:00 a.m. We followed Officer Mike for a <br>few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the garbage <br>disposal to pet Rudy's face, hoping I could comfort him. <br>Instead, my sweet, gentle bedfellow chomped down on my <br>finger, hard, really hard and wouldn't let go. My scream <br>reflex kicked into gear, and I couldn't stop the noise. <br>Rich slammed on the breaks, hollering &quot;What? What happened? <br>Should I stop?&quot; checking us out in the rear view mirror. <br>&quot;No,&quot; I managed to get out between screams, &quot;just keep <br>driving. Rudy's biting me, but we've got to get to the <br>vet. Just go!&quot; <br><br>Rich turned his attention back to the road, where Officer <br>Mike took a turn we hadn't expected, and we followed. After <br>a few minutes Rudy let go, and as I stopped screaming, I <br>looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly <br>through an industrial park, in and out of empty parking <br>lots, past little streets that didn't look at all familiar. <br><br>&quot;Where's he taking us?&quot; I asked. &quot;We should have been <br>there <br>ten minutes ago!&quot; Rich was as mystified as I was, but all we <br>knew to do was follow the police car until, finally, he <br>pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next to <br>him. As Rich rolled down the window to ask, Mike, &quot;where <br>are we going?&quot; The cop, who was not Mike, rolled down his <br>window and asked, &quot;Why are you following me?&quot; Once Rich and <br>I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop <br>car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked, led <br>us quickly to the emergency vet, where Mike greeted us by <br>holding open the door, exclaiming, &quot; Where were you guys???&quot; <br><br>It was lucky that Mike got to the vets ahead of us, because <br>we hadn't thought to call and warn them about what was <br>coming. (Clearly, by this time we weren't really thinking at <br>all.) We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and the <br>garbage disposal containing his head, and the clinic staff <br>was ready. They took his temperature (which was down <br>10-degrees) and his oxygen level (which was half of normal), <br>and the vet declared: &quot;This cat is in serious shock. We've <br>got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately.&quot; <br>When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock, the vet <br>said grimly, &quot;We don't have a choice.&quot; With that, he <br>injected the cat; Rudy went limp; and the vet squeezed about <br>half a tube of K-Y jelly onto the cat's neck and pulled him <br>free. <br><br>Then the whole team jumped into code blue mode. (I know this <br>from watching a lot of &quot;ER.&quot;) They laid Rudy on a cart, where <br>one person hooked up IV fluids, another put little socks on <br>his paws (&quot;You'd be amazed how much heat they lose through <br>their pads,&quot; she said), one covered him with hot water <br>bottles and a blanket, and another took a blow-dryer to warm <br>up Rudy's now very gunky head. The fur on his head dried in <br>stiff little spikes, making him look rather pathetically <br>punk as he lay there, limp and motionless. At this point <br>they sent Rich, Mike, and me to sit in the waiting room <br>while they tried to bring Rudy back to life. I told Mike he <br>didn't have to stay, but he just stood there, shaking his <br>head. &quot;I've never seen anything like this,&quot; he said again. <br>At about 3 am, the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis <br>was good for a full recovery. They needed to keep Rudy <br>overnight to re-hydrate him and give him something for the <br>brain swelling they assumed he had, but if all went well, we <br>could take him home the following night. Just in time to <br>hear the good news, Officer Tom rushed in, finished with his <br>real police work and concerned about Rudy. I figured that <br>once this ordeal was over and Rudy was home safely, I would <br>have to re-think my position on the police. <br><br>Rich and I got back home about 3:30. We hadn't unpacked from <br>our trip, I was still intermittently dizzy, and I still <br>hadn't prepared my 8:40 class. &quot;I need a vacation,&quot; I said, <br>and while I called the office to leave a message canceling <br>my class, Rich made us a pitcher of martinis. I slept late <br>the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudy's <br>condition until he said that Rudy could come home later that <br>day. I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang. <br>&quot;Hi, this is Steve Huskey from the Norristown Times-Herald,&quot; <br>a voice told me. &quot;Listen, I was just going through the <br>police blotter from last night. Mostly it's the usual <br>stuff: breaking and entering, petty theft but there's this <br>one item. Um, do you have a cat?&quot; So I told Steve the whole <br>story, which interested him. A couple hours later he called <br>back to say that his editor was interested, too; did I have <br>a picture of Rudy? The next day Rudy was front-page news, <br>under the ridiculous headline Catch of the Day Lands Cat in <br>Hot Water. <br><br>There were some noteworthy repercussions to the <br>newspaper article. Mr. Huskey had somehow inferred that I <br>called 911 because I thought Rich, my husband, was going <br>into shock, although how he concluded this from my comment <br>that his pads were turning blue, I don't quite understand. <br>So the first thing I had to do was call Rich at work. Rich <br>(who had worked tirelessly to free Rudy)and swear that I had <br>been misquoted. When I arrived at work myself, I was famous; <br>people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire <br>about Rudy's health. When I called our regular vet (whom I <br>had met only once) to make a follow-up appointment for Rudy, <br>the receptionist asked, &quot;Is this the famous Rudy's mother?&quot; <br>When I brought my car in for routine maintenance a few days <br>later, Dave, my mechanic, said, &quot;We read about your cat. Is <br>he OK?&quot; When I called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak, <br>he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat had <br>been in the garbage disposal. And when I went to get my hair <br>cut, the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma <br>had read in the paper, about a cat that got stuck in the <br>garbage disposal. Even today, over a year later, people ask <br>about Rudy, whom a 9-year-old neighbor had always called the <br>&quot;Adventure Cat&quot; because he used to climb on the roof of her <br>house and peer in the second-story window at her. <br><br>I don't know what the moral of this story is, but I do know <br>that this adventure cost me $1100 in emergency vet bills, <br>follow-up vet care, new sink, new plumbing, new electrical <br>wiring, and new garbage disposal, one with a cover. The vet <br>can no longer say he's seen everything but the kitchen sink. <br>I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift <br>certificates to the local hardware store, but was told that <br>they couldn't accept gifts, that I would put them in a bad <br>position if I tried. So I wrote a letter to the Police Chief <br>praising their good deeds and sent individual thank-you <br>notes to Tom and Mike, complete with pictures of Rudy, so <br>they could see what he looks like with his head on. And <br>Rudy, whom we originally got for free (or so we thought), <br>still sleeps with me under the covers on cold nights and <br>unaccountably, he still sometimes prowls the sink, hoping <br>for fish. <br><br> <p><p><br><br><br><br><center><font face="lucida handwriting" size=5 font color="FF0000">Sasi<br>Have you hugged your troll today?</font></center></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Dorf Extraordinaire</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/26/02 11:39:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=577.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Dorraxx4.jpg width=170 height=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cute as hell story!  </span><hr size=1> Hehe, Sasi that was great. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Thanks for the smile. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showPrevMessage?topicID=577.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showNextMessage?topicID=577.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=577.topic&index=1><img src=http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/Reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.threadControl?topicID=577.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=577.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=577.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themissednotefrm15">SEE the Missed Note<option value="themissednotethetavern">The Tavern<option value="themissednotethestage">The Stage<option value="themissednotetidbits">Tidbits<option value="themissednotetantrums">Tantrums  <option value="themissednotefrm11">Just for fun!<option value="themissednoteguildlinks">Links<option value="themissednotethepartyforum">The Party Forum<option value="themissednotetradesevents">Trades & Events<option value="themissednotetesting">Testing<option value="themissednotefrm12">Ghost thread</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits>Tidbits</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
