<br>
Well hopefully I, as Donnalinna's avitar in the Real World, have peaked your interest enough in Donnalinna to try to figure  her out.  Well... this essay isn't really about Donnalinna; it's more an effort to give some thoughts and tips on role-playing, and how I came about with the idea of Donnalinna.  As well as some relation of these aspects to role-playing.  Do forgive, as with many of my essay's, I have a very indirect way of getting from point a to point b.  And, this might be kinda longish too.<br>
<br>
Well, if you didn't know already, I'm a guy.  Yes, a guy plays girly Donnalinna.  Now, for all you ladies out there (and it's eiree... I seem to know more female EQers than guys... but anyway), if I might ask a question, is Donnalinna a girl to you?  It makes me really giddy when people complement me on how  much of a personality and how 3-D Donnalinna is... and it's even more giddy when a girl or lady originally thought that Donnalinna's avitar was a girl too.  It makes me feel all this effort I put into it was worth it.<br>
<br>
Now, why do I bring this up?  Well, lets get a little background on me first.  Overall... in most of the computer RPGs, and other gaming stuff (pics in rule-books, collectable card-art, movies, bishoujo anime, etc.) to me the girl characters just look cooler.  The costumes, coreography, designs, etc really impressed me.  For example, in the recent movie Atlantis (which is about a 6 on a 1 - 10), the femme fatal Helga I thought was so keen.  Didn't really have much of a personality or character, but I really liked the way she was drawn.  Same goes for the Amazon and Sorceress in Diablo II.  I thought they're character models were tons cooler than the Necromancer and the Paladin's.  Now, this isn't to say that some of the guy characters don't look cool, or have a costuming that I really like (for example, I really liked how Gordon looked in Halflife, and the Beast-Form-Wizard in Gauntlet Legands is really keen); just, overall, I tend to like the way the girls are drawn.  So, extrapolate this to EQ, and you get me picking a female High Elf, because I thought she looked much better rendered.<br>
<br>
Okay now point two, I'm sure other guys play girl characters... but, unfortunatley, it's been my experience that most guys playing girls tend to play the girl as a &quot;sex-pot&quot;... i.e., perfect figure, and just out to see... how many... adult encounters she can have.  So... most women get offended by these characters.  Or, if not offended, at least disappointed.  Seriously, you've seen comic book heroines.  I think they all have the super power to fit those ridiculus figures into those super-tight, spandex costumes.   Anyway, I decided that dammit, I want to play a girl who's a girl.  So... I started thinking about what makes a girl a girl.<br>
<br>
However, I quickly came across a problem.  I'm a boy.  So... where do I get the inspiration on what a girl is like?  And it came to me, from my books.  I have a ton of literature that I own, as well as a ton of shoujo (girl's) anime, to drawn ideas from.  (And other books/stories are excellent places to get ideas on your own charcters personality from.)<br>
<br>
Most of my literature is split about 50-50 between guys stories and girl stories.  So... I started to piece together ideas of how girls act, what they like to do, and how &quot;femininity&quot; works.  Or... at least I tried my best to do so (and I hope that it's been working so far.)  So... Donnalinna likes to do girly things like sew and get dressed up and dance, she gets very flattered when gentlemen callers complement her, although she doesn't fight often, when she does, Hell hath no fury like Donnalinna.  So, hopefully, I made Donnalinna a real girl to you all.<br>
<br>
Now, that gave me some ground level stuff... but not Donnalinna.  So, next I decided that I would have one characterizing event that influances the rest of Donnalinna's upbringing.  Some of you may know it... others most likely not.  You might have ideas, but... overall I think you'd be surprized when you find out what happened in Donnalinna's past.<br>
<br>
Now, if you're curious, which you should be, why do you think Donnalinna is the way she is?  Well... lets look at what info is available right now.<br>
<br>
1) She's an High Elven Crown Princess (with all the pros and con's associated with it; i.e. she's proud, haughty, vainglorious, arrogant, compassionate, tender, merciful, used to getting her way, motherly to her subjects, hot/cold, etc., etc., etc.,  She's a fay princess, duh!  ^_^.)<br>
<br>
2) She's away from home with... dubious permission to have done so.  (She sometimes mentions Felwithe, but only to ask how the city has been... she rarely talks about going home.)<br>
<br>
3) She's a cleric of Tunare (now, couple this with her birth and upbringing, and she sometimes chafes at being a Servant of All.)<br>
<br>
4) She has a brother and a mother.  (If you ever really listen to her, she doesn't mention her father... much.)  Now she loves both her brother and mother... but her eyes do become sad, and her words guarded when she starts talking about them.<br>
<br>
5) She is depressed about something... but hasn't said what to the Congress of the Guild.  (She has hinted at it, but remember, she's of noble blood, and therefore finds it hard to talk about herself in a personal way... especially something so personal to people who she feels aren't her social-rank equals.)<br>
<br>
6) She talks about herself in the third person alot.  (now, possibly surprizing, this is a very important thing... take notice when Donnalinna refeers to herself as &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot;... something very important to her is going on.)<br>
<br>
7) She is very formal when she receives a complement.  In fact... she asks you to stop doing so.  Now... why would someone who is as vain, vain to the point of being vain-glorious, as Donnalinna is ask you to stop complementing her?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  She gets jellous easily... but watch what she gets jellous over.  Perhaps... perhaps it isn't as obvious as it may seem.  (Remember Donnalinna cried at the RA 1 year anniversary because she wasn't part of anyone's stories.  Now, this might be because she's vain, and felt slighted that no one would tell a ballad of her... or perhaps she's... lonely, and was hoping that someone would tell a story of her, so she would feel more welcome.)<br>
<br>
9) She doesn't take the ribbing and joking at her expense well.  Now, this might be because she's a Crown Princess, and used to having no one say ill of her... or maybe it's because of something else why she doesn't like to be teased or made fun of.<br>
<br>
Now, you have some clues.   But... as with any good novel, you don't have a clear picture yet.  However, you should have enough that, if your familiar with how stories are told, you could give some very good guessess as to what happened.<br>
<br>
Curious yet ^_-?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope that helps you understand how I came about with Donnalinna's character, and perhaps curious enough to try to figure out, or directly ask, what happened in Donnalinna's past.  And, to give you ideas on how to give your own characters personalities.  The jist of it, there are a ton of stories out there that we've all read.  Who is to say you couldn't take Don Quixote's goofy-charm, mix in a bit of Sir Lancelot's prestigue and honor, add a dash of Will Scarlet's rougeish ways, and give that as a foundation for a personality.  That's about it.<br>

<br>
I, for one, have always been very interested in Donnalinna from the couple of encounters I've had with her a month or two ago (her respect for bards really piqued my interest). Its so refreshing to see someone put some much effort into RPing their character so well...I was always shocked by the amount of energy and levels of creativity that went into this persona. If I were to create a character for Cefias, I really would have no idea where to begin. He seems to be a projection of my emotions and thoughts...only blown up to a larger size (which generally means he's very wide-eyed and energetic). I could never tear myself away from his personality, which always made RPing such an uncomfortable thing for me. Perhaps I'll create an alt and try to do with them what you have succeeded so greatly in doing with Donnalinna.<br>
<br>
Congratulations again, and thanks for sharing your thoughts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>

OOC...You do a fabulous job of Donnalinna. As a true-to-life female, I was downright dumbfounded <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  when I learned that The Lady was RP'd by a man. I have heard of many men playing women and most admit to doing so because they get great stuff from other males, a fact which bothers me. But you do women a great service with Donnalinna. She is more feminine than I!!<br>
Someone who didn't know Donnalinna once asked me why she referred to herself in the third person. I replied that all royalty do that. It has been my observation that those in Britain almost always seem to refer to themselves in the third person in public. You should be very proud of the job that you do with Donnalinna. You have captured the &quot;female&quot; probably more than some of us RL women do.<br>
I have roleplayed in RL once and was very uncomfortable with it though I did not know the people very well at the time. I play Ally as myself but when I've grouped with Donnalinna, I find myself falling into it and enjoying it.<br>
As for liking the way women are drawn... of course... you're a male and you like women. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Now I'm doing the female thing and going around the point... to sum up... Bravo, fair Lady. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Alluramar Surefriend<br>

Hehe...i had so much trouble with Donna's roleplaying that I had to talk to Donna's avatar OOC.  <br>
<br>
I think it's because I'm a RL female, who doesn't like all this 'girly' 'female' stuff that 'girls' are 'supposed' to be like.  (pardon all the ''s)  I'm a very rough and tumble open sort of girl, and someone looking down on me because i'm not 'behaving properly as a maid should'  &lt;--- donna's words  ;-)   Makes me hopping mad hehe.  I suppose that's why I get along playing Ortaak so well heh....I don't have to put up with all that female sterotyping, and if Ort acts a little gay, well so what?  He's a fun guy  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    A lot of people have been shocked to find out that the guy behind ortaak is a GURL.  So maybe i'm a good roleplayer as well  ;-)  well...umm...maybe i'm just 'manly' or something too.  roflmao.      heh...just a random ramble...don't listen to me...i'm just bored.   <p>Kaishia Fleetheart <BR> lvl 24 Bard 'o Woodelves Elves<BR>Ortaak Thundereyes<BR> lvl 30 Shaman 'o the Barbies <BR>Yassandra <BR> lvl 13 Enchanter of the Teir'dal</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/brandomacts.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=donnalinna>Donnalinna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member<b></span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#006400>(7/10/01 3:01:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A short triest on Role-Playing, and how Donnalinna came to b</span><hr size=1> Hey all,<br>
<br>
ooc well, I have a few moments while I mooch one of my friends internet connections.<br>
<br>
First, thanks.  These are the kinds of things that make me all giddy feeling... when people tell me they are impressed with how I play Donnalinna.  It makes all the work worth it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just a few more things to think about.<br>
<br>
1) ooc as Kaishia said, when Donnalinna was around, I upset her more than I thought I did.  So... if you do RP, please let people know you are, and make sure they're not really mad or upset with you.  I am sorry Kaishia, and I'm glad you took me aside to remind me of this.  And, to anyone else who I have upset unknowingly, I am sorry as well.  I didn't mean to upset you; I was simply trying to stay in character so you all can further immerse  youself in the EQ universe.<br>
<br>
To Kaishia<br>
<br>
ooc well... honestly, what's wrong with a girl being girly?  I'm not saying you're not right being tomboyish (it makes you happy, and it's who you are), but if a girl enjoys doing feminine stuff, that should be okay too.  So... I chose to have Donnalinna be feminine and girly.  She could have just as easily been quiet and reserved, shy, spunky and outgoing, etc., etc., etc.  I just choose girly, as... well without runing Donnalinna's secret for everyone else... it fit best with her past, and what her upbringing would have been.<br>
<br>
To Ally,<br>
<br>
Something else to remember too.  Story-wise, if a girl talks about herself in the third person, she's suppossed to be pure of heart and innocent... or attempting to keep her innocence.  (For example, little girls sometimes talk about themselves in the third person in real-life, its kinda funny-cute sort of thing.)  So... Donnalinna might talk about herself in the third person because she is nobility... and it also might be for another reason too.<br>
<br>
To Legolass<br>
<br>
Oh, you're just jellous that Donnalinna has more of a following than you do ;P  Besides... if you slap her, she might get really indignant with you, and slap you back.<br>
