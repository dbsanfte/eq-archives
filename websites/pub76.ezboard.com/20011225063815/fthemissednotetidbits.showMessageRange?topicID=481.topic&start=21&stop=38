My best definition of life and life after death came from a very old movie... the star (Cary Grant, I think) was on a river boat and he scooped up a pitcher of water.  He said something along the lines of "While the water is in this pitcher, it has a shape and an identity".  Then he poured the pitcher of water back into the river and asked "Where is it now?  The water hasn't disappeared.... but it will never again be in that form".    <p><center><font size=5 font color="FF0000"><i>~~Sasi~~</i></font><BR>The Directionally Challenged Bard<br><br><br><br><center>Join the fun at<br><a href=http://server6.ezboard.com/bthemissednote target="web">The Missed Note</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvandaal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vandaal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bachelor de jour</span><br> <font color=#000000>(3/16/01 3:20:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotetidbits.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So Doraxx wants to talk religion...</span><hr size=1> I tend to think that when we are dead, that's it.

I was wrong and should never have painted you with that brush when I barely know you. My anger was fueled by something else. That is a problem I have, I displace my anger, but hey.<br>
<br>
As for how I feel, I dont care for either Bush or Gore, both come from political families and were bred for this. I dont feel they have the nations best inrest at heart. I also feel the head of the GoP and DNC has more power then the current president. <br>
<br>
I dont like our current system, it is a two party system and limits new thought.<br>
<br>
I think serving in the national guard is honorable, even is all he did was play with big planes in texas.<br>
<br>
I think Gore was a joke, he wasnt in the military persay, he was a military journalist, and had four bodyguards with him at all times, and had at least 20 people full time coordinating where he went in vietnam to protect him. So he didnt really do anything spectatular, but hey, it looks good on yer record that you are a vet.<br>
<br>
I feel that a president who can command the entire military force at the whim of hand should be understand who s/he is sending into combat and why. I dont like certain sec. of states who believe the military is just a threat and you should moblilize them anytime ya need to make a political advancement.<br>
<br>
I feel that alot of good lives have been wasted in military service and I also believe that military service abnormally effects the families of those serving as well as the servicemen and women.<br>
<br>
I feel the feudal system makes sense because, instead of land, which was valuable back then, now it is just cash, in that system he who has the cash has the power. So it is those with cash acting as lords and those who must feed and return to the system serving underneath them, never advancing without alot of luck or perserverance.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
One thing I have learned though is you dont talk politics, religion, or sex in certain situations and I should of left well enough alone. <br>
<br>
But if we are doing religion, hey okay, I dont believe in organized religions, I am a roman catholic, but what does that mean? hmmm, does God even know what Catholic means, does he even care? I personally feel my God only loves me and lets me live my life mistakes and all. I also see God not in church, but in nature, in women, in art, in most anything, I am amazed at the beauty of the world and stunned that it exists in such harmony.  <br>
<br>
I dont know. I do know I dont like abortation, but I do know I have take two close friends to the womens clinic to have them done and I held them as they cryed and felt scarred and ashamed, I may not like it, but why would I support them in it, I dont know maybe I am hypocrite, perhaps, that is something that burns me, but I know that I am glad I was there for them.<br>
<br>

I know you've been struggling with something lately, so please, don't sweat it.  We can talk politics all day, I'm fine with that.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, after reading your last post, I think you and I have very similar political views.  I don't know how old you are, but you can't be much older or younger than I am (31).  I know for certain that most of my friends are totally disillusioned by the political process.  Most of them don't even vote, even though they tend to be a bit more knowledgeable about world issues than most people I meet.  Bottom line, I think we'll start to see things change in our lifetime, as the reins get handed over from our parents to us.  Scary thought, at times, but what can you do?  Strom Thurmond can't live forever!<br>
<br>
I think what I see in our political process, especially on a state level, is popular propositions get passed (Prop 214, Prop 187), and then get held up in court and eventually shot down.  That is not democracy.  It's sick.  &quot;Socially conscious lawyer&quot; must be the biggest oxymoron ever, which is odd, because I know some lawyers and they are good people.<br>
<br>
Radgen, add me to the list too.  Was raised Catholic, now have innate (and I think justified) distrust of organized religion.  I would say they are the most evil organizations the world has ever known, but they do some good works too.  Too bad it doesn't balance, IMHO.<br>
<br>
Anyway...everyone, have a great weekend, I'm gonna go buy Baldur's Gate 2 and see what all the hoopla is all about.<br>
<br>
I won't badger you about Iksar pr0n anymore DM, but please...<br>

Bush has at least the next 4 years to make it happen.  He's off to a controversial start, but after the last 6 years of Clinton, it doesn't surprise me that the demos are out for blood.  As a skeptic, I'm concerned.  As an American, I'm hopeful. <p>Vandaal Steelthorn <BR>
