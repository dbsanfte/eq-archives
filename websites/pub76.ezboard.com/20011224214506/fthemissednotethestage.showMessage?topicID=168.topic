After a quick inspection of the shop she began making preparations to open for business. Before revealing himself, Virago D'Mort studied Tislan. This was his first mission and his first contact with the world outside the city of Neriak and Nektulos Forest. Freeport was a bewildering city, some of it grand, much of it poor and completely filled with humans, halflings, high elves and even traitors. All of them heathens or, worse, heretics.<br>
<br><br>
Virago's mother was Noxhil V'Sek's maid and lover. Both by necessity, neither by choice. Noxhil was a Master in the Lodge of the Dead, a position of some importance and most importantly he was a Shadow Lord. On one of his visits with Virago's mother he noticed young Virago channeling. Virago had stumbled upon Harm Touch, only one out of twenty Teir'Dal had the ability inborn, and this peeked Noxhil's interest and he kept his eye on the child. Years later Noxhil happened upon Virago practicing forms with his sword and several friends. He was taking on two of his friends at a time, one a star pupil of Noxhil's, and he was besting them. The next morning, two apprentices from the Shadow Lord appeared on Virago's doorstep with a letter from the Lodge, as it was popularly called:<br>
<br><br>
You are summoned to the Lodge of Dead to serve Innoruk and your people.<br>
<br><br>
Ulraz S'Lon<br>
<br><br>
The letter was always the same, simply for the benefit of the family. Something to frame, display and honor. More times than not, the apprentices who delivered such letters were sent to separate mother from child as well as to escort the new recruit. Virago's mother did not put up any fuss. She hugged her son passionately with tears in her eyes and wispered her love for him and bade him to honor her. In hindsight, Virago knew she must have been aware of his candancy. Noxhil may have warned her or she over-heard the news while doing his housekeeping.<br>
<br><br>
Virago was only to introduce himself to Tislan and let her know she would be receiving instructions from him in the future. She was one of the best informants the Lodge had. She was a spy for the Alliance as well as the Teir'Dal, only her allegiance was with the followers of Innoruk. So she said. Her information had always been good and nothing had linked her to any failures. On the contrary, her information led to the victory in Kithicor Forest, and she was granted respect no human had otherwise attained in the Lodge.<br>
<br><br>
Before Virago could reveal himself a beautiful enchantress entered the shop. She had beautiful soft skin, flowing red hair and deep black eyes.<br>
<br><br>
"Hello Margaux and good morning, any news from the front?" Tislan started. "No news, just a friendly visit Tislan. You should be more guarded in your speech." Margaux answered. "Yes, mistress. You're always right" responded Tislan.<br>
<br><br>
Margaux went on, "I do need some news on the Freeport Militia though, they seem to be up to their usual plots. We don't need them stirring up trouble right now, not with the offensive being put together to close the portal in Kithicor." Tislan replied, "I'll get working on it. As you know, I have some reliable informants in the Militia house, one is real cute too." They both chuckled over this. Tislan offered Margaux some tea, thankfully, Margaux declined and left. As Tislan turned from closing the door behind Margaux, Virago revealed himself. He placed himself in front of her before revealing himself, but he did not get the effect he was hoping for. She laughed at him, she couldn't stop for a couple minutes in fact.<br>
<br><br>
She finally got a hold of herself and asked, "Why do the new recruits always try impress me with their ability in Hiding?" She shook her head, in a transparent attempt to keep from laughing. "I suppose you're here to let me know you will be supplying me with instructions in the future. Ha! you didn't know there have been others, I can tell by your face. You are a sweet looking one though." She looked him up and down appreciatively. He had been warned about her tastes and allowed to indulge her if he wanted. Finally he responded to her with a couple nodes. "Oh, a quiet one, just as a man should be", she laughed.<br>
<br><br>
"Who is this Margaux that was just here?" asked Virago. Tislan responded, "I'm sure you were told not to ask questions nor to answer them. I suggest you keep your instructions. Hmm, you have that look in your eye. She's a big fish and should be handled by a professional, not a youngster like yourself. What is your name, by the way? I'm sure you were supposed to reveal that to me. Or, have I completely put you off? Coming back to himself, he responded, "Virago, Virago D'Mort."  <p>Virago D'Mort
<br>"I am a Shadow Knight. That makes me firm of friendship, unforgiving of faithlessness, and I do not give up. Ever." (Agarwaen)
