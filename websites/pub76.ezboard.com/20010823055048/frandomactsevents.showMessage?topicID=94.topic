Surnaming and anniversary party</span><hr size=1> Hi everyone.  It's almost October -- and two important events are near.  We all read the RL bio thread Pikaa started, right?  If you read closely, you'll know that this Saturday is the first anniversary of the RL marriage of Grimmbaldis Stormwolfe and his lovely wife Bronwynn.<br>
<br>
The second event -- our beloved Bosslady, Hamadryad, is nearing her twentieth season.  In her honor, and Grimm's, and Bronwynn's, I'd like to hold a Surnaming and Anniversary party this Saturday, at 3:00 PM EST (that's two central, one mountain, and noon pacific).<br>
<br>
So come on to the Sandfishers in the Northern Desert of Ro, just off the East Commons and the Western side of Freeport.  Bring your fishing pole! Bring wine! (I'm going to!)  Bring yourself!  Bring your friends and prospective guild pledges!  All are welcome.<br>
<br>
If that's a terrible time, please let me know.  But we haven't gotten together for a while, and if you can make it, we'd love to have you.<br>
<br>

<br>
Ahh, I'm relieved to hear that finally there is an event again. <br>
Last two weeks there was not much going on, no great things like a first aid camp and sadly the scavenger hunt could not be hold as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
All I hear of lately is 'gaining this lvl and hunting there and there'. I'm not excluding me in this issue, I was on a hunt for this 15th lvl as well and I still feel like 20th could be real near if i only whack mobs like hell. But at least at one day per week an event could be held I think, RA would loose an important thing if events like the first aid camp would vanish silently.<br>
<br>
Leldara, Meriel and I had a really nice give-away today in Kelethin. We gathered the newbies at the lift and then asked them questions about various things in Norrath, the prize for the fast answer was a nice piece of banded armor. This was really great and time went by so fast that I was quite shocked when I had a look at my watch, hehe.<br>
<br>
I post some pics from that event in the follow-up...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, hunting with all you people is great as well. I think I'd never find a group as good as one with you guildmates, and that's because we all share the same ideals and really are a big family *hugs you all* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

    Saturdays are bad for me also as i have to make the doughnuts (work) all day .<br>
But don't change things on my account only. If you do change to Sunday however I would be sure to attend. Congratulations to all those being honored: Hama, Bron, and Grimmy.<br>

<br>
Either Sat. or Sun are doable for me, as long as the time of day holds, or there abouts. I guess what's most important is when the honered guests can be there! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Would put a bit of a damper on things if they couldn't attend!<br>
<br>
I'd also like to address a comment that Tevael made about our events. Although Gwion is our Official Event Coordinator, she is not the only member of RA that can hold and host an event. So, to Tevael and others that were thinking that, plan one! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just make sure that Gwion is in the know when you start the ball rolling. <br>
<br>
I, personally, would love to attend each and every event that the guild has, however, RL comes first. That's true for all of us, even Gwion. So if you think something is lacking, like first aid camps, start one up. I'm sure that those of us that CAN make it, WILL make it. <br>
<br>
Okay, that's my rant for now.<br>

<br>
    I'm working at that hour on Saturday, so unfortunately I will not be able to attend.  However, I will be on that night.  Whether or not I'm there, its still a celebration of two  great things.  First, is the RL anniversary of Grimm and Bronywn.  Congrats you two! That's the greatest gift of them all, being able to celebrate the love between you two and more to come.  <br>
    <br>
    I would also like to congratulate Lady Hamadryad for making her 20th season.  We all know that making the 20th season in our EQ lifes is the first major accomplishment (unless you consider reaching that desired spell lvl).  I still can't believe that this day has finally come for your surname, not too long ago, I still remember seeing you face to face in Qeynos Hills.  This was when Random Acts was still not officially (tagged in-game) a guild. Boy, has the time flew by.  <br>
<br>
    Well, again, I'm sorry I can't make it that time.  But, for those who can be in the EQ world, by all means attend this event.  This could very well, be the most important event.  Many reasons that I've not included here.  Until then, I will see you that night.  Take care all.<br>

<br>
I am looking forward to our event(s) this weekend.<br>
I did request both events, but I forgot to tell<br>
Gwion a little background.<br>
<br>
October 2nd is Bronwynn and Grimmbaldis anniversary,<br>
but they can't make it then, and suggested October<br>
1st which is Sunday. I think late afternoon was<br>
better for them.<br>
<br>
Since it turns out more people can make it on<br>
Sunday than on Saturday I request that we change<br>
the event to Sunday at 5 EST...would that work<br>
Gwion? Again, I apologize for not being more<br>
clear about dates and times.<br>
<br>
As for the Surnaming Part, I will come prepared to<br>
give the story of my surname and my history (I<br>
hope I can do it drunk).<br>
<br>
Thank you Jellybean for that wonderful reminder of<br>
when Random Acts was young. That was a fun time for<br>
me going out and telling people about an idea for<br>
a guild based on random acts of kindness. I was<br>
so happy when Jellybean and a few others said <br>
they loved the idea. Ahhhh...the world was new!<br>
<br>
I also want to address the idea of spontaneous<br>
events such as some of you recently held in Faydwer<br>
vs organized events...just my 2 cents that both<br>
kinds are fantastic! In fact, I love the spontaneous<br>
ones in a different way because it surprises people<br>
and makes them happy that other people would do<br>
something really nice for them even if they don't <br>
know them. And there is an anonymity to them because<br>
it's not big and organized and the cameras are<br>
not rolling. I like that.<br>
<br>
Still, it is time we have a big camera rolling<br>
event so I am calling for one for next weekend.<br>
Gwion, I know you are very busy and we can all<br>
pitch in and organize a First Aid Camp for next<br>
weekend and give you a breather...if you want.<br>
I will wait for your answer on that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
