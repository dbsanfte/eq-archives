Gwion scanned the horizon, looking for someone else to levitate.  &quot;They must all have gone over to Blackburrow,&quot; she said to herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, lookit me, I'm flying -- OW!&quot; The young human's levitation spell wore off in mid-jump.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Gwion said, healing the unfortunate fellow.  He looked at her suspiciously.  &quot;When you feel as if you are about to fall, come down right away.&quot;  She cast Spirit of the Wolf on him as an apology.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; he called over his shoulder as he dashed off.<br>
<br>
Gwion sat down away from the guards, so she wouldn't have to hear them chattering.  She squinted at the sun.  She wasn't very good at telling the hour, but it must be about time for Hamadryad to show up.  Hama had been over in Surefall Glade for some reason, but hadn't mentioned what that was.<br>
<br>
The youngster reappeared in front of Gwion, looking rather bruised.  &quot;Can you heal me again?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Those beetles are mean!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Gwion could stand up, he was suddenly all better.  She turned to see Hamadryad standing nearby, finishing off her cast.  &quot;There you are,&quot; Hama said.  &quot;Now go kill some more beetles.&quot;  He dashed off again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi Hammy,&quot; Gwion said, giving the guild founder a big hug.  &quot;What's going on?  Hey, what's in the bag?&quot;  She pointed to the extra-large pack Hamadryad wore.  &quot;Going on a trip?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Hama said, &quot;I am.  I have told the others, and now it's time for you to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gwion felt a bit nervous.  It was unlike Hamadryad to take long trips.  &quot;Know what?  Is everything all right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For the last several Norrathian years, I have been leading our group.&quot;  She rested her pack on the ground.  &quot;It has been a very good time for me, and yet I -- well, I need a rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, of course you do!&quot;  Gwion let out the breath she'd been holding.  &quot;Everybody needs a couple days off now and then.  Going on a cruise on the Maiden Voyage?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hama smiled.  &quot;Actually, I have made a decision.  As of today, I will be stepping down from the council.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ground suddenly seemed very far away from Gwion.  Vertigo made her wince, she felt a wave of nausea wash over her.  &quot;Leaving the -- you're not leaving!  What will we do?  Where are you going?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Now, relax,&quot; said Hama, &quot;I'm not leaving the guild.  It's just that I haven't seen enough of Norrath -- not all I want to see.  And it's time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gwion thought about it for a moment.  Hama did do an awful lot of work.  The rest of the group were always off killing something or other, leaving Hama sitting in the guild office, patiently answering letter after letter and meeting with the long stream of excited applicants.  When there was a disagreement, Hama handled that also.  It couldn't have been as much fun as hanging around the Karanas or buffing the new citizens of Kelethin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Gwion said, &quot;I think I understand.  But I still want to know where you are going.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been over to my home to get a few things.&quot;  Hama gestured toward the pack at her feet.  &quot;I think I'll go to Misty Thicket first, to see Grimmfaith and the orphans.  After that, I'm not sure.&quot;  She heaved the pack onto her shoulder.  &quot;I do have to get going, though, if I want to get through Kithcor Forest before night falls.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gwion felt tears starting.  &quot;All right,&quot; she managed to say.  &quot;But you will let us know where you are, won't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot; Hama said.  &quot;I will be in touch.  And if the council needs me, they will be able to find me.  But I want to watch all of you grow from a distance.&quot;  She gave Gwion a quick hug.  &quot;Goodbye dear.  Take care of each other.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then she was gone.  <br>
<br>
The tears began in earnest.  Rather embarrassed, Gwion silently thanked Tunare for Leldara's magic no-run mascara.  Then she thought of Hamadryad, happily traveling wherever she pleased.  That was a nice idea.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey -- excuse me.&quot;  Gwion felt a tap on her shoulder and turned to see the hapless young human standing there.  &quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Gwion sniffled, &quot;But look, you're not.  Hold still while I heal you.&quot;  As she cast the spell, Gwion realized how much work had yet to be done. <p>Gwion Llewellyn<BR> Level, um, 33 <BR> Convicted Snow Bunny Basher <BR> And head of the RA carpool!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usunlir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sunlir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#006400>(2/6/01 6:45:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hamadryad's New Adventures</span><hr size=1> Simply superb!! <p>Sunlir, HiE Paladin (12) season, Mastersmith, apprentice fletcher, cook, brewer, tailor, drinker<br>

<br>
Uriel wrote:<br>
It was the first time in a few months I had been out of the tree city to visit the chaos below.  Young adventures were scurrying about everywhere, frantic, trying to stay away from oversized bees and ill tempered orcs.<br>
<br>
Using a minor spell I gave a young wood elf druid some agility and healed another gnome that had somehow wandered into Greater Faydark.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Cute little gnomes...gotta love em'&quot;, I thought to myself.<br>
<br>
It was at that moment a saw some familiar tracks in the leaf covered ground below my feet.  I leaned down and memories flooded back.  Though not a ranger of great season, I had become an adept tracker.  Yes, Hamadryad was on the move.<br>
<br>
I had heard rumors of the great guild leader stepping down from that most prestigious role.  She had to decided to go on a life adventure.<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember watching her drink several male barbarians under the table back when...&quot; I whispered in confidence to the listening trees.<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember her taking a stand for her beliefs in this guild and its beliefs.  Truly a remarkable woman&quot; , a smile formed on my face.<br>
<br>
As I sit here writing, I am reminiscing back to the days when the members in the guild could be counted on two hands and one foot.  <br>
<br>
&quot;How things change&quot;, the trees whispered back. <br>
<br>
I was startled.  Trees don't talk!<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhh Uriel, ever the tracker and faithful guild member&quot;, Hamadryad stepped out from behind a large oak, <br>
<br>
Gaining my composure, I said &quot;tis good to see you m'lady&quot;, I did my kindest curtsey, but it felt awkward.<br>
<br>
Hama giggled and said, &quot;keep the acts of royalty for the high elves, Uriel&quot;  a sly mischievous smile appeared on her lips.<br>
<br>
We chatted of old times.  We chatted of good times, as well as the bad.  Though the bad times were few..they were tough.  We had made it through.  I could see the strength in her physical appearance, her eyes and her manner.<br>
<br>
I could see her fingers flexing and unflexing as if something awaited her.  I knew her visit would be short.<br>
<br>
I gave a broad, goofy smile and hugged the Adventurer, no longer a guild leader.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, what evil should be on the look out for you&quot; I asked in good humor.<br>
<br>
&quot;All of them&quot;, she laughed as she stepped into the shadows.<br>
<br>
I did not turn to see if I could spot her leave.  I did not worry about seeing her again.  <br>
<br>
I knew she would never leave us.<br>
