Kruk's shift was almost over.  The Guerga swung his hammer against the stone splitter twice more, then paused.  He heard a whisper, even against the background of pounding hammers and falling stone, but didn't see anyone near him when he looked over his shoulder.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> …almost there.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Kruk looked back to where the stone splitter hung in the crack in the wall.  Picking up the hammer, he swung.  Again and again.  Corded muscles stood up beneath his splotched yellow skin.  Every hair on his hide stood straight up.  It was calling him, whispering promises of arcane power.  Kruk's muscles screamed with pain as he hammered furiously to widen the crack in the stone.  His ears were numb from the sharp echoes of steel on steel in the tight tunnel.  Other workers were just now ending their shifts; glad they were not the ones who would have to break down the walls and shore up the ceiling before the next tunnel excavation.<br>
<br>
They were miles deep within the mountain, though they had only dug downward maybe a hundred paces.  Each week the workers dug fingers off the main tunnel.  When the Osanni foreman deemed the fingers deep enough, they reinforced the ceiling then broke down the walls between the fingers.  They had no idea how long they would be digging, Dempurgast Mangst never told them, but the work paid well and kept them fed.  The human priest had long ago gotten bored with watching the excavation, leaving that dry task to the Duke's Osanni Lieutenant.  This last week though, the High Priest of Dierguroth had made more than one appearance, twice arguing with Mangst then storming off.<br>
<br>
Kruk swung the hammer even faster, muttering 'Scresg' between each breath. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Almost.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Just when he felt his muscles were about to explode from the effort, he heard a sharp crack as the stone splitter drove through to its head.  The right side of the stone shook then fell inward.  Kruk jumped back to avoid getting crushed beneath the tons of stone and rubble that fell into the tunnel.<br>
Waving his hand to clear the dust from his eyes, he saw a small, black hole in the wall.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Almost.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taking the hammer to the wall, Kruk broke away the stone, making the hole larger.  He could feel it now, pulsing, beating in time with his heart…or was his heart beating in time with it?  Kicking loose a final stone, he dropped the hammer and squeezed into the man-sized hole.  He couldn't see it, the thought of bringing a lantern never crossed his mind, but he could sense it.  Walking into the dark cave, he knew the object was only a few paces in front of him.  Fearlessly he reached out his hands and took the last steps toward his destiny.<br>
<br>
Ror kicked aside the dry husk of the Guerga that had broken through to the Circlet's resting-place.  &quot;Fool.&quot;  He waved away the workers who moved to retrieve their fellow.  &quot;Leave him, as a warning to any others who cannot otherwise resist the urge to touch.&quot;  He looked at the ebon stone ring, then up at Mangst and nodded.<br>
&quot;Shore up and break away the last of the walls,&quot; Mangst's deep voice echoed through the tunnels.  &quot;We move the artifact on the morrow.&quot;  The Osanni gave the High Priest one final glare before turning to direct his workers.<br>
<br>
Carefully placed in a wide, iron-banded crate by Ror's undead servants, the Circlet of Mist's power pulsed softly.  The black stone of the artifact packed safely away, forty workers standing shoulder to shoulder lifted the crate onto the specially constructed wagon.  Those forty, and forty more, took up two stout ropes and started the long haul back to the surface.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it you want, Wizard?&quot;  T'ara, the new Mistress of the decimated Nine Pale Hands, stood defiantly before the White Robe's representative.<br>
&quot;You know what I want, what the Assembly wants.  The same thing you want: the Wichta who did that.&quot;  He waved his hand dramatically toward the doorway that led outside the ancient tree's chamber and to the ruins of the Caeban's encampment.  &quot;Your Caeban broke the Pact.&quot;  He quickly raised a hand to stay T'ara's protest.  &quot;By the actions of your former Mistress and this Wichta.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You must know she is not here,&quot; T'ara replied finally.  &quot;We are not even sure who it was.&quot;<br>
&quot;You know who it was.  The Shahnra child.&quot;<br>
&quot;L'ree?  It could not have been her.  She was only inducted that night.  She's a child, there's no possible way she could have that kind of power.&quot;<br>
&quot;That you know of,&quot; the mage said cryptically.  &quot;Why do you think the Pact was brought about?  The Dark Craft cares not for age or station.  She obviously had dealings with it long before now.&quot;<br>
T'ara shook her head.  She and C'ara had heard the disturbance at the center of the camp just before all hell had broken loose.  She only briefly saw the one who had called the demon to confront L'cia.  A quick glimpse of white streaked hair was all she had of apprentice L'ree, but something hadn't seemed right.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Assembly seeks an answer.  If you cannot deliver Loreana Shahnra, then I must deliver you and those that remain of the Nine Pale Hands.&quot;<br>
&quot;Those that remain have no dealings with the Dark Craft.  L'cia kept her secret even from me, and she is now dead…as are those who served her.&quot;<br>
The mage sighed and clasped his hands before him.  &quot;I understand that Mistress T'ara.  I am only a messenger of the Assembly's desires.&quot;  His black eyes twinkled briefly.  &quot;I have no wish to see the innocent brought to trial.  We both seek justice.&quot;  He paced a short distance before continuing.  &quot;I need your help to bring Shahnra to the Assembly.&quot;<br>
<br>
T'ara hung her head.  She had few options.  The Council of Diamonds had already spoken concerning the incident.  They did all but disband the Caeban.  She would find no further aid from the Diamond Wichta.<br>
The mage spoke again.  &quot;I know where the she is going.  We must move quickly if we are to catch her.&quot;  He glanced at the doorway leading outside the chamber.  &quot;But they must all come.  The whole of your Caeban must stand before the White Robes with the accused.  Only that way can their innocence be verified.&quot;<br>
&quot;But they are not involved,&quot; T'ara exclaimed.<br>
&quot;I know that, you know that, and I suspect the Assembly knows that, but…&quot; he leaned closer to whisper.  &quot;The Assembly themselves are not the ones driving this.  The Druid Maralaya is dead.  It is the Children of Gaervalen who guide the Assembly's hand in this.  If we do not deliver the Pact Breaker…we will all answer for the druid's murder.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We did not anticipate the Black God's minions moving to acquire the younger Shahnra so quickly.  For that, you have our deepest regrets.&quot;<br>
Mara's shade bowed to accept the apology.  &quot;It was Gaervalen's will that I train the elder Shahnra instead of the younger.  His eyes see further and deeper than ours.&quot;  The twelve Druids nodded at the Thirteenth's wisdom.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Child of Shadow's path is strewn with hazards.  Even now she missteps again.&quot;  The First rose from her seat, her beautiful, ethereal form towering above the heads of the other druids.  The Elan took two gliding steps to stand before Maralaya.  &quot;Our part in this act is complete.  Whether we have any further part is now up to which path the Elder Shahnra leads the Child of Light.&quot;<br>
&quot;The Black God will not stay his minion's hands in this,&quot; a stout, bearded druid whispered.<br>
&quot;If the Elder Shahnra chooses to walk in Gaervalen's shadow, she will overcome.&quot;<br>
&quot;And if she does not?&quot; he asked, knowing the answer as they all did.<br>
The ghost of Maralaya Selthai looked into the pale, golden eyes of the Elan.  &quot;There will be no third chance…for any of us.&quot;<br>
