I am by nature, independent.  I spend much time alone (unless my girlfriend is around LOL), due to the fact I have always been kind of a recluse.<br>
<br>
So, of course, when starting out on EQ I picked one of the most diverse, most interesting, and yet one of the most frustrating and slowest leveling classes out there...the Wood Elf Ranger.  I had read that they were able to solo in game.  Good for me...or so I would have thought.<br>
<br>
Well, the first few levels flew by.  I died appoximately 2 million times with a growing itch to wander...another trait of us Rangers.  In doing so I slowly (very slowly) began to realize the importance of meeting people and grouping.  I began to see familiar faces.  <br>
<br>
One of these was Talidas.  I think we first grouped in Crushbone and probably died a few times together..as is my nature in EQ.  Well, several weeks went by where everytime I came in game, I would somehow hook back up with Tal.  He was a great partner, always willing to help and with a great wit, always easy to pass the time with.<br>
<br>
During these stages of my EQ career with Tal, I became interested in guilds.  This is where my introduction to Random Acts and Hamadryad came into play.  Meeting Hama made me feel good about playing EQ and helping others out.  I like that kind of integrity in people and Hama and Random Acts has that quality.<br>
<br>
I joined.  Let me elaborate.  We got drunk out at the West Gate in Freeport!!  I had never been drunk before (at least in EQ).  Well, my first thought was, why aren't we helping people, gimme my quild tag!!!  LOL.<br>
<br>
Anyway, a few more weeks went by of adventuring.  I keep seeing Tal around and sometimes grouping with him.  Then one day, camping near the Minotuar Caves, I was hooked up with Tal..and kicking a little butt, I might add, when it dawned on me to invite Tal into the guild.  What a good decision that was!!  I asked the guild officers right then and there if I could invite Tal.  Low and behold, Ealwen was very close to us and decided to bring Tal in.  Thanks Ealwen!  The rest is history.<br>
<br>
I don't remember what level we were when we met.  I think I was one or two levels ahead of Tal (but can't be too sure).  We grouped together for several weeks after that, then the dreaded happenend.  I had to be away from my computer for weeks.  When I finally got back online in EQ, Talidas the low level had become Talidas the Bad Asssssss!!<br>
<br>
I was extremely proud of him, but disheartened that my traveling buddy was now too  high to group with.  We went on our seperate adventures.  <br>
<br>
I would say many weeks have passed since I last saw Talidas in person.  I chat with him on regular basis using the Tell command.  We keep and touch and mess with each others self confidence on a regular basis (i.e. calling each other ugly).<br>
<br>
Yesterday, we were face to face again.  Talidas came into the Commons to help me with a few issues.  I had just turned Level 17 and was able to obtain duel wield fo my ranger...dat's right!!<br>
<br>
Tal gave me a sort of birtday present...many actually.  Magic weapons, armor and other stuff.  On our way to Kelethin, our home we chatted and discussed abilities of characters.  We also buffed some people on our way back to the tree city.  It felt good.  It felt good to be helping those people.  <br>
<br>
You see, I had gotten away from the &quot;Helping others out&quot; kind of thing.  Seeing Talidas brought it back.  In our reunion, I gave away about 9 dex rings to newbies.  Like I said, it felt good.  Talidas buffed a great many people with SOW, who were all extremely greatful.  You da man Tal!!<br>
<br>
I just have to say, that I have never traveled with someone as much fun and as helpful as Talidas.  All you upper level people who get to travel with him, I am jealous.<br>
<br>
Talidas, thanks for being a friend.  Like I always said, &quot;You Da Man!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.....<br>
<br>
Good Hunting<br>

<br>
Thank you for your very kind comments. And I agree<br>
that Tal is Da Man!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I enjoyed reading this very much. And I am glad you<br>
are back.<br>
<br>
By the way, I also have a Wood Elf Ranger whom I<br>
love playing, and she does level slowly. But who<br>
cares--she's gorgeous!!<br>
