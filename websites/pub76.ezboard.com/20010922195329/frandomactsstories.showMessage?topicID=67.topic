I am not a good story teller but here is what I came up with.<br>
************************************************<br>
<br>
My name is Enplode, I am a 14th season cleric. <br>
<br>
I am from Ak'anon, I was born to two loving parents. My father Lodeitakel, and my mother Enpelopie. <br>
<br>
My mother was a jewler, she could bring a power to stones that she would touch and she could en-bed them into rings and sell them in the market place.<br>
<br>
My father was learning the skills of the rogue, so that he could get us food and water.<br>
<br>
On my second birthday, my father wanted to get me something special, so off he went, while mother entertained me. Mother and I were in my bedroom when mother heard a loud noise. She picked me out of my crib and we went to see what was going on. <br>
<br>
There lay my father, face down to the ground, blood everywhere. Mother put me down on the ground and ran to him, asking &quot;what happen&quot;, &quot;Speak to me&quot;. My father looked up and said in a ligh voice, &quot;I will be fine&quot;, Cough. mother rolled him on his back to find that he had been run through. <br>
<br>
Many years later my mother and father told me that when I saw mother crying over father, I crawled over to father and layed on his chest and asked, &quot;are you ok father&quot;. He replyed &quot;Honey, Daddy is hurt realy bad&quot;. I put my head on his shoulder and began to cry. It is said that when my tears touched his skin, he started to heal. At that point my parents knew I was special. <br>
<br>
At the age of 10, I started my first season of learning the ways of the  cleric. And that the ones who need the healing hand are usualy the ones that don't ask for it in the first place. <br>
<br>
I am today 24 years old, and in my 14th season of training in the art of the healing touch, I plan to start my journey to meet and help new poeple. I hope all goes well.<br>

<br>
So I figure that the reason being is that you didn't find your path till you were 21 or 10 years old and thats why I am a 24 year old lvl 14 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Being the harbinger of death had not stopped Azariel from forming an alliance with an unlikely cleric.<br>
<br>
He felt sure of the next spawn.  The Aviak appeared out of thin air and looked around threateningly.  Magic crackled from Azariels finger tips and pounced at the giant bird.  His Engulfing Darkness spell raced to its target, only to fail at the last second.  Realizing his mistake, he quickly sent his skeletal pet in for attack.<br>
<br>
The Aviak ripped through the pet in several blows and soon pounced on the necromancer.  <br>
<br>
The daylight began to waver and reality closed in on Azariel.  The pounding and bashing from the Aviak prevented him from casting his fear spell.  Time was up for the gnome.<br>
<br>
Just before doom brought an early closing for the dark gnomes life, he heard a soft murmuring.  Blue heaven surrounded his body and teased him to stand.  His strength renewed, he glared with red eyes at his foe.  With might and magic the necromancer cast spell after spell at the hulking bird.  He heard the words of vengeance whispered behind him.  The bird erupted into fire and collapsed to the ground.<br>
<br>
Enplode, had saved his life..he knew from the moment the blue heaven engulfed him.  He knew it from the moment they had made a pact.  The Kindness was their bond...there Acts were their seal.<br>
<br>
The young cleric healed the evil one to full health and then sent him on his way...to live up to his destiny, whatever that may be.  He never forgot the cleric..he never forgot the bond.  When the day is ripe and the war is waging..he hopes to look over his shoulder and see, blue heaven flying from kind fingertips.<br>
<br>
/ooc I enjoyed the story Oumy...I can't wait till you get that kicking machine running.  Get those levels like I know only you can.  <br>
