<br>
Buvarin Brightblade, Knight of Rodcet Nife at your service.<br>
I suppose you will wish to know something of myself, and my exploits in Norrath to this point in my life.  Hmmmm, where to start?  Well as in any good story, I suppose the beginning is the best place.  My Father, Anghus McGregor, was a White Wolf of the North, and my Mother Lorlia Brightblade a Paladin of Tunare, met on the field of battle, in the southern Karanas, she was seeking to lay to rest a vengeful spirit, and enlisted my fathers aid. (I fail to recall the spirits name at this point) They were successful, and through the course of time fell in love, and had ... ME!  Much like my mother, the gods of Norrath had lain forth my destiny at an early age, and I heard the call of Nife at the tender age of 8, where I entered the monastery and began the training required of all Knights of Rodcet Nife.  Several years later I completed my training, and emerged a squire in the service of Rodcet Nife.  Scince then I have travelled the length and breadth of Norrath spreading his word, and protecting those in need, I have recently become both a Knight of Rodcet Nife, and a Knight of Truth, both accomplishment were achieved in my 17th season.  I have also made many friends with the various Paladin guilds across Norrath, and am greeted Warmly at most. It was in my 30th season that I met a beautiful High Elven Cleric named Pikaa Thundershock, we have since traveled together, helping those in need, and facing the evils in Norrath side by side. It was at her suggestion that I seek out this family of like minded individuals, and approach them for acceptance. An undertaking I find to my liking, for there are many in Norrath who do not follow the tenants of Kindness, so it is fortunate when I meet those that do.  As to why I wish to join your family, well as I have stated, I seek the company of those that, through their actions do as I have done my whole life. I was told to inform you that Pikaa has agreed to sponsor me, which fills my heart to overflowing with joy. She has inspired to to heights I have never before dreamed where possible, and to do more than a few silly acts to gain her attention, though the preceding has little to do with my desire to join such a prestigious family.  If there is more that wish to know of me, you will have to seek me out in Norrath, for as I sit and scribe this missive, I can hear the screams of agony in the distance, and the roar of a Wurm ... I must be off ... Well met my new friends, and safe travels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/brandomacts.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=donnalinna>Donnalinna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/16/01 4:49:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=266.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why I seek to become a member of Random Acts</span><hr size=1> Hail and well met, Templar.<br>
<br>
Now, Donnalinna is not normally a stickler for rules and proper titles, but I feel that this time, it is definately needed.<br>
<br>
You see, young Buvarin, our most illustrious Pikaa is not a Elderling, but a Wood Elf.  And a Tree-singer at that... hmm... oh yes, you Youngone's call them Druids.<br>
<br>
I'm certain that she did not take offense, and you meant none by it.   Donnalinna just wishes to enlighten you on the sometimes confusing and overlapping nature of the arcane and mystic.<br>
<br>
Again, well met Templar.  It seems as if, Lord Bayle continues to encourage his citizens to the high levels of enlightenment and discovery... unlike his counterpart Lucan of Freeport.<br>

Ok..look at my Picture!!!  I am NOT a druid. AM NOT AM NOT AM NOT!!!<br>
<br>
On a serious note,  Buvarin is just the type of individual that we here at Random Acts are looking for.  How he has eluded our ranks for so long is a mystery.  I would love to have the Honor of being his sponser to the guild.<br>

<br>
I am glad to see you have organised yourself a sponsor and such like.  Below is a copy of the standard reply that I post when we recive a new application.  FYI I have reproduced it in full despite the fact that you are known to members of the guild and have a sponsor.<br>
<br>
Good luck in your quest and I look forward to meeting you in person soon.<br>

Details of upcoming events can be found on this message board under ‘Hunting And Gathering’<br>
4. Find a Sponsor<br>
A sponsor is a regular guild member that will mentor you through the fledgling quest and support you in your application.  It is also hoped that you will form a special relationship with your sponsor.  Your sponsor will also be responsible for you.  You can find who is on at any one time by typing the command &lt;/who all random&gt; <br>
(Note: Guild members can sponsor more than one fledgling.)<br>
5. Fledgling Quest<br>
Details of the quest can be found at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqrandomacts.com">www.eqrandomacts.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and don’t be afraid of asking your sponsor for assistance and advice.<br>

<br>
The road is long Fledgling, but you will find assistance, advice and kindness upon the way.  <br>
<br>

<br>
My advice is to you is to be proactive and seek out guild members near you both in Norrath and here upon the boards.  <br>
<br>
For  our records it would be helpful if you could provide us with details of your name, class, race, level, playing times, and e-mail address if you have not yet done so.<br>
<br>
Kind regards<br>

Ahem... One of the Elderling race should no better than to correct your nobility.  Now, if I say that you are a Wood Elf Tree-Singer, then you are. Because, as it is known, Elderling Nobility has the knowledge of ages behind us.  It is our difficult, and daunting task to guide the lower stratas of our race to enlightenment.<br>
<br>
Now, since you did, raise your voice, and throw a tantrum, you obviously cannot be an Elderling.  We are above such behavoirs.  Therefore, Donnalinna, is correct in all things.  I am sorry for having to point this out to you, but mistakes should be corrected.<br>
<br>
Now, but Donnalinna is known for her powers of forgiveness.  You are forgiven for taking such a rude tone with me Pikaa Thundershock.<br>
