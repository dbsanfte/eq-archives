Amethyst and Diamond were chasing her.<br>        Amethyst caught up to her and sprung on her, sending Diamond crashing into them, and they all fell in a heap on the ground. <br>        “Where did he go?” Amethyst demanded.<br>        Emerald stuck her tongue out and said, “I am not telling you!” She folded her arms and smirked. “He made me promise and I can’t break a promise.”<br>        Amethyst growled. “Why wouldn’t Fiolen tell me?”<br>        Emerald frowned in thought. “Maybe because he didn’t want you pestering him to go with you. He didn’t want you involved, he was afraid you would get hurt.”<br>        Amethyst looked hard at her. “He has gone into danger?” She had that 'there is danger involved and I am not apart of it?’ Tone. <br>        Emerald shrugged helplessly.<br>        Diamond shook her head in condolence, looking at her two best friends. Amethyst adored Fiolen. He was sixteen and had been beyond EvaClear regularly, as all Guardians do eventually.<br>         Since he had been beyond, he had merited a proper name. Everyone in EvaClear has a jewel name until they prove themselves as guardians and earn a name.<br>        His sister, Ruby was fifteen, the oldest of the five friends, and was due to get a mission. No one knew why she had not gotten it yet, but the Kingdoms were going through hard times with the demons emerging from Darkmor, so they required all the guardians they could get. She had the power of transportation. <br>        Ruby was the solemn one of the group. She had lived here her whole life, since her parents had been guardians also, although they had originated from the sixth kingdom, Elvendar. She had a lot of responsibilities so it was not surprising she was so grave.<br>        Ruby had fiery red hair and dark violet eyes, and her ears came slightly to a point, showing her half elven features. She was tall and always had serious expression on her face. <br>        Sapphire, at fourteen years of age, was new to the group since she was twelve. Her powers had only just recently been revealed. She had been brought from her home in the fourth kingdom, Delphia, to help guard the gates to the kingdoms. Sapphire had transformation power.<br>        She was the gentle, reserved one. She did not talk much, but when she did, she was sweet.<br>        Her curly black hair framed her small and delicate face. Her eyes shone a muddy yellow, and she was slightly pale from being in the water a lot. She is a naiad, a creature that lives in the water, but when out of the water loses its scales and fins, turning human. They were one of the only creatures besides pixies, that were magical that way, but could also have a magical talent.<br>        Diamond’s talent was of Illusion. She was the spontaneous, dramatic, vivacious type, and had gotten in more trouble than any one of them by using her power when it’s ‘not suitable.’ She always laughed it off when the goddess admonished her about that.<br>        Her glittering silvery blue hair extended almost to her knees, and she had dazzling blue eyes that always seemed to be happy. She was tall and slender, and very lithe.<br>        She was from the eighth kingdom, occupied by pixies, fairies, and gypsys. She herself was a full fledged gypsy. Gypsies tended to wear bright colors, and were usually merry folk, but when wronged, could be spiteful. <br>        Emerald, at fifteen, had the power to heal, and make plants grow within seconds. She was always light-hearted and put a good face on things, trying to make a bad situation better.<br>        She was slim and graceful and loved a quiet place to read. Her eyes were a spicy green, matching her hair, which was a wheat blond, with a hue of green, reaching just past her shoulders.<br>        That partly came from her powers, but she was also dryad, a creature related to elves that lived among the forest. Each dryad had their own bondtree, and so long as that tree lived, so did the dryads. It had nearly torn her to leave it and her friends behind.<br>        Amethyst ’s power, mostly she had no control over because they came to her in visions. Occasionally, she could touch something and tell you things about it. She was the reserved one. Mostly she can hide her feelings from people. Apart from her friends who knew her very well. She was the reckless and bold type who would give her life for something significant enough.<br>        Although, knowing her, she would probably find a way out of death. Not being afraid of death helps. She would be like their leader, if they had one. She, like Emerald, had grown up in the third kingdom of Rhodelia. Although, she had been an orphan until Emerald made friends with her. They had practically grown up as sisters.<br>        Amethyst had long purplish hair. It was a natural color, that matched her cold dark blue eyes. She had a slim and proud posture.<br>        They had made friends with Diamond when they were heading to EvaClear, neither of them knowing what it was and how to get there. All they had received was a letter. So they had decided to stick together.<br>        Had it not been for Amethyst, they might not have made it from their homeland, to the kingdom in order to be guardians.<br>        On account of them being so close to each other, Emerald, Diamond, and Amethyst, had a unique bond to each other. Commonly called familiar bond. They could always ‘sense' where the other was, and knew if one was in peril.<br>        After they had reached EvaClear, Ruby had become an unexpected companion. The girls had been very confused, having lived in a different world entirely. So Ruby had taken up the task of showing them around and explaining some things, having lived there her whole life.<br>        Then, several years later, Sapphire had shown up just as lost and confused as they had been, so they took her in the group.<br>        After that there had not been much more with the talent coming in, the population of mages was growing thin. Soon there would be none left......<br>        “Girls!” Emerald heard from behind her, interrupting her brooding. Bellyra was walking towards them with a determined look that always meant trouble.<br>        Diamond groaned. “No more work please.”<br>        “What are you girls doing taking a break! There is still much to learn about! If you ever want to be a full fledged guardian, you have to know everything about the Kingdoms! What kind of a guardian would you make if I sent you off half educated? Hmm?”<br>        She took a breath to continue her lecture. “I swear, you girls have too much free time on your hands.” She scowled. “Gossiping eh? About boys no doubt. Come along then. Where is Sapphire? Ah, there she is! It would do you girls good to learn from your friend, Ruby. Now there’s a girl who takes work seriously.” A genuine smile spread across her face.<br><br>* * *<br>        All the girls were sitting in their seats, waiting for the tedious lesson of Bellyra’s to end. Sapphire was gazing off into space. Ruby was listening attentively. Diamond was stirring in her seat wondering if the teacher would notice if she left [Which she would, because there was only three people besides themselves in the room.], Amethyst was drawing, and Emerald passed her a note. <br><br>        Amethyst looked at it curiously before opening. It read:<br><br>        I am sorry I did not tell you about Fiolen. I know you really care about him, but he cares for you too. He did not want you rushing off half trained, when he can manage fine. Do not fret. He is not in any danger.<br>                *~~ Emerald <br><br>        Amethyst sighed. She wrote back:<br><br>        I Know. I was just being foolish. Wonder If we will ever get out of this place? I want to see the world! I would leave this very day if I could. I am getting so bored of this Guardian life, of everything they expect of us.<br>                *~~ Amethyst  <br><br>        Stop those dreary thoughts! Leave today? Now you are starting to sound like Diamond! You know we cannot leave until we are fully trained.<br>        *~~ Emerald<br><br>        Bellyra was starting to talk of the peace treaty between the evil seventh and tenth Kingdoms when they heard screams coming from the village.<br>        Everyone got up out of their seats to see what the matter was. “Oh my!” Manganite yelled. “We’re being attacked!” <br>        “What?” Bellyra pushed everyone out of the way to have a look. “Everyone down in the shelter, Now!”<br>        Everyone one except Amethyst, Diamond, and Emerald followed her directions. “We have to do something.” Amethyst said, not the least bit worried.<br>        “I don’t know. I mean, skipping lessons is one thing, but leaving the building when there’s danger?” Emerald shook her head.<br>        Diamond grinned. “We can handle it! Come on. They need all the extra help they can get.”<br>        “Well, I’m going. Come if you want.” Amethyst raced off into the fight.<br>        “Let’s go.” Diamond urged, following Amethyst.<br>        Emerald cursed her friends under her breath and ran to catch them.<br>        Emerald spotted Amethyst blasting five Demons with a fire spell. Diamond was confusing a group of demons with her power, and they were wondering about, lost. Amethyst blasted them also.<br>        While Emerald was in a trance, watching all the fighting, something came up behind her. The demon slashed her shoulder, and she cried out in pain. She turned around, ready to fight. He was too quick. He punched her in the stomach, and she doubled over in pain.<br>        The demon took advantage over the situation to pull out a piece of cloth and smother her. She slipped into blackness.<br><br>* * *<br>        Emerald awoke sluggishly, her mind hazy. When she spotted a demon coming toward her, she screamed.<br>        _Where am I?_ Then, slowly her memory returned. She had been captured by this filth! She trembled.<br>        The demon shoved a tray of food into her cell. She looked at it cautiously, wondering if it had been poisoned. Yet why would they capture her, just to poison her food? _Besides, they would not need to put anything in it anyway. It looks deadly by itself,_ she thought, looking at it in distaste.<br>        She spotted the demon giving her a hard look, so she started to eat it. _Might as well not starve._<br>        After Emerald had finished, she was left with only her thoughts. What do they want with me? She pondered ominously if she would ever see daylight again.<br><br>* * *<br>        The four girls had a rude awakening. Diamond almost yelped when she heard the loud alarm. However, Amethyst calmly rose from her bed, and started dressing.<br>        Sapphire, who had not questioned them at all for leaving yesterday to help with the fighting hurried with them. “I wonder what that’s all about...”<br>        Ruby burst through their room and Diamond groaned. They had unnecessarily gotten a big reprimanding from her from not following directions, and most likely would get one from Bellyra also.<br>        Ruby looked at them in aggravation. “Hurry, that was the bell for a meeting of all guardians. Carramaena herself will be there.” She left.<br>        Sapphire gasped. “The Goddess of EvaClear is gonna be there?”<br>        Diamond shook her head. “That’s not good news.”<br>        Amethyst looked at her. “What about Emerald? Where could she be?”<br>        The courtyard was very crowded, with guardians and common people alike. The three guardians practically had to shove people out of the way to see what was happening.<br>        Amethyst scowled. “Ruby forgot to mention the fact that it would be crowded with the common people.”<br>        Ruby spotted them and waved them over. <br>        There was a loud cheering when the Goddess stepped forward. There were two men standing to each side of her, two of her personal guardians.<br>        Carramaena was dress in a courtly Gold gown, standing regal, her golden blond hair flowing in wisps behind her.<br>        She looked out to the crowd, and spoke. “As you all know, there was an attack yesterday. The demons somehow broke through he gate and killed Fiona, who was standing guard.”<br>        All the guardians bowed their heads in respect of the dead, for Fiona had died a noble death, fighting to the end.<br>        Ruby let out a sob. “Noo..” She moaned. Fiona had been her older sister. Sapphire put her arm around her shoulders.<br>        Carramaena spoke again. “Would Miss Diamond and Miss Amethyst please step up?” Diamond’s heart stopped. _For sure this means big trouble. The least she could do is kick us out of EvaClear._<br>        Carra smiled in a reassuring way and the girls stepped forward.<br>        To the amazement of Diamond, and everyone else, Carra said, “I would like to commend these two girls for their daring and quick thinking. If not for them, more of us might have died.” <br>        Everyone clapped and cheered. Sapphire was smiling in vivacity for the two girls, and Ruby was shaking her head in wonder, but she smiled in pride at them anyhow.<br>        “I am only sorry to say,” she started, and everyone grew silent. “That not everyone was so lucky.” She looked toward Diamond and Amethyst.<br>         “Your friend was captured yesterday. The battle yesterday was just a diversion to capture one of the guardians.”<br>        There were gasps from the crowd. “What?” Diamond had tears in the corner of her eyes.<br>        “Emerald?!” Sapphire asked horrified.<br>        Carra nodded. “But, why?” Ruby asked.<br>        Carra shook her head. “I’m not sure. But I think they want to know where all the gates are, and the code to get into them. Emerald might not know all of them, but the demons would not realize that. The might end up killing her, for not revealing the secrets.” Diamond and Sapphire let out a sob of horror.<br>        “Emerald doesn’t have the power to defend herself, she was only blessed with the power healing, but that won’t help her now. That was why she was such easy prey.”<br>        Amethyst looked at her friends in determination. “Then we must save her before they have a chance to kill her.”<br>        Amethyst was scared- just as scared as Diamond, but she would never show that. The only thing she could think of now was saving her friend.<br>        “It will be a very dangerous journey.” Carramaena warned. “The enemy is very clever.”<br>        “Then we will just have to out smart them.” Ruby said, stepping forward, Sapphire with her.<br><br>* * *<br>        When Emerald woke, she felt a sharp nip on her toe. She sat up, and came face to face with a huge rat. She screamed and scuffled back. It was as big as her foot!<br>        The rat stared at her for a moment, it’s big red eyes showing intelligence. Then it wobbled through a hole in the wall. Amethyst shivered, wrapping her arms around her legs. She hated rats.<br>        A few moments later, the demon came back inside. He shoved food into her cell, again without saying anything. She thought, while she was in here, she might as well try to make friends with him, and try to get some information out of him.<br>        “Please, where am I?” Emerald tried tentatively. He grunted, not answering her.<br>        She tried again, “Please, I do not think it would hurt anyone if you told me where I am...”<br>        Still, he said nothing. _Most unfriendly._ She thought bitterly. _I will try later. Maybe he will be more willing. After all, It is only morning._<br><br>* * *<br>        The day Amethyst, Sapphire, Ruby, and Diamond  left was a hot one. Carramaena had given them horses and provisions that should last a few weeks. She had also insisted that Rodda, her daughter, go with them. _‘She can be very useful. After all, she does communicate to inanimate objects.’_ Was how she had justified it.<br>        _Oh, good. She can make furniture talk. That’s gonna do us all a lot of good._ Diamond thought bitterly. She had not said anything to Carra, of course.<br>        “Good fortune to you all.” Carramaena voiced when they had reached The Tenth gate, Darkmor.<br>        “We’re gonna need more than that.” Diamond  muttered.<br>        “Thank you, Goddess. We will return.” Ruby responded.<br>        “Good bye my beloved.” She said to her daughter.<br>        Rodda took a deep breath. “I’ll make you proud. Bye-bye.”<br>        “I’ll make sure naught happens to her.” Sapphire vowed.<br>        The girls stepped through the gate, ready to embark on their expedition<br><br><br>                [Darkmor, 10th Kingdom]<br><br>        “Tell me again why we cannot just transport in there and kick some ass?” Diamond grumbled.<br>        “Because, the Palace is surrounded by a shield of dark enchantments. My power isn’t competent enough. It would shred us apart.” Ruby answered pragmatically.<br>        Although Diamond could not fathom how they could be so calm when they were out in the midst of an infinite desert, heading towards sure death, she nodded. “How ‘bout some cheery music? It’ll give us something to do.”<br>        Amethyst shook her head. “Might be heard.” She looked at Ruby. “Are you sure you know which way to go?”<br>        “Yes! I’ve studied the map carefully.”<br>        “But has anyone ever survived long enough to get an accurate markings?” Amethyst replied pointedly. “And anyway, Dark Magic can play tricks on your eyes. We’d better make sure.” Her icy blue eyes bored in to Ruby’s.<br>        Sapphire gave a broad smile at Rodda. “Can you ask around?”<br>        “Yes, but insentient things can be a little tricky sometimes.” She dismounted and turned to one of the rocks. “Ya know, this dark magic around here is so powerful. I’ll bet even you rocks couldn’t tell us where to find the Dark Palace.”<br>        To Diamond’s amazement, the rock answered. “Oh yeah?! I know to the very inch where it’s located! But I’m not gonna tell you!”<br>        He started launching insults at her. She turned to the next rock. “I doubt that rock there knows anything! But you look pretty smart. I’ll bet you know where it is!”<br>        “What?!” The first rock said. “I do know where it is!”<br>        “Don’t trust _him!_ He wouldn’t know if someone came up and threw him!” Said the second.<br>        In between slanderous retorts to the second rock, he told them directions.<br>        Beaming in triumph, Rodda remounted. Diamond  smiled at her in approval.<br><br>* * *<br>        When they set up to camp that night, Amethyst told them not to arrange a fire. “But how are we to eat?” Sapphire asked.<br>        “We have bread, and berries. We don’t want the demons to know we’re here. A blaze will give us away.”<br>        “To bad Emerald isn’t here, or we could sprout our food.” Diamond sighed.<br>        “If Emerald were here, this expedition would be pointless.” Ruby pointed out, rankled.<br>        Afterward, while everyone was eating dinner, Amethyst spoke up to everyone, using mind speech, in the event that anyone-or anything was around to hear.<br>        :When we get closer, Diamond, you are gonna have to use your power to make us look like Demons. I know it will probably tire you after a few days, and we do not require it now. <br>        :This area should be nearly deserted, so any demons we come across will be few and far apart. We can just kill them off.<br>        :We might fortuitously run into a warband of demons if we are not careful. We want to elude that at all costs. Sapphire we will need you to transfigure into a hawk and scout the area.<br>        :Maybe ask a few animals if an army has passed through here. Rodda, you can do the same, and maybe you can find out if a troop of demons has passed by, a young woman with them.:<br>        She nodded :What do you want me to do?: Ruby asked, accepting Amethyst’s role as leader.<br>        She thought a moment while she continued to hone her knife, then answered, :Tell me everything you can about demons and dark magic.:<br><br>* * *<br>        Over the past few days, Emerald had gotten so used to the presence of the demon. The familiar form was there when she woke, to feed her, and stayed till she slept. She knew it was because they did not want her to escape, but he still became a reassuring presence in her new prisoned life.<br>        Infact, when she had woken one day by the but of a spear jabbed in her side, and an unfamiliar face growling at her, she became frightened.<br>        “Get up.” He snarled. Having no other alternative, she stood. He unlocked the gate, and motioned her out of the cell. Two demons grabbed her arms and tied them taut, holding the other end of the rope.<br>        The foremost demon led them out into a drab hall. From the way the demon was equipped, and talked, she gathered he was probably higher in ranking then the other two.<br>        He was armed in red guise, with a log curved knife at his side. His shield had the emblem of a black dragon, with fire behind it. The two guards adjacent to her were outfitted in brown, with no weapons.<br>        Curiously, Emerald pondered where they were going. She found out a few moments later. She was ushered into a very dark cavern, and she had the uncanny feeling that they were under ground. She gave an involuntary shiver.<br>        Abruptly, everything was silent. All talking ceased, and each person that had been moving stopped. All the demons were now looking towards the black doorway.<br>        She looked intimately at the markings on the frame, heeding the tiny drawings of little demons, evil spirits, fire, and devilish beings. Infact, the whole cavern had been scattered with similar markings.<br>        She had been studying it so tenaciously that Emerald was caught by surprise when the demon guards beside her knocked her to a kneeling position.<br>        Everyone around her was doing the same.<br>        She raised her head to see what was happening The door that she had studied silently swung open. The tallest demon she had ever seen stood before them. _The Demon King Pythra?_ She wondered.<br>        His voice was low and guttural when he spoke to the guards in the demonic language. The three guards followed him through the doorway, dragging Emerald along.<br>        The Demon King motioned to the guard in red. He came closer. They spoke, and the guard produced a key. From the way he was handling it, and the shrewd look on his face, Emerald guessed it was the key to the gates.<br>        That’s when Emerald recognized who the demon guard was. The same who had seized her in EvaClear. <br>        Emerald’s stomach tensed in fear._Oh no! Now all they need are the codes._ And there was no doubt in her mind as to how they were gonna get it. Through her.<br>        After King Pythra dismissed the guard, he turned to Emerald. He took a step closer, a ruthless smile pasted on his face.<br>        She shrank back, and closed her eyes. She took a deep breath, clearing her mind.<br>        He cackled, seeing her cringe. “I’ll make this easy for us both, if you cooperate.” She did not believe _that_ for a minute. “I will make a deal with you that will satisfy us _both._ Now, I need the codes, and you wish to escape.”<br>        “You would never show weakness to your people by letting a captive go.” She spat. “That would mean the next demon would come along to steal your place. No I don’t believe any of this rubbish. Just kill me.” At this, she turned back to the wall, her face expressionless.<br>        King Pythra laughed in amusement. “Courageous little guardian. Of course, you’re right. But I have other means of having what I want.” He snarled.<br>        She was incensed now. “Don’t think you can torture it out of me! Thespirit protector Lyfe will protect me if I call upon her. I would die before I tell you a thing!”<br>        He shook his head gravely. “No. I do not believe torture would accomplish anything with you. I need something more... infallible.”<br>        Emerald became alarmed. The King motioned for the two remaining guards to follow him. He advanced to the other side of the room, and pulled a lever that she had not perceived previously.<br>        The two guards shoved her through first, and they undertook their descent down the stairs. King Pythra followed behind, sealing the door, and lighting a torch. <br>        The stairs were made of what looked like stone. They were not damaged nor cracked at all, but they were evidently aged with dust. Emerald guessed that they were not used frequently.<br>        She held her breath, and finally they reached the end. They were now standing in the biggest cavern she had ever seen. The King laughed. “My own little retreat. Cozy, eh?”<br>        _Far from cozy. It’s so doleful, it’s giving me shivers._ Emerald shuddered. The room was so grimy since it was not used much. Also, the little lights that were in it were very dim. You could not see past fifteen feet. Nevertheless, she knew it was huge, because their voices echoed out distantly, and she could sense the void.<br>        “Not so brave any more? Well, shall we?” He barked something in his language and the guards dumped her on the ground. They backed away out of sight.<br>        Now Emerald was thoroughly scared. He grinned maliciously. “If I can’t break your resistance physically, I shall try it emotionally.”<br>        King Pythra looked into her eyes, muttering alien words that she did not recognize. The kind that may only be heard and forgotten.<br>        She felt herself grow hazy, her resistance was slowly crumbling. No! She screamed in her mind. _He’s a Demon Mage? How can that be? They were all destroyed in the Kingdom Wars! _<br>        She felt as if she was going into a trance. She knew everything that was going on, but she could do nothing about it. He looked deeper into her eyes, and the last of her hindrance melted away. He smiled.<br>        “Who are you?” He asked. She did not want to answer. She told herself to reveal nothing, but her mouth moved of its own accord.<br>        “I am Emerald of EvaClear, guardian in training.”<br>        His face darkened. “In training?” He grumbled. “What are the codes to the gates of EvaClear?”<br>        This time, she did not answer. He slapped her. “I asked you a question! What are the codes?”<br>        “I do not know. Guardians in training are not allowed to access the codes, for we are not to leave EvaClear before we are done training. That would mean-”<br>        “Enough! Are you to tell me that you are useless? I should have you killed.” When The King had calmed a little, he changed his mind and instead asked, “What is EvaClear’s weakness?”<br>        Well, every one knows _that._ “The Golden Crystal. It’s what keeps the Guardians alive for as long as they’re required. No one can kill them unless they have The Golden Crystal. It also keeps the land prosperous, and seeks those who have the gift.”<br>        “Where is it kept?” He asked, his voice butter sweet. The spell over her compelled her to answer. “The Goddess Carramaena hides it. No one knows where it is kept but her.”<br>        King Pythra growled, his good mood disappearing again. He thrashed her with his claws, bellowing. She screamed in terror and agony. She called upon the good spirits to protect her, but as soon she had healed one wound, another arose, making her efforts futile. So she endured her suffering in silence.<br><br>* * *<br>        Sapphire trudged through the sand. She had just departed from her friends, to scout the area. She started undressing, because transforming dead matter was not a part of her ability. She piled up her clothes and put it in her parcels, and left it in the underbrush. Since her company was following the River of The Lost, they could effortlessly detect and hold them for her until she got back.<br>        She closed her eyes, and began murmuring words that could only be heard and  then beyond recollection. She called to her protector, Kimricca, to give her the power required to transform. Sapphire felt the strength run through her body, and felt the contact of her protector. She began to change.<br>        She felt fur run down her arms, chafing. Sapphire repressed the urge to scratch and continued to contemplate the animal she was altering. Her face bulged out in front, like a dog’s snout, and she had the tingling sensation of her bones forming a different shape, shrinking in some areas, and extending in others. The bone in her back side extended, creating a tail.<br>        She was now in the shape of an Earth creature, called a wolf. She tested her senses, found that she had extremely good sent, hearing and trifling eye sight. Well, that was only to be anticipated. For her duty, she wouldn’t particularly need to see in any event.<br>        Sapphire smelled the air, detecting the reek of Demon. Demons were typicaly smelly, but existing in a wolf’s body emphasized it ten times worse. Nevertheless, she followed the track, noting that they were heading in the route that her friends were arriving from, the south. The smell exceeded a hundred. Her heart stopped. _What if my friends are caught?! _<br>        Sapphire urgently followed the river and the sent south. It was miles succeeding. Just when she was confident that she had them, the sent was lost. _What? I just had it! Why did it disappear so suddenly?_ Thinking the wind had changed, she turned different angles. Still it was lost.<br>        Dejected, she headed back. She felt a tugging on her fur. She jerked around. No one was there. She felt it again on her head, and all over her body. It felt like.... She was changing back! Something was affecting her magic, making her transform back without her wanting it.<br>        Then she realized with cold dread that she did not have her attire with her. Her face burned with embarrassment. She was almost done changing. She would have to find them again. Unless her friends had them. She had to alert her friends about the demons before they were discovered. She was thankful it was a heated day in the desert.<br><br>* * *<br>        The two demon guards threw Emerald to the floor and locked the gate. She lay there a moment, breathing profoundly.<br>        Emerald was bloodied and battered, but did not move to heal herself. _Why bother? I do not deserve it. This is all my  fault anyway..._<br>        She sat up when she perceived a creaking noise. The demon. He was back. She relaxed a little. He nudged a tray through the gate.<br>        Emerald stared at it in yearning. _I do not deserve it._ Her thoughts came back to her. Then she heard another voice in the back of her mind. She pictured Diamond’s face clearly, saying “Come on girl! Don’t be so mopey. Take what you can get.” Her eyes twinkled in amusement. Then she saw Amethyst. “Eat. You need your strength. How else do you expect to escape?” They disappeared.<br>        Emerald laughed. _Yes, that’s what they would say were they here._<br>        She took the food gratefully, not heeding that today, it was different. The bread was _not_ moldy, the foods not stale, and the water was cold. After eating, she felt more refreshed, and noticed how tired she was. <br>        Emerald lay down, ignoring her discomfort, and fell asleep.<br>        She awoke a few hours later, confronted by her helplessness and fear.<br>        She leaned again the wall, and noticed the demon staring at her in sympathy. _That’s the most emotion he has shown. Maybe I can make him warm up to me._<br>        She smiled feebly at him. He nodded his head in greeting.<br>        “Hello. My name is Emerald. What is your name?”<br>        He shrugged helplessly. She fumbled for something to say. <br>        “You seem like a nice guy. Won’t you please at least say something? I have been so lonely...” She broke off, feeling a lump in her throat.<br>        This was too much for him. He made gestures with his hands, pointing to his throat.<br>        “What? You can’t talk?” _Of course! They did not want the guards slipping, saying something that was not supposed to be said._<br>        She brightened with new hope. “Let me see.”<br>        He opened his mouth and she let out a cry of relief. His tongue had been removed. Emerald sighed. “I can fix that. I can heal you.” The demon shrank back. “Oh, don’t worry. It won’t hurt. You’ll just feel a tingling.”<br>        Still, he was somewhat diffident. “Look.” She said focussing on her arm. It had a nasty red welt, dried with blood. She put her hand over the wound, calling to the healing spirit, Lyfe. She whispered a spell that could only be heard and be forgotten, never remaining in your mind.<br>        Her arm healed. The skin grew over the old, making it look as if it had constantly been like that. There were no apparent scars.<br>        He relaxed visibly. She coaxed him closer, putting a hand on his throat. She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath. Then she started to pray, calling upon her spirit protector, Lyfe, for strength.<br>        Though, this time it was different. There was a resistance. Something was blocking the path to healing him. She fought against it, unsuccessfully.<br>        The demon started to grow restless. She tried breaking it, going around it, and going through it. Nothing worked. She called the spell, harsher and more fervently. She tried elaborating, and improving the spell.<br>                Something shimmered and appeared in her mind....It was..._Lyfe?!_<br>        “Hello, Emerald. I see you are having trouble. I cannot help you escape because I’m only an apperation, that you called upon.”<br>        Emerald stared in shock. The she shook her head to clear it. “Why is there a block? Why can I not heal him?”<br>        Lyfe smiled, approvingly. “Emerald. You have not changed. Still, you think of healing before yourself.” She grew serious. “He is enchanted. You must break that spell. It was put on him by a very powerful mage. If we put our powers together, we can break through it.&quot;<br>        Lyfe closed her eyes. A green beam of light shot out through Lyfe’s hands and went in to Emerald. “There. Now you are powerful enough. You need not call upon my strength to give you powers next time. You have all the strength you need in yourself. Seek it there.”<br>        She blinked away. Emerald tried again, pushing at the block, picturing herself beyond it. Finally it gave way. Slowly it crumbled.<br>        Emerald withdrew her power, her strength draining away with the effort. She almost fainted, and felt herself falling to the ground.<br>        She felt strong arms catch her. _The demon? Wait..._ It felt like human arms. Her eyes fluttered open. It was a man! “What?” She moaned.<br>        “You need to regain your energy.” His voice was strong and deep. “By healing me, you used up most of it.” He tipped a glass of water to her lips. She drank it gratefully. “Who are you?” She asked trying to rise.<br>        His face was lined with worry. “You should stay there until you’re rested all the way.” To Emerald, he looked as though he were twenty. His bright blue eyes were honest and intelligent. He was sturdy, and his stance was like that of a warrior. He had sandy blond hair, wavy and wind blown. His pale face and skinniness suggested that he had been under ground and not very well fed for years. Which he probably had.<br>        He was staring at her intently. She blushed. “Are you a guardian?” _He has a nice accent..._<br>        She started, surprised. “Yes. Well almost.” She gave a small smile. “Who are you? Why did they put that spell over you? Where did-”<br>        He laughed, holding a hand up to halt her. “I am the Dragon Lord, Gwynden. From the sixth kingdom of Elvender.”<br>        Her eyes had gone wide, almost childlike. “A Dragon Lord? One of the legendary Dragon Lords?” Suddenly she became very shy.<br>        He shook his head somberly. &quot;The enchantment Pythra put over me kept me the same age, while being a demon.&quot; His tone grew more urgent. &quot;I hope you have rested enough. We need to get out of here and I need to reclaim my ocarina.&quot;<br>        &quot;I must steal back the key to EvaClear.&quot; She started to stand, but stumbled. Gwynden caught her arm to support her, and gently lowered her to the ground.<br>        &quot;You will do no such thing. Wait here until I get back. I have been here these past seventy five years. I know the path well. I can grab my ocarina and the key, get back, and then we can leave together.&quot;<br>        She tugged on his arm in dismay. &quot;Please! Do not leave me! I don't know if I can bear to stay here anymore!&quot;<br>        She looked so vulnerable and needy that he almost gave in. He grabbed her shoulders. &quot;I will be safer by my self. I _will_ come back. By the Gods, I swear it.&quot;<br>        &quot;Okay...&quot; He left her alone, and she let the tears flow.<br>        Looking back once more, he straightened his shoulders, preparing for his next task. <br><br>* * *<br>        Sapphire pushed a branch from her face, and spotted her baggage, quickly stuffed under the bush. She shook her head. _Should have hidden it better. Someone could have found them._ Nevertheless she had been in a hurry, not thinking of the consequences. _That still does not make it right. Next time be more careful._<br>        She hurriedly dressed herself. She took out her water canister and took a big gulp. It was not cold, but it helped her parched throat. She tucked it back in, and wiped sweat from her forehead. She needed to find her friends, and fast. They should have already been past here.<br>        _Diamond would have put her Illusion over them to fool any demon._ She reasoned.<br>        Then she thought of something. Maybe Diamond’s power had failed her, as Sapphire’s did. Yet, how could that happen? What was going on? _You are not going to accomplish anything standing here idle._<br>         She started to get up, but the sound of boots crunching, and voices speaking in low and urgent tones stopped her. She could not understand though, because they were speaking the demonic language.<br>        She lay on her stomach to seem more inconspicuous, listening for the voices to drift away. They did not. Sapphire began to get nervous. She crawled closer to see if they were gone. Sapphire came face to face with the demon. He smiled, flashing his dirty pointed teeth, and his foul breath seeping out.<br>        She shrank back, instinctively trying to change into a small animal. Then she remembered she did not have control of her power. She wondered briefly if it was the fault of this demon.<br>        “Well, well. Looks like we caught ourselves another guardian. You were right Kejji, she was hiding where you sensed her.” He said the last with a glance backward.<br>        _Others? Oh no! My friends were caught!_ She inwardly groaned.<br>        Sapphire heard a contempt voice answer indignantly. “Well of course she was there, Gorthal. My power never fails. Grab her quick, you imbecile before she runs!”<br>        Sapphire swore. Why did she not think of that?! Too late. She turned to run, only to have the demon’s strong arm grab her leg. She kicked furiously, trying to shake him off. He was unshakable. Gorthal pulled, dragging her backward.<br>        Sapphire screamed. She reached into her boot, bringing out her knife. She did not know what she was doing. If she had been in her right mind, she would realize a little old knife would have no effect against a demon of that size. Except to get him mad. Foolish really.<br>        She started slashing at the arm that had attached itself  to her leg, trying to puncture his arm. With scales, that is a very hard thing to do. Nonetheless, she did it until her arm ached.<br>        “Had enough?” Gorthal asked, becoming bored of this game. Somehow he had gotten hold of her arms, something she did not remember happening. However, she found she did not really care, as she was slipping into exhausted blackness.<br><br>* * *<br>        Lord Belaer Tutamken paced his tent, brooding over the orders he had just received from King Pythra. King Pythra had just ordered that Lord Tutamken organize all his troops, and head back to the Dark Palace.<br>        Lord Tutamken had been headed to Ba’ako, his home. They had done their task, a quick attack at EvaClear, get the hell out of there, and head home. This unexpected change in plans would set his troops in a bad mood. Nonetheless, he was not there to question the King’s order and get his head chopped off his shoulders. He was there to follow orders, and if necessary, do some of his own chopping of heads.<br>        Lord Tutamken was one of the most feared and ruthless of them. He had not gotten his reputation undeserved. Fear brought obeyance, and obeyance brought respect. He barked out an order to a guard, telling him to get the Captain Blean.<br>        The Captain appeared a moment afterward. He bowed and said, “Yes my Lord?”<br>        “Gather all the men together, and get ready to ride.” Tutamken answered.<br>        He looked quizzical, but nodded. “Right away my Lord.”<br>        He turned to leave, and almost scrambled into Yurriah, the cadvridoc. He lingered a little while to see what the cadvridoc had to say.<br>        Cadvridoc Yurriah bowed. “Lord Tutamken, Captain Blean.”<br>        “Yes?” Tutamken asked crossly.<br>        “The guardians you inquired about? Well it seems you were right. They were headed north to the palace. They were following the River of The Lost, and were going to go between the twin lakes. Prince Kejji found them with his locating and identifying power.” He stood ready, waiting for orders.<br>        Lord Tutamken thought a moment. “Send him in, I would like to speak with him.” He gestured that they were dismissed.<br>        “Lord, he has left.” <br>        “What?” The Lord spun around. “On whose authority?”<br>        Yurriah flinched, and replied, “Well, he had reason to believe that there were more guardian hiding.”<br>        Tutamken growled. “Prince Kejji is getting to be quite bothersome. If he doesn’t learn to follow orders, he’ll be answering to me. Dismissed.”<br><br>* * * <br>        When Diamond heard a noise, she bolted right up. “What is it?” Amethyst looked at her. Diamond looked for the source of the noise. Just a rat.... She noticed how Rodda, Carramaena’s daughter was shaking. Probably in fear or shock. Diamond did not blame her, after what those men had done to her, trying to get answers about EvaClear, and her mother. The torture she had received burned in her memory, like a nightmare.<br>        The girls were now in a tent, guarded all around, with no hope to escape. They did not even have their magic to help them. Not being able to feel her power, made a guardian feel empty and useless. As if nothing else in the world mattered. They knew their power was not gone forever, and that was a comfort.<br>         Amethyst stared into the empty void, thinking. _The demons must have a special type of spell with them._<br>        The only thing she could think that can be used to ward off magic was a certain kind of plant, hidden deep in the forest, where the Pixie King and Fairy Queen had hidden it.<br>        The pixies use stuff like that to cause trouble amongst people new to the area. The plant, boaboa, has to be shredded into very fine pieces, and mixed with a powerful chemical used to kill magic creatures, which is not used much, or easy to find since it was outlawed in most areas. Then you had to find a spirit to give it power, and lock all of them inside a crystal. So you see, it would be very hard to make a warding crystal. It was the only thing Amethyst could think of however, and that scared her.<br>        Diamond spoke up, to fill the silence that was beginning to madden her. “What were those lakes I saw on the map? It seems we were almost past them.”<br>        Ruby lay back, relaxing. “The twin lakes. Called Lake Death Watch.”<br>        Diamond’s head perked up. “Why? Does someone watch over them?” She brushed back her silver hear, braiding it.<br>        Ruby leaned forward. “No, they say it’s because of the witches.” She paused, waiting for the-<br>        “_Witches?_ You mean those who serve the underworld?” Diamond’s face was a mask of calm. She _hoped._<br>        Ruby nodded slowly. Amethyst was not listening to them. She was busy planning their escape. Rodda started to shiver violently. Diamond put an arm around her, comforting her.<br>        Ruby spoke up again, startling them both. “A long time ago, before witches were thought evil, there were two sisters. Lady Malonna and Lady Ranae of Sireton. They would work together in their evil spells. Killing people who they thought wronged them. Stealing from the more powerful. Soon they became the richest and most respected in Sireton.<br>        “Until a young man stumbled onto their little secret while they were sacrificing a young woman to the underworld. Unfortunately, he only saw Malonna, and she got sentenced to death. Ranae was no where to be seen. They burned her body and dumped it into the lake. That’s when her sister, Ranae showed up. She cursed the people and swore undying vengeance.”<br>        “What happened?” Diamond’s voice was small. This reminded her of the times when she was a little girl, and they would tell horror stories. Except now, she was in one.<br>        “She killed them. Every last one.” Ruby drawled. “Then she took over the seventh kingdom, Tolnedra, becoming their Empress. One of the biggest tragedies in history. She has been very troublesome in the least.”<br>        “So... What about the lake? How did it get the name?” Diamond squeezed closer to Rodda, a concerned look on her face. Rodda was now sleeping against her shoulder.<br>        Ruby sighed. “People claimed, before Ranae killed them, that the ghost of Malonna still lingered. Anyone who dared go in between them, never came back. That’s why they call it Death Watch. Supposedly Malonna’s spirit is still there... using her power against trespassers.”<br>        They heard voices and footsteps coming nearer, so the girls quieted. The tent flap opened and someone was shoved in, followed by two guards.<br>        “Sapphire?” Rodda spoke up, surprising Ruby and Diamond.<br>        She shook her head. In a soothing voice she said, “Yes, Rodda. Get rest while you can.” Rodda nodded with a yawn, glanced at Diamond, and fell against her shoulder again, asleep.<br>        The guards tied Sapphire’s feet and hands, like the other’s, so she could not physically fight her way from within.<br>        When they left, she mindspoke to them in a confident voice, that had a desperate hint to it. :We will escape. I promise little Raven.: This last she spoke only to Rodda, who heard it in her sleep, and was somehow comforted by it.<br><br>* * *<br>        Gwynden plastered himself to the wall. He heard footsteps. Their shadow showed him just at what moment to lunge, burying the knife in their throats. _Wait for it... wait...._<br>        As he listened more carefully, he realized that the steps were too light to be demon. Moreover, the shadow that the lantern cast showed someone of a skinny frame. He froze in shock. _Damn that woman!_<br>        He grabbed Emerald’s shoulder as she turned the corner. She was caught off balance, and almost tumbled when he reached out and held her steady.<br>        “That’s three times.” She said, her face red.<br>        “What are you doing here?” He almost yelled, but caught himself.<br>        “I’m not gonna let you get into danger without me. Besides. I still don’t trust you. What if you leave me?”<br>        “I am a Dragon Rider! A man of honor! I would never break my promise.” He cried in ire.<br>        “So you say.”She scoffed. The truth was, she would feel bad if someone died and she would not be there to help. As well as that, she did not intend to let him have fun without her!<br>        He cocked his head. “How did you get out of there? I made sure it was locked.....”<br>        Emerald smiled coyly. “A trick I picked up from a gypsy friend. Lock picking.”<br>        “Great. A thief for a friend. Just what did you do to get in here anyway? If it’s for some heinous crime, I will not be surprised.”.<br>        Her expression turned to one burdened by some horrible deed. He was almost sorry he asked. “They captured me to get information on the location of all the gates.” She explained vaguely. “So, are we going to do this or not?”<br>        He nodded. &quot;We must hurry, for if they see you are not in there, they will call the alarm. We dont have much time.&quot;<br><br>      *Lady Aioki<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugndmwnggrl24.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GndmWngGrl24</A> at: 3/16/01 1:48:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=risika>Risika</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/25/01 12:12:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EvaClear- Dancing Gems, part one</span><hr size=1> Greetings! I enjoyed reading your story, Lady Aioki (I hope I spelled it right!!) You had a very solid storyline that took minimal effort to follow, that's a difficult thing to do and I speak from my non-professional writing experiance. You introduced us to your characters right at the very beginning and in a paragraph each. Your writing would be a little stronger if you showed the physical, spiritual, and emotional traits of the characters gradually throughout the story. General Example: &quot;Gloria ran her hand through her red hair in frustration, a gesture familiar to those who knew her.&quot; That shows indirectly that Gloria has red hair and you can make the assumption that she is often frustrated. Other than that your use of vocabulary was excellant and I could easily picture the individual settings in my mind. I really think you have something going here, and I look forward to reading future installments.

You have a wonderful imagination and a great discriptive writing style.  I also enjoyed your occasional touches of humor throughout the tale.<br><br>The main weakness, I would say, is structural and that is the easy part of writing..... easy to learn and easy for an editor to correct without making changes to your thought.  By structural, I mean things like sentence and paragraph structure.... where commas should go and how to connect parts of a sentence so that the result isn't choppy.<br><br>An example of what I mean  can be shown in the following paragraph from your story:  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> All the girls were sitting in their seats, waiting for the tedious lesson of Bellyra’s to end.

I normally wouldn't make any comments about another writer's style or skill, but since you asked for some input, here's mine:<br><br>The story is great.  The pacing of your work is extremely fast, and develops solidly.  However, I think you need to be more patient with your work.  I would recommend writing, just for yourself, a one page description of each main character in your story.  Put some thought into the background of each one, as well as what their goals and dreams are.  What motivates them?  You've already touched on this with your one paragraph descriptions, but give me more.  Also, when you describe places, really think about what they look like.  You have a picture in your mind's eye of the locations, but we don't.  Give us a framework to work with.  What do the &quot;gates&quot; look like?  What kind of trees were in the field they were playing in?  What kind of birds flew by.  Were their fish in the water?  What did the school look like?  Did it smell like Lysol or paste?  What were the desks made of?  How about the meeting hall?  Did it smell musky?  How was it lit?  What did the &quot;normal people&quot; look like?  Ask yourself questions continuously as you write, and write the answers down.  <br><br>Also, don't feed me all at once.  I like your descriptions of your characters, but hold them in a little bit.  Some of the best books I have read didn't tell me what the main character looked like until I was 150 pages in, or more.  Someone else said something similar above, and they were right.  Give us situational descriptions.  I won't give you any examples, because I don't want to influence what you write, but just keep in mind to constantly be describing everything, not jut the action.<br><br>Punctuation and structure.  This comes from practice.  Sasi said this is the easy part, I disagree.  A well structured paragraph is a thing of beauty in itself, and is very difficult to get just right.  Same with a sentence.  Read a little Hemingway, then read a little Melville, and you will see what I mean.  One is very concise, the other is rambling.  Both are considered classics, but most people only like to read one of the above.  I'll let you decide for yourself.  This part of writing only comes from practice and dedication, and can be extremely frutrating.  Sometimes, things you thought were just right are actually completely wrong, and only expertise in mechanics can help here.  Editors, for the most part, have that expertise.  But a sloppy manuscript will almost never make it.  Don't neglect this part of your craft.<br><br>Polish.  Most books are never truly &quot;finished&quot;, the author is just &quot;done&quot;.  You can always tweak a little here or there.  Re-read what you write, look at it with a critical eye.  Critics and editors are a brutal, viscious lot, and they will rip your work apart, piece by piece and word by word.  Beat them to it.  Don't read your own work for enjoyment until you can go to the bookstore and buy it.  This takes practice.<br><br>All of a sudden, writing sounds like joyless, tedious, work!  OH NO!  Fear not, because it's rarely that.  Writing is your way to express yourself, never forget that.  Even if nothing you write is ever published, it's still more than worthwhile.  It is art.  <br><br>Keep writing.<br> <p>Vandaal Steelthorn <BR>Hybrid Caste Officer <BR> Circle of Pride <BR><B>"Tentanda Via!"</B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=ffffca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Dorf Extraordinaire</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/28/01 2:54:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Dorraxx4a.jpg height=204 width=180 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EvaClear- Dancing Gems, part one</span><hr size=1> /ooc<br><br>Well done.

I noticed a lot of 'her', 'she', 'his', etc, at the beginning of sentences.  Most of this while you were describing the characters.  This jumped out at me for one, main reason.  I have been very guilty of this in my writings and it took a lot of work to stop doing it.  I'm not even sure I've gone about it the right way, but I try to structure the sentences differently.<br><br>Here's one I just picked at random.

Almost everything I've written has been written at least twice.  It helps to read and re-read what you've written and listen to how it sounds in your head. Some people recommend reading aloud to see if it sounds natural.<br><br>All in all I like it very much.  You have a definite idea of who your characters are, what they're doing and where your story is going. As Vandaal said, a book is never truly finished.  Don't edit yourself into the ground.

Well, i hope more people reply.<br><br><br>Note: A few things i have to say. Ignore the disclaimer, its not supposed to be there. Rodda is pronounce Rotha. There might be a few changes, my stories are ever changing. One thing I thought of earlier was changing a name. Amethyst sofits better with the healing power, but Emerald is more earthly, and represents life. hmm... Some things in here might not make sense, or i havent followed through with them, but it is only an out line. I wanted to see what people thought of it. There were several versions berfore this and again will be several more. I hope everyone will be there helping me while i go through these changes. Im always coming up with new ideas (even today!!) and i hope this story will turn out to be something.<br><br>             *Lady Aioki <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showPrevMessage?topicID=178.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showNextMessage?topicID=178.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=6><img src=http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/Reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.threadControl?topicID=178.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=178.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=178.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themissednotefrm15">SEE the Missed Note<option value="themissednotethetavern">The Tavern<option value="themissednotethestage">The Stage<option value="themissednotetidbits">Tidbits<option value="themissednotetantrums">Tantrums  <option value="themissednotefrm11">Just for fun!<option value="themissednoteguildlinks">Links<option value="themissednotethepartyforum">The Party Forum<option value="themissednotetradesevents">Trades & Events<option value="themissednotetesting">Testing<option value="themissednotefrm12">Ghost thread</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage>The Stage</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
