<br>
I had just logged on (I'm still recovering from the welcome back Dolumar party) in the Misty Thicket and started to see /ooc messages from a gnome (that I have met there in my alt Rashane) To a person named Maillena(Hope I spelled that right) and her replys to him had the tone of please leave me alone but he kept up the bannter until Mail Said &quot;Enough!!!! I will take your challange you have insulted me and I will duel you because you have questioned my Honor!&quot; Well Said Gnome told her &quot;You don't want to mess with me I'll kill you I can hit you for 80+ damage&quot;.(he was in anon mode so we couldn't see his lv). Mail said &quot;You have brought my honor into question I will duel you&quot; so he hohumed around and said he would fight her after she called him a chicken hehehe! but he would pick the place. Well he picked the place about 15 feet from the gaurds and hit her with snare and promptly died at the hands of the gaurds Hehehehe! After he came back and retreived his loot from his corpse they moved out in further away from the wall and He pulled the same thing again, he hit her with snare and she walked up and hit him twice with a war Hammer for some pretty good damage. Well the gnome hit her with all his spells and didn't dent her hp. She even let him med!!!!!<br>
After about 5 min he said /say Screw this! and Ran. I told Maillena to follow him and finish the job but she said no he had 2 chances to kill her tonight but she would not lower herself to his lv. and besides she didn't want to commit murder. If you find you are around this Prospective Member Say Hi she is one class act and she has 2 thumbs up from me!!!!<br>

Giblin the gnome is a very evil person who thinks that it is fun to pick one person from a race and tear them apart. He decided to choose me and I decided to stand up to him for my honor (which is important to me) was challanged. I swore to fight him honorably and he stated to me in a tell that he would not use any spells against me above lvl 4, seeing how he was 6 lvls my senior. Well, we know what happens when an evil person swears something, they do the oppisite. He tried to hit me with dot spells that according to him deal 200+ and he did not hurt me at all. I tried to explain to him that when Evil battles Good that Evil must realize that when one has the blessings of the Gods upon them, they have a breater chance of success.<br>
<br>
Giblin decided to scream foul once the duels were over and Neao stood in defense of my honor. He also stayed behind when I went to the city to explain to everyone that yes I had won the duel even though teh message stated that Giblin had won. He informed everyone that Giblin had run off and that I was the true winner.<br>
<br>
In fact the side of Good was the true winner that eve. I am just very proud to have had a good friend by my side during the entire event.<br>
<br>
Thank Thee most kindly Neao for your friendship and your support, you will never know what it means to me.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
