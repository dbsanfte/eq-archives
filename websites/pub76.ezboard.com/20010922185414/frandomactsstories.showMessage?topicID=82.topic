<br>
1. Make a 'Healing...' hotkey. To do this: click on 'socials'. then click over to page two. Click on one of the empty ones to where it opens up on the middle section there (does that part have a name? where all the chat stuff is? the chat-section?). 1st line is Incoming Heal on %T, or something to that effect. (I think you just have to have that, and not /gsay in front, but its much to early for me to remember.) Some folks make it cutesy, others just Healing Target, but make it saying Healing and who you are healing for sure. More on why later. 2nd line is /cast 1 (where 1-8 is the spell slot that your heal spell is located in) I myself *always* keep heal in the top slot, and my heal hotkey on the 1st hotkey slot. It seems its easiest to get to there, and if i moved it I would snare my group *alot* more. <br>
<br>
Now as to the reasoning behind this. If your group has 2 or even 3 healers, as a tank's health is dropping, if no one has this key set up, all 3 could cast heal at the same time, thus wasting that mana. Now some folks set up hotkeys like this for all of their spells. I think that's more of a personal choice. I think Heal is the most important one to have set up like this, the others are optional.<br>
<br>
2. Now this one is for no one in particualar, but stems from Tellia talking about one of the druids in her group the other night. If you have heal, use it. If you are one of the classes listed above, and you join a group, and you are the *only* class from the ones listed up there, you are the healer. Really I don't think that applies to anyone within the guild, but its good advice for those wanting to play a 'healing' class.<br>
<br>
Random advice from that same incident: If you find yourself in a group where the healer doesnt know when to heal you need to let them know to heal. Usually this will be druids, as shaman/clerics have been healing most of their careers. Druids can solo very well their whole lifes, so sometimes they err on the side of clueless in a group setting. The best way to do this is make a hotkey &quot;HEY!!! Heal me NOW!!&quot; or something to that effect (being nice is all good and well and very Random Acts of us, but a healer not doing his/her job is just wrong). <br>
<br>
The reverse is also true. After you lay down two or three heals and every mob the tank brought is frothing mad at you, it is your thier job to get said mobs off of you quickly and effeciently. Healers should have a hotkey for when this happens, something to the effect of 'HEY!! I can't cast while being *BEAT* on!! (this doesnt have much use if you are in good groups a lot, as most good players know after a heal to watch the healer). You can make one of those with %T in it, where you would target what was beating on you, but often its hard enough to just take a beating and not freak out without trying to target something. Which brings me to my third point.<br>
<br>
3. If you drop a major heal or two and said mobs grow...distressed at you and start to show you how upset they are by beating you silly, DONT run around. Just don't do it. Let the tanks know you have some unfriendly beasts chewing you and stand there till they take care of them. If you run around (and druids are *really* guilty of this, as when soloing if something is hitting us, it means its time to run further and cast something) you make it all that much harder for your tank friends to get those mobs off you. Now, that's not to say if your health is dropping fast and you are pretty sure its going to be 'Loading' time soon, dont run like a *cough* druid, but take a few hits. Give those 'meat-shields' some time to do their thing and get the beastly stuff off of you. Root also does wonders in situations like this. If your group doesnt have a chanter, root stuff that seems to like you better than the big mean fellow with the sword.<br>
<br>

And that's all this goofy druid has this morning.<br>

<br>
The only footnote about running around is this...<br>
<br>
If you know how to run around CONSTRUCTIVELY, do so. If the group whines at you, ignore them. However, very very few people know how to do this constructively (I can say this with vast experience heh).<br>
<br>
Here are some pointers...<br>
<br>
1. If the mob is not snared, or you do not have root, there is NO constructive way to run it around. End of story.<br>
<br>
2. If you have root, running something off to one side and rooting it is a good way to &quot;ghetto mez&quot;. Gets it off you, doesn't make the tanks rescue you, everyones happy.<br>
<br>
3. If you are outdoors (and, in very special places, indoors) and know how to short kite, you can do so to help hold something off the party until a tank can get it off you. The main thing to keep in mind while &quot;short kiting&quot; (as I've dubbed it) is to always stay within casting distance of the party.<br>
<br>
I make frequent use of short kiting while playing my Necromancer. Drop a Darkness (snare for Necros) and run it in small circles around the party. Using this method I can get time to cast on what the party is fighting as well as what I'm kiting and I'm never out of range for casts (such as heals <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
As for indoor kiting, this is very specific to where you're at. I've only found a few very specific rooms where kiting is an option. One such room is the &quot;Bar&quot; in Soluseks Eye. As I showed Gaffan &amp; Tchallar last night, you can hop back and forth across the bar and the mob follows a set path to you either way. So, with a little timing, you can quite easily keep a mob running back and forth and never let it hit you. BUT, I would NOT advise doing this unless you know exactly how to do so in the place where you are.<br>
<br>

But Gaffan and Balamur both made very applicable replies. Yesterday though with that Oogowomp (?) guy on me, couldn't root or snare, and if I stood still too long to let Varigon try and taunt him off of me, I'd be dead, hehehe. Varigon had already used Lay on Hands and Gorte completely healed me a couple of times, but I was still down to about 40 hp when Aldrec popped back in and helped get him off of me and they killed him. Whew.<br>

I need to check the ingredients of my Ensnaring Root spell or something cause I notice that it's mostly resisted and if it does take it only stays on for way too short a time. <p><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color="#990099">Meriel

It also depends on your skill in that magic category (Abjuration, etc).<br>
<br>
Beyond that, ensnaring roots just doesn't work that well, at least not compared to plain old snare or ensnare.  Snare is probably the best spell in the game next to SoW.  Slows them down, keeps them from running off to get their buddies (very good with Sarnaks!), and just generally makes life easier.  All that for not very much mana at all.<br>
<br>
If something's beating on you, if you snare it, you can run it around in a little circle near the group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Works good for me anyway.  So does dodging about a little bit and backing up just enough to give the tanks a chance to get it off you.

Clerics, Healers, and all casters --PLEASE MAKE A HOT KEY TO TELL THE TANK YOU ARE BEING ATTACKED-- No tank worth while will be offended by this.  Recently the Company(tm) has been hanging out in Sol A.  If you have never been there it can get real Crowded real quick with mobs.  The Tank will already be jumping from one target to another and literally doesnt have time to look at the health bars.  It is very important to tell the tank what is happening around him/her.  Tanks are always focused on making sure the one in front of them doesnt leave them.  As I get higher in levels I have noticed more and more that I have a hard time glancing at the Group Bar to find out how everyone is doing... Remember Pallys have to taunt, bash, and cast to be effective.  That takes alot of concentration to do it all.  Again, Please make that hot key.  The only time I will ignore it is if the Wiz or Druid in the group is casting Evac.  When that happens I will protect them, while hoping the Healer/Caster can take the punishment long enough, as it is the only way the group will have a chance to survive <br>
                 <br>
  As a Pally I have learned to use Root as the most powerful taunt tool I have.  The only problem with that is if another wonders too close to what I have rooted after I ran off to taunt another mob off another party member, if this happens  they will be whacked.  One of the jobs of the casters and of the healers to be aware of what else is in the room, or is coming into the room.   Last night I made a fatal error in saying we could take a fight, when Evac was called for.  Too late I realized I was way off and the entire group (save one very smart mage who gated as we were falling) died.  The Groups death was solely on me for arguing that we could take it.   So Tanks .. please listen to your Healers/Casters... They will and do see things  you are not aware of.  As with everything else, we learn by trial and error.<br>

  I know this went a little in to the tanks view, but I thought it would fit the post.<br>

Now that I've got Sabinne, I'm starting to learn about this casting stuff. Since I've only played a Tank up til now, I've been clueless.<br>
From a tank's point of view, I agree with Gaffan about running around. It is really hard to get a good slash on a target that is moving. I know I haven't hit on many big boys yet but even with something that is yellow to me, if I can get a good few smacks on it and several taunts, many times it will switch to me.<br>
Most everyone has been playing MUCH longer than I but it also seems that many times the wizards, etc. want to join in the fight too early and with a nice spell, the target goes straight to them and is harder to taunt off. I read in one of the Tank guidebooks that a Tank should ask his casters to hold off until he(the tank)has had enough time to do some damage and keep it's attention then they can smack it around and finish it off without it turning on them.<br>
