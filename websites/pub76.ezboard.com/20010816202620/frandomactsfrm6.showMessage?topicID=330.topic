Seems to be the best Guild in Norath! Won't apply yet as I must respect the moratorium on new membership till August.  Sending this note to see if any of you are currently hunting in the unrest area, as one of the prerequirements is to try and group with someone in the guild. Have been imposing on some of you the last day or so and sending you tells with questions! Hystrom, if you read this note, a particular thanks you to you as I bent your ear for quite some time and you were most helpful! Don't know what you were doing but you stopped doing it to help me! My Thanks!  Was in unrest this AM and happened to group with a 17 druid who was eagerly awaiting 19 and his port spells. Was a bit dismayed when I told him he could not get any of his new spells the usual way! Asked if he had his port spell to the commons yet and he said he did not.  So. I ported over and got it for him. Did so willingly and not just because of my desire to join you folks, however, to get off on the right foot i'm relaying the info! Need to find a sponsor and im not sure if any of you are hunting near me! A cry for help!  Anyway, I will review the board again, especially the fledgeling quest area, but in the meantime any tips or pointers are always appreciated! Hope to talk or hear from ya soon! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uamerygnmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AmerygnMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#006400>(7/15/01 3:28:51 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hoping to join You!</span><hr size=1> Tuvok,<br>

What class/level are you?  There's folks with mains and alts all over the scale.  We have a bunch of 20-something folks running around Kunark these days, and some upper-20s/low-30s folks in Mistmoore.  Others all over the place, and some of us (/wave Shalindar) travel a lot anyway.<br>
<br>
I actually intend to hit Unrest shortly myself - there's some skellies in the basement with something I need. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm a bard, newly 25th, in Kunark as I write this but needing to scoot up to Kelethin and do some training.<br>

I was hoping for it! Did not want my post to sound like an &quot;official&quot; application due to your moritorium! Don't want to break a rule b4 I even get in! However, it surely can be an official request if you folks see it that way. Anyhow, level 20 Druid is where I'm at. Surely no expert but love the concept of your guild. Play pretty much every day but only for 2 hours.  4:30 to 5:30 and 8:30 to 9:30 East coast usa time.  Weekends can alter that schedule as I will venture into Norath at every opportunity! And, no expert in the game either although i'm on Allah every day reading something. And now, I'll be a frequent visitor here! So, thx again for the reply and I'll be waiting to hear back. If your gonna be in town I'd like to make every attempt to meet ya and say hi!  Thx!  You folks all seem soooo nice! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/brandomacts.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tuvok>Tuvok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#006400>(7/16/01 3:22:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hoping to join You!</span><hr size=1> Anyone planning on being in Unrest, Kelethin, CB, or Butcher Block around 4:30 East Coast time today? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uamerygnmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AmerygnMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#006400>(7/16/01 7:33:02 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hoping to join You!</span><hr size=1> Tuvok,<br>

Sounds great! I've been hunting Unrest for several weeks now myself! So, what were ya doing in GFay yesterday? I'm sure, like me, looking for the endangered species - The true Newbie!  Getting lots of replies to my tells but, as I was warned - No true Newbies! When I met you yesterday I had just rcd a reply from a lvl 12 Monk! Newbie? I think not! Grouping sounds great! I find the higher in level I get the harder it seems to find my style of group! Been playing for awhile, however just started grouping recently. Really enjoy it as We can take on so much more with a good group. As a Druid I find it difficult to solo in Unrest. Blues are hard to find and it's a rare green that yields exp! Plenty of Red but they are not doable for me solo! Anyway, the chance to group with a 19 warrior is fantastic. My best buddy sometimes hunts with me and he's a 17 Ranger so that will only help us. My biggest problem is hunt time. On the East coast and play from 430 to 530 and then again 830 to 930. Where you at and when do ya hunt? I really would LOVE to group with ya! Kinda help each other as we strive to become members of the best guild in Norath! With your sword and my Mana we seem a match made in Norath Heaven! Drifting a bit, where ya at, real world? Hunt times? (usually) How many Characters? Highest? Favorite? I've got 3 but pretty much adventure exclusively now as Tuvok. With so darn little hunt time I want to maximize my efforts! Nuff said! This post is getting to long! Hope to hear from ya soon and, perhaps, even group with ya later today! Oh, one more thing - Were you in Unrest last night? What did ya think of that raiding party? Wow! First time I saw one live. Can't even imagine what fun they had in there! Probably cleared the Zone! Talk later! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/utruyth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truyth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#006400>(7/18/01 3:49:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hoping to join You!</span><hr size=1> I had just meet Tuvok today while waiting for Dolumar to pick me up in Butcherblock, and all I can say is this druid is a very nice person.

Was surprised to see you there when I ported in to unload my loot! I've been looking like crazy to meet some of you folks and doesn't it just figure when I really wasn't looking - There you were! You certainly continued the amazing streak of truly nice people I've met in the past week or so in this guild! In a world this large one certainly expects to meet all kinds of folks. Some real nice, most ok, and then the others! But, I must say that everyone of you that I have found and sent a tell to have responded in most positve fashion! I can wel imagine that a tell from &quot;nowhere&quot; might find you in a difficult situation. At the very least you certainly are doing something! Yet every one of you has responded! All very helpful and encouraging to the point of really going out of your way to establish a real relationship.  I spent a couple of hours on Allah reading about many guilds on MT before deciding to try and join you all.  Sure seems like my time was EXTREMELY well spent! I will continue my quest to find that elusive newbie and certainly hope to be able to apply for membership in August!
