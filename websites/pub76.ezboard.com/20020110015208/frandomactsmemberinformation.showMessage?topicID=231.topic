He pulled a wad of dirty bandages from his backpack and began to bind the cuts and gashes that the young kodiak had used to decorate his torso.  It was another close call.  One of many that he had endured recently.  &quot;The reward will justify the risks,&quot; he muttered to himself.  He put up the strips of dirty cloth when he was satisfied that most of the flow of blood had been staunched.  The young sorcerer gingerly leaned back against the end.  He pulled his spell book from his pack.  The smell and the squeak from the shiny, fresh leather binding reminded him how new the book was.  The man fought to concentrate on the magical glyphs and sygils that flowed across the first few pages of the book.  &quot;How ironic,&quot; he mused.  There was a time when he had a book that was so weather beaten and broke in from use that the cover swung silently open, the worn and yellowed pages smelled of campfires and short ale combined with a slight, but distinguishable funk of burnt ogre flesh acquired form The Overthere, that he was never quite able to wash away.  Concentration began to wane as the memories of his life and friends began to pass over him again...<br>
<br>
<br>
I, Maitlin, appeared in Freeport and introduced myself to the very first person I saw, Varigon.  Varigon, a paladin of Marr and me, the newest wizard of Solusek Ro were soon inseperable.  We learned the layout of the city of Freeport together and began to murder many innocent rats, bats and deaying skeletons outside the West Gate of the giant city.  Varigon saved my life numerous times during these early years.  I will never forget him for that.  As we grew up together, we moved on to increasingly more dangerous areas.  We met a friendly cleric, Relin, in Befallen and had a wonderful time destroying Lrod the skeleton.  One day, out of curiosity, I wanted to look down the well behind Lrod and see if I could see down.  Varigon told me I was not the brightest individual for doing it, but I jumped on the edge and looked in anyway.  As fate would have it I tripped and fell to my death at the bottom.  Good old Varigon thought that he could save me since he had a far greater constitution then I, and jumped in to try to retreive my corpse.  Needless to say we were young and very lucky.  A wandering group of people much older then ourselve pulled out bodies to safety.  We laughed about this for many years after that.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maitlin, this is Meriel and her friend Gorte,&quot; Varigon told me.  I wasn't sure how he had met them at the time, but who really cares?  They were both terrific people.  Little did I know that this would be a pivotal moment in my life and create a loyalty and realtionship that would last for ever.  Even beyond the grave.  <br>
<br>
The four of us began to wreak havock on the orcs in Oasis of Marr.  What a blast we had.  Gorte and Meriel asked Varigon and I to join their guild, Random Acts.  Of course we accepted.  After all, if these two were in the guild, it had to be full of good people.  Karal accepeted us to the fold and a placed the banner of Random Acts behind our names.  We had a huge drunken party outside of the bank in North Freeport.  Thank Solusek we weren't arrested for public drunk.   We soon found out that we were right.  The guild WAS full of great people Neaoh, Gaffan,Dolumar, Hamadryad, Azariel and many others to numerous to name.  Leldara, Laninie and Finrael became very close friends.  One of my most vivd memories of this time of my life, was the time that some Random Act family members had problems in Befallen also.  Their corpses were stuck on the third level and they had no keys to get out.  The call went out and Befallen was swarming with people from RA.  I don't think there was a Random Acts family member anywhere that wasn't in Befallen.  It was really a blast.  I remember that most of us were too young and weak to fight our way down there.  We settled on a frontal assault method.  We dove down the well in a flood.  The meat shields went first, and the casters right after.  The first time was a holocaust.  I believe all of us died.  This is where I met Kizor and I believe Finrael was there.  Kizor and I down the well at the same time.  We did the brilliant dive down the well again, this time with the catsers going first.  Luckily as casters we still have our major weapons, our spells, even when naked.  The meat shields are not that lucky.  They had to try to loot their weapons as we started to blast.  We pulled it off this time and managed to save our friends.  There was a party atmosphere because I beleive a lot of us doubted that we could accomplish this.  That is the night that the true character of RA was revealed to me.  People diving down a hole into something that they were 95% sure would kill them all to try to save their friends.<br>
I am proud to be one of them.<br>
<br>
I remember when I was promoted to the 20th nuke by the wizard's guild, I decided it was time to go on a quest for the Staff of the Wheel.  The troubles that were had getting that were numerous, but many people helped me and many people died in the process.  The trip to lower Guk was the killer.  Slovine, Balmere and I all died at least once.  Thanks for the res's Bal!  Merial, Ledara, Razgum and Varigon all helped at different stages of the quest too.  I hope they all know how mush I appreciate that.  If doind this insane quest wasn't bad enough for these people, Slovine, Legolaas, Meriel and I all journied to Lower Guk again to help Laninie get hers.  Man, this group is full of gluttons for punishment!<br>
<br>
Some of the fondest memories I have are of sitting on a ledge in Lake of Ill Omen with Meriel, Gorte and Varigon.  Many people joined the group off and on at this time, including Laninie, Finrael and a warrior that I forget the name of, but he reminded me alot of Balamere.  He, in fact, was the one that coined the term Meriel and Co. tm.  We cooked a number of baddies and had a great time.  We graduated to giants soon after that.  Then we made some small forays to Vellious.<br>
<br>
All throught his time, another firend I had was Laninie.  She was always ready to traipse out into the boonies to nuke some monster.  She helped with finding runes and helped me get a number of neat magic items.  I'll never forget that.<br>
I owe her alot.  She was always a step ahead of me on leveling so was an accurate guide on where to hunt and what to hunt.<br>
<br>
I remember chatting about tailoring with Gaffan all night long.  We would sit and b*tch together about how impossible the trade of tailoring was beyond a certain point.  It bacame almost impossible to find materials.  It was nice to know that someone else was going through the same frustration.  Thanks, Gaffan!  I think we both agreed the best part of tailoring was the need for Heady Kiolas.  It forced you to raise brewing and alcohol tolerance! <br>
<br>
I still smile when I think of the night that Gwion was teleporting Mer, Var, G and I to the Karanas.  I was whacked by a bear in that stinkin' druid ring and those stupid druids kiled me for defending myself... TWICE!  The run from Qeynos was long and cold while naked.  Good old, Meriel gated in and gave me puupy feet to run back.  Gwion pulled my stuff from my corpse and was holding it for me a the bridge.  To this day, I'll never forget Gwion defiling my Stein of Maggok.  I never drank beer from it again.  Looks too much like what Gwion put in it.  Oh she says she was kidding... but I know better.  <br>
<br>
I remember being asked about my realtionship with my god Solusek Ro and my lack of worship and reverance.  My answer was always the same.  I always told people the same thing, &quot;Solusek and I have an agreement.  He gives me power and I stay out of his temple and pretty much ignore him.&quot;  I believe everyone thought it was a joke.  Unfortunately it wasn't. <br>
<br>
This lead to my most unpleasant memory.  It had to be my last day in Norrath.  I had broken my promise to Solusek one too many times.  I entered that stupid temple against my better judgement around a half a dozen times.  Old Sol finally laid his foot down.  I had reached the 30th nuke in the guild and he told me hat he needed me to come to his realm and work for him. I knew I had no choice.  I gave everything away that I possibly could to my friends.  I had a plan to feed myself to Vox but my friends and I decided that was not a good idea because she could summon others in the zone.  We finally agreed on an acceptable end to my life.  Lego, Var, Mer and Gorte were with me in Permafrost.  V was kicked from the world and could not come back.  Mer teleported the 4 of us that were left after we finally gave up on V to Lavastorm.  She didn't really want to watch what was aout to happen so I said good bye to her and Lego and watched them port away.  Gorte and I were all that were left now.  I saud good bye to my little buddy, levitated out over the huge pit of lava in front of the temple, waved at my friend and cancelled the levitate.  I was surprised how long I could swim in lava.  I did shortly die and pass on to my god however.<br>
<br>
Spending time with Solusek was interesting to say the least.  I think I began to annoy him after awhile.  My friends always told me that I have a gift to annoy people.  Sol finally snapped.  He told me that he had made a mistake and I had to go back.  He said that I must get some stupid wand or staff or something that many people know as an epic weapon.  He said that he wanted to delay seeing me so much that he was sending me back without the skills I had before!  So, I ended up in Freeport a second time.  Luckily, my friends were happy to see me and gave me a number of gifts to get started again.  I have a long row to hoe, but I will be a part of Meriel and Co. tm again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The young wizard stretched his lombs and stood up.  He had a lot of work to do.  <br>

I appreciate you sharing the fascinating story of your life with us. My name is Miriel and I'm a bard of the 18th song. Once you are up to it I would be honoured to share some adventures with you. Your reputation has preceded you. I doubt it will take you long to catch up with me since I tend to advance slowly. I guess the bardic guild and I just have different opinions about what is a good tale to tell. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table>

Hehe I still have my wizzy, sort've in honor to you hehe... you remember Kaitlynn? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And that warrior was Aldrec, the crazy fool who kept saying &quot;Stop worrying we'll be ok&quot;... I think that's required for warriors though (right Meriel? &quot;Should we run&quot; &quot;I think we're ok&quot; ... &quot;Ok you run it's too late for me&quot; heheh).<br>
<br>
I haven't played in awhile Mait, got really tired of the place. Maybe I'll come back just to harass you, because you coming back surely means Meriel &amp; Co Alts, a fully owned subsidiary of Merial &amp; Co INC, will probably be out in force. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
