<br>
We have grown as a guild--and will continue to grow because we<br>
have something that other people want: friendship and kindness.<br>
There is not enough of that in Norrath--or any other world!<br>
<br>
Lately we have begun to notice a lot of new faces and names,<br>
and our family doesn't seem as close-knit and &quot;cosy&quot; as it did in the <br>
beginning. It's really good for us to talk about how we feel about<br>
this rather than just run away and stop playing our guild<br>
characters when we feel a little lost or left out. Also, talking<br>
about it gets us all thinking about what we can do to fix it. <br>
<br>
Take heart dear friends--it is nowhere near hopeless. There <br>
are a lot of things we can do. I suggest here and now that <br>
we start trying a few things at a time and seeing how we like them.<br>
<br>
In another message here we talk about Guild Raids and Hunting--<br>
that is something that will help us stay in contact with each other <br>
while hunting. And there are many other things we can do.<br>
<br>
Lets start with some Guild-Only Events. I have a couple of <br>
ideas I want to suggest here and I hope you will add your <br>
ideas here:<br>
<br>
Idea: Surnaming Party! Once or twice a month we could have a <br>
party for those people who have reached level 20 and are entitled to <br>
a surname. Some people might even wait and put their surname on <br>
at the party. Some people might want to come to the party and have <br>
their guildmates help them find the perfect surname--or if they already <br>
know the name they want, we could have a contest to see if anyone <br>
can guess it (with hints provided).  And we could all tell the stories<br>
behind our names. There are other things we<br>
could do with this Surnaming Party too.<br>
<br>
Idea: Fledgling Meet and Greet! Once or twice a month we could have <br>
a party to meet and greet all the people who have joined Random Acts <br>
since the last party. Fledglings would be encouraged to come with stories <br>
about their character, their travels in Norrath, and their most memorable <br>
moments (great idea Jellybean!). Regular members would be able to put a <br>
face to those new names--and a personality too! This would also be a <br>
great place to get drunk!<br>
<br>
Idea: Celebrity Roast! Once a month we could pick a few members of <br>
Random Acts and toast and roast them just like they do at those <br>
celebrity roasts! People would tell their stories about the members and <br>
we'd all have a good laugh. Another good place to get drunk!<br>
<br>
Idea: Guild Swap Meet! Once a month we could all bring whatever we<br>
have been saving in the bank and swap and trade with other guild members.<br>
<br>
Idea: Trade Skills Party! Come and teach a trade to other guild members--<br>
show them where to buy supplies, how to make items and in what order, <br>
how much to sell them for and so on. I remember in the beginning, Tindar <br>
kept telling everyone he was practicing a certain trade skill so if we needed <br>
something we could all go to him for it! As time went by, he kept adding <br>
more and more trade skills. I was wondering if he was going to have time <br>
for anything else there for awhile! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
I myself have practiced many trade skills in the year and a half I've been <br>
playing Everquest including jewelrycraft, blacksmithing, baking, tailoring, <br>
and a mastery of pottery. I don't do trade skills now as much as I used to <br>
but I would be happy to share my knowledge at an event. It would be a<br>
lot easier to share these skills at an event rather than while we<br>
are trying to hunt or raid dungeons, so I think this event would be very useful.<br>
When I was playing an Enchanter I went to an Enchanter Meeting<br>
held on one of the older servers. The Enchanter who called the <br>
meeting spent an hour or more teaching younger <br>
Enchanter about the skill of jewelrycraft, what order to make jewelry in, <br>
and what is fair to charge for your wares. I really appreciated it. Perhaps <br>
after we have done something like this for our members, we could also do <br>
something like this as a Server-wide Guild event.<br>
<br>
Idea: First Aid Camp for Guild-Members only! Lets do for our Fledglings<br>
and Lower-level members what we have been doing for everyone else!<br>
<br>
Okay folkes! There's some grist for the mill! Let's spend this month<br>
concentrating on what we can do for our guildmembers<br>
and ourselves. We already have had many more server-wide events<br>
than most guilds have in a year. Once we feel we all know each other<br>
a lot better, then we can start having server-wide events again.<br>
<br>
Please voice your opinion here of what event we should have first--<br>
and how you would like to see it happen! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I like them all.  The only requirement I have for the surnaming party is that Grimmy, poet in disguise, has to attend <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   He's a one-man surname generator (ask him for one sometime if you don't believe me).<br>
<br>
For the first event, however, I suggest a combination swap meet/fledgling meet and greet.  I've got a TON of stuff in the bank that I've been saving for &quot;newbies&quot; -- without realizing that my own guildmembers could use some of it too!  Doh!<br>
<br>
And there are plenty of new people I've never met, that I want to meet. I can't wait!<br>
<br>
Where can we have it where we won't be constantly interrupted, and where all members can go?  The only place I can think of is the tunnel in East Commons -- guys, help me out if you can think of a better spot.<br>

you will need to look back in old messages but i know that location is in there somewhere i will look around for it and tell you what heading its under.<br>

    Here some of mine, not the best ideas, but might work...hehe.<br>
<br>
1)  I remember reading a post about the guildhouse in Freeport.  Well, I was thinking of having guild business there, such as issues that may require voting and sorts.  However, when business is done, we can hop over to the Freeport arena and start having a good time there in which we can use a lot of your ideas like teaching languages, help each other in trade skills (telling them basics of that skill), even have contests.  Contests would be great in the arena such as a guild tournament of sorts so we can showcase our powers that use so often in hunting.  Maybe have a sort of Olympic kind of event (might be better if we use this later to get the whole world involved, but have us sponsor it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) ).  Point being, a PvP area would be great to hold events because of the flexibilty they offer and the Freeport arena is best b/c of the desired guildhouse location.  Too avoid the bad people from killing us in the arena we will have designated people look after the place such as having see invis on and such.<br>
<br>
2)  Start guild only player run quests.  This will help us get to know each other better, also make it more interesting and something we can learn from.  <br>
<br>
3)  This was started in Rallos Zek, but it can definitely start on Morrel-Thule.  Try and form a NATO sort of organization to help newbies all over the place.  It will be consisted of many guilds or however many we want.  This will really help spread OUR WORDS and KINDNESS to the world.<br>
<br>
I'm blank now, so more might pop up later...hehe.  Take care all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> KizorCobaaca</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#006400>(8/2/00 10:26:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Guild House</span><hr size=1> I think this guild house thing is a great idea, and i <br>
think we should get movin on it cuz i just can't stand<br>
it much longer.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Also i think the Fledgling/swap meet would be a wonderful idea for the first guild only event.  A+ for you for thinkin of that one.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
We should definately have it in the Guild House in Freeport, that would be the greatest.<br>
