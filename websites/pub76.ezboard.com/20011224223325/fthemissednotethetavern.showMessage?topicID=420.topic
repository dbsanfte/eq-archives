<br>
Yes, this is long and has been edited for the main thrust of the story. Any section not marked with an author was done by me.<br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Darkmask enters the Missed Note early in the morning, when the dew was still fresh on the grass in the commonlands, not a beast was stirring, only Harte was quietly working behind the bar arranging bottles for the day.<br>
&quot; Hail Harte Greyeagle &quot; Darkmask said with a grain to his voice. Darkmask digs into his backpack removing a key to a room above, and lays on the bar, &quot; I need to return this to you, I wont be needing it, I wont be staying here any longer, it is time for me to go &quot; <br>
Harte looked up at the High Elf whose eyes were bloodshot, and tears streamed down his face, Harte spook with confidence as he said &quot; Well dont be silly Darkmask, you can hold the key for when you get back, I wont rent out your room &quot;<br>
&quot; You dont understand &quot; Darkmask said &quot; I am not coming back, ever &quot; and he pushed the key with one finger towards Harte, who looked up at the enchanter, and raised his eyebrows in a concerned manner. Harte spoke softly and said &quot; Do you need to talk about anything..anything at all, I am here for you, here let me get you a drink, we should talk &quot;<br>
Darkmask stiffened &quot; No &quot; and looked the half elf in his green eyes &quot; I am done, finished, my heart is turned cold, my soul has rotted, I am burnt within &quot;<br>
&quot; Darkmask, we not have always agreed on things, but I wouldnt want to see you leave, neither would many of our regulars, alot of people have come to expect you and look forward to seeing you &quot; Harte with as much heartful compassion he could find.<br>
&quot; Its too late Harte, its too late, when you cry everytime you enter Norrath, and you feel that all the goodness that once swept beneath your feet when you walked has been sucked out, that all that joy you had, is gone, all you have come to know has slipped through your fingertips, it is time to slip with it, Harte I am not well, my heart is weak, I am going away....away to die in peace, away from the crowded tavern, away from the notions of hateful people, away from it all, I want the world to be silent the day I die, nothing can stop this...noone can stop this &quot;<br>
Harte dropped his bar rag, and almost dropped the bottle of elven wine &quot; I....I....I dont know what to say &quot; as Darkmask picked the key up, and placed it on the rack behind him.<br>
&quot; Say nothing, I want to be alone, I have to be.... &quot; Darkmask said as he turned his head, and walked out the Note, sliding his hand down the door, in a moment of memories, all the times, all the people, he remembered it all, he would take it with him, but now, now he must go.<br>
&quot; Harte, just if they ask about me, tell them I love them, I really do, I carry them with me &quot; Darkmask said as he touched his heart, and vanished in bubbles of light....... <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harte stared at the spot where Darkmask had stood for a long time. It seems that Darkmask preferred the place a little quieter, maybe he longed for the days when there were very few people who visited the Note each day.<br>
Harte was certain that Darkmask wasn't longing for the days when outsiders came to the Inn and attacked Sasi's character.... that certainly wasn't fun.<br>
Harte felt sure that Darkmask didn't miss the days when the Note seemed to get burned down constantly or when everyone who came near it seemed to die.<br>
What Harte did know is that Darkmask missed Sasi. But she is still here, in the Note. Her spirit is obvious in the many stories told throughout the day, her instruments are still sitting right where she left them and most of her friends are still visiting regularly. Harte fully expected her to be back.<br>
Harte wondered where else Darkmask will find the feeling that can be found only at the Missed Note? <br>
Harte Greyeagle<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harte stood there staring and contemplating all that went on, all of it, and how Darkmask will be missed and wondered exactly he meant by dying...what was wrong he thought.....suddenly Hartes senses which were more keen then the average man smelled wild lillies breath into the room and the front door to the Note opened once again, last being closed by Darkmask, Harte looked up expecting Darkmask, but smelling the scent of a women, he was none too susprised at seeing a cloaked female figure enter with the hood over her face, as she came in, her hands went to hood and removing it, Harte was stunned, this woman was the most beautiful high elf he had ever seen, her skin was so soft looking, her lips so tempting, her eyes a deep topaz blue which Harte seemed to gaze at, her thin blonde hair swept over her face, she had high beautiful cheekbones, which were colored with a natural rosy blush, and she smiled at Harte.<br>
&quot; Sir &quot; She said &quot; I am looking for Sasi Greyeagle, I was told she could direct me to my husband Darkmask Disillusion &quot; Harte's jaw seemed to seperate from his skull entirely as he thought it hit the floor.<br>
&quot; Excuse me? &quot; He said with an odd confused expression.<br>
&quot; My husband, the enchanter Darkmask, I have come to find him and bring him home &quot; she said as she removed pristine white gloves, and walked towards Harte at the bar.... <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As Harte found his tongue, he stumbled over his words..<br>
&quot;D.. duh.... darkmask! Ahh yes, my... my lady. He has been here at the Missed Note for quite sometime. Unfortunately, I muh... must tell you that today, just this morning actually, he came to turn in his key and spoke of leaving the Note permanently.&quot;<br>
When Harte saw the look of disappointment on the High elf's fine features, he could actually feel her pain.<br>
&quot;Well my lady, some of the patrons did go after him to attempt to bring him back. You are welcome to wait here for him, for as long as you wish. Here is the key that he returned to me, you can have his room. Can I get you something to eat? to drink?&quot;<br>
Harte could not imagine how this turn of events occurred, but his curiosity was piqued.<br>
Harte Greyeagle<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harte was scanning the high elf, she was something to behold, glorius, all religious in her very presence, like she had been blessed with Tunare's soul, and Harte could feel it, he noticed the fine clothes she wore, the fines silks, she was most definately royalty, you could tell by the clothes and the way she carried herself, and the way she walked, you never saw her robe move, it was like she glided across the floor.<br>
She had turned from Harte at his response and surveyed the tavern, it was still morning and and not a patron was the downstairs. Her eyes seemed to float around the room looking at every detail, she was intesely scanning it all, and her eyes stopped at a knife sunk into overhang above the bar, her eyes floated back to Harte who had been following her every move with his eyes, he was fasincated by her, she was like an event the he couldnt take his off eyes off of. She sighed, to which Harte said &quot; Anything I can get you, I can make some eggs, or some toast, or do you want something to drink? &quot;<br>
She seemed to ignore his voice, but down the steps came a half dressed Ninou wearing nothing but a light white silk robe, Ninou not noticing the robe was open as she descended the steps and she beamed a smile at Harte who blushed suddenly. He wasnt a stranger to beautiful women, but one so sure of herself as Ninou and not embarrassed by anything always struck him as odd, but he liked her strength. The High Elven Woman looked at Ninou as she came down, and High Elven Woman looked at Harte and said &quot; I see, this is a whore house.... &quot; as the High Elf looked right back at Ninou as she was lifting a cup of warm coffee to her lips. Ninou's eye raised at the remark &quot; It is now, we were all out of whores until you walked in... &quot; Ninou shot back with smile as she turned and let the robe fall down to her shoulders as she proceeded back upstairs. The High Elven woman seemed to choke on the comment, taken aback by such brazen words and she retorted &quot; I would expect no less of a mouth on a dark skinned slave woman &quot; That comment seemed to hit Ninou, but she smirked and said &quot; You should expect more of a mouth on me, and if you are intrested come up to my room and I can show you. &quot; to which the end of her white robe vanished past the top of the steps.<br>
The High Elven Woman smirked and looked at Harte &quot; You let that type of mouthy woman in this place? &quot; Harte caught up in the moment of Ninou's quips lost control and said &quot; Yeah, we do, but I am regretting letting you in though... &quot;<br>
&quot; Why I never.. &quot; She flustered back.<br>
&quot; Aye it shows &quot; Harte bit his tounge as he knew he was being unkind, he liked the feeling, but knew it wasnt him. He heard a little giggle from upstairs at his last comment and blushed knowing he crossed the line of a host.<br>
&quot; I am sorry My'Lady &quot; Harte said apologetically as he poured her a cup of warm black coffee and reached out with it in hand towards her. &quot; Please have a seat, Vandaal will be up soon and will help me make some breakfast, I am sure you would feel better after you ate. &quot; <br>
&quot; Is Sasi Greyeagle here or coming soon &quot; in a disappointed and hopeful voice the High Elven Woman asked again.<br>
&quot; Well she is away and I am in charge &quot; Harte said as a crowd of High Elves walked in, some in armor and some in robes, all seemed to be in Royal Armor.<br>
&quot; Princess Larenina!! thank Tunare!! &quot; said one of the older High Elves in robes as he ran to the Woman at the table with Harte and kneeled.<br>
Harte's eyebrows twisted as the confusion this morning had seemed to reach its pinacle.<br>
The High Elves in Armor seemed to set themselves up at vital areas in the Note, establishing a defense. <br>
&quot; Hath thee found Lord Chel~ ? &quot; The old high elf in well decorated robes asked of the Princess.<br>
&quot; Chel~ ? &quot; Harte asked &quot; I thought you were looking for Darkmask? &quot;<br>
&quot; Indeed, Indeed one in the same, Darkmask is the name he seems to have adopted when he left the palace &quot; The old high elf said to Harte.<br>
&quot; Silence!! &quot; the Princess stood up &quot; Speak not for me Vernale! I am the Princess of the Sixth House and do not need others to speak for me, let alone to half elves! &quot; as she turned and headed towards the door &quot; Silent Watch go get the things from my husbands room! &quot; she tossed the key towards one of the guards who seemed like stone until the key was right in front of him and then his hand shot out, grabbed the key and shot back to his side, if Harte didnt pay attention he could of swore the High Elf didnt move. <br>
&quot; We are staying at a decent hotel, not a country inn, lets be off &quot; The Princess motioned as the crowded swirled around her and vanished out the door, followed by two high elves carrying five large chests as if they were weightless. Harte was a little taken aback by all this, but he threw the rag over his shoulder and walked back towards the bar.<br>
Vandaal was bouncing down the steps ready and eager to work &quot; Morning Harte! how is it going? &quot;<br>
&quot; Confusing, very confusing &quot; Harte shot back puzzled as he walked passed the swinging door into the kitchen...... <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ninou dressed slowly,while standing in front of the window. She watched as the High Elven woman strolled out of the Note in a hurry. As the woman glanced up at the window Ninou blew her a kiss and struck a provactive pose. Then she left the view of the window and finished putting on her armor. The day was hot,already sweat glistened on her dark skin. Not caring for the banded armor she normally wore she had pulled on the leather again. Grinning she winked at her reflection,loving the way the leather looked. Her tunic;well you couldnt really call it a tunic,it was just some leather straps crossed over her breasts,left hardly anything to the imagination. She was in a very playful mood today,no nightmares had tormented her through the night. Besides,she didnt kill a man yesterday....this day would be good. Once again her thoughts strayed to Darkmask,wondering where the enchanter was...how he was doing.<br>
Frowning she shook her head and attached her cleaver to her belt. As she came down the stairs,she flashed Harte a dazzling smile. One that truly lit up her face,she giggled and leaned across the counter. &quot;So,who was M'Lady Goody Goody and her half-wit drones?&quot; She asked throwing a wink his way.<br>
Harte smiled at the wink but then his brow wrinkled in confusion,&quot;Said her name was Princess Larenina,&quot; Harte's green eyes eyed Ninou for a moment before he continued to speak. &quot;Darkmask's wife.&quot;<br>
Ninou sat up and raised her eyebrows,&quot;Wife?&quot; She frowned,&quot;I didnt know the Ol' High Elf was married,more or less to a Princess.&quot; She slightly frowned her eyes drifting off in thought. Then shaking her head as if trying to get rid of her thoughts she once again smiled the rare smile. &quot;So handsome,I guess I'm the last remaining Barmaid?&quot; <br>
Harte nodded and handed her a tray,a smile tugging at his mouth as she groaned taking it. He was silent this morning,as if his thoughts too were clouded around something out of his grasp. Ninou leaned forward and let her lips brush his cheek. &quot;Get your head out of the gutter man,oh and Harte?&quot; He turned to look at her his hand placed where her lips had been. Ninou grinned,her bright green eyes twinkling,&quot;Hope you liked my robe!&quot; She winked and walked away her hips moving teasingly as she walked.....<br>
Ninou<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harte chuckled as Ninou walked away to tend the tables.<br>
He enjoyed the game and a little bit of flirting was always fun, but to ever fall for one so bent on working her charms for attention he knew to be a huge mistake. Harte preferred a more sensitive woman, one that would only have eyes for him and leave no man, friend or foe, ever considering an opportunity to take her from him.<br>
He enjoyed watching Ninou work the men and even more so, he laughed at how the men all fell for it. Harte would keep both Mye and Ninou as barmaids for as long as they'd stay, for they surely added to the Note. <br>
For him, there must be someone, something more. <br>
Harte Greyeagle<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ninou wiped the sweat from her forhead and glanced around the busy tavern. Since Mye had left to find her husband she was stuck with all the work. Frowning she plucked up a shot glass from her tray and downed it. The warm sting made her sigh. She missed the old days when she would get sloshed out of her mind.....it had been awhile. Picking up another she finished it off then continued her rounds. By the end of the evening she had a glazed look in her eyes and she had become more flirtatous then usual. Her giggles echoing through the Note as she passed out drinks,once in awhile taking a drink of her own. Once the Note had settled down some she leaned against the bar. Barely able to hold her own self up...few noticed her condition. Mostly the men who grinned at each other,and whispeared to each other. Ninou laughed and sighed,she glanced at the dwindling people and tried to sit on a bar stool. Her balence off from the many drinks she had,she couldnt stay on the stool. Giggling she shruged to herself and leaned against the counter again. <br>
Out of no where a shiver ran up her spine as if she was being watched....her cat like eyes darted back and forth. <br>
Ninou<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------She watched as the Shadow Knight drunk herself to a stupor. Finding it hard to not gigle out loud along with the drunk woman. Her invisabilty allowed her to move freely along the Tavern,without being noticed. When finally Ninou returned to her drinking she moved closer to the bar. Her dark eyes sizing up the woman,and frowning. <br>
Ninou grabbed one more shot glass and tilted it up,then without notice she passed out on the bar. <br>
The Erudite Enchantress laughed silently and shook Ninou's shoulder to get her moving. Once the woman was to her feet,she helped her up the stairs to her room. Making sure Ninou was carefully tucked in bed,she left the room and said a silent prayer for the woman to rest peacfully.<br>
Coming back down the stairs she waited till the bartender turned his back and took one of the room keys from the shelf and left a gold peice on the bar. Then heading to the room she had just silently purchased for the night she unlocked the door and relocked it. Once saftly in the room she dropped her invisablity and dropped her packs on the floor near the bed. Pulling off the robe she climbed under the covers and said softly to herself,&quot;Tomorrow be along day,that be the truth!&quot; she drifted off into sleep....<br>
Maxima<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ninou stirred in the bed and blinked open her blurry eyes....<br>
&quot;How the hell did I get up here?&quot;<br>
She climbed out of the bed on unsteady legs. Hic-uping hse giggled and left the room...she was not going to bed just yet....<br>
Bouncing down the stairs she surveyed the remaining men in the tavern. A grin came to her face as she held onto the door way for suport. She winked at a table,she couldnt tell if they were locals or not....her vision was blurred. She didnt care either,a thought pulled at her mind...something familar. A feeling that she was no longer alone this night. &quot;Hmm....&quot;she giggled to herself,&quot;Whos the lucky guy?&quot; a loud hic-up escaped her mouth and she busted out laughing. Covering her mouth with her finger she whispeared to no one in particular,&quot;Shhh&quot;<br>
Then straightening up she put a hand on her hip and proceded to walk towards the bar. Her bright green eyes took on a new look.....the look of a cat hunting her prey.<br>
Ninou<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As Ninou was enjoying the drink tad too much, a rather large gentleman entered the Note, his arms were large and thick, and brow furrowed, he had the look of a warrior, and you could see all the scars and scratches on his arms, his armor was heavily dented but it could be seen that it was armor from the planes, the brown texture be no other, on his back was strapped a massive sword, and he seemed to be unaware of anything happening in the bar.<br>
Ninou staggered over to the rather large man, and she fingered his bulging arms and then patted them saying &quot; Oh so firm &quot; and the large man looked down at her and she grinned &quot; I wonder if yer the lucky one to have a taste of Ninou tonight &quot; <br>
In a gruff tone he replied &quot; I am not hungry tonight, maybe some other time &quot; To which Ninou's lips form quite a little pouting frown. He looked at her and asked &quot; Have you seen Lord Darkmask this day? &quot;<br>
&quot; My my he has become quite popular, some high elf woman wanted him too, said she was his wife ( Hiccup ) &quot; Ninou stammered back.<br>
&quot; Oh Karana! I am too late, she has come for him! &quot; He cupped his forehead. &quot; Did she take him? &quot;<br>
&quot; Goodness no, he left this morn and hasnt been seen since, come, lets go to my room and see if we can find him ( Hiccup ), he might be hiding under my sheets, lets go look! &quot; Ninou smiled, the drink had filled her head and loosened her tounge.<br>
&quot; No time woman, I need to find him, do know what direction he took off into, or where he was headed, I need to find him before she does or all is lost! &quot;<br>
&quot; I told you he's hiding under my sheets, come ( drool ) upstai ( BAM )&quot; Ninou's head slamed into the table, passed out cold.<br>
&quot; Dammit! &quot; and he got up and left the note running off towards freeport. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Vandaal turned towards the sound of Ninou's head hitting the table as she plunged into unconsciousness. I'm going to have to start charging her for drinks if she's going to get that stewed he thought to himself. As he walked over to where she sat with her head on the table, the large man she had been speaking with turned to him.<br>
He asked the direction that Darkmask had headed when he left, as well as several other questions Vandaal could not answer. Unsure whether this man was friend or foe to Darkmask, Vandaal kept a tight lip, insisting that he did not know where Darkmask had gone. The large man became increasingly agitated until Vandaal told him that he would be best off talking to Harte about it, as he would know better than most where Darkmask had set out for. This seemed to satisfy the large warrior to some extent, for he sat at a nearby table and waited, constantly fidgeting, as Vandaal headed in Harte's direction.<br>
From across the room, the large man saw Vandaal approach Harte and speak softly to him. Twice he pointed at him. As Harte headed back towards the large warrior, Vandaal headed quickly up the back stairs in search of some of the heartier warriors who frequented the Note, preparing for the worst.<br>
Vandaal <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
After a few moments,Ninou raised her head again. Rubbing her pounding temples,she blinked her eyes and glanced around. Sighing she started to rise but dizzness took her and she thought it best to stay seated. She hadnt drank this much in a long time,a slight smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. She was rather surprised she was still alone for the night. <br>
&quot;Hmm....&quot;She looked around at the last remaining people. Her eyes noticed the Warrior again,frowning she made a Tisk,Tisk sound and shook her head. &quot;No one to play with me tonight..how boring.&quot; Slowly she stood,her legs numb from the drink. &quot;Maybe...I better go to bed....alone.&quot;She breathed leaning against the counter as she walked to the stairwell.<br>
Half way up the stairs she scratched her head and took off her helmet,letting it roll back down the stairs. After a few more steps her boots were off...wiggling her toes she smiled. &quot;Much better,&quot;Leaving her boots on the stairs,&quot;I'll get them in the morning.&quot; Giggling loudly she blew a kiss at a woman coming down the stairs. Gasping the woman frowned and turned her eyes away. Ninou grinnned and shrugged,&quot;Just trying to have alittle fun darlin...&quot; she said to herself....<br>
Stopping to rest at the top of the stairs ninou held her dizzy head in her hands. &quot;Gods....all the blasted spinning!&quot; Looking at the numbers on the doors she stumbled backwards....almost falling down the stairs. Catching herself,she staggered forward,&quot;hmm..that would not have been good! (Hic-up)&quot;She giggled again. Door number 3 was open,Ninou peeked in...her eyes looking around. &quot;Hey..your door's open....better close it..too many (Hic-up) strange people out here!&quot;She shouted,then walked on to her room.<br>
At her room,she opened the door and almost fell in. Laughing she shook her head making the Tisk Tisk noise again. Forgetting to close the door,she stripped down and walked to the window. Darkness had settled through out the Commons. She could see a few people,out side of the door. Resting in the cool air of the night. Ninou sighed and stretched,her muscles flexing. Her dark skin gleamed in the lamp's light. Turning she climbed into her bed and put out the lamp. It didnt take long before she was sleeping peacfully. No dreams would wake her tonight......she was out cold. <br>
Ninou<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The campfire popped and the wood in it hissed as the small amount of water left in the wood was being seared out, it was going to be a cold night in the mountains, the wind was already whispering Karanas lullaby ( comes from an old childhood ledgend that Karana, god of the storm would sing children to sleep with a soothing wind )and the High Elf enchanter punched his pack to soften it for his head, that not doing the trick his proceeded to bang it several times on the ground....the pack, not his head. <br>
Darkmask felt the tremor in his heart, he knew his time was fast approaching when Karana would sweep his soul back into the wind. Darkmask layed down and let his eyes slide shut. As the eyelids collided over his weary eyes, images flashed in his head, all he had seen, all he felt now, the madness stirring within, the pain of his heart, all the sins of his past, he clutched his fists to his chest. His mind raced and he thought of love, all it meant to him, the past raced in front of him and he saw all the mistakes he had made, the woman he had not fought to hold on, but instead abandoned her. He was in love with....... <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Darkmask whispered the name of his true love into Karana's wind, and it lifted as the sound of the breeze took it higher and higher into the air, like the name had become a life of its own, Darkmask's eyes shut tight, his heart slowed, his pulse started falter, and he could feel the warmth drain from his body....this was his time, his god had come to take him......<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Back at the Note the two erudite sisters were disscussing matters at one of the tables, Ninou looked none too happy and Maxima just grinned like all Ninou was saying was funny as an Ogre swan diving into a river. The crowd at the note was filtering slowly but surely, and an odd figure walked in, his hood over his head, he slipped to the back corner table.<br>
Suddenly in came old Drezenal the drunken minstrel screaming about the high elf lady coming back to the note.<br>
&quot; Shes coming, and she looks angry! &quot; and he faltered threw the door. He was pushed out of the way by a high elf gaurd wearing shiney blue armor, and carrying a flaming sword, most of the people at the note recognized a soulfire, but this, this was the firey avenger, the sword of legend, the sword that only the most noble, the bravest, the most true of heart palidan may weild. And into the door came several of these guards all dressed in blue armor weilding firey avengers, it was a sight to behold, most of the patrons hadnt a clue what to do.<br>
Seeming to form a entrance way with their bodies they formed two straight lines and path formed in between them, and in she walked again, this time she wasnt wearing a cloak over her robes, she was wearing adelaline robe in the open, as she entered, most of the men in the bar starred but soon looked back their drink for fear seemed to creep into them. Harte was right there was something mystical, magical about her, she was lightining in a bottle it seemed. Harte came from the back room to see this prosession coming into the Note.<br>
&quot; Have you found him yet druid? &quot; She snapped at Harte Greyeagle, who seemed bewildered by the question. She asked again but this time with a tone of superiority that rang through the bar &quot; Have you found my husband, Darkmask, yet, or are druids useless as rangers? &quot; to which Vandaal, who was pouring a drink looked up with a scowl at the high elven woman.<br>
&quot; What did you say about Rangers &quot; he asked in a brash tone, to which Harte raised his arm across Vandaals chest and whispered &quot; No need to bring about more commotion, she is a fiesty one, but dont taunt her back.. &quot;<br>
She walked around the bar, slowly eyeing most of the patrons, until she saw Ninou and her sister, she smiled at Ninou and quickly flipped her head back towards the large palidans in the doorway. &quot; Take her, the shadowknight, she spoke rudely to me, a Princess, she shall feel the might of the Silent Watch &quot; as a one of the Palidans moved in to grab Ninou, she bounced out her seat, light as a feather, she kicked the stool out from under her and leaped into the rafters. <br>
&quot; Oh boys, I have a rather dreadful hangover, would you please come back later and we can tussle then! &quot; Ninou grinned at the palidan, who then swung the avenger through one of the support beams, setting into two pieces, shiffitng the weight of the rafter Ninou was on and tumbling her down onto the floor, where she banged her head and fell unaware.<br>
&quot; Stop, you cannot do this! &quot; Harte stepped forward, his fists igniting into flames &quot; I will not have anyone attacked or imprisoned by an outside force while under the roof of the Note! &quot;<br>
The Princess looked at Harte, raised her hand and out leapt a flash of light, throwing Harte back into the wall. &quot; Take him too, he knows more then hes telling me &quot; To which some of the customers started to rise and rattle their weapons, an attack on any person of the note is an attack on all of the people in the Note, but they could see the palidans there were alot stronger then most of them, and they weilded weapons of legend, this was a battle they could not win.<br>
The cloaked figure lept from behind the table, dropping his hood, it was Radgen, who looked terrible, his skin was bruised, his eyes were a deep red, but he lifted his short sword towards the princess's neck and in a deep tone &quot; Let them go and leave and I wont slice her neck open and let her repaint the floor with her blood &quot;<br>
&quot; Fool &quot; She said, do you think my men would allow such danger to befall me as Radgen felt a sharp pain in the back of his neck and it went black.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Radgen strained to see what was going on, how long had he been out, what was going on, above him stood a small cleric, tending to his wounds, beside her stood Dorraxx the palidan, as they saw him waking, Dorraxx leaned over and whispered to him &quot; Welcome back Radgen, you have alot to catch up on &quot; <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Dorraxx looked up from Radgen and the wry grin dissolved from his face. &quot;Obviously Princess Paladin, manners did not make it inta yer royal schoolin. We told ye that we did not know where Darkmask went, an if he is indeed yer husband, shouldn't it be yer task ta find him? All of yer friends there with their Fiery Goblin Stickers there jest ta find yer own husband?&quot; The Dwarf growled at one of the paladins who had inched forward. &quot;I wouldn't imagine yer Priests would find such a misuse of their holy knights amusin... Unless there's more yer not tellin us. Which leaves me ta tha point I wish ta make: If ye tried usin a little more of a Paladin's patience an temperance in yer quests, others might not be as likely ta mistake ye fer a Shadow Knight.&quot; He looked askance at Ninou and winked. &quot;No insult intended dear Ninou.&quot;<br>
Dorraxx<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;I dont think so darlin..&quot;Ninou stood and sighed,&quot;If you think I'm coming with you your crazier then your husband at the moment....oh which by the way..I almost killed him the other night. He decided to charm me while I was naked,I dont take too kindly to that!&quot;She winked and rested a hand on her cleaver. &quot;If he wanted me..all he had to do was ask.&quot; Her voice had a edge to it,and she smiled as she saw the Princesses eyes widen. <br>
&quot;Tell me Princess,did he have to charm you to get you into bed?&quot;Ninou leaned against the wall,her eyes watching the guards. She saw Max nod,and wondered what was going through her sister's head. <br>
The High Elf was turning red with anger,as she screamed commands,Ninou laughed and tried seem as if this didnt bother her. It did bother her though,so much trouble surounded her in just a few days. She'd be lucky if Harte allowed her to stay on in the Note. <br>
Growling she walked away from the table and towards the bar..what did it matter any ways? She had no friends,no lover to be with. What did it matter if she failed in this fight? Thoughts raced through her mind,a strange tingling filled her and she realized Max had cast some spell on her. Which one she didnt know but anything helpful would work. She glanced over her shoulder to see how Harte was doing,then she gave Vandaal a nod. <br>
&quot;And since I'm a whore!&quot;She stressed the word,&quot;Your husband oviously had warmth with me. You must have been as cold as ice in bed.&quot;Her cat eyes,gleamed with intense power. She could feel it starting to boil within her. Then pushing it back down she sighed loudly,&quot;So I think you should give up on him. I like the Ol' High elf,maybe when he comes around again.....I'll just let him charm me. It'll be like white chocolate on dark!&quot; Winking again she blew a kiss to the stunned woman and walked out the door. If there was going to be a fight....it wasnt going to happen in Harte's place today. She cringed inwardly as the bright sun hit her face..&quot;Geez my head hurts.&quot;She mutter softly..... <br>
Ninou<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Lodach had been taken aback when the high elf guards had first entered and then that arrogant woman, who claim to be a princess demanding the location of Darkmask. <br>
Darkmask, that was that enchanter she had saved from Ninou when she had first arrived her at the note. He was married to this? <br>
Lodach was horrified when the princess ordered her guards take Ninou, that was against everything the Note stood for. This was a place for all to get along. As she was about to scream Ninou lept from her seat and into the rafters. “Stop, you cannot do this!” was the next thing she heard and she turned her head to Harte who had shouted it and watched as he began to cast a spell only to be thrown back against the wall as if a rag doll when the princess cast one with amazing speed. She immediataly began moving towards Harte to makes sure he was OK.<br>
When the stranger she had feed earlier had lept towards the princess all Lodach could do was watch. This had been the first time she had actually had a good look at his face. He had definitely been badly beaten but the bruises were several days old and beginning to healing. <br>
He was brave but not neccessarily thinking clearly at the time he had grab the princess, there were guards all around her and from experience she knew you should never let any of your foes behind you, especially one who would protect that which you were attacking.  The two guards who were standing in the doorway, acting within moments after he had made his move for this arroagant witch had used the hilt of thier swords on the back of his neck to knock him out cold. She looked back over to Harte and saw he was struggling to his feet, which from her healer’s perspective was a good sign. She adjusted her course to the stranger.<br>
The guards immediately tried to block her way, but she looked at them and said with a voice of steel. “Move out of my way. I am a cleric of Rodcet Nife and unless you want to be murders in an area where you have NO JURISDICTION what so ever you will let me by to tend to his injuries.” Lodach looked up at the princess and continued talking “I will not try to touch her Royal Arrogantness. I will only make sure that man lives.”<br>
With that she was allowed to move to the fallen elf. She sat down on the floor near his head and gently lifted his head into her lap, feeling the back of his neck for anything broken. She cast a few heal spells on him to stablize him. She was so focus on her work that she was unaware of most of what was happening around her. She was aware that Dorrax was standing beside her, yet she wasn’t sure when he had arrived or if he had said anything, her complete concentration was on her patient. <br>
Lodach<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harte's head wobbled in Lodach's arms, even though Harte seemed as a peaceful fellow, his heart pumped thunder, his soul had the strength of the wind, he was a master of the outdoors, a druid like no other save the infamous Jadae. Harte choose to suppress his powers, but now, now he was facing an enemy ten times stronger, the palidans were all able to traverse the planes and weilded weapons that were proof that they could slay Dragons and Necromancers of Old. Harte summoned the fury of the storm, and outside the weather changed, the blackness of the clouds crept in, the rain began to pour, they had called Harte out, and he was going to protect what he loved, his memories of Sasi, the note, and all his friends.<br>
Dorraxx saw this and lifted his axe, and eyed Ninou about to release her cleaver at the head of one of the Palidans. Lodach had a good heart, but healing was her nature, not fighting, she also knew she wasnt ready for such a battle.<br>
The Princess now infuriated with the patrons, especially a slippery little erudite shadow knight, started to cast spells, lauching magic left and right, some setting some of the patrons fleeing in fear and some stunned. Maxima, Ninou's sister called out &quot; Shes a bloody enchantress, get her, and I bet the rest will fall!! &quot; Ninou eyed her sister, and said<br>
&quot; You know for you being as crazy as you are, you sometimes have flashes of pure brillance! &quot; And Ninou shouted to all those ready to fight &quot; The woman, get the woman! &quot; as she flipped herself into the air, weapon above her head she dove at the Princess like a mad woman. Ninou was cut across the chest by a flaming sword, it passed through her, but didnt cut her, but did send her flying back towards a wall.<br>
Dorraxx was next he rolled into battle and kicked one of the palidans in the back of his knee, he saw his chance and drove the hilt of the axe into the back of his helmet, hoping to knock out a fellow palidan. Another palidan was fast approaching Dorraxx from behind when he was met with an arrow throw the gap in his armor between his chest and arm, Dorraxx looked up and saw Radgen and Vandaal drawing their bows in rapid sucession.<br>
Harte unleashed natures wrath at the palidans blowing them and most of the Note out of the front door onto the wet grass of the commonlands. Out there they found two more people fighting with one palidan, they struggled but they couldnt keep the struggle up.<br>
The battle raged on, the patrons of the Note fought and fought, but these were palidans who had become masters of their souls. It seemed like a constant struggle, back and forth, the strength of the hearts of the patrons versus well trained well equipped soilders of Tunare.<br>
Suddenly the palidans seemed to stop, the Princess has a large arm around her neck and sword pointed at her breastbone, it was the warrior who came looking for Darkmask earlier, he was the middle of the circle of palidans who seemed to turn their attention towards her and the threat he posed to her.<br>
&quot; Let go of me! You wont stop it, he will be mine, he is destined to be mine! &quot; The Princess screamed as she clawed his arms.<br>
&quot; I think not &quot; as he drove the blade into her chest, the blood slowly began to drip, as she started to go limp and finally fell to the ground. The Palidans all seemed to go limp as well, some of them just dropped to the ground, others stood frozen. The warrior removed an axe from a holster on his leg, and lifted above his head &quot; Now I send you back to Innorruk you vile witch! &quot; as the blade came down, white bubbles formed around the Princess, and with a blood dripping from her mouth she smiled and vanished as the axe hit the ground.<br>
Most of the patrons, sat and watched in stunned silence, but the warrior screamed &quot; Dung! She got away! &quot; as he looked around &quot; Please anyone that knows where Darkmask is, you must tell me, I come to save him, hes my father! &quot;<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Harte immediately began to bark orders before the paladins could again muster their strength.<br>
&quot;Ok, grab these oversized punching bags, restrain them and take names. I will report to the Paladin guilds about this. Being a scout for so many missions, I have friends in high places in most of those guilds. Also, someone find the softest one and get some information out of him about what just occurred here. I will not tolerate such hostile actions within the Note.&quot;<br>
As Harte finished, he abruptly turned and strode back inside the tavern. Although he appeared be filled with anger, the furor was aimed at himself. Those close-by, could hear him softly muttering to himself....<br>
&quot;Why did I use such force, it was not necessary. To call upon the powers of Karana when I could have used the much milder power of harmony first. What kind of druid am I?&quot;<br>
As he passed Ragden, he stopped and looked at his old friend.<br>
&quot;Sorry Ragden, you had asked me a question about Sasi. Come inside and let's get a drink and I'll tell you as much as I know... although my knowledge is all heresay with many holes.&quot;<br>
Without waiting for an answer, Harte walked inside the tavern again muttering to himself. <br>
Harte Greyeagle<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Lodach surveyed the chaos around her. She had been caught seriously off guard when Harte had cast back at the princess. He had somehow also managed to blow most everything in the note out the front door. This mess would take alot of work to clean up she thought, but first things first.<br>
She looked over her new friends for any signes that someone needed her attention immediately. Everyone was pretty beaten up but that was the extent of it. She could take her time and check everyone individually.<br>
The best part about being a cleric was being able to ease a friends pain, no matter how insignificant it was. Sometimes all it took was a kind look, a soft touch or a kiss on the cheek. If that didn't work then she had her spells. She was also known for her wonderful back and shoulder rubs that she was told relieved the strain from overworked and underused muscles and relaxed even the most worked up soldier after battle.<br>
Well there had definitely been a battle here. Now was the time to begin getting everyone to feel safe once more here in the Note. She moved through the crowd checking each and every patron and assisting with the smallest scratches and abrasions, bandaging wounds, extinguishing fatigue when necessary, and just lending herself to anyone who needed a moment to complain. Often times she had learned, that this was the best medicine. She would just let someone vent a little and then they would feel vindicated, at least for the moment.<br>
Sometimes this work was hard when she herself needed time to contemplate all that had happened, but she had learned that there would be time for herself later. Those who actually do the fighting needed her at 100% before, during and after battle. she would not show her personal fears or doubts to a battle harden veteran or a worker of the arts of magic. She had to put her fears aside and show each one that she hadn't doubted them for a second.<br>
Many of her fellow cleric's told her she was silly. As a cleric, they would say, you are only there to heal then move on to the next patient. She didn't agree. she figured her actions often times set the mood for those who were depending on her. If she showed that she believed in them, they seemed to perform or recover that much faster.<br>
She looked up at the Orge she was carefully bandaging and smiled, he was watching her closely, so as she finished her work she reached up touched his cheek and gave him a kiss on his chin. Which was the highest point she could reach on her tippy toes. Orges were so much taller than humans. She then turned around and looked for her next patient.<br>
Lodach<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The large warrior sat on the ground where he had slayed the Princess, he cupped his face in his hands, and began to curse to himself in an unknown tounge to most. He removed the rather large weapon from his back and placed it in his hands, with his hand on the hilt, he drove it into the ground, the sword glowed a bright red for only a second, but then stopped.<br>
One of the Erudites who had hit on him earlier was speaking to him, but she seemed to be babbling, all he wanted to know was where was his father, Darkmask. <br>
He watched as most of the patrons slowly moved furniture back inside, and how the half elf was barking orders to everyone, and he watched a small dwarf rounding up the palidans who seemed to be non resistant.<br>
He got up from the ground, dusted himself off and walked over to the dwarf, and spoke in dwarven.<br>
&quot; These noble men were being controlled by that woman, that evil woman, they are not to blame, they did not know what they were doing, she has a position of power in Felewithe, and she used it to weave spells over the Silent Watch of the city, who are the strongest, most war ready palidans the city has, they will not remember any of this in a few hours, so I tell you bringing charges will do no good, we must strike at the heart of the vile witch to acheive anything! &quot;<br>
Dorraxx who was listening looked up at the large warrior &quot; I know lad, but they must be brought back to felewith, Lord Jyle would probably like to see where his elite palidans have been. &quot;<br>
Harte saw this dialouge going on, and understood that the warrior had more of clue about all that went on then anyone save for the Princess and Darkmask. So Harte walked over to the warrior, extended his hand and said &quot; I am sorry, we havent properly met, I am Harte Greyeagle, manager of the Missed Note, and you are... &quot; <br>
&quot; ....Not Happy, the enchantress got away, and shes going after my father &quot; The warrior paused and grabbed Harte's hand &quot; I am Champion Darque, warrior of the wandering storm, son of the High Elven Lord Darkmask, and its a pleasure to meet you, I have heard tales of the infamous Harte..&quot;<br>
Harte's eyebrows twisted once again &quot; Son? High Elven Lord? &quot; Harte questioned &quot; I have known Darkmask for awhile and he never metioned a family, let alone he never came off as being royality of Felewithe..can you help explain all this to me...it might help &quot;<br>
&quot; I would love to, you see.. &quot; as he began to speak, a spirit wolf ran towards him, changing form it became a wood elf ranger who was clad in ivy etched armor. He had a golden bow in one hand, and he seemed to flow with the very wind itself, he ran up to Champion Darque and knelt down.<br>
&quot; My Lord, I have found a trail, but we must leave now, it is getting close to the final wind, and when that happens...&quot; The ranger said trailing off the rest as he looked around &quot; I see you have made quite a mess again My Lord, do we need to reimburse the owner? &quot;<br>
&quot; Aye, give the half elf 2000platium pieces, and lets be off, I cannot lose my father to that witch nor Karana. &quot; With that the ranger removed a bag from his back and placed it in front of Harte, the ranger opened it, and Harte saw 20 pure platium bars, the ranger looked up and smiled. The warrior and the ranger ran off towards the wizard spires.<br>
Harte lifted the bag, looked around, and slowly dragged it back into the Note. Harte heard the warriors voice in his head &quot; If you want to help save my father, round up five strong people to come to the frontier mountains in Kunark, I trust you know yer men and women best, so I will meet you at the wizard spires with yer team, and from their we move out, chose only the ones that are willing, some may not come back if I know this witch. I am porting out now, good luck. <br>
Champion Darque <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harte watched as Lenlalron danced around with an imaginary figure, he seemed to yelling at it, Lenlalron was always a little strange, but he seemed to be lost in his own thoughts.<br>
Harte placed his hand on the young mage's shoulder and whispered to him &quot; Calm down, dont be so eager to attack &quot; to which Lenlalron opened his eyes, and looked at Harte.<br>
&quot; I just wanted to try to reach Darkmask in my mind, I am sure he has some answers and I am tired of waiting &quot; The mage spoke.<br>
&quot; I understand, but Darkmask hasnt been heard from in some time and for all my attempts to contact him, I have failed, so dont worry too much, we will save him, I know you are as concerned as I am &quot; Harte said looking at the mage, his right on the shoulder of Lenlalron which hs patted a few times and walked off.<br>
Harte looked around, he had to choose a team, but who, who had the skills neccesary to survive the perils of the dreadlands.<br>
Harte looked at Ninou and her sister Maxi, he had seen Ninou fight fiercely, but Maxi was nowhere ready for such a journey, he looked towards Dorraxx who was a battle ready palidan, and whose wisdom had help guide many a patron of the note, there was also Lenlalron, but his temper could leap out of control like a flame, he was too eager to strike, there was Lodach, a well liked cleric but was she ready for the dangers yet to come, there was Pikel who was wrapped upstairs in bed in a deep sleep, he was a master of stealth and attack, he would have to come, but who else.....Harte looked around and started to ask the following people to go. <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I could tell that quite a story could be told, evidence of the condition of the Tavern when I arrived. I had spent several days and nights in the Mountains of Skyfire, slaying dragons and seeking new knowledge. My return to the Tavern had found Harte surveying the small group of patrons that were scattered throughout the main floor.<br>
I could tell that Harte was in some sort of need. &quot;Harte, what has happened here? You appear to be searching for something among the crowd.&quot;<br>
&quot;I have heard of Darkmask's sudden disappearance, and of some sort of attack from a Paladin Empire. Is there anything that I may do to help?&quot;<br>
&quot;Have you seen my good friend Vandaal? I believe that we need to bring some joy to the Tavern, and we shall provide the beast for a wonderful feast. Eerr, if it pleases you m'lord.&quot;<br>
Gulasx Uthayoni<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Vandaal came out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on his apron. After the battle with the paladins and the witch, he had headed inside to do some cooking, figuring that in spite of everything, the Note needed to feed people and get them drunk to stay in business. He marvelled at his shopkeeper mentality, then shrugged it off as just another facet of his duty in Norrath.<br>
Seeing Gulasx enter, he smiled. &quot;Gulasx!&quot; he proclaimed.<br>
The druid smiled at the enthusiasm. The ranger was a genuine and sincere elf, always quick with a smile or a kind word. Knowing a little about Vandaal's past, he found this surprising.<br>
&quot;I have many tales to tell, Vandaal. I have seen dragons, and treasure you would not believe. But there seems to be other important matters afoot.&quot; He nodded towards Harte, who seemed lost in thought. &quot;It seems Harte needs to chose a group of people for a very dangerous mission. I assume you will be going?&quot;<br>
Vandaal thought about this. Knowing what had transpired at the inn today, he was hesitant.<br>
&quot;Actually, I will probably stay here. If Harte is needed elsewhere, someone will need to oversee the Note.&quot; He looked at Harte, a frown creasing his half-elven features.<br>
&quot;Harte, if you must go to aid Darkmask, rest assure that the Note will be well taken care of in your absence.&quot; He walked over to the half-elf, laying a hand on his shoulder. Harte turned towards him, a question on his lips. Vandaal interrupted him.<br>
&quot;And should you not return, for whatever reason, know this. While I live and breath, the Note will always stay open.&quot; Harte seemed to relax a little at this.<br>
&quot;Now, chose your party of adventurers and do what you must. The Note will be here when you return.&quot; He then looked at Lenlalron, a smile on his lips. &quot;Especially if you take Len here, as he seems to be the greatest threat the Note has ever known.&quot;<br>
There was silence for a moment, and then Lenlalron began to chuckle. Soon, everyone joined in.<br>
Vandaal <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
She had heard what the warrior had said and she dwelled on it as she swept the floor and tried to clean the place up after this nights ill fated visit from the Princess. She had already done all she could for anyone who had been injured in the brawl, so now she was simply trying to clean up the place as efficiently as possible, she looked around and realized this might take several hours of work. <br>
She sighed and continued sweeping up the broken glass behind the bar. How Harte didn’t get cut from the broken bottles when the Princess caught him with that spell, she would never know but she was thankful he was fine. She knew this from the orders he barked once things started turning bad for the princess. He was a true leader and it was easy to see why people responded to his commands, quickly.<br>
The Princess must be madder than Dragoon Zytl on a bad day right about now. She had managed to escape the brave young warrior’s final blow and Lodach had a strange feeling that she hadn’t seen the last of her. She just hoped it wasn’t back here at the Note, cleaning up after her was a lot of work. <br>
She wouldn’t ask to go along to find Darkmask, but would if Harte thought her services were needed. After all as far as she knew she was the only cleric here at the Note currently. <br>
Well looking up from her sweeping she noticed that things were picking up and she put the broom aside and headed back out to wait the tables. She was glad Vandaal had worked up a wonderful meal and the smells wafting out of the kitchen were sure to bring in many orders. Back to work she thought. <br>
Lodach<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
He had been very quiet lately, just watching the goings on in the tavern. By tomorrow, he had to assemble the group that would travel with him on his journey. Today, he was studying the people in the Note, trying to determine who would best fit.<br>
He had seen the flare up with Len and knew the Note's guests and staff had handled it well. Harte would deal swiftly and painfully to anyone who attempted to damage the Note.<br>
With that thought come and gone, Harte went back to studying his friends. Who in the place could spend a few weeks together, fight together and maybe die together? <br>
Harte Greyeagle<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Darkmask sat from his place on the ground, the wind suddenly changed, something was stirring, he could feel Karana's blessing no longer on the edge of the wind, he sat and wondered, he felt a strange warmth in his body, he looked down to his chest, the handprint was still there, but no longer burned, the golden dragon was still etched in his chest, but it didnt seem to echo Sasi's song anymore. He wondered what had happened to Sasi that he could no longer hear her song when he thought of her, he felt terrible at the mere thought of forgetting his friend. What does that say about his heart if he only gets away from the Note for a short while and he forgets all he was. He thought for a second, pondering, then realized that the wind was not changing for that, in fact a storm was brewing, Karana was urging Darkmask to move from his place in the mountains, he could hear the winds begin to howl and the rain beat down on his face and robes.<br>
&quot; Karana &quot; Darkmask said into the wind &quot; What do you seek of me, why wont you talk to me, I have prayed to you my whole life, and now, when I need you, I am all alone &quot;<br>
Lighting struck and thunder boomed, Darkmask knew he had to seek shelter for this storm would be rough, he knew that Karnors castle was not far, but it was inhabited by evil creatures, who could see through his magic, he looked around the hillside and saw a cave, with a huge demon head above it, he quickly checked his pouch for his maps, he scanned them, and it didnt appear on any of the rangers of kelethin maps, but Darkmask had to take a chance, this storm was goind to be big, he picked up his things and headed for the cave, casting a spell to hide himself from any goblins, burynai miners, or saranaks. He made his way into the cave, it was warm and dry, but filled with odd goblins who seemed very strong, he moved forward slowly, but suddenly fell down a trap into a lowerlevel of the cave, hitting his head, his eyes blinked a few times before closing.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
She had barely escaped the axe of that damn Warrior, how had he found out about this, he was supposed to be exploring the mystical plane of air, but he somehow found out about her quest to find Darkmask once again. She had lead a life of deception, forcing Darkmask's family to wed hers in order to procure Darkmask, and more so, the relic that only Darkmask posessed. She had weaved her spells over the family Disillusion and moved herself in as wife of their son, this was not an easy task, for he had a lover, a human, a beautiful woman, and she gave birth to twins, a son and a daughter, she had made she sure to deal with the woman, she had the woman poisoned when she slept, Darkmask thought she died of natural causes, and he was grief stricken, his family insisted that he marry Larenina, her family would only add wealth and happiness to Disillusion household, but the sad truth is her family was broke, she was a master mind weaver, and was hoping to gain the fortune Disillusion and their sacred artifact.<br>
Darkmask who was known as Lord Gel~ ( Gu El ) sank into a depression over losing his love, and not clear of mind wed this woman he barely knew, she took his children to raise as he struggled to free his mind of the demons of his beloveds death.<br>
She was cruel to the twins, often not feeding them, leaving them outside at night, ( hoping the animals or orcs would take them and eat them ), she beat them, they were only babies, but Darkmask got word of this, and he had to dimiss his pain, he forgot what wonderful treasures his children were, how they had the same gleam in their as their mother. Things began to change, he took control of the house back over, made sure the children were well taken care of. This did not sit well with Larenina who dispised the children and saw them as bastard heirs to her fortune. She acted like a normal mother, she even insisted on making the meals for the family. Once again she attempted to poison the family, all feel ill save Darkmask. He finally understood what she was trying to do, so he took the children in the middle of the night and vanished. She then publicly denouced him, saying she was an abused wife, and he had stolen the children for his own sexual purposes. The high court gave her control of the wealth and power of the house Disillusion as soon as the parents were to die, which oddly enough they did, after one of her dinners.<br>
What Darkmask did with the children and where he fled Larenina will never know, but she knows, that Darkmask's name had been cleared by her son some years later, and that she was too prove that she was the rightful owner of the house ( which she had let go to waste ) and the money ( which she had spent most of it ), she was to return the family artifact, if she did, that would be a clear sign that Darkmask had given her control, but if she didnt return it with in a years time, she would be banished, and removed from the house, and her position of power taken away, her influnence and ties no more, and her private security, the silent watch, would be sent to another house. She would not lose all this, she had worked too hard, pulled too many strings to let her dear husband and his motherless son take it from her!! <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dorraxx saw that Harte was doing his best to prepare for the journey and to gather those who would go, but the Dwarf also saw that Harte was deeply distracted, so he pitched in where he could.<br>
The supplies were easy enough to gather anyway. Harte was far more experienced than he at preparing for what they were to do, so Dorraxx left the Druid to those matters.<br>
Dorraxx found himself distracted at times, but it was the sisters Ninou and Maxima that provided his distraction. He liked Ninou. Something about the tragic young Shadow Knight drew him like a moth to the flame. He did not hold the fact that she was a fallen Paladin against her, indeed, he respected her even more for knowing herself enough to make the change. Many times he had seen Paladins across Norrath that were no better than Lucan himself. Ninou had more good in her than she believed, he saw it. Someday, perhaps she would too.<br>
Dorraxx's interest in other people had grown since he first traveled to Freeport many seasons before. While many of his race were content to stay in their Hold their whole lives, he had traveled the lands as soon as he could wield sword and shield. He enjoyed watching people and their interactions with each other and the world around them, and the tragic souls were the ones who always seemed to act with the most passion and intensity. Ninou was the most passionate and intense young woman he had met since - in a long while.<br>
Maxima was a different matter. Though appearing quite mad on the outside, her own intensity and clarity proved her to be anything but. She knew herself and and she had a gift for knowing the heart of those around her, all the while enjoying herself immensely at what ever task presently occupied her. She loved her sister, Dorraxx could tell, even though that love seemed to drive Ninou crazy at times.<br>
He chuckled to himself, drawing strange looks from a nearby table of patrons. Maxima would be Ninou's rock in the storm...and whether Ninou clung tightly to that rock or dashed herself upon it remained to be seen. <br>
Dorraxx<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There at the bottom of the pit layed Darkmask, his head opened on a rock, the blood of his body pouring forth onto the ground, his skin had turned almost see through, the parts of his skin on the ground were deep purple though, he strained to breathe, the blood in his mouth filled, his body was broken through and through, his mind slowly drifted to a quiet place where he could be alone from all the pain....he found it, a golden light called to him, and he followed, as his mind was lost to the world, his heart slowly stopped pumping the blood onto the rocks....his breathing came to halt....Darkmask has died, alone, at the bottom of a cave.<br>
Soon goblins came, they saw the body, they smelled the flesh and blood, and they saw this as a treasure, they dragged the body to the underground city, there, they proceeded to slice and dice the enchanter like a fine piece of meat, each took turns tasting his flesh, goblins loved elven flesh, especially high elven flesh. They ate what was left of his body, and distrubuted the bones among the bonecasters and rockcharmers, the skull however was given to the cheif and he was to deliver it to Sathir's treasury.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
What has become of Darkmask's Skull, no one yet knows, but it is rumored recently that only a vicar with divine powers can ressurect a body from shattered fragments. The soul is a different matter, his soul has gone to another plane, only with hope that he fell in love and gave his soul to someone, if so, the person he loves must take the piece in herself and place it back into his body during the cermony.<br>

Xanta had found, secretly hording the collection, the bones of Darkmask. From a necromancer of high renown, she gained his skull, not asking any more questions than neccessary, knowing the feel of Darkmask's skull, as she'd watched him so long, using every seduction in the book against the necromancer, swallowing her own pride and humility. She had waited too long, she feared, too long had she gone without saying what she felt. She could only hope she had enough of his bones to work the magic, and she knew she'd feel drained when she did so. Darkmask was worth this though, a moment of loss, an hour of pain, a week of grief, for him, yes. While Xanta had only enough mastery of her cleric art to the 59th season, she pleaded to the Goddess Tunare, that this ressurection would work. She felt she was too late, but hoped, and meditated.<br>
<br>
Weaving her hands through the air, she began the old way, the ways before her quest for the Water Sprinkler. This must be done right, she knew. She began the old incantation, and realized, there must be more. She slipped into a trance, recalling where she'd first seen him, how he'd touched her and he did not know, the time the rogue Kealii dragged his battered body to her in Karnor's Castle, and she'd brought him back then, her heart beating so fast against her ribcage, she thought surely he could hear her. How she had fallen in love with him, after hearing his name echoed in the cleric halls in Felewithe, whispered by another sister cleric, who'd succumbed to the lure of evil, using her power in twisted ways. These things she confessed, as she thought of the loss of him, reworking an old magic, into something of her own.<br>
<br>
Pulling a small dagger from her bags, this she'd found once in Befallen, the only dagger she could ever hope to use to cut herself, she opened for a moment her tunic, and slashed at her chest, at her heart. Cringing, she knew this would never heal, as it was her own sacrifice. Nothing deep, but she needed her own life blood for this, too long had she waited for him. She whispered, "May my life be yours, I am your servant and your mistress, I will follow you, and may you follow me, my heart beats for you, may yours beat for me. I give you this, my essence, my soul. For without you there is no forever, without you, I wish to join you as bones abused by both necromancer and shadowknight, without you, I forsake life." Tears streamed down her cheeks, as she continued. "Never will I be silent again, but nor do I wish for you to know that I give so much to you... May my love be both loud and silent, may you feel me within you, and around you, and through you... Darkmask, I love you... F O R E V E R...." <br>
<br>
She flung her head back to the sky, howling this last word, hearing it echo through the hills. She hoped with her whole self that this would be enough, that she might be enough, and the one to ressurect him. Feeling the final rush of light, she stretched out her hands, hoped one last time, her body shaking with both hope and sorrow, and from her fingers let flow the blue light.<br>
<br>
Slowly, so slowly, the bones came together, forming a skeleton. She feared for a moment she'd gone too far, and somehow become a necromancer, till she began to see his body flicker into sight, as she had known him. As his aura formed around him, she began to work a celetial elixir, feeling the pulse of her heart behind it, and touched his flickering self, letting both the light and her emotion pulse into him. She watched as his heart began to beat, and he looked up at her, in wonderment, in amazement. His eyes lit up, as if he truly saw her, for the first time. She watched as he became solid, and from her bags, pulled all his old things, that she'd managed to find. His robe, his staff, a mug, a wreath. This were trinkets of memory only, no value anymore, not with what he'd had. Perhaps a banker still kept a key to his holdings, bank customers going long periods of time without looking in their vaults. However, for now, this was inconsequential. <br>
<br>
He was alive. Breathing, his heart beating, his eyes flashing, taking all things in around him, and Darkmask looked at Xanta.<br>
<br>
Helping him rise up into a sitting position, she stepped back, relishing the closeness, and his now warmth, so opposite from the chill of his bones. She wrapped a blanket round him, and brought him his things. As he dressed, she spoke.<br>
<br>
"Darkmask," she whispered. "I've brought you back. I hope I've not intruded on your sleep. My love."<br>
<br>
Darkmask cocked his head a bit at the "my love", but waited for Xanta to say more. Seeing as this was all, he pondered for a moment while he finished dressed.<br>
<br>
She'd added the last bit as a confession, and she bit her lip. She was a bit afraid, that after all this, he'd turn away from her. He sensed this, and started to speak, then motioned for a drink. Pulling several water flasks from her bags, Xanta brought them to him.<br>
<br>
"It has been a long time, Xanta, too long."<br>
<br>
"Aye, I am so sorry, Darkmask, I didn't know.. I only knew of your passing, but... that was all. No one told me, no one. I knew only after it was too late."<br>
<br>
"But was it too late, my dear? Was it?"<br>
<br>
Xanta blushed furiously, and again with the tears, forming and coursing down her cheek. "It was," she confessed.<br>
<br>
Darkmask looked amazed. "You... how... why did you..."<br>
<br>
Looking at the ground for a moment, she replied, "Because for too long I have been silent, and," she fidgeted a moment, then rose her eyes and looked at him, "I have loved you. And I always will."<br>
<br>
She lowered herself to him, sitting on her knees in front of him, and forgetting her place, and not caring where it was, reached for his face. With a hand, she ran her fingers over his jaw, feeling his fine lines. She ran her thumb over one of his eyebrows, and could tell he'd frowned for much time. She mimicked this movement with her other hand, and then ran her fingers through his hair, drew his face close to her, and kissed him, her lips catching his lower lip, drawing his mouth into hers, feeling him return the kiss.<br>
