Ever since I first meet Dolumar at his welcome home party I have had a special place in my heart for him. He has been nothing but kind and caring where I am concerned. Here is what he has done just for Maillena since I have met him.<br>
<br>
He takes the time, even while fighting to talk with me via tells. He listens when I am having a problem or am upset and he talks with me to help me calm down and to get my head back into the game.<br>
<br>
A few nights ago some friends and I were hunting the chessboard in BB and we had caused the king to spawn, being as how I am lvl 10 and my friends were lvls 8 and 9 we needed to have someone kill the king. I knew that Dolumar was in zone and I sent him a tell explaining the situation and he asked me to give him 5 minutes and he would be there. True to his word, he came to the chessboard, grouped with us and he transformed all of us into wolves (heheh which I loved and so did my friends) he proceeded to kill the king for us so that we could continue to hunt.<br>
<br>
Everytime I am in a zone I always shout out to any and all Random Acts in zone and if Dolumar is there he always shouts to me, as do the other meembers of the family. What really makes him special to me is what he did for me last night.<br>
<br>
I was in Kelethin and started to make the run to Qeynos for the First Aide Camp that is happening today. I was chatting with Dolumar (as normal) and I was basically giving him a progress report of my run. I was in FP when he told me to get to the Druid Ring in WC and he would port me to NK, thus avoiding HH and EK, which at lvl 10 still scare me a bit. I started my run through WC when Drogoon Aytl spawned in right next to me, needless to say we know what he thinks of halflings. I died when I was almost to the Kith zone. I was on the verge of tears due to that. (for you see, Dragoon adn I have a very long and nasty history, he does not like it when I run any of my characters through WC) I told Dolumar when I got back to FP that I had died and who had killed me. I got a SoW and once again started my run to WC and to my body. While I was doing that Dolumar tp'd to WC and tried to find my body for me. Well needless to say I had run past Dolumar and &quot;BOOM&quot; Dragoon was on me once again. Dolumar told me to keep running and he would get ahold of Zytl and deal with him. Unfortunately I died due to the Dragoon again, dispite all of Dolumar's efforts, and for his efforts he was forced to zone cause he had 4 dark elves on him when he attacked the Dragoon in my defense. When I zoned back into FP I was literally crying cause I was so furious and upset. I could not even fathom running back to my body and possibly meeting the Dragoon again. I gave Consent to Dolumar to drag my body once he finished zoning. It took him some time for he went LD, ehich gave me time to mem some spells. I was never so happy to see someone as I was when I saw Dolumar with my corpse in my life. It ment that I did not have to run into the Dragoon again. From there Dolumar ported me to NK and he gave me the directions about how to get from the druid ring to the WK zone. From WK I knew the way, for I have hunted in WK many a times as other characters. <br>
<br>
I know that this is long winded but you see, Dolumar won't brag about what he has done to help a young one in the game so I am doing it for him. I also wanted the family to know who much Dolumar gives of his time and just what lengths he goes to to help those of the family and those who are in need. <br>
<br>
Dolumar I want you to know that I am very proud to call you my brother and my friend. I will do my best to aid you and all others who need it no matter what the situation.<br>
<br>
Your humble and devoted servent and sister,<br>
