<br>
I'd like to add a story about my favorite mistake, which was last shown this night while hunting in Oasis.<br>
<br>
Ok, I already said, we were hunting in Oasis <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  at the Orc Highway. It was all running very smoothly, the orcs ran by on their 'highway' (to hell ?? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and we were picking them as if they were presented on a tray.<br>
Then suddenly someone cried &quot;SPEC !!&quot; and we were all looking around and scared like hell if it would attack us soon. But then we saw that some people were hunting it and they did quite well, so that the spectre was soon taken down and we all could take a deep breath again. The next Specs that passed us were taken by those people as well and though we were still a bit nervous to have those vile beasts around, while fighting the orcs, we were sure that those spec hunters would handle them as well, and they did.<br>
<br>
So we were hunting orcs and the high lvl people were hunting specs, so what had to happen at one point ??<br>
Yes, the Spec hunters broke loose a spec train, not one or two but 4 to 5 specs, now all heading our way with the hunters fleeing from them. Needless to say those Spectres were hungry for flesh (though they are undead <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and so they did not just chase their initial attackers but turned on us sitting there on a tray (doesn't that last sentence remind you of another one I wrote earlier in this posting *g*)<br>
So we all ran away, I choosed to run directly through the pile of specs towards the nearest zone border, which draw a few of them on me, I don't think they were all on me but at least 2 I heard. Well, I ran towards the zone with the specs casting their lifedraining spells on me, but gladly those undead minions of Innoruk were very slow moving compared to me, even without 'Spirit of the Wolf' I was able to get out of their casting range with still enough of my health left....when I suddenly met an orc priest which immediately attacked me with his own spells *sigh*<br>
That was more than my (though well trained <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) body could take and I was too weak to continue running. While now WALKING towards the (still not visible) zone border I thought to myself...<br>
&quot;&quot;Ok, I should prepare to call upon my deity now, for this healing touch to refill my hurt body with new energy. Hmm, but maybe I should wait a bit longer...I think I'm at still 1/6 of my normal health, might be enough (only 70HPs left. but I wasn't quite intelligent). Yes, I think I will wait... *dumb,dumb* &quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Did I mention I was walking ?? O yes I did and the specs were slow....while I was running, not walking. Next thing to happen was another spell from the specs that were in range again....and my lifeless body felt into the hot sand of Oasis or 'Loading please wait'<br>
<br>
I really had enough time to use this great LoH which would've restored all my HPs, but oh well...<br>
At least no one else in the group died and that takes away most of my anger I felt while dying, I rather die myself instead of having to watch others die.<br>
<br>
And that was what happened this evening, tune in next time, when Tevael dies because he felt off a tower in Rathe, hehe.<br>
<br>
 <p>Farewell !!<br>
Tevael</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsstories.showMessage?topicID=31.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsstories.showMessage?topicID=27.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsstories.emailToFriend?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsstories.threadControl?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/sunset/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsstories.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsstories.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="randomactsfrm6">Fledgling and Prospective Members<option value="randomactsgeneraldiscussion">Guild Roundtable<option value="randomactsfrm8">Hurray for . . .<option value="randomactsmemberinformation">Getting to Know RA<option value="randomactsfrm11">Volunteers of Random Acts<option value="randomactsevents">Hunting and Gathering<option value="randomactsfrm21">Prize Patrol<option value="randomactsstories">The Lore of Norrath: Tips, Skills<option value="randomactsfrm10">Equipment, Spells and Quests<option value="randomactsfrm17">Tech Tips<option value="randomactsfrm9">Adventuring in other Worlds<option value="randomactsfrm23">Members Only<option value="randomactsfrm7">Council and Officer Discussions <option value="randomactsfrm25">I have stuff!<option value="randomactsfrm26">I need stuff!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#006400>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/brandomacts>Random Acts</a><font color=#006400> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsstories>The Lore of Norrath: Tips, Skills</a> <font color=#006400> - </font><a href="http://www.eqrandomacts.com">Random Acts Website</a><font color=#006400> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
