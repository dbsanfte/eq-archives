to get us started on this forum. --Hamadryad<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a way to get to know each other...<br>
<br>
Ooc: Hiya all! Just wanted to start this thread so we know more about <br>
each other and the experiences we've come across in the EQ world. <br>
I'll be posting more posts like this (question sort of posts) to help us grow <br>
stronger together. As you know, it doesn't matter how big your guild is, <br>
what matters is the connection and friendships the guild gives you. <br>
Well, here is the first of many question based posts.<br>
<br>
List 3 to 5 of the most memorable experiences you've had so far in EQ?<br>
<br>
1) The first moment that I will never forget was my very first 10 minutes<br>
into the game. It was in the cold city of Halas and I had no idea what <br>
to do as I was totally lost. I didn't even know how to use the /ooc or <br>
/shout commands (okay, so I'm one of those who doesn't read the manual <br>
before I jump into games...hehe). Well, this kind barbarian warrior was at <br>
the dock and he was kind enough to show me the way to the warriors<br>
guild. Boy was I happy. I was using first person view and I was trying to <br>
follow him as good as I could (I never did play 1st person view games so<br>
it was pretty difficult). I was like wow, look at all these neat buildings and.<br>
**SPLASH** I found myself in the well, drowing and eventually I died by <br>
drowning. Till this day I hang the walls in that areaavoiding that dang well!!<br>
<br>
 2) My first death by another player (I played on RZ). I thought I was <br>
doing awesome notgetting killed as I managed to escape and run to the <br>
guards. However, one time with my hunting mate heading back to town <br>
I was by myself. I thought I knew the peaks well enough (not even close)<br>
and well got lost. Well, I ended up at a ice goblin scout igloo<br>
and managed to live, but I was at 1 bub of health. Then came running up <br>
to me a warrior by the name Lumor. It wasn't that I was upset that it was <br>
my first death on EQ, but how he did it. He just kept knocking me out of <br>
consciousness for like 5 minutes just laughing at me the whole time. <br>
I could've of turned of my computer but didn't, I could've petitioned <br>
but didn't know how. When it was all said and done he took my only<br>
valuable item...a rusty broad sword (weapon slots were still lootable <br>
back then). <br>
<br>
3) First time I saw a giant. This was in WK, I felt big and bad that <br>
I was a lvl 10 barb warrior with a rusty halbard. There was about 9 others <br>
there camping the bandits. Well, in a matter of seconds everyone died <br>
and I was like what the heck then I turned around and basically died. <br>
After I came back from the loading screen I saw teh text...You have<br>
been slain by a hill giant. But eventually I took revenge on the hill giants <br>
as I killed them in a daily basis with a group...woohoo.<br>
<br>
4) First time getting blinded. As you know, I played on RZ. Well, I knew a <br>
pk would get me, I see &lt;name&gt; begins to cast a spell, that moment <br>
I expected to get rooted or blasted, but wait...screen went total pitch black. <br>
I was like, ah dang, my computer is messing up right in the middle of this <br>
attack. Eventually my screen went back up and<br>
saw me at my bind point. Dang blind spell. hehe.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, there ya go...some of my most memorable moments in EQ. Take care all.<br>

We had just ducked two griffons and giant. One griffon had lost out to the dwarf brothers in front of the inn. So when asked to find something to fight I picked this blue conning rattlesnake. Easy stuff. While we were wailing away at the poor snake I looked around with a change of camera and noted that a griffon was coming up behind us and what looked a Dark Elf warrior was coming down the road. I tried to type a warning for the griff fast. But not fast enough. We started to run back to the Dwarf or the guards at the toll booth, but didn't make it. I thought the Dark Elf was a player. Wrong. In fact Kizdean Dix started beating on Bedawin's animation just as the rattlesnake died. As soon as poor Gibaner died, it was my turn. The griffon took out Bedawin then went after the Dark Elf. Just before he killed me the Kizdean Dix tells me &quot;In your next life, do not challenge a member of the Dead. We have no time for childish games.&quot; (for info: Kizdean Dix was dishing out 30-36 damage on me while the griff was dealing 90 or so on Kizdean... I wonder who won. I dont think it was the Dark Elf. I died next to the dwarf at the inn. He did not participate while I was alive.) Moral: watch out for blue MOBs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/brandomacts.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=karal>Karal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#006400>(8/15/00 10:41:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reprint: Jellybean most memorable moments</span><hr size=1> Greetings All,<br>

First 5 minutes in Norrath:<br>
<br>
My first character was a simple human warrior in Qeynos, I think.  I got killed right away because I didn't know to remap the &quot;a&quot; key at the time.  So I pop up again, not in the town, no, outside the town, and the silly human can't see to find his way back through the tunnel to retrieve his lightsource.  As far as I know, the silly human is STILL wandering around in that tunnel, cause I got disgusted, logged, and never went back.<br>
<br>
2.  My first cool weapon.<br>
<br>
So I'm 5th level, beating up skunks in Butcherblock for XP.  I kill a skunk and he has an ax for loot!  Cool, I say.  Holy Toledo!  It's a Bronze 2H Battle Axe!  Hmmm, wonder where he kept it?  No matter.  So now I have this really bitchin' ax.  Dishes out lots of damage for a 5th level Paladin.  The only problem is, being an elf, I only have a 85 strength and I can barely lift the silly thing.  Here's how the typical battle went:  whack, whack, rest, rest, rest, whack, rest, rest, whack, whack, and so on, ad nauseum.  After 2 long melees in a row, my stamina would hit bottom.  Needless to say, I gave up the 2 hander for the 1H and shield I carry now.<br>
<br>
3.  The day Hamadryad tagged me.<br>
<br>
As anyone that's read my posts can attest, I was overjoyed to find out about Random Acts.  My first five levels were missing something, and RA filled the void.  Now, life is good.  From raids on Crushbone, to First Aid Camps, to Tavadelphin SoWing me so I can retrieve my corpse after I got a little ballsy with a pair of blue cents right after I got my new level and the cents killed me and I lost my level, (whew, long sentence) EQ is just much more enjoyable with you guys.<br>
<br>
4.  Escorting my human friend, Belfon, through Butcherblock.<br>
<br>
Belfon is played by an old friend of mine.  Belfon and Finrael used to adventurer together in our AD&amp;D days lo these many moons ago.  So Belfon is travelling to the land of elves.  I pick him up at the docks in BBM and off we go.  I'm running, he's following.  We run past a guard house and the Guards run past me and I hear them beating something into the ground behind me.  I say to the party, &quot;Someone's catching hell from the dwarves, LOL&quot;, and just about then I notice Belfon's bar has gone purple.  LMOA!!  Who knew humans are KoS with dwarves?  ROFLMOA!!<br>
<br>
5.  Fighting slavers too close to the slaves.<br>
<br>
The guys at Verant are sickos, because they imbued the elf slaves in Crushbone with that syndrome where they start to like their captors.  I jump this slaver, and I've got him about half way down, when an elf priest slave starts healing him!  It didn't bother me at first, until I realize the elf's healing is keeping up with my damage.  I was doing very well, until then.  After a minute of this, I realize I'm not gonna win this if I don't do something.  I start to turn and pull the slaver away, but what fun would that be, so I start looking for the elf.  Turns out he's inside the cabin, healing the orc through the walls.  DOH!  So I kick down the cabin door (figuratively), stomp the elf, then turn my wrath back on the slaver.  Of course I took the faction hit when the elf died, but it was worth it, because the slaver gave me 12th level! <p><B>Finrael of Felwithe</B><BR>
