I pulled from many sources to write this and wanted to share it with you. <br>
Nikola Tesla (without whom you could not read this ie your monitor has a Tesla coil in it to get it to work) has been all but forgotten.<br>
<br>
   <br>
TESLA, Nikola (1856-1943), Electrical inventor.  Born in Yugoslavia.  Educated at the polytechnical school at Graz and at the University of Prague.  Worked as Telephone engineer in Prague and Paris.  Conceived new type of electric motor having no commutator, as D.C. motors have, but works on the principle of rotating magnetic fields produced by polyphase alternating currents.   He found no one interested in Europe so he came to the U.S in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison.  Edison made promises that he refused to keep so after a short time Telsa Established his own lab and obtained patents on polyphase motors , Dynamos, Transformers, for a complete A.C. power system.  Forming an alliance with George Westinghouse and engaged in a struggle against Edison to convince the public of the efficiency and safety of A.C. power over that of D.C. power.  Edison who was a proponent of D.C. sought to destroy Tesla’s reputation and debunk the validity of A.C. power.  Public opinion was turned to Telsa’s side when at the Chicago Worlds Fair, Tesla introduced the Tesla Coil and fired “lighting bolts” into the crowd safely.  With the funding of Westinghouse behind him he built the Niagara Falls hydroelectric power plant that is still in operation today.   As funding from Westinghouse ran out, JP Morgan financed Tesla for his continuing experiments.  Tesla wanted to find away to provide free power to the world and in the early 1900’s had found out the method to do this.  JP Morgan discovered that Tesla was planning on providing free electricity to the world and withdrew his funding.  Very few patents were obtained the final years of Tesla’s life due to lack of funding, and he died privately and peacefully at 87 in a New York hotel room from no apparent cause in particular.  More than 2000 people attended his funeral. <br>
<br>
The list of inventions of Tesla:<br>
The Loudspeaker, The Polyphase Induction Motor (the motor that runs off A.C. power), The Hydroelectric Generator, Radio (Marconi’s patent was over turned in 1943 due to Tesla filed his patent several years earlier), X-rays (again Roentgen filed his patent long after Telsa had discovered this), Vacuum Tubes, Fluorescent Lights , Microwaves, Radar, A.C. Power (both 2 phase and 3 phase). Broadcast Power, The Rotary Engine,  and The Telsa Coil.  <br>
The Smithsonian due to Thomas Edison being its primary sponsor in its creation does not recognize Tesla’s work’s.<br>
The most visible events from this Hero of Electricity is a man made earthquake that was a result of Tesla attempting to discover the natural resonance of the earth and vibrating a steam driven oscillator at the same frequency as the ground beneath him.  And the world largest Lighting Bolt near his Colorado Springs lab.  Tesla had sent waves of energy through the earth and amplifying it everytime it bounced back to the generator.  He was attempting to charge the earths surface with electricity to provide cheap power to the world, unfortunately the power station could not support the load that he was placing on it and burn it out. The result was a 130 foot wide lighting bolt that lit the entire valley in a ‘St. Elmos’ type blue glow.  The Accompanying thunder was heard 22 miles away.  <br>
<br>
Due to Smithsonian, Edison, and the media at large Tesla has all but disappeared from history books.  I ask that you look these facts up yourself.  There are several websites dedicated to Tesla from people who wish to give credit to the greatest mind since De Vinci.  He had the worlds first Remote control boat in the 1800’s.  He had theories on Nuclear Fusion and Fission ( though he thought that nuclear fission was far too dangerous and the by products would be a serious threat.)   There are witnesses to Tesla having invented a Particle Beam that could disable a plane in flight at 250 miles out, and was only limited to the line of sight.  His papers disappeared soon after his death having been impounded by the US government, and though a few have appeared in the Tesla museum most are still missing.  The FBI files that are available for viewing at WWW.FBI.GOV state that the papers were possible obtained by a foreign government.<br>

I knew Tesla was the man, but had no idea he was a d00d!  Now I'm gonna look for stuff on him.  I'm a big physics freak, and have a degree in electronics, so this stuff is great fun to me.<br>

I still think that the blast in Russia in the early part of the 20th century was one of Tesla's experiments and not a Comet like some think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, yes Tesla was a great man with great ideas and more people should read about him and his work.<br>

The FBI files (which I burned 3 tanks of ink to print) state there was a nephew connected to the Russian government that may have taken the documents.  The FBI denies that they have any of the papers, though they did confirm that a &quot;Black Box&quot; was missing from Tesla's belongings.   Teslas assistant believes that was the particle beam weapon Tesla had invented yet refused to part with.  The weapon reportedly was able to fire electrons from a electron emitter similar to that used in your TV sets.  There was a special design to it that to this date we have not been able to duplicate.<br>
 <br>
Oh By the way .. Tesla also discovered Quarks- something that wasn't rediscovered until the late 1970's.<br>
