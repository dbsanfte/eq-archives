Why am I sitting way out here and so far from all the other lvl 50's in our guild.  So i do a check to see who all is online.  I see a few lvl 50's and a few higher end 40's.  No surprise, they're in all parts of the world.  So i have to ask, 'why are we all spread thin over the world?'  Why aren't we all grouping up together?  We don't have any conflicts with each other and most often we're on at the same time.  So i am making this proposal:  The lvl 50's of this guild should get together and do some serious grouping in the more reserved regions of Norrath.  How often do we hang out by ourselves in Sebilis, Velketor's Labrynth, or the Hole?  Most of us all either want or need items from these zones for personal use, quests, or for market sales.  In the past we have been too few in number to actually consider making these kinds of groups.  Now that some of us have gotten our characters to this lvl, it's time to wreak some serious havoc on the inhabitants of the deepest, darkest parts of Norrath.  I don't want to sound power hungry or greedy, but i'm wearing a lot of the same equipment at 52 that i was at 32.  It's time to get some new toys.  And i know that i'm not the only one.  I have gone ahead and made plans to begin implementing this idea immediately, starting TOMORROW night, July 31st, at 6pm central in the Hole.  Please submit your suggestions for other grouping ideas whenever you think them up.  I hope that this post brings in some good responses.  This could be our best attempt at alleviating the constant problems of not being able to join in groups at our lvl in zones that we want to hunt in.  This would also be a great time to explore zones that none of us have gone to.  I would really like to venture out to the Western Wastes or maybe the Howling Stones.  And i'm going to make a special request.  To Kaymar, you are, i believe, the highest lvl person in our guild.  If you would like to come along with us, that'd be fantastic.  If not, then please share your experience with us.  Let us know what were in for when going to these kinds of places.  I look forward to hearing all your comments and ideas on this subject.<br><br>Ghoulik Bloodmoon,<br>Lvl 52 Heretic<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uwhorlwinnd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whorl Winnd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b><font color=yellow>RA Council Member</font><br><font color=blue>Administrator<b></span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/30/01 11:23:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=522.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: For the 50+ crowd</span><hr size=1> Actually, we did just this, tonight.  Uriel and I were bored (as usual), so we met up with Aggies Shadowknight(Ack! I forgot his name!), Gwion, and Korran to rid Lower Guk of it's King.  We met Ethrond as we arrived in Guk, and he joined us in our battles.  The way to the King was going very well, almost perfect, even right up to the King.  Alas, I commited a cardinal Monkey sin of not waiting long enough to see if I was clear of aggro before going to join in the fight.  As I was bashing away on the King, my screen filled with blue words of "Add", many times.  The party was wiped out with the exception of the Monks.  Luckily, a wonderful Cleric, whom I also can't recall the name of at this time, was gracious enough to rez our party, and everyone basked in the glow of 90 percent worth of, "You have regained some experience!"  <br><br>  Soon after the wipeout, we met up with the King, yet again.  He fell easily to our combined might, this time.  Some time later on another King fight, we were forced to Evacuate because of an unidentified Froggie Healer somewhere nearby.  We all considered it a success after that, as we broke up and went our separate ways, mostly to sleep...hehe.  <br><br>  Much loot was had during the evening, but the important thing was that all involved had tons of fun.  It was great bringing some of the more "outdoorsy" people(mainly Gwion, hehe) deep into a dungeon, to parts they've never seen.  I'm afraid Uriel has developed FBSS envy after having tried one out...expect to see him negotiating for one in East Commons very soon.  Finally, I've always said that there are few things a Monk can't pull singly, but tonight proved that there is nothing that two Monks can't bring in alone..(/cheer Ethrond)<br> <p><b><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=74483 target="web"><font color=blue>Whorl Winnd</font></a><BR>51st Season Human Disciple<BR>Morell-Thule<BR>[Random Acts] of Kindness!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uhumae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Humae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member<br><font color=red>Blurred Medal of Alcohol Tolerance</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/31/01 12:02:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=522.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: For the 50+ crowd</span><hr size=1> THATS IT!!!

In a single group we could try the front area again, stopping at the golem... having hunted past there now I know there's no easy way beyond him.<br><br>If you pass the golem there's no way to get back up (going into the castle = instadeath unless you clear out below it first) unless you gate or port.<br><br>Down on the floor of the pit (just past the golem) are a few static spawns (I think 5) and a castle that can be pulled from. The main problem with that is there are numerous (lots and lots and lots) of golems in there and our puller could not garuntee single golems every time. That means with just 1 group we'd get squished if 2 golems came (some of them DO go up to 54th level).<br><br>So...

Random Acts is finally starting to grow. Even though Random Acts is one of the slowest lvling guilds in the game that's not the point, we are a guild who go around doing good and having fun, lvling is just extra. I mean, come on, since Meriel was 28 when I joined Random, now she's a lil over 10 lvls higher, I have gotten to 36 with 1 warrior, and have 2 lvl 21 characters. This is with almost 2 months of not playing. But even with this very slow progress in Random Acts, slow progress is still progress and ppl are finally hitting the 50+ marks. <br><br>In reality, 1 group just doesn't cut it when you're lvl 55. This is one of those reasons I really respect Kaymar for sticking it out with Randoms (besides her uber jewelery). The whole point of being lvl 50+ is to quest and get better equipment. But if you check around, uber guilds like triune, relentless, heroic, thunder, and reviction are all raiding temple of vesheen and they have a lot of ppl who are just a little over 50. They equipment they get is a lot different than the ones we have access to, and from what I know from my spies in triune and heroic, they work out loot only in guild so that in Random Acts if a lvl 50+ would want to go to temple of Vesheen to get his/her kael armor it's simply not possible cuz no other guild would take him/her and 1 group even with all lvl 60 would still get massacred in there.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is even that we are not a pwr lvling guild or raiding guild, we still need to start checking out the higher end raidings. I've seen lots of raids planned to benefit the lvl 20's and 30's to simple places, but I've yet to see any higher lvl raids, (even the only naggy raid failed)...<br><br>From what I know of the uber guilds, their system works, you log on, you ask in guild chat for a group and ppl going to seb, or cobalt, or any high lvl place just lists the classes still needed. There planned raids are also very organized, and to tell you the truth, it is during these raids where everyone works together that the real bonding between the guild works out. <br><br>I believe even though we are a more or less friendly guild, our leaders should start taking a little more charge and consider having more direction, not saying we should get rid of the fun, but maybe the orientation should change a bit. I dun wanna get to lvl 50 and then when I wanna go to get a seb key have to ask friend that aren't even in this guild for help.<br><br>---ALL HAIL THE ELVEN RACES---<br>-Dhameon Ebonyfist, Half-Elven Warrior of the 36th Battle.<br>-Angelus Linyus, High-Elven Wizard of the 21st Casting.<br>-Draekon (?), Wood-Elven Druid of the 21st Circle.<br>-Socrates (?), Dark-Elven Enchanter Lost at Lvl 1.<br>---ALL HAIL THE ELVEN RACES--- <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ukaymarrandomacts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaymar RandomActs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member<br><font color=blue>Olympics Champion</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/1/01 2:27:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=522.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: For the 50+ crowd</span><hr size=1> the original thread has been a bit derailed with this post...anyway :<br><br>I don't think that raid/PL/uber loot/big encounters/insert high-end stuff here/... are what we do.<br>FA camps, Random Acting is what we do and officers are doing a great job on this.<br><br>Concerning the &quot;you ask for a group in guild-chat and head to Velk, Seb...&quot;, you know, you can do it in your own guild chat too.

Me and Ghoulik both (the 52's) got 1.5 blues for several hours of play.<br><br>Better than nothing, yes. Interesting loot, yes but very rare (not just with us).<br><br>My ideas for the Over The Hill, INC. (heehee) are...<br><br>1) Sebilis Keys, not exp or loot just getting together to do the key quest for future use.<br><br>2) Lower Guk named camps. I'm still selfish here, but anything on the AM/Lord hallway is 90% blue exp still (and was quite good at 51, haven't tried at 52 yet). I personally am still camping a Runed Cowl (for Wimbuk) and a Shiney Metallic Robe (also for Wimbuk). With a full group 50+ it would be quite possible to camp the entire AM/Lord hallway area and get steady exp the whole time not to mention a few shots at loot (Lord drops ShortSword of Ykesha and Skull-Shaped Barbute, AM drops SMR and newbie pants).<br>The Sage drops the Runed Cowl (9 int hat) and Cinch Cords (4 int belt) but he's part of the tower which is a lower level area (almost entirely green now). However, if we're going on an item hunt the tower has 5 spawns we could camp at once including the Executioner (Exe Hood, Exe Axe), Sage (Runed Cowl, Cinch Cords), Savant (Adamantite Epolauts, ?), Cavalier (Dark Reaver, Enameled Black Breastplate), and Assasin.<br><br>3) Solusek B, deep bugs spawn / imps / efreeti area. These things are blue until 54 or higher, plus a few decent loots drop down there including the Golden Efreeti Boots if we're patient enough to camp them. Also an item I want for Wimbuk, but any caster in their right mind wants those boots hehe (9int 9wis <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br><br>4) Velks Lab would be interesting, I've still never been.<br><br>And if all else fails hehe...<br><br>5) Seafury Island, OOT. Steady pulls, steady exp, couple of money loot items. People mostly solo on the island, it might be interesting to bring a full 50+ group and see if we could clear the whole thing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Plus, while there hunting, we could keep an eye on the AC camp if it ever opens up and maybe get someone started on their JBooties. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Just some thoughts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><hr align="center" width="80%" size="2"><center><table width="98%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" border="1">  <tr><td align="center"><font size="2"><b>Balamur</b><BR><font size="1">52nd Cleric of Brell</i></td><td align="center"><font size="2"><b>Wimbuk</b><BR><font size="1">38th Clockwork Mage</i></td><td align="center"><font size="2"><b>Aldrec</b><BR><font size="1">32nd Northman Warrior</i></td><td align="center"><font size="2"><b>Zickt</b><BR><font size="1">22nd Swifttail Monk</i></td><td align="center"><font size="2"><b>Drizek</b><BR><font size="1">22nd Teir'Dal Bonecaster</i></td><td align="center"><font size="2"><b>Wembuk</b><BR><font size="1">11th Halfer Drood</i></td>  </tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ukaymarrandomacts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaymar RandomActs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member<br><font color=blue>Olympics Champion</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/1/01 9:00:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=522.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: For the 50+ crowd</span><hr size=1> Mohahaaaaa !!<br><br>we have discovered (strong word for a little thing) a technique to have more pulls at ledge without having to fall.<br>got no-rest pulling with a full 52 - 55 group. <br>got 1.5 blue at 55.<br><br>but I won't tell ya !<br>Lalalaalaaaaaa !<br>I woooOOoooonnn't teeeeeell yaaaAAAaaaa !!<br>/tease /tease<br><br>Hint : you can't get up once you have fallen, but mobs can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>I think you get it. <p><img src="http://www.morosa.f9.co.uk/kaymar.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uwhorlwinnd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whorl Winnd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b><font color=yellow>RA Council Member</font><br><font color=blue>Administrator<b></span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/1/01 9:19:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=522.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: For the 50+ crowd</span><hr size=1> LOL, we discussed this Kaymar, about the MOBS warping to you after you aggro em down the hole.
