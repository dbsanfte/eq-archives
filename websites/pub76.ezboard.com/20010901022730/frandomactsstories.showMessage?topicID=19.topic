(part 1 of 3)</span><hr size=1> Hello,<br>
<br>
That trip across Antonica at 2am was so inspiring that i felt like writing it up. And ill rolepla a bit too, as well as exagerate some... GONNA BE LONG but exciting!<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
It all started on bruising hot day in the Desert of North Ro where it feels like the sun never goes down. I looked up at the sky as my eyes got scorched by the bright ball of fire after running around the Desert for a few hours looking for a group to hunt Dervish Cuttthroaghts with.<br>
<br>
When there was nothing else left for me to do on the endless sands, I headed towards Freeport hoping to find some activity to take my mind off the heat. Just as i stepped over a quite large dune so did a Giant Scarab Beetle. It startled me so much i jumped back and ended up rolling end over end down that giant dune. As i lay there with sand in EVERY hole of my body and my face flat in the sand, I thought to myself, it's time to go home!<br>
<br>
I prepared quickly by buying minimal food and requirements to make the trip less straining on my Barbarian bones. I sat at the face of the tunnel in East Commons SoWing that few that walked by and saying my goodbyes to my friends there and asking for luck by my guildmates. <br>
<br>
When Boebes poped out of nowhere with a sad and tired face, i knew she wanted to head home as well. I asked her if she would like to join me on my journey that would be the best experience i have ever had on Norrath since my friends and i stole some of Doc's Cigar's in Halas and mysteriously got sick the next mourning.<br>
<br>
We set of right away, heading towards the Druid Circle in West Commons for a bit of rest and try to get a Teleport instead of running to Qeynos. No one would think of teleporting us...<br>
<br>
After 2 minutes Boebes and I arrived at the Druid Ring and sat down since we needed to wait till morning to travel through the dreaded Kithicor Woods. I sat meditating while Boebes read Norrathian Magazine she had picked up somewhere. Almost as soona s i sat down i heard a familiar voice say "hail!" and i knew right away that is was a friendly being, it was Gwion! We all chatted for a moment when in the distance, i saw a small winged animal come closer, closer, and closer...<br>
<br>
As it got not more than 30 feet away i immediatly shouted "Griffon!!!!!!" and we all ran to safety as it played around the Druid Ring as if it were bragging it were better than us. We all then saw a truely powerful Druid come up to it and confront it, i thought he was doomed but by the first spell he cast the Griffon was replying by "All hail to my master..." I laughed, and thinking of when the Griffon would loose its "Charm" I laughed some more.<br>
<br>
As we were all calm again since the Griffon would be tamed for a while Boebes and I sat down at the Druid Circle to rest for the trip that would behold us tomorrow. As Gwion and a friend went to kill wisps. <br>
<br>
I dont know who said it but not long after we sat down i heard a voice say "griffon!" near us. I immediatly got up and looked RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE as that foolish "charming" Druid ran by with a not so friendly Griffon as his backside trying to get revenge for what he had done earlier.<br>
<br>
"Phew!" we were all happy it didnt stop to confront us. Boebes and i decided it would be safer if we rested at the edge of Kithicor Woods. So we ran together again and stuck to the right hill that seperated the Commonlands from Nektulos. I stopped to look back at Boebes and make sure she was still there. Just then i saw the most horrific Hill Giant alive right behind her.<br>
<br>
Thanks to its poor eyesite it never spotted us. But it stood there for a few minutes as we both stood stunned ourselves. I dont know what happened to Boebes but she wouldnt move, i ran to the side she jsut stood there! Maybe she was frozen of excitement, maybe she was a brave girl, and maybe she took out her "photo taking device" and got some shots of it. Thank goodness the Hill Giant finally ran off as it seemed forever as it stood there!<br>
<br>
We then set off again and the Woods were about 150 feets away! As we got there we noticed we had an hour to spare and that we should rest for a while. We both sat down and did our small activities that amuse us when we have nothign else to do. Then the impossible happened...<br>
<br>
I had suddenly felt my body shiver as my head began to hurt. I looked at Boebe and said "oh crap" and another shock hit me and my head hurt more! I knew i was to be doomed as this has happened to others before. Shock after shock i soon lost sight of Boebes and not a soul was there with me!  I couldnt hear, i couldnt smell, i couldnt taste, and soon i couldnt see anything. My brain had gone "linkdead" from the World of Norrath...<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
That was part 1 of what will probably be 3 parts... i hope you enjoyed that and i will add 2 more parts later. Guess what, this is all true!Well stay tuned!<br>
<br>
Journey Safe,<br>
