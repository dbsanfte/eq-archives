<br>
I play a character named Spydaer, currently a lvl 14 High Elf mage.  (Currently busy doing my best to rid the dervs of NRO of all their bronze weapons)  I have met several Random Act members, and have grouped with several in my short existance.  I have found them to be patient and helpful, which is important to me since I am a pretty raw player.  My mage is the only person I have, and I don't know many people or much about the game other what I have seen so far.  (I know the boat ride was not nearly horror story people made it out to be to me, and I even caught lots of fish..chuckle)<br>
<br>
Being a mage, I am going to have a hard time being as helpful as others can be, since I can't buff or heal others.  What I can do, and what I've been doing, is collecting bone chips and spider silks and giving them away to fellow group members who needed/wanted them.  (For my usual fee.....Free...grin)  <br>
<br>
I have read the guidelines on how to join, and I am little concerned about the &quot;help the newbie&quot; portion, since as of yet I have seen noone who is less experienced than me.  I have seen people lower levels, but they always have a &quot;big brother&quot;/&quot;Big Sister&quot;.  I will of course do my best.<br>
<br>
So, I am knocking on the door, hoping to be let in.<br>

The best places I've seen to find true newbies are Qeynos and Erudin.  In Queynos I find them most often near the docks, usually a nekked human walking (stress walking) around aimlessly or an erudite that followed a higher level across on the boat.  In Erudin I usually see them walking around the library.<br>
<br>
We realize that you are still relatively new to the game but at this point you already know alot more about the game than you did when you first started and any words of advice or assistance to a n00b is generally greatly appreciated.  Alot of times you have to start by just teaching them how to talk in /tell.  That in itself opens up a whole new aspect of the game to them.  Other rhings like explaining to them how to change their view (F9 and F10) helps out.  I usually take them on a little tour of the strange new town that they suddenly showed up in, show them where to get food, where their guild is, the bank (very important), teach them how to fight and interact with NPCs.  <br>
<br>
Send me a tell in game tonite and we can discuss this further if you'd like.<br>

<br>
I'm so very glad you found us!  My name is Emerest and I look forward to meeting you in Norrath soon.  We are fortunate, as a guild, in that we have members covering virtually every level, from 1 through and including 60!  Consequently, you will have plenty of opportunity to meet and group with RA members!<br>
<br>
I am generally in Norrath in the evenings (after 10pm Central USA).  I will be on the lookout for you. We can chat (I love to talk about RA, who we are and what we do!), and we can talk about finding a sponsor for you.  Your sponsor will help guide you through the Fledgling process (including working with you to complete that first quest!).  I also encourage you to seek a few of us out (/who Random will get you a list of any of us currently in your zone).  And feel free to look for me (a /who all Emerest will tell you where I am!).<br>
<br>
When you get a chance, please let us know the times you are most likely to be found in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Thank you for applying!  Talk to you soon! <p><table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img

<br>
Thank you for applying for membership of our guild and may I take this opportunity to wish you success in your application. <br>
<br>
We have an application procedure that you will be required to complete in order to enter into full membership of the guild. I have listed the steps below.<br>
<br>
1. Apply in this forum (check!)<br>
<br>
2. Read the Call and Charter. <br>
The Call and Charter detail the principles that our Guild are based upon and to proceed you should be in broad agreement with them. You can find details of them at www.eqrandomacts.com. Also reading our Mission Statement and Ethical Guidelines to see what we are all about is important as learning as much about who we are and what we are about will help you make an informed decision about joining us.<br>
<br>
3. Attend Random Acts Events<br>
There are three main reasons for this, it is fun, you get to meet lots of guild members and most importantly you will need to seek out a sponsor. Details of upcoming events can be found on this message board under Events, Hunting and Gathering.<br>
<br>
4. Find a Sponsor <br>
A sponsor is a regular guild member that will mentor you through the fledgling quest/community service and support you in your application. It is also hoped that you will form a special relationship with your sponsor. Your sponsor will also be responsible for you. You can find who is on at any one time by typing the command &lt;/who all random&gt; <br>
(Note: Guild members can sponsor more than one fledgling.)<br>
<br>
5. Perform Fledgling Quest or Community Service quest<br>
Details of the quest can be found at www.eqrandomacts.com and you can perform either one with the assistance and advice of your sponsor.<br>
<br>
6. Guild Tagging <br>
Upon successful completion of your Quest, your sponsor must notify Meriel Silvertree or Gwion Llwellyn either by posting here on the board, or through a tell in game, you will then receive your Random Acts Tag at the next scheduled First Aid Camp (FA).<br>
First Aid Camps are generally held every two weeks, the first one on a Saturday, and the next one on a Sunday.<br>
<br>
7. Probationary Membership<br>
Probationary Membership will last until you attend the *next* regularly scheduled FA and barring any difficulties you will be accepted into the guild as a full member.<br>
<br>
8. Alternate Characters<br>
You will be able to have one alternate character tagged every two weeks.<br>
<br>
The road is long Fledgling, but you will find assistance, advice and kindness upon the way. <br>
<br>
If you have any difficulties you may contact me at morgyra@aol.com or the council at eqrandomacts@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Be proactive and seek out guild members near you both in Norrath and here upon the boards. <br>
<br>
For our records it would be helpful if you could provide us with details of your name, class, race, level, playing times, and e-mail address if you have not yet done so. <br>
<br>
Safe journeys to you,  <br>
<br>

<br>
On Wipl's suggestion, I walked from Freeport to Queynos, in a quest to find someone new.  This wasn't as easy as it sounds, since I had never set before in East Com, West Com, Kith, HH, or any of the Karanas in my life.  Finally, after wearing my shoes out, I arrived, and set to trying to explore the city.  (Thinking I wouldn't be very helpful if I didn't know where anything else was either)<br>
<br>
Of course, I promptly got lost, and I have decided Queynos is the worst city on the planet.  (Which I find interesting, since I read many think it is a great place to start).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, after exploring for 20-30 mins, went back to the Queynos gate.  I than saw I was the ONLY person in Queynos...chuckle.  After several minutes, several lvl 1 people showed up...a lvl 1 halfling and a 1 lvl 1 woodelf.  Since I wasn't born yesterday, I kind of assumed anyone here who wasn't a lvl 1 human in all likelyhood wasn't a newbie.  <br>
<br>
OK...decided to try my luck again in Freeport, and walked all the way back.  (Only getting confused for a little while in HH this time).  Nothing doing upon arrival, but I figure I'll try again tomorrow.<br>
<br>
This is tough, but I am getting more knowledgeable.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uwiplshaman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WiplShaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/24/01 5:17:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=474.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Much worse than I thought</span><hr size=1> Spydaer I'm really sorry that you were unable to find a newbie in Qeynos especially since I had personally seen at least 5 earlier that day.

I don't have a problem with him sponsoring you especially since you two are more comparable in levels.

Perhaps we can come up with some other project  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>

In any event, I don't want you to become frustrated, thinking that this is an impossible task.  Certainly the tenacity you've shown already in just trying to complete the quest says something!  Walking from Freeport to Qeynos -- and then back again!  Yikes!<br>

<br>
I know you will miss the next upcoming FA camp (scheduled for this Saturday, January 12).  I hope you'll be able to join us for the following one, which should be held on Sunday, January 27.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, feel free to join in any of the upcoming events and hunts.  See what's going on on the Events Board!<br>
