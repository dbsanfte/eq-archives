She could tell it had once been something more, and wanting to see more, slowly opened the cracked door.<br>
<br>
The bar had once been glorious, that she could sense. She could hear the echoes of ghosts, the singing, the laughter, and she sensed something... ominous about. Was it this thing that led to the decay of the place? Whatever had happened? <br>
<br>
She ran a hand over the bar, dust rising up, making her eyes squint, and her nose tickle. She sneezed a moment, and again, and then again, then sniffed, taking out a white hanky and holding it to her face. "Phew, dust. And... sweat.. and... Tunare, what in Norrath is this about??" <br>
<br>
Xanta had smelled this smell before, when a body was too long gone. Only once had she worked the magic to bring back someone that far gone, but that had been different- that was love. She smiled at the thought of her fiance. He must be looking for her now, surely he was. And surely would he find her.<br>
<br>
Stepping behind the bar, she went through the bottles. A bit of rum, a bit of vodka, a few drops of wine, some brandy. She poured the last of some white wine into a goblet she'd pulled down from a rack, dusting it in her underskirts. <br>
<br>
Hopping up on the bar, thinking to bring some magic back, she began a slow song, a hum, almost, hoping, perhaps in vain, to bring back some of the folk. She was no bard, but she was a cleric, perhaps song could heal up this place, bring back a proper barmaid and tender, some old companions, old friends, and she sang, with the hope they'd follow the sound...<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><i>Through storms and long nights<br>
You were there,<br>
I followed you.<br>
Days I was lost without you,<br>
You followed through.<br>
I didn't mean to get so far, away.<br>
I thought you'd always be around,<br>
In your arms I thought I'd find home.<br>
<br>
There was no other place to be,<br>
No fire warmer than your heart<br>
I'd rather be.<br>
No adventure would keep me away,<br>
From you,<br>
As your love is the only journey<br>
I want to make.<br>
<br>
Around and around we go,<br>
Where we'd stop,<br>
Nobody knows,<br>
But may we always come back,<br>
To the place we were,<br>
Finding you, finding me.</center></i><br>
<br>
The song faded out, she hummed a bit, the melody catching in her head. She thought of the folks she had heard of coming here, and realized, ahhhh, it made sense, yes...<br>

Had that been a light in the window of the old building near Kithicor?<br>
The next day, his short legs pumping with the Spirit of the Wolf, he passed through deadly Kithicor back into the Commonlands.  Surely he had been mistaken, a play of moonlight upon darkened glass.<br>
<br>
But there it stood, The Missed Note.  A thin line of smoke rising from the chimney and the faint sounds of singing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Xanta?&quot;  Dorraxx poked his head in the door as memories flashed through his head.  Had it been that long?<br>
<br>
The High Elven Cleric was moving about the main room, wiping away some of the dust and cobwebs that had gathered over the months.  He watched her, mesmerized momentarily at her grace as she stepped lightly from the tables to the bar and back.  She carried a glass of wine in one hand and was singing a lilting tune he didn't recognize.  It was no wonder she had won Darkmask's heart.<br>
&quot;Xanta?&quot;  <br>
She turned toward the doorway and smiled.  &quot;Dorraxx!&quot;  She motioned him to the various spirits she had gathered from behind the bar. &quot;Join me for a drink?&quot;<br>
He tilted his head and grinned, &quot;Don't mind if I do.&quot;  He approached and, choosing the brandy, poured a glass.<br>
Peering at Xanta, a bemused grin on his face, he asked, &quot;So, what brings ye here?&quot; <p><center><hr size=5, width="55%">

It had been many months since he had been by and many months since he had seen his friends.  <br>
<br>
How many still remained he was unsure.  But just as a strong need for isolation drove him away so long ago, I new need for company and the presence of friends now brought him back.<br>
<br>
Walking over the crest of a hill he spotted the Missed Note.  So much like he had first seen it years ago.  He saw smoke trailing from the chimney and hope arose with in.  Would any of his friends still be there, Sasi, Lodach, Myethia, Dorraxx or Kalaz and so many others.  Or would he be walking in on a bunch of strangers who have no memory of him?  Well their was only one way to find out he thought as he made his way down the slope to the cozy inn below.   <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Warenherz</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
His fingers stroked over the gold crest on top of the compass lid, and he flipped it open, he knew this compass though was magical, and didnt tell the owner where north was, but where Xanta was.<br>
<br>
Darkmask was susprised at the magic Xanta had, for a cleric, she always seemed to glow with much more power then healer, and sometimes she would often show him fantastic trinkets. In fact, Darkmask was battering for class v gnomish batteries for Xanta now.<br>
<br>
He watched as Ping Fuzzlecutter showed him his supply and talked and talked like most gnomes do, explaining how the mana in the air was compressed into these small boxes and could be discharged through contact with certain metals..Darkmask didnt really understand what tinkerers did, but he loved their toys.<br>
<br>
Gathering a few more tinkered items from Ping, he worked out a price, and paid the little man. Flipping the compass open, it glowed with blue power, and pointed Darkmask to the commonlands.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to create commotion and attract the guards of freeport, Darkmask surrounded himself in a cloak of invisibility, his magic was ackward now, it didnt flow like it used before his...death in Droga, it was almost like he didnt have the magic in him, but was now borrowing it from someone, he worried if the person he pulled on felt his tug every spell he cast.<br>
<br>
Entering the open hills of the commons, Darkmask headed towards the druid ring, figuring his love might be there, healing, and tending to wounds, but she wasnt in sight. He flipped open his compass and she appeared to be further on, this was not unexpected as she often wandered and followed the occasional animal, she was so curious and sometimes got lost in nature itself, she was truely a child of Tunare.<br>
<br>
As his eyes were watching the compass, he came over a hill, to see a sight he hadnt seen in years...The Missed Note....it was lit up...<br>
<br>
Quickly he dropped his spell,and hastened his pace, thinking of seeing his friends again, he heard tales of them, but to see them again, how glorious would that be....<br>
<br>
Darkmask smiled to himself, thinking of Harte, Sasi, Pikel, Thistleburr, Vandaal, Gulasx, the Myth, Dorraxx, Radgen, Len, even Ninou...so many faces he had long missed, so many lives he felt he lost contact with.....<br>
<br>
He heard singing as he came to the window, he knew it to be his love, her voice is unlike that of any other woman, sweet, stirring and magical, Darkmask stopped to see her, to watch her, she was amazing....a smile crossed his face.....<br>
<br>
He heard a voice he hadnt heard in quite awhile inside, the gruff voice of Dorraxx, he knew it well, as Dorraxx was considered something of a wise advisor whom was sought out for his council and fair judgement, Darkmask remembered well the nights he stayed up discussing matters with him, and how when everyone though Darkmask took advantage of Ninou, he was there to temper their anger and see the situation for what it was....<br>
<br>
....he slid the compass into his pocket and entered the Missed Note.... <p><center>

Always before she had turned away at the door.. uncertain as to whether she would be welcome.<br>
<br>
Laughter spilled out through the window, beckoning her.. How can I go right in, I am lost to these people..? Sighing, she pulled her cloak tightly about her and turned to continue past, as she always did..her staff drooping slightly.<br>
<br>
A thought struck her..so long ago it seemed, that she had silently stood in the shadows, straining to overhear the glorious stories of her lost dragon.. hoping against hope that he would return to her. Mayhaps, she thought, I could go in.. just for a moment.. <br>
<br>

Curious, Animaetrix is spending time in West Commonlands. A unusual haunt for her, something must be drawing her there. <br>
<br>
As I continue my search, I can't help but wonder why she is there. Usually I can account for the reason, but this time I am stumped. I must know, or it will forever bother me. I open my worn spell book, turning to a page that has seen more use then any other page. Slowly I memorize the spell Ring of Commons, a destination all too familiar to me. As I memorize the spell I think back to my many adventures in the Commonslands.<br>
<br>
Slowly I cast the spell, wondering what I may find there, hoping I will soon know. <p><center>

How she wished The Missed Note still stood open and inviting as it once had.<br>
<br>
She remembered her short stint as a waitress there and her first meeting with Radgen, Dorraxx, Myethia, Harte, Sasi, Darkmask and others.  Her first night there had been a harsh one....She had healed a chanter who had been Harm Touched by a sleeping SK who had screamed while having a nightmare.  She had been so young back then...and had since learned so much.<br>
<br>
She strolled through the commons towards Kithicor knowing she had to make it through the woods before nightfall or camp on this side for a night.  But oh how she wanted a good wine this night and a soft bed.  <br>
<br>
She looked ahead of her and a small wisp of smoke arose on the horizon wear the Missed Note once stood...<br>
<br>
"It can't be possible.  Can it?" Lodach thought to herself as her feet changed direction and followed the smoke.  She entered the old cleared and sure enough there was the Note with signs of life coming from its doors.  She couldn't believe it and stood silently looking at it from the distance.<br>
<br>
Finally as the shock left her she found herself approuching the door and pushing it open as she once had, so long ago.  With an impish greeting she pushed open the door, "Hello, who did this?  Who awoken the spirit of the Note once more?"<br>
<br>
She looked around and saw some familiar faces and smiled happily.<br>
<br>
"Omg darlings....any chance there is a room availalbe for a few nights for a retired waitress of this place?"<br>

She wore a ring, set with a dull gem..it had not before appealed to anyone but herself, and no one knew why she bothered with it. As the door swung open, the jewel began to glow, sputtering as though it were out of practice. Her eyes widened and she leapt to her feet, knocking her staff to the ground in her haste.<br>

She turned slowly around and faced the newcomer, as she drew close the ring burned brightly.. a magical sapphire that pulsated with a bright blue flame as she approached him. She slipped her cloak back to her shoulders and stared at him.<br>

Perhaps you are better at finding things to mix and drink than I, I'm merely a cleric,&quot; Xanta shrugged. &quot;But for now, you may want to find a place for that armour, perhaps there would be one to polish it up for you, or replace it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And Lodach,&quot; Xanta blushed, &quot;I, ummm, found myself a bit,&quot; here Xanta turned a toe in the dirt, blushing again, &quot;lost.. but I found this place, and I couldn't resist! I remember bumping into it some time ago, but I only peeped through the windows.. When I found it empty, I thought to explore a bit, and I really have found some interesting things, things leading of course to more queries on my part,&quot; Xanta smiled, hoping perhaps Lodach had some of these answers, and she explained briefly about what she'd felt about the place.<br>
<br>
&quot;As to answer your questions, Kesryn, about what we wish of you.. hmmm, well, I suppose it'd be a lovely thing to share your company a while. While you may not remember myself, I do remember you, and what a pleasant fellow you were!&quot; Xanta smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;This be The Missed Note,&quot; she continued, &quot;Perhaps while you were lost, you found this! Destiny has a funny way of putting us where we are most needed, I've found, I'd wager a guess that you have answers and questions, both to be shared and pondered here. So, about that drink... what have you?&quot;<br>

His eyes rolled over the armor, now dulled and seeming to no longer carry a life of their own, something had changed with the Dragon Lord, the protector appointed by the gods.<br>
<br>
Kesryn stood like a noble high elf, staring Darkmask right back as Darkmask circled him, his robes sweeping in a circle behind him. The patrons watched unsure of what was going to happen, as Darkmask's head swept behind Kesryn he seemed to have a scowl on his face, but as he came around, a broad smile danced across his face and Darkmask patted Kesryn on the shoulder, " Welcome Dragon Lord, have you met my fiancee' Xanta " Darkmask knew full well she greeted him, but wanted to point out the word fiancee' to the Dragon Lord as was common among high elves to establish relationship grounds and to make it clear that her hand was taken.<br>
<br>
Darkmask ran to his bags, and dug through them, in a hurried manner, removing a hard bound book, he flipped a few pages and found the sketch. He showed Kesryn like an eager young child hoping Kesryn would recognize it.....he watched as the Dragon Lord traced his finger around the lines of the image, and pushed the sketch away.<br>
<br>
Confused, Darkmask decided not to press it anymore, sweeping behind Xanta, dropping the sketch book on the counter and wrapped his arms around her waist, and kissed her cheek.<br>
<br>
This was actually not done by high elves, public displays of affection are not common among the high elves, but Darkmask couldnt help himself, she just made him glow and electricty flowed from her into him. Xanta kissed his cheek back and rubbed the back of his head and slowly slipped from his grasp so she could serve some drinks.<br>
<br>
She looked back at him and eyed him, and smiled, he knew the look, all too well, he had seen it many times since droga and remembers it one time he saw it in Karnor's castle, she was pouring Dorraxx a little more to drink. " Darkmask, dear, I am quite famished would there be any chance you could make me something in the kitchen? " <br>
<br>
Darkmask eager to please, grabbed an apron and dissapeared into the kitchen to Dorraxx giggling, " That is the day, a woman who actually whipped Darkmask " to which Xanta giggled and bumped him with the side of her thigh and said " Shhhhhh, hes all mine and its wonderful, dont be jealous "<br>
<br>
To which Dorraxx turned towards the wall and muttered himself somethings about how he wasnt jealous, and how dwarves are very popular and how he has no reason to be jealous and drink down his ale all the way.<br>
<br>
Standing up very quickly, Dorraxx said, " I am going to get some firewood from out back, no one touch my drink " as he looked around, he considered for a moment, and swept his drink his hand and walked out the door......<br>
