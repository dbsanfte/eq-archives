&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When.......<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have sacrificed my love, my happiness, and even my freedom, but when will someone do the same for me? When will someone free me from this darkness that engulfs my heart? When will someone free me from this cage that I have lived in for so long? When will someone love me for who I am and not for what I have? Will life ever be the same for me? When will I win this battle and end this game?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This life of mine will never be the same. As I sit in my room, the darkness beckons to me. /Come, and I will comfort you./ But what if the darkness is lying ? What if I never stop crying? What if my wounds will never heal? Now it's just emptiness I feel. Will this world ever be the same? When will I be happy again? When will true love ever be revealed? When will I stop hiding? Will I ever stop crying? The darkness is my only hope. When will I be free? I'm already in too deep. I want my curiosity to sleep. When will I get back the blood that has been spilt? When will the guilt in which I feel, become something real? When does the darkness begin to unfold?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I sit on my bed, I cry instead. Then comes the knock on my door. I stare at the floor while I listen to the mesmerizing speech. /You are a piece of trash./ He says. /You are worthless and unclean. I will kill you someday while you sleep./ Then the darkness, it takes over and I can't hear a thing. My tears start to sting, I try to hold them in. And when he's done, he leaves my room with these last words. /You're weak./ And then I fall asleep.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My dreams are just imagination running wild. I picture myself in a world full of love, and parents who seem to care. I stare wide eyed at the ceiling, it's the darkness I am feeling. When will I stop wondering about my life? When will this darkness leave? When will I finally awake and see the light? When will I get rid of this happy mask? It's not an easy task. The darkness, it is revealing to me the truth about love, and the heavens up above. /You are my only hope ./ I say. /Please don't go away./ And then it wraps me up and fills me with emotion. I realize the darkness is my only friend. These feelings I can't contain. /Love does not exist./ I say. /That's why it goes away./ I've never been loved the way darkness loves me. Word for word I never want to love again. /When can I stop hiding?/ I ask. /Never!/ It hisses.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Darkness has finally taken off it's mask. It hisses and no longer do I feel safe. Where is the light that I said no to? I have given my soul to the darkness. I am now heartless. When will I ever change? Will I ever be the same? I want my heart back, I want to think for myself. I want to live again but the darkness is strong. And for it's last request  asks me to remember how it was always there, how it combed my hair with deep concern. And yet again it swallows me from reality. /Darkness is death./ it says, /you will be one with me./ /That is what you meant!/ I screech. /Help me. Please don't take me away. Please don't stay./ I cry now, my only comfort, my last remaining strength is my endless sobs. My life is now in ruins. I don't want to die. I want to live. /But for what?/ it asks. /No one truly loves you./ <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As soon as he says this, there is a knock at my door. And now comes a different speech. /You little b*tch./ He says. /I'm going to kill you./ And as he beats me I can't feel a thing. I smile in wonder as I think I will die. But this time he sobs and says /You are my daughter, what have I done?/ The deep remaining hatred I force upon him with words. You have killed my heart and my soul, now I am unwhole. /I'm dead/ I scream. /What have you done. I'm all alone./ I'm dead and gone, and as I slip away, the darkness has nothing to say.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp /Go into the light, my heart and soul./ When will I ever be whole? Yes, I am still alive and to say so I've tried. Love does not exist. Blood will always be spilt. But still I have my old companion. The darkness it has changed, it no longer controls me.  I am the darkness. I have realized this, my soul is stiff. I will no longer lie to you, for it was my nature before. Love it does not exist, but it always comes with pain. I am no longer your master, you are my friend. The world I am still getting used to. Death is a fact of life, they come and go, but in our hearts they will always remain. Even though they are not with us, they'll always play deaths game.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why did you lie to me? Love, is it really all of the above? Why do I insist on playing with you? You're not even a real toy. Death is just a game, but you lost all the same.<br>
