I was grouped with Bedawin, Sunlir, Meriel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , and Leia, with Razgum arriving a little later.  <br>
<br>
We initially went to the castle, but Random Acts was already there, so we went to the slaver camp.  After about 2 hours there, the ground was slick with orc blood.  We had a VERY solid group.  Once we established our strategy, we made a very good team.  We took very few breaks to rest, lost very little HP overall, and nobody died.  We had some good backup in the form of Gwion, and Dolumar even pulled for a bit, until he wandered off muttering about wolves not being able to use boats.  At times we had 2 or even 3 pullers, because we were killing them too fast.  The highlight (I thought) was when someone trained us with 2 legos and 4 cents (most blue to me at 11).  I was worried at first, but we stuck together and wiped them out in about 90 seconds.  <br>
<br>
I especially enjoyed the chance to lead a team.  I was impressed with the way Gorte led a team in Ro several weeks back, so I modeled my team after his.  I must have paid attention, because we rocked Crushbone.  &lt;happy happy happy dance&gt;<br>
<br>
Let's see...results of the raid: Sunlir made 9th soon after, while turning in belts and pads, I believe.  I almost made 12th.  I tried to get it with Kizor at Nybright camp after the raid, but I had to throw my body between the sisters and Kizor again, so it wasn't meant to be tonight.<br>
<br>
Lessons learned:  don't let Razgum pull.  We had to whack a bard NPC that aggroed him, and we all took the requisite faction hit, but a couple mail quests should fix it right up.<br>
<br>
I heard the other group threw the fear of God into the trainer and there was even a rumor that RA laid the smack down on D'Vinn himself.  This was probably the best night I've had in EQ so far.  I know there will be more.  I've had to scale back my playing time a bit lately, but that just makes nights like this even better.  Kudos to Gwion for coordinating, and thanks for the backup and moral support. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ugwion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gwion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#006400>(8/26/00 1:13:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Crushbone results</span><hr size=1> Aw, thanks, Fin!  You guys did great; you barely needed me.  Well, yeah, for the legos, but besides that you did fine.  And you bring up a good point here -- being able to lead a group is a good skill to have in EQ.  Other players will always want to group with you, no matter your level.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad y'all had a good time, particularly after last week's fiasco (the less said about that one, the better).<br>
<br>
Thanks also go to Dolumar, Tavadelphin and Jellybean for coming along to help out.  Tav arrived just in time to take the teens group to Trainer Hill, where they ruled the place.  Jellybean exhausted his gnomish self with a Breeze cast-a-thon.  Dolumar, how in the name of Tunare did you expect to steer a boat without opposable thumbs?  You have to be in human form, hon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So next week all the 8-10 levels can go to Befallen!  (Put down those rotten veggies, you guys. I am kidding.)  I'll think of someplace.  If anyone has any big ideas, let me know. <p>Gwion <BR> Level, um, 19 <BR> Binding, buffing, and SoWing, and now teleporting my own fool head off all over Norrath!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Sunlir</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#006400>(8/26/00 1:18:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Crushbone results</span><hr size=1> We had a great time. I did make ninth while in crush. After we did a slaver. It was calm enough or we were tough enough to allow me (confidently bringing five spell scrolls in anticiaption of this event) to scribe spells and memorize and cast my first spell ( a light heal on Bedawin or Finrael, I forget which). Raz accidently pulled a rogue by the name of Kelynn of the Tunare Scouts(rogue guild). That is first time I remember seeing the rogue guild in a faction statement. What good things can we do for the Tunare Scouts? <br>
Anyway it was great.<br>

Oh last night at Crushbone was absolutely the best. I was positively IMPRESSED <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  with my hero, Finrael &lt;sigh&gt;. He kept us on track as we decimated those dreadful Orcs. &lt;They definitely aren't so scary now&gt;.<br>
<br>
This guild has been such a great positve in my life in EQ. Everyone has been so helpful to a befuddled little Druid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . From casting SoWs, strengths, binds, offering advice whenever needed, and just being there to greet a stranger, you are showing me how to be helpful to others throughout the land and I'm proud to belong to a guild of such renown. <br>
<br>
I thought I wasn't going to get a chance to reach that 10th level last night after I turned in hard earned CB belts, but the Great Mother Tunare smiled upon me after Sunlir turned in her belts, and the level was granted. *happy-happy dance*. <br>
<br>
Gwion you are terrific in leading our raids and get-togethers and I hope to model myself based upon your great kindnesses.<br>
<br>
I can hardly stay still this morning waiting for the First-Aid to meet my long distance pal, Tevael, and join our members in doing good deeds.<br>
<br>
Meriel<br>
Druid 10 LVL !!!<br>

Now if I can just figure out how NOT to keep running into trees and scraping my skin off as I run thru the mountains. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.showMessage?topicID=64.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.showMessage?topicID=61.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.emailToFriend?topicID=63.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.threadControl?topicID=63.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/sunset/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=63.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=63.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="randomactsfrm6">Fledgling and Prospective Members<option value="randomactsgeneraldiscussion">Guild Roundtable<option value="randomactsfrm8">Hurray for . . .<option value="randomactsmemberinformation">Getting to Know RA<option value="randomactsfrm11">Volunteers of Random Acts<option value="randomactsevents">Hunting and Gathering<option value="randomactsfrm21">Prize Patrol<option value="randomactsstories">The Lore of Norrath: Tips, Skills<option value="randomactsfrm10">Equipment, Spells and Quests<option value="randomactsfrm17">Tech Tips<option value="randomactsfrm9">Adventuring in other Worlds<option value="randomactsfrm23">Members Only<option value="randomactsfrm7">Council and Officer Discussions <option value="randomactsfrm25">I have stuff!<option value="randomactsfrm26">I need stuff!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#006400>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/brandomacts>Random Acts</a><font color=#006400> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsevents>Hunting and Gathering</a> <font color=#006400> - </font><a href="http://www.eqrandomacts.com">Random Acts Website</a><font color=#006400> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
