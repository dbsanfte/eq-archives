This of course started with Tolkien's, The Hobbit and everybody's favorite, the Dragonlance Series.  I think that the Dragonlance series has got to be my favorite all time set of books.<br>
<br>
They are what gave me my world to grow up in.  I was a little nerdy kid.  Not many friends.  Speech impediment...glasses...braces, and damn if my parents didn't dress me funny!!<br>
<br>
These books were my escape.  The table top game Dungeon's and Dragons was great, but nothing like self imagination of diving into a book.  Ever since I was that age, I have been able to imagine myself in various roles.  I spent much of my night time activities reading in my room.  I had several friends, but none seemed to read as much as I did.  Poor lost souls!! haha<br>
<br>
Years past.  The Dragonlance series are still to this day my favorite fantasy reading.  I would always stop and gaze on fantasy art and the like at the hobby stores.  I never lost that part of me.  Again, not many around me understood my love for fantasy.  It was my way to escape stress and to be something I could never be in real life.<br>
<br>
Everquest came to be.  I read about it.  It had been out probably a year when I finally bought the game.  Wise investment.<br>
<br>
To those of you that play the game and love fantasy as much as I do, I salute and bow to you.  You are my brethren.<br>
<br>
To those of you who are able to share the game with loved ones, Neao and his daughter come to mind, as do Gwion and Aganitte..I cheer for you.  I have been trying to get my girlfriend online with me.  She ain't having it.  She just rolls her eyes when she sees me playing the game and gives me that quarky smile of hers.  Would be cool to see her in all leather..hehehe<br>
<br>
When I explain my reasoning for the love of the game, my words fall short.  I can't seem to get my point across.  I know that deep down, it was my need for escape that has built this need for fantasy and in the end, the love of this game and my guild.<br>
<br>
To those of you who are younger and love the game...read.  For those that are older and love the game...read.<br>
If someone were to ask me what they could do to prepare themselves for the worlds that lie ahead.  I would say read.  Imagination is king. <br>
<br>
Escape reality while you can.  <br>

<br>
    I don't know if I can follow up such a great post by Uriel, but I'll try.  &quot; Speech impediment...glasses...braces, and damn if my parents didn't dress me funny!!&quot;, this quote reminds me a lot of myself, in fact this was me back around my junior high days.  I still wear glasses (I'll still will not get contact lenses) and I still have a speech impediment, plus the fact that I live like a hermit.  Who knows, maybe that is why I rarely go out and make social appearances.  However, with this in mind and the fact that I always loved played games, dating back to the commader &lt;sp&gt; 64 and atari 2600 days.  Getting into the on-line games was a smooth move due to the reasons mentioned above.  I will always have the game age of empires some where in me.  It was that game that introduced me to the on-line community.  Me, being a loner of sorts, this was a great way to solve them anxiety driven social situations.  It was AoE that made me discover clans/guilds.  These clans/guilds was not only a way to have other people to play with, but a way of communicating to others.  I still stay in contact with them, even though we don't play AoE like we used to, but just the fact you have others recognizing you and talking to you, makes you feel good. You don't know how much that makes you feel happy, gives you confidence in yourself, self-esteem is at a high, and you simply don't feel like a outcast.  To me, its not the game itself that keeps me sane and happy, its the people I'm around with that keeps me playing these games.  There was a time when I really didn't know what a &quot;friend&quot; really meant or what constitudes something to be a friend.  The last past 3-4 years, its finally coming to me what a friend is all about.  I don't care if its on-line or real life.  One needs that kind of mentality to get through life.  True, one must keep self-control over this games--as we all know these types of multi-player games can be very addictive and can lead to very awful consequences.  But, if you do have control over your life and feel satisfied with it, then by all means continue to play these types of games.  As for me, I certainly will, maybe not to the extent that once did.  I do have a sense of dissatisfication, having the need of more of a social life now.  Plus I want to really excel in academics.  Its those two reasons, why I won't be on as much as I used to.  The point being,  these types of multi-player games is more then just a &quot;game&quot; its a way to keep you going in life, might not be the healthiest of sorts, but it sure is a way to stay out of trouble and going insane.  To tell you the truth, Everquest and AoE is a main reason I got through the last few years (not in all positive aspects, but still contributed in many ways).  Now, I do have some kind of social life and I'm damn happy about it.  However, these games will always have a home in my heart.  More so the people I've met and become friends with.  I'm not trying to get any sympathy votes or any responses, in fact, this is the first time I'm ever posting a message like this on-line.  I just wanted to say thank you.  May god bless and take care of you all.<br>

Until the 8th grade, I was the smallest kid in school.  And blind as a bat.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Then a growth spurt hit and I discovered power lifting.  I went from 5'6&quot; to 6' and 145lbs to 260lbs.  But I was still blind as a bat and clumsy, too.<br>
<br>
Now, the real point of my story...I went to college as a large, myopic, clumsy D&amp;D playing fiend.  And discovered a group of guys who were as anti-social as I was.  The catch was, they were almost exclusively military and all were bikers.  You have not lived until you have seen two big hairy guys wearing leather, drinking beer out of pitchers in a bar so rough the police wouldn't show up, almost coming to blows over who is tougher - Raistlin or Caramon! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Yes.  Nerds do wear leather!!<br>
<br>
Those guys are still my best friends.  We call each other 'Brother' and we mean it.  So don't sell yourself short, guys.  We are not alone!  And you never know.  That tattooed guy with a beard down to his belt buckle may just be a raging Tolkein fan, too.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But in my time I've had everything from the girl-next-door type to one of my friends I miss the most out in Cali who was 6'5&quot;, 290ish lbs, shaved head and metal spikes on the shoulders of his leather jacket. He was probably the nicest person I've ever met, he wore the getup because it made people leave him alone... for as big as he is, he's never been in a fist fight in his whole life. =) Kind've funny.<br>
<br>
Then there was always the guy who came into the software store I worked in years ago who looked an awful lot like a member of the Gateful Dead who with many snickers asked me if I'd seen the latest issue of High Times magazine and then promptly showed me his Intel R&amp;D ID Badge heheh. It takes all types my friends, and I've met a few of every type that I've called friend. =) <p>Balamur Stoutfaith<BR>

When I graduated High School The Librarian wrote in my year book to the one person That has read more books than any one I have ever Known.  1 to two a day.  My back ground I was a service brat and learned at a very young age how cruel some people can be and am super empatheic and easily hurt if I feel I have caused anyone suffering.  I volenteered to go to Viet Nam both times I went.  I've seen first hand what war is like and detest the thought of not fighting for a rightous cause.  Though I may have been called a baby killer by some I went because I don't like to see any one enslaved by an unjust political system.  Was it a waste of life yes, was it an unjust cause no.  I am now mentaly disabled, have ptsd and survivors guilt.  I am living almost like a king in a third world country because I can ot afford to live in CONUS.  I have somebody with me 24hrs a day, wake up screaming half the time from nightmares and usualy not more than one or two hrs a day.  seldom leave my room.  I get a lot of injections, pills, etc.<br>
     Why am I telling you this?  Because I have been treated more like family in the world in which we play than my own family in the real world.<br>
