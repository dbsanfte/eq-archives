<br>
For those that know me, know that I am a man of few words, until I have been wronged.  Once that Line has been crossed, my temper gets the best of me, heck I’m a barbarian what do you expect. <br>
<br>
But I am a man of honor, so when I make a mistake I take care of it.  So here is another story to add to my catastrophes in Norrath.<br>
<br>
It all began with forming a group in WC to go fight at the hole.  I mean 25% bonus, what can you do.  I get this awesome group:<br>
<br>
51 Druid<br>
50 Shaman<br>
47 Warrior<br>
45 Warrior (me)<br>
44 Chanter<br>
49 Cleric<br>
<br>
We go and breeze through the first hall, and actually take out a 53 rock golem.  After successfully medding to FM, I decide to pull mobs in reverse order.  Meaning, when you do the hole, you fight 3 mobs, 1 mob, 2 mobs, 2 mobs, 1 mob.  So in reverse order we began with the 1 mob and killed it successfully.  I pull the 2 mobs, kill them successfully.  Which leads 6 mobs left.  Well, I pull the 2 mob group, little did I know, the pathing brought the mob towards the start of the hall, pulling all 6.  Well, we kill 4, go OOM and decide to evac.  All is well, so we decide to go to SolB.<br>
<br>
I don’t even know where to start, but do you guys know where the noxious spider spawns?  Well I do, now.  I take my group to where the spiders are, we get ransacked, first by 2, then 4, then 6, then 10, then sonic bats.  Ohhhhh mmmmmyyyyy GOD.  I’m buffed to galore, 3300 HP so I’m taking hits left and right.  Doing the stun dance and trying to get my druid to evac.  <br>
<br>
“OOPS”, he says.  I’m afraid I don’t have it memmed.”<br>
<br>
I type a few words that I am sure looked like a weird combination of letters, and look in amazement as the druid dies, cleric gates, chanter gates (no area mez) shaman runs, warrior runs, and I run.  Guess who the mobs follow, you got it, me.<br>
<br>
I’m running through SolB lost as I have ever been.  Everywhere I go, I end up at a dead end.  I have so many mobs on me, that I have to jump several times to get over.  <br>
<br>
Someone in our group shouts” train”<br>
Where?<br>
Don’t know, but warrior is getting his arse kicked<br>
I’d get out of the lavastorm zone.<br>
We are at the named, safe then.<br>
<br>
At that exact time, I run into the named area.  Along with my “friends”, the sonic bats and spiders and kobolds that I have accumulated.  They decide to give me a little break and wipe 3 peeps in that group.  I am running in blind panic, and run into the window room.  Unfortunate, 2 died in that room.  I finally have my bearings and head to the lavastorm zone, running into several peeps along the way.  I do the jump dance, and finally zone.<br>
<br>
On the other side of the zone, are about 15 very mad peeps, and apparently 4 people with only cloths on.  And they just kept coming, until finally there were 8 of them.  I tell everyone that I will take care of his or her XP rez, and notify a cleric to come to solB for some major rezzing. He shows up, and we start rezzing people in the zone area.  So I ask if anyone needs me to get his or her corpse, and I get a few consents.  Guess what happens next, there are about 3 peeps medding and suffering from rez effect, when I get attack by the first wave of another groups train.  I taunt the mobs off, and have about 6 or 7 bats on me.  <br>
<br>
Group shouts “train”<br>
“Not again”<br>
I calmly shout, “anyone by lavastorm zone,”<br>
“yes, 3 with rez effect”<br>
“ok, I am sorry about this” group shouts<br>
“where r the mobs”<br>
“On me”, I say “Don’t worry, Im not bringing them”<br>
“What r u doing then”<br>
<br>
Loading Plz Wait……<br>
<br>
Total of about 13 deaths so far, and me We shut down the zone, and finally after 30 minutes of rezzing, Everyone seemed very happy, and I was invited to join a group that had 3 peeps wiped out.<br>
<br>
Just goes to say:<br>
<br>
People are Generally understanding.<br>
Most People are Good.<br>
Zowar is the honorable.<br>
Zowar is stupid.<br>
Own your mistakes.<br>
Pay for your Mistakes.<br>
And move on. <br>
<br>
Zowar<br>

Nothing you did in that story sounds anywhere near stupid.  Most folks would not have eaten the death the in that 2nd train in solb either.  There does reach a point in the 'ohh crap where's the zone-mad dash' that it turns into 'oh crap, wheres a good place to die that I can find easy later on'.  <br>
<br>
And druids that don't have evac's memed in a group are not playing a good druid (I've done it once, but had the peace of mind/luck to sit/mem/cast and learned my lesson).  I don't know about chanters not having AE mez mem'd.  It seems like that would be one of the tools of a good crowd control person, but having never played a chanter, I couldn't really weigh in on that issue.<br>
<br>
And I agree that folks are for the most part understanding, even after they have that initial 'WTF?' out of thier system.  And again, I don't see anything in that story that falls under the 'dumb things to do in EQ' list.<br>
<br>
Bravo. <p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~agates42" target="_blank">
