<br>
As I was running from the wonderful train of Drybones, Carrion Ghouls, Festering Hags, and the many Death beetles that our wonderful Ealwen trained the other night in unrest <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , it occured to me that this would be a good place for a guild raid.  Unrest is good for almost anyone above the level 11.  The younger members can hang by the fountain and take out the yard trash that spawns there.  The zone is quite close, so the occasion &quot;RUN!!!..TRAIN&quot; should give them enough warning to head for the zone.  The higher levels 15-20 can head towards the back wall and take on the numerous ghouls and skellies that can be pulled from within the estate while the higher levels can go deeper in and explore the Pit and Magi room.<br>
<br>
In my experience, Unrest has been very good experience, and decent loot for lower levels, bronze weapons, ringmail and jewels droppings are common.  If you can keep away from the train, it migght be pretty fun<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
OH..I think it should be madatory that Ealwen is there standing in the corner,to perform the occasion ressurection that may happen. That way, he can't pull ALL of unrest on the guild and get everybody killed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
At any rate, I think Unrest would be a good place for a guild raid, however, I'd have to warn against anyone going there who is below lv14.  Death beetles are ooh so annoying until about lv22, but I don't think I'd want to wander into Unrest if beetles were still yellow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   A couple of warnings.  Unrest is one of the most trainy zones in all of Norrath, and while the loot can be stupendous, the deaths can be plentiful.  Dolumar, Savarah, Despaire, Nizek, Shawanni and perhaps Deben (Can't remember everyones levels) could go have fun in the tower/bar, A group of high teens could do well on the first floor of the house, and I could hop about the zone helping everyone out.  I can't warn you enough though, if you come to Unrest, expect to die at least once.  If anyone has any questions about Unrest, feel free to ask me in game or out, I'm second to none in knowledge about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I spend more time running around sowing people (&quot;I'm just a girl who can't say no&quot;).<br>
<br>
Seriously, death beetles sound very entertaining, and I've heard of some other great creepy stuff there that'll probably scare me half to death -- hey, why else do I play these games?  Being scared is fun.  One of the best times I ever had was running through the Gorge of King Xorbb alone with no idea which way I should be going!<br>
<br>
If someone could tell me where any traps are, I'd be happier.  Also of course I'd feel better if good old Ealwen came along <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Poor Ealwen, ressing the entire guild!

In fact, in over 1 year of playing EQ, I have never ever even been to Unrest!  However, as I did with Befallen, you can only pick a date and time and see who all can make it.  Do not be upset if you do not get a good turn out, simply pick a different place and time and try planning another raid.  <br>
<br>
I think the initiative to try and organize a raid is wonderful!  I plan to respond similiarly to Cobaaca's suggestion.  I encourage any member of the guild (fledglings included Cobaaca) to be willing to step forward and try to organize raids/groups on the board.  Again, like I said, do not be discouraged if you do not get a good response.  <br>

Soon I shall become level 12(like in ten minutes not including this darn update), I shall also have almost all my level 12 spells, inculding Bind Affiny.  So...I guess I could come and bind people just before the zone if possible (unlike anyone else can't).  I just can't wait to be able to use the spell.<br>
<br>
BTW, the reason I have not too high of level is becuase, just like Gwion I don't spend enough time leveling mainly becuase I love to RP and help my friends out(Plus I started a few other characters which include 3 level 5s).  However, this is going to change.<br>
<br>

<br>
Within the Butcherblock Mountains, there is a 3 way intersection of paths in roughly the middle of the zone.  This is called the crossroads, or xroads by those who frequent the zone.  If you were heading to Greater Faydark from Kaladim (or the docks), you would take a left on the path.  You, however, will want to take a right at this crossing.  This will lead you to Dagnor's cauldron, home to the entrances of 2 of Norrath's least popular dungeons.  From the entrance of Dagnor's cauldron, go down the twisting path until you reach the actual cauldron.  Once the path expands into the actual zone, there are two semi-safe ways of reaching Unrest.  The first, is to hug the right wall until you see the big gaping hole in the side of the stone, which is the entrance to Unrest.  This route can be potentally dangerous because of the extremely steep drops.  If you take your time, It might work out for you, sow is out of the question <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The second way is to go straight forward once the zone expands out, until you hit the water.  Then proceed to hug the shore going right.  Take your time when doing this, there are a huge amount of aqua goblins of levels 15-24 wandering the entire zone.  However, if you see a goblin named Bilge, stop immediately and give Dolumar or I a tell. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (18 wis items tend to get me excited <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  Continue along the shore until you see a large green patch of moss (or I think it's moss... never could tell), soon after that, the shore should be at a near vertical angle.  At that point, you want to leave the shore and head straight south (which will be to your right) and you should see the large opening in the rock, which is Unrest.  I'll escort a couple people there myself if this raid takes place.  <br>
<br>
On getting back...<br>
The best way back is simply to hug the wall on the left after you exit unrest.  That will bring you back to the path which will lead you to Butcherblock.  Or you can follow the shore back, this time taking a left once you hit the water.  (Be careful when heading to the shore though, been hit for 90 odd falling damage in that spot a couple times, seeing that it's nearly vertical)  After heading about 200 feet, you can climb up off the shore, and stay on the ridge until you hit the npc camp.. Once you hit the npc camp, simply go straight ahead towards the large brown splotch of dead grass... moss... or somesuch.  Once upon that hill you'll be able to see the entrance of the path to Butcherblock.  Again, I'll be giving escorts, I realize that this is probably overly confusing.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about Unrest, or the directions, be sure to give me a tell or email me at schuurjg.muohio.edu<br>

An unrest raid sounds like fun. I remember spending a few levels there a couple of years ago with a cleric names Immere and his partner, a halfling cleric named Baerra. (no relation to MY partner Baerra, of course). I found the place alot of fun as a cleric, and am curious how it'll play as a druid. There's good xp and good loot, as long as you have a good team and don't let an idiot pull.(Ah fond memories) Anyhow, I digress. Let us know when and where we're meeting and I'll talk Baerra into it. <br>
<br>
Good hunting and safe journeys all!<br>
