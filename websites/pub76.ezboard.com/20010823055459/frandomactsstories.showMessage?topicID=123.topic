I'd like to shed some light on the subject.<br>
<br>
In defense of my fellow smiths - I snicker when I hear people talking about mastering baking or brewing in an evening for 20-30 PP.  Getting to the level of skill to make FP armor takes well over 1K of platinum for most folks unless they're attempting it at higher levels with good stat-boosting gear, and friends to buff their strength to god-like levels.  It also takes a lot of time - we're talking a played day or more.  That's just to get to the level where it is viable (175), and you still have a good chance at failing on the 3-sheet items.<br>
<br>
Oh, can't forget the cost of leather padding... I pay aspiring tailors 80-100 PP per stack of padding, and each armor combine requires one padding.  Or I can blow more playing time camping spiderlings, wolves &amp; such and make'em myself... you get the idea.<br>
<br>
With the cost per attempt at making each piece of FP armor being about 30-100 PP... the smith who is charging you 75-100 PP per sheet to make the item is accounting for the chance of failure, especially on the 3-sheet items.  (Heck, folded MQ sheets trivial well below 176, and I still fail on that occasionally - 23 PP down the oubilette there!)  He/she WILL go broke if trying to do it consistently for 10 PP per AC, which some smiths who seem to be poor at math are charging.<br>
<br>
There is also a time investment - molds and metal are available in a limited number of places.  For example, your options for small plate molds are Neriak and Kaladim - with MQ metal avaialble in Steamfont or Highkeep - you get the idea.<br>
<br>
Look at it this way - you can pay the smith his price, or spend the same amount of money and throw away all your EQ time for a week or so skilling up, which is what WE have done.  You're trading plat for time, friend.  <br>
<br>
Or - YOU go get all the materials and bring them to the smith, and accept the cost of failures yourself.  Any smith at this level will likely say &quot;Sure!&quot; if you make this offer, you're effectively subsidizing a run of skill attempts for him/her.<br>
<br>
Don't even get me started on dyes - I made a brief stab at collecting them myself, gave up and started buying it.  Have to hunt SOMETIME, hehe. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (Oh, Shalindar, I stil owe your for those components!  D'oh!  Saturday, dear.)<br>
<br>
IMNSHO, the only people who have it tougher than smiths in this regard are jewellers, and to some extent tailors.  Jewelcraft is EXPENSIVE, even by the standards of smithing, and the time investment seems to be at least the same if not greater.  Tailoring requires the camping of critters for components, which is a HUGE time sink, and until the discovery of the Wu's Fighting Armor recipies recently the path to skilling up to the Velious tailoring seemed bleak indeed.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rant - don't get me wrong, I LOVE being able to make this stuff.  I'm assuming the person complaining about the cost of smithed gear was unaware of the reasons behind the pricing, so my goal was to educate. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hope this has shed some light on the subject.<br>

<br>
Well, to take it from a tailoring side, I would have to say that smithing does have a couple of advantages over tailoring.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Mind you, this isn't to say that Amergen is wrong, just that smithing as a skill does have some serious bonuses over tailoring... from this players sewing experience.<br>
<br>
1) You can BUY pretty much all your raw materials (molds, metals, etc.)  Tailors can make money from the get go (costs 5 gold for a pattern, but can sell the finished patchwork-leather item back for 6 gold); but have to go hunting for silks, pelts, threads, etc... not to even mention trying to get a smith to make you a stack of metal studs, or a brewer to make some heady kiola to you.  So, technically, if you want to be a &quot;solo tailor&quot; you'll need to have smithing in the 40s or so (for the metal studs), and brewing of about 70 (for the Kiola)... but then you need the viscus mana, and this isn't even thinking about reinforced leather either.<br>
<br>
You want to know why my tailoring is only a 60?  I haven't been able to brew any heady kiola for myself, and, few offer it in an auction.  I've done my best to make shaman bags, but grizzly skins are a bear to find, and you need at least six spiderling skils to make the silk cord for the shaman bag.  Talk about a big-pain-in the behind!<br>
<br>
2) Few to none ask for leather armor; you do get some tells for raw silk, and the rare requrest for studded leather; however, for a long time, you're only recourse is to take your finished product, and sell it back to the merchant.  You only start being able to sell to others when you start to be able to make cured silk and tailored quivers/backpacks (which start in the upper fifties range.)  So, most &quot;tailors&quot; pewter out in the teens... if that.  Most smiths pewter out in the 80s or so (when they can sell/make banded.)<br>
<br>
So... when new tailors see all the requests for &quot;banded this&quot; and &quot;banded that&quot; it does get a bit depressing and your leather doesn't do much, except go back to the merchant.<br>
<br>
3) Time... I'd still have to give to smiths.  Ever try to camp crag spiders for silk swatches?  Or spiderlings for silk threads?  It's soooooooo time consuming.  Well... then again, you all have to run around a lot so... maybe we're even.  But then again, we have to brew for Heady Kiola, and smith for metal studs... so... maybe tailors have it a bit worse.<br>
<br>
4) Money.  What with all the new velious stuff, the price of silk swatches and threads is ridiculus now.  Especially if you don't have Mr. Uber Level to give your aspiring tailor a healthy hunk of change.  Honestly, I cannot afford to give the 30 - 50 plat for a stack of swatches, and the 20 plat for a stack of threads... which leaves me to either hunting them myself... or to despirately try to buy them off merchants, or players who don't ask absorbant prices for them.<br>
<br>
Just some quick thoughts from a tailor who so wants to start making some real stuff... just need to go hunting the raw components.<br>

SO I began to kill spiders and stuff mastered raw silk, then I founf out that my next step to overcome was reinforced leather.  Sure, I cna do that.  What do I need?  Little bone things?  Sure....got those (after a while).  WHAT?  Medium Quality pelts???  In my whole 14 levels I have seen maybe 5 of these.  At the most!  I gave up immediately.  I dont need to make money THAT bad.  <br>
<br>
SO now after creating a ranger and absolutely loving him to death, I have begun to start fletching.  Boy is this easy!  already at 56 after having only spent about 10-15pp.  awesome.  I'm happy.  I;ve done my research and it seems that everything you need to fletch can be bought at vendors, making the problem just patience and cash to bu the materials.  Albiet I will have a much smaller market to sell to, it's not just about making money.<br>
<br>
People in EQ can't get satisfaction with just having the bigger weapon, hottest nuke, fastest backstab, strongest arm....  The satisfaction gained by knowing that you can create magically wonderful itmes that people all over Norrath are wanting with just plain ole materials that can be found anywhere is unparallel.  And a big round of applause is due to those that have spent the time and the money in mastering these skills so everyone else doesn't ahveto worry about it.  Because of are master skills people, the rest of us can continue playing EQ knowing there are others willing to ..<br>
to... umm.  Darnitbuggerdamit.  Lost my train of thought.  Oh well.  You catch my drift. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
