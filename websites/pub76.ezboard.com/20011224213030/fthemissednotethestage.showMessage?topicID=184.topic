I decided to take a short cut from the docks to the bank that would pass near the Theater of the Tranquil, where, as a child, I saw my first bard and became enthralled with the performing arts. When I rounded the corner, I noticed a small crowd gathered in front of the stage. Slowly I approached and watched a wizened old Erudite woman who seemed to be making some sort of announcement from the stage. I missed what she said, but stayed to listen as a young adventurer took the stage.<br>
<br>
He told a tale of high adventure, but it was poorly told, clearly the work of a warrior or perhaps a ranger, crass and unrefined. When he was finished, the Erudite woman ushered him off the stage. Then another took the stage and told a similar tale. And then another, and then another. All the tales followed the same plot: I found a monster, I killed it, I looted it. Sometimes alone, sometimes in a group, but always the same. And they all were impressive only to the teller. <br>
<br>
The old lady shook her head and asked "Are there no true Loreseekers amongst you? Has no one a tale as yet unheard?"<br>
<br>
Quietly, I raised my hand and said "If you are interested in lore, I could tell the story of the Mad Prophet."<br>
<br>
"Oh? I've not heard that story. Please come to the stage and share it with us."<br>
<br>
I pulled my trusty lute from my pack as I climbed the stairs to the stage. Then, with a soft musical accompaniment, I began constructing a wondrous tale.<br>
<br>
"In a time not long ago, a human was born in this very town. But he was no ordinary man, no, he was touched by the Dragon God. Or so he thought. He grew up and learned the art of the magician, but forever his heart was empty. For a long time, thoughts of the Dragon God swirled through his head, until one day he convinced himself that he was the True Prophet of the Dragon God. He was a likeable fellow and was always welcomed in taverns. But soon after arriving in a room, he would begin telling anyone who would listen about the Dragon God. Some folks would leave, others would ignore him, and yet others would laugh when he wasn't paying attention, but still he persisted. I was fortunate enough to meet this fellow and I had many discussions with him regarding his Dragon God. Being a devout convert to Veeshanism, I thought we were kin in our beliefs, but soon I came to realize that his Dragon God was in fact not Veeshan herself. No, his Dragon God was claimed to be much older and more powerful than Veeshan, which I of course knew to be false. Praise Veeshan!<br>
<br>
I tried to reason with him, then to argue with him, but I could never get him to see the errors in his ways. Who knows, perhaps there is a Dragon God out there and the Prophet isn't mad after all. But even if the Dragon God is a figment of his tormented imagination, perhaps it could one day be real. The last I heard of the Prophet, he was traveling the lands seeking converts to Dragonism and had even made a pilgrimage to Cabalis, home of the Iksar in an attempt to find proof of his God and fellow believers. Perhaps if enough people believe, then the Dragon God will become real. In the mean time, if you happen across a Dragonist, or are lucky enough to meet the Prophet, buy them a beer and listen to their tale."<br>
<br>
With that I stopped strumming the lute, stood, and took a bow. The gathered crowd applauded the performance of a true bard and yelled for more tales. I turned to see the old Erudite lady clapping her hands and smiling. <br>
<br>
She took my hands in hers and said "Thank you sir! It has been so long since I have heard a new tale! Now I can add that to the Library in Erudin and preserve it for all time. You are indeed a true Loreseeker! Please travel the lands and gather more stories. Bring them to me in Erudin that I might scribe them for all to read."<br>
<br>
I bowed and kissed her lightly on the hand. "My lady, I would be honored to brave any danger in order to bring you tales from around the world."<br>
<br>
She blushed and smiled at me, then said, "In that case, I will give you a staff to protect you and help you in your quest for Lore."<br>
<br>
She reached into a large pack that lay on the stage and brought forth a fantastic staff. It was curled at the bottom and was capped with two golden wings that sprang forth from a flawless emerald. She handed me the staff and bowed. "The staff is not for fighting, but it will keep you from harm."<br>
<br>
I bowed back and took the staff. I was awestruck, never had I received such a fine gift! "I will carry it with pride my lady, and I will think of you as I search for lore, both forgotten and newly formed."<br>
<br>
The crowd's cheers swelled as I raised the staff for all to see. But in the confusion, the Erudite librarian disappeared, as if a ghost, into the night.<br>

I hate to break it too you though, it was an April Fools joke. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I had some wierd graphics glitch that made my smoldering brand look like this (and my friends gave me a hard time about my flower thingy). So I got a screenshot to post for everyone's enjoyment. Then I got creative and decided to write a little story to go along with it. Then I realized April Fool's Day was near. Then I remembered the uber item maker over at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://beta.evercrest.com/">beta.evercrest.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and well, the rest is, as they say, history. <br>
<br>
I'm glad everyone enjoyed the story, but I'm surprised no one figured out it was a fake. I thought for sure someone would spot it instantly. But no one did, so I'll have to come up with another way to give out the prize.<br>
<br>
So here is the contest, and the winner gets a Harpoon of the Depths:<br>
<br>
Come up with a funny item description (use the uber item maker and post it if possible) for the staff. I'll read em all and pick the one I like the best. That person gets the prize. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
