<br>
He slowly climbed the tower jutting from a small island in Lake Rathe.  Speed was not possible, considering the weight on his heart, and the wine flowing in his veins.  That did not dull the pain, however, nor the sharp memories.<br>
<br>
Well he remembered meeting her, a mere young nymph and slip of an elf, alone in Kelethin.  Smitten is not a strong enough word.<br>
<br>
Being both warriors in the way of the elves, he took her along and trained her.  For 19 long, arduous campaigns he held her, through evil times and good, until she could take her place alongside him as an equal.  How well he fondly remembered the first stout blade he had given her...  And the second, more powerful, as her prowess increased, and all the other gear of war that are the tools of their deadly trade.  The lessons of navigation through the lands of Norrath, the instruction on dealing with those of lesser character...  How it all flooded back to him in one massive wave of grief.<br>
<br>
What had happened?<br>
<br>
He searched his memories, recognizing his failings, for none can be said to be perfect.  How his heart was rent at the realization of how fragile their love was, and how hard he worked to ensure his heart was as pure as his intentions toward her.  Verily, he had erred, but never with thought for himself, never with intention to hold her or do anything against her will and desires.  His mistakes had been that – mistakes - As had hers, on the training fields, the battlefields, and when alone, together, away from prying eyes.  A mere elf was he, as flawed and imperfect as any, yet as true and caring as few could be.  Many times she had forgiven him, and he had as well in return.  Nether were worthy of judging any other, for the wise even are blinded at times.<br>
<br>
He fingered the engagement ring that he wore, made by her own hand, and the tide of emotion flooded him again.  Slowly he peered over the edge of the tower, then all at once, with a rage at a world gone wrong, flung himself into the water that was the icy, prickly death of many.  And with the same cold rush that grappled with his mortal flesh, the cold rush of waking from a nightmare came to him:  This could not be.  He was a warrior at heart, and had fought far too long and arduous to relent now.  She was not here.  She was not coming to the appointed place to exchange their vows.  But worse tasks have been set to others to overcome than this.  They were by far stronger than this.<br>
<br>
He dragged himself up on the rocks, coughing a seeming endless supply of frigid water from his innards, struggling to maintain his wits in spite of the wine, the grief, the cold, the pain.  He reached over to the sword that lay to his side, flung away in contempt at receiving the news that she would not come, and used it as a crutch.  How fitting that it should be underhand when he emerged from his near death’s dive.  He snickered at the not-quite vulgarity of the scene, or maybe it was just more water coming up.  That did not matter now.  Only one thing did.  The struggle.<br>
<br>
The engagement ring stayed on his finger, and does to this day.  As do the flowers that she playfully entwined in his long hair.  The wedding rings that were to replace the first rings came tumbling out of the pouch that he had secreted them in.  As the realization struck him that all is not perfect, that all may not be as one wishes, that all one can do is pray and strive, he flung one of the rings into the lake.  “Take one for that which may not be!” he shouted into the storm, “But I keep one for that which may yet be again!”<br>
<br>
He stole away and hid the other wedding ring in a deep place, barely able to walk yet driven to no end of resolve now.  It was far too painful to look upon such a fair reminder, yet burned in his mind as a focus for his desire.  One day yet, he thought, she may return to this place.  And if she does, they will together discover this precious token of love again.<br>
