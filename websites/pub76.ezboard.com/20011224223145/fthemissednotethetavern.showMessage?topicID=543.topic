Something was obviously going on, as there were very few guards out and about in Nektulos. There were so few in fact, he had encountered more than a few of the Halfling troops that were fighting to reclaim the forest. The small folk rarely came beyond their temples, camps, and small huts. That they were out on the main path--and openly killing guards--indicated something was amiss. <br>
<br>
Iommi pulled shadows around himself to stay well hidden--now was not a time he wanted to have to deal with the small halflings. On his way back from Velious, he had heard rumors of grim experiments occuring within Neriak. Supposedly deformed creatures of all kinds had appeared in the Commonlands and the Desert of Ro, terrorizing travellers. He had heard reports of Sand Giants and Griffins, with their skin rotting away and eyes glowing eerily green, holding the usually heavily travelled areas in the grip of terror. Undead, similarly rotting desert scarabs and tarantulas the size of giants were everywhere. He had had to bribe the captain of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Icebreaker</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with almost every platinum he had to get the gnome to take him to North Ro. Apparently some of the griffins had flown into the Iceclad Ocean, and some of the Giants had crossed over the water to destroy the gnomish outposts.<br>
<br>
All of these monsters had reportedly come down out of Nektulos forest.<br>
<br>
Regardless of where they came from, travel and trade across the Commonlands had come to a standstill. Unlike Innoruuk's minions in the dreaded Kithicor Forest, these undead monstrosities didn't mind the light. They were out and about twenty four hours a day. Save the bravest of travellers (Iommi had encountered only two fellow travellers on his way from the docks in Northern Ro all the way to Nektulos), all land from the southern reaches of the Desert of Ro, all the way up through the Commonlands and Kithicor Forest, had been deserted. Freeport was in danger of overflowing with refugees. Some of the more religious travellers had thought this an omen from an angry Solusek Ro. According to them, the firey god was angered that his temple was so rarely visited these days, and he was exacting his revenge. Iommi, of course, knew better.<br>
<br>
There had also been reports of plague instances in Freeport. Apparently Bertoxxulous knew when to take advantage of a situation.<br>
<br>
Iommi knew this was all related to the experiments he had heard of occuring in Neriak. They were tampering with the world of the dead. It had gone beyond simple Necromancy: they were trying to bridge the two worlds and bring them together. The Queen of the Necromancers had given her life to initiate the massive spell that needed to be performed in order to tear the fabric between the worlds, but without her guidance, the fools were as the blind stumbling around in the dark. Iommi knew of the spell needed to create the bridge. Indeed, he could perform it. He also knew how to counter it, and that was what he had come for.<br>

I almost had to fight me way here!&quot; He looked around. &quot;Barkeep! Grab me ah nice ale if you will, any kind'll do!&quot;<br>
<br>
The man was Gunnaer Warhammer, a Shaman from the Northlands and merchant. He had basically retired from the Shamanic trade years ago, and spent his days selling off rare treasures he came across when exploring in abandoned ruins and mountains. When trade and travel across the Commonlands ceased three weeks ago, he was devastated: it was the best place to sell his wares. <br>
<br>
A few nights ago, the monsters had simply disappeared.<br>
<br>
He had been discussing this turn of events with a very odd Dark Elf the night before. The Elf seemed interested in any reports of monsters that could be found, whether they were in the Commonlands, or half a world away. He had kept muttering something about those &quot;God damned fools in the court.&quot; When Gunnaer asked what he meant, the other had only replied &quot;Nothing, nothing...&quot; The man had set Gunnaer's mind going, and he was ready to head north to Nektulos to check out the scene there. As a trader, he was on friendly terms with most races, save the Iksar, Heretics of Paineel, and Trolls. The Tier'dal tolerated his presence as long as he brought interesting wares. He had something that he was sure would perk their interest.<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
Iommi snapped awake to see the shape standing in front of him. &quot;Magus?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silent Iommi. Remember, you may be banned from ever coming to Trium again, but you are my eyes and ears here. The Dragons are unusually active, I need you to find out what the hell is going on. Trium is still being torn apart by a thousand tiny wars, yet no one sees the large one on the horizon. You need to keep track of what goes on here, so I don't have to worry about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Iommi sighed and nodded. &quot;Magus...&quot;<br>
<br>
The elder mage didn't let him speak anymore. The tall man turned, walked away, and faded into nothing. <p><center><BR>

Her personal advisor, and the leaders of the various Tier'dal guilds, families, and factions, stood in her conference chambers. They were discussing the recent, rather major betrayal by a certain Tier'dal going by the name of Iommi Gehennabringer.<br>
<br>
Gehennabringer was a mysterious man, always had been, and prided himself in that fact. There were rumors he was a direct descendant of Mistmoore, or of Dragons, or even someone from a different <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> planet</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Perhaps none of them were true, perhaps all of them. It didn't matter: he was a traitor to the Dead and the Crown, and Queen Christanos Thex wanted him dead.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hear...that Gehennabringer eluded your best men a few months ago, that he escaped from the under-city prisons. You ought to be ashamed. Letting this man escape from right under your noses <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> twice</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ancient, shrouded, skeletal figure of the Queen of the Dead wished to speak. In the rare instances she spoke, she made it known telepathically. She was in failing health, reportedly from experimenting on herself, and almost constantly being in the form of a lich or some other undead creature. Rumors were that she supported herself by taking living sacrifices. Rumors were probably true, in this case. She barely had the strength to speak, much less raise her hand or move forward. Her voice was thin and raspy. She was constantly under a black veil, barely visible, but her bone-thin limbs and body were all too apparent. No one dared think of her dying for good and letting someone ascend the throne, the last person who had, was never seen again after that meeting.<br>
<br>
The Queen of the Dead had also ascended to the throne herself after Iommi's mother had been assassinated. She was Lynaela Gehennabringer's successor...and predecessor. She was the first Queen of the Dead. Others had come and gone, but she had led in between each one. She vowed Lynaela would be the last woman to be Queen of the Dead besides her, until she died.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gehennabringer comes from a long line of powerful beings,&quot; the voice hissed. &quot;His foster father was the leader of the Warpriests. How did he die? Iommi poisoned the food his mother sent with him when he went off on the great war with the Knights of Truth. His foster mother was one of mine. How did she die? Stabbed in the back by her own adopted son. And if he truly is descended from that bastard Mistmoore...he is one to be feared. Who knows what spies he could have among us? He was our most adept, our darkest, our most powerful. He could have undead all over the city, watching, waiting. The way to end the matter is simple...we find him...and we destroy him. Forever.&quot; <p><center>

The way home from Kunark was a slow one.  Hardly a breeze would guide his small boat and he had been feasting on fish for days.  His water had run out just as land presented itself before him but getting there was taking longer than expected.  Finally fed up with the speed at which he travelled the fully armored shadow knight threw himself into the water and began his impossibly difficult swim to shore.  His mouth was dryer than the desert and he had to resist swallowing the salted water that frollocked about him.  <br>
<br>
With much effort and will the half drowned dark elf dragged his body onto the sanded shore and lay there for several minutes panting as if he were a dog.  He rolled onto his back, looked to the sky and sighed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Antonica, how I missed your lands...&quot; he muttered between breaths.  <br>
<br>
Lifting himself slowly he started his long travel to his homeland to which he hadn't visited in months upon months.  New scars, memories of old friends dead, new skills and old pains rippled throughout Malignus' body.  Nothing seemed familiar here.  The desert was unusually lonely and the sands didn't whip around like shards of glass.  Clearing the last dune and entering into the cave leading to the commons he noticed a strange absence in....a presence.  Almost not a single traveller could be seen galloping through one of the liveliest trading spots in all of Norrath, atleast that's how it was before he had left.  <br>
<br>
&quot;These new lands bring abandon to our ancient ones.&quot; Malignus whispered under his breath.  Clearing the entrance of the cave and galloping onto fresh grass and trees he made a sprint to the edge of the mountains and into Nektulos.  It didn't take long before a rumbling began to follow him.  Quickening his pace he ignored all that was around him until the rumbling slowly faded like the wind and he was once again in friendly grounds.  The dark abandon of Nektulos forest.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showMessage?topicID=347.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showMessage?topicID=553.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=543.topic&index=3><img src=http://turkkurt.homestead.com/files/z/Sasi/brmreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.threadControl?topicID=543.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=543.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=543.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themissednotethetavern">The Tavern<option value="themissednotethestage">The Stage<option value="themissednotetidbits">Tidbits<option value="themissednotetantrums">Tantrums  <option value="themissednotefrm11">Just for fun!<option value="themissednoteguildlinks">Links<option value="themissednotethepartyforum">The Party Forum<option value="themissednotetradesevents">Trades & Events<option value="themissednotetesting">Testing<option value="themissednotefrm12">Ghost thread</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
