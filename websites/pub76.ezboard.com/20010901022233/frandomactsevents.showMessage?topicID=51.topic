  Hi all.  I'd like to make a proposal for this weekend...an impromptu Guild First-Aid in Greater Fay.  Gfay was the most fun of our First-Aids, in my opinion.  There are also more young ones in that zone than any other low level zones.  It seems to me we haven't had a &quot;helping others&quot; event in quite awhile.  Raids are much fun, and great for the Guild, but we can't forget what we're founded upon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
  I'd like suggestions for a time that the most people would be able to attend..perhaps mid-late morning on Saturday(EST)?  I don't want to interfere with the Guild raid on Crushbone, (which I'll also hopefully be attending, raid time permitting)  So, unless anyone has problems with the time, say 11 a.m. Sat morning (EST), that'll be the tentative time for now.  If the majority of people are happy with this, we'll go with it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  Also, I read about a bug that enables a druid, shaman, or enchanter(possibly necro) to be able to have the Guards at the POD lift attack and kill the Priest of Discord.  Quite an exciting battle it is.  Me and Shawanni had him killed twice at first, then I came back later with Baerra and Ammere to show them.  I started talking in /ooc in length to the whole zone while I was with Baerra and Ammere about a trial against the POD, followed by a verdict of execution.  There was quite a crowd to watch the &quot;execution&quot; of the Priest.  I received many tells about how fun the trial roleplaying was, and thought we could possibly do something along these lines during the First Aid, perhaps to open it up?  Something along the lines as we all arrive(as a Guild, in /ooc), proclaim Random Acts is here to pass judgement on the POD, continue RP'ing it out, then conclude by having the Guards slay him.  We could then commence the First Aid camp.  I don't want to post here how it's done, because it would cheapen the experience for those that don't know.  If you /tell me about it game though, I'd be happy to inform you how it's done.<br>
<br>
  Not long till Saturday..., so let the posts begin  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Great Idea, I meant to post a note here when you<br>
first posted it but something important at home<br>
took me away (a family member had to go to<br>
the emergency room).<br>
<br>
When you say &quot;impromptu&quot;, do you mean that<br>
we shouldn't announce this event to the public<br>
beforehand?<br>
<br>
I love First Aid Camps. We haven't had one this<br>
month yet because we were using August to<br>
get to know our guildmates better. Also, First<br>
Aid Camps always bring a flood of requests for<br>
new memberships, and we were trying to<br>
get to know our Fledglings first.<br>
<br>
I look forward to this one and if you have no<br>
objections, I will post some announcements<br>
about it on various public webpages.<br>
<br>
Note: I also have an idea for another<br>
new kind of event: Anonymous Angelic Assistance (AAA).<br>
Some of us would pick an area and start<br>
assisting others, but we would first go on<br>
anonymous so our guildtags don't show. That<br>
way the people wouldn't know who helped them<br>
and we wouldn't get any credit for it. This is <br>
something we could do at any time and I<br>
am going to start doing this when I am in<br>
between other things. Let me know what you<br>
think about this idea. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This is &quot;soon-to-be&quot; fledgeling Tevael here *g*<br>
<br>
I think it's a great idea to have this First-Aid camp, actually through those events I heard of this guild for the first time. And now I will soon be able to attend to such an event as a fledgeling member of Random Acts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So you can count me in for that, wouldn't want to miss it. <br>
<br>
And I also think no one should miss the PoD getting judged by the guards another time (saw that the first time when Dolumar, Baerra and Ammere were in Gr Fay yesterday, hehe, that was fun). I would really like to know how this works...and is it possible in other towns as well ?? I guess the PoD's are always hanging around guarded areas, so how about the one in my home Felwithe ?? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

A First Aid Camp in GFay, especially by the orc lift, would be greatly welcomed, I'll wager.  There's usually a trail of bodies from the orc lift to orc hill.  We might even put a satellite location on orc hill, or even as far as the zone to CB.  (to pick up train wreck survivors, LOL)<br>

I was gonna try to catch the tail-end of the CB raid, have a good sleep, and then get up in time for our long-overdue FA camp.  Unfortunately, when I came in to my RL workplace on Friday, I was asked to work extra hours to cover for someone that wouldn't be working on the next shift.  I figured, &quot;Ok, I'll miss the raid but I can still attend the camp in the morning&quot;.  After a very long day, I finally got home and Tchallar awoke to get his butt over to Greater Fay all the way from the Qeynos area.  Luckily Dolumar was roaming the lands at the same time and sped up the trip considerately once he discovered my intentions (once more Dolumar, I thank thee!). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So, I made it there in record time, still having about 6 hours to go at the time, I believe.  I hung around for a little while, doing some preliminary first aid.  I even saved a few lives when I wasn't distracted.  Then I decided I should take a nap so I wouldn't be too zombied out to be any real help for later.  What a mistaka to maka!!  I woke up several hours after the camp had started!  Well, that's pretty much the reason why I was a no-show.  Just thought I should explain what happened to me since I'm sure I was expected to be there by some folks.  I was all psyched for this weekend, too.  Now I've gotta figure out what I'm gonna do out here in Faerie-ville. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway, that's my story.
