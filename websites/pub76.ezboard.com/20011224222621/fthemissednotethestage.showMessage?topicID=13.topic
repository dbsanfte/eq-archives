Pt.6</span><hr size=1>  <BR> The sun had set.  She could hear crowds of people outside, the laughter and shouts of the festival.  She rose, her buttocks sore from the wood floor but she no longer shook and the flames had long since died. <BR> She tried to find meaning to the dream.  &quot;I died, or should have died.&quot;  She could find no reason, no purpose behind the vision.  As intense as it had been it revealed nothing. <BR>  <BR> After dressing she shook the cloak out and threw it across her shoulders, green on the outside this time, and drew the hood over her head.  Remembering the dagger, she strapped it to her waist below the cloak and left her room. <BR> Coming down the stairs she heard the crowd, it was as Denan said, the tavern was full.  Shouts and laughter created a din that made talking difficult and listening impossible yet they carried on, each drowning the tedium of their day in ale and conversation.  Two serving girls and a boy moved about the room, trays loaded with food, drinks and empty dishes.  She saw an older human woman come from the kitchen to load the boy's tray with a meal before shooing him off. <BR>  <BR> Denan scurried rapidly from one end of the bar to the other, pouring drinks, collecting coin and chatting heartily with everyone at once.  Catching her eye he waved her down to where he stood. <BR> &quot;Goin out now missy?&quot; he asked rhetorically.  &quot;Be safe and keep one eye and both hands on your money pouch, the cuttpurses'll be out in force by now.&quot; <BR> She smiled and nodded grasping his hand briefly. <BR> &quot;If you come back around ninth band or so, you'll catch a minstrel that'll rock your boat I'd wager.  Kind on the ears and eyes if the stares my servers give him are any tellin.&quot;  He grinned mischievously as she blushed. <BR> &quot;I'll try Denan.  I'm going out for a bit to stretch my legs and take in the sights.&quot; <BR> He nodded, &quot;Aye, good luck then.  I'll see you in a while.&quot;  She smiled and waved as she pushed her way through the crowd and into the streets. <BR>  <BR> The streets, while less crowded than the Bald Griffin, were no less active.  Merchant wagons lined the plaza, while the interior was taken up with entertainers of every sort imaginable.  Jugglers, mimes, animal trainers, actors and puppeteers fought for space and coin as they showed off their skills to the admiring crowd. <BR> She drifted through like everyone else, watching the shows and going whichever way the flow carried her.  Two clowns shouting exaggerated challenges before beating each other with padded maces finally brought a grin to her face and her spirits began to lift.  Passing a fruit stand she was startled by two jugglers tossing flaming torches between them.  Stunned for a moment, she backed into an elderly man who cursed her clumsiness before being carried away in the flow of people. <BR>  <BR> Coming upon a wide circle of people she stopped.  In the center stood a man and a black bear, the beast's forepaws on his shoulders as they danced about the ring.  The crowd stilled and gasped in amazement as the beastmaster pulled the muzzle off the bear only to have his entire face bathed in bear tongue.  She grinned at the creature's antics then brought one hand to her head as her vision swam. <BR> Two images fought for dominance, both of the bear and his trainer, one her own yet the other from eyes much closer to the ground.  As she fought to straighten out her double vision, words came unbidden to her lips. <BR> &quot;Mommy, Daddy, look at the bear.  Look at the bear!&quot;  The words echoed in her ears as she spoke them.  She turned, her rebellious vision her own again as she looked for the one whose voice also spoke the words. <BR>  <BR> A child.  A little human girl no older than ten seasons jumped up and down in excitement sending strands of long, chestnut hair flying about her shoulders.  She was anxiously pulling on her mom's hand and pointing at the bear.  Behind them both stood a tall man, his hand on the woman's shoulder absently playing with a lock of her red hair as he grinned proudly at the girl.  The nameless woman could only stare and could not break away even as the man's eyes rose to meet hers. <BR> A bolt shot through her soul.  The world around them slowed to a stop in that brief meeting of the eyes.  Frustration and helplessness washed over her as she knew, she KNEW!  This was a man familiar to her, indeed that her life was tied inseparably to.  Yet no name, no place, no event rose from the black pool of her mind.  Even as she fought through the murky depths of her memories she saw something else entirely in his eyes.  Recognition, guilt, and fear.  All of these emotions raced across his face to be followed up finally with sadness. <BR>  <BR> As suddenly as it happened, their souls parted, the world crashed in on her and the man disappeared into the crowd as his oblivious wife and child dragged him off.  She stood there, staring at the place in the multitude where the family had disappeared.  Her feet were unwilling to move as again she found herself fighting for breath. <BR> Only seconds passed before, again, she saw a face and felt unfulfilled recognition.  This one though struck fear in her heart.  Their eyes never met yet she felt a different sort of connection.  Wearing nondescript clothes covered in a lightweight tan cloak and hood he moved easily through the crowd toward some unknown goal.  His eyes shifted about as his feet carried him onward.  He too became one with the mass of people before it came to her.  He was stalking the family, stalking the man.  Terror gripped her heart as she tried to follow his path to no avail. <BR> Again she knew.  That one was a killer.  His target was the tall man whose soul she had joined with so briefly.  And again there was no reason for her knowledge.  Nothing to explain how she knew the father or the one who tracked him.  She walked in the general direction the family had gone, hoping to catch a glimpse of them again. <BR>  <BR> Two full bands she searched without success.   Too many people, too large a city.  Tired, frustrated and scared she reluctantly accepted failure and started back to the Bald Griffin. <BR> It was tenth band by the time she made it back to Denan's inn.  She could only give him a tired smile as she climbed the stairs to her room.  Exhaustion overtook her as she collapsed, still in cloak and dress, on her bed and fell into a deep but restless sleep. <BR>  <BR> She heard a noise.  Not outside she was sure.  Not the cats or the dogs digging through the garbage piled in the alley but a bump from another room.  Swinging her legs down from the bed she dropped to the floor.  Carefully she tucked the necklace and pendant Daddy had given her back in her nightdress and padded in bare feet to her parent's room. <BR> Peering in she saw only her mother's shape in the bed.  Turning, she headed past her room towards the sitting room.  Hearing a voice not her father's she stopped short of the entrance and peeked one eye around the corner. <BR> She saw her father kneeling, arms wrapped around himself as he stared at the floor.  Over him, a dark figure whispered something, something that scared her.  Her father replied in a harsh, pained voice, &quot;Finish it assassin, but know this.  Your master will not win.  Things greater than he are in motion, events he cannot stop.&quot; <BR> The assassin only hissed as his blade whipped silently across his victim's throat.  The girl watched as her father fell with a muffled thump to the floor.  Her child's mind not yet fully comprehending the tragedy just befallen.  She looked up at the assassin just as he noticed her.  Pausing only for a moment, the little girl's life hanging in the balance, he waited for the blink of her eyes, then faded into the shadows.  Staring into nothing, her eyes slowly fell to the floor where the dark form that was her father lay.  She didn't notice the warmth slowly pooling about her feet. <BR> &quot;Daddy?&quot; <BR> &quot;Daddy?&quot; <BR>  <BR> Across the city, in an inn called the Bald Griffin, another figure tossed in her sleep and cried out softly. <BR>  <p>Dorraxx Firehelm<BR>
