Spring came to her senses, partly , to discover herself wandering high in the snowy hills. Her sword was strapped across her chest still, but she’d lost her pack and a boot somewhere. The moonlight reflected from the snow gave enough illumination that she could see the bare foot was mottled blue. Spring looked at it distractedly, as though it were some picture in a book.  Somehow she knew it must hurt, just as she knew her leathers were soaked through from tumbling in the snow as she climbed. She knew her hair hung in long icy mats about her head. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But the pain in her center pushed outward and left no room, no room for other pain.  She was near to the tallest of all the peaks, and kept climbing, on hands and knees. She left a bloody trail, her hands cut from the sharp ice and rock.  As she went, she chanted over and over “He can’t be dead, he can’t be dead, he can’t be dead, he can’t be dead....”  A word with each move forward, she crawled upward, exhausted. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Though her mouth said the words, she knew Breon was dead. Freya had nothing to gain from lying to her. Her own mother had killed Breon. Spring retched into the snow.  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Freya!” Spring screamed into the night air. I will not call that creature mother, she thought. “Freya,” she yelled. There was no answer but her own voice echoing off the silent hills. She waited, the echo faded to silence. There was no answer. A wolf howled, not far away. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crying, Spring  found the dagger she kept in the remaining boot. Numbed, delirious, she grasped the dagger in her right hand and cut open her left cheek. “I will not be your beautiful daughter,” she panted, staring up at the stars.  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She fell then, onto the rocks and snow. She tried to move, but could not. Spring heard the wolf howl again, much closer this time. She wondered, without any real concern, if she would be unconscious or dead before the wolves found her. Blood stained the snow beneath her cheek.  She felt empty, free, waiting for whichever death might claim her.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ********************************************************************<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wolf had first scented the distraught human when she went to the glen. She always drank at the spring when she woke, and was surprised to scent a human had been there, and so upset. That glen usually calmed all creatures who came there, even wandering goblins.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wolf stretched then followed the scent for some time. Instead of going on the path back to the town, this human had started to wander into the high hills, away from others of its kind. Perfect, thought the wolf, and she called to the pack to come and follow her. They soon were tracing the trail, swiftly and silently.  The human had been stupid enough to cut itself and not staunch its wound. So stupid! It surely deserved to feed the pack. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The pack stayed disciplined, although the leader could sense its excitement as the blood trail grew fresher. When they reached the girl, she was already unconscious in the snow. The pack formed a circle around  her, working as one, prepared to strike on command. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A whirl of white rose in front of the girl. The largest polar bear the pack leader had ever seen stood guard over the girl. A young wolf, driven by hunger or bravado, challenged the bear by snapping at the girl’s outstretched hand. The bear batted him away, snapping his neck with one blow. The pack howled in frustration, but the pack leader backed down. An easy meal wasn’t worth dying for, she thought. The two wolves who did not follow her also lost their lives.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the wolves gone, the bear dug under the girl and managed to hold her against its warmth.  She would not die tonight at least. The bear examined her, its sigh over the cut on her cheek, and its human expression giving it away for the shaman in bear form it was. He cast healing spells on her, saving her life, and the use of her frozen foot, but could do nothing to prevent a long scar from forming down her cheek.  He was glad that he had come to investigate the strange cry he heard on the hillside. He settled in next to her for the remainder of the night, worried only that he could not heal the hurt that had driven her to such desperation.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ***************************************************************<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spring sat in a dark and quiet space. She felt no pain.  She was neither hungry nor thirsty, warm nor cold. When she first awoke there, emptiness and darkness stretched out beyond her in all directions as stood and turned around. So she sat, and had entirely given up trying to see. She expected this darkness might last for some long time, and let herself be lulled by her own breathing. She was grateful to be in this dark place.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your not dead, you know,” a voice broke her meditation. “I have just been allowed to speak to you for a moment.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ardrutha? Is that you?” Spring was on her feet in an instant turning around. She seemed to glimpse something light out of the corner of her eye, but as she turned toward it.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, dear one, it is me. And I haven’t long to talk...”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But how are you here? I...”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thought I would stop caring for you after I died?” Ardrutha laughed. “No, of course not. I have been following you as much as I can. You will need to go on with your life.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spring cried. “How can I go on with my life, without Breon? Knowing that as I become a better and better warrior, I will credit her, Freya. I will serve her with my life, when I despise what she is done.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The warrior’s path was never the only one open to you.” Spring thought she felt Ardrutha’s gentle hands stroke her neck, her hair, her face. “You believe in justice in your heart. Serving justice is something you promised me you would do, and Breon also. Live for us both child. Do justice in this world. ” Spring felt Ardrutha’s presence withdraw from the air around her then, taking with her the stability Spring had regained for a moment. “You will find your answer soon,” Ardrutha said as she took her leave.  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spring woke. It was midday, the sun was blindingly bright on the snow and ice. She sat up gingerly, noticing the blood on the snow, and the wolf corpses nearby.  Still crippled with loss, she began walking slowly down the mountain. Spring focused on the ice around her, bright and pure and cold. She knew then she had the answer Ardrutha said she would find. She would call this numbing cold, this stunning brightness into herself where the emptiness was now. She would use its strength to hold her mind, refine her into someone distant and just. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spring entered the village just after the warriors returned with what they could find of Breon’s remains. They’d found his head, still in the helm, and his left arm and leg. They suspected that goblins must have come upon his body after the giants had killed him, and desecrated it. Giants would not abuse a fallen foe in such a way.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The people milling about while Breon’s funeral pyre was being made could see that Spring had known of the death before she made her way into Halas. Her face was stern and remote, the gash on her cheek giving her a strange new focus for their eyes to seek. No one questioned her about her tattered clothing, her missing boot.  No one had the voice to speak to her at all.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The pyre had been constructed. Spring approached and questioned one of the men there.  He nodded and looked away from her, as she gently removed Breon’s pale head from his helm. A single tear rolled down her cheek, down the new trail her gash made. She laid his head softly on the pyre, bent to kiss his forehead and whisper something in his ear. She traced a finger on his cheek.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She stepped away from the pyre, and two shamans came forward to light it. They watched Spring carefully, prepared to stop her from jumping onto the flames herself. The fire blazed up, many feet above the heads of those assembled to  watch. Spring stepped forward toward the bright fire and turned to face all Halas.  She stood tall, and turned both her hands toward them palm forward and slightly raised from her body. She gathered her breath and spoke.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I will take this time, when we are here together, to Choose.” Her voice carried, strong and true. “This day, I have lost everything. Now I will leave everything behind.” She stopped to close her eyes, to steady her voice. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “ I leave behind my childhood. I leave with it my joy, my hope, and my innocence. Instead, I become winter’s creature. My heart had filled with ice. For the ice-rune, isa, I name myself Isaya.” She stood, swaying, and knew she had found her true name. She heard some people murmur the name to themselves, though whether they approved or not, she could not tell and did not care.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “For years, I have prepared myself for the path of warrior. Today, though, I will not choose that path. I cannot choose  that path, and be true to the memory of those I love.”  Many of the warriors sighed their relief at these words. While they knew Spring, that is, Isaya’s skill were good, they feared this announcement of choosing. They thought she would seek immediate revenge on the giants who killed Breon, and die herself. To lose her as a warrior was better than to lose her altogether.  “This day I choose the path of shaman. To preserve life of the good. To take life from the evil and unjust, till they plague the just no more. To serve justice, always.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some in the crowd applauded uneasily, others were silent. Isaya swallowed. She must say more. She prayed for wisdom to say the right words. “On the tundra, I encountered my mother. She calls herself Freya. On this day, of my Choosing, I choose not to follow the path she had planned for me.” She turned to face the sky. “Mother,  I reject you. I despise you,” she yelled. The crowd looked around apprehensively. Isaya reached for her dagger.  “I hate your likeness to me!” she gathered her red-gold hair into a thick bunch, and cut it off. Holding her hair high above her head, she  “I have chosen my own path. I will fight you till my last breath. And when I am worthy, I will take your name as my surname, to remind you, I have chosen for myself.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isaya turned and faced the pyre and threw her hair atop the flames.  People along the crowd’s edges began to wander away, disturbed,frightened that Isaya may have unleashed some angry force on Halas. Others stayed to watch her, as she stared into the fire. A strange transformation was taking place. Isaya’s hair, red-gold since her finding, was darkening to black. The gold fled from her complexion, leaving her wan and pale. No one moved to disturb her though or tell her she had changed. When nothing more happened, the villagers, pensive and upset,returned to their work. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isaya stayed, watching the flames. She had chosen, she had placed herself on the right path. She stood, until the flames died away, until the logs turned to coals, until the embers lost their sparks. She gathered up some ash, and put it in a small neck pouch. Without turning back, Isaya walked to the shaman’s hall to begin her training. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showPrevMessage?topicID=194.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showNextMessage?topicID=194.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic><img src=http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/Reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.threadControl?topicID=194.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=194.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=194.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themissednotefrm15">SEE the Missed Note<option value="themissednotethetavern">The Tavern<option value="themissednotethestage">The Stage<option value="themissednotetidbits">Tidbits<option value="themissednotetantrums">Tantrums  <option value="themissednotefrm11">Just for fun!<option value="themissednoteguildlinks">Links<option value="themissednotethepartyforum">The Party Forum<option value="themissednotetradesevents">Trades & Events<option value="themissednotetesting">Testing<option value="themissednotefrm12">Ghost thread</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage>The Stage</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
