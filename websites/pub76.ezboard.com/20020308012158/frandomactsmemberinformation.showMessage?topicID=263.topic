Since my young years, never did I think someone would make me feel like this way. That Fredolas might sometime write something like this, that I never doubted. Since we were both young, my friend always had at least one lady near him, looking at him with love in her eyes. But never did I recieve those glances. I much thought why this might be so. Finally, after walking up to vendor, to buy some food, I understood. After hearing him say &quot;I will not make any deals with a rogue like you!&quot;, I understood that it was not who I was, but what I was that stopped ladies from looking at me.<br>
But as I traveled around the world, I met other rogues, and these had ladies looking at them, and saying sweet words to them. But never did they notice me.<br>
So I once again had to think, why do not I recieve looks from ladies? And I understood. Ladies like men that do not have furry feet. All my life, people had commented on my furry feet. Jokes that I always had seen as good-natured suddenly seemed degrading.I tried to wear boots, to cover my feet, but no boots could hide my furryness, and they made walking very painfull.<br>
But then came my luck. I found out that there was a mask, a mask that would give the illusion that I was a Dark Elf. Knowing them to be both tall and furrless, I devoted much time to obtain this mask. And I got one. After that, many more ladies noticed me, and it made me happy. But since the effect of my mask is only temporary, it needs to be renewed every now and then. In the heat of battle, it is hard to renew it. So many a lady have told me &quot;Oh, so you're a halfling?&quot; After that, the glances are gone, no more do they talk sweet to me.<br>
But one day, in the owlbear-caves of the Hollowshade Moor if I remember correctly, I met a lady. This was a lady like no one else. She summoned a companion to her side, and a small rockhopper came to her call. When my traitor illusion dropped, and after I had renewed it, she asked me to cancel it. She said it scared her little pet. Since I liked this lady, I did as she asked. The other two people in the cave now commented that this rockhopper was big enough to be my steed. They laughed. Well I thought, another shorty-joke. I was used to them. But the lady did not laugh. She said that she would be proud if her pet would be my steed. For the first time ever, I felt happy for being a halfling. After that, she has called me her &quot;little furryfeet&quot;. And I know, she does not say it as a cruel joke, not even as a joke at all. She says it, bacause that is what I am. It has taken me time to understand it, but I love this lady, love her more then I thought I could ever love someone.<br>
The lady is Shadowlace.<br>
So why do I write this? Well, I write it so that you all know. I love her. I know she is soon to be married, but I will always love her. I will not feel bitter or angry about the wedding, I will feel happy about it. I know Shadowlace loves Vodar, and he loves her. Her happiness is all I care about.<br>
But I will keep calling her my love. I will not deny the love I feel, that would only take me back to where I was before she made me understand that I should love me for who and what I am.<br>
My love, I will come to the wedding, and I will be happy for you.<br>
You will always be my love. <p><FONT face="Footlight MT Light" color="red"><FONT size=6>
