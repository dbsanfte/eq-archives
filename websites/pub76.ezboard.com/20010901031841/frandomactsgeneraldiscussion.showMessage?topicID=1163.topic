First, I was able to help defeat Naggy in her lair with about 40 other people.  Second, I was also able to attend a raid to the plane of Hate.<br>
<br>
Though both raids had some similar aspects and many of the same people, overall they were quite different.<br>
<br>
I will explain the raid on Naggy for two reasons.  One, I always wanted to know what went on during a raid and two, it was the most fun out of the two.<br>
<br>
First, I had to get up really early to make my way to the meeting spot at Lavastorm at the Druid Ring.  Before I got there, I had to meet Kaymar who volunteeered her uber resist jewelry for me to wear on the raid.  You see, on this particular raid, Magic and fire resists are of much importance.<br>
<br>
After receiving the resist gear I then headed to Lavastorm to meet the other raiders.<br>
<br>
Upon reaching LS, I was given some explicit instructions.<br>
1) Turn off all spell effects<br>
2) unless a cleric, turn on server side filtering.<br>
3) when we get ready to fight naggy, make sure to have walk on instead of run (due to AoE fear spell, so you don't go too far away when and if feared)<br>
<br>
There were several other prep instructions, but mainly to put on your LFG tag so the raid leader could put us in appropriate groups.  This raid and the Hate raid were run by Mallo and the Gathering of Banners.  I had heard Mallo ran a good raid, and they were right.<br>
<br>
Group leaders were picked by Mallo...mostly people he knew and trusted to get done what needed to get done.  These group leaders were then instructed to pick up certain people and make their groups.  Each group is then given a group number.<br>
<br>
The most important key for any raid is to follow the raid leaders instructions, no matter what.  He is the one that shouts orders and tells a group when to move, attack or what not.<br>
<br>
We entered Solb as instructed a few groups at a time, so as not to over crowd the entrance.  Slowly we made our way to where we would meet our first foes, the Fire Giants.   A team of two monks were the pullers of the day and teamed up to try and single pull the giants.<br>
<br>
This worked relatively well for the first few fights.  One battle though ended in several deaths when 5 giants or so were pulled at one time.  No biggie because we had several clerics there to rez with 90% exp back or better.  I conveniently went LD in the middle of the fight and missed most of the action on that one.<br>
<br>
After the FG's, which took no time at all, we then started to prepare for Naggy.  This is the long and boring part.  It is what is called the Buff Circle.  <br>
<br>
The idea of the Buff Circle is to buff each and every person with the appropriate buffs.  Casters get groovy caster buffs, Meleer's get melee buffs.  The raid leader hand picks a group of buffers.  They then form a line and wait.  Next, the raid leader then instructs the groups to come down, one at a time to go through the buff line.  Once buffed, that player then camps out and joins a predetermined chat room.<br>
<br>
Reason for this is, so that the buffs are not lost while waiting for all the others to get buffed.  This takes some time (about hour and half for us) before everyone was ready to log back into the game.<br>
<br>
Once back in, the Raid leader then informs everyone to get back into their groups.  He will then call out which groups go in first for the first wave of attack.<br>
<br>
Luckily, I was in the first wave!!  Very exciting stuff.  We lined up outside Naggy's door.  Then the order is given to attack and we run in...trying hard to pound on the extremely large dragon.  This is where those magic and fire resists come in handy.  Out of all the damage she dealt me ( I died too) I was never hurt by magic, nor feard (THANKS KAY!!).  She did swat me like a little bug while I was trying to take a screenshot, but we defeated her non the less!<br>
<br>
After everyone is rezzed, the raid leader then loots Naggy and tells any one that can use certain no drop items to roll.   Once the no drop items are rolled for, then the other items are then rolled for.<br>
<br>
The Gathering of Banners has a wonderful, fair way of letting people roll and I suggest visiting their site to see the rules.  <br>
<br>
Overall, this experience was great!  Balamur even rezzed me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , thanks Bal...<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just wanted to share what a raid is like to those that had been wondering.  Of course, this thing is probably too long and boring to read the whole way through lol... ohh well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Thanks to Mallo and GoB!!<br>

There is however one thing I been wondering about, are there any bards who joins the raids. I mean you hear about the casters and about the melees, but among which of them does the bard fit in in these levels? Judging from the things I've heard it sometimes seems as if all the bards does in higher lvls is playing that mana song. So if anyone can, please tell me what a bard does in theese levels, melee or instruments?<br>
<br>
Ok, that's it. I'm going off topic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Maybe I should ask this on the bard sites.

Um my day to answer questions on Random Acts message boards.<br>
<br>
Bards love them to death.  Always want a bard in the Main Assist group for Nagafen.  For the Resist Song.<br>
<br>
For Hate would love to have four Bards every trip for the first four tank groups. Haste, Heal, and once Katryna when we were up with one Chanter was backup Mezzer and she got a real work out at one point.<br>
<br>
Nagafen is more fun.  That raid tends to build and then end.  Hate is a grind goes better when the loot is better though.<br>
<br>
Necros?  DoT, DD, Pets, umm back up healer, back up Mez (love Screaming Terror on caster MoBs).  Oh and that mana dump thing they get.<br>

&quot;*ahem* BARDS GET THE HIGHEST GROUP RESISTS IN THE GAME.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amen, brother Bal, and I will touch on the Resisto-bard in the series I'm writing in the Tips forum.<br>
<br>
Just an example - at level 22 or so, after a 24 cleric applied Endure Magic, I cranked up Guardian Rhythms and Elemental Rhythms with drum equipped (they stack).  Our MR was over 130 for the whole group, without any major MR gear on-hand.  A higher level bard with a good percussion instrument (say, Mistmoor Battle Drums or better yet Nostrolo's Tambourine) would be stratospheric.<br>
<br>
For lower level groups, this means you can take on casters and Evil Eyes and such.  I imagine that for a dragon raid, the combo above would be mighty welcome. :wink<br>
