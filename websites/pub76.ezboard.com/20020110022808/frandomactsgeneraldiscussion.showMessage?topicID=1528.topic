* Soulbinders *<br>
<br>
A new group has appeared in Norrath (and on Luclin as well). Rumor has it that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves to research on the power and essence of our inner being. Some call them fanatics, as they claim that knowledge of the spirit that dwells within will lead them to an understanding of the whole of existence. Citizens often treat them with the same respect and distance that they treat the Priests of Discord. However, these Soulbinders have dedicated themselves to public service, and for them that service falls along their lines of specialty...<br>
<br>
The next time you find yourself far away from home, you might seek the services of a Soulbinder.<br>
<br>
/ooc: We've added these &quot;Soulbinder&quot; NPCs to all cities that player characters can start in, as well as Shadowhaven and Iceclad at the request of players. It is our hope that these new NPCs will help players by reducing the time it takes to find a bind from another player character.<br>

As a very young cleric, donations from binds provided me with money for food and spells.  This was particularly important to me since I spent most of my time in groups sitting on my rear medding and not looting (thus, I often didn't get much money from hunting).  Well, now we can kiss that source of income goodbye for young clerics everywhere.<br>
<br>

<br>
and then only in cities...<br>
<br>
this is a good thing.  somehow I think the casters will manage without this little bit of income.  Clerics especially, like when people start offering 500pp per rez in the later levels.<br>
<br>
and, if you are in a group that does not share the loot or the money drops, that just ain't right, you deserve a fair split.  only time we don't split the money is when a monk does not want the weight.<br>

At what level do you start getting the 500PP for rezzes?  <br>
<br>
The vast majority of the ones I do are free.  I never, ever ask for money, and many, many people do not even offer.  <br>
<br>
Obviously, I'm not talking about guildmembers here -- guild rezzes are always free, end of discussion.  I'm talking about random people who ask me to stop what I'm doing and often to travel to wherever they are.  To spend my time (sometimes up to and over an hour) and mana and often to risk my own life to save them theirs.  Who bombard me with tells every 90 seconds asking if I'm on the way.  Who tell me once I arrive, oh, never mind, someone else already did it (then I'm left to find my way back to wherever it was I started from).<br>
<br>
While I often decline donations (particularly if I wasn't busy or grouped and did not have to travel), it would still be nice if the decision to be paid was mine instead of theirs.  <br>
<br>
I am not now, nor have I ever been wealthy (although I'm finally somewhat comfortable).  All my life, I've seen people auctioning things for thousands of plat and wondered, where do they get all the money?  I never even cracked the 1,000pp threshhold until I was in my 40s.<br>
<br>
With regard to begging and paying for binds, don't you have to do that for TPs and TLs as well?  I did and still do (well, I ask, but rarely beg).  But no one ever seems to complain about that at all.  And I'm willing to bet (for argument sake only -- I can't afford to bet for money <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) there are far fewer freebie TPs and TLs done than there are freebie rezzes.<br>
<br>
And while bind donations may be a &quot;little bit of income&quot; for a level 25 or 30 or higher, for a level 14 those 5 and 10pp supplements mean a lot to a poor, struggling young cleric.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I see this as a slap in the face to young clerics everywhere, trying to make an honest living.  Those of us who didn't have a rich uncle throwing plat and uber gear at us. Those of us who ran around in tattered leather and scavenged every dead body we passed in hopes that a few meager coppers would be left on them.  Those of us who had to decide whether to buy spells or food or try to scrape together enough for a single piece of banded.<br>
<br>
Money has always been a sore point for me. <p><table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img

This became a real problem in Qeynos at one point, as sometimes there would be no one in North or South Qeynos high enough to bind!<br>
<br>
Long before I joined RA I was saying &quot;Casters loot!&quot;  And if a single member in an FFA group was ninja-looting everything in sight, I'd speak up.  Alpha looting is certainly the way to go in pickup groups so you can avoid this problem.<br>
<br>
I suspect this is part of a larger effort to try and shave off downtime.  While it certainly may have a negative impact on a small number of players, it's going to improve the game for a lot more.  <br>

<br>
As a wizard, we are stuck on our butts medding 80% of the time that we are in a group.  We monitor hit points of players and mobs by using the assist key.  When necessary and the time is right, we stand, nuke and sit our little butts right back down.  In a quick pulling group, this is the only way we can keep our mana up to be of use.  Just like Eme said, we rarely get the opportunity to loot, and even if you are in a group that tries to make looting fair (Which is extremely rare in a pick-up group), with fast pulling we can not afford to quit medding to loot.  Usually it is a mute point because the meat shields loot everything as soon as it dies anyway.  <br>
<br>
Add to that, we have no buffs to cast on anyone so we are unable to sell a sow, breeze or get donations for healing.  The ONLY thing we have to offer until we begin to get group teleports at 29th level, was a bind.  I was lucky in this respect.  I have good friends that keep the pocketbook oiled and when I'm lucky enough to group with most RA members, it's always a fight to get people to loot, not a fight to have them share.  Unfortunately 95% of Norrath is not as polite.  The poor little newbie wizzies have nothing to pimp but their binds.  <br>
<br>
Spells and spell research cost us dearly.  Total, for my 24th lvl spells and the research involved... (buying runes, doing the research skill journeyman practice, buying spells...) I spent between $450.00 and $500.00 pp.  I understand the warrior argument that they must continue to upgrade their armor and weapons... but casters must continue to upgrade their weapons, i.e. their spells, also.  And we MUST do it every 4 or 5 levels.  Try earning $500.00 pp between level 20 and 24 experience hunting.  Heck, at that level the only reasonable source of loot hunting is the Gypsy GLS quest.  Poor clerics are stuck in both worlds... needing expensive armor and buying spells.<br>
<br>
In my oppinion, Verant continues to hobble the casters of Norrath.  Sow is slowly becoming unnecessary with horses, T-boots and J boots.  Granted, J boots have been around for a long time but were a pain in the rear-end to get.  Now for the right amount of cash you can just buy T boots or a horse.  I'm sure there are already some twinks on some server that have a lvl 1 character with a horse.  Who needs droods and shammys anymore?<br>
I've already heard this one in an OOC.  Someone needed a port.  He was advised that instead of paying for a port, he just head to Luclin and then port himself down to wherever he wants to go by using the Nexus.  Intercontinent ports were a serious source of income for droods and wizzies.  Who needs them now?<br>
The increase in the bind wound cap for warriors negates a dire need for clerics.  <br>
Chanters are still lucky with the breeze and clarity spells... but how long will this cashcow last?<br>
<br>
On the surface, this would seem like a good idea; but everytime some &quot;luxury&quot; is given to the people that don't have it, something special is taken away from another class.  Meat shields may not agree with me...but it effects you also.  Now that pallies and shadownuts move to the warrior combat tables at 51... what do you have to offer?  Pally can LoH, heal, stun and out taunt you.  Shadownuts can Harmtouch, bring a pet, share health.  Let's see... warriors can.... uh... kick!  Yeah you can kick!  This situation is JUST as wrong as the others I listed.  Rogues... how long until anyone stanging behind a creature can backstab?  Don't write it off... it is very possible that this could happen sometime in the future.<br>
<br>
In conclusion... every class should be special.  When we homogenize them so that every class can do everything and needs no other... why bother playing?  <br>

I know how it is to not have time to loot.  As a puller, I am constatly having to pull, pull pull, while the others wait behind, with sometimes very little time to loot.<br>
<br>
That is why I stress that you casters should get a fair share of the loot, ALWAYS, no ifs, ands or buts...always, you deserve as much as any other group member.<br>
<br>
We are all in the same situation....very few classes are just rich classes.  It is the players themselves that make their character rich.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have had to sell all my stuff from my alts just to keep Uriel armored for his level.  I am not rich nor do I win tons of loot.  I do make sure though that the groups (if not RA groups) roll fairly and share fairly, or I am out the door....<br>
<br>
Like you, not charging for rezzes or whatnot, I never ever charge for sow, buffs or tracking.  If someone offers me the plat, I turn it down...always have always will.  But, clerics on the other hand, should charge for rezzes...because it takes alot of your time and mana.  You deserve it.<br>
<br>
But, to say I have to wait till someone can bind me in a strange zone or have to pay for a bind...well, I just shouldn't have to.<br>
<br>
I am glad for the change, it was needed and helpful.  Binding to me is not a class thing, and I wish it wasn't suppose to be...binding somewhere should be allowed by anyone in my opinion.  I can understand ports, rezzes and TL's...but a bind?<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is a good topic and brings up a lot of interesting theories and opinions.  I kind of like it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Makes the board a little more interesting.<br>

As a melee'er, however, I'm very pleased to know that I don't have to rely on players for a bind anymore.<br>
<br>
I know that's a blow to young casters who NEED that money from donations to buy your insanely overpriced spells (note, I'm being serious, not sarcastic...those spells are WAAAY overpriced).  However, as a melee'er, I've personally sat on my arse, shouting and begging for a bind, offering up to 10 plat even, for over an hour.  60+ minutes.  When I can only come on and play for 2 or 3 hours, that's a big dent in the experience.  I've actually just logged off in disgust because I couldn't get a freakin' bind.  Not that there weren't people in the zone that couldn't cast it.  There were.  Just no one had time to come bind me.  (I don't fault them for it, heck if I was having fun blasting things and getting exp and such, I wouldn't want to run to the other side of the zone to bind some inky.)<br>
<br>
And as a final note, I'd reserve the final judgement until we know how much these Soulbinders charge.  For all we know, it may turn out to be a bargain to pay a young caster 5 plat for a bind, as opposed to going to the greedy Soulbinders.  I mean, those guys have to pay for the cult parties down at the Maiden's Fancy somehow... <p><center>

I find binding people is a nuisance.  I have always done it because it’s necessary and I’ve felt it’s my duty but I can never find the dang spell in my book and it takes too long for the icon to pop once it’s memmed.   I've never taken a donation for a bind, never.  <br>
<br>
I have taken donations for ports and I won’t knock the value of a resurrection.  I am willing to bet though, that a Cleric would be very very busy giving out free resurrections to come even close to the number of free ports and TL’s that I’ve given.<br>
<br>
<br>
The WOW part I think is directed at the fishing changes.<br>

Yes spells are expensive, yes medding means you dont get to loot as much, but man, waiting an HOUR /ooc'ing for a bind just sucks.  I think now that the server has gotten older, there are fewer 'true' newbies who hang around the city gates looking to bind folks for a donation.  Seriously I waited 45 minutes the last time I was in freeport, going back and forth to EC /auction /ooc'ing for a bind.  <br>
<br>
As far as the folks saying they can just port up to the nexus...that's a load of crap really.  Total time for porting up to the nexus + porting back down + running to the zone where you wanted to go = at least 30 minutes.  At least, not including the time it takes to RUN to the zone where you can port.  Time it takes for a wizard to TL you to the zone you want to go = 10 seconds?  Folks will still pay out the nose for TL/TP's, even with the luclin portals.  Because its all about time.  My time is worth more than sitting around waiting on the Nexus, and I'll gladly pay some wizard/druid (the younger the better in my book) to port my sorry butt somewhere.  <br>
<br>
Folks should pay for rezz's I think.  A cleric does have a crapload of spells/regents they have to buy.  Even a 20pp donation is more than zero.  I've Always at least tried to make some sort of donation when I got a rezz, just because its the right thing to do.  At the very least I try to carry a few peridots on me to give to the clerics.  <br>

I accept donations for any reason you feel like giving me money. I'm not too good for your money, I did stop what I was doing (even if that was just loitering) to help you out. You want to give me a plat? Cool. You want to give me 100? Excellent.<br>
<br>
Yes, I turn them down occasionally (like when a level 10 is trying to give me a plat for a bind, if they are legit that's a big chunk of change). But anyone who's got good gear or is above 30th level I wouldn't refuse a donation.<br>
<br>
Balamur has never been rich, and by current &quot;average&quot; statistics (of which most of us are not) I'm broke as a dog. At 52nd level I have about 5,300 plat banked. And it's taken me 52 levels to bank that much, without making very many large purchases. For 30 levels I collected copper that the monks dropped, 30 levels of copper collecting changed into 230 plat. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I have some groovy gear I could sell for some more cash, but I absolutely hate selling (and buying) I never know what's a fair price.<br>
<br>
Anyhow... I'm sure at 20th 5,300 plat may sound like a lot. But it's not, because I cannot buy anything that would be an improvement for me for that much (except maybe one or two items). And it would be such a small improvement it's not worth it for me to spend that much on it. So I hoarde and hope some day I'll be able to buy one cool thing.<br>
<br>
As for making money at low level, all I have to say is fire beetles in north ro. Up until 16th level I would spend half my day leveling and half my day killing fire beetles for the 2 silver per eye offer the innkeep had. By 10th level I had a full set of banded armor I paid for myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><hr align="center" width="80%" size="2">

If, in fact the Soulbinders CHARGE for their binds, say 25pp per bind, it won't be nearly so bad.  The young clerics and other bindables can easily undercut these prices and actually make a fair amount of supplemental income.  <br>
<br>
However, I when I see the words &quot;...these Soulbinders have dedicated themselves to public service...&quot;, I interpret that to mean they're binding for free.  Hard to undercut free.<br>
<br>
I suppose we'll just have to see how it turns out.<br>
<br>
Regarding wasting time waiting for binds... I've spent <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  and continue to spend</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> my fair share of <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> time</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> and <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> money</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> on transportation.

For me personaly I think the bind ability is great since it saves me from begging in ooc which always takes a really long time since I mostly play at low populated hours. <br>
<br>
Yes, it is a loss for young casters, but as Ailu said noone has yet stated what the prise will be. To this I must add life as a young bard. Bards need weapons, armor, instruments and songs. Ouch, lots of expenses. Let's check the income sources. <br>
<br>
Services to sell - nope, who wants to buy stuff that only lasts for a few seconds. <br>
<br>
Loot - nope if you are a good bard, during fighting you twist three songs ,when fighting is done you turn on heal or mana. By that time someone usually already have looted, if not the loot is to far away so if you go for it you will go out of range for the group to benefit from your song.<br>
<br>
So I saved every spiderling leg I could find and sold it to make cp. I was like almost Scroouge and I worked really hard and one day I could afford bronze leggings. Oh what a joy. After that, well I joined this guild and ever since then I am a twink. Almost everything I got has been given to me by guild members. Lately I have been even worse twinked, since I do have a 53 paladin as fiance. But that is another story.<br>
<br>
Just my two cp that tells that a young bards life is hard too without wealthy friends. <p><table>

So I'm gonna cut in. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When i was a wee strugglin' chanter, I used to make good money (a plat!) bindin' folks. That money came at a time when spells were expensive and income was rare.<br>
<br>
Casters (particularly the cleric, but to a great degree the enchanter, too) need to med between pulls. If the cleric ain't meddin' then the whole group is slowed up. What that means is the cleric almost never loots. The enchanter rarely loots. These classes do need money to afford spells, but the cleric is particularly hosed 'cause they also need armor. Once ya make it to about level 20 or 30, the spells become quite affordable and money becomes less of an issue.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, I can afford my spells with the little cash I scrounge up so I'm happy. But, Uriel, yer theory that every class is entitled to even loot just don't work fer the most part. The only groups where I git fair loot (and that includes when I group with you folks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) is when I hunt with Lunacy. They have a largely guild-wide master looter policy. That means when guild members group together, we designate a master looter who shares out the goods at the end of the night. Of course, sometimes everyone fergits about sharin' the loot at the end so it ain't done. That's when someone walks away accidentally rich. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, if I walk away with more than 1pp of loot for a few hours of groupin', then I consider myself lucky. I often walk away with less. But that don't matter to me 'cause my spells are so cheap (relatively) these days.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> BUT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, I'll have to say, I like this change Verant made. Waitin' an hour fer a caster to wander by just plain stinks. <p><BR>

Mana = no cost WHAT SO EVER!<br>
<br>
So how come ppl charge 20pp or more for ports? Not only ask it, DEMAND it! They only have to sit down like 2 mins to get the mana back.<br>
<br>
Same thing with bind. My characters DO NOT accept donations for bind/sow/buff, unless the person gives me money 3 times over, saying it will break his heart if I do not take the money.<br>
<br>
And do not think that young meleers have it as bad as casters. Meleers have to get armor, when you get spells. Weapons etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
There! Of course not all do what I just said, charge 20pp or so, but I know quite a few that do.<br>
<br>
Anyway, soulbinders = Wonderfull! Seems many ppl just &quot;miss&quot; those &quot;Looking for bind, please, will donate&quot; untill they see &quot;Looking for bind, will pay 30pp&quot;<br>

But 99% of the time no I dont take money for ports. When I was 29 and just starting out with tping, and needed the money ya the donations were great. But to insist on money , never done that. The thing with binds, I can see how that will be a loss of income for lower casters trying to make some money for spells , armor, etc. It was a good way to make a little money. Now they take that away to. But on the other hand I can see the point of people who cant bind themselves , they no longer have to wait for someone to come along that is willing to do it. So I can see both sides of the issue, just still feel it is taking something away from young casters looking to make a little money.<br>

<br>
I've looked for the 'soulbinders' in FP and Felwithe, and they're not in the best spots, if you ask me. Sure, the one in Felwithe is just inside the gate, but the whole zone of G Fay is bind wherever, so bindng in Felwithe is a waste of zoning time.<br>
<br>
As for Freeport, Ailu hit the nail on the head. Most evil races can't get that far into the city, making a bind at the zone edge much more to their liking.<br>
<br>
And, as far as the money issue goes, its all a matter of worth. An item or service is only worth what it's worth to you. For example, if I'm in a hurry to get to somewhere, then 10pp may be a reasonable fee for the TL or TP. Same with a bind. If I can't go into a city to get the free bind at the soulbinders, then anyone willing to come to me deserves some gratuity, because of the convenience for me.<br>
<br>
