This be a place to do so,&quot; and she led Kesryn to a chair that felt certainly to be magic, and pulling off a dusty white sheet that had been covering it, welcomed Kesryn to the chair. The chair molded to his thoughts of comfort, and Xanta watched with amusement as it formed. <br>
<br>
Crouching down to Kesryn's knee, adjusting her skirts around her, Xanta said, &quot;Sir, there seems to be a mix up, is this what you suggest? Perhaps if you tell us who you believe yourself to be, we might find out who you were... well, aside from whom I believe you to be. But I digress, I will offer you this....<br>
<br>
&quot;Once, in Norrath, there was a Dragon Lord. He was something of a deity, he had the ability to slay dragon and mortal alike, he could summon one to him if he cared to, he could change memory, and one day one could wake up, with an entirely different name, their lives changed forever. He was a kind man, with quite the wit, from what I recall. I remember offering him a bit of food and water once, conjured myself, if I recall correctly, and I confess subjecting him to an attempt to strengthen him, wrapping him in spells to guard him, for my amusement. I giggled at the thought of making the strong stronger. If you be the same, perhaps I owe an apology. But that is no large thing. As my father would say to me, 'Xanta, we have bigger fish to fry, so get busy and head to the market.'&quot; Here Xanta looked a bit confused, how did she remember what her father had said, suddenly she remembered his voice. She shook her head a bit, not wanting to think of this now, but wanting to recall it for later.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ani, you may want to fetch Darkmask from the kitchen,&quot; Xanta giggled. &quot;He's slippery as a fish, he is,&quot; she added, smiling.  <p><br><center><a href=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/XantaEverlost3Finale1.jpg><I>Life Size Version of the Love of Darkmask</i><BR><img src=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/XantaDisillusion2.jpg><font face=times new roman><font size=3><BR><i><B><a href=http://pub50.ezboard.com/bgardenofearthlydelights> The Garden of Earthly Delights</a><BR>Patron of <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The Missed Note</a><i></b></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/umistressrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress Rain</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000000>(11/29/01 12:09:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=555.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.circleofpride.com/files/Rain height=160 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .. memories</span><hr size=1>     Leaving Nek woods had probably been the best idea Rainana had had since breakfast. The newbie log lost its sense of helplessness once everyone around her became strong enough to fend for themselves. She needed her own journey, her own adventure. The only bad thought that came around that option was the fact the sky had already began to darken and she had not eaten since her early am snack. <br>
    There had once been a place just around the corner that she had called home for a while. It helped her to recover from the heartache of losing a male friend named Lok. Last time she had entered the missed note the only remaining person was her elven waitress friend. And she had not looked so well. Sure she bounced around and made drinks and tried to keep the place clean, but there was a saddness in her heart that her eyes reflected. It was as if her soul was trying to tell her secrets, but her mouth just didnt want to move. <br>
    As the memories streamed throughout her head, Rainana's feet lead her to the unforgotten note. Laughter and joy seeped through the walls as she stepped into the cobweb covered door. None of the faces seemed familiar, perhaps they had been friends of her sister Ninou.. one never knew who all knew her. The thought brought a small smile to her face as she asked the strangers for a room.<br>

 Kesryn allows himself to be lead to the chair and sits down. The chair seems confused for a moment, as if not sure how to conform itself to Kesryn's idea of comfort. . .then settles.<br>
<br>
 He listens as Xanta spins her tale.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Me....a diety?&quot;, he shakes his head, &quot;I surely do not feel as such now. Perhaps you have me confused with another, I cannot recal doing any of these things that you say.&quot; His brow furrows, &quot;I cannot recal much of anything.

<br>
Xanta shuffles around the bar, fetching a tall glass, realizes it's been a bit dusty, finds the sink. Finding a sliver of soap, she draws water into the sink, and washes the glass. Holding it to the light, she tilts her head, and gasps and smiles at the light hitting the water, making pinpoints of light. The glass is clear, with minor imperfections, hand blown, apparently. She fills this glass with water, the water clearer than the glass. She fetches a goblet, and fills it with wine. Choices are good. Sometimes, one can have everything, with no consequence.<br>
<br>
She returns to Kesryn, bringing him the water, and the wine. &quot;May this refresh you, and bring you some measure of fulfillment,&quot; Xanta says. &quot;If you don't mind my asking, what do you remember? Images? Sensation?&quot;<br>
<br>
Xanta wonders if Kesryn's memory loss ties in with her own forgetting of childhood, and her sense of something &quot;missing&quot; here, not a note, but, a .. drifting. Almost like a snow bank, in Everfrost, she thinks. She waits, listening, trying to ponder what it means. <p><br><center><a href=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/XantaEverlost3Finale1.jpg><I>Life Size Version of the Love of Darkmask</i><BR><img src=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/XantaDisillusion2.jpg><font face=times new roman><font size=3><BR><i><B><a href=http://pub50.ezboard.com/bgardenofearthlydelights> The Garden of Earthly Delights</a><BR>Patron of <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The Missed Note</a><i></b></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ubeltanebuttercup.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beltane Buttercup</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://beltane.hypermart.net/pics/ezboardicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000000>(11/29/01 12:20:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=555.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Discovery of a Dusty Place</span><hr size=1> Beltane violently jerks awake from her nightmare. <br>
&quot;Not again!&quot; she mumbles realizing she is in her own bed, safe, deep within her home, Ak'anon.<br>
The nightmares are becoming more ferocious, making it harder to sleep each passing evening.  She sighs, stretches, and sits up in her bed.  Her eyes, small but intense like magical ambers, focus on her calendar across the room.  She pushes a small red button, labeled &quot;Number 1&quot;, on her nightstand.  Instantly a clockwork gnome enters the room.<br>
&quot;Good morning, Beltane!  What would you like for breakfast?&quot;  the clockwork gnome robotically sputtered out.<br>
Beltane replied, in very precise, almost calculating tone, &quot;Toast.  Rabbit; cooked medium well.  You tell that cook, if he burns my rabbit, he'll deal with my wrath today, may Brell help me!  I think that will be all for today.. except..&quot; an evil grin comes over Beltane's face, &quot;perhaps, Number 1, could you ask the cook for some High Elf&quot;?<br>
Number 1 is silent for a few moments, &quot;The cook will be happy to prepare all that you have requested&quot;.  I shall return in 15.33 minutes with your breakfast, Beltane.&quot;<br>
Perfect, Beltane thought to herself, enough time to dress and prepare for the day, she pressed button &quot;Number 2&quot;.<br>
Number 2 entered the room, looking exactly the same as the other clockwork gnome, walking in the exact same pattern, &quot;Good morning, Beltane!  Which outfit shall I prepare for you today&quot;?<br>
Beltane thought a moment, &quot;I will need my traveling gear, Number 2&quot;.<br>
&quot;Yes, sir&quot; Number 2 wizzed off quickly and returned with a huge, dusty, trunk.  Number 2's body made some cranking noises as the trunk was placed on the ground before Beltane.<br>
&quot;Leave me now, Number 2&quot;  Beltane stared at the trunk.<br>
She slowly walked towards the trunk, stopping just an inch from it.  The trunk was approximately four feet long by two feet long and three feet deep.  Three Beltane's could fit in this trunk.  Beltane closed her eyes.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Blood.  Fighting.  Crying.  The beast is dead.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She shivered.  She opened her eyes, and produced from a necklace around her neck a key.  She lowered her neck close enough to open the trunk with the key.  Click.  A small amount of dust lept away from the drunk.  Beltane sneezed.<br>
The door to her room slammed opened, &quot;Beltane is sick!  Beltane is sick!  Start a hot bath and get her some more blankets&quot;!<br>
&quot;No, Number 2, I am fine, go away now&quot; she sternly told the clockwork.  &quot;Stupid machines&quot;.<br>
The door closed and Beltane looked down at the trunk again.  She stood up and put all her strength into opening the trunk.  After her second attempt, and tired arms, the trunk gave way and sprang open. <br>
Beltane backed away immediately, almost as if something awful might spring out and attack her.  She uncoiled herself and walked slowly back to the trunk.  She carefully touched the runes marked on the inside of the lid.  Then she looked into the trunk.  Armor that had not been touched in years.  She touched it an closed her eyes.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Cathedrals.  An island in the ocean.  Gems, lots of gems.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She was shivering uncontrolably.<br>
A soft knock at her door interupted her day dreaming.  &quot;Who is it&quot; she inquired.<br>
&quot;Tis me, friend&quot; the familiar cooks voice at the door.<br>
Beltane rose from the trunk and opened the door.  The cook dropped her breakfast as he layed eyes on the trunk.<br>
&quot;Where?  What?  You can't do this to me now&quot;! Balastin screamed at her as he was looking and pointing at the trunk.<br>
&quot;I have to, you have never understood&quot; Beltane sulked.  &quot;Nevermind, I didn't really want breakfast&quot; she protested.<br>
Balastin stood in the doorway, staring at the trunk, still unable to move.  &quot;Well, I did bring you this..&quot; he wheeled in a cake.  Beltane smiled, they both smiled.<br>
&quot;You are the best cook, you knew exactly what I wanted&quot; she said.<br>
&quot;Of course&quot;! He replied.<br>
&quot;I get the head&quot;!  Beltane chipped in rather loudly looking down at her cake that Balastin had made for her in the shape of a high elf.<br>
Balastin produced a knife from his chef's apron, &quot;Cut away, friend&quot;.<br>
&quot;OFF WITH YOUR HEAD, XANTA&quot;!  Beltane's eyes grew huge as the knife came down quickly but precisely, she sliced off the high elves head with great enthusiasm.<br>
They both laughed and ate some cake.<br>
&quot;What of this trunk, Beltane.  Tell me you are not off on some journey.  I recollect that you retired some time ago, which has put my heart at great ease, friend!  Tell me you are just looking for sentimental reasons&quot;.  Balastin looked her directly in the eyes squarely, hoping to find the truth there.<br>
&quot;I have to go.  The company of gnomes is grand.  I almost could not ask for better company.  I have friends out there I have not seen in years&quot;  she looked at him eagerly, hoping for approval.<br>
&quot;I see.  But what of the travel to get there&quot;? he quizzed her.<br>
She winked flitatiously at him.<br>
&quot;No! I will not be a part of your undoing!  I cannot, will not, shall not, no, no, no&quot;.  he sounded like a crazed man.<br>
&quot;Please, just to the commons&quot;.<br>
He sighed.  &quot;If you die, how will I forgive myself&quot;?<br>
&quot;I won't die.  I'm a templar!  You can be such an incredibly silly gnome sometimes&quot; she smiled widely at him.  &quot;Besides, I have Brell at my side&quot; she pinched that in just as he rebuted.<br>
&quot;Brell will do you no good, you should stay here, in good gnome company, good food, safe surroundings.  No one dare attack the great city of Ak'anon&quot;! Balastin was working himself up into a frenzy.<br>
&quot;No, I will not stay.  I have a debt to repay, a rematch to... rematch..and I will go whether you like it or not!  The truth of the matter is that I cannot be kept here!  A lifetime of traveling has made me uneasy and to keep me here is a crime&quot;  her voice rising with each word.<br>
Balastin sat down wearily, looking at the trunk as he slowly massaged his chin with the tips of his hand.<br>
The room was quiet, both of them staring at the trunk.<br>
&quot;I got this in the mail a week ago, friend&quot; her voice almost a whisper now.  She handed him an envelope with the common elven writing on it.  The seal on the envelope, which had already been broken by Beltane, was the seal of The Companions.  Balastin frowned when he saw the seal.  Without opening it, he handed the envelope back to her.<br>
&quot;When will you be ready to go&quot;?<br>
&quot;I have to get my armor out, find my spellbook, and pack my bags with anything that I might need; it should take me about two hours&quot; she said quietly to him.<br>
&quot;Fine&quot; he replied quickly, &quot;I will get you some food to take, be ready in two hours, I shall return&quot;.  And with that he walked out of the room and slammed the door.<br>
The trunk released a little more dust and then a glitter arose from the trunk.  Beltane walked over to it, &quot;Not now, trusty sprinkler.. soon perhaps&quot;.  She started to take her armor out of the trunk.<br>
 <br>
***<br>
<br>
Balastin returned in two hours to a Beltane fully suited in her Templar armor.  She stood there, quietly &quot;It's stiff.  But it doesn't creak at least&quot;.<br>
&quot;You always did look good in purples&quot; he remarked, without a smile.<br>
Beltane smiled nervously.<br>
&quot;Are you ready&quot;?<br>
Beltane nodded.<br>
Balastin sat down and opened his spell book, covered in dust, much like her trunk.  &quot;Here&quot; he pointed to a page and stood up &quot;Hold my hand now.&quot;<br>
He started to chant, his eyes flashed white as if the sun was beaming straight through them.  Beltane hated portals, she clenched his hand and in a split second, &quot;Welcome to the commons..&quot; Balastin snorted.<br>
&quot;Brell, I hate this place.&quot;  She scrunched up her nose.  &quot;It smells so foul here&quot;&gt;<br>
&quot;Beltane&quot; Balastin looked her in the eyes, she knew she was in for a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> talk</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, &quot;you know I hold you dear&quot; Beltane nodded, &quot;please take care of yourself.  They don't hold you as close as I do&quot;.  He let go of her hand, and was gone.<br>
Beltane stared at the place where Balastin once stood, realizing how alone she was.<br>
In her pocket was a gnomish gadget, the compass.  She flipped it open, turned to the right a little.  That way, she thought.  Ok, Xanta.  I'm coming.<br>

 &quot;I have the feeling that I have been in this place before...but not only here, many others as well. This place feels familliar. It would seem that I have come here often and travelled around this land you call Norath quite frequently.&quot;<br>
<br>
 He sighs deeply.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I see images and shadows of many, many people.&quot;, he shakes his head in wonder, &quot;They all liked me. . .all seemed to be seeking my assistance. I cannot fathom this, why would anyone need my help?&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;This Darkmask that belongs to you. . .he even has a painting that he's done of me. . .with some sword that I vaugely remember and this shabby armour that I am now wearing seemingly alive with it's own energy. What became of it. . .why is it as it is now?&quot;<br>
<br>
 He sighs again, shifting in the chair.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I feel as if I do not fit.&quot;<br>

&quot;Sometimes it is not as if we do not fit, it is that we do not fit the perceptions that we have placed upon ourselves. It's one of the best reasons to begin with where you are now, and while not forgetting what we learn, but instead incorporate it into what we become. Discover yourself every day anew,&quot; she said. &quot;I do not have all the answers, merely, a suggestion to live now, do not ask why, instead, ask, why not? There may be reasons for it, and perhaps you weren't divinity, but I tell you this,&quot; Here Xanta leaned close to Kesryn, reaching for his hand, gently, &quot;Whomever you have been matters not, but now, I offer you my friendship.&quot;<br>

The uncertainty was gone and she looked at the elf, who was shaking like a leaf under her gaze. <br>
<br>
Cooing softly, she murmured: &quot;You look so like you did that first day Kesryn, so frail and bewildered.. although now, you are in another form..You have been through so much, so many changes a shapeshifter in your own right, though it is not the life you chose for yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
She continued to hum softly, her fingers curled lightly around her staff..Slowly she drew the ring from it's pouch and held it in her open palm for Kesryn to examine, careful not to bring it too close as she saw the momentary panic flicker across his features.<br>
<br>
&quot;Calm now dear, I promise I shall not hurt you.. I never have and I am true to my word.&quot; <br>
<br>
Animaetrix gazed lightly at the sapphire that seemed to grow and flicker as the enchantments deep within its heart expanded to form a luminescent orb greater than the circumference of the stone. Images skittered back and forth within the the tiny world that it showed before it settled on one. The scene showed a small dragon, terribly cut and bruised, fighting desperately against a rope that cut deeply into his neck. A cloaked figure approached and freed the dragon, though it fought desperately until the bonds were loosed. Once free, it slumped over onto the ground and the figure whisked it away from the area.<br>
<br>
The scene darkened slightly and shifted, showing now a warm comfortable lair with a slightly less-bruised dragon guarding a tiny girl, who lay asleep at his feet. Clutched between his claws was a blue stone, and strewn about were other various graments of gems and metal.. bits of jewelcraft and stacks of books lined the walls of the lair.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you do not remember, as you did not remember then who you were.. when I found you.. and nursed you. I hope one day that you shall, for I did once love you Kesryn. Until then, know that you are safe here, and none of us would harm you. We all love you, and have missed you. Maybe.. one by one we can share our memories, and those in turn, will shed some light to you.&quot;<br>

Careful not to startle him, Ani nuzzled his hand lightly and moved back away, to give him time to digest.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ubeltanebuttercup.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beltane Buttercup</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://beltane.hypermart.net/pics/ezboardicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000000>(11/30/01 10:50:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=555.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Rematch</span><hr size=1> Beltane looks around, spinning herself slowly in a full circle.

 <br>
&quot;Dude, where did you get that armor!&quot; a wood elf asked excitedly behind her.  She spun around to meet him.  He looked at her with huge green eyes and a stupid, but curious look on his face.<br>
&quot;Greetings, young wood elf.  I got this fine armor..&quot; she was interupted.<br>
&quot;Sir, can you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  rez</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> my friend.  He died in the mountains of Lavastorm!&quot; a human monk was poking her in the back, beckoning her to come to Lavastorm.<br>
&quot;But I must away to a cabin close by and it is getting late, I cannot possibly go!&quot;  Beltane explained impatiently, spinning around to meet the monk.<br>
Just then shouts of seemingly thousands of pieces of armor began overwhelming her senses.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  500 platinum!<br>

<br>
Balastin where are you?  She looked at the ground and creased her forehead in grief.  Beltane thought to herself, I should have never come.  I could be at home, eating good food, polishing my gems, working on my newest invention!  She bolted.<br>
<br>
Running as fast as her little legs could take her she trotted off from all the noises.  She could see the house in the distance but her tiny legs could not carry her fast enough from the cries of people begging her services.  Behind her she could hear them, gaining on her.  She reached in her pocket and pulled out a small vial, stopping only quick enough to consume the contents and murmuring to herself, &quot;I hope there is not an expiration date on these&quot;.  A tingling sensation came over her, she looked down at her hand, she dropped the vial on the ground.  She was totally invisible now.  The crowd of beggars cries subsided, and she peacefully walked towards the house with Xanta in it.<br>
<br>
Closer examination of the small building made Beltane cringe in dissatisfaction.  The place was filthy!  What has Xanta reduced herself to?  Beltane giggled with delight at the idea of Xanta living with rats, sleeping on the floor.  The poor girl probably begs for food from the guards!  Beltane could not control her imagination!  Closer she crept to the house, to a window, she looked in the edge of the glass.  She spied Xanta.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Young clerics, mischievious to their elders.  One, two, three..

Two girls, giggling at their elders seemingly odd practices.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  The page belongs to me!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Beltane wasn't sure if she was going to start crying or if she was going to start laughing.  She slid her body down the side of the house, sitting away from it.<br>
<br>
Breathe, Beltane, breathe.<br>
<br>
She sat there for awhile before she felt her inivisbility wearing off.  &quot;Now or never&quot; she said softly as she got up.  Pulling her backback close to her she quietly walked around to the front door.  She stood there for a moment.  What should I say?  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Hi Xanta!  Remember me?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> No.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Hail, wench, serve me some ale!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  No.  I don't even like ale!  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Greetings Xanta!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Hmm, ok.  She opened the door meekly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gre...&quot; she stopped suddenly and stared around.  There was more than just Xanta looking right at her now.  She blinked.  She peeered around the room, only recognizing two people.  Had Xanta set up a rematch with spectators again?  Beltane glanced at Kesryn and sighed softly, even though he looked <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  different</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> somewhat, she knew who he was.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I see how it is Xanta!

Later we will have a rematch on that staring contest!&quot;<br>

She sees Beltane looking at her, a bit in disbelief, and Xanta says, &quot;It's quite nice!

I do wish he'd hurry, I haven't a clue what he's doing,&quot; Xanta says.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ehh, Kesryn, Kesryn... Might I suggest a room for yourself? I promised I'd find the keys so that the paladin might rest, perhaps it'd be good for you to as well? Either you have been enchanted, or, you are someone entirely different, or you have been so traumatized that you have forgotten. A good rest might do you well, bringing new light to the issue. But aside from that,&quot; she says, &quot;let me introduce one of my dearest friends, Beltane Buttercup! Beltane, meet ...Kesryn, least, I guess him to be Kesryn. Ani called him Kes, Darkmask called him Dragon Lord, and Ani called him again Kesryn, so even I am not sure who he is anymore,&quot; whispering this last part to Beltane.<br>

<br>
When I found you, the Gnomes had done horrible things to you, and your memory was scared, as it is now. I care for you, and watch out for you, as I always have. This sapphire was once your favorite trinket, and it keeps me close to you. I do not command what it shows, the things you saw are of our past...I often used to peer into it, to remember, and hope that it would help me find you. I have not stopped searching for you. I could never get it to do more than show history.. until today, when it began to glow again......&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes had a far off look in them, and she shook herself briskly. She must not let her mind get entangled in cobwebs of the past, any longer. Those times were gone, and now she had a very confused, very easily startled, Kesryn to contend with. <br>
<br>
&quot;So then..You were once a dragon. Mayhaps Xanta has the best idea.. sleep is good for all, especially with news like this to mull over.&quot;<br>
