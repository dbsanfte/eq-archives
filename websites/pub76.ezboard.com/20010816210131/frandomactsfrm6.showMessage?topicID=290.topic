My name is Miriel and I am a woodelf bard of 8 songs. Since most people I've met seems to be more interested in levelling than getting to know others, I decided to try and join a guild in hope to find people who are more social. I searched the web and found your guild. Reading the charter I realized that this was a guild where I didn't have to make an effort to fit in. I could just be myself.<br>
<br>
I remember how happy I was when someone helped me figure out things the first time I was online. If I could do that for someone else it would make me happy. Unfortunately I can't offer so much help that I would like, being a real newbie. (First time online about a month ago <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) It's also frustrating to be a bard and have great songs, but you can only buff the people in your group. But I do what I can.<br>
<br>
I have introduced myself to Cefias and Toggler at the FA camp so hopefully they will have some impression of me. I will try to introduce myself to some more of you on the upcomming events. That is if I can keep me awake. (My timezone is six hours ahead of east coast time.) The time I usually play is some where between 3 am and 15 pm east coast. <br>
<br>
It would be an honour to become a member of your guild, if you will have me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Safe travels Miriel<br>

Donnalinna so enjoys the arts, and is a well known patron of them.  Since she has had much sucess with sponsorship in the past, and if the Great Lady Meriel will accept, Donnalinna would be honored to be your sponsor.<br>
<br>
But remember this, Donnalinna is a most difficult Crown Princess to please.  You must pleadge that you will do all in your power to compplete the Geas that Donnalinna will grant to you.<br>
<br>
Oh... and should you find a Highman named Ptalaphose, keep an eye on him.  He's not as sturdy as he should be, and spends much of his time begin a bit on the timid side.<br>

<br>
Thank you for applying for membership of our guild and may I take this opportunity to wish you success in your application.  <br>

We have an application procedure that you will be required to complete in order to enter into full membership of the guild.  I have listed the steps below.<br>
<br>
1. Apply in this forum  ( check!)<br>
2. Read the Call and Charter.  <br>
The Call and Charter detail the principles that our guild are based upon and to proceed you should be in broad agreement with them.  You can find details of them at  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqrandomacts.com">www.eqrandomacts.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
3. Attend Random Acts Events<br>
There are three main reasons for this, it is fun, you get to meet lots of guild members and most importantly you will need to seek out a sponsor.<br>
Details of upcoming events can be found on this message board under ?Events, Hunting And Gathering?<br>
4. Find a Sponsor (Check !) <br>
A sponsor is a regular guild member that will mentor you through the fledgling quest and support you in your application.  It is also hoped that you will form a special relationship with your sponsor.  Your sponsor will also be responsible for you.  You can find who is on at any one time by typing the command &lt;/who all random&gt; <br>
(Note: Guild members can sponsor more than one fledgling.)<br>
5. Fledgling Quest<br>
Details of the quest can be found at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqrandomacts.com">www.eqrandomacts.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and don?t be afraid of asking your sponsor for assistance and advice.<br>
6. Guild Tagging <br>
Upon successful completion of your Quest you will receive your Random Acts Tag<br>
7. Probationary Membership<br>
Probationary Membership last for a period of two weeks and barring any difficulties you will be accepted into the guild as a full member<br>
<br>
The road is long Fledgling, but you will find assistance, advice and kindness upon the way.  <br>
<br>
If you have any difficulties you may contact me at <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: Meriel94@home.com"> Meriel94@home.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--> or the council at <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: eqrandomacts@hotmail.com"> eqrandomacts@hotmail.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--><br>
<br>
Be proactive and seek out guild members near you both in Norrath and here upon the boards.  <br>
<br>
For  our records it would be helpful if you could provide us with details of your name, class, race, level, playing times, and e-mail address if you have not yet done so. <br>
<br>

This was much harder than I thought. I've spent three hours in West Freeport and this is what I accomplished.<br>
<br>
My first victim was a lvl 2 warrior, Dalizar, who I helped to free from the evil cactus and the evil wall who was set on keeping him trapped. Then I tried to share my knowledge for an hour. No questions and hardle any replies. Maybe I was too enthustiastic and drowned him in information and questions about if he know about this and that. I also gave him some food and drink witch he asked for. Anyhow he suddenly shouted for tp to Queynos and I asked him a couple of times if he still was interested and it seems that he wasn't at the moment anyway. <br>
<br>
Second to go a lvl 1 sk, Cerris,  who also had a lvl5 bard. She was interested in getting help, but before I had a chance to get started she ran off. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Then I went for a corpse run to WC with Maldatina, a lvl 4 magician. At least that went well and she was greatful.<br>
<br>
It was hard to find real newbies and unfortunately it may take a while before I can give it a go again since I'm of for one and a half week to celebrate Midsummer. Since my future parents in law only have a phone modem I don't thik it would be popular if I spent hours on line <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I can so understand your frustration!  It took me nearly a week of prowling around the North Qeynos gate area to find a true newbie.  Mind you, up until the time when I was actively searching for a newbie in order to complete this quest, I had NEVER encountered problems locating them.  Now, however, when I truly needed one, there were none to be found.  Ahhhh, such is life <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> !<br>
<br>
My very first one scooted within a half hour.  Logged (claiming that there were kiddies that needed to be fed), and I never, ever saw her again.  My next several newbies were obviously alts (as evidenced by the questions they asked -- there was no way true newbies would have asked such things) and begger alts at that.  Ugh.  Another made no pretense about what he was (first question after I introduced myself was &quot;So, what do you have to give me?&quot; -- how bold!).  I played innocent and naive, offered to show him how to hunt and to accompany him and protect him; he got indignant and bolted.<br>
<br>
Finally, I found my true newbie, a level 2 mage <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I spent about an hour with him.  He learned quickly and was very enthusiastic and appreciative.  He logged and I thought I was on my way.  Unfortunately, I never heard from him again, either  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I was beginning to think the whole exercise was futile, and quite frankly, was about ready to give up.<br>
<br>
The next day, I met a new lowbie (level 5), and began the process all over again.  Again, it was a wonderful relationship -- in addition to working with him on basic skills, I got to know a little about him and shared some of my experiences.  Very nice person.  I knew I was on my way, finally.<br>
<br>
Then, two days later, I received a /tell from someone I had never heard of.  It was my mage newbie, under a new name!  He had remembered my name (and how I had taught him to look for people via the /friend and /who commands) and he found me!  We spent more time talking and going over the ways of life until he felt comfortable on his own.  <br>
<br>
I am pleased to announce that both these individuals have progressed well.  Very well, as a matter of fact!  We touch base periodically, and I have kept tabs on their progress.  Last time I checked, one was level 14, the other was 18!!!!!  I'm so proud!<br>
<br>
I say all this to say, keep at it, Miriel.  It will happen,  I promise.  You'll do fine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

Anyway, the quest may seem difficult, but I am certain you will do fine. And we don't want it to be too easy, because this is ment to sort out the ones that do not have the right mind for being an RAer. But I am sure you do and I am sure you will find your newbie, just keep looking. Often you find what you need when not searching for it activley.<br>

<br>
After bugging a few people I finally got hold of a real Newbie, Vique 2lvl cleric. After cheering a bit I discovered that she had a friend of lvl 60-ish who already had shown her most of what I know. Doh!!!<br>
<br>
Back to pestering people again. After some time I found a real newbie again! Shir lvl 1 wiz. She wanted to learn the game by herself and did not want my help. <br>
<br>
So on to the next one, Talouse lvl 2 wiz, who also had a lvl 5 char. Nope, no desire for help ther either. At this time I seriously began to wonder what was wrong. Did I have bad breath? Had I forgotten my deodorant? Or maybe I wasn't heroic enough?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                 <br>
<br>
After a zillion &quot; Excuse me, may I ask if this is your first character?&quot; (which I btw now can write with my eyes closed) I found HIM!!! A nice, lost lvl 1 En by the name Slfum who responded with &quot;help me&quot;. What a joy!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I taught Slfum (try to pronounce that name<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) about skills, the chatbar, the mail quests, websites,the everqust log on the computer and some other stuff. At that time he had to camp since he was falling asleep over the keyboard. It was afternoon here but he was in Korea 8 hours ahead of me. We put each other on the friends list and I intend to check back on him and tell him a thing or two that I forgot about.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is that when I was helping Slfum in say mode someone else should up and wanted to learn the friendslist and how to yell for help. And that someone had earlier declined my help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Of course I showed her too.<br>
<br>
When Slfum had logged I ran into a lvl 5 pally, Lampl, amd had the pleasure of teaching him how to do quests. About time someone told him. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So now I'm wondering if someone could give me a hint if this seem to be enough or if I should track down anotherone. I would ask Kelwan, but he's on a long vacation away from computers. So I would really appreciate a hint. <br>
<br>
And thank you Emerest, Kelwan and Numtini for your encouraging support.<br>
<br>
Safe travels<br>

That's way more newbies than I went through!  I would think that would be sufficient.  I'm sure you'll probably keep answering people's questions as they have them, but I don't think you need to keep looking for them.  <br>

If you all agree on that I have fullfilled my fledling quest, is there anyway that I could be tagged on next FA camp? The reason for this requst is that my sponsor Kelwan will be on vacation in Scotland for one more week, and then he's heading out to his summerhouse for the rest of July. I'm not sure that he will be able to check his e-mail or this board until August. I'm really looking forward to joining you and finally be apart of the guildchat, it would really be frustrating to have to wait until August. But if that is what you decide I will accept it and patiently wait until Kelwan gives me his approval.<br>
<br>
And yes, I still get tells from the newbies asking for advice. This quest was even more rewarding then I thought. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I intend to keep in touch with them and keep on helping them out. You can never have too many friends. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I spoke with Miriel this morning, and told her I'd be honored to stand with her in Kel's place (assuming he won't be able to attend) when she gets tagged this weekend.  Just let me know when the tagging will occur, and I'll be there to support her  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> !<br>
