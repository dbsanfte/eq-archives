Do forgive Donnalinna diary.  She is feeling most silly and childish today.  Most uncharacteristic for someone of my refined dignity and decour.<br>
<br>
He said I was pretty... and he brought for me a lovely shawl to keep me warm with, with the approaching winter.  It's so soft diary, I don't think I've ever felt anything so soft before.  I can't help but fidget with it, and think of Tala.<br>
<br>
And he took me on a date, diary!  Not some formal event with courtiers and musicians, but just to places where peasants and Freemen go to relax.  It was so different!  Well... we didn't really do anything.  It was more he had errands to run, and I asked if I could come along to keep him company.  So we traveled to various holy-shrines of the Treewardens, to find where he could learn and focus his new powers.<br>
<br>
But it was just the two of us.  Just us, Diary!  We traveled together without anyone else.  Just us!  No servants, no attendants, no politicians... just the two of us traveling around Norrath.  <br>
<br>
How magical he looked.  With the sun shinning off his darkened skin.  His every stride full of grace, form, and strength. With that impish smile of his, that hints at mischeviousness.  And his eyes diary.  Eyes so enchanting that if he were to ask me something and look at me, I wouldn't be able to say no.<br>
<br>
AND I KISSED HIM!<br>
<br>
Well... I'm sure he has been kissed before... and I lost my courage, so I only kissed him on the cheek.  AUUGGGGHH!  Stupid, Stupid, Stupid Donnalinna!  What a baffon I was.  Why couldn't I just up and kiss him.  I must look like such a flighty bird to him... Here he is all worldly... all noble... all wise and compassionate, and full of life.  And, I tag along like a little puppy.  Not to mention I can't even seem to form a sentance when he's around... he's probably just being kind to me, so that I won't get upset or sad.  But... but I don't want to be some hussy trollop that up and kissess him so soon.  I am a Lady, and a properly brought up one at that.<br>
<br>
...still... I bet he laughed at my pathetic kiss...<br>
<br>
...i'm a big, stupid, fool... Talasithar couldn't love me... he's so wonderful, and Donnalinna is always spoiled, and brash, and vain, and mean... i... I gave a flower to him... but... what if he doesn't like it Diary?  What if he just thinks it's a common flower... or just common... I'm sure he's seen millions of flowers, and rainbows, and waterfalls... much more pretty for this common flower... much more pretty than I am.<br>
<br>
but... but he said I was pretty.  I'm not pretty.  Miriel... Mereil... Raeann... Destinae... Emerest... Bronnwynn... Yassandra... Shurki... Whissers... Avihenda... Alluramar... Pikaa... Kyrstellaine.  They're beautiful.  Graceful... elegant... charming... charismatic...  Even sometimes-fussy Ailu is.  All things Donnalinna is not. <br>
<br>
Oh, I'm just a big, gangly, fool to think someone as wonderful as Talasithar would even think twice about Donnalinna... he said the shawl was old anyway... he really didn't... he just wanted me to have it, so it wouldn't go to waist.  He... he didn't really mean anything by it... and he always shows up, and then zips off again.  He... he never said even two words to me before.<br>
<br>
...i... i shouldn't put hope where there is none.  Tala... Talasithar sees me as nothing more than a young regent.  He... he'll never see me as... as I am.  ...mother never said I was pretty... and Tala is too kind to tell me that I'm not... and he always runs off after a few moments with me... he must think I'm his little sister... But... but he pulls at my heart so, Diary.  Yet, yet a Princess is not to show emotion.  She is to be neutral with her demeanor, so as not to let emotions cloud her judgement.  She is to have mercy and compassion, when it is called for, but she is not to show the emotions of her heart in the open, where ambitious men and women could use them against her.  ...but... but Tala... he so twiddles and befogs my mind that... that I can't help but act flighty around him.<br>
<br>
You know, Diary... sometimes I think I should give up my throne to be with him.  But... but I don't want Mother to be upset with me.  And... and I don't know if she would have approved of Tala... and if I do not rule, how will I ever see Mother again?<br>
<br>
What am I to do?<br>
<br>
Maybe I should ask Gwion or Bronnwynn what to do.  They always seem to have men fawing over them... maybe they could see what's going on, and help me.  They'd probably say I was just being a big wool-brained, silly, idiot.  First Sister Avihenda certainly does.  They know Tala a lot better than Donnalinna does.  they're his friends.  They'd know his heart.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry diary.  I... I don't mean to cry again on your pages again.  I'm sorry.<br>

Donnalinna is unsure if you know this or not, but she has about 8 or so journal entries on RA that aren't on eqcastors.  So... if you'd like to read even more back-story, or get more of Donnalinna's overall personality, feel free to read them.<br>
<br>
She is greatly humbled that you both find her words so moving.  My skill with a quill is not that great, and such words of encouragement are a honor, for one with so little skill.<br>
