He eyed the young ones who had gathered here for the telling of their history.  He looked at the clashing colors of their bright scales with no small amount of jealousy.  His scales had dulled almost to the point of being colorless.<br>
<br>
Finally they all settled down and turned their attention to the old one.<br>
<br>
Without preamble he began.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the beginning there were two.  They were all that were.  One sought to bring order to the universe and was called Law.  The other sought to destroy what was made and was called Chaos.  Their conflict ebbed and flowed for more time than even the gods could fathom.  Finally the one who sought order made a plan.  He would put shape and structure to his realm while trapping the one who sowed chaos.  <br>
<br>
The plan almost worked.  Law released his essence into the universe and from this sprang the elder gods.  At the same time he sprung his trap on Chaos to lock him away from Law's creation.  Chaos was caught in the trap but before it could fully imprison him he too released his essence into the universe.  This spread the seeds of change and destruction among the newly born gods.<br>
<br>
Law and Chaos still exist.  Chaos is locked in his prison and Law is the key.  The Elder Gods gave onto Vesheen the task of guarding The Key.  They knew if Chaos was to escape then the war would begin again and it would destroy all that was.  Vesheen in turn placed us, her brood on this small world and gave us The Key to guard.  We must remain always alert.  The prison is imperfect and Chaos can still influence the world with the echo of change.  It was his doing that caused the other Gods to bring the others here.  We must now not only guard The Key but fight the other races.<br>
<br>
That is why we are here and you must never forget your this most important duty.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that the old one ceased to speak and his young students quietly slithered out of the chamber.  Once all were gone, a slightly older wyrm entered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive me old one but we need you to come to the Sanctum at once.&quot;<br>
<br>
Very little could stir the old dragon to action but anything to do with the Sanctum was one of them.  Outrunning the younger dragon easily, the old one entered the Sanctum to see two acolytes staring at the large irregular crystal that floated and spun in the middle of the room.  this was The Key.  Upon moving closer he saw what had triggered the urgent summons.   Deep inside, barely perceptible by anyone other than a dragon, was a tiny crack.<br>
<br>
He felt a strange sensation and he could not remember what it was.  Then he realized.  It had been eons since he had felt it.  He was afraid.  He was afraid down to the core of his soul.  And worse, he had no idea what to do. <p><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Warenherz</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Ranger of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>The Eternal Conclave</font></b><br><img src=http://home.att.net/~h.e.williamson/source/tiger_run_md_clr.gif>

He had been living here alone for months.  Here in the Frontier Mountains he had found the solitude he needed right now along with the challenge of the extremely hostile inhabitants to vent his rage on.  <br>
<br>
He had left the Missed Note with barely a word,  only a note expressing his regret to Sasi.  It was there that the closest thing to friends he had were but he could not explain his reasons even to them.  He wouldn’t even know where to start.  He had felt the loss of control building for years.  He could not allow himself to get involved any deeper in any “causes” or “crusades”.<br>
<br>
Now as to the intruder.   Obviously it was not a giant, he had chosen this shallow cave specifically because it was at the head of a very narrow ravine.  The Mountain Giants could not even approach his home.  The goblins, sarnaks and others, while quick to attack him if they caught him out and about, never tried to track down his den.  When he cautiously opened the door and a almost forgotten aroma met his nostrils he relaxed.  It had taken longer that expected but his oldest friend had found him again.<br>
<br>
‘You know it can be dangerous to enter a man’s home uninvited around these parts.”  he said as he nonchalantly walked in.<br>
<br>
“Hmph...  that is the pot calling the kettle black.”  His guest retorted, though Radgen did not know why he would say that.<br>
<br>
Quickly dressing the rabbit he had snared Radgen continued. “Well old man, I expected you so show up sooner,  I’ve been in this world for years already.”<br>
<br>
 He heard his guest shift in his chair before the “Old man” responded.  “True, I fully expected you to already be at the head of some great army, with half the world under your thumb and the other half tottering on the edge.”<br>
<br>
That barb hit a little to close to home.  He knew better than anyone his unfortunate tendency to destroy everything around him.  “I am tired old man.  All I want to do is live a quiet life and pray that the next time I die, it is the last time.  No more new worlds, no more wars, no more crusades.”<br>
<br>
When Radgen looked up from his tasks he saw the old man staring at him.  His eyes were filled with profound sorrow.  “This isn’t the last world is it old man?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“No it isn’t.,  Before you ask how I know, get us a drink.  We will need it.”<br>
<br>
<br>

Come on, sweetie.... let's have the &quot;rest of the story&quot; <p><center><font size=5 font color="FF0000"><i>~~Sasi~~</i></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uradgen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Radgen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Reluctant Heart</span><br> <font color=#000000>(5/16/01 12:38:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=517.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.att.net/~h.e.williamson/source/Radgen2.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Friends</span><hr size=1> The two of them just sat there for a long time, nursing a bottle of Tumpy Tonic.  When the bottle was nearly finished the Old man looked up at Radgen and broke the silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the world I am from I am well known and held in great respect and/or fear.  So much so that all any one has to do is mention &quot;The Wizard&quot;, The Sorcerer&quot; or 'The Old Man&quot; and everyone knows who they are talking about.  I am just a man but I have found myself with a great talent for meddling. <br>
<br>
Not everyone appreciates my ummm... efforts.  I live alone in an isolated tower in the wilderness, nothing but a small hamlet nearby.  My defenses are formidable.  They have to be.  There are beings whose power rivals the gods, who have reason to dislike me.  <br>
<br>
So it is needless to say I was taken aback when one day you waltzed right into my study without warning, plopped yourself down on a stool and propped your feet up on my desk.'<br>
<br>
Radgen opened his mouth to interrupt but the Old Man held up a hand to stop him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now I know you don't remember this.  It is because for you, it has not happened yet.  You figured out that your curse was sending you to one world after another but I don't think you realized that you are also jumping around in time.  The first time you met me was back before you were cursed, but the first time I met you on the other hand, has not happened for you yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Old Man let that sink in a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now I did not try to blast you out of that stool you had so nonchalantly sat in cause you had immediately got my curiosity going.  I now realize that was exactly what you were trying to do.  For the next hour you vaguely referred to our friendship, though I knew nothing of it at the time, you seemed to be saying you simply stopped in to see an old friend.  Shortly there after you left.<br>
<br>
Obviously I dropped everything else I had been working on.  I had to find out who and what you were.  At first my confusion simply grew.  All I could find out was that you were a mercenary captain, A very good and honorable one but nothing really special.  Finally a powerful divination spell I cast revealed your curse and the general nature of it.  Painstakingly I tracked down all the worlds and times you had been, till I found the &quot;start&quot;.  I determined to travel to as many of these times and places to get to know you, to try and fathom what you were up to.  The rest is history so to speak.  I have gotten to know you and like you said that first day, we have become friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
After the Old Man had stopped for a bit Radgen spoke up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok I always knew that there was a reason you seemed to be tagging along on my enforced journey, now tell me, did you lean what you wanted?&quot;<br>
<br>
Again the sadness showed clearly in the Old Man's eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I have.  In some ways you are exceedingly normal.  You are not an angel and you are not a devil.  But I have seen you take actions that would make a devil think twice and an angel wonder at the depth of your generosity and selflessness.  You are walking proof that every man has the potential to be a monster or a saint.  You have been both.  <br>
<br>
This is not much for concern except that you are a naturally talented tactician, both politically and militarily.  Add to that literally centuries of experience and a drive to change the world around you and it makes you one of the most dangerous beings I have ever met.  <br>
<br>
I now realize that your visit to me so long ago was calculated to get me out of the way for a bit.  I am hopping times here but a little time will pass on my home world before I can return.  You have something planned and you know that whatever it is, I will oppose it.  Like I said we are friends and I think that was your way of avoiding yet again being on the other side of a battlefield from another person you care about.<br>
<br>
Yes I now realize I was being manipulated but I also know there was no malice in it.  Besides I am in no position to complain about manipulating people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now the Old Man turned a deep stare on Radgen and finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;My only concern now is, I don't know who it was who showed up in my study.  Radgen the monster or Radgen the saint?&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Radgen got up pulled 3 more bottle down off the self.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know about you Old Man but I feel the need to get very drunk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Holding out his glass for a refill, the Old man replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;I completely agree.&quot; <p><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Warenherz</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Ranger of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Diamond Circle</font></b><br><img src=http://home.att.net/~h.e.williamson/source/tiger_run_md_clr.gif>
