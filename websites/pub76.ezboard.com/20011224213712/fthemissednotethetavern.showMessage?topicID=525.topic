There was a tension between the sisters that made the silence of the household crackle. Late at night the halfling picked up the muffled sounds of whispered arguments from the outer room. On more than one occaision the still of the night was snapped with the slamming of a door and the rapid clop of feet outside the house.<br>
<br>
She saw little of the elves who cared for her, both the druidess and the dark-tressed one with sad eyes tended her wounds when she slept. The constant crash of dreams and visions of the past made it hard to tell when she was awake.<br>
<br>
In one dream she reached Misolyskul, bound to his pillar. Her deft fingers played at the lock of the shackles around his wrists, at length springing one open. The shackle clattered to the ground and he was gone, only a wisp of fog curling lazily along the ground where he stood. Atop the piller a crow inclined its head to gaze at her.<br>
<br>
Still, despite the dreams and the friction of the house, the priestess did recover her strength. She learned the names of her hosts. The sisters were Fier'Dal of house Galliarde, the druidess Afton and her sister Arsiana. The halfling was surprised to learn that she was not in the lofty Kelethin but rather in a wood-elf enclave within the walls of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
Then one night, just as dusk was falling, a visitor came to the house. A tall elf clad in green and gold plate, with eyes full of fire... <p><a href="http://home.sc.rr.com/thistleburr/thistle_art.jpg"><b>Thistleburr</b></a>, High Priestess of Bristlebane<BR><a href="http://www.the-elitists.com"><i>The Elitists</i></a>, Tribunal Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthistleburrsoulbalm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thistleburr Soulbalm</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.liquidesign.com/jv/images/albrecht_10.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Halfling Healer</span><br> <font color=#000000>(3/28/01 4:55:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=525.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.sc.rr.com/thistleburr/images/thistle_art_tiny.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A visitor comes</span><hr size=1> Afton stood before the man in the doorway, blocking his entrance to the house. She took a determined stance, one hand on her hip and the other outstretched, waving him away and arguing with him in hushed voice. Thistleburr was not familiar with many elvish customs but she could clearly see this was a rude reception. She rose from cushioned bench that served her as a seat and moved closer to see what was the matter.<br>
<br>
'... care if Tearis himself sent you! I will not allow this house to be further defiled by slaves of the wurm! She should not have come back as is, now more of you come? Whose blood do you seek now?' The halfling crept into the edge of her vision and the druidess faltered, thinking it her sister coming to the door.<br>
<br>
The man replied in a composed voice, unruffled by this hostile reception. His accent was most decidedly not one of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
'I do not wisshh harm upon thiss housse. My wordss are for the Claw and not a naturewalker. If I musst ssee her elssewhere, ssend her out to me...' His gaze was deep and alluring, as if banked fires danced within his eyes. His armor was cunningly fashioned of finely meshed overlapping plates, green tinged with gold. It fit him like a second skin.<br>
<br>
The druidess turned her head to call for her sister but did not move from the doorway she guarded. 'Arsiana, you have a visitor waiting outside.'<br>
<br>
The man inclined his head slowly, taking note of the blonde halfling standing behind the druidess. She was looking at him with wide childish eyes that wavered and darted as if seeing ghosts. He offered a smile intended to look friendly.<br>
<br>
'Greetingss little one. Are you travelling with the Sscaled Claw?'<br>
<br>
At those words the halfling startled and stepped back into darkness. Her heart was pounding and the visions calmed for a moment as the questions raced through her mind. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Who is this man? How does he know about the Scaled Claw? Is this another test from the Lord of Fortune?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The bard Arsiana came to the door and placed her hand on her sister's shoulder. She smiled tightly when she saw the visitor, extending more courtesy than the druid had done. Her voice conveyed a cheerfulness born of the performing stage.<br>
<br>
'Hail and well met, Lord Kesryn. Many seasons have passed since we last spoke. Shall we walk along the lakeside and catch up on matters of interest?' <p><a href="http://home.sc.rr.com/thistleburr/thistle_art.jpg"><b>Thistleburr</b></a>, High Priestess of Bristlebane<BR><a href="http://www.the-elitists.com"><i>The Elitists</i></a>, Tribunal Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthistleburrsoulbalm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thistleburr Soulbalm</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.liquidesign.com/jv/images/albrecht_10.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Halfling Healer</span><br> <font color=#000000>(4/2/01 3:19:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=525.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.sc.rr.com/thistleburr/images/thistle_art_tiny.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A visitor comes</span><hr size=1> Afton sat brooding at the table. She had a book open in front of her, colorful precise renderings of ferns and leaves surrounded with elvish script. Yet Thistleburr could tell she was not reading it. At length she closed the book and went over to the window, looking out at the empty streets of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
'Who was that man, Afton?' the halfling asked.<br>
<br>
The druidess turned to face Thistleburr, lips tightly pursed. 'He is an ambassador to the court of King Thex. Claims to be a dragon in the form of a man.'<br>
<br>
'Why is he then not welcome in your home? You would bar a member of the court?'<br>
<br>
With a snort and a shake of her head the elf dismissed this. 'He is a fraud and a perversion. Wears the garb of a defender of the faith, yet rejects Tunare the Mother. The last thing this house needs in it is another heretic fanatic of the Wurmqueen.'<br>
<br>
Thistleburr drew back slightly at the sharp tone of <i>heretic</i>. The memories of her banishment still stung. She decided to move the topic.<br>
<br>
'He made mention of the Scaled Claw. Have you heard of this person?'<br>
<br>
Afton's fair skin reddened, thinking the halfling mocked her. Seeing genuine innocence in her eyes, she soon began to laugh instead.<br>
<br>
'You do not know? Not a day goes by some busybody is not upbraiding me about it...' The druidess sat at the table again, eye level with the halfling. 'The Scaled Claw is my sister, Arsiana.' <p><a href="http://home.sc.rr.com/thistleburr/thistle_art.jpg"><b>Thistleburr</b></a>, High Priestess of Bristlebane<BR><a href="http://www.the-elitists.com"><i>The Elitists</i></a>, Tribunal Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarsiana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arsiana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Storyteller</span><br> <font color=#000000>(4/2/01 9:21:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=525.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://216.102.157.49/class/arsiana1color.jpg height=150, width = 100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A visitor comes</span><hr size=1> The candlelight flickered in low Spring breeze wafting through the loft bedroom as the purple dusk slowly transcended into evening.  She had opened the window to catch the heady odor of hyacinths on the wind.  These times alone, savoring the solitude, were the only times that served to comfort her during this difficult sojourn in the city of her birth.  Still unable to gather her thoughts around the voiceless question that asked her why she had returned in the first place, Arsiana chose to spend time alone, writing poetry, taking late midnight walks while the town slept and, during the day, tending the poor priestess of Rivervale who had been left to die out in the frozen wastes.<br>
<br>
The halfling had become her reason--her excuse--for staying, when her original plan had been to abide but a fortnight.  It had now been well over a month since her arrival.  The neighbors had warmed a little in their reception of her, yet she still had not had any invitations to visit or share a meal with any of her old friends. <br>
<br>
She helped with the cooking and tended the convelescent as needed.  Although he had nowhere near the healing powers or knowledge of her druidess sister, she had long since learned of the restorative and special regenerative powers that her music could produce.  So, every afternoon, as the sun hovered golden above Lake Elizerain, Arsiana would produce her lute and weave a song or story for the woman, who never seemed to be listening at all, but stared resolutely off into the middle distance, studying with large inquisitive eyes something only she could see.<br>
<br>
Arsiana had met many halflings in her travels and had known them to be jolly folk who loved to laugh and hear a funny tale and share a rumor or trick.  When the bard had followed the ways of the Lord of Fortune, she had taken great delight in her interactions with these people.  Since the Sacrifice, however, she had felt uneasy around them, almost as much an outsider to them as she was now in her own homeland.  She invariably sensed that they, too, felt uneasy around her.<br>
<br>
But this young woman was different from any halfling she had ever known.  During her time awake, she was quiet and studious.  And when Arsiana tended her in her sleep she seemed restive and tormented, thrashing about and muttering things in her native tongue, slurred and only half-understood by Arsiana, who spoke the language fluently.  The things Arsiana did hear, however, made her wonder.  The agitated convelescent called out to a person named Reynard, and whispered fearfully, fretfully about a black crow.   Other things were names or places she had never heard of …<I>Xev, Melva, Harte, Misolyskul, Sasi</I>.  There was no doubt that something terribly deep and mysterious troubled the small woman.<br>

She had hovered over the journal page, which taunted her with its stark blankness, as she tried to focus her thoughts around to her original project: a poem or song or some kind of story… but nothing produced itself.  She had almost been tempted to utter a prayer to the Great Bard himself for inspiration.  In her younger years that had always seemed to work...<br>
<br>
"Arsiana!" came the sharp call from below.  Afton… What was she about now?  Her tone was taut, angry.  It seemed as though her elder sister never addressed her but in this tone anymore.  As always, Arsiana felt her hackles rise, ready to do battle.  She moved to the edge of the loft and peered down the ladder.  "You have a visitor waiting outside," Afton finished coldly, only leaving the front door slightly ajar and taking a small step backward from it.   <br>
<br>
Arsiana pondered her sister for a moment.  A visitor waiting outside?  But whom would Afton receive so rudely?  Certainly not one of their neighbors or friends--as if any of them would pay her a visit!<br>
<br>
Quickly Arsiana leapt from the loft and landed on the floor softly without touching the ladder--a trick she had learned in childhood. In passing, she noticed the halfling priestess standing in the corner of the front room.  <I>Good, she is on her feet, at least,</I> Arsiana thought.  The diminutive woman stared intensely, nervously, in the direction of the door.  Her mouth moved in inaudible whisper--perhaps uttering prayers.  Something had most definitely startled or frightened her.<br>
<br>
Afton stood before the semi-closed door, staring at it as if she expected it to burst into flames instantly.  Arsiana moved past her sister, placing a hand on her shoulder.  She was surprised by the tension she felt in the druidess.  The bard moved into the line of sight of the doorway and instantly masked her surprise.  <br>
<br>
A tall high-elvish man with a silvery mane and dark, intense stare stood on the front step.  His green and gold armor gleamed in the lamplight.  His face alighted with recognition and Arsiana felt as if a weight had dropped into her stomach.  Kesryn!  But why now?  Why had he come here?  Arsiana quickly effected a stage smile, schooled her features to somehow make up for her sister's rude reception.  She opened the door wider, feeling Afton move away from her with an almost inaudible sigh of disgust.  <br>
<br>
"Hail and well met, Lord Kesryn. Many seasons have passed since we last spoke. Shall we walk along the lakeside and catch up on matters of interest?"<br>
<br>
Quickly Arsi shut the door behind her, leaving the stoop of the cottage with a purposeful stride.  Her smile set firmly in place, she motioned for Kesryn to move towards the lakeshore with her.  They followed a dimly-lit path that was sparsely populated… nevertheless, those who passed them--rushing to their homes to take their evening meal--did not bother to disguise their own stares of curiosity and sometimes even of disgust.  Kesryn was most definitely recognized, as a member of the King's court.  The nods and half bows were meant as a mere courtesy to him, though Arsi knew well what they were thinking as they passed the two of them walking together.  <I>The dragon brood…they come together to commune and share some plot or conspiracy from their Wyrm Queen.</I>  Arsi had half the mind to glare at them and lick her lips hungrily as she studied their children.  She smothered a giggle at the thought.<br>
<br>
The two did not speak until they reached the lakeside.  The shore was deserted and although Norrath's great moon was only at a sliver, the reflection of the brilliant canopy of stars shimmered in the lake, illuminating adequately their interaction.  They were, after all, elves… or at least bore the form of elves.  They were comfortable facing each other in low light.<br>
<br>
Arsi turned to Kesryn, clasping her hands before her in the traditional greeting.  "May the gentle wind ever ease your flight, Good Kesryn, and may all your treasures be bountiful,"  she greeted him according to tradition in the deep-throated language of the dragons.<br>
<br>
Kesryn smiled at hearing his native tongue spoken to him.  He clasped his hands in a similar gesture and bowed shortly.  "Good and Gentle Winds to you, Scaled Claw."<br>

Despite the lateness of the hour the halfling felt no urge to sleep. She awaited the return of Arsiana, eager to advance her quest.<br>
<br>
Thistleburr had asked Afton questions about her sister, receiveing curt replies and little insight. Whatever past stood between the elves was bitter, and deep. She stopped prying.<br>
<br>
Sitting on the bench by the window Thistleburr watched the moonlight cast shadows in the streets. People walked past, some vanishing into wisps of fog that rose from Lake Elizerain. She knew not all the people she saw were really there, Sasi was not really walking along these elven streets. Misolyskul sent her visions constantly now and waking and sleeping had little boundaries for her dreams.<br>
<br>
To have awoken here, in the house of the Scaled Claw, was a sign from Bristlebane. Yet she had wasted weeks, weeks! Surely the Lord of Fortune was laughing at his servant. She would delay no longer.<br>
<br>
And to have the ambassador of the Ring of Scale come here surely could not be coincidence. Had the dragons somehow learned of her task? Would she to be chained up in a pit moated by lava, as was the Composer of Dreams?<br>
<br>
Would the Scaled Claw betray her plan to the dragons?<br>
<br>
Thistleburr shook such notions from her head. Arsiana knew nothing to betray, for she had told her nothing. Yet now she would need to confide in her, to win her back to the service of the Lord of Fortune. This Kesryn had come too early to learn anything.<br>
<br>
The light of the candle flared then died as it spent. She sat in darkness, wrapped in the cool night air, awaiting the return of Arsiana. <p><a href="http://home.sc.rr.com/thistleburr/thistle_art.jpg"><b>Thistleburr</b></a>, High Priestess of Bristlebane<BR><a href="http://www.the-elitists.com"><i>The Elitists</i></a>, Tribunal Server</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showMessage?topicID=535.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showMessage?topicID=533.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=525.topic&index=5><img src=http://turkkurt.homestead.com/files/z/Sasi/brmreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.threadControl?topicID=525.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=525.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=525.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themissednotethetavern">The Tavern<option value="themissednotethestage">The Stage<option value="themissednotetidbits">Tidbits<option value="themissednotetantrums">Tantrums  <option value="themissednotefrm11">Just for fun!<option value="themissednoteguildlinks">Links<option value="themissednotethepartyforum">The Party Forum<option value="themissednotetradesevents">Trades & Events<option value="themissednotetesting">Testing<option value="themissednotefrm12">Ghost thread</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
