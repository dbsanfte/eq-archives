<br>
**********<br>
<br>
Well, Diary here I am again.  It's very difficult for my tired heart as of late.  I have returned home to Felwithe, so as to renew my ties with the All-Mother, and make myself an initate of the cult.  And, while Yeolarn Bronzeleaf regards me amiably, Donnalinna gets the impression that... that she is still unwelcome in Felwithe.  As if she has done some shameful act to bring great disgrace upon the Holy City of Tunare.<br>
<br>
I... I keep delaying my promise to Mother to come home and be the Princess that I should.  She'd... she'd still be disappointed with me, like she always was.  I've never been able to make her happy.  I... I did everything that I could to try to get her to forgive me and love me.  I... I hoped that maybe if Mother saw me do the things she did, she'd... she'd see herself in me and... and give me a second chance.<br>
<br>
Mother... mother please... I'm... I'm sorry.  I... I don't know what to do anymore.  I'm... I'm so lost and confused.  I never did have much power and control of divination.  Maybe... maybe I interpreted what the All-Mother was saying wrong.  Maybe... Maybe I am to be pushed eternally for what I did to Mother and Father.  I was the one who went against Destiny.  I was the one who ruined what the Stars above fortold.  I... I was the one with the vainglorious pride to think that I am anything.<br>
<br>
But... but I cannot accept that Tunare would punish anyone so.  In my heart of hearts, I cannot accept Tunare being that crewl.  She is a Mother... and Mothers aren't suppossed to be that way.<br>
<br>
So... I perservere.  I spend time hunting elusive ghasts in the haunted forrest of Lesser Faydark, and dealing with the wretched monsters of Castle Mistmoore... but Donnalinna feels no more welcome in Felwithe.  Donnalinna feels no more welcome in a lot of places, Diary.  Donnalinna... I am an exile.  Home doesn't welcome me.  Mother doesn't welcome me.<br>
<br>
I... I haven't heard from Talasithar in a long time Diary.  Maybe... maybe he has forgotten me.  My... my only chance at sunlight during this Twilight.  I... I thought he liked me.  I... thought he wanted to be with me.  He let me hold his hand once... <br>
<br>
Diary... you're... you're all that I have left of my past.  A little blue, leather book, worn from age... and cover in the stains of my tears.  I... I treat you unfairly Diary.  I... I shouldn't burden you with all that I have been punished with.  Diaries are meant to record joyous encounters, frivoulus innanities, and times of child-like laughter.  Instead... instead wicked Donnalinna has forced you to suffer.  She's taken you hostage from Felwith, and scribbled her shameful words in you.  Please don't leave Diary.  Please... I... I could not stand the loneliness.<br>
<br>
If... If you were flesh Diary... you'd be whatever you wanted to be. I... I would only hope that you'd still... you'd still be Donnalinna's friend.<br>
<br>
I cannot, I will not belive that Talasithar is someone who'd play with the hearts and dreams of annother!  He... He would not do such a thing!  Talasithar is much to noble to do this to me!  He... he wouldn't mock my pain like this... he... he just wouldn't, would he diary?<br>
<br>
The Citizens of Highhold Keep have a very quaint saying.  A very dark, cynical saying that so fits Donnalinna's gloom, Diary.  &quot;Is it the light at the end of the tunnel... or the fire of the on-coming dragon.&quot;<br>
