I hope you all enjoy my quest.)<br><br>The Dream<br><br>     As I lay sleeping on the eve of my own retirement, my dreams of glory and conquest turned to dark clouds of grey and black.  My mind clouded over and I saw an image appear in the clouds.  It was a face.  A horrible, terrifying, disfigured face that I knew only too well.  It was the Dark Prince, Innoruuk.  A voice that could wither a garden of roses rang out through my mind.  <br>     &quot;My servant,&quot; said the awesome figure, &quot;you have served me well throughout your life on Norrath.  Now the time has come for you to join my legions in the afterlife.&quot;<br>     &quot;The afterlife?&quot; I said, somewhat puzzled by what he meant.  &quot;Am I going to die?&quot;<br>     &quot;Yes.&quot; replied the sinister voice of my dark master.<br>     &quot;How will I die?&quot;  I queried.  Not even sure if I was still in a dream state.  It all felt surreal, as if I was neither awake nor asleep anymore.  All sense of reality had been lost.  <br>     &quot;You will simply cease to live.  Your breath will quit at my behest.  I control every breath you take, and you are mine to do with as I see fit.  And I see fit to end your life one hour after your little 'Retirement Ceremony'.&quot;<br>     Suddenly, I felt a surge of rage swelling in me.  All that I had done on Norrath, all the creatures I had slain, all that fell before me in battle, all the quests I had accomplished, all the power I had attained, and all the life or death situations I had lived through were about to be rendered worthless.  Was my life really forfeit for Innoruuk?  Could he truly just end my life at a whim?  All my life I had devoted my life to the study of the black arts of Necromancy, and I had no wish to stop.  Not for anything, or anyone...not even my own Dark God.  &quot;Is there anything I can do to possibly change your mind?  I have no wish to die just yet.  There is still much left to be done on Norrath.&quot;<br>     &quot;The world as it stands now was not shaped by a single man.  Many have come before you and have passed on.  Others will come after you.  The fate of the world does not rest upon your small shoulders.  To be blunt, you're just not that important.&quot; was the reply of my master, much to my dismay.<br>     &quot;Surely if I am not important, then you should not care this much about my death&quot; I shouted.  The eyes of Innoruuk seemed to narrow, looking me over with a renewed scrutiny.  I could feel his gaze penetrating my very soul, and was chilled to the bone.  Never had I been so terrified by a single entity.  I began to ponder if what I had said was too much.  I certainly had no wish to anger my own deity.  Then Innoruuk spoke with a fearsome power that shook my very being.  I fell to my knees before his awesome presence, my heart filled with dread as the image of the Dark Lord began to grow to 50 times my size.<br>     &quot;Ghoulik Bloodmoon, dark Necromancer of Norrath, I will have your soul on the day of your retirement.  However, you have shown me that you are strong willed and determined to keep fighting in my name.  For this I shall offer you this opportunity:  after you have passed on to the afterlife, you will be allowed to speak to your friends in the mortal realm through their dreams.  If your friends can accomplish the tasks I set for them, they may be able to free your soul from my grasp so you may rest in peace.<br>     Did I really have a choice in the matter?  How could I possibly turn down the offer.  Anything was better than being tormented by my own deity for all eternity.  I rose to my feet and loudly proclaimed &quot;Yes!  I shall accept your offer, Great Prince of Hate Innoruuk.&quot;<br>     The shape of the dark God began to shrink, and with it my fears.  His face returned to the distant clouds and began to fade from view.  The clouds began to clear and I felt myself stirring into consciousness.  I awoke in the dead of night as a thunderstorm raged outside the small dwelling I had taken shelter in the day before.  I looked outside to see the rain pouring down and the lightning streak across the sky.  And I wondered aloud, &quot;Can anyone truly understand what it means to undertake this dark quest?  Could I convince my friends that it was a worthy cause?  And more importantly, could they survive long enough to complete it.&quot;  As I watched the storm rage on, a terrible thought entered my mind.  What if they won't accept the challenge?  This quest will not only test the strength and wisdom of my friends, but it would also test their loyalty.  I could only hope they can rise to the occasion and win this monumental battle for my soul. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uwhorlwinnd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whorl Winnd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b><font color=yellow>RA Council Member</font><br><font color=red>Monkey with a red dress on...<br> ROBE! it's a ROBE!</font><br><font color=blue>Administrator<b></span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/17/01 4:29:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghoulik's Quest:  Prologue</span><hr size=1> I accept! <p><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19091target="web"><font color=blue>Whorl Winnd</font></a><BR>54th Season Human Disciple<BR>Morell-Thule<BR>[Random Acts] of Kindness!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/brandomacts.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=donnalinna>Donnalinna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Member<b></span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/17/01 9:24:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghoulik's Quest:  Prologue</span><hr size=1> Though Donnalinna does not have any real friendship with you, Ter'Dal, she will not see you suffer.<br><br>If you would have my aid, Donnalinna will quest for you.<br><br>Donnalinna Swansbeauty<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/uneaoh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neaoh</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>RA Officer<br><font color=blue>Web Resources Coordinator</span><br>  Posts: 298<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/17/01 11:05:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/frandomactsfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghoulik's Quest:  Prologue</span><hr size=1> Neaoh still could not believe it.&quot; I knew Innoruuk was cruel but this goes to far&quot; he thought as he stared at the message sent to him earlyer.<br><br>Looking up from the message and looking around the great hall at all the things that had been placed there to help the family remember the ones who had passed on Neaoh started to become mad.
