Are we to scared to protect our families! Our homes, our lives, and our freedoms are slowly being sucked away from us, as Dracado’s undead menions and followers push forward. We can not sit here and let him take it away from us anymore. We must stand and fight!” shouted Master Dojaro. “For if we do not, we are doomed to a life of torment and hell!” The crowd began to chant ‘FREEDOM!’ Suddenly the black earth behind Dojaro began to crumble and a crevasse formed. Before Dojaro could be warned, a blood soaked skeleton arose from the ground. Dojaro spun around quickly in surprise. As if in slow motion the skeleton reached out and broke through the chest Dojaro. The skeleton quickly removed the still beating heart from the master. A shout came out from the crowd, “MASTER!”  The skeleton let out a blood chilling cackle and said, “Let this be a lesson to those that dare oppose Dracado. Hell will seem like heaven when he is through with you all!”<br><br>Mcbeth quickly sat up grabbing his chest as he breathed as if he had just had a battle. “Master…” cried Mcbeth. Mcbeth began to think to himself,  “…why won’t this dream stop coming!” Mcbeth laid back down and stared blankly at his ceiling.  The sun was now starting to rise and the warmth could be felt in his Freeport home.  The sweet smell of the flower shop down the road could already be smelt. The smell of the flowers reminded him of Andie. “I am going to be late! She is going to kill me!” Mcbeth said out loud as if someone would hear him.  Mcbeth quickly got dressed and grabbed his light burlap sack. Mcbeth ran to the flower shop and picked up a blue rose, it was her favorite.  Andie and Mcbeth were to meet for lunch.<br><br>“I can’t get that dream out of my head. It just won’t go away. It still haunts me this day, “ said Mcbeth. “I guess I can’t let his death go. I mean I stood there helpless. What could I do to save him. My master is now dead. I am a monk with no master.”<br><br>Sympathetically Andie says, “Why can’t you go to Paub and see if he will train you?”<br><br>“You don’t understand, every monk has a master. Once you no long have a master you become a master and train a young monk, or you are nothing at all. My training has not been finished, it can’t be finished,” Mcbeth said depressingly. “It’s not the same as it would be with you. If your trainer died you could always go to another trainer and start off where you left off. But with monks, a master is your one and only master. There will be no others.”<br><br>“What about Tao?”<br><br>“How do you know about Grandmaster Tao?” said Mcbeth curiously.<br><br>“Well, one of my former trainers, who taught me the arts of bandaging, learned from Tao himself. Why don’t you go to him and seek out how to get rid of the dream. Maybe he can train you!” said Andie excitedly.<br><br>“He would surely know what to do. But Andie, he would be almost 200 years old by now.  Also, no one knows of his where he lives. It was said that he moved up into some mountains to never be seen again.”<br><br>“Hey, it could happen. You hear all the time about how long monks live. You should know, Master Dojaro was reaching to be 110 years old. Besides, if I remember correctly, Sambo might still have a map to where Tao is. What’s the worst thing that could happen? If you don’t find him at least you can say you tried,” said Andie hoping to break through to Mcbeth.<br><br>“Okay, go ask Sambo.”<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A few hours later Andie ran through Mcbeth’s front door. “MCBETH, MCBETH, MCBETH!” Andie shouted. “Sambo had a map still, it’s old but it is still legible.” Mcbeth’s eyes widened in surprise. He quickly jumped up from meditation and ran over to Andie. He picked her up and spun her around.<br><br>“Okay, Okay, put me down your going to make me dizzy!” Andie screamed in laughter. “Here are some of my famous aloe bandages. Now get packing!”<br><br>Andie gave Mcbeth a big hug and left him to his packing. Mcbeth looked around trying to decide what to bring.  Mcbeth thought to himself, “Well I am a monk, what’s to decided on. I don’t carry much, let alone do I have a lot to choose from.”  He opened up his light burlap sack and began to fill it with food, water, his two Fighting Batons, his Sages Battle Staff, and a blanket to sleep on. “I better go see Paub before I go, they always like to know where we are going,” said Mcbeth out loud.<br><br>“Llao, have you seen Paub?”<br><br>“Yes he just got back from the market. He should be in the storage house putting away some of the herbs he just bought.”<br><br>“Thank!”<br>Mcbeth quickly spun around and rushed to the storage house. As he hurriedly ran into the room he blindly turned the corner and knocked down Paub.<br><br>“Paub I am so sorry!”<br><br>“It is quite fine, no harm done. What brings you to me in such a rush?”<br><br>“I have come to tell you that I am going on a journey.”<br><br>“What kind of journey?”<br><br>“As you know, I am still not sleeping well.  And it seems to be getting worse. Andie and I have been talking and it’s time to face my daemons.  She talked to one of her old trainers and found a map to somewhere close to the last known location of Grandmaster Tao.  I am going to find him and seek his knowledge.”<br><br>“Well of all the monks here, I had a feeling you would be the one to do so. So did your master, he too knew that one day you would go in search for him.  He will be very old by now but his wisdom will be greater then any you have ever seen. Do not be deceived by the eye Mcbeth.  Tao knows more then you can imagine,” said Tao with a grin on his face. “Come with me up stairs, I have something for you. Dojaro wanted you to have this when you were ready. You are your own master now, Mcbeth. Every master has something to be passed down to his student. Dojaro asked me to pass on to you this robe. The robe once represented one of the most mysterious bands of monks known to Norath. You are a very accomplished fighter and to you I present the robe of the lost circle. Wear it proud.”<br><br>“Thank you so much Paub! I have heard stories of the lost circle but I always thought they were just fairy tales.  Never the less, I will wear it with honor.”<br><br>“Mcbeth, before you go I have something of mine to give to you. I want you to have my Treant Fists.”<br><br>“Paub…  those should be given to your student.”<br><br>“Take them, you are more skilled then any of my students will be in a lifetime.”<br><br>“Thank you Paub! I will not let you down!” Mcbeth yelled as he ran out the door.<br><br>Mcbeth grabbed his pack and headed towards the east gates.  As he left the gates he slowly turned around and walked backwards so as to look at the great city as he left.<br><br>“I will be home again soon,” said Mcbeth quietly as to if whisper it.<br><br>And so the great search began for Tao. But unknown to Mcbeth his life was about to change forever.<br><br><br><br><br>Let me know what you think.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=547.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showNextMessage?topicID=547.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=547.topic><img src=http://ezsasi.homestead.com/files/page2Reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.threadControl?topicID=547.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=547.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=547.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub76.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themissednotefrm15">SEE the Missed Note<option value="themissednotethetavern">The Tavern<option value="themissednotethestage">The Stage<option value="themissednotetidbits">Tidbits<option value="themissednotetantrums">Tantrums  <option value="themissednotefrm11">Just for fun!<option value="themissednoteguildlinks">Links<option value="themissednotethepartyforum">The Party Forum<option value="themissednotetradesevents">Trades & Events<option value="themissednotetesting">Testing<option value="themissednotefrm12">Ghost thread</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthemissednote>The  Missed  Note</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethetavern>The Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
