-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
I woke up the next day with a very disaluted mind. I felt dizzy, disoriented, and very confused that i was alive. I sat up and looked around and the scenery almost immdediatly reminded me of my quest. But something was missing, Boebes!<br>
<br>
I looked and looked, and gave messages but she was no where to be found. I feared the worst that while i had my "accident" her soul was taken. I didnt know what to do, travel forth, travel back, DONT TRAVEL.<br>
<br>
I decided it would be for the best if i made the voyage. And prayed to the Tribunal that i would see Boebes yet once again on Norrath.<br>
<br>
Right before i left Gwion appeared at the edge of the forest where i was. She new of my trip and grieved for the loss of Boebes as well. But she knew i wasnt a very experienced traveler so she gave me a piece of paper. It had very detailed writen directions from Freeport to Qeynos. Though the Karana directions sometimes lacked in info, it was good enough and i thanked her.<br>
<br>
After she went her way a Barbarian Rogue by the name of Crytan of some sort showed up. I immediatle "hailed" him as he was running fast to the Kithicor Woods. After he stoped i said "Is ye to travel to Rivervale of the Halfilings?"<br>
<br>
He replied immediatly in a strong voice "Aye lad, i am..."<br>
<br>
With joyous feelings i said "Safety in numbers laddy, let us travel these woods t'gether!"<br>
<br>
He agreed and we grouped immediatly and set for the woods not 20 feet away.<br>
<br>
When we got into the Forest it was dark, creepy, and just not a place for anyone of our experience. But we pushed on and got as high on the Right hill hoping not to meet a "werewolf" in here or one of those "Decaying Commanders."<br>
<br>
It was a straight travel. We just ran, no talking at all just observations of everythin around us looking for the smalest movement, listening for the faintest sound, and smelling for the foulest smell of decaying skeleton.<br>
<br>
After about 5 minutes of pure senses we reached the rock face which had the tunnel to Rivervale in its belly. But there was something in the tunnel!<br>
<br>
We jumped down from the high hill and entered the tunnel only to find a decaying Commanders Pet at our face. It did not move, i bowes to it, waved to it, poked it. It did not move. Then it was surely charmed as i thought and told my friend. So we walked past and entered Rivervale.<br>
<br>
When we were in, we both traveled to the Priest of Discord and looking at my friends face i suggested he rest for the night as he seemed as if h hadny had sleep in days. He agreed and fell asleep fast right at the feet of the PoD which didnt amuse him to much. I was alone again, and needed nothing from Rivervale so went to Misty Thicket.<br>
<br>
Misty Thicket was very misty, i had always wondered why they called it Misty Thicket and now i knew. Not knowing much about this place i followed the path from Rivervale to a LARGE wall that stretched acrossed the whole Forest.<br>
<br>
From Gwions Directions i travled past the wall and to a cave that was surrounded by Goblins, and goblins, and GOBLINS! They possed no threat to me since i was to strong for them so i sat down to study Gwions Directions.<br>
<br>
Just then two young casters, a Druid and a Wizard were engulfed by Goblins not 10 feet from my eyes. I saw they need help and blasted the Hell out of one and immediatly charged another with my Bloodforge Hammer! I bashed it right in the head and its brains went flying, the goblins were now on me as i tryed to heal the two young casters. As the goblins were attacking me i healed the casters and told them to kill these. And they did one by one not being hurt since the lovely goblins attacked me the whole time.<br>
<br>
When tha was over the casters Cheered for me and bowed. I told them it was not neccisary and i was only doing what my heart told me. I am a big Barbarian with a BIG heart! As i sat down again 2 bixies decided to attack me. I stood there luaghing and so did the casters. I bashed each one with my hand and they fell quickly. Just then 2 Black Bears attacked me together. I said "JEESE!" and quickly disposed of them with my Frost Rift spell. Then...<br>
<br>
Two Young Kodiak Bears attacked me together. I yelled out "CRAP!" and started casting and hitting the bears as the two young casters buffed me with Thorn spells and healed what they could. I killed one Bear in about 30 seconds and began on the other. It hit me for 20 Damage 3 times in a row and that hurt! with blood all over me i put in all of my strength and wisdom and BLASTED the BEAR to Erudin and he fell quickly.<br>
<br>
I thanked the two casters and rested in a safer area to ready for the rest of my trip.<br>
<br>
Before i left the 1 druid caster gave me camoflouge so i would not be hurt on my trip. I thanked them again and wished them the best as they did to me, And i was of to Runnyeye.<br>
<br>
Runnyeye had the horrible stench of rotting flesh. It looked like the Great Cyrstaline Dragon itself had made waste in this horrible keep. From Gwions directions i traveled along the right wall of Runnyeye when i cam into view of a Goblin Shaman. It could not see me! I had my camoflouge on. I went on to the Gorge.<br>
<br>
Gwions directions stated to travel along the left wall of the Gorge avoiding any contact of any beast. With my camoflouge still in tact. Muddite Minor after Minor kept making there way past. I Thought to myself this was to easy since the Minor's werent even strong enough to face me! But then i saw my worst fear...<br>
<br>
A Minotuar. The creature that had slayed my father was right in front of me. And my rage was so great i almost charged it! But i held myself back and realized i would end up like Malof Spritstrik, my father whom is dead becuase of these Minotuars in this Gorge. I ran past it staring at its face thinking of the day i will come here and slay these beasts. When i was past him i noticed that i was about to un-camoflouge! Apparently my rage had worn the spell of. Just then a Minotuar spotted me! He mummbled some words and i took off for my life!<br>
<br>
I wasnt sure wether to fight to my death or run like a coward. I chose the coward way knowing i would come back one day. ONE DAY!<br>
<br>
When i reached the end of the Gorge, i thanked the Tribunal Hammer and stepped forward into the Karanas, where i would meet my next challenges...<br>
