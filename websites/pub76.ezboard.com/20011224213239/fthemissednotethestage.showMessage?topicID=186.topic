This is my first time at the Missed Note, and I figured I should introduce myself. I'm not the best storyteller, so please bear with me. *clears his throat*<br>
<br>
I was born in the trade city of Freeport. When I was still a young child of ten years, My mother, looking very worried, handed me a vial and told me to drink from it. The concoction tasted vile, but my mother must have known what was best for me. Suddenly my skin began to tingle, and as I looked at my hand to see what was happening, I had disappeared! I started to say something, and my mother said, 'No matter what happens, you must stay silent! But whatever may come, always remember that your father and I love you' <br>
<br>
Still happy with the effects of the potion, I decided to sneak out of the door and take a look around places I was not normally allowed to go. Just as I reached the door, I heard a loud banging, then BAM the door was knocked down, barely missing me. Still remembering what my mother had said, I ran to the corner and held my hands over my mouth. Two members of the Freeport Militia stormed into the house. <br>
<br>
&quot;Where is the child,&quot; the shorter of the two sternly asked my mother. &quot;You will never get your hands on him! We know your plan and the citizens of Freeport will never go along with it,&quot; she screamed, in a voice I had never heard her use before. &quot;We have your husband, and you know the penalty for disobeying the Freeport Militia,&quot; said the soldier with a touch of anger. My mother spat on his shoe and turned around. Suddenly she turned around with a dagger in her hand and lunged at the guards. But alas, they were too quick and knocked it out of her hand, and grabbed her and held her hands around her back. I started to cry out, then remembered I was told to stay silent. <br>
<br>
The guards started dragging my mother out of the house, kicking and screaming. I desperately needed to know what was happening, so I followed. The brought her to the town square, where I saw my father standing on a podium, tied up, with an emotionless look on his face. As they brought my mother up on the podium, I noticed she had calmed down, and had the same look on her face as my father. There were hundreds of people gathered around, to see what was going on. I looked around trying to find a clue as to what was happening, and suddenly the man who had taken my mother began to speak. &quot;Hear ye hear ye. Good people of our Fair City of Freeport! These two on this stage are hereby found guilty of the crime of Treason! They were party to a plan to attempt to overthrow our own Freeport Militia. The penalty for treason is Death!&quot; <br>
<br>
A large man with a black mask covering his face walked slowly up to the podium. The guards grabbed my father and pushed him down to a large block... Excuse me, I can't bear to talk about what happened next... I'm sure you can figure it out.<br>
<br>
After this horrible act was done, I ran out of the city into the Eastern Commonlands. I was so filled with rage and anger I started attacking everything in sight. I became a vagabond, stealing food and drink, killing orcs for the pure pleasure of killing. It was a dark time in my life.<br>
<br>
After ten years of this, Erollisi Marr came to me and showed me the ways of love, but that is another story. She told me to seek out Tholius Quey in her temple in Freeport to begin my training as a cleric of love. Many adventures have passed, which I may recount to you later, and here I am today!<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoyed the story, and thank you for letting me in such a wonderful place as the Missed Note! <p><center>Camthan Canheal<br>Ghetto Fabulous Vicar<br>Don't love them Hoes<br>Officer of Vis Veres</center><br><center><img src=http://camthan.homestead.com/files/ghettofab.jpg></center><br><center>Feel the Funk baby!</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usasi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sasi</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://a1060.g.akamai.net/f/1060/597/30minutes/www.zing.com/picture/pad9e25fb1e1af65a8eddd5c924e825d5/feadd13d.gif height=33 width=27 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Genial Dictator</span><br> <font color=#000000>(4/5/01 12:06:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Steps up to the stage..</span><hr size=1> Hey there, Camthan!

I liked the image of the crowds in Freeport. It always seems so empty. A town like that should be filled with folks walking around. I picture it to be like the town of Sanctuary (I think thats the name) from that series of books edited by Robert Asprin from way back. I forget the name (the second was _Tales from the Vulgar Unicorn_), but they were collections of short stories by many authors but all taking place in the same, seedy town. <br>
