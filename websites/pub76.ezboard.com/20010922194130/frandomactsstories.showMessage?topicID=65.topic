Everyone started looking around, as if trying to see if some sort of a god had appeared in their midst giving off its own light.  A quiet murmur, as they congratulated each other for surviving the three hour ordeal, was all that was heard in the room.  Only one man did not join in the celebration of their survival.  His eyes, his chest, slowly rising and falling, and one finger, slowly tapping buttons on a keyboard, were the only signs that gave evidence to the life that beat fiercely within his breast.  His eyes scanned screen after screen, ruby lights turned amber for a few seconds before changing their collective minds and settled on emerald.  In the dim lights of emergency power, three hours had gone by as if to prove to them that man had a limited time on this earth.  Now that the power had been restored, the man named Angel had to make sure that there were no problems in the place that he and three quarters of a million others called home.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The command center was oval shaped, 35 feet from end to end and 25 feet across the middle.  Two large video screens looked at each other across the middle of the room and between them was a round cylinder that stood three feet off of the ground.  Its official name was the tank.  It used special energy field technology to create three dimensional images that seemed to float above the top of the tank.  Ten people could run all of Eden from this center even during the worst of emergencies.  There were about 20 people here now but that was because the power had gone out during a shift change.  The command center had two elevators and two lifts used for going down to the lower levels.  And one set of stairs leading to the observation terrace.  The terrace encircled almost all of Eden valley.  One side looked out over the ice and the other looked into the ice dome covered main recreational park.  The main park was about 29 miles from one end to the other and the center of the dome was almost a mile high.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The vid?com screen at Angel's elbow came to life.  In the center of the screen was a young looking, smiling face.  &quot;Fahr to com center.  All systems have been restored.  And just in case you haven't noticed, we have also brought communications back on line.&quot; The resemblance between the face on the screen and the motionless man in the chair was startling.  Both had the same bottomless blue eyes, feathered back, long blond hair and strong facial features.  The only real difference between them was that Angel had prominent, pointy ears that poked out through his hair, was a few inches taller, and he also had broader shoulders.  Angel looked like an old english portrait of an elf given life, while Fahr looked more like a model from a teen magazine.  &quot;Okay big brother, are you going to tell me how you knew that Morav was going to sabotage the computer, not to mention the damage that he did to all the major systems?  I mean, if you hadn't changed all of the computer protocals and come up with the new emergency power plan last week, we would be in some serious trouble right now.  So fess up.  How did you know?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You're not as surprised as Morav will be when the team that is following him takes the stolen skimmer away from him, or when his necklace starts to melt.  Not to mention how surprised he is going to be when he finds out that all of the information that he stole from our computer is nothing more then useless gibberish.  He had hoped to sell all of our technology for power, money, and fame in the United States.  And now he has nothing of any value to sell to them, or anyone else for that matter.&quot; The smile on Angel's face was very malicious, and devoid of any warmth.  It had been a good plan.  No one had been hurt, and they had gotten rid of someone who had proven himself to be worthless to anyone but himself, Angel thought.  And he felt that he had proven to his people that they had chosen the right person to be their leader.  &quot;Get a hold of the group and tell them that I want a meeting in two hours.  I'll explain everything then.  Or are you going to whine, like when we were kids, and tell me that you can't wait until then?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Man, did someone get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, or what?&quot; Fahr had gotten over Angel's humor, and had even learned to kid around as well as his brother, some years ago.  The secret, he had learned, was 'don't take it personally'.  &quot;Huh, if only girls could see how bad tempered you really are, then maybe the rest of us guys might have a chance of going out every now and then.  But nnnoooo, all the girls ever see are the big muscles, those big innocent eyes, and those tight coveralls that you wear around Eden.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Tell everyone that I want to see them in the meeting room, and then see if you can get the main generator back online.  And if you do, I might even tell you how GI knew about you and Carmen staying at her house when we were kids.  Com off.&quot; As the screen went blank, Angel couldn't help thinking that Fahr looked like he was having problems with a sunburn that seemed to be spreading very quickly all over his face and neck.  It looked like it might be painful, maybe he should have Rainbow or Medusa take a look at it?  Angel chuckled softly to himself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *You know something, you really should quit trying to goad everyone around you into apoplectic fits.  You know he's a little more sensitive then you are. Keep it up and he might start to develop an inferiority complex.  Heaven knows why, but everyone already thinks that you're unapproachable.* The voice in Angel's mind was soft and musically lilted.  He looked around and saw the owner of that voice getting off of the secured maintenance lift across the room.  A grin stole across his face as he recognized whom she was walking with.  Psych being only five foot one, always floated a few inches off of the ground when walking with someone taller.  Most people would have thought that it was because she was insecure about her size, but in reality it was because she didn't like to walk very fast.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A person meeting Psych for the first time, was always startled for the first few seconds.  Her pearly white skin or her long white hair were enough to warrant a second glance, but then add the long pointy ears that peaked out through her hair or the bright scarlet colored eyes that said louder then words that she was a genetic freak of nature, an albino, not to mention the fact that she had the face and grace of a model, it really made a person stop and look. Looking, Angel thought, wasn't expressive enough.  People gawked at her.  Angel couldn't help but to remember the reactions of the norms when him and Psych had been traveling around in the norm world.  Of course she had always hidden her ears but she had always refused any type of stain, make?up or even contacts to hide her features.  There had always been men, norms and ments, interested in her company wherever she went.  She was intelligent, quick, funny, very athletic, and no matter what was happening around her she always remained in control of any situation.  Many people had tried to take advantage of her apparent innocence and had learned, much to their chagrin, that she was far from innocent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Where Psych was small and feminine, Bobcat was anything but.  He stood six foot four inches tall, had, what could only be described as a barrel chest, and weighed about two hundred and forty pounds.  As Angel watched his two friends walk, and float, across the command center, he couldn't help but think about the differences between them.  Bobcat's long blond hair was pulled back into a pony tail and he swaggered across the floor, almost like he owned the place.  He was one of the best in the electronics field while she was one of the best *mind tappers.* No matter what anyone said, Angel knew that *mind tapping* was one of the hardest mental talents to have.  Tappers had to *dive* into the mind of someone with some sort of a mental illness.  Sometimes the problem was psychological, sometimes the problem was biological.  Either way you had to straighten out whatever the problem might be and in a few days, the person could return to a normal life.  As they crossed the space between the lift and the command console where Angel sat, Bobcat talked to the people that he knew as he walked past, while Psych looked at the floor a few feet in front of her.  Bobcat wore american made jeans and a cowboy tee?shirt, while Psych floated along wearing what she always wore in Eden, her usual pristine white, cowled robe.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey, Angel, I've done a complete check of all systems.  I figure that the damage should only take a few hours to repair, unless of course we run into some sort of a difficulty, but I don't think that will happen.  We were able to find most of the bombs that Morav set up and the only ones that we didn't find ended up being in non?essential areas.  I'm still trying to figure out why he put one of the bombs on the waste recycling aqueduct on section M?6.  There's nothing down there.  Of course it would have taken weeks to clean everything up in that area because of the stair wells and the pump wells down there.&quot; Angel remembered one of Bobcats old girlfriends saying 'One thing about Bobcat, is that when he gets excited he talks like he's afraid that if he doesn't get it out quick, his brain will over load and then he'll never get the chance to let you know what he thinks.' Her name had been Lilly.  She had died in an underwater quake that had killed forty seven really good people.  &quot;Most of the bombs that he did put in essential areas were on the backup systems, not the main line systems.  Almost like someone had told him where to put the bombs but gave him false information by switching main lines for backups, which makes me think, 'An Angel Plan'.  So how did you give him the wrong information?  Don't tell me he just walked up to you one day and said 'Angel, I'm going to purloin some information from the computer and then run away very fast, so I'm going to need a diversion.  I know, I'll blow up half of Eden and make a run for it. Where should I put the bombs so that they will cause the most damage?'&quot; The whole time he had been talking he had only looked at Angel three times.  The rest of the time he had been pushing buttons on his ever present handheld C/C unit, communicator/computer up link.  They all knew that the C/C's were just one of many ways in which they were more advanced then the norms.  Bobcat was directing more then sixty eight cleanup and repair details while having a quiet meeting with one of his best friends.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When the founders of Eden had first started the colony in 1554, it had been decided that they would spend a lot of their time making a better life for their people.  Since most everyone involved in the colony had some sort of mental gift, they knew that they would spend a lot of their time trying to understand their talents and working on making them stronger.  They had also decided that in the future they would figure out how to recreate the same affects of their talents through artificial means.  So they had also spent a lot of their time on science.  In 1908 when they sent out one ship to see what was going on in the rest of the world, they were shocked.  In 354 years they had developed so much faster then the rest of the world that they were not only still witches and warlocks because of the things that they could do with their minds but their science was greater then that of the rest of the world.  They decided that it was time to make a decision.  One, They could conquer the world, using their science and their minds to defeat any that refused to yield to their obvious superiority.  Two, They could bring the rest of the world up to their own level scientifically and reap the rewards (or be crushed and destroyed for being different.) Or they could continue to hide their existence from the rest of the world for as long as possible and start to help the norms along their way very, very discretely.  The debates went on for months.  No one wanted to do anything without thinking the whole thing through very carefully. In the end they decide to keep their existence hidden and to help the rest of the world as much as they possibly could.  And now 462 years after the founders had first started to build their homes in the ice, and 108 years after they had decided to remain secluded, it was finally time for them to move back out into the real world.  In the process of finding ways to detect holes in the ozone layer, scientists in the United States had finally developed the means of finding them if they stayed where they were.  Antarctica had been a great place to hide but now they were on the verge of being found.  And to make matters worse, the colony now had to deal with its first traitor.  And his name was Morav.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'll tell you as well as everyone else when we have our meeting in two hours.  If you need any parts that are hard to reproduce, I told Shadow and Wild child to be in the production lab as soon as the power came back on line. And let me know when the main generators are up and running again.&quot; Angel had gotten into the habit of saying as much as possible without using as many words as he usually would when Bobcat was like this.  Bobcat started walking towards the maintenance lift as soon as Angel was finished talking.  One thing about living and working with people who could read minds, Angel thought, is that they know when you are done talking.  He had been around norms enough to appreciate that talent in ments.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Psych was standing off to one side absently staring at one wall on the other side of the room.  There was a very faint glow in her necklace, almost like a very tiny diode without enough power to give it sufficient light.  In 1767 by the norm calendar, a Dr. Kravont found that while working with some crystals that he had grown in a vat using organic materials and radioactive isotopes, as he telepathically called out to his son in another room while holding one of the crystals it had started to glow.  He broke contact with his son and the light had faded quickly.  After some study of the crystal he found that when a person using a mental talent that dealt with the reaching out of the mind, was in contact with one of the special crystals, the radioactive isotopes absorbed a tiny fraction of the energy used and reacted by glowing. The more mind power used by the mind, the brighter the glow.  Since the Dr. had always kept very detailed notes, it wasn't very long before he had made some adjustments to the formula and was mass producing them so that everyone could have one.  It wasn't very long afterwards that parents started giving them to their new born children as necklaces.  This became a tradition in Eden.  It became easier finding out what each persons talent was.  All they had to do was wait for the necklace to brighten announcing the reaching out of the mind.  By *following* the searching mind they could then *see* what the mind did when it reached its destination.  After that it was just a case of getting the proper teacher to teach the child the full uses of that talent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Angel could feel Psych reaching out with her mind, testing to make sure that everyone was dealing well with the present situation and not feeling *stressed out.* *You know Angel, you could have saved some of us some grief if you would have warned us ahead of time that you suspected, or even knew, what Morav was going to do.  Don't tell me you don't trust your own people?  If that's the case, point them out to me and we'll find out what they know.  Then my team and I can take care of them and make sure that they never think about treason again.  Or is it me that you don't trust?  Oh well.  Everyone seems to be handling the situation quite well.  Oh, by the way, Fresh just found the computer program that Morav used to dump all of the information into that portable hard drive that he used.  I'm really kind of curious to know what you plan on doing about that contraption.  Even if you made all of the computer files that he accessed today into a cryptographers nightmare, he still has the means of creating a small fortune by taking that hard drive apart, patenting the concept, and then selling the idea to some major computer company.* Psych could speak thirty three norm languages but she preferred using her mind to communicate because it was quicker, and there was no way that anyone could misunderstand what was *thought* to them.  No explanations were ever necessary.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Just like I told everyone else, I'll explain everything in the meeting. If I keep answering everybody's questions, I'd have to explain everything sixty times or more.  This way I only have to explain everything once and that way no one gets confused.  By the way, do you happen to know if Medusa or Rainbow got a lot of causalities in the medical center?  As usual, after an emergency, all of the com lines are full and it's not enough of an emergency for me to use the emergency code to clear some of the lines.  She has that white field up and I hate the feeling of that thing when I stick my mind through it.  Mom and Cuddles' suggestion of putting that field around the med units to keep the sensitives from going nuts from all of the pain coming from the people inside of the units, was a good idea, but that thing hurts.&quot; Just as real white noise makes it impossible for anyone with a microphone to hear a conversation, the white fields made it very difficult for a ment to *see* or *hear* anything inside of one.  A ment could still *reach* through one but it caused excruciating pain, and could even make someone enervated.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *I haven't really heard any news about it but I'm sure they had a few bumps, bruises and maybe even a few sprains.  The power did go out kind of quickly.  There must have been at least a few people who lost their equilibrium during something like that.* As she had been sending, a memo had popped up on the main computer screen informing Angel that Cat and Animal had just docked in K?dock3, and they wanted to know if Angel wanted to see them. Now where had those two been, Psych wondered, while all the excitement had been going on?  She had wondered why she hadn't seen either of their names on any of the bomb removal teams.  Those two loved suicide missions, and yet they hadn't even been in Eden.  The only thing that they liked better then a suicide mission was hunting and tracking OH!...hhhhmmmmmm...maybe..<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Angel typed in a confirmation to the memo, and requested their presence in the control room.  As she had read the memo, Psych had floated close enough to Angel that a long sleeve was moving over his knuckles.  He watched her out of the corner of his eye.  Even after all of this time, he still felt a little weak when she stood this close to him.  Locked away in the back of his mind, where she couldn't see it, he wished that things could be different then they were.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Psych had been born 'Anna Marie'.  Her mother had been a norm who hadn't known the secret life of her boyfriend.  She had died giving birth to the albino girl.  If they had been in Eden, the young mother probably wouldn't have died.  When 'Anna' had been only three months old, her grieving father had brought her to Eden.  He told all of his friends and family that he just wanted to forget.  He had no one else to blame for his loves death.  He should have brought her to Eden to marry him after the Dr. had told them that she was pregnant.  He had died when she was eight in a faulty skimmer accident.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Angel's father had been a member of the council of elders at the time of his death and had decided that it would be a good idea for his son to have a sister.  Angel's mom had died when he was 12 and he seemed to have adjusted to it well.  So his father had thought that Angel might be able to help 'Anna Marie' cope with the loss of her parents naturally.  And Angel was only six years older then his new sister, so his father figured that there shouldn't be all that much a problem.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After his father had told him why they were taking in a new family member, Angel had taken his job as big brother and teacher very seriously.  He taught her self defense, everything he could find about the norms, and the basics on all of the sciences in Eden colony were part of her schooling.  If she had an interest, he did everything in his power to make sure that she knew everything there was to know on the subject.  By the age of 12, she was recognized as the best female battle board flier in the colony.  By the age of 13, she could outmaneuver everyone in skimmer tag races.  She could also play most mind contests of skill better then most of the elders.  Just before her 14 birthday, she had gills surgically implanted into her neck and started to explore the ocean.  By the age of 15, she had explored over half of the world that lay undersea.  By the age of 16, she had been on the Eden orbital space station and the Eden lunar research facility.  By the age of 18 she had traveled extensively over all of the norm countries.  Talon Cord had also named her as the next Dreaming Prophet, a title very much like the pope for the norms.  She immediately started training for this title in earnest, but she never stopped exploring, pushing herself to new limits.  Throughout it all, Angel had been by her side. She was the best female battle board flier in the colony, but he was the best of them all.  She couldn't lose him at skimmer tag.  He showed her how to clarify her thoughts for mind contests.  In the ocean, out in space, on the moon, travelling the world.  He made everything okay, and he made sure that she was the best at everything that she tried.  He never raised his voice towards her, he never lost control of himself.  But he had lost his heart to her.  He was 20 when he realized what was happening to him.  For a few months he had fought the feelings.  It was during an underwater cave?in, just off of the coast of Florida, that he had come face to face with the truth.  He could love her, as long as she didn't know it.  When at the age of 18 she had followed the custom of choosing the name she would use throughout her adult life, he hadn't let her use him as her Gom Na'de, because he had never been a boyfriend or a lover.  In the back of her mind she saw him as her brother, a teacher, a protector, her confidante, her best friend, and even as her hero.  But she still didn't think of him as Angel the man.  Until then, things couldn't change, he knew.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Angel fought to bring his thoughts and emotions under control, Cat and Animal got off of the main security elevator.  Angel knew that if he didn't get his thoughts and emotions under control, and quickly, he would probably start to broadcast everything that he had spent years trying to conceal, so he concentrated on thinking about his two friends walking towards them.  Cat had been one of the first to undergo the still experimental procedure, code named, the Morpheus project.  Cat looked very much as her name implied.  She had tawny, black striped fur that covered 98% of her body.  Her nails had been surgically removed and glassteel blades that looked exactly like well manicured, one and a half inch finger nails had been put in.  She could see in an almost complete absence of light and whiskers grew out of her upper lip, on either side of a cute little button nose.  She even had a long, fur covered tail that seemed to move as if it had a life of its own.  When given a choice of what she had wanted to mix her genes with, she had chosen a Bengal Tiger. The science team had given the success of the project only a 50?50 chance, because they had not been very optimistic of the compatibility of the genes involved, but because she was the only volunteer, they went ahead with the project and her wishes.  That had been fifteen years ago, Angel thought, fifteen years for her to learn about the new being that she had become.  Would he ever get used to the new Angel?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Animal was a different case all together.  He had been born blind and deaf. When he had been old enough to get replacement transplants, he had requested that the implants be made to his specifications and that they do a little bit of, what he called, Morpheus magic on his nervous system.  One of the major changes that he had wanted changed about his whole body, was that he wanted all of his senses heightened above normal and faster reflexes.  He also wanted the healing processes of his body augmented so that he would heal faster.  Because of his specifications, the implants couldn't be done using all organic replacements, they had been forced to combine organic parts with computerized implants, making Animal a cyborg.  Not the first, Angel knew, but certainly the science divisions best.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cat and Animal walked through the room like ghosts.  No one seemed to be aware of their arrival or even of their movement through the command center. And in all likelihood, nobody was.  Angel, Cat, Animal, Psych, and a few others, had long ago mastered a mental masking technique called 'cloaking in shadowed thoughts'.  Cat and Animal practiced this technique as often as they could, walking through crowded rooms, down corridors filled with people, and even through areas secured with cameras and sophisticated equipment.  They couldn't totally hide from cameras, but the images looked like shifting, ghostly shadows.  Angel had divided his special team into little groups that sometimes overlapped into each other.  Because of special talents that many of them had, they worked well in more then one group doing the projects that Angel felt needed to be done.  Cat and Animal were the leaders of the team that was jokingly, and sometimes seriously, referred to as the Assassins Squad.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When they stopped next to Angel's command desk, Animal grabbed a chair for Cat, and then they waited quietly.  Angel had known both of them for so long that he could tell, just by watching them walk across the floor, that not only had they succeeded in doing what he had asked them to do, but that they also knew something that they felt he needed to know.  He also knew how patient they were.  They would wait until he was ready before they interrupted his private thoughts.  He couldn't help thinking that they would make great parents when they finally decided to have children.  The founders only knew how proud Angel was of how well he and Cat had raised Tyger and Calli.  Clearing his mind of these distracting thoughts, he looked up at the vid?screen, entered in the code for a level by level code 1 systems check, and leaned back in his chair.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Angel turned in his chair just a little bit and found himself looking into Cat's asian green eyes.  &quot;You spend any more time with that computer, and we're going to have to start thinking about good names for the kids.  Chip for the boy and I think Byte sounds like a good catholic name for a girl.&quot; Cat's voice was so low that if it had been any louder in the room he would have had to sit forward in his seat to hear her.  Angel had known Cat since he had been a child, and he had always liked the sound of her voice.  But the purr that had been an after effect of the change gave her a very seductive and servient tone. But the slight tilt of her head and the eyes that didn't waver were a notice to anyone who would pay attention that retribution was her reward to anyone who tried to make her do anything that she didn't want to do.  A few men had tried to prove that she was only bluffing, that no women could resist a real man. Some were still friends, but most had not liked the lessons that they had learned.  Angel had always respected Cat for her strength of spirit and for her ability to challenge the odds and win by their rules.  And Cat respected Angel for his many accomplishments and especially for his gift of patient, unconditional love towards the young lady who couldn't return that love.  Angel usually told Cat what he wanted done and then let Cat command the project team the way she saw fit.  But when he needed something done a specific way, he explained to her why he wanted, or needed it done his way.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;How about taking a walk out into the terrace?  Everything is okay up here, and I need to get a little exercise in before Medusa comes looking for me wondering why I haven't been to the park in three days.  You wouldn't believe the extreme things that she does to make sure that her patients get the prescribed amounts of rest or exercise.  She put some sort of virus into my computer three weeks ago that made the screen go nuts with messages to exercise and the P.A. system in my living quarters kept calling me to the garden area for aerobics or calisthenics or something and it didn't stop until I got into the lift headed for the garden.&quot; Anyone listening would have thought that Angel was just rambling with old friends, but in actuality he didn't want anyone to hear the report that these two had to give to him.  As he stood up, Angel painstakingly unfolded his wings from behind the chair.  He then carefully draped them forward over his shoulders, almost like a cloak.  Enough people had stepped on the fringe of his wings since he had gotten out of the Morpheus tank that he tried to keep them out of the way as much as possible.  It had been eight months since he had stepped out of the Morpheus tank, and he still wasn't used to the feel of them upon his back.  His back had expanded eighteen inches to accommodate the new groups of muscles that gave him the power of flight.  That was what made it all worth while.  To race through the heavens using his own propulsion!  Everyone had kept telling him how insane he was when he had made the public announcement and told the people of Eden what he planned on having them do to him while he was in the Morpheus tank. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Angelion</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#006400>(12/15/00 11:02:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Part 2</span><hr size=1> And that he was making of himself a symbol for his people, to show the norms how different the people of Eden really were.  'Wings?  Whatever for?  If you want to feel wind in your hair so bad, just strap on a flight belt and fly around the ice for awhile.'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When they reached the hallway leading to the observation terrace, they found the hallway completely empty.  &quot;Did you two have any problems following Morav?  He hasn't found the tracer I planted on him, has he?&quot; Even though his actions didn't show it, for months now Angel had been very anxious about Morav finding the tracer that had been planted on him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No, we didn't have any problems following him and since he didn't throw the ornamental belt away or leave it behind, I don't think that he realizes that it isn't what it looks like.  It was pretty easy going as a matter of fact.  But he did have the cloaker on before he cleared the dock doors.  To bad he didn't know that the frequencies could be changed on a cloaker to make it undetectable even by our own modified radars and scanners.  It would have made the hunt a little more of a challenge.  He headed straight for the United states.  Florida to be precise.  Using the planted remote, Cat deactivated the lifting field on the skimmer, in five percent increments every 45 seconds, right after we got over the land, just like you told us to.  And just like you said he would, Morav figured that the skimmer hadn't been serviced properly by the mechanics who work in the docks.  When he landed it in a secluded field, he got out, leaving the portable hard drive unit in the cockpit.  Just as he reached the front of the skimmer, Cat reactivated the lifting field system, and as he was opening the front end, she turned the field on full power.  It took off so fast that he was knocked down.  At an altitude of 200 feet Cat got into his now vacant skimmer and we headed for home.  The whole situation went basically as we expected it would, except for one minor detail.  He wasn't alone.  There was a young lady in the skimmer with him and she was a willing passenger.  We wouldn't have known that she was with him except that Cat had put a listening device in the cockpit and she had also brought an I?R along to see what he was doing in there and also to make sure that he hadn't brought along any unscheduled surprises.  One of our implosion devices would have made him a moderately wealthy man, not to mention what it would have done to us if he had ever figured out that we were following him.  Ever since the computers came back online here in Eden, we've been trying to correlate who the young lady might be, but we haven't had any luck so far.&quot; Animal had been giving the report in a very soft, even tone of voice.  Angel had always been amazed at how much emotion Animal could express with his voice, even though he had been tested in the usual way and found to not possess tele?empathic talents.  As he finished, he handed Angel a video?cam disc.  Angel knew without even looking at what was on the disc, that Cat and Animal had turned the video?cam on when the alarms had sounded and that they hadn't turned it off until they had parked the two skimmers in the dock area.  They were that meticulous about keeping him informed of what they did during the missions that he gave to them.  It also made it impossible for anyone to accuse them of doing things that weren't considered exceptable by anyone else.  It had never happened, but they couldn't have become as good as they were without learning about the pitfalls of their profession.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Morav grabbed the girl as soon as he was able to stand up and ran off into the trees.  We activated the self destruct mechanism in his necklace and the last time we saw him, he was clawing at his throat like it was on fire.  We decided to come home at that time since the tracking device in his belt buckle was working.  We couldn't get hold of anyone on the com system so we thought that we should make sure everything was okay here first, then decide what needed to be done about Morav.&quot; They were standing by the rail in the observation deck with a view looking out over the ice.  Cat was staring off over the ice as she finished speaking, with Animal standing behind her with his big hands on her shoulders.  Angel had let his wings open up, and was looking at his own reflection in the glassteel that separated them from the outside world.  Psych floated in the middle, seeing in Cat's and Animal's minds what they had seen.  Angel, as he had been for some years now, was blank to her. Somehow he had learned how to make himself undetectable to the mind of a sensitive.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If she closed her eyes, Psych could feel the life of everyone around her. She could feel the love in Cat and Animal's touch.  The kids just 50 feet away playing float ball tag.  The woman two floors below them just leaving the storage room with the circuits that she had been sent there for.  But she couldn't feel Angel.  If she touched his skin she could feel his emotions, radiating through his skin like sunlight through a thin piece of cloth.  She couldn't even remember when he had ceased to exist to her mind.  She hadn't become aware of it until a few years ago after he had almost gotten sealed into a cave that they had been exploring just off of the coast of Florida.  If he reached out with his mind, she could *see* what was there on the surface, but when he pulled back his mind, he was gone again.  Like a ghost that had arisen just to say goodbye.  While she had been growing up, anytime Psych couldn't sleep or had been awakened by a nightmare, all she had to do was *feel* the gentle presence of Angel down the hall and she would feel like the world was OK and she could drift off to sleep.  Now she had nightmares that Angel was dead and when she awoke she still couldn't find him.  She woke up screaming.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We've already had Nav?Sat 10 lock onto the tracer frequency and programmed it to track him.  He started moving faster about 45 minutes ago so it looks like he found some sort of transportation.  I still don't understand why you took such a risk and let him go.  You could have just locked him up and found out who he has been in contact with out there among the norms.  But you're the boss and I'm not here to tell you how to do your job.  I mean, there's so much going around here, with the projects and all, that I would have problems following the rumors let alone the events that are shaping all of our lives.  You probably know some things that made you chose to let him go.  So what would you like us to do now?  Do you want us to go after Morav or what?&quot; Since Animal stood six foot five inches tall, he looked over Psych's head at Angel.  As he finished speaking, the necklace around Angel's neck started to glow.  At first it was very brief, someone asking for permission to speak to him.  When he gave his consent, it started to glow steadily, as the contact remained constant.  Angel's expression didn't change.  True telepaths like Angel could carry on a mental conversation without moving their lips or changing facial expressions, while very few people who used artificial means to do the same thing could.  And only half of the true telepaths could talk mentally to one and physically to another concurrently.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the necklace still glowing, Angel looked at Animal.  &quot;Why don't you two go on down to your rooms and clean up.  There should be a message on your computers informing you about the meeting I've requested.  We'll decide what we're going to do then.  Psych, would you come with me please.&quot; The last wasn't really a question.  Angel made a quick decision and reached out with his mind. The necklace was still glowing as they headed for one of the main elevator units.  The elevator doors opened just before they reached them, and another elevator opened right next to it for Cat and Animal.  When Angel had known where he was headed he had signaled the elevators that they were needed on this floor and he had even given the destinations of both parties so that they wouldn't have to after they got in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ice was just found in the cybernetics lab.  No one reported the locked doors earlier because they thought that they had been secured because of the power outage.  Security found Department Chief Crypt and had him override the locks.  They found Ice in one of the back labs unconscious.  They think that he might have been in the middle of one of his experiments when the power went out and that he might have gotten caught in a power surge.  No one knows what projects he's working on, all they know is that I was the one who gave him full access to the Cybernetic labs.  Rainbow is on her way with an emergency team but they won't move him until I give them the okay.&quot;  Psych could tell that Angel didn't like the news that he was still receiving from the security team.  And she also knew that if Ice died, Angel would feel like it was his fault.  It wouldn't matter that Ice had harassed Angel for six months to allow him to start working on some experiments that he wanted to try.  Or that Angel had made Ice take tests for over two weeks which had proven that he was not only as smart a everyone had always said he had to be but that he did know as much as he needed to know about cybernetics to work in the lab.  Angel was like that.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just as the elevator door opened, Angel's necklace stopped glowing.  They moved quickly down a magenta colored hallway.  At the first junction they continued forward but at the next they turned right and at the T?junction they turned right again.  Angel being ahead of Psych almost ran into the young security officer standing just around the corner.  Proper procedure should have been for her to be radiating a mental *do not pass* message, but she was in the middle of a heated discussion with a scientist who worked on this floor, telling him that he couldn't pass through this corridor, even though two other security officers were lounging against a wall nearby, *talking* quietly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *And what do you two think this is?  By the look of her badge, she's supposed to be mentally warning off trespassers and you two are supposed to be enforcing it, but instead you're talking about some ¿girl¿ you saw last night, while she's arguing with somebody about right to pass?*  Mind search...contact. *GI, I want these two on report and I want them in my office tomorrow morning for re?assignment on Garbage Tour!  Now, you two, get over there and help her clear this hall!* GI saw everything through Angel's mind link.  And even though Angel had not *broadcasted* on a wide band that anyone could pick up or with a lot of force like most people usually did when *broadcasting* while they were really angry, there was no doubt in either of the two security men or GI that Angel was furious.  As Angel turned away from them, he was already making a mental note of the two mens names that he taken from their minds.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes sir!  Sorry sir!&quot; *Of course Angel!* The two men almost ran each other over in their frenzy to do as they had been ordered to do and before Angel had reached the door that was his destination, they had politely, but firmly told the scientist that he needed to come back later, and since she had not heard the conversation between Angel and the men, the young lady was mildly surprised at them for finally deciding to do some work.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The door to Cybernet Lab 1201?R slid open just before Angel was close enough for the proximity detectors to be activated by his *mental* need and clearance to enter.  GI stood just on the other side of the door and Angel could feel in the other man's mind that since Angel might need his services, the two officers down the hall would get double the yelling when GI had the time.  Standing six foot even, GI was every inch an army drill sergeant. Bobcat's mother, whom everyone called Mom, had found him in Arizona on leave. He had been plagued by headaches since the age of sixteen and when she had told him that there was a quick and easy cure, he had been kind of curious about it but hadn't really believed that she could help him.  Mom had realized almost immediately upon meeting him that GI was suppressing his talent so much that he was giving himself headaches and would probably die of a malignant tumor somewhere in his brain if she didn't help him soon.  After learning that he was a telepath, and being taught how to use his talent, he hadn't suffered from another headache again.  He had reported back from leave on time and less then a year later when he had been handed his papers for reenlistment he had declined.  He had been in Eden ever since Angel was 18.  Angel couldn't believe that it had been only eleven years since GI had come to Eden acting like no one could be trusted, which was the main reason he had been made security chief two years after being excepted into Eden.  As Angel looked at the dark brown wrinkles that ringed the dark brown eyes, he couldn't help but think that GI hadn't aged a day since coming to live amongst them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's not a pretty sight Angel.  There are wires and gadgets everywhere. But there isn't a lot of blood and even though there is stuff on the floor, it looks like it might have been knocked off of one of the tables.  It's my personal opinion that he knocked it off when he fell.  In other words, I don't think that it was foul play.  All of the computer logs say that everyone left when they were supposed to and that he made an entry into his private file just five minutes before the power went out down here, which was over two hours after the last person left.  And none of the motion detectors noticed any movement in the rest of the labs since then.  Beyond that You'll have to ask Rainbow.  She's in there with Ice now.&quot; As he had been talking, GI had been leading them through the lab areas different lab sections.  Everywhere that they looked everything was clean and everything seemed to have been put away, almost as if for an inspection.  But Angel knew the head researcher of this lab and also knew how much of a stickler he was about the lab being cleaned when everyone left their work station to go home for the evening.  They went through three different security doors before they reached the back labs. As they entered the lab that had been assigned to Ice, the first thing that Psych noticed was that up until this point, all of the other labs had been surrounded by transparent glassteel, whereas Ice's lab area was surrounded by opaque glassteel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Angel had seen through GI's mind link everything that had been found in this room, but it still didn't make much sense to him.  Ice was still comatose on the floor, even though the position he had been laying in when he had been found had been changed a little and some of debris on the floor had been cleared around him to make room for Rainbows' medical team as they checked him to find out what the problem was.  They had found a little blood and some saliva on one of the work benches but that explained the fat lip that had swollen up to such a degree that it could be seen from the doorway and proved that he had hit his mouth when he fallen to the floor.  Luckily, everything that they had found on the floor was made of one shatterproof material or another.  Only after cataloging all of this did Angel look at Ice.  Wires from a computer along the back wall ran to his legs.  They seemed to be attached to them under the long fur.  The antigravity wheelchair that Ice used was in a corner across the room.  Ice had been born with deformed legs that couldn't even hold his weight as a child so the doctors had removed them when he was only three years old and since no one was allowed to enter the Morpheus tank until after their bodies had ceased to grow, he had spent most of his life in chair like the one he now used.  A special type of cybernetics brace could be used by a child but it had to be changed frequently because it could do some serious damage to the nervous system while the body was growing and could theoretically cause death, even though no one had died from this yet, even though there were a few cases of some one being crippled by the nerve damage.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The main reason that they didn't want to move Ice was because they didn't know what would happen if they unplugged the wires attached to his 'legs', and because they had no idea how to remove the device that seemed to be attached to the rest of his body.  He wore only a pair of boxer shorts under the strange device.  The security officer that had found him had thought it was some sort of a newly designed body brace, but Department Chief Crypt had no idea what the device might be or what it did.  And the legs troubled them almost as much as the strange looking device did because everyone knew that Ice had never had the surgery involved in attaching cybernetic legs to his body.  And Rainbow would have remembered any reports about these legs.  The only surgery that she knew about was the one from seven months ago when they had surgically attached those weird plates that Ice had developed, that supposedly turned signals in the nervous system into electrical impulses, and vice versa, to the stub ends of Ice's legs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone who had looked in the room since they had found him had thought the same thought as they looked at Ice laying prone on the floor.  'Who in his right mind would have cybernetic units that didn't look like human legs attached to a human body?' Ice's legs were those of a large lion, complete down to the last detail, including the claws!  Angel was the only person that Ice had discussed his theory and experiments with so Chief Crypt was at a complete loss to explain most of equipment in the room that had been made specifically from data on the experiment to allow Ice to complete it.  He had not been aware of how far Ice had come along in his studies or even that he had moved into the testing stages weeks before.  The Chief had a portable scanner in hand and was running it over the comatose body, wires and the computer trying to figure out the meaning for the whole setup but so far the scanner hadn't given him any kind of a clue as to how any of it worked, let alone what had happened or even how to disconnect the young man from the whole setup to allow the med team to take him out of the lab so that they could properly treat him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Computer up link.  Computer, I need you to down load private file, ANGEL CODE:  ICE, LAB RAT, security index: alpha, alpha, nine, comma, seventeen zero five, to the stationary computer link in this room.&quot; Angel had stopped by the blank computer screen by the door and spoke into the directional microphone embedded in the plastic around the screens common to all computers in Eden.  Chief Crypt had not been aware of Angel's arrival in the lab but at his request for the private file had turned and slowly risen, trying to understand why Angel had this specific file prepared.  When the screen brightened, it was filled with diagrams and equations.  The pictures and words flowed across the screen faster then most people in the room could follow, but since the file was one of Angel's, everyone in the room knew that this must be his normal reading speed.  &quot;Screen stop.  Okay, Rainbow, I need you to follow that red wire from the wall and detach it from his right leg.  Chief, you need to grab that orange flat oblong thing with the six buttons on it from the corner of the room over there.  It's a key to the exoskeleton that Ice has on.  Rainbow, next disconnect the blue wire with the lights in it from his left leg.  Chief you will find a round node just below his chin, hold the device on to it and push six?one?three?two.  You will find six more nodes going down the front of the suit and the code is the same for each one.  Rainbow, the purple wire attached to the left heel needs to be disconnected next, Zaradr'e, feel around the top of the left leg where the hair starts and you will feel a ring about an inch thick.  Feel around the front and back just below the ring and you should find a indentation on both the front and back.  After Rainbow detaches the wire from the heel, you need to push on the depressions, front first then the back and turn counter clockwise everything below the ring.&quot;  As Angel had been giving directions he had stepped across the room and began unplugging wires in the order that the file said was the right way to take everything apart in case of an emergency.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Okay, Chief, you'll find two nodes, one on the front and one on the back, by each shoulder, do the left then the right, front then back, same codes. Rainbow, you'll find an orange wire attached to the right heel and a black wire running from the front to the back, disconnect the front black one first, then the orange, then the black one in the back.  Zaradr'e, do the same thing that you did last time except turn it clockwise this time.  Okay Chief, let me help you get the rest of the exoskeleton off of him.  Can I get one of you med techs to start monitoring his vital signs and also have you check his brain patterns?  I think he should start coming out of his forced trauma in the next few minutes.&quot;  As Angel came around the body, on the opposite side of where Crypt was working on freeing the last arm from the exoskeleton sleeve, Rainbow felt the right leg come loose in her hand.  The top of both legs were flat except for the seventy five bumps that seemed to match up perfectly with the bumps on the bottom of the flat plates surgically attached to the bottom of what remained of Ice's real legs, which were only about eight inches from the hip bones.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *Rainbow, after you disconnected that last leg, the brain patterns jumped wildly for half a second and they have finally returned to what the file on him says is normal.  Before that I was getting the same weird readings we got when we first got here.  Hold on a second, The scanner says he might be regaining consciousness.  Do you want me to sedate him?*  Yon sul had taken up a position by Ice's head, moving her medical scanner back and forth, up and down the body. Rainbow could see in the mind link that his vital signs had indeed returned to a normal rhythm and she didn't like it.  It was just to easy.  Remove this and that and then the body runs normal again.  Experience said that it just couldn't be that easy, and she always listened to experience and her gut.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Let him regain consciousness but keep an eye on the pain index and if he has any, trace it to the source.  We've got to find out how bad he might be hurt.  Angel, if you have a moment, I'd like to know what these things are and what that bird cage he was wearing is for.&quot;  Zaradr'e put a soothing *touch* onto Rainbow's mind as well as the thought *You're acting like you're back on the navajo indian reservation again.*  And the mental picture of herself also sent by her friend and head nurse of this section was also meant to calm her down.  Her brown eyes were flashing and her lips were a straight, severe line. The feather that she traditionally wore in her hair, in the back, was standing straight up as if at attention.  She hadn't noticed but her hand was resting on the ceremonial knife that she wore on her buckskin leather belt and some of the fringe on her jacket had been pushed up over her shoulder and had gotten caught in the beads braided into her pony tail on the backside of her head.  Inwardly she smiled and sent a silent thank you to her friend.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ice moaned.  His eye lids started fluttering as he fought to regain consciousness.  The necklace at his throat started to glow, and Psych could feel him reaching out with his mind, using the ability that was his namesake. The temperature in the room dropped fifteen degrees in a matter of moments as he absorbed all of the heat in the room.  Those in the room who were empathic could feel his fear, even though they didn't know what the cause of it was.  Now that he was regaining consciousness, Angel lightly *touched* the mind of his young friend, let him see who was with him and told him that everything was going to be okay.  Everyone in the room started broadcasting warm thoughts, understanding that Ice needed to know that he was amongst friends.  Within seconds the temperature ceased its rapid decline.  Moments later, Ice opened his eyes to behold all of the smiling faces inside of his working area.  And then he smiled himself as he looked up at Angel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It worked!  I walked for an hour and a half!  The whole system worked!&quot; And his smile was brighter then anyone elses, inside his heart.<br>
