<br>
Well, enough of the angst.  I thought I'd try something a bit different today.  I hope you like it.<br>
<br>
And to you all who are named in the story... well... ^_^<br>
<br>
*************<br>
<br>
Good morning to you Diary.  Today is a lovely day, don't you think.  I am back in Qeynos again gathering supplies and recruiting brave and intrepid adventurers to join the Expedition.  I do not mean to snub or slight the proud people of Erudin... it's just that more travelers come to Qeynos.  <br>
<br>
It is a shame, but with the current schedualing, Miriel, my minstrel friend, will not be able to attend this Expedition.  I should alter the next one to allow for Miriel to better join up.  She would look around Stonebrunt with a childs awe when she gets here.  She has been so eager and excited to go... and I've, unwittingly, snubber her enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
Well... it is settled then.  I will include her in the next Expedition.<br>
<br>
Diary, I also had the joyous time of meeting Avihenda again.  How different she is from many of the other Erudian Citizens I've met!  She has even honored Donnalinna by making Donnalinna her first sister.  I am very excited to present Avihenda to the guild.  She will make a wonderful new friend.<br>
<br>
Oh... the guild was in rare form yesterday, Diary.  It seemed as if they spent the whole day on how to plan to make Donnalinna look like a clutz.  Even Talasithar... but... but I cannot hate Talasithar.  He... Diary may I tell you something personal?<br>
<br>
Tala... Tala makes me feel so... different.  My face flushes, and my heart beats out of my chest.  And he clouds and fogs my brain so I am unable to speak in more than stammers when he is around.  And I figit like a little girl whose hand was caught in the cookie jar.  Oh Tala!  Even just saying his name aloud gets me aflutter.  Tala, Tala, Tala, Tala, Tala. Tala-sithar.  what would mother think.  Me acting all like a fool in front of a Wild Elf.  And a commoner one at that... who can barely act civil and polite without breaking a sweat... but... but... what enchantment has he cast upon me that I cannot even write about him without getting giddy?!?  It surely must be some nature-magic that the druids practice.<br>
<br>
How dare Varigon make Donnalinna look like an oafish baffon in front of Talasithar!  If it wasn't for Donnalinna's high thoughts of the Marrites and Templar Captain Varigon she'd be very upset with him.  Still... still he said such terse words to me... and he said I wasn't nobility to him.  I'm... I'm not nobility to anyone anymore.  HOW DARE HE INSULT ME LIKE THAT!  What has he ever lost!  Nothing.  He... he acts all kind and honorable and true, and then he goes and slays me with his poison and his scheming!  After all the sacrifices I have made for the Marrites and their cause, this is how they thank me.  I thought... I thought the Marrites were above the Game of Houses.<br>
<br>
But... but I cannot hate him.  He is noble... and he... and he might be correct.  No... he is correct.  Poor, poor Varigon...  he cannot bring himself to face his own fears with Lucan.  And... and such is his kindness and generostiy that he cannot punish those who are only following Lucan's laws... Templar Captain Varigon, Donnalinna has dishonored you, and insulted you for... for slights that you did not say or mean.  And... and he has always been patient with me.  I... i am not worth his patience.  I'm... i'm just a spoiled, insolent, vile little girl... mother always said so... and now... oh how Varigon must hate me for what I said!<br>
<br>
Oh Diary, why is my heart torn in these ways?  I feel so elated and so confused and so giddy and so scared all at the same time.  What fever of the brain has over taken me that I cannot think straight when these two men are around?<br>
<br>
Varigon is so much like Father... So noble for a Youngone.  So Valiant.  And he holds himself with such poise and grace.  He... he never really has said a mean word to me.  And his eyes are so... piercing.  It's like they can look into my soul, and know what I'm thinking.  Father would have been proud to have him in the Twilight Knights.   <br>
<br>
But, but Tala makes my heart beat so... and makes me feel emotions that... that I have never felt before.  And Tala said I was his friend... Tala has always tried to teach me to be wise and kind and patient... to be a good ruler, he said.  And... and he wouldn't do anything to upset me.  His voice... his voice is like the singing of Birds-of-Sorrow... a sound you cannot get out of your head, and makes you feel so calm listening to it.<br>
<br>
Varigon... <br>
Tala... <br>
Varigon... <br>
Tala..<br>
<br>
He... he said I was pretty diary.  No one has ever said I was pretty... he said I was pretty.<br>
<br>
Maybe... maybe he'll ask me to the dance.<br>
