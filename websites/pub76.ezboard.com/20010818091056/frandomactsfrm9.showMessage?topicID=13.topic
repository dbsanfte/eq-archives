So I thiught I could give a few suggestions for you all.<br>
<br>
I enjoy a good fantasy novel. My first was (of course) The Lord of the Rings, wich I have read about 6 times now (I know I am weird) one of them loud for my son when he was around 8 years old. But there are others too, and two not so well known are my personal favourites.<br>
<br>
&quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; a trilogy by Tad Williams. It's a great fantasy adventure in a classic mold, but the persons are much more complex than in most novels. The evil ones are not purely evil and the good ones are sometimes very human too. And they die. Not only the bad guys at the end, but the ones you like too. Not all of course, it's not that unique  =)<br>
It's a massive 3.000+ pages but I enjoyed every one of them.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Farseer Trilogy&quot; by Robin Hobb. A very sad and somewhat different fantasy novel. Also a complex story, but I don't want to spoil the reading by telling you too much about it. Just be prepared for a very different ending.<br>
<br>
So, anyone of you have any personal favourites? I soon need to get something new to read and it would be nice to get some input.<br>
<br>
Safe travels...<br>

Books!  Of course!  Why didn't I ever think of that?  Here I am staring at this dumb monitor, looking at the same spells or watching the water go by, when I could be reading a book! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Thank you so much for the suggestion, Kelwan.  I cannot believe that I, a self-confessed booknut, did not come up with that idea on my own. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :O --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":O"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
On those books you mentioned, I'm familiar with some of Tad Williams' novels but I haven't heard of that particular trilogy.  I'll have to look into that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      Of course, I've read Tolkien (who hasn't) and I'm pretty sure I've also read The Farseer Trilogy (it just sounds too familiar).<br>
<br>
Now it's my turn.  I strongly reccommend The Duncton Chronicles (Duncton Wood, Duncton Quest, Duncton Found) and The Book of Silence (Dunton Tales, Duncton Rising, Duncton Stone) by William Horwood.  Duncton Wood can be read as a stand-alone story if you don't want to have to read a whole trilogy, and it is the best published work I have ever read.  At first it may be difficult to keep reading it because it starts kind of slow, but once you get past the first quarter of the novel you will not be able to put it down anymore.<br>
<br>
Also, there is of course the off-beat humor of Terry Pratchett and his Discworld novels.  Did you know that at least one of his Discworld stories has been turned into a cartoon?  Just another fun fact to know. <p>Respectfully,<BR>

Every third sentence or so, I glance up to the screen ever so briefly to see what kind of progress my mana bar has made.  Of course, only ten seconds or so have passed, so it's not very much.  I can't really get "into" the book like I really like to do, because I'm constantly distracted by how slow my mana is going up.  Honestly, sometimes I wish I played a Warrior so I wouldn't have to worry about that silly blue bar that means all to casters.  <br>
<br>
  As for books!  If you're into Sci-Fi, there is no better series than the Rama series by Arthur C. Clarke, IMHO.  Of course, Weis and Hickman will always be my favorite for Fantasy.  The Dark Tower series from Steve King is absolutely wonderful; I'd give anything to read the next book in this series right now, though it doesn't have a publication date as yet. =(  Orson Scott Card is a wonderful writer...and if you have never read "Enders Game" from Mr. Card, you are missing out on a real treat..tis my favorite book of all time.   <p><b>

To anyone who hasnt read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and it sequels do this now: turn off the computer, RUN to the nearest bookstore, and get your copy NOW! It is simply the funniest sci-fi story you will ever read. You will actually learn the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything (those that have read, dont spoil it for others who read this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Why do we do psychology experiments on mice? Find out here. What species of fish has single-handedly caused more wars than any other life-form in the universe? Read the book.<br>
<br>
On a side note, anything by H.P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard (the original Conan stories), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes), or Michael Moorcock (Elric anyone?) are my favorite reads. (What can I say, Im a sucker for the classics!). My next foray into a new author will be Edgar Rice Boroughs (sp), creator of Tarzan.<br>

If you want real Dungeons and Dragons, try Beowulf.  There's a new translation by Seamus Heaney and it's very easy to read.  This was the first one where I actually understood the dang plot!  It's awesome.  Dragons everywhere, mean monsters, guys getting eaten, kings being weird.  It totally rocks.  I can't recommend it enough.<br>
<br>
If you just want elves, try RA Salvatore.  Aganitte and I went through those Drizzt Do'Urden books in a month or two last summer.

All of you Tolkien and Robert Jordan fans definitely need to begin reading the Song of Ice and Fire trilogy by George R.R. Martin.  The first book is called the Game of Thrones.  This series may be one of the top five fantasy tales ever to be written.  It is very complex, action packed, and the characterization level is high.  I recommend it.<br>
<br>
Michael Moorcock also needs to be mentioned, in particular his Elric of Melnibone series.  The original Dark Elf!!<br>
<br>
Dittos on The Black Co. series, Enders Game, Rama, Dragonlance Chronicles, and Turtledoves alternate history series the Great War.<br>
<br>

 Personal favorites would be &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series by Robert Jordan. For those of you who have not read them or who gave up after books 4-6 (when Jordon must have been trying for an advertising deal with Nyquill) this series is possibly the best fantasy series ever. <br>
<br>
  Now &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by George R. R. Martin is also quite good...so far, though I begin to think he may be catching Jordanitis. (Not by taking up half the book in clothing description, but by taking so long in coming out with the next one). I have also heard that though it was planned to be a 3 book series, he now has 5 or so in mind. Lets see, 5 books x2 yrs per =10 yrs. Yikes!! <br>

Openning the door he is blinded for a moment by the sun coming through the window. Must have left the blinds open the night before. Still groggy, he peers into the mirror and - the SUN? What could the sun be doing coming through the window this early in the morning? OMG what time is it? He rushes to the clock to find that he is already 4 hours late for work. <br>
  A quick shower and he is out the door and on the way. What could he have been thinking, staying up so late last night. Then he smiles to himself. No, it's ok. Well worth the trouble he might get into at work. Finally, after 9 long years the final installment of &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is being written and should be released in a year or so. He had read that in the paper Friday evening and had been so excited, he  re-read all 4 of the previous books over the weekend, finishing the last just before 3:30 this morning. This was incredible news, especially since 2 weeks previous he had read that the final &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; book, book 12, was also being writen this year and would be released around the same time.<br>
  Beginning to actually wake up, he decides to stop and get a cappucino at the BP on the way.  Standing in the checkout, whistling a little diddy to himself, he glances at the headline of todays paper. <br>

 Hehe, hope not, but man the waiting is horrible for these books, especially if you've been reading WoT since book 2 was newest release. And since I kinda rambled a little I think, here is a quick list of others that I might suggest.<br>
<br>
  Steven King<br>
 just about all of them (except the Dark Tower series. No offense to those who like them but.../em:shudders.<br>
<br>
  L. E. Modesitt, Jr<br>
 He has the &quot;Saga of Recluce&quot; series. Seems very original to me and writing is excellent. Only problem is the &quot;in book&quot; time stream is non-existant in the order of release, but the books are stand alone quality anyway so that's not really an issue.<br>
<br>
  Tadd Williams<br>
 the &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; series has already been commented on in an earlier post but is worth mentioning again.<br>

  David Eddings<br>
 his &quot;Mallorean&quot; series is very good, but you may want to read his earlier series &quot;Belgariad&quot; first. Not as good as Mallorean, but still entertaining.<br>
<br>
  Ann Rice<br>
 Another that has been mentioned before, but her whole vampire series and the &quot;Mayfair Witches (I think. been a while since I read them, my sister has them)&quot; series for that matter are both wonderfully well written and are woven together by books like &quot;Lasher&quot; and &quot;Taltos&quot;. Most books written by her under her own name are definately worth reading.<br>
  <br>
  Melanie Rawn<br>
 Another series that seemed refreshing in it's originality. Both her &quot;Dragon Prince&quot; and &quot;Dragon Star&quot; series are related, with &quot;Dragon Prince&quot; being the first set.<br>
<br>
  John Sandford<br>
 His &quot;Prey&quot; books are not fantasy like most of the books on my list. These are ... well I'm too tired to remember the name of the genre, but they are about a Minneapolis homocide cop if that helps with the classification. Very suspenseful and complex. Written under the pseudonym John Sandford by pulitzer prize winning journalist John Camp, and worth a read if you get tired of fantasy or just want something different.<br>
<br>
  J. R. R. Tolkien<br>
 If you are playing EQ and haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; or &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; there must be something wrong. These are the books that started it all for most fantasy readers.<br>
<br>
  And of course there are the many, many books from Forgotten Realms and D&amp;D. Best of them are the first series from Forgotten Realms and the Dark Elf Trilogy from R. A. Salvator. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.<br>
<br>
 Well, that's about it for me. Too tired to remember if I like any of the other books I have enough to mention them. )<br>
 Hope this helps if you are trying to decide what to buy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/ugwion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gwion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b><font color=yellow>RA Council Member</font><br><b><font color=blue>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 992<br> <font color=#006400>(8/6/01 1:23:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: From what I hear...</span><hr size=1> Yay for Stephen King <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I've been reading his books for, uh... &lt;mumble&gt; years (let's just say since grade school) and I've come to feel like I really know the guy.  I'm sure he doesn't feel the same, hehe.  <br>
<br>
Don't worry Ogg, I didn't like the Dark Tower series either.  &quot;It&quot; is another miss, and &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; isn't the best one.  But I just finished The Green Mile and it was awesome -- also since this spring I've read Desperation, Insomnia, Rose Madder, and even On Writing (which, if you are a writer, is about the best book I can recommend, along with Ursula LeGuin's Steering the Craft).<br>
<br>
Aganitte and I have also discovered a great sf writer, Michael Marshall Smith.  He's only written 3 books we can find, the first of which is called Only Forward.  But they've all been awesome, we want him to write more (so if you are reading this or know him personally, tell him to get on the stick please). <p><font color=green face="ARIAL, HELVETICA, LUCIDA SANS"><B>Gwion Llewellyn</B></font><BR> Level, um, 39<BR>Useful druid of Tunare!<BR>

<br>
I surprised that no one has mentioned Silverlock by John Myers Myers.  Out of print, but FIND THIS BOOK.  You won't be sorry, trust me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Neal Stephenson's _Cryptonomicon_ is fantastic, as are his other books _Snow Crash_ and _The Diamond Age_.  The first two should be required reading for folks in my field (information security).<br>
<br>
I'm also a big fan of Lois McMaster Bujold's &quot;Vorkosigan Saga&quot; books.  The main protagonist, Miles, is an amazing character and I've been following his adventures for years.  Bujold is a great author, and while her latest book isn't about Miles (it's a fantasy, while the Vorkosigan books are space opera) I'll probably buy it as well.<br>
<br>
As a long-time reader of Asimov's, I was pleased to discover Kage Baker's &quot;Company&quot; novels after reading the short stories for years.  The one downside is that without having read the short stories set in the same milieu, the books may seem to have a lot of holes.<br>
<br>
Lastly, a plug for my favorite author-without-a-contract - Daniel Keys Moran, who's &quot;Continuing Time&quot; series is being reprinted in limited editions (www.quietvision.com).  _The Long Run_ is the best of the four being reprinted IMHO, and I'm dying for it to be released as I loaned my copy out several years ago and it disappeared.<br>
