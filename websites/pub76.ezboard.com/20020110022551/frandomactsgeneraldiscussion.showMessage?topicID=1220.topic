The council and officers have just handled a problem that we think all of you should know about.<br>
<br>
Today, Grimmbaldis, Askyn, and Neaoh talked to a player named Kamian, who had a problem with an item transfer.  Yesterday, Kamian gave Angelius (whose other characters are Angeluse, Draekon, and Dhameon) two bags of gear and 200pp to hold while he brought his other character online.  Angelius was supposed to give the gear to Kamian's alt when he came back.<br>
<br>
But when Kamian came back, Angelius wasn't there, and Kamian couldn't find him for the rest of the night.  Kamian logged on today and looked for him, found him, and asked for the stuff back.  Angelius, according to Kamian, said he didn't have it anymore and then logged.<br>
<br>
That's when Kamian contacted Grimmbaldis, Askyn, and Neaoh.  The three officers tried to talk to Angelius.  Angelius said Kamian had gone linkdead and he'd subsequently given the gear, some low level bard gear, to newbies.<br>
<br>
That was all Angelius would say, and as the officers tried to discuss the matter further, he detagged himself.  <br>
<br>
In the meantime, Askyn put up 700pp to give Kamian, to replace the gear (the other officers are going to split the cost of paying Askyn back).  Kamian was happy with this solution and said he bore RA in general no grudge, but he wasn't likely to ask Angelius or any of his alts for anything again.  <br>
<br>
Several officers and council members discussed the problem over Roger Wilco -- Meriel, Varigon, Neaoh, Askyn, Grimmbaldis, Uriel, and me.  We agreed that Angelius's other characters should be detagged.<br>
<br>
Everyone should know that in the discussion, we did attempt to give Angelius the benefit of the doubt.  We have not had any previous difficulties with any of Angelius's characters, but it bothered us that he would avoid Kamian and then detag Angelius.  <br>
<br>
It also bothered us that he would give the stuff away when he couldn't find the guy right off -- many of us have been in the same situation, and the obvious solution is to hold onto it for a reasonable period of time, while making efforts to find the other person involved.  <br>
<br>
The council and officers do not like removing guild tags, and fortunately, we don't have to do it very often.  We don't know what made Angelius act this way, and were unable to obtain any explanation through repeated tells.<br>
<br>
It's not like I have to remind everybody, but this kind of behavior will not be tolerated.  We understand that most (if not all) of you are decent people who wouldn't steal from another player, in or out of the guild. <br>
<br>
This post is on the general board instead of the Members Only one, because we want everyone, inside and outside the guild, to know how Random Acts deals with people who steal from others.   <br>
<br>
In any case, this problem was limited to one guild member.  We do not think this problem says anything about the general membership of Random Acts (so please don't worry that everything has gone to heck in a handbasket, OK?).  Nothing like this has ever happened before in over a year of guild history, and we do not expect it to happen again.  <br>
<br>
On behalf of the Council and Officers of Random Acts, <p><font color=green face="ARIAL, HELVETICA, LUCIDA SANS"><B>Gwion Llewellyn</B></font><BR> Level, um, 40<BR>"But we have come to the Oasis of Marr searching for wives!"<BR>
