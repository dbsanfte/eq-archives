<br>
He looked to the instrument now on the ground, yes, the voice, was it just another one of his fantasies gone too far, or could it be, her, the missing note, the Sasi.<br>
<br>
Entering the bar from the kitchen, his eyes found Xanta, it seemed natural for his eyes to wander to her first, she was a beautiful creature, no candle, no latern, no fire glowed like she did, and he was a poor moth drawn to her. He crept behind her, sliding his arm on her back, he looked at the new people who have entered.<br>
<br>
It didnt look like Sasi, but then he rarely saw her hair, but my did she change, and on her arm, could it be, the lone ranger ( okay that wasnt meant to sound that bad, but I suppose it did ) Radgen, his old friend and guildmate from years ago.<br>
<br>
"Its you!!.....isnt it? " He muttered. <p><center>

<br>
Chatter of wide spread conversaitons tickled pointed ears, bringing a smile to her lips as the wood elf wandered about the place, sometimes stopping to talk, others just to listen, all the time soaking in the presence of people.<br>
<br>
Her little circuit finally brings her to a small table in the back corner, the one barely big enough for 2 patrons to sit at.  It was cozy in its little nitch, nestled and intimate with its surroundings, the kind of place where lovers would make moon eyes at the other, or two merchants would dicker softly over a farmer's shipment.<br>
<br>
Tonight though, no person sits at the table.  Instead, its chairs are still neatly turned upsidedown upon its top where no one has yet taken them down.  Myethia's lips curve into a small smile when she sees the apron still folded neatly over one of the chair legs, a white dusty flag hung by her before leaving an empty Note for the last time.<br>
<br>
Looking for long moments thoughtfully at the table and its adornments, Myethia suddenly turns and wanders back to the bar to collect a bottle of wine and matching glass.  Hoisting her finds above the head, she heads back to the table and starts to reset it.<br>
<br>
First, the apron.  Running her fingers over the smooth cloth brings another smile to exotic wood elf features as memories of weaving between tables of laughing Note patrons return.<br>
<br>
The chairs are next, carefully taken down and arrainged <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  just</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so to give the setting its intimate atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Finally, she places the bottle of wine precisely upon the small table top, just within reach yet not close enough to intrude upon the pureness of her wineglass resting upon polished wood.<br>
<br>
Nodding absently in satisfaction, Myethia slips into a chair with the apron resting upon her lap, uncorks the bottle with a soft pop of cork, pours a half glass of sparkling red wine which swirls about in its cage of crystal as she returns the bottle to where it was placed upon the table.<br>
<br>
Pale blue eyes blinking from tears of happiness making them water, the Faemaiden lifts her glass towards the room in general, and murmurs unmindful if heard or not, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Welcome home my friends, old and new.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

He recognized the tall high elf that greeted both him and Sasi but he knew her more from reputation than anything.  Then one of his ghosts appeared behind the cleric, seeming to wrap its arms around her waist.<br>
<br>
Then it spoke.  &quot;Its you!!.....isnt it? &quot;<br>
<br>
With this Radgen realized it wasn't a ghost or his mind playing tricks.  That really was Darkmask there.<br>

&quot;Yes.....yes it is old friend.&quot;  He said with a slight but sincere smile on his face <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
You could see Radgen, who had changed quite a bit from when Darkmask met him, but you still saw that stare. Darkmask knew it too well, he often saw it when discussing old guild house matters of the Sanctuary of Norrath years ago with the then very young ranger who took an entire guild on his shoulders and made it prosper in the face of despair.<br>
<br>
Darkmask respected Radgen, and wondered if he ever knew how much, how much he felt connected to this man, almost like a brother. He admired his work ethic, his steadfastness, his honesty, and his courage. <br>
<br>
His mind wandered to the days they spent in the ocean of tears, hunting a ranger who went astray, that was perhaps their last real time hunting together. Any other contact was distant letters, but he looked forward to hearing about his friend. A burst of happiness surges through Darkmask remembering the past with Radgen, it was nice to remember something clearly, his mind had been so foggy since Xanta ressurcted his bones using an old spell long thought non existant.<br>
<br>
But now, a friend, a brother in arms from the past was standing before him, wanting to embrace his friend, he remembered, the high elven traditions, the codes of conduct, how physical contact is frowned upon, so he proceeded to extend his hand to the ranger, burying his emotions deep, almost stotic like, said, " Greetings Radgen, it is indeed good to see you, you have been missed "<br>

She fingered her glass of wine and a warm feeling spread through her, to be near all of these people she had only watched from afar for all those years.<br>
