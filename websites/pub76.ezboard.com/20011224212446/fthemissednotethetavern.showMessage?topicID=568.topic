She smiles to herself, visualizing the warm embraces and loving smiles exchanged within the cozy tavern. So much history, so much joy and pain - The Missed Note had character.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to add discomfort to patrons new and old, Daeja allows mind as well as her person to wander about. So many feelings, so many emotions washing over her. She could not even fathom how Sasi, Radgen, Dorraxx or Myethia might feel. She smiles to herself, imagining the lifegiver Xanta doting on people, her good heart and good intentions breathing life back into the silent body of memories.<br>
<br>
"How interesting," She muses. "How our lives entwine, one with another. No matter where we might roam, we always end up where we belong...home." <br>
<br>
Home, she knew, was a place many souls search for but never find. The Note was home to many - and the feeling of being amongst family was a comforting feeling. Perhaps one day, she would find her home, too.<br>
<br>
Coming to a fallen log, she slowly sits down, her own personal  troubles pushing their way back into her thoughts. Seeing the halfling was quite a shock...Surefoot never was the type to socialize. Yet, there he was all the same. <br>
<br>
Their relationship had been a good one, a loving one. The trials and tribulations of their individual lives had ultimately been the reason for their differences. No matter how hard they tried to hold it all together, everything seemed to fall apart. There was no blame to either side, she had decided. They simply began to walk down different paths in life.<br>
<br>
Seeing him this day had brought back a torrent of memories that she had locked away. The pain of separation had been too great, even as the courtship with Kennit blossomed.<br>
<br>
Kennit. The mere thought of him made her heart race, a warmth consuming her mind, body and soul. Smiling, she raises her eyes to the heavens, watching the billowy tufts of white drifting lazily amongst the calm, azure sky. The sun was glorious, it's warm rays warming her bare skin, soothing her troubled mind.<br>
<br>
She had come to a stream, the deep blue water glistening like that of an exquisite multi-faceted diamond. She peered intently at her reflection. Who was that woman, clad in battle worn Rygorr chain? Daeja blinked at her image in the calm waters, not recognizing the woman she saw before her. <br>
<br>
Where was the strong-willed, independant servant of Quellious? All that she could see now was a scared and lonely girl. Her long, black hair falling in dark waves about her, as if to hide her face from the world. Her dark, almond eyes, wide and frightened like those of a lost child. She seemed to be a shell of her former self. <br>
<br>
Her mind raced, memories of Surefoot, images of Kennit, thoughts of her friends and family. She loved them all, and did not know how to care for them. Would Surefoot ever forgive her? Would she be a good wife to Kennit? Was her presence at the Note a blessing or a curse? Did she have the will to continue her life as a knight of Quellious? She felt so empty. So lost. So helpless. Ashamed, she fell to her knees at the water's edge, covered her face with her hands and began to quietly weep. <br>
<br>
When she was all cried out, she stood and stared defiantly at her reflection once more. <br>
<br>
"No." She said aloud. "Compose yourself. Quellious, I ask you for your guidance and strength as I begin this chapter of my life. I only wish to serve you, and in that to better serve myself, and those I love dearly. My heart is torn, and with your guidance I know I can find that which will heal it. I am blessed by you."<br>
<br>
And, almost at once, a calm came over her. She inhaled deeply, feeling the weight of her troubles slowly lifting. "I am blessed by your love, Quellious." She spoke softly, her voice trembling, now overcome by a new emotion. Even though she stood alone, she no longer felt alone. The Tranquil had blessed her with peace of mind. For once, after what seemed like years, she had achieved tranquility.<br>
