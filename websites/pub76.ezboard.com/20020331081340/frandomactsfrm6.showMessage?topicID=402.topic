Please read the thread on this forum, &quot;New applicants must read&quot;--it gives you information on what to do and how to join.<br>
<br>
If you see me or other RA members in game, please send us a tell. If you are looking for people to group with, try finding an RA member. We have players and alts of all levels.<br>

Good Journey!<br>

<br>
Thank you for applying for membership of our guild and may I take this opportunity to wish you success in your application. <br>
<br>
We have an application procedure that you will be required to complete in order to enter into full membership of the guild.  I have listed the steps below.<br>
<br>
1. Apply in this forum  ( check!)<br>
<br>
2. Read the Call and Charter, Ethical Guidelines and How to Join: <br>
The Call and Charter detail the principles that our guild are based upon and to proceed you should be in broad agreement with them.  You can find details of them at  <a href=http://www.eqrandomacts.com>Random Acts of Kindness</a><br>
<br>
3. Attend Random Acts Events<br>
There are three main reasons for this, it is fun, you get to meet lots of guild members and most importantly you will need to seek out a sponsor. Details of upcoming events can be found on this message board under Events, Hunting and Gathering.<br>
<br>
4. Find a Sponsor (check ! )<br>
A sponsor is a regular guild member that will mentor you through the fledgling quest/community service and support you in your application.  It is also hoped that you will form a special relationship with your sponsor.  Your sponsor will also be responsible for you.  You can find who is on at any one time by typing the command &lt;/who all random&gt;<br>
(Note: Guild members can sponsor more than one fledgling.)<br>
<br>
5. Perform Fledgling Quest or Community Service quest<br>
Details of the quest can be found at www.eqrandomacts.com and you can perform either one with the assistance and advice of your sponsor.<br>
<br>
6. Guild Tagging<br>
Upon successful completion of your Quest, your sponsor must notify<br>
Meriel Silvertree or Gwion Llwellyn either by posting here on the board,<br>
or through a tell in game,  you will then receive your Random Acts Tag<br>
at the next scheduled First Aid Camp (FA).<br>
<br>
First Aid Camps are generally held every two weeks, the first one on a<br>
Saturday, and the next one on a Sunday.<br>
<br>
7. Probationary Membership<br>
Probationary Membership will last until you attend the *next* regularly<br>
scheduled FA and barring any difficulties you will be accepted into the<br>
guild as a full member.<br>
<br>
8. Alternate Characters<br>
You will be able to have one alternate character tagged every two weeks.<br>
<br>
The road is long Fledgling, but you will find assistance, advice and kindness upon the way. <br>
<br>
If you have any difficulties you may contact the council at <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: eqrandomacts@hotmail.com"> eqrandomacts@hotmail.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--><br>
<br>
Be proactive and seek out guild members near you both in Norrath and here upon the boards. <br>
<br>
For our records it would be helpful if you could provide us with details of your name, class, race, level, playing times, and e-mail address if you have not yet done so.<br>
<br>
Safe journeys to you, <br>

He is still upset that he should have to fear such tiny creatures, but he has learned the hard way not to mess with these little guys. <br>
 &quot;Milenka!&quot; he says, just above a whisper. &quot;Milenka, is yoo in heer?&quot;. Only the quiet buzzing of the taverns patrons great his worried call.<br>
 &quot;Drat!&quot;. Turning and going back into the dusty street of this small village, he quietly curses the gods for giving him this impossible task. He had agreed to take a young druid under his wings and show her the ways of kindness and love in the hopes that one day she would be invited to join the wonderful guild to which he belonged. But not long after he had agreed to this undertaking, she disappeared.<br>
 This was the final stop before leaving Misty Thicket and attempting to travel through Runnyeye, an inhospitable place at best.<br>
 &quot;At least da gods gived me da SoW ta help me. Maybe me kin make it to da Karana's wid not problems&quot;. <br>
 He looks back in dissapointment at his failures of late. He had become quite lazy, camping early, sleeping late. At first he had not even realized that Milenka was missing, assuming that he had simply been sleeping while she was out and about. And now the simple task of finding his lost fledgling had been met with failure at every turn. Maybe this was how the gods chose to punish him.  <br>
 Being punished by the gods was certainly nothing new to Oggarbugg but the thought of Milenka being punished for his shortcomings as well was horrible. She had shown such promise! Already there was talk throughout Norrath of her acts of nobility and kindness.<br>
 Shaking his head in self disgust he begins to run toward Runnyeye and, hopefully, a reunion with his missing druid.<br>
