Discovery (pt 1)</span><hr size=1>         Ardrutha had known this storm was coming for a long time. Seven-day storms happened very rarely,perhaps once every ten to fifteen years, but the older shamans had seen signs of the storm’s approach for the past six moons. Ardrutha, as the oldest living shaman, had special role to play at the storm’s end. While everyone in the shamans’ hall had predicted that Ardrutha would be the one to collect the iceflowers born of the storm, she had not been certain. Often now when she stood, her vision faded to black toward the edges of her sight. Walking to the dock from the shamans’ hall was difficult for her, and left her winded.  She thought she might die before the storm came.<br>
        Yet in the week before the storm, she had been graced with a strong surge of energy. She felt half of her years, and had herself walked to each house in Halas to remind folk of the coming storm. She told them to stock extra provisions for themselves and fodder for their animals. She gave some families with young children the strange wooden games Jinth the one-legged rogue carved. The shamans bought his work out of pity so that he could feed himself rather than resort to begging, or worse trying to sneak and steal.  After talking about these mundane concerns, she reminded each person that they must not open their door after the storm. Any disturbance to the snow would destroy the iceflowers. Their crystalline stems would break, their nodding blue heads touch the ground and turn gray and useless. Only when the townsfolk heard the bells sound joyfully on the clear air could they open their doors. Then, they must join together at the well, where the celebration would be held after the ceremony of protection.  <br>
        Ardrutha chatted with each family, and with her new found clarity and strength, each she saw was precious to her.  Her  heart rejoiced in their beauty, and cried at their ultimate frailty.  Life here is so hard, she thought, the land barren and cold, our enemies many and near. And yet we thrive. We thrive because of the sacrifices of so many lives, so many before us. As Ardrutha touched the cheek of the youngest child in the village, a tear wet the corner of her eye. This is the child I will die for. Him and all the others, I will die to protect. <br>
        While she walked on the hard snow paths, her thoughts wandered to the last ceremony of protection she had attended. It was twenty five years before--she had missed the last to be with a woman at childbed--and the iceflowers had been collected by Trindoth. He was wearing a green ceremonial kilt, and he was adorned with hundreds of silver bells which shimmered in time with his breath. Though he had been stooped for months before, he now stood straight as he handed the precious blooms to the next eldest shaman. She kissed his forehead, then his hands.That was his last human touch. Carrying the iceflowers, the shaman left and stood across clearing from Trindoth, where the town had gathered. The shamans  took their places in front of the townsfolk.  Ardrutha had noticed the peace and joy on Trindoth’s face as she and the others gathered their powers and cast their deadliest spells at him. He died instantly, for he had left himself unprotected. Despite the pain he must have felt, his face was serene.  Four warriors carried him to the bier in the edge of the clearing. Then the children came forward and decorated him, some with dried<br>
flowers, other with paints. All of them left their favorite toys with him to be consumed by the flames.  <br>
        The heat of the fire melted the snow in the clearing.  Each of the adults, in secret, threw something dear to them on the bier. Then, when everyone had sacrificed something to the flames, the dancing and drinking began. With hearts aching at first, they churned weary circles together in the mud. Then as the fire mellowed, and the ale took hold of those drinking it, some joviality was restored. Ardrutha herself remembered the dancing, dancing with old men and young men. She recalled the girls dancing together in their kilts while the children dodged lumbering warriors. Ardrutha remembered walking toward the fire alone, when no one was watching. She could feel Trindoth’s presence, and felt it was calm, filled with love for all of them. She stood there for some time, feeling surrounded with the love of his sacrifice and watched the others dance. She stayed until the fire died out, and then she helped make the bricks with the ashes that were left there. Those bricks replaced others eroding at the edges of Halas’ walls and ensured the walls’ magical protections would stand. Trindoth would protect the city for generations to come. <br>
        Now Ardrutha felt ready to make the sacrifice herself.  On the eve of  the storm, she had walked around the whole of the town, trailing her hand along the wall. Its roughness pleased her hand. The air itself was still, but townsfolk were busy with their last minute preparations. They were merry in their work, stopping often to laugh with each other, knowing this would be their last chance to see neighbors for a while. No one noticed her there by the wall, but she smiled and blessed them all. <br>
        *****************************************<br>
        During the storm itself, Ardrutha found that she needed little or no sleep at all. She spent some of  her time with the other shamans, but found that they were somewhat in awe of her, and thus uncomfortable around her. So instead, she stayed in her own narrow stone room,  making certain that the spells and advices she had recorded were in order.  She moved swiftly, with purpose, often humming to herself.  Her solitude suited her mood. She felt no bitterness. She laughed at herself as she indulged a final vanity and braided her silver hair in hundreds of tiny braids.<br>
        The wind moaned long and loud for the first five days of the storm.  Then snow hissed ceaselessly for the next two. Ardrutha knew the storm would end just before the dawn. She spent the early evening saying unsentimental good-byes to the other shamans.  She retreated to her room, and found she had no desire to eat, but slowly enjoyed a bottle of good wine from the south while she packed her bags. In her main pack, she placed her dark green kilt, and the hundreds of strings of bells she would  don once she had completed her task.  She wrapped each bell in a bit of cloth so that no sound would escape while she journeyed to the frozen field to hunt the flowers. Then, she put the magical bag which would hold the iceflowers into the pack.  She put on her oldest, softest leathers and waited, savoring her wine.<br>
        An hour before dawn, Ardrutha felt her body go taut with an amazing tension. Pain and desire made quick circles in all her muscles. The storm had stopped. Carefully, slowly she removed the hide covering the window in her room, muttering protections as she did. Then, she grabbed a bat wing, and cast a spell. Her feet left the ground. As she floated through the window,  the cold ripping at her only caused her to smile. She traveled quickly. The sun still slept, but the moon shone on the fields of undisturbed snow. She flew over the lake, and made her way through the familiar hills to the tundra. She neared the guard outpost and reminded herself of the steps to pick an iceflower. A hint of pink tinged the east. Ardrutha felt herself to be a creature of speed and cold and purpose as she floated over the frozen hills. I love my people, she thought in a deep and wordless way.<br>
        Cresting the hill to where the flowers ought be, she almost died of shock. There was no snow in the ice meadow. Instead, the field was in bloom with summer flowers, and flowers Ardrutha had never seen in bloom. The sun had risen, and its early glow showed waves of white flowers, pink flowers and purple, and tall grasses gently waving. Butterflies played on the flowers. Ardrutha stopped, hovering in the air, amazed at this miracle. The scent of the flowers overwhelmed her, and she wept. <br>
        Then she saw a movement among the blossoms. It was far off in the field and she made her way toward it. As she approached, she saw what was there. A child perhaps sixteen moons old, had just sat up, and was rubbing the sleep from her eyes with her small fat fist. The child was naked and healthy, and she was sitting on a golden blanket. She had not seen Ardrutha yet, but did not seem distressed to be alone. The child lowered herself to a crawling position, then pushed herself up to a stand. She busied herself with chasing butterflies, as Ardrutha edged closer. The child was beautiful, with golden fair skin and thick curly red hair framing her plump cheeks. Her eyes were brown and lively.  Ardrutha watched the child at play, trying to decide what to do next.<br>
        As she stood watching, the magic in the clearing began to fade. Toward the edges of the field, the flowers were dying. A cold wind bit Ardrutha’s back. Quickly she decided that she must take the child back with her to Halas. She reached into her bag, and pulled out a string of bells. She removed the cloth wrapping, and then swung them high above her head. Their sound was clear and happy in the cold air, and immediately the baby turned toward it. Ardrutha lowered herself to the ground and rung the bells again. As she had  hoped, the baby ran eagerly toward her. Solemnly, Ardrutha handed the bells to the baby. “I think I will let you ring these as we go to town. I will have too much explaining to do.”  While the baby explored the bells with her hands and mouth, Ardrutha scooped her up, and the golden blanket  she had been sleeping on.  She also grabbed a handful of the flowers, hoping someone with herb knowledge would find them useful. At least, she thought, they will help prove my story.<br>
        Ardrutha set off with flowers in her hands, and the baby wrapped in her golden blanket. The baby giggled and smiled as she rang the bells that would summon the waiting town.<br>
