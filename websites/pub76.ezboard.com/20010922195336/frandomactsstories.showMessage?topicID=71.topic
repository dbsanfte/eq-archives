<br>
Once upon a stormy night, on Norrath in the Cold peaks of Everfrost there was a young barbarion named Humaelen.  This tale takes place when Humaelen was but of three seasons old.  He was in the Peaks of EverFrost with his family.  He was wandering around the camp as his family sat around the fire talking of past battles, and things of that sort.  While they talked Humaelen wandered unattended.  He began to wander through the valleys of Everfrost, going down many different paths.  Many paths later he happened to stumble upon a person asleep and hidden in one of these many valleys.  Young Humaelen was amazed, for he had never seen a Person that was of equal stature that wasnt a child too.  He woke this poor fellow up by pushing him around.  When the man awoke he jumped in startlement of being awoke out of a deep sleep.  He said &quot;May Karana bring my heart back out of my throat!&quot;; &quot;My gracious lad why do you startle me so?&quot;  Humaelen started to cry becuase this thing had yelled at him.  The little man Said &quot; I'm sorry little one, I didnt mean to yell but you scared me half to death&quot;.  He said &quot; I'm a halfling, and my name is Siper.  I am omw to Halas.  Where are your parents?&quot; While he was crying He said &quot;I donnnnnnno I'mmmmmm lost.  My nammme is Humaelen&quot; Siper said he'd help Humaelen find his parents.  They looked all night, and the nextday.  They rested a bit and looked again.  After looking for a week The boy Couldnt stop crying becuase he wanted his parents.  They went to Halas, and Siper reported that the boy couldnt find his parents.  The guards sent out a search party, but after several months of search, and running across all of Everfrost Several times to no avail, they felt that the parents were most likely killed by ice goblins or snow orcs.  So the halfling took up residence here in Halas, and took care of the young Humaelen.  Humaelen was depressed for many a months(three years).  (Siper was now twenty years old.)  When the boy was six he wanted to go take vengence on all the creatures of Everfrost.  Siper knew that this would only lead to the young boy's death.  So he thought now that the boy might understand, he explained to him he was one with nature, a druid.  To keep the boy from going to Everfrost and dieing he tried to entertain him.  He maid little whirling winds blow things across the floor.  He got the help of fire flies to entertain him by dancing for the boy.  He even turned himself into a tree outside the house.  He summoned up foods and drinks whenever Humaelen was hungry or thirsty.  He endowed them both with the spirit of wolf, so they could run around Halas for fun.  Humaelen was gettin to be very big now, so if Siper wanted to talk face to face he had to levitate.  On some sunny days they either swam in the Halas lake, or Siper would make them levitate, as they ran around the lake.  All the tiem Humaelen grew even more fascinated by magic.  They often fished in the lake.  All these events helped lead to what Humaelen would become.  Nine years later (Humaelen was now fifteen, and Siper was twenty nine) Humaelen was old enough to begin learning from a guild.  Humaelen had decided to join the ranks of the shamans becuase of his fascination with magic, and becuase he liked to help people as Siper had done for him.  He asked Siper to ask the Shaman guild leader if he could join their ranks and become a Shaman.  Later that night Siper returned with a note for Humaelen to bring with him to the Shaman guild the next day to start his training.  Humaelen said he was eternally grateful for all his adopted father had done for him.  Humaelen came back to see Siper one afternoon, And found him being picked on and ridiculed by some barbarion warriors.  This angered him greatly to see his father someone who had helped him through tough years, and saved him to be picked on for such a reason as being different.  In his anger Humaelen made Siper grow as big as the barbarions if not bigger, then he shrunk the barbarian warriors to as small as Siper had been.  The warriors had no idea of what had happened except that the halfling had grown all of a sudden and they had shrunk. The warriors ran away screaming in terror.  Humaelen has been known for his helping of others, helping those in need as he had been helped, Sticking up for the Ridiculed, and those in need shall get help from him indeed.  ( his favorite saying may be &quot; Those in need I shall help indeed&quot;)  So all who dare be mean and cross his path watch your back.  Before your shrunk and mashed with his shoe smushin your back.<br>
<br>
(While Humaelen trained Siper went off on his own adventures, but he always sent Humaelen word of his adventures, let be by mail, by bard, by druid or wizard, or even the occasional Barb)<br>
