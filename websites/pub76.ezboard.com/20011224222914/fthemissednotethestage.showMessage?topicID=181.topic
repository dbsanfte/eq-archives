                      Chapter Two <br>
                Of Dream Weavers and Ecetera<br>
<br>
  It was another three weeks before Cassandra returned to the world of her kin. During that time she was trying to convince herself that her experiance at the library was real and not just a hallucination brought on by lamination fumes. People around her noticed what she did not. Cassandra was changing. She appeared to walk with her feet faintly off the ground at all times, as if she was merely floating on a cuhion of fresh air. Her eyes, though stunning already, had their magical quality magnified a hundred times over. They possesed a look of wisdom, and shone with the light of two small supernovas. Such is the way with elve's eyes. The Whites noticed her changes as well, and treated Cassandra worse than before. With her newfound endurance she put up with it, but no one can stand alone forever. So on a March night she decided to return to the elves. Cassandra slid the ancient text out from beneath her pillow and hesitantly cracked open the black covers. As before, all swirled into darkness. <br>
   She awoke this time in a bed as large as her room at the White's. Her slender frame was lost in a massive quilt sewn of assorted flowers and mosses. When she finally worked her way out of the monstrous bed, she saw Galen and Dathyl playing a game with illuminated dice that had unfamiliar characters carved on the sides. Apparently Dathyl had won this round, because the dice she had been playing with rose into the air and circled her head before dropping into a bag at her waist. Cassandra was jerked from her thoughts on this odd game when Galen's voice addressed her. <br>
   &quot;Hello matweno eyes. I thought you would never wake. How do you like your new clothes?&quot; Cassandra noticed a large pile of elven clothes fitted to her size lying on a nearby chair. One thing caught her eye, something encaged in a diamond pendant suspended on a chain of green links. When she inquired about it she got the characteristically peppy response from Dathyl. <br>
  &quot;It's a dream weaver. If Galen will so kindly leave the room you can change clothes and you can come hunt for more with us.&quot; Galen quickly made his exit and with Dathyl's fashion assistance Cassandra donned a lavender tunic with blue leggings and dragon hide boots. After a trip through the kitchen to pack lunch the trio set out to find more dream weavers. As they picked their way through a field of long, whispering grass, Galen explained all the events since Cassandra had departed three weeks ago. <br>
   &quot;When you left Dathyl started to set up your wing of the house almost immeadietly. Mother had forseen that next time you came you would stay for a good long while. Later you will get to see your whole wing of our home. You arrived yet again in the woods and all three of us, Mother came this time, were waiting for you. We brought you up to the house, tossed you on your bed, and waited in your room for six hours. Finally you woke up after our one hundred and nineteenth game of Shotar.&quot; By this time they had come to a grove of small trees with a pale aura of rainbow light encircling their slim white branches. Dathyl put a finger to her lips in the transdimensional sign of 'shut up' as she handed out small pendants carved of various gemstones. Galen led the way into the eerily dim light of the trees as Dathyl showed Cassandra how to unhinge the pendant and scoop some of the light in. The light, she later explained, was a shapeless resting dream weaver. After collecting about ten of the miniscule life forms they made their way to a flat rock by a small stream. <br>
  &quot;Dead useful things, dream weavers. They can read the future and interpret the past clearer than any creature except the unicorn. Best of all, they bring luck to the wearer.&quot; Galen remarked to Cassandra as they ate dragon meat sandwiches with holly sauce. Cassandra nodded and tried to look as if she understood anything at all. <br>
  &quot;Well, I guess we better be getting back to the village.&quot; Galen said nonchalantly after their intresting repast. <br>
  &quot;Eager to get back to Chameleon, huh Galen?&quot; Dathyl teased her brother. By this time Cassandra's head was spinning from lack of information and holly sauce. <br>
  &quot;Who is Chameleon? Tell me, Galen.&quot; Galen's only response was a huge grin as he rolled onto his stomach in the warm grass. <br>
  &quot;Mmmm...&quot; He purred. <br>
  &quot;Don't expect an answer out of this gnome brain. He has obviously forgotten how to work a rememberring. Toss it here, Galen.&quot; Dathyl said, exasperated. &quot;Rememberring, show picture one of Chameleon.&quot; She commanded the piece of jewelry. &quot;That is Chameleon.&quot; Dathyl pointed out as a picture of a very pretty girl about fourteen years old swam into veiw on the surface of the highly polished stone. The girl, Chameleon, had mahogany colored hair, deep and rich. Her eyes were the same color as Cassandra's moss quilt and reflected light like a cat's. Those green eyes danced and shone in a deeply tanned face. She looked like an elven girl, but not quite. Dathyl must have read Cassandra's questioning mind because she launched into an explanation of Chameleon. &quot;Chameleon is one of the nicest girls in our village. She is of faerie blood, the only one for miles around. In addition she is the youngest member of the Golden Council ever in history. She's also Galen's girlfriend!&quot; Dathyl stated, with obvious delight at the last part of her speech. <br>
   &quot;Rememberring, track Chameleon.&quot; Galen commanded the ring in a sharp tone. Another picture appeared, this time of a real live Chameleon. She was sitting and listening intenly to something, her hair pulled up in a twist. She glanced down and- waved at them? Galen waved back. <br>
  &quot;Chameleon has a Rememberring too. It displays us on her ringscreen.&quot; Dathyl explained, seeing the startled look on Cassandra's face. The ring spoke. <br>
   &quot;Galen, the meeting is almost over. Why don't you, Dathyl, and your astonished looking friend drop in? I'd appreciate your company and afterwards we'll fo to Magwan with Conflure and Komonor. Catch me?&quot; Chameleon paused, waiting for a response. Dathyl gave a sunny <br>
  &quot;Great idea!&quot; <br>
  &quot;Terrific. You can catch the mainstream down to the council house and we'll only have 5-10 minutes left to the Council session. End transmission,&quot; the girl's face flickered and dissapeared from the screen. Quite suddenly, Galen erupted into floods of bright laughter. <br>
  &quot;The look on your pretty face!&quot; He gasped, choking for breath. <br>
  &quot;Well,&quot; Dathyl giggled, &quot;you did look really funny, gasping like that at a rememberring of all things!&quot; <br>
  &quot;It IS rather unusual. They don't have technology that far advanced where I'm from.&quot; Cassandra defended herself. <br>
  &quot;It's pretty well known that men are not well off scientifically, and even worse magically.&quot; Galen commented. <br>
  &quot;Magically? You mean like wizards and all that?&quot; Cassandra asked. <br>
  &quot;Like you and my clinically happy sister. Like Mother. Like Chameleon. You're all sorceresses. Males have definitive talents when it comes to magic,&quot; Galen replied. <br>
  &quot;Like what?&quot; Cassandra inquired. Dathyl twirled a strand of her silvery hair. <br>
  &quot;Well, Galen can alter darkness and light with the help of a control. Komonor can mentally control reptiles. Guy's don't have a magical range, just one talent.&quot; <br>
   &quot;Magical range?&quot; Cassandra was getting confused again. <br>
   &quot;Females that come from magical abilities lines have a broad range of magic to tap. For example, I could use Pyrokinethis to set that bush on fire, use Transferring to remove energy from Galen and transfer it to the fire, I could use Restoration to restore Galen to full energy, when the bush finishes burning down I could use Reanimation to bring it back to life, or Mimicry to turn this rock into a replica of the bush, or Transportation to summon a bush here from somewhere else. Or if I like the way the bush looks burned up I could just leave it. However I don't like burned up bushes and why would I set a bush on fire if I'm only going to replace it? Forget that example. Umm...uhh...duh... Galen?&quot; Dathyl failed her attempt to explain magical range and turned to her brother for help. <br>
  &quot;Magical range means that sorceresses have an endless amount magical resource. If it's magic a sorceress can tap it and use it to it's full magical potential. Healing, summoning, hydrokinetics, illusions. A sorceress can work it all. That, my friend, is magical range.&quot; Galen managed to clear Cassandra's befuddled mind somewhat. &quot;Now if we're going to keep our date with Chameleon, Conflure, and Komonor we'd better leave for the council house in the next thirty seconds, call and tell her we're delayed, or heads will roll. Your call.&quot; He added. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=risika>Risika</A> at: 2/25/01 8:14:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#5F9EA0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bthemissednote.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=risika>Risika</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000000>(2/25/01 8:33:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub76.ezboard.com/fthemissednotethestage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=181.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gate of Elves Part Two</span><hr size=1> Ta-da, big whoop.
