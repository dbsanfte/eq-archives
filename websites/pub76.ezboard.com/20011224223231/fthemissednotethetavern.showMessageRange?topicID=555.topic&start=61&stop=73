Dorraxx grinned and nodded, &quot;If ye think yer up fer it, I kin give ye what Kesryn is drinkin.&quot;  Rainana nodded as the Dwarf poured more of the black stout, this time into a mug for the High Elf. &quot;Ye seem familiar, Lass.&quot;  Dorr commented with a searching look.  &quot;Hae ye been here before, or perhaps, do I know ye from somewhere else?&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&quot;Sasi!&quot;  The Bard's name rang out from all corners of the room.  Dorr's eyes met Xanta's and he smiled and nodded.<br>
Dorr grabbed the bottle of Elven wine, poured a glass and held it out to their prodigal Bard while grinning broadly.  &quot;Welcome back ta tha Missed Note, Sasi.&quot; <p><center><hr size=5, width="55%">

<br>
His long fingers trailed the shelves, reading the labels, finding spices, and perserved foods, his eyes looked over all in front of him, studying it, as he did with most things, he was trying to capture the details in his mind. Darkmask loved to remember, but had forgotten what the best memories were, he overheard Dorraxx speaking about bad memories and making new ones, and he found himself start to well up with sadness inside.<br>
<br>
He looked down at his hands, the magic now odd to control, he begins to remember his phantom going on adventures, how the heart disillusion in him carried enough power to allow for a phantom Darkmask to battle and wage war on vellious, he sees the memories in flashes, but was more of an observer, he remembers the friends his phantom met along the way, and how twisted it had become, obsessive is a good word, it sought power, and it had found it. This was a piece of him, good or bad, it was shard of his soul that had wandered off.<br>
<br>
Darkmask felt his body shudder for second, almost like broken glass suddenly coming apart then back together again, with electricty coursing around him. Xanta had found him, claimed him, restored him, she was the one Karana had promised.<br>
<br>
A moment of fear broke into Darkmask, <i><b>**Larenina!**</i></b>, his wife she was still alive, and his children were apparently alive, how could he have forgotten this? His son Darque was alive, and apparently still searching for his step mother. Darkmask peeked out from the kitchen, watching Xanta from behind, it began to calm his fears, " With her, with his lady love, nothing is too big to overcome. " He thought to himself, as he sighed happily.<br>
<br>
Larenina would have to be dealt with and made to pay for her crimes against the House Disillusion, his children, his parents, his first wife ( Karana rest her soul ), and the patrons of the note, but that would have to wait, now is the time for celebration. The Missed Note was alive.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the building seemed to glow, almost singing....Darkmask knew this all too well, his hand went to his chest," The golden dragon who took her away, has he brought her back to us? " Quickly he picked up a lute from the back wall of the kitchen, he knew it was Sasi's and if this was Sasi returning, she would want to fill the note with her songs.<br>
<br>
Quickly he headed for the swinging door in a rush, only to be smacked in the head as the door swung in, he crashed to the ground and a small gnomish woman looked down at him.... <p><center>

It had a small candle almost burnt out lit on it along with a few unfinished mugs of ale. The thought of taking a sip passed her mind briefly but she decided to pass. She unlatched her backpack and hung it on the back of the chair. She sat down at the table and watched the people around her chatter about various things. She really wasn't listening much, she really didn't care. She heard names she'd heard before from tales, or talk in her council, or just in passing with friends. Memories of wars wanted to evade her thoughts, but she wouldn't let it, not now.<br>
<br>
She caught Kesryn examining her from across the room, in return she flared her nostriles at him and gave him a flat look with her eyes. &quot;You just sit right there, buddy&quot; she said to herself under her breath and look away from Kesryn.<br>
<br>
Beltane reached into her backpack and pulled out a small, bronze colored device shaped like a box with a red button on top. She placed it in front of her on the table and pushed the red button. Whirls and clicks could be heard audibly as a place mat, plate, fork, spoon, knife, and cup unfolded itself before her. She smirked then frowned as she could feel all eyes on her. &quot;What? I'm hungry..&quot; she said as she looked up at everyone staring at her. They went about talking immediately as if nothing had happened.<br>
<br>
She dipped her hand into her backpack once more but did not find what she wanted. Balastin cooked well for her, but there was nothing that quelled her hunger in there. She remember Xanta saying something about a kitchen. <br>
<br>
She got up from her chair and started for the kitchen. The small room was filled with people, Beltane had to shove around them or ask them to move, sometimes she just got on her hands and knees and crawled under them. Finally she got to the kitchen doors, with both hands she shoved forcefully the doors open. They came back at her quickly and she opened them slower this time, peering through the crack before opening all the way. On the floor before her laid a high elf holding his head, covering his face.. seemingly in pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Watch where you are walking, fool, there are little people...!&quot; Beltane stopped herself as she recognized the person on the floor now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir.&quot; Beltane was talking in her most regal voice, reganing her composure, &quot;Sir. My name is Beltane, high counsil the House Companions. I do apologize for this incident.&quot; Her eyes went totally white as she began to chant, her hands slowly moving in a circular pattern in front of Darkmask.<br>
<br>
Her eyes went back to their normal color, &quot;There, sir, your wound is healed.&quot; She knelt before Darkmask.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hear news of your wedding. Xanta sent me a message and sought my blessings. Of course, as a high council member&quot; Beltane was slowly walking circles around Darkmask as if nothing had happened, he still lay on the ground, and she was jestering with her hands as she talked, &quot;I make it my business to know the business of others. I do say that I am most intrigued with Xanta's choice. After all you have had such a.. colorful past. Dare we say you've had a most interesting past, one which Tunare would not look kindly upon. Yet, I do not seek to meddle in the matters of such a sympathetic god. I seek to meddle in the matters of my House. You see, it is my job. I seek to know your intentions, to know of your love for Xanta and the truth of that love. I cannot give blessings of such a matrimony otherwise.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beltane stopped for a moment as if deep in thought, and began her circling again, &quot;I have been a distant witness to the times you've gone astray. High council see's all. What say you to the idea that you could go astray again?&quot;<br>
<br>
She stopped in front of him, looking him directly into his eyes. She could see the fear in him, she could see the small trembles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep faith, Darkmask.&quot; she looked away from him, it was too much to bare, the pain in his eyes that he was showing her.<br>
<br>
She stepped back, her eyes went white again and she chanted:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> A single tear fell upon your cheek<br>
Removed by stroke of tender touch, sublime<br>
And touched by love within each other, seek,<br>

Pain unbound, your souls became as one,<br>
Eternal are you - who seek the endless road,<br>
Another day, another dawn, another sun.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Beltane blinked and her eyes returned to their normal color again. &quot;You have my blessings, Darkmask Disillusion.&quot; Beltane smirked at him, &quot;I'm hungry, get me some food.&quot;<br>

Kesryn arches an eyebrow at Beltane as she wanders off into the kitchen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrmmmm. . .&quot; he ponders for a moment.<br>
<br>
He sighs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Probably best to ignore her, whatever her problem may be and go about my buisness.&quot; He muses outloud to himself, &quot;Besides, I can't stand gnomes.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looks up at Dorraxx.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not plan on setting anything on fire, nor harming anyone lest they attempt to harm me.&quot; He cocks his head to the side, &quot;I wonder if I am still invunerable?&quot;<br>
<br>
He chuckles to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Probably ought not jump off of anything tall to find out eh?&quot;<br>

<br>
She circled him, his head pounding, he started to focus in on her, he noticed some of her armor and markings, a cleric he thought, it must of been her who applied the magic to him, he could feel it sliding through him, warm and soft, yes definatley a cleric.<br>
<br>
He watched her hands move as fast as her lips, he words poured from her mouth in rapid succession, she had an accent, almost like the people of the windmills in steamfront, apparently she recognized him, she knew his name, his mind still fuzzy he tried to remember if she said her name, his head only spun more as she circled him speaking.<br>
<br>
She spoke of his past, and he instantly perked up, wondering had he adventured with this gnomish cleric, she spoke of the council, and a cringe came over Darkmask, and he rolled his eyes, not knowing exactly why, but he knew that was trouble. Her words lept to Xanta and how she was wondering if he was worthy of her blessing.<br>
<br>
He went to speak, but before his lips could part to utter a sound, she kept speaking, stopping to look at him, he looked at her, focusing his eyes, and he watched as she cast some sort of spell, her eyes flashed, and he heard some beautiful words, and suddenly she changed her stance.<br>
<br>
Her little gnome head cocked around the room, searching, she asked about food, so Darkmask pulled himself up, and began to fiddle with some pots and pans, finding spices, he saw he had no fresh meat in the building, he wondered if any ranger was around to hunt him down some fresh meat. <p><center>
