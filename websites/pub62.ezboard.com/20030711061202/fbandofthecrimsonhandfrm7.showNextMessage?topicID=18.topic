       Ok, so as you all/most/some/2 people know, Draigoon went on a pilgramidge for Veeshan after having a vision in his dream.  Well...here's what happened...*flashback wavy lines*  Draigoon, Magicant, Dreadfil, Thriving and Rezurrect gathered in the depths of Greater Fayedar to talk about where they needed to go. &quot;So ya saw a dragon, who told ya ta go all over Norrath and beyond, to gather materials for some statuette?,&quot; Magicant looks over to Draigoon questionably. &quot;Drai: It's an Idol of Veeshan, and yes, that's what happen...&quot;  &quot;Dred: What about Kolenya?&quot;  *Draigoon stares at the ground for a few seconds makes a sigh* &quot;Drai: I can't tell her im leaving...and I can't say why...&quot;  &quot;Dred: Ya know that girl loves ya right?  How do ya think she is gonna feel if ya just up and disappear?&quot;  *Draigoons tone becomes more serious* &quot;Drai: I know, I left her a small note by her bedside.&quot; *Draigoon lays a small map onto the ground* &quot;First we have to go to the ruins of Takish Hiz, in the Eddlar forest, and talk to Lrodd.&quot;  &quot;Thriv: Wait...the city of what?&quot;  &quot;Mag: He's refurring ta Befallen, a fallen city of the Tier 'Dal.  The Eddlar Forest is what is now know as the Desert of Ro&quot;  &quot;Thriv: Uhh...&quot;  &quot;Mag: I'll tell ya the story later&quot; &quot;Drai: Im surprised you remember all that from when we were kids&quot; &quot;Mag: Not like I can help it, you always came over and told me stories about what you learned, I sware sometimes you would never shut up!  Turns out now you get paid for telling stories, heh&quot;  &quot;Drai: Yea, well we can reminisce later, we have to get out of here before my brother wakes up...who knows what he would try to do to foul this up&quot; *Everyone proceeds to walk down the path towards the Scion, chatting about misc. things* ...but elsewhere in Kelethin... &quot;Evil: To my Dearest Kolen...blah blah blah...pilgramige...blah blah...travel...dragons...Idol...quest...ahh, this is too boring&quot; *Evildraigoon crumples up the note and tosses it out the window*  &quot;Evil: So I guess I better tag along and see what my Dragon-hugging brother is up to, mwahahaha...&quot;<br>

A few seconds later 4 more people burst out from the Butcher Block mountains, first a High Elf garbed in a flowing blue robe, weilding a...shovel.  Next is a Vah Shir, in copper and midnight blue armor clanking as he follows the High elf.  Following them is another High Elf, this one dressed in light armor and carrying a mace in one hand.  Finally the forth member bursts from the mountains, this one an agile Iksar more or less jogging then running to keep up with the rest.  The shady wood elf loses his footing, and careens into a tree, hitting the ground with a loud thud.  The High elf stops in front of him, and quickly within the blink of an eye, has him pinned down with her shovel.  The Vah Shir comes to a skidding stop, nearly losing his own balance and risking toppling onto the Wood Elf.  The other High elf and the Iksar catch up, and surround the Wood Elf.  &quot;Mag: You just HAD to do it didn't you?&quot; the High elf with the shovel says to the Wood elf.  &quot;Evil: You wouldn't understand! I had to do it!&quot; the pinned Wood elf pleaded.  &quot;Dread: HAD TO?! We did ALL that work and you just decided you HAD to screw it all up?&quot; the Iksar proclaimed.  &quot;Mag: You are lucky Draigoon didn't see you come in here, I've never seen him as mad as he is now.&quot;  Suddenly a loud, booming voice is heard over the whole Gfaydark forest.  &quot;WHERE THE F*CK IS EVILDRAIGOON?!?&quot;  Everyone quickly looks in the direction of the voice, and they see another Wood elf, adorn in various peices of armor, searching the immidiate area.  &quot;Mag: This is bad, if he finds Evil...&quot; &quot;Dreadfil: Then we stop him, we can't let him get to his brother, no matter what he did&quot;  Magicant begins to cast a spell.  Small green sparkles resonate around her in a hourglass form, and she summons forth a creature from the Earth.  She commands it to guard this spot, and it accepts the command.  The new Wood Elf suddenly spots the group of friends, and rushes over.  &quot;Drai: Where is my brother?&quot;  A small cough is heard from behind Magicant.  Evil gives his brother a half-assed smile, then glances around.  That was it.  Draigoon closed his eyes, clenching his fists so tightly that a small stream of blood ran down his fingers.  His whole body started to tremor with anger, and the second High Elf and the Vah Shir slowly backed away from him, but the Magician and the Iksar stood there ground.  Draigoon then heard a voice.  &quot;This elf, this brother of yours has forsaken me.  You must avenge our ruined quest to create the Idol of Veeshan.  I will grant you limited power, but only as long as you use it to destroy him.&quot;  Draigoon lets out a small whisper &quot;I will kill you...&quot;  Suddenly there was a great flash of light across the Greater Faydark.  Draigoon's eyes burst open, the very core burning with power and hatred.  He then pulled his sword and charged at the Elemental.  Slice, Hack...gone.  Within 2 swipes he had severed the Elemental into 3 peices, then he turned his firey gaze upon his brother.  The Magician quickly moved to intercept him.  Slice.  The High Elf clutched at her stomach where the sword had peirced through...She then crumpled onto the ground with a groan.  Next the Iksar drew his staff and stood against the Bard.  Draigoon takes a deep breath, then bellows as loud as he can at the monk, stunning him. Slice.  The Iksar hit his knees, his gaze transfixed on his blood coating the bards sword. The Iksar fell.  Now there was nothing standing between the Bard and killing his brother.  Slice.  A downward strike proved unsuccessful as the Wood elf parries the strike.  Now on his feet, he holds his two daggers parallel to each other and stares into his brothers eyes.  &quot;Draigoon: You brought this on yourself, brother.  You ruined my quest to proved my alligence to Veeshan, and so now do get back into her good graces I must defeat you!&quot;  With this commetn the bard took a second swipe at the rouge.  Barely dodging this time Evildraigoon falls back, and the sword travels within inches of cutting his flesh.  Draigoon turns and strikes downward again, this time at an angle which would be very hard to parry.  Slice.  The sword hits flesh and bone as it tears into Evildraigoon's hand, forcing him to drop his dagger.  Evildraigoon glances at the dagger on the ground, then to his hand, and then to his brothers unyeilding firey gaze.  He drop to his knees and lowers his head.  &quot;You are too much for me to take on...you obviously have been aided by Veeshan, and I stand no chance.  Kill me now, and get it over with.&quot;  Draigoon follows his brothers orders, and comes down across the back of his neck.  Slice-Clang.  A large sword meets Draigoons within inches of his brothers neck.  The sword easily parries the sword out of the bards hands into a near-by tree.  The bard, never breaking his gaze off his brother until now, turns to the swords weilder.  The Vah Shir glares into Draigoons eyes, and addresses him.  &quot;You cannot kill your brother, I don't care what he did I won't allow it!&quot;  Draigoon then laughs to himself...but not a normal laugh.  The laugh is shallow and deep, cackling yet smooth, the laugh of a madman.  Draigoon charges forward to try and disarm the large Vah Shir...but stops within a foot on him.  A third Wood elf has now appeared, a female.  Draigoon meets her gaze and immediatly recognizes her.  Kolenya, his fiance.  The gaze she returned to him, claim those who saw it, could have stopped Kerafyrm the Desolator cold in his tracks, make him turntail and run.  The voice then calls out to Draigoon again, from the depths of his mind.  &quot;Kill her, she is in the way! No one shall stand in our way!&quot;  Draigoon quickly shakes his head.  &quot;Draigoon: I can't...I won't!&quot; &quot;KILL HER! SHE OPPOSES YOUR GOD! DO IT NOW!&quot;  &quot;Draigoon: I...cannot...cannot strike her...&quot;  &quot;NOW!&quot;  Draigoons body suddenly spasms, and he places both hands on the side of Kole's head, ready to snap her neck.  Kole looks deep into his eyes, she can see the battle that is waging on his mind.  She closes her eyes and a single tear rolls down her cheek.  Then it happened.  Draigoon throws his head towards the sky and screams &quot;I RENOUNCE MY FAITH IN VEESHAN! I WILL NO LONGER DO HER BIDDING!&quot; A bright clap of light blinds everyone and Draigoon quickly removes his hands from Kolenya's head and falls to the ground, lifelessly.  The high elf quickly rushes over to heal the Iksar and the Magician.  The Vah Shir lets out a sigh of relief, and Kole quickly grabs Draigoon and embraces him.  2 weeks later.  Draigoon has been unconscious for over 15 days, and no one knows why, no one...except for Kolenya.  The renouncing of the Wurm Queen Veeshan, while her avatar was possessed within a mortal soul, shattered the frail spirit within when it was expelled.  Kole continued to nurse Draigoon for the following 3 months, until he finally moved a hand on his own.  &quot;Draigoon: ...I...I c...&quot; &quot;Kolenya: Don't speak, you have to rest&quot;  &quot;Draigoon: I c-can...can't rememb...er&quot;  &quot;Kolenya: Just rest for now&quot; Draigoon then passed into a restful sleep.  About a week later, Draigoon suddenly sat bolt upright in his bed.  No one home.  He wandered out into the bustling city of Kelethin, his balance starting to fail him he quickly grabbed the wall.  A guard passing by noticed him standing in the doorway.  &quot;Guard: By the Blessing of Tunare, your alive!&quot;  Draigoon just gave the guard a weak glance, then slid to the ground.  The guard helped him get up and placed him back in bed.  &quot;Guard: I'll be right back, i'll go call Kolenya off duty, I think you should talk to her&quot;  The guard quickly proceeds out of the doorway and towards the Emerald Warriors guild.  A few minutes later Kolenya bursts into the room, a smile quickly spreads across her face when she sees Draigoon sitting up. She runs over to the bed and embraces him tightly.  &quot;Draigoon: I don't un...derstand.  What happ...ened?&quot;  &quot;Kolenya: After you renounced your faith, everyone in Greater Feydark saw what looked like a bluish-white spirit of a dragon rise from your body, and take off towards the sky.  Some think it was Jarad 'Dar, the leader of the Ring of Scale.  Others say it was Veeshan herself.  No true way to know however.&quot;  &quot;Draigoon: ...&quot;  &quot;Kolenya: Can I ask you a question?&quot;  &quot;Draigoon: K, not sure if I can remember the answer though...&quot;  &quot;Kolenya: What was it you heard when you were fighting?&quot;  Draigoon glances around the house for a few seconds, then tries to remember...&quot;K..l He. S.e is in t.. .ay&quot;  Draigoon suddenly feels a sharp pain in his head, and stops trying to remember.  &quot;Draigoon: I don't want to remember...it hurts...&quot;  &quot;Kolenya: It's ok, at least your still on this mortal coil&quot;  *Draigoon hugs Kolenya tightly, then gives her a soft kiss.  &quot;Draigoon: I do remember one thing.&quot;  &quot;Kolenya: What's that?&quot;  &quot;Draigoon: I have the best woman in all of Norrath and beyond, and I love her&quot;<br>
