<p><b><font color="#E6C982" size="4">As a <u>raiding guild</u> the following 
guidelines must be used for the safety of all, and to insure a quality raid.</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b><br>
1. Show up 10-15 min. before posted raid time at the posted meeting spot, be 
there and ready to go. Don't make people wait for you.<br>
<br>
2. Pay attention. At any moment a raiding force can move, jump into battle, or 
need your attention. <u>Please inform group leaders if you must go afk</u>.&nbsp; 
Group leaders must keep the raid leader informed if any of your members go LD or 
AFK.<br>
<br>
3. NEVER send a direct tell to a raid leader. They are juggling 20 things at 
once. Any questions or comments should be told to your group leader or an 
officer. They will keep raid leaders informed.&nbsp; Continued abuse will be warned.&nbsp; 
Repeated abuse will be grounds for guild removal.<br>
<br>
4. Know your zones and mobs. Most prepared wins. If you don't know before a 
raid, search the web, or ask someone. Knowledge is key.<br>
<br>
5. Know your class. We strive for smart players, not pure brute force. Knowing 
your class expectations in any given battle is key.&nbsp; The raid leader should not 
have to tell you what to do in every instant.<br>
<br>
6. “ASSIST” Always wait for the Main assist (MA) or Second assist (SA) to call 
for you to help on a mob. At any given time the MA and SA are deciding what mob 
to fight next, what mobs to unmezz, gaining taunt agro. Any jumping the gun can 
kill an entire raid.&nbsp; No attack call means that the MA fights alone, period.&nbsp; 
Always assist from behind the mob unless directed otherwise.<br>
<br>
7. Please try to attend the majority of a raid.&nbsp; All raids will have an 
estimated duration.&nbsp; If you can safely join a raid after it has begun that will 
be your responsibility to get to us.&nbsp; We cannot stop the raid to add each new 
person, but if you can get to us you are welcome to join.&nbsp; If you must leave a 
raid early please plan for that in advance, i.e., bring gate potions, inviso 
potions, etc.<br>
<br>
8. Keep raid channel (/rsay) clear for information. /rsay is to be used only by 
guild leader/officers, raid leader, group leaders and the pull team for raid 
instructions. Use the raid chat channel (that is set up at raid time), guild, 
group, and say for conversations. Also, keep emotes and food/drink spam low on a 
raid. </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>9. If you need a buff send a tell to the appropriate 
class.&nbsp; Do not spam the raid chat for buffs.&nbsp; Ask those that can do it.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>10. Be patient. Sometimes a raid can be slow, or 
there may be a lot of deaths. Patience will help keep things moving along faster 
than complaints.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>11. If there is a wipe get back to the raid zone as soon as possible.&nbsp; This is 
NOT the time to go AFK.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>12. All peridots, port stones, pearls for CoH and 
coffins will be supplied by the guild raid fund.&nbsp; All guild members should work 
toward owning some sort of enduring breath item, don’t rely on others to keep 
you breathing.<br>
<br>
13. Be ready for the CAMP! call. Never know when we will be in a spot where 
running/evacing can't be done because of logistics. So, when told by a leader to 
CAMP! All rezzer camp &nbsp;without hesitation.&nbsp; ALL MELEE must continue to fight to 
insure that at least one person who can rezz gets camped.&nbsp; Good policy is to 
camp for at least 3 min.&nbsp; You can also come back into raid chat with an alt. and 
check to see if its safe to log back in. </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>14. Planes of Power raid feature will be used on ALL 
guild raids.&nbsp; Therefore it is a requirement that all members have Planes of 
Power. <br>
<br>
All raid guidelines are just that, a guide. But, continually ignoring raid 
policies can be cause for a warning, and in an extreme case be grounds for 
removal. We want everyone to have fun, but also need to keep some kind of Order 
to have a successful raid.<br>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br>
&nbsp;<![endif]></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982"><b><font size="4">Loot Rule/Policy-<br>
<br>
As a raiding guild we will need to keep a large raid attendance to accomplish 
goals. Thus, the system employed in Rise of the Forsaken is Merit/NBG (need 
before greed).&nbsp; Also, you must be of proper class/race to use an item. </font> </b>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>1. Merit means that a particular item has been 
designated for a certain guild member.&nbsp; This item will not be /rolled on by raid 
members.&nbsp; A merit decision will be decided at the time the item drops.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>2. When asked to link an item for possible merit, 
please link the item to be replaced to the Raid Leader to be considered for the 
merit loot.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>3. NBG (need before greed) means that you “can and 
will use” the item, its not for twinking an alt or friend and its not for 
selling for the pp.&nbsp; When an item is to be rolled NBG it will be announced in /rsay.&nbsp; 
A player can only win one item per raid until everyone has won an item. Once all 
have won, the cycle can start again.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>4. Pre-claimed means that a raid leader claims an 
item for a particular person at the time the raid is posted or announced.&nbsp; No 
one else will get a chance to roll on this item.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>5. If no player is able to use an item or no one 
wants the particular item,the item will be placed in the guild bank for the use 
of other guild members.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>6. On class specific items, a player &nbsp;who 
&nbsp;previously won may or may not be given a chance to win this item.&nbsp; This is the 
discretion of the guild leader.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>7. If you go AFK while loot is being merited or 
rolled NBG you will not have a chance at the loot.&nbsp; DO NOT AFK at this time if 
you want to be considered for loot.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>8. Once a loot decision has been made at a raid, it 
is Final.&nbsp; There is to be NO discussion during the raids about any loot 
decision.&nbsp; Save any comments or criticisms for the message boards or guild 
meetings.&nbsp; Anyone continually abusing this rule will be removed from the guild.&nbsp;
</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>9. 2-box or dual-boxing (playing 2 characters at one 
time) is allowed.&nbsp; Thus, those players that 2-box during a raid will be allowed 
to roll for each character they are playing on NBG rolled loot.&nbsp; Both characters 
are helping the raid and therefore should be allowed to roll.&nbsp; Only one 
character can be considered for a merit per raid unless no other player is 
interested in a particular item.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>10. If you are asked to bring a different character 
to a raid by the raid leader, you may roll for either your original character or 
the new one.&nbsp; NOT BOTH.&nbsp; You must specify to the raid leader which character you 
will be rolling for at the beginning of the raid and you may not switch at any 
time who you are rolling for.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>11. Recruits are not eligible for loot at raids 
until they become a full guild member.&nbsp; Sorry but we must think of current 
members first.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
12. If a player is pre-claimed an item they may roll on other items until their 
pre-claim item drops (in case their item does not drop).&nbsp; Once the pre-claimed 
item drops that person cannot roll on any item even a BP, after all you got what 
you really wanted on this raid.&nbsp; Exception:&nbsp; if the pre-claimed item is 
guaranteed to drop, i.e. talisman from Harla Dar, then the person that is to get 
that item will not be allowed to roll on any other items unless “all roll” is 
called.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>13. All merchant fodder and cash loot will go to the 
guild raid fund to help pay for peridots, pearls, coffins, portal stones, etc.&nbsp; 
If you use these items at a raid please ask the guild leader for reimbursement 
after the raid is over.<br>
<br>
14. Raid leaders/officers will be the looters for each raid. Items that are 
tradable will be held till the end of the raid.&nbsp; NO DROP items will be 
announced.&nbsp; You must link your item to the guild leader to be considered for an 
item.&nbsp; Pay attention to the leaders for the loot drops and when you may need to 
roll or link on an item.&nbsp; If you are on an unannounced AFK you will lose out on 
loot, if you are LD we will attempt to wait as long as we can without the item 
poofing.<br>
<br>
15. If anyone leaves a raid early, and something drops that they would have been 
merited, an officer will hold the item for that player in his/her bank. If an 
item becomes a rolled item, the player that had to leave the raid forfeits loot 
rights. Note, you must have been at the raid for a majority of its duration.<br>
<br>
16. ANYONE can lead a raid.&nbsp; Raid leader gains pre-claim rights.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>17. All raids will use the above rules.&nbsp; Any raid 
under any other rules is not considered an official RoTF raid.&nbsp; Your attendance 
does not reflect on the guild or its loot and policies.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#E6C982" size="4"><b>18. When upgrading items, members should consider 
the extent of an upgrade.&nbsp; If an item is a small upgrade for yourself, consider 
passing on the item so someone that is lesser equipped may win.&nbsp; “Share the 
Wealth.”&nbsp; Be fair, not greedy, consider the stats and effects closely.&nbsp; Don’t 
always ask for every item.</b></font></p>
