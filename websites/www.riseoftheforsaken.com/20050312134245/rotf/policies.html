1. You must be level 60+ to join or be in the guild. Alts are automatically invited when they obtain level 51.
<br>
<br>
2. We are a "raiding guild".  Therefore if there is a raid you will be expected to attend.  If you cannot attend you must contact an officer.  Raids are Monday through Thursday, 8:30pm est  7:30pm cst.; Saturday raids start anytime between 1pm est and 7pm est; and Sunday raids can be held anytime after noon est and we be over by 6pm est.  
<br>
<br>
3. Guild chat will be profanity and spam free.  Repeated abuses will be warned, and then will be grounds for removal.
<br>
<br>
4. Any arguing between members in guild chat is not allowed, take it to tells, or talk to an officer. Repeated abuse will be warned, and then will be grounds for removal.
<br>
<br>
5. Any name calling, making fun of, or teasing of another player not deemed in good fun by both members is not allowed. Repeated abuse will be warned, and then will be grounds for removal.
<br>
<br>
6. Any real life racial, religious, economic, gender, sexuality, social status, or age comments are not allowed. We wont be overly critical of this point. But, repeated abuses will be warned, and then will be grounds for removal.
<br>
<br>
7. Any KSing (kill stealing) will not be allowed. Repeated abuses will be warned, and then will be grounds for removal.
<br>
<br>
8. Any camp jumping (stealing someone's camp spawns) will not be allowed. Repeat abuses will be warned, and then will be grounds for removal.
<br>
<br>
9. Any arguments or fighting between a guild member and an outside member is not allowed. If you are having problems with someone please bring it to the attention of an officer or the guild leader.  Repeated abuses will be warned, and then will be grounds for removal.
<br>
<br>
10.Any scamming or stealing of loot is not allowed.  Repeated abuses will be warned, and then will be grounds for removal.
<br>
<br>
11. Any complaining or crying over loot issues at a raid is not allowed. If someone is merited an item, they earned it.  Continued abuse will receive a warning to stop.  Further abuse will be a firm warning to stop and that you will be removed on your next offense.  Third offense will be removal from the guild.  All discusions of loot need to be brought to an officer of the guild leader's attention after the raid is over or posted on the appropriate message board forum.
