<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>As a raiding guild the 
following guidelines must be used for the safety of all, and to insure a quality 
raid.<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; Show up on time, be there and be ready to go. Don't make people wait 
for you.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp; Pay attention. At any moment a raiding force can move, jump into 
battle, or need your attention. Please inform group leaders if you must go afk.<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp; NEVER send a direct tell to a raid leader. They are juggling 20 things 
at once. Any questions or comments should be told to your group leader or an 
officer. They will keep raid leaders informed.&nbsp; Continued abuse will be warned.&nbsp; 
Repeated abuse will be grounds for guild removal.<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp; Know your zones and mobs. Most prepared wins. If you don't know before 
a raid, search the web, or ask someone. Knowledge is key.<br>
<br>
5.&nbsp; Know your class. We strive for smart players, not pure brute force. 
Knowing your class expectations in any given battle is key.<br>
<br>
6.&nbsp; &quot;ASSIST&quot;&nbsp; Always wait for the Main assist (MA) or Second assist 
(SA) to call for you to help on a mob.&nbsp;&nbsp; the MA and SA are deciding 
what mob to fight next, what mobs to unmezz, gaining taunt agro. Any jumping the 
gun can kill an entire raid, or at least make it more complicated.&nbsp; Always 
assist from behind the mob unless directed otherwise.<br>
<br>
7.&nbsp; Please try to attend the majority of a raid. All raids will have an estimated duration. 
if you can safely join a raid after it has begun that will be your 
responsibility to get to us.&nbsp; we cannot stop the raid to add each new 
person, but if you can get to us you are welcome to join.&nbsp; if you must 
leave a raid early please plan for that in advance, i.e. bring gate potions, 
inviso potions, etc.<br>
<br>
8.&nbsp; Keep raid channel clear for information. Use guild, group, and say for 
conversations. Also, try and keep emotes and food/drink spam low on a raid. <br>
<br>
9.&nbsp; Be patient. Sometimes a raid can be slow, or there may be a lot of 
deaths. Patients will help keep things moving along faster then complaints.<br>
<br>
10.&nbsp; All peridots, port stones, pearls for CoH and coffins will be supplied 
by the guild raid fund.&nbsp; Please provide other items such as fish scales, 
batwings, etc.<br>
<br>
11.&nbsp; Be ready for the CAMP! call. Never know when we will be in a spot 
where running./evacing can't be done because of logistics. So, when told by a 
leader to CAMP! do it without hesitation.&nbsp; Good policy is to camp for at least 3 
min.&nbsp; You can also come back into raid chat with an alt. and check to see if its 
safe to log back in. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>12.&nbsp; Planes of Power raid 
feature will be used on ALL guild raids.&nbsp; Therefore it is a requirement that all 
members have Planes of Power. <br>
<br>
All raid guidelines are just that, a guide. But, continually ignoring raid 
policies can be cause for a warning, and in an extreme case be grounds for 
removal. We want everyone to have fun, but also need to keep some kind of Order.<br>

<p><b><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><br>
</font></b><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>Loot Rule/Policy-<br>
<br>
As a raiding guild we will need to keep a large raid attendance to accomplish 
goals. Thus, the system employed is Merit/NBG (need before greed).&nbsp; Also, you 
must be of proper class/race to use an item. &nbsp;&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>1. Merit means that a 
particular item has been designated for a certain guild member.&nbsp; This item will 
not be /rolled on by raid members.&nbsp; A merit decision will be decided at the time 
the item drops (some places we will have no idea what drops and therefore cannot 
claim the merit in advance).</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>2. NBG (need before greed) 
means that you “can and will use” the item, its not for twinking an alt or 
friend and its not for selling for the pp.&nbsp; A player can only win one item per 
raid until everyone has won an item. Once all have won, the cycle can start 
again.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>3. Pre-claimed means that a 
raid leader claims an item for a particular person at the time the raid is 
posted or announced.&nbsp; Only 1 item per raid can be pre-claimed by a raid leader.&nbsp; 
No one else will get a chance to roll on this item.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>4. If no player is able to use 
an item or no one wants a particular item, then the whole raid can roll for 
twinking or selling.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>5. Only time any of these rules 
may differ, is on class specific items.&nbsp; Then, those who have previously won may 
or may not be given a chance to win this item.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>6. In some cases, a raid will 
be designed to get one class or character upgrades. This will be done so the 
guild as a whole can advance in power, and abilities. These types of raids will 
not be common, but will be needed in some cases. any raid of this type will be 
clearly posted as such a raid. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>7. Once a loot decision has 
been made at a raid, it is Final.&nbsp; There is to be NO discussion during the raids 
about any loot decision.&nbsp; Save any comments or criticisms for the message boards 
or guild meetings.&nbsp; Anyone continually abusing this rule will be removed from 
the guild.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>8. 2-boxing or dual-boxing 
(playing 2 characters at one time) is allowed.&nbsp; Thus, those players that 2-box 
during a raid will be allowed to roll for each character they are playing.&nbsp; Both 
characters are helping the raid and therefore should be allowed to roll.&nbsp; Normal 
loot rules apply to 2-boxers, except only one character can be considered for a 
merit per raid.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>9. If you are asked to bring a 
different character to a raid by the raid leader, you may roll for either your 
original character or the new one.&nbsp; NOT BOTH.&nbsp; You must specify to the raid 
leader which character you will be rolling for at the beginning of the raid and 
you may not switch at any time who you are rolling for.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>10. If you bring an alt. 
character to the raid just because you want to play someone different, then you 
roll for the character you are playing.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>11. Recruits do not get the 
chance to roll until all members have passed.&nbsp; Sorry but we must think of 
current members first.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
12. If a player is pre-claimed an item they may roll on other items until their 
pre-claim item drops (in case their item does not drop).&nbsp; Once the pre-claimed 
item drops that person cannot roll on any item even a BP, after all you got what 
you really wanted on this raid.&nbsp; Exception:&nbsp; if the pre-claimed item is 
guaranteed to drop, i.e. talisman from Harla Dar, then the person that is to get 
that item will not be allowed to roll on any other items unless “all roll” is 
called.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>13. All merchant fodder and 
cash loot will go to the guild raid fund to help pay for peridots, pearls, 
coffins, portal stones, etc.<br>
<br>
14. Raid leaders will decide the looters for each raid. Items that are tradable 
will be held till the end of the raid.&nbsp; NO DROP items will be announced and 
rolled when possible.&nbsp; Pay attention to the leaders for the loot drops and when 
you may need to roll on an item.<br>
<br>
15. If anyone leaves a raid early, and something drops that they would have been 
merited, an officer will hold the item for that player in his/her bank. If the 
item would have been rolled against someone else with same merit, an officer 
will roll for the player. If an item becomes an open guild roll, player forfeits 
loot rights. Note, you must have been at the raid for a majority of its 
duration.<br>
<br>
16. ANYONE can lead a raid.&nbsp; Raid leader gains pre-claim rights and allows you 
the opportunity to participate in the Loot Council, if you so choose.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>17. All raids will use the 
above rules.&nbsp; Any raid under any other rules is not considered an official OFC 
raid.&nbsp; Your attendance does not reflect on the guild or its loot and policies.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Felix Titling" color="#E6C982"><b>18. When upgrading items, 
members should consider the extent of an upgrade.&nbsp; If an item is a small upgrade 
for yourself, consider passing on the item so someone that is lesser equipped 
may win.&nbsp; “Share the Wealth.”</b></font></p>
