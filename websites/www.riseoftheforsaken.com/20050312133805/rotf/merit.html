All items will be merited by the guild leader and officers.  We use this system to insure that the proper items go to the proper class and to insure that loot is distributed fairly.  
<br>
<br>
So everyone has a better idea of how meriting will be done the following are guidelines that the guild leader and officers take into consideration when deciding a merit:
<br>
<br>
1.  Attendance.  Raid attendance will be considered since we are a raiding guild.
<br>
<br>
2.  Guild Advancement.  Merit should go towards advancing the guild.
<br>
<br>
3.  Common Sense.  A flowing thought IV item is not a warrior item.  High wisdom items are not pure caster items, etc.
<br>
<br>
4.  Class. If the item is best for a particular class.
<br>
<br>
5.  Upgrade.  If the item is a major or minor upgrade.  Also when the last major upgrade the player obtained with the guild.
<br>
<br>
 
<br>
<br>
In closing, the above are guidelines that will be used when and how an item will be merited.  These are only guidelines and not LAW.  The guild leader and officers will make every effort to distribute loot in a fair manner, that is best for the guild.
