Rise of the Forsaken is always looking for good, smart, adventurous players. If you are looking for a guild that raids and groups together and treats one another as family and friends, this will be a good home for you. If you are looking to be in the Plane of Time as fast as you can, this will not be the guild for you. We are not an alt. guild, we are looking for players that will be committed to our guild.  We are a "Raiding" guild, we raid 5-6 days per week, if you are online we request you join all raids.
<br>
<br>
Presently Rise of the Forsaken is working on getting Emporer keys and collecting our shards, etc. to gain access to Vex Thal. We also will be taking down many named mobs in other zones (including Planes of Power) and raiding Ssra Temple for armor upgrades. As we level, upgrade armor and flag members we will continue working toward what is necessary to get our guild into the old world high end content and elemental planes. 
<br>
<br>
We do have a few rules for joining us, please read all rules/guidelines/polices on the main website Main Page
<br>
<br>
It is important that we get to know you and you get to know us, this cannot be done in a few days.

- Rules and guidelines for recruitment--
<br>
<br>
1. All petitioners must read the guild charter, policies, raid/loot rules, and merit guidelines on the guilds main page, agree to them, and adhere to them.
<br>
<br>
2. You must be Level 60+ (unless you are a class that is presently has increased requirements).
<br>
<br>
3. Your recruitment process will be for a minimum of 6 raids and will not take longer than 30 days. 
<br>
<br>
4. All recruits will be required to receive 15 yes votes before 8 no votes. Voting will not begin until the 6 raid requirement has been met. 
<br>
<br>
5. You will not become a full fledged member of RotF until you have completed the required flags, received your 15 yes votes, attended at least 6 raids and when the guild feels we know you well enough. You will be notified by an officer when you have reached permanent membership.
<br>
<br>
6. Must have a current member sponsor you (if you do not know anyone in the guild, we will assign you a sponsor). Your sponsor must have been a member for a minimum of 30 days before they can sponsor you. It is your responsibility to talk to potential sponsors that will be listed on your application response.
<br>
<br>
7. Keep in touch with your sponsor for upcoming raids/events that you can attend. Also try to group with guild members as much as possible. Let us see you and know you have a real interest in this guild. It is your responsibility to keep in touch with the guild.
<br>
<br>
8. Contact any officer or your sponsor for the recruitment/alt. channel that is on at all times. Its a good place to find out what the guild is doing that you can join in on.
<br>
<br>
9. During raids recruits will be tagged. Meaning you will get a guild invite at the beginning of a raid so you may interact with us through guild chat and be a representative of our guild. At the end of a raid you remove yourself from the guild. Guild chat is used a ton by our guild even during raids and this will give us as well as you an opportunity to get to know each other a bit more. This shows you are committed to us and lets everyone get to know each other. Please don't be shy, talk to us, let us get to know you.
<br>
<br>
10. Please do not recruit our guild at the same time your are recruiting another guild. We want dedicated people to our guild.
<br>
<br>
11. If your application expires before you have completed 6 raids and 15 yes votes, you may re-apply and go through the 6 raid process and 15 yes votes before 8 no votes within 30 days again. 
<br>
<br>
12. If you receive 8 no votes, you may approach an officer after 60 days to see if you are eligible to reapply.
<br>
<br>
13. Voting will begin after you have completed your 6 raids and will only last for a maximum of 30 days from time of application.
<br>
<br>
14. Once your 15 votes are received, you will be notified by an officer of your acceptance into the guild. If you were accepted, it is your responsibility to seek out an officer for an invite. If you were declined, we do thank you for your interest, and we are sorry that the voting did not turn out in your favor.
<br>
<br>
15. We require the Planes of Power expansion. Mainly for the raid manager tool, and the raid experience feature. 
<br>
<br>
As always, the leadership reserves the right to bypass any or all of these rules. At times the leaders will need to do what is best for the guild as a whole.
