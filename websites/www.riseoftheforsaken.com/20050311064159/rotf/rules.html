As a raiding guild the following guidelines must be used for the safety of all, and to insure a quality raid.
<br>
<br>
1. Show up 10-15 min. before posted raid time at the posted meeting spot, be there and ready to go. Don't make people wait for you.
<br>
<br>
2. Pay attention. At any moment a raiding force can move, jump into battle, or need your attention. Please inform group leaders if you must go afk.  Group leaders must keep the raid leader informed if any of your members go LD or AFK.
<br>
<br>
3. NEVER send a direct tell to a raid leader. They are juggling 20 things at once. Any questions or comments should be told to your group leader or an officer. They will keep raid leaders informed.  Continued abuse will be warned.  Repeated abuse will be grounds for guild removal.
<br>
<br>
4. Know your zones and mobs. Most prepared wins. If you don't know before a raid, search the web, or ask someone. Knowledge is key.
<br>
<br>
5. Know your class. We strive for smart players, not pure brute force. Knowing your class expectations in any given battle is key.  The raid leader should not have to tell you what to do in every instant.
<br>
<br>
6. “ASSIST” Always wait for the Main assist (MA) or Second assist (SA) to call for you to help on a mob. At any given time the MA and SA are deciding what mob to fight next, what mobs to unmezz, gaining taunt agro. Any jumping the gun can kill an entire raid.  No attack call means that the MA fights alone, period.  Always assist from behind the mob unless directed otherwise.
<br>
<br>
7. Please try to attend the majority of a raid.  All raids will have an estimated duration.  If you can safely join a raid after it has begun that will be your responsibility to get to us.  We cannot stop the raid to add each new person, but if you can get to us you are welcome to join.  If you must leave a raid early please plan for that in advance, i.e., bring gate potions, inviso potions, etc.
<br>
<br>
8. Keep raid channel (/rsay) clear for information. /rsay is to be used only by guild leader/officers, raid leader, group leaders and the pull team for raid instructions. Use the raid chat channel (that is set up at raid time), group, and say for conversations. Also, keep emotes and food/drink spam low on a raid. 
<br>
<br>
9. If you need a buff send a tell to the appropriate class.  Do not spam the raid chat for buffs.  Ask those that can do it or do without a buff.
<br>
<br>
10. Be patient. Sometimes a raid can be slow, or there may be a lot of deaths. Patience will help keep things moving along faster than complaints.
<br>
<br>
11. If there is a wipe get back to the raid zone as soon as possible.  This is NOT the time to go AFK.
<br>
<br>
12. All peridots, port stones, pearls for CoH and coffins will be supplied by the guild raid fund.  All guild members should work toward owning some sort of enduring breath item, don’t rely on others to keep you breathing.
<br>
<br>
13. Be ready for the CAMP! call. Never know when we will be in a spot where running/evacing can't be done because of logistics. So, when told by a leader to CAMP! All rezzer camp  without hesitation.  ALL MELEE must continue to fight to insure that at least one person who can rezz gets camped.  Good policy is to camp for at least 3 min.  You can also come back into raid chat with an alt. and check to see if its safe to log back in. 
<br>
<br>
14. Planes of Power raid feature will be used on ALL guild raids.  Therefore it is a requirement that all members have Planes of Power. 
<br>
<br>
All raid guidelines are just that, a guide. But, continually ignoring raid policies can be cause for a warning, and in an extreme case be grounds for removal. We want everyone to have fun, but also need to keep some kind of Order to have a successful raid.
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>

Loot Rule/Policy-
<br>
<br>
As a raiding guild we will need to keep a large raid attendance to accomplish goals. Thus, the system employed in Rise of the Forsaken is Merit.   
<br>
<br>
1. Merit means that a particular item has been designated for a certain guild member.  This item will not be /rolled on by raid members.  A merit decision will be decided at the time the item drops.
<br>
<br>
2. When asked to link an item for possible merit, please link the item to be replaced to the appropriate officer to be considered for the merit loot.
<br>
<br>
3. Pre-claimed means that a raid leader claims an item for a particular person at the time the raid is posted or announced.  No one else will get a chance to roll on this item.  
<br>
<br>
4. If no player is able to use an item or no one wants the particular item, the item will be placed in the guild bank for the use of other guild members.  
<br>
<br>
5. On class specific items, a player  who  previously won may or may not be given a chance to win this item.  This is the discretion of the guild leader.
<br>
<br>
6. If you go AFK while loot is being merited you will not have a chance at the loot.  DO NOT AFK at this time if you want to be considered for loot.
<br>
<br>
7. Once a loot decision has been made at a raid, it is Final.  There is to be NO discussion during the raids about any loot decision.  Save any comments or criticisms for the message boards or guild meetings.  Anyone continually abusing this rule will be removed from the guild.  
<br>
<br>
8. 2-box or dual-boxing (playing 2 characters at one time) is allowed.  Both characters are helping the raid and therefore should be allowed to be considered for loot.  Only one character can be considered for a merit per raid unless no other player is interested in a particular item.
<br>
<br>
9. Recruits are not eligible for loot at raids until they become a full guild member, unless no guild member needs/wants the item then recruits MAY be considered.  Sorry but we must think of current members first.  
<br>
<br>
10. If a player is pre-claimed an item they may be considered for other merits items as well prior to their pre-claimed item dropping.  Once the pre-claimed item drops that person cannot be considered for other merit items on that particular raid.
<br>
<br>
11. All merchant fodder and cash loot will go to the guild raid fund to help pay for peridots, pearls, coffins, portal stones, etc.  If you use these items at a raid please ask the guild leader for reimbursement after the raid is over.
<br>
<br>
12. Raid leaders/officers will be the looters for each raid. Items that are tradable will be held till the end of the raid.  NO DROP items will be announced.  You must link your item to the appropriate officer to be considered for an item.  Pay attention to the leaders for the loot drops and when you need to link an item.  If you are on an unannounced AFK you will lose out on loot, if you are LD we will attempt to wait as long as we can without the item rotting.
<br>
<br>
13. If anyone leaves a raid early, and something drops that they would have been merited, an officer will hold the item for that player in his/her bank.  
<br>
<br>
14. ANYONE can lead a raid.  Raid leader gains pre-claim rights.
<br>
<br>
15. All raids will use the above rules.  Any raid under any other rules is not considered an official RoTF raid.  Your attendance does not reflect on the guild or its loot and policies.
<br>
<br>
16. When upgrading items, members should consider the extent of an upgrade.  If an item is a small upgrade for yourself, consider passing on the item so someone that is lesser equipped may win.  “Share the Wealth.”  Be fair, not greedy, consider the stats and effects closely.  Don’t always ask for every item.
