<p align="left"><font size="4"><font color="#D0AC53">Hello,<br>
<br>
Rise of the Forsaken is always looking for good, smart, adventurous players. If 
you are looking for a guild that raids and groups together and treats one 
another as family and friends, this will be a good home for you. If you are 
looking to be in the Plane of Time as fast as you can, this will not be the 
guild for you. We are not an alt. guild, we are looking for players that will be 
committed to our guild.&nbsp; We are a &quot;Raiding&quot; guild, we raid 5-6 days per 
week, if you are online we request you join all raids.<br>
<br>
Presently Rise of the Forsaken is working on getting Emporer keys and collecting 
our shards, etc. to gain access to Vex Thal. We also will be taking down many 
named mobs in other zones (including Planes of Power) and raiding Ssra Temple 
for armor upgrades. As we level, upgrade armor and flag members we will continue 
working toward what is necessary to get our guild into the old world high end 
content and elemental planes. <br>
<br>
We do have a few rules for joining us, please read all rules/guidelines/polices 
on the main website

<br>
RotF is growing in leaps and bounds and it is important that we get to know you 
and you get to know us, this cannot be done in a few days.</font></font></p>

<br>
<br>
- Rules and guidelines for recruitment--</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">1. All petitioners must read the guild charter, 
policies, raid/loot rules, and merit guidelines on the guilds main page, agree 
to them, and adhere to them.<br>
<br>
2. You must be Level 60+ (unless you are a class that is presently has increased 
requirements).<br>
<br>
3. Your recruitment process will be for a minimum of 6 raids and will not take 
longer than 30 days. <br>
<br>
4. All recruits will be required to receive 15 yes votes before 8 no votes. 
Voting will not begin until the 6 raid requirement has been met. <br>
<br>
5. You will not become a full fledged member of RotF until you have completed 
the required flags, received your 15 yes votes, attended at least 6 raids and 
when the guild feels we know you well enough. You will be notified by an officer 
when you have reached permanent membership.<br>
<br>
6. Must have a current member sponsor you (if you do not know anyone in the 
guild, we will assign you a sponsor). Your sponsor must have been a member for a 
minimum of 30 days before they can sponsor you. It is your responsibility to 
talk to potential sponsors that will be listed on your application response.<br>
<br>
7. Keep in touch with your sponsor for upcoming raids/events that you can 
attend. Also try to group with guild members as much as possible. Let us see you 
and know you have a real interest in this guild. It is your responsibility to 
keep in touch with the guild.<br>
<br>
8. Contact any officer or your sponsor for the recruitment/alt. channel that is 
on at all times. Its a good place to find out what the guild is doing that you 
can join in on.<br>
<br>
9. During raids recruits will be tagged. Meaning you will get a guild invite at 
the beginning of a raid so you may interact with us through guild chat and be a 
representative of our guild. At the end of a raid you remove yourself from the 
guild. Guild chat is used a ton by our guild even during raids and this will 
give us as well as you an opportunity to get to know each other a bit more. This 
shows you are committed to us and lets everyone get to know each other. Please 
don't be shy, talk to us, let us get to know you.<br>
<br>
10. Please do not recruit our guild at the same time your are recruiting another 
guild. We want dedicated people to our guild.<br>
<br>
11. If your application expires 
before you have completed 6 raids and 15 yes votes, you may re-apply and go 
through the 6 raid process and 15 yes votes before 8 no votes within 30 days 
again. <br>
<br>
12. If you receive 8 no votes, you may approach an officer after 60 days to see 
if you are eligible to reapply.<br>
<br>
13. Voting will begin after you have completed your 6 raids and will only last 
for a maximum of 30 days from time of application.<br>
<br>
14. Once your 15 votes are received, you will be notified by an officer of your 
acceptance into the guild. If you were accepted, it is your responsibility to 
seek out an officer for an invite. If you were declined, we do thank you for 
your interest, and we are sorry that the voting did not turn out in your favor.<br>
<br>
15. We require the Planes of Power expansion. Mainly for the raid manager tool, 
and the raid experience feature. <br>
<br>
As always, the leadership reserves the right to bypass any or all of these 
rules. At times the leaders will need to do what is best for the guild as a 
whole.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guild Leader – Ovedia <br>
<br>
Officers: Gonn, Halik, Wrekk, Loladenx and Nrea</font></font></p>
