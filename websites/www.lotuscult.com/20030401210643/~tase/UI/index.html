<strong>TaseMix - UI Mod</strong>
<br>
<br>
My UI is heavily based off <a href="http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=438">Drakah's UI</a>. You may find you prefer that one rather than mine.
<br>
<br>
First off, the disclaimer: This is an <em>advanced</em> UI. It's also a very personalised UI - I customised it for my play style, and don't currently have any plans to make changes based upon user requests. Sorry.
<br>
<br>
I don't use the pet window at all, so it's been converted into a player stats window. Also, the timers are currently hard coded into the MP3 window and are not easily customisable. The skin is currently for 1280x1024 resolution only. The casting gauge appears underneath the mana gauge when a spell is cast.
<br>
<br>
You can view a screenshot of the skin <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/taseui.jpg">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
Generic info for installing skins can be found <a href="http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=9.topic">here.</a> Specific information, including how to install the INI file for correct window placement, can be found in the MUST_README.rtf file included in the main zip.

<TR bgcolor="#bfbfbf"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#800000">Minor Update: 25/2/03</font></strong></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>More updates for the LoY patch. Added new buttons to the group and inventory windows. I was unable to test the LFG button on the group window since I don't have LoY, but it should work.<br>
<br>
The full .zip files have <strong>NOT</strong> yet been updated, you can download a small patch (54kb) from <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/LoY_patch_250203.zip">here</a>. Unzip it into your existing directory and overwrite any files when prompted.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> If you downloaded the patch zip with only two files in it, you will need to download the newer one (~8:41pm EST) which includes window_pieces04.tga.

</TR></TD>
<TR bgcolor="#bfbfbf"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#800000">Minor Update: 7/2/03</font></strong></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Small fix to update the files they changed for the new expansion. Inventory now has the charm slot, and the window_pieces04.tga file has been updated to match the new one.<br>
<br>
The full .zip files have been updated, you can also download a small patch (30kb) from <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/patch060202.zip">here</a>. Unzip it into your existing directory and overwrite any files.
</TR></TD>
<TR bgcolor="#bfbfbf"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#800000">Update: 31/1/03, version 1.2</font></strong></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Just a few minor fixes and modifications.<br>
<br>
More timer options are now available.
<br>
<UL>
<LI>The default for the main UI is a set of generic timers (5, 25, 36, 60 minutes), also included is a set of timers for bards (36, 12, 1, 60 minutes). You will need to rename the EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd_Bard.xml file appropriately.
<LI>The melee UI has a set of timers suited to a monk/rogue as defaults (6, 36, 25, 60 minutes), also included is a set of timers for warriors (15, 3:30, 10:30, 7:48 minutes). You will need to rename the EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd_War.xml file appropriately.
</UL>
Unfortunately, you will need a seperate UI directory for each different set of timers you wish to use.
<br>
<br>
Some slight graphic changes to the MP3/Timer window.
<br>
<br>
Moved to a modified version of Keiz's buff windows. These feature a number down the side for each buff, the song window is positioned at the bottom and simply acts as buff slots 16 - 21. The old style buff windows are included if you prefer them, as EQUI_BuffWindow_Default.xml and EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow_Default.xml. Rename them appropriately if you wish to use the plain list style (without numbers, left-aligned, with borders) for your buffs.
</TR></TD>
<TR bgcolor="#bfbfbf"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#333333">Update: 9/1/03, version 1.1</font></strong></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>New version released, with a couple of minor changes. Pet window is back! Now appears as a tab behind the player stats for all those people who like using it. Also fixed a couple of small text alignment issues, changed the actions window slightly, and the melee version now sports a mend timer which may please some monks. The new short-duration buff window is also included.<br>
<br>
I haven't had a chance to test the new version much since the 9/1 patch (the live servers aren't even up as I write this), but there shouldn't be any major issues.
<br>
<br>
The caster and melee versions are now split into two completely seperate downloads. This makes for a little more download time, but it should be much easier to install (and maintain). They both include instructions for installing, so just pick the one you wish to use and download it.
<br>
<br>
<em>Edit: Yes, I'm Australian, so the dates are the right way round. For all you Americans, I mean the 1/9 patch.</em>
<br>
<br>
<B>Minor Update:</B> There is a new window_pieces01.tga file available for download <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/window_pieces01.zip">here</a>. This fixes the wrong colour bug with the tint selection window. Just extract the file to your mod directory and overwrite the existing file. This is not yet included in the full downloads, so you will need to grab it seperately.

<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
<TR><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Downloads:</strong><br></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
- <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/tasemix.zip">Full release</a> (1.9mb). The whole lot.
<br>
<br>
- <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/tasemix_melee.zip">Pure melee version</a> (1.5mb). Fills up the blank space where the spell gems usually are, and doesn't include some of the spellbook files since you shouldn't use them.
<br>
<br>
- <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeth/eqscreens/tasemix_graphics.zip">Just the graphics</a> (238kb). Buttons, window borders, new compass graphics, and background tile images. These should work fine with just about any mod. Based on t.king's stone background tile.
</TD></TR>

<br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<TH BGCOLOR="#ffffff">Changes from Drakah Mix, and credits:</TH>
<TR CLASS="graybg"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Inventory Window</strong><br>
Since I moved all the stats and resists off into the old pet window, I reclaimed the space from the inventory window. It's styled after the old layout of the inventory, with buttons moved around and a larger destroy button since I find myself destroying an awful lot of crap these days.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Mp3/Timer Window</strong><br>
The timers are courtesy of Arista, more info can be found at <a href="http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp">the UI Timer Homepage</a>. Since I could find no other way to get the timer window to stay up all the time, I attached them to the Mp3 player. While you can customise your own timers from the homepage, getting them into the Mp3 window can be a pain and is not recommended unless you know your XML.
<br>
<br>
The Mp3 player itself is a modified version of the Vert Mp3 player, rearranged to fit in nicely. You can find the original version <a href="http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=4226">here</a>.
</TD></TR>
<TR CLASS="graybg"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Player Stats Window</strong><br>
This is the old pet info window. HP/Max HP, AC, ATK, all stats and saves, plus weight are listed here.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Hotbutton Window</strong><br>
Added some more space for clickies, and made it a little wider to fill up empty space.</TD></TR>
<TR CLASS="graybg"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Spell Gem Window</strong><br>
Removed the permanent labels next to the spell gems. The tooltips that appear when you hold down ALT usually end up hidden behind other windows; hitting ALT-S twice can fix this but I find it only mildly annoying. Spell gems and the cast bar are courtesy <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10">t.king</a> and <a href="http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31">Remelio</a></TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Item Display Window</strong><br>
Added a Lotus Cult logo to the background. Most people probably don't want this, so deleting the EQUI_ItemDisplay.xml file will change it back to the default.</TD></TR>
<TR CLASS="graybg"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Tracking Window</strong><br>
Simplified tracking window, suited to a druid or bard. Rangers will likely prefer the default tracking window.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Buff Window(s)</strong><br>
Modified version of <A HREF="http://sleinad.homestead.com/files/KeizUI/KeizUI.html">Keiz's</A> buff windows. I stretched the blue/red backgrounds to fill the entire buff slot, and made them slightly wider.</TD></TR>
<TR CLASS="graybg"><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Compass Window</strong><br>
Small graphic tweaks to make the letters more visible.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Containers</strong><br>
<a href="http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31">Remelio's</a> container mod. This removes all the space between container slots, making it more difficult to accidentally move the container around. Large done button at the bottom, with the combine button appearing over the bag icon. You can move bags around by clicking between the minimize and close buttons and dragging.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="left"><strong>Spell Book</strong><br>
Is once again thanks to <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10">t.king</a> and <a href="http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31">Remelio</a>. More spellbooks are available on t.king's page if you prefer one of his other designs.</TD></TR>
