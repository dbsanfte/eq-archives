<B>Welcome to the Lotus Cult Treasure Hunter's Guide.</B>
<BR>
This is, and will probably always be, a work in progress. With the rate at which items in the game change and are added, it will probably always be lagging behind a little, although every effort is made to keep it up to date. This is not intended as somewhere for us to brag about mobs we've killed and loot we've looted - a lot of these mobs we haven't killed yet, and a lot of this loot hasn't dropped for us yet. The main use seems to be for people planning wish lists, or us as a guild planning what mobs deserve the most priority. It's also just fun to see what loot is in game currently.
<BR>
<BR>
A '*' next to an item means the stats may be slightly wrong (Please submit corrections for these items if possible).

If you have feedback on the guide, click the "Loot Guide Feedback" link up the top and let me know about it. If you see something wrong - an item with the wrong stats, an item listed under the wrong mob, or a mob that is missing an item from it's drop list, for example - then by all means pass the info along. If you have info on any recent additions to the game, the best way to submit them is with a screenshot. If you want to just send the stats along, please try and include ALL the stats - even those useless ones like weight, size, and recommended level.
