    <b>Two days of duplicity</b></font><br>

    Everquest massive patches provide us with one unwavering constant in this pixilated world: a subsequent repatch!  So, the last two days we spent running all around obliterating everything we could get our proverbial hands on before this morning’s patch.  Tuesday was fraught with depravity.  Our day’s onslaught commenced with sufficiency.  We cleared Sleeper’s Tomb and bejeweled Quizer with a primal 1hs, Lbas with a primal 1hp, <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50385">Mauleaur</a></b> with a primal 2hs axe (8 of 8 active paladins now primalized thanx to fortuitous 2h primal acquirement), and <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78663">Batuda</a></b> picked up a scroll for Primal Avatar.  We moved over to Kael afterwards to provide calamity unto the Avatar of War.  Given the presence of another guild taking on Derakor and Statue, our momentum repelled.   <br><br>

<p align=center>I think he was smiling seeing how few we had:<br> <img src="http://www.lotuscult.com/~quixotim/otherpics/aowsmiling.jpg"></p><br>

Our attempt ensued with 50 members providing 3 perfect tank changes and getting him to near 25% before he began tearing through us like razors into wet tissue.  We conducted the fastest CR ever but only got him to about 40% the second time.  Alas, this is exactly why I love this battle so much: one minute foible can waste an entire raid of 50.<br><br>

Wednesday proved to be quite antithetical to our effort’s the day before.  Not only did we easily best three notable emissaries of beguilement, but we obtained numerous new items yet to be acquired in our ranks.  The day began with a sforzando in the Plane of Growth, culminating with our second slaying of Tunare. <br><br>

Once again, our tactic here proved to be flawless.  Not a single death the entire fight, which objectively dissimilates her from her guards, thereby proving Guardian of Tunare > Tunare.  <br><br>

Among her hoard of duplicitous quality, only the branch was a repeat item for us.  <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1517">Pottz</a></b> disarmed Tunare of her dagger, <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=38537">Nilaaxe</a></b> unsheathed Tunare’s 2hs, Wynnter walked away with the new FT 5 shield, and Riptar captured the <b><a href="http://www.lotuscult.com/~quixotim/loot/sapencrustedbranch.jpg">Sap Encrusted Branch</a></b>.  Finally, Trabious was awarded the Breath of Ro!  <br><br>

Before you start to comment about how my next few picture are too dark, remember that all of these people I am showing are evil, and thus only hide in dark places!  Indeed, it could not be my complete ineptitude with taking pictures in EQ.  <br><br>

Next on the agenda was a short trip to Kael for another dethroning of its monarch.  The fight became interesting when the noble intentions of a Shaman incognito cast a few forays of Torpor on the main tank!  Agro was thrown amuck.  Nevertheless, we quickly regained control and obtained one of the better hauls from Tormax in some time (i.e., nothing rotted or went to alternates!).  <br><br>

The head for FT 2 booties was decapitated by Darkweb, <b><a href="http://www.lotuscult.com/~quixotim/loot/ringoflightning.jpg">Rings of Lightning</a></b> were awarded to Gompf and <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=76024">Shackmyn</a></b>, the <b><a href="http://www.lotuscult.com/~quixotim/loot/veliumencrustedgauntlets.jpg">Velium Encrusted Gauntlets</a></b> were bequeathed to <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2171">Quixotim</a></b>, and the <b><a href="http://www.lotuscult.com/~quixotim/loot/wristguardofthunder.jpg">Wrist Guard of Thunder</a></b> is now worn by <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13808">Colach</a></b>.  <br><br>

Upon our postmortem review of Tormax, our sleuths received word that Cazic Thule was not only up, but the rest of his minions were already absconded.  We quickly sent our troops in and, after the sacrificial killing of a paladin on the pull (despite the fact that he doesn’t Death Touch), we quickly thwarted his reign of Fear. <br><br>

We didn’t even believe the first person to inspect Cazic when she told us the two drops were a brain and robe.  We’ve never acquired the brain and only had 2 robes in our numerous Cazic onslaughts.  It appears as though the probability of these items dropping has increased, as the last 4 Cazics to fall on our server has dropped 3 brains and 2 robes.  The brain was awarded to the main who needs another brain more than any other, <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=68924">Dunze</a></b>.  <b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130166">Jaysoun</a></b> followed by dawning a new robe.<br><br>
