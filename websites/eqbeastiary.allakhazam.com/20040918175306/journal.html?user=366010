He started out as a Black Mage, but has switched to a Red Mage in his more recent incarnation.

Since the very beginning, however, Rentwokay has worked hard to become a Summoner.  That dream came true at the end of July 2004 when he dropped a seven-colored Carbuncle's Ruby in the center of the Stone Circle at the La Theine Plateau, after a two-hour cloaked march through the Beaucedine Glacier... horribly lost and without a map.

As time passes, new goals approach him.  He is awaiting the battles against the Prime Avatars when he reaches Level 20.  Naturally, the chance to summon Fenrir in battle would be his next challenge, but only Altana knows when and if that day will ever come.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center>

Sneak and Invisible made the travel much easier, but I had grown no more affectionate towards the annoying mobs of the icy island than they had towards me, and waiting until nightfall wasn't exactly a vacation from the nightmare.  Once the clock struck 22:00 and the sun disappeared over the horizon, I cloaked myself and walked down a narrow path towards the water.<br><br>An enormous <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/163.jpg target=akztarg>Kraken</a> was guarding the flowers.<br><br>No matter.  Fish monsters can't see through Sneak, and I had cast both Sneak and Invisible at the top of the hill.  It was simply a matter of walking behind the giant squid and taking the flowers.  That is... until a message flashed on the screen.<br><br><span style='color: Red;'><b>The effect of Sneak is wearing off.</b></span style='color: Red;'><br><br>EEP!<br><br>I ran back up to the top of the hill, just in time to see a Level 30 Warrior and a high-level Monk running down to the same spot.  The Monk made short work of the Kraken and I was free to take the flowers.<br><br>Three quick stops back in Jeuno: one to check on the man's son (who gave me a couple thousand gil and a Beast Whistle), one to stop by the Minstrel's Tavern (to hear about Song Runes in Buburimu), and the Chocobo Stables to check on the father himself.<br><br>After visiting the stables, the <b>Beastmaster</b> advanced job was unlocked.<br><br>In an attempt to conserve what little gil I had left, I made an effort to go on foot to Buburimu instead of renting a chocobo.  Sneak and Invisible made the journey easy, but it was no more enjoyable.  Walking three feet away from a high-level Raptor-type monster is not a pleasant experience, even if you know there's no way they will attack you.<br><br>From Sauromange to Meriphataud, then to Tahrongi and finally to Buburimu, I set my home point in Mhaura and got ready to hunt.  I had changed my subjob to Thief and was feeling the benefits of Treasure Hunter and Steal.  A handful of Sylvestres had already sacrificed a bunch of Saruta cotton for the benefits of my clothcraft skill, and one of these leeches was going to sacrifice a Carbuncle's Ruby for the sake of Rentwokay's future.<br><br>And just so there's no doubt about the effectiveness of Treasure Hunter, Buburimu was drowning in a deluge when I got there.  I spotted a Water Elemental roaming around the shore, and after a three-minute assault with Thunder spells, it dropped <b><u>THREE</u></b> Water Clusters, each of which sold later to Jeuno for 600 gil a piece.<br><br>I fought about a dozen Poison Leeches on my own.  One of them linked with a buddy right as a Bogy started attacking me, and I didn't make it to Mhaura in time without being slaughtered, so I waited for daybreak and set at it again.<br><br>This time, the beach was occupied with a Level 29 Red Mage killing leeches.  I asked if he was looking for a Ruby, and he said yes, but he would rather work by himself and get the experience as well.  Fine by me.<br><br>Before long, <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/164.jpg target=akztarg>Cirrus</a> joined the hunt, and he was more than willing to work together.  He was a Level 29 Black Mage with a well-leveled White Mage sub, and had no trouble healing while I supplied most of the damage.  Three leeches later, a Ruby dropped.  We lotted, and I doubled Cirrus' score.<br><br>I had my Carbuncle's Ruby.<br><br>The second ruby didn't come nearly as quickly.  After an hour of fighting Bogies, Leeches, and the occasional Clipper (Cirrus had a habit of using a weapon skill with a bit of splash damage), he had his Ruby, and we went our separate ways.<br><br>I marched triumphantly back to Windurst and brought the Ruby to the House of the Hero in Windurst Walls, where I was instructed to experience the seven colors of the rainbow.  A second stop to Vashal in Windurst Woods had me looking for the fang of &quot;the greatest of the toothed beasts.&quot;  There were a lot of quests on my plate at the moment, and I wanted them all completed.<br><br>I also became a Mentor.  Square-Enix allows Level 30+ characters with over 200 hours of playtime to become Mentors, which appear on a Mentor List for new players that need questions answered.  I was happy to donate my services.<br><br>The second week of Summerfest had begun, and like most people had predicted, <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/165.jpg target=akztarg>Goldfish Scooping</a> had been enabled in the wilderness around Windurst, San d'Oria, Bastok, and Rabao.  I took a shot at it.  Equip a free goldfish bowl in one hand and some paper scoops in the other, and start fishing in the river that cuts through East Sarutabaruta.  Catch enough fish, and you can trade them in for prizes.<br><br>Considering paper scoops are 100 gil a piece and the grand prize for scooping is a stack of <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/166.jpg target=akztarg>Spirit Masque</a> fireworks, I gave up rather quickly, even though my Lord's Yukata was helping my success rate quite a bit.<br><br>I logged off for dinner, and when I came back, I stepped outside Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods to see a cutscene of my ruby glowing yellow.<br><br>I had obtained the first element: clear skies.<br><br>When I crossed into Tahrongi Canyon, the scene cut away again to the Ruby glowing green.  Second element: wind.<br><br>Figuring Buburimu might be experiencing a little off weather, I decided to take a peek and see.  Sure enough, the Ruby glowed blue.  Third element: rain.<br><br>Back to Tahrongi and it was onward to the windy passageways of the Meriphataud Mountains, where the Ruby began to glow purple.  Fourth element: thunder.<br><br>I wasn't there long before reaching Sauromange, where I exploited Sneak and Invisible once again to take me to a hidden cave, where I watched an Old Sabertooth die.  Taking a large fang from a pile of bones around where his carcass lay, I had what Vashal wanted.<br><br>In the process, the wind picked up and dust clouds blew in all directions.  I quickly ran to the zone point, which prompted the Ruby to glow yellow.  Fifth element: earth.<br><br>I sidetracked over to Jeuno and dropped off the lyrics that I had copied from the Song Runes in Buburimu, and was rewarded with a chunk of gil and a reminder of the similar runes that existed in Valkurm.  I had seen these runes when I was a Level 15 Red Mage in a party on the secret beach, and knew exactly where they were.  However, I had other plans for the moment.<br><br>Crossing back through Sauromange, I went back to Meriphataud and walked to the far size where <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/167.jpg target=akztarg>Castle Oztroja</a> stood.  This was the stronghold of the Yagudo beastmen, and this is where I needed to go to finish Mission 3-1.<br><br>Oztroja wasn't exactly the most welcoming place in Vana'diel.  The walls were sparsely decorated and made entirely out of rock.  It almost completely blended in with the surrounding mountains, to the point where I almost didn't recognize it.  In fact, I would have wandered around for hours until I spotted the gaping maw it calls a front door.<br><br>The castle was deserted when I first walked in, and it was filled with a <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/168.jpg target=akztarg>dusty haze</a> that made everything difficult to see.  There wasn't a Yagudo in sight, but after a few minutes, dozens of torches were lit simultaneously, and hordes of Yagudo showed themselves.<br><br>When I heard that there'd be Yagudo, I was anticipating more necklace hunting, but seeing the sheer number of birdmen floating around made me resort to Sneak and Invisible once again.<br><br>Completing the mission was simple after that.  I found a small room, talked to one person, and made my way out of there as quickly as I could.  As I walked back across Meriphataud, the earth started to scorch, and I ran like the devil himself was chasing me in order to reach the zone and capture the sixth element.  Fortunately, I made it with seconds to spare.<br><br>Sixth element: heat.<br><br>Traveling to the far north is the only way to capture the seventh element, so I walked to Mhaura, took the boat to Selbina, and rented a Mog House in San d'Oria to collect myself.  Then, it was off to Ranguemont Pass.  Seeing that the area was populated with some weak bats and low-level Goblins, I wasn't worried too much, until I came to the &quot;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/169.jpg target=akztarg>trap door</a>&quot; that I've heard mentioned on a number of different occasions.<br><br>Step through it, and it will not open from the other side.<br><br>I was all ready to run right in with guns blazing until I saw a pack of Goblin Muggers and Leechers right on the inside, which prompted me to run back and use - you guessed it - Sneak and Invisible to safely navigate the dungeon.  I did not have a map, but just heading to the northeast was enough to bring me to my destination: Beaucedine Glacier.<br><br>The weather was calm when I first entered, but the ground and trees were covered in <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/170.jpg target=akztarg>white snow</a>.  The first monsters I spotted were high-level <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/171.jpg target=akztarg>Goblins</a>, followed by black tigers (which can outrun me in a heartbeat), flying eyes, and finally, Stone Golums, which shook the landscape as they walked and gave me the impression that they could kill me just by looking at me.  Every monster checked as &quot;incredibly tough&quot;, and I wasn't about to test the truth in that statement.<br><br>I wanted around aimlessly for a half-hour.  There weren't that many other characters around, and those that I spotted were alone.  On one occasion, I saw a Level 75 Black Mage fighting a black tiger.  And on another, a Level 75 Paladin faced-off with a Dark Elemental.  I told the linkshell as I spotted the gurus doing their business, and the response was, &quot;Where the Hell are you?&quot;<br><br>I was where Level 75 characters go to <i>farm</i>.<br><br>Mapless once again (not that the online map helped me much), I found myself going in endless circles, tracing cliffs and gorges, hoping to find a zone point somewhere, and wishing that I had waited for snow at the entrance.  The unfortunate truth, however, was that the only way out of Beaucedine was through.  The only thing I would find by backtracking would be the one-way trap door that led me here in the first place.<br><br>And then it started to snow.  Hard.<br><br>I ran scrambling for my Invisible macro and accidentally hit [Alt]-[Esc].  The game minimized, FFXI shut down, and when I restarted, the ruby shined with an indigo light.<br><br>Seventh and final element: snow.<br><br>With my quest nearly finish and all the elements collected, I shouted for teleports, warps, escorts, and pretty much anything else I could find.  I amazingly spotted a party of Level 55 characters taking on tigers, and I politely asked them for a Warp.<br><br>They didn't have a Black Mage.<br><br>As I walked away, one of them sent me a /tell that pointed me in the direction of the zone.  I found a long cave at the southernmost point in the glacier, and when I had reached the end of it, I was in Batallia Downs.<br><br>I had one stop left: the Stone Circle in the La Theine Plateau.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Wed Aug  4 14:35:36 2004 by ArTwoKay</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

I had as much fun with it as I can.  I ran between the decks almost constantly, <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/154.jpg target=akztarg>admiring the decor</a> and <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/156.jpg target=akztarg>talking with the NPC's</a>.  I <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/155.jpg target=akztarg>stepped outside</a> and looked at the scenery.  I recognized the Mea crag in <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/157.jpg target=akztarg>Tahrongi Canyon</a> as we flew over it.  In my excitement, I started talking to the other players.<br><br>&quot;This is my first airship ride...&quot; I said.<br><br>&quot;Don't worry. You'll be ok,&quot; came a response.<br><br>As a joke, I emoted that I got airsick over the side of the ship.<br><br>&quot;Just wait until the Air Horror shows up... It's like Level 75+++.&quot;  The Air Horror is a non-existant notorious monster, a spoof on the Sea Horror that appears occasionally on the ferry from Mhaura to Selbina.  A character that can solo it is truly a master of the game.<br><br>Nevertheless, I decided to play along.  &quot;I may be new, but I'm not a noob.  I know very well that the Air Horror is only Level 60, and it drops the Godly Plate of the Whale.&quot;<br><br>A few people laughed.  &quot;Heh, I like this guy...&quot;<br><br>The ride only lasted five minutes before we arrived in Kazham.<br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/158.jpg target=akztarg>Kazham</a> is the Mithra homeland.  It's their paradise, and those Mithra who are born there are never allowed to return after they leave to live on the mainland, most likely in Windurst.  The only non-Mithra NPC's in Kazham are either travelling salemen or missionaries.<br><br>But as far as the city itself, it's very different from any other place I'd seen before.  There's color everywhere - bright green leaves, pink flowers, and sparkling blue water.  While the village itself is smaller than even Selbina, it has such a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Compared to the overcrowding associated with Jeuno, this was a more welcoming home-away-from-home than that which I had to endure when I was leveling in Qufim.<br><br>A <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/160.jpg target=akztarg>Nomad Moogle</a> was stationed outside a few small shops, allowing me to check my Mog Safe, change jobs, or receive deliveries.  No gardening options, however, which meant that if I wanted to check on any of my three pots, I had to go back to Jeuno to do it.  This was an unfortunate necessity because crystal stacks and gardening were my only two sources of income in such a remote location.  On the upside, Kazham had a chocobo rental location and <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/159.jpg target=akztarg>an Auction House satellite</a> linked to the nation that was in control of the region at that time.<br><br>And wouldn't you know it... it happened to be Windurst.<br>With five more levels until hitting the crucial Level 30 milestone, waiting for a party was a painful affair.  The secret to any success I had was writing a search comment that mentioned how I was willing to be the main healer.  In the first party I joined, I used what I learned in Qufim to give Regen priority over Cure II when it came to curing people.  Amazingly, everything held up extremely well as we fought Yuhtunga Mandragoras in the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/161.jpg target=akztarg>Yuhtunga Jungle</a>, to the point where the party leader sent me a private /tell message to let me know I was doing a good job.<br><br>I reached Level 26 on my first night in Kazham and learned the Cure III spell.  Though I could never use it in a party situation because of the immense amount of hate it draws, I knew it would be helpful in solo situations.<br><br>On my second day in Kazham, I passed the party-waiting time by browsing the Auction House for gear and spells I could use at Level 27.  Enwater was an option, but considering there were no fire-based enemies in the area, it would be a waste of money.  I spent my hard earned cash on a new set of body armor and matching cuisses, which gave my defense a nice boost.  The next party I found <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/162.jpg target=akztarg>didn't need me as a healer</a>, since they had a White Mage, and as they chained monsters in the nearby Yhoator Jungle for 200+ EXP a piece, it wasn't long before I was wearing that new armor.<br><br>I took a break for dinner and came back later on that evening with my seek flag up once more.  I passed the time by traveling into the deeper areas of the Yhoator Jungle in search of the fourth crag crystal.  The thought of being able to get to Kazham from anywhere in the world (as long as there's a high-level White Mage around) was a nice idea.  There were tons of large and frightening monsters about, but Sneak and Invisible proved I had nothing to fear, and I got invited to a party on my way back from the crystal.  They got me to Level 28 in no time at all.<br>Things fell apart on the third day.<br><br>This is when the downsides of the Outlands started to show their face.  Both the Yuhtunga and Yhoator Jungles are strewn with tunnels, connecting small clearings of land above ground.  Since the tunnels themselves are not shown on the map, the entire area is a maze.  Taking what looks like the most logical route may only lead you deeper into oblivion.  &quot;Oblivion&quot;, in this case, could be the mouth of an Overgrown Rose (a Malboro-type monster), the blade of a horrific Goblin Smithy, or the heart of Ifrit's Cauldron.  Yes, hard to believe the very soul of Ifrit was hidden on this island somewhere, and that means I'd be back to Kazham one day to face off man-to-man with the Prince of Flames once I became a Summoner.<br><br>The parties started to decrease in quality as well.  Between deaths by aggressive monsters, Goblin chains, poor healing, poor hate control, and innumerable other acts of carelessness, getting to Level 29 and learning the Thunder spell took much longer than I had hoped, especially considering I had planned on reaching Level 30 that very evening.  But one group had to stop and heal after every fight because they only had one person who could Provoke, and hate bounced around like a pinball.  Another group had no damage dealers - two Paladins, a Ninja, a Thief, a Samurai, and myself.  Though it would be possible to nuke monsters with Blizzard or Thunder, they needed me as the primary healer.  Chaining monsters for 200+ experience was an impossible dream.<br><br>To make matters worse, even though Yhoator Jungle is desolate during the afternoon hours, it gets crowded at night, with parties fighting right on top of one another.  This leads to people catching area-of-effect attacks from monsters that other parties are fighting, like the Mandragoras' sleep attack or the Goblins' bombs.  Both could lead to a party's dissolution if no one is careful, but considering the elitest nature of a number of people who play the game, nobody's willing to move.<br><br>One party disbanded only to be reformed again under a different - and less qualified - leader.  I quit without a word and took up a healing post in another party, which displayed the same slow, chain-free behavior of the previous groups.  Out of sheer frustration and with 3000 EXP until Level 30 - complements of a number of unnecessary deaths - I went to bed.<br><br>I was saved early the next morning by an amazing party that put even my first Kazham parties to shame, made up of some Japanese and some Americans working together in tandem.  And quite well, in fact.  We had a White Mage to handle healing.  We had both a Ninja tank and a Paladin tank, plus a Ranger to handle damage dealing.  I handled enfeebling and elemental nuking.  And most importantly, we had a Bard, which kept accuracy-boosters and damage-boosters on all the melee fighters, and MP regen and elemental-boosters on all the mages.  By stacking HP regen songs between fights, downtime was reduced to nearly nothing, and the only tough spot came when we decided to take on a Worker Crawler, which took out our Bard in a handful of hits.<br><br>But, when you have a Level 29 White Mage in your party, you have an always-available source of the Raise spell.<br><br>With the chains, the teamwork, and the speed that this group displayed, it wasn't long before I reached my goal.<br>That morning, I reached Level 30.<br><br>The gates of Vana'diel were now opened to me, as well as the opportunity to start each of the advanced job quests.<br>It would not be long before I became a Summoner.<br><br>So, with an EXP buffer of about 2000 points, a small amount of cash from selling crystals, and all the determination a little Tarutaru mage could ever handle, I returned to Jeuno.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Tue Aug  3 10:31:43 2004 by ArTwoKay</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

Fortunately, one can buy an airship pass that only permits travel between Jeuno and Kazham for a fraction of the price of a complete pass.  The unfortunate truth, however, is that price is still more than I could ever dream of seeing at this point in the game.<br><br>The alternative - and, in general, the most widely used means of obtaining a pass - is to find three chest keys: one from Giddeus (the Yagudo outpost outside of Windurst), one from Ghelsba (the Orcish outpost outside of San d'Oria), and one from Palborough (the Quadav mines outside of Bastok).  All three are rare drops, and obtaining them without any sort of help is both very time consuming and extremely difficult.<br><br>The logical thing to do in this situation would be to set Thief as your subjob, and use Treasure Hunter to increase the drop rate of the keys.  Unfortunately, as a Level 25 Red Mage, my subjob caps at Level 12, and Treasure Hunter only becomes available at Level 15.  I could get my Thief to Level 25, but that was a time commitment I was not willing to make.  I had to do things the hard way.<br><br>Since my home nation is Windurst and I can never have too many Yagudo Necklaces, I decided to make my first stop in Giddeus.  It took me a reasonably long time to find where the high-level Yagudo that drop the keys spawn, but once I got myself situated and set up camp, I soon realized that I was more than capable of soloing them one at a time, if I allowed myself time to heal after two fights.  It wasn't the most efficient way of going about things, but nobody in the area seemed to be hunting keys at that time.<br><br>I killed a handful of them.  Necklace drops were rare, which was disappointing, as were crystal drops.  I had a feeling the only reward I would be getting from this chain of battles was the key itself, and nothing more.<br><br>At that point, a Level 24 White Mage showed up and started camping in the same areas.  I politely asked her if she was hunting for keys, and when she said yes, we partied up and started hunting together.  Within three battles, the first Giddeus chest key dropped, and I very generously told the other mage that it was theirs.  And we continued the fight.<br><br>The sector soon became very crowded.  A handful of higher level players starting camping the same monsters, awaiting the spawn of a notorious monster in hopes of farming and selling the rare item that it drops.  When they got bored with that, they started collecting cheap items from all the other adventurers in the area, hoping to set the bait for another monster - one that they were claiming would kick both their tails even if they worked together.<br><br>Their antics stirred up quite a bit of trouble.  With them focusing on the bait and not enough on the monsters, it was more common for links to occur, and us two mages would be fighting off more than one Yagudo at one time.  I tried to Sleep them whenever I could, but considering the convoluted control scheme in the PC version of the game, this didn't always work out so well.<br>Fearing that I was going to get myself killed because of the inconsideracy of these two show-offs, I said goodbye to the White Mage, and logged off.  I came back the next day to an empty sector, and got the key to drop within ten fights.<br><br>Since Bastok is my personal favorite of the four main cities, I decided to go to San d'Oria next.  Getting to the spawn point for the right Orcs was a very long hike, and unfortunately, the strength and defense of Orcs outmatch that of the Yagudo, so fights were much more difficult.  Even worse, Orcs tended to spawn two at a time right next to each other, so attacking one usually meant fighting two or three.<br><br>I found a personal sweet spot.  At the zone point between Fort Ghelsba and Yughott Grotto, I camped out.  Two Orcs would usually spawn in a nearby hut, and once I finished them off and healed, a handful would spawn inside the entrance to the grotto.  Rinse, repeat, wipe hands on pants.<br><br>And even though this system made finding the monsters easier, it did not make the fighting any easier or faster.  The process grew increasingly frustrating, which is why I found myself making occasional trips back to the city to participate in Summerfest quests, Eco-Warrior trips, or Garrisons, just to break the monotony.<br><br>The next day, I found a Level 25 Thief (with Treasure Hunter) to party with, and it made the fights go much easier.  Still no drop after a half hour's work, however.  That's when he called in his friend - a Level 37 Thief - to help us out even more.  We fought in the same two areas as I had the day before, but an hour's work produced nothing, save for a handful of shaman garlic, which the other Thief needed for a quest.  He left soon after that, but the high-level Thief agreed to help me until I found a key.<br>That's when the competition started getting fierce.<br><br>Almost instantly, Yughott Grotto filled with a variety of high-level and low-level characters fighting the same Orcs, looking for the same keys.  Other than being crowded, however, there was no shortage of Orcs for everyone to fight, and everything was peaceful.<br><br>Eventually, though, Orcs started spawning more slowly than they originally had, and finding one that could drop the key was taking longer and longer.  Two competing characters - a Paladin and a Black Mage - started making comments about myself and my assistant, saying we didn't know how to just stay in one spot.  It was a stupid statement because waiting at a single spawn point is both inefficient and pointless.  He would much rather have us camp so he could run around and take everything that we couldn't reach.<br><br>The boiling point hit, however, when my Thief initiated battle with an Orcish Cursemaker in the corner of one room.  I ran up to help him and start swinging when another Cursemaker comes up from behind me and starts attacking.  Without a second's thought, I cast Sleep on it so it would stop, and go back to fighting the first Orc.<br><br>At that moment, I see the Paladin off the corner of the right side of the screen.  He had been hoping to claim the monster that was attacking me, and out of frustration, he says, &quot;stupid fags stole my mob!!&quot; and runs back to his partner in crime.<br>I don't really want to go into detail about what happened next, but it was a shouting match between my Thief and the two other high-level characters.  The word &quot;fag&quot; was said about fifty times.  I ended up disbanding out of sheer frustration and embarassment for the sake of my generous assistant, and proceeded to wait out front and solo like I had the day before.  The Paladin made sure to not let the issue drop, however, and slapped me on the way out.<br><br>I do what I can to avoid scuffles like this because I want to avoid having a negative reputation.  I don't scam people.  I be generous when I can, as long as the other person isn't a Level 1 character who just doesn't want to do the work themselves.  But this was the first time I became the target of such hostility, and it really stuck with me.  I decided to walk back to San d'Oria and take another break.<br><br>Figuring this key hunt was fruitless, I took what little gil I had and spent the majority of it on a chocobo ride to Jeuno, walked dejectedly - so dejectedly, in fact, I accidentally zoned into <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/151.jpg target=akztarg>Ru'Lude Gardens</a> on the other side of the city - into Qufim, and put up my &quot;Seek Party&quot; flag.  I wasn't the only Level 25 character in Qufim, but in general, leveling there after hitting 25 is fruitless.  Within a few minutes, a Level 40 Dark Knight messaged me, asking if I needed help getting keys, and I reluctantly accepted, explaining what had happened the day before.  He called upon his friend - a Level 38 White Mage - to teleport us to the La Theine Plateau, where we got chocobos to take us back to Ghelsba.<br><br>We fought one Orcish Serjeant, and it dropped the Ghelsba chest key.<br><br>Apparently, this particular Dark Knight is very lucky with drops, and he told me stories about how he got lucky with his keys and has been helping others for a while.  We rejoined the White Mage and teleported to the highlands outside of Bastok.  The Dark Knight gave me gil to rent a chocobo, and we rode to the Palborough Mines.<br><br>While the Palborough chest key drop wasn't nearly as magical as the Ghelsba drop, it happened after about eleven battles with Quadavs.  After thanking the two profusely for their help, they teleported me to Tahrongi Canyon, and wished me luck in Kazham.<br>Without bothering to stop in Windurst first, I rented a chocobo and rode to Jeuno.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Mon Aug  2 16:00:14 2004 by ArTwoKay</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

In BCNM battles, a player trades those ever- plentiful Beastmen's Seals for orbs, which are used to trigger capped battles against special notorious monsters, allowing them to win rare items that can't be found anywhere else.<br><br>Garrison is the third of those battles.  Each one of the three home cities has a special item associated with it that drops from monsters inside the beastmens' outposts.  Trade that monster to the outpost closest to that city, and Garrison will start.  The entire alliance is capped at Level 20.  A number of ally NPC's will charge out onto the field, followed by three waves of high- level beastmen.  Together, your party/alliance and the NPC's have to fight off the beastmen.  Keep the NPC's alive until the end of the final wave, and you win gil, Dragon Chronicles Pages, and special Garrison gear.<br><br>I had often mentioned that I wanted to try one of these battles; not necessarily for the rewards, but for the experience (not to be confused with EXP).  I enjoy doing Eco-Warrior quests with large parties, but they get repetitive.  And it's true:  they are extremely easy with a full alliance.<br><br>So as I was waiting to do another Summerfest quest, somebody /shouts that they're looking for Garrison participants.  I sent them a /tell explaining my job and equipment, and I was invited to the group.<br><br>I quickly bought some lizard armor and head out to the outpost.  Eventually, we had a full alliance of eighteen people waiting in West Ronfaure.<br><br>Garrison's biggest issue of late is people trying to scam others out of items.  <br>Some people switch the item distribution scheme to Quartermaster and take all the loot for themselves.  Other people lot when other's aren't paying attention (in the heat of battle, for example, when the chat log is clogged), and end up walking away with full pockets.<br><br>This group made the rules very clear.  Anyone who lots before the battle is over or before the item-trader takes his pick of one item from the pile, is promptly booted from the party.<br><br>When the battle started, the lag was ridiculous.  Macros weren't working properly, and the abundance of character models (and Summerfest fireworks) on the screen at once slowed the action to a crawl.  We got through the first round, and some idiot decided to lot.  He was booted.  Two more people lotted saying &quot;it's not fair that he lotted and we can't&quot; and they got booted as well.  <br>Finally, one more person tried to lot after the second wave showed up.  He was eliminated from the group.<br><br>Now, while this was a good idea in theory, our 18-person alliance was now four people short, and the second wave was quite difficult.<br><br>I was one of the many casualties during that round, and while I had set my homepoint to the outpost where the battle was taking place, I couldn't get the level cap back, meaning I couldn't fight any of the beastmen, and I couldn't heal the NPC's or allies.<br><br>The alliance was a skeleton crew by the end of the second wave, and it didn't take long for the last wave of beastmen to finish off the few remaining NPC's.<br><br>The party was left with three pairs of mannequin feet - a part required for the very popular &quot;It's Raining Mannequins!&quot; quest, which rewards players with a mannequin on which they can display a suit of armor in their Mog House.  The parts can only be obtained from Garrisons or BCNM battles, and therefore, can be sold for upwards of 40 K gil.<br><br>And yes, I wanted a pair.<br><br>The item-trader got his after a huge amount of whining, which left everyone else yelling about who should get to lot for the remaining feet.  As the arguing continued, fate stepped in and automatically distributed the items without any lotting.<br><br>My eyes widened when I checked my log:<br><b><span style='color: Yellow;'>Rentwokay receives </span style='color: Yellow;'><span style='color: Green;'>a pair of mannequin feet</span style='color: Green;'><span style='color: Yellow;'>.</span style='color: Yellow;'></b><br><br>Everyone pretty much gave up at that point.  Seeing how the alliance was in such disarray, nobody wanted to sacrifice their item for a second go.  But one person - Yumie - didn't like who got the loot.<br><br>She started sending me /tells, telling her - with no good reason - to give up my &quot;boots&quot;.  She didn't stop until I finally explained to her that I followed orders, I did my part in the battle, and most of all, I lost 500 EXP to a death that was the result of no one provoking the beastmen off the mages.<br><br>And with that, I disbanded and rejoined the Summerfest activities.<br><br>The next day, I was riding into West Ronfaure on my chocobo (on return from Windurst), and I saw a large crowd of people gathered outside the outpost.  <br>Figuring it was Garrison, I pulled up beside them and asked if they needed a Red Mage.  After speaking with the alliance leader, I was welcomed into their group.<br><br>This Garrison went smoothly, as did the item distribution, for the most part.  <br>The handful of people that died lotted for the Dragon Chronicles pages, and those that didn't discussed the distribution of the remaining items.  Having my own set of mannequin feet in storage back in Windurst, I passed on all the other pairs so someone else could have them.<br><br>And once again, as the distribution discussion continued, fate distributed the loot.  And amazingly, the Garrison Tunica landed in my stash.<br><br>I heard a couple of &quot;you lucky bastard&quot; remarks after that.<br><br>I logged off to decrease my graphics settings, but when I got back online, no one was there, either because they gave up on Garrison for the day or they had moved on to another city.<br><br>The Garrison Tunica didn't seem like all that exciting a piece of armor.  It had the same defense as my Lizard Jerkin, but added a point to Dexterity and Charisma, and was usable by all jobs.  Since DEX and CHR aren't that useful for a mage, I decided to throw it up on auction.  So I checked the price history in the San d'Orian AH, and...<br><br>The three previous Garrison Tunicas had sold for 100,000 gil a piece.<br><img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/jawdrop.gif><br><br>Considering the most gil I ever had at one time was about 22 K, I understood where those &quot;lucky bastard&quot; comments were coming from, and posted it.<br><br>I did Garrison twice more that weekend, both times with the same alliance.  My Tunica hadn't sold yet, so I decided to wear that to the event, and it garnered the attention of a Black Mage named Omegabahamut.<br><br>The first was particularly special because I was joined by <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/150.jpg target=akztarg>Beavnuts</a>, one of the flagship members of the Forum Central linkshell.  We had bumped into each other earlier and taken screenshots, but now we were fighting alongside each other.  It was a cool moment.<br><br>We lost the first attempt, and no items - not even mannequin parts - dropped during the battles.  Out of sheer frustration, someone traded a second time and we gave it a second go.  This time, however, I died towards the middle of the third wave when - once again - no one would provoke the mobs off the mages.  I was chased around by an Orcish Chasseur until one arrow brought me to my doom.<br><br>On the upside, some mannequin parts did drop.  I passed on the feet, and lotted for the legs, but I came up about 300 points short of the highest lot.<br><br>Omegabahamut, on the other hand, missed his mannequin feet lot by less than five points, and he didn't feel like going home empty handed.  He offered me 10 K for my Garrison Tunica.<br><br>Now, I'm not a sucker, and I reminded him of how it sells for 10 times that at auction.  His response was that Hoohoo (another alliance member) bought his from our White Mage for 20 K.  I humored him and told him I wouldn't sell it for any less than 40 K.<br><br>He offered me 10 K in gil, a Composite Fishing Rod (worth 12 K), and his Fisherman's Tunica (worth 8 K).  Not willing to make an enemy and drooling over such high quality fishing equipment, I accepted, and we both walked back to San d'Oria.<br><br>I knew something was up because he told me to wait by the Auction House for about a half hour as he got everything together.  Out of frustration, I mentioned that if he had won the mannequin legs, I would have traded for those straight up.<br><br>Oooh, he liked that idea.<br><br>He ran around San d'Oria for another half hour looking for a pair of mannequin legs.  He had one potential trader that backed out on him, and then tried dragging his friend over in hopes of making the trade.<br><br>I asked him at one point why he wanted the Tunica so badly, figuring if he just wanted to sell it, I was going to walk on the deal.  He mentioned that he had a Ranger, and he would appreciate the stat boosts.<br><br>All this nonsense for +1 to DEX?<br><br>I had a feeling I was getting the bum end of the stick, and I thought hard about continuing in the transaction.  In the end, I said to myself that mannequin legs sell for 45 K a pop, and it's ultimately the same as having my pick of the loot from the Garrison where I won the Tunica in the first place.  I would have easily taken the legs, even if the Tunica is worth more.<br><br>Omegabahamut finally found a pair, and we made the trade.  He ran away screaming &quot;OMG I LUV YOU,&quot; and I left San d'Oria for Ghelsba.<br><br>One part of me has a feeling that I'm going to be browsing the Auction House one day, and I'm going to see that he sold them.  I accidentally bumped into him in Windurst - he was still wearing his original Black Tunic that he wore to the Garrison - and asked him how the armor was working out for him.  He responded with &quot;My NINJA is doing awesome!&quot;<br><br>Funny.  I thought it was for your Ranger.<br><br>In any case, I was looking in Jeuno one day for new armor, and I noticed that the MSRP for the Tunica had dropped to about 80,000 gil.  Again, another point that makes me feel better about the trade.<br><br>Nevertheless, I have two mannequin parts in storage, and enough beastmen's seals to get the other three, if I wanted to, plus the experience to someday organize my own Garrison in Windurst.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Thu Jul 29 17:05:55 2004 by ArTwoKay</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

So grab a bag of popcorn and start reading.<br><br><br><br><b>San d'Orian Eco-Warrior</b><br><br>I mentioned in my last update that I had tried the Eco-Warrior quest in San d'Oria, but I didn't go into much detail about it.  Whereas the Windurst quest takes place in the depths of the Maze of Shakhrami, the San d'Oria quest takes place in <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/117.jpg target=akztarg>Ordelle's Cave</a>.  The rewards and restrictions are the same: win the final battle with a cap at Level 20, and you get a random amount of experience from 500-1000, and 5000 gil.<br><br>The final battle, however, was much easier than its Windurstian counterpart.  Instead of fighting three Wyrmflies at once, we fought one huge <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/118.jpg target=akztarg>Necroplasm</a>.  In this fight, the person most in danger is the player who actually triggers the monster's release.<br><br>Regardless, the monster <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/119.jpg target=akztarg>went down hard</a>, and in typical Eco-Warrior fashion, everyone got excited and split up.  I spent the entire journey back running from bats that linked like crazy all the way to the exit, with me stuck in my sub-Lv20 gear.<br><br>I ended up getting 991 EXP from that fight.  Extremely tasty, if you ask me.<br><br>I didn't mention, however, that I ended up doing the quest <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/135.jpg target=akztarg>a second time</a> a week later.  While this party was more organized during the actual fight, they ran into problems on the way back.<br><br>One high-level player recruited a number of Tarutaru to help him fight on the way back.  It wasn't long before he sent me a /tell.<br><br>&quot;I need a healer. Disband.&quot;<br><br>I thought this guy was an ass, taking one of the three healers all to himself, so I sent an apology to the alliance leader, and joined his party... with a way to get him back in mind.<br><br>We walked back, and this guy pulled no punches.  Every monster in sight decided to aggro him, which left me in charge of healing.  I was patient, though, and I held out long enough before yelling out...<br><br>&quot;WAIT!&quot;<br><br>...and silently activated a Scroll of Instant Warp from my inventory.<br><br>At about 80% casting time, I used the &quot;wave goodbye&quot; emote and was transported instantly back to San d'Oria.<br><br>And there he sat with his Taru minions with his level capped, without a healer.  He would either have to risk death to get to the exit, or wait for the rest of the group.<br><br>That quest got me 737 EXP, 5000 gil, and an immeasurable amount of satisfaction.<br><br><br><br><b>It's Not Easy Being a Thief</b><br><br>Being a Thief rocks until about Level 7.  The fast attack speed, the Steal ability, and the increased amount of gil dropping (thanks to the Gilfinder passive trait) adds up to a very rewarding experience.  I spent most of my time outside San d'Oria in <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/120.jpg target=akztarg>West Ronfaure</a> doing my leveling.<br><br>Plenty of rabbits to drop rabbit hides and from which to steal carrots, which I use to level my cooking skill.  Funguars drop <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/132.jpg target=akztarg>Dark Crystals</a> which sell for over 300 gil a piece.  <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/123.jpg target=akztarg>Orcs</a> and Goblins drop cash.  Worms drop flint stone.  Everything had a purpose - whether it be to make a bit of money, raise my crafting ability, or use personally.<br><br>Once you hit Level 7, though, Wild Rabbits and Tunnel Worms stop dropping crystals and the EXP stops flowing.  You have to move up  to tougher enemies, which are more likely to beat you without a second thought.  Sheep and <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/122.jpg target=akztarg>Hounds</a> are the worst suspects.  They'll put you to sleep and beat you to a bloody pulp without you being able to do anything about it.<br><br>Having Red Mage as a subjob doesn't help either, but being a Tarutaru was the worst handicap of all.  Still, <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/121.jpg target=akztarg>leather gear</a> beats having to walk around with one of those cheesy subligars.<br><br>The climb to Level 9 was a tedious one, and once I got there, it was time to start looking for parties.  Those that wanted to fight in La Theine or Ghelsba were promptly liquified by enemies that we just weren't prepared for.  If a low-level Thief gets invited to a low-level party, it's a sure sign that the leader is just inviting anyone willy-nilly.  Well, the first party I was invited to had three Thieves in it.<br><br>I read in a guide on Allakhazam that the secret to being a tasty Thief at low levels is your Archery skill.  I had toyed with Archery with my Red Mage, but it was usually <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/124.jpg target=akztarg>just for fun</a>.  With my Thief, I got serious.  I picked up a bow and some cheap arrows - nothing special - but my ranged attacks still managed to do over three times the damage of my melee attacks.  My skill rose quickly, and the fights became easier.  Eventually, it was time to head to Valkurm.<br><br>Dunes are the magical happy land of noobs everywhere; I knew what to expect at this point.  It was a long wait before I started getting invites, and even then, they weren't high caliber.<br><br>One party was going particularly well until the level spread got too large, and the party leader booted the poor guy without warning.  Everyone screamed at him for his rudeness, and he responded by dissolving the party and running into a train of Goblins, where he met his demise.<br><br>He was the first - and at this point, <i>only</i> - person I ever blacklisted.<br><br>The last party I ever joined in Valkurm had me pulling as my primary function.  I set up a few really good macros, and ended up snagging some good monsters.  The EXP was delicious until we had to start finding replacements for disbanding members.<br><br>By that point, I had taken my fill of Zulkheim and Ronfaure.  I wanted to head back to Windurst and try leveling in more familiar areas, like Tahrongi and Shakhrami.<br><br>After visiting my Mog House and doing some housekeeping, I marched back to Tahrongi with new stacks of arrows and enough determination to carve marble.  A decent party picked me up and brought me to the far reaches of the canyon, where we could easily pick off Wild Dhalmels and Yagudo mages.  This is one of the few times I got a chance to see how awesome a Dragoon's pets can be.<br><br>Mmm... <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/125.jpg target=akztarg>Flame Breath</a>...<br><br>With one level left until I would gain Treasure Hunter, I made a very greedy purchase.  I picked up a Self Bow +1 - a rare high-quality synth that hadn't been available at the Auction House until that day - and two stacks of Iron Arrows.  This bow was the most expensive purchase I had ever made: a greedy 15,000 gil.  But it was worth every penny, even though I would only use it until one level.<br><br>The next party called me to the Shakhrami Maze to snipe some worms with them, and that's where I learned the value of a good Archery skill.  My damage was matching that of the melees, and I was out of the Worms' spell range.  I was untouchable, as long as the worms didn't link.<br><br>Before long, I reached Level 15, and politely gave my warning that I was going to leave soon.<br><br>However, one of our tanks decided it would be a good time for him to leave as well.  Instead of doing the right thing and walking back to Windurst, he broke the cardinal rule of Final Fantasy XI and attacked a bat.  Every bat in a 10-mile radius came swooping down to suck his blood, and he keeled over almost immediately.<br><br>He said he wanted to die.<br><br>But what he didn't plan for was what the bats did next.  The half dozen packs that he had angered started to head right for me and beat me senseless, with no chance of making it to the zone in time, I used Perfect Dodge - the Thief's 2-hour ability that dodges every physical attack without fail - but it didn't trigger in time, and I died.<br><br>I leveled down, disbanded, and soloed the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/129.jpg target=akztarg>lesser monsters</a> until I gained back the necessary experience, and soon enough, I got that level back that was stolen from me by a stupid Galka and some bats.<br><br>In addition to Treasure Hunter, a Thief learns an ability called Sneak Attack, in which the next attack does modified critical damage to the enemy... as long as you're standing behind the target.  I didn't think anything of it.  A critical damage usually only increases my damage by 50%; at the very most, it will double.<br><br>So I walked up to the unsuspecting Canyon Rarab, hit my Sneak Attack macro, and WWHAAAAHAM!<br><br><b>Critical hit!  Rentwokay deals 122 damage to the Canyon Rarab.</b><br><br>I just stood there and looked at the log for a second before moving on to my next fight.  It was the most damage I had ever done in all the hours I had played the game.<br><br>And, though I had a hard time believing it, it was hard for me to hang up my Dagger and move back to my Red Mage.<br><br>As a nice little reward for my efforts, the 15K Self Bow +1 re-sold to the Auction House for 18K; a nice 3,000 gil profit.  It doesn't cover the cost of all the arrows I used, but it was still very appreciated.<br><br><br><br><b>More Missions</b><br><br>Between leveling, I decided to take a break and attempt a mission I had accepted by accident.  In &quot;A Testing Time&quot;, you have to walk to Tahrongi, kill as many enemies as you can, and walk back within one hour's time.<br><br>People loathe this mission.  I originally got to skip it because I turned in crystals religiously, but then I accidentally accepted the mission after defeating the Dark Dragon.  Oh well.<br><br>Long story short:  I ended up killing 22 monsters, and that includes making it back to town about ten minutes early.  You can't stop the mission until the professor says so, meaning I had to <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/130.jpg target=akztarg>wait patiently</a> and do nothing until the clock struck 0:00.<br><br>No reward for my efforts.  Gee, thanks.<br><br>Mission 3-1, on the other hand, is unskippable and very popular.  Someone once told me not to attempt it until Level 25, but that doesn't mean I couldn't be briefed....<br><br>The gate guard sent me to Heaven's Tower - the most sacred area in Windurst - where I was to speak with the guards of the Star Sybil; essentially the Queen of Windurst.  I'd seen some really beautiful areas and <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/131.jpg target=akztarg>devices</a> that I'd never been exposed to before.<br><br>My mission involves heading to the Yagudo stronghold in the Meriphataud Mountains.  Without Sneak and Invisible, it would be a very tough mission indeed, but I'm confident that I will handle it when the time comes.<br><br><br><br><b>Vana'diel's Colorful Characters</b><br><br>I had an interesting welcoming committee on my way back to Jeuno.<br><br>I decided to take the long way through Selbina so I could drop off some millioncorn and another clay tablet, and there were a handful of characters on the boat.  One didn't say much, but he was sporting some of the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/127.jpg target=akztarg>coolest armor</a> I've ever seen.  Needless to say, he was a Dark Knight.<br><br>And then, there was <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/128.jpg target=akztarg>Zelda</a>.  I'm very envious of people who get good character names before everyone else, without having to resort to being called Squalll or Tiddus.<br><br>There's about twenty different variations on the name &quot;Sephiroth&quot; in practically every server.<br><br>On my way to get a Chocobo, someone shouted that they spotted a notorious monster named Steelfleece Baldarich at position (I-9).  Just out of curiosity, I checked my position, and - sure enough - I was at (I-9).<br><br>I turned around and he was standing there in all his <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/133.jpg target=akztarg>gargantuan glory</a>.<br><br>Right after I took that screenshot, the bum started charging at me so fast, the screen was shaking.  Literally.  His first hit dealt over 250 damage, and the second finished me off.<br><br>Not cool, you stupid sheep.<br><br>On a number of occasions, I went to Buburimu Peninsula to farm Sylvestres for Saruta cotton, which I need for crafting and gil.  Apparently, a Red Mage in artifact armor had <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/134.jpg target=akztarg>a similar idea</a>....<br><br>Any confrontation with Fenrir is a welcome one, but to get six inches away from the beast and take a <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/126.jpg target=akztarg>screenshot</a> is very satisfying.<br><br><br><br><b>The Last Days in Qufim</b><br><br>With my days as a Thief a memory, it was time to move back to leveling my Red Mage, and not a moment too soon.  It had been too long since I was in a party doing something that I felt was substantial and important.  And even if it required that I return to Qufim, it was still an anticipated venture.<br><br>Like I used to do, I sat inside the entrance to Qufim leveling my Enhancement skill until I received an invite.<br><br>This group was parked near Delkfutt's Tower in a small valley between two ridges.  From this position, we could see the tower looming in front of us and the ocean behind us.  It was there that they proceeded to brief me.<br><br>The party was made up of two Ninjas (one of which was the leader), a Ranger, a Black Mage, a Warrior, and myself.  Not a traditional group, by any means.<br><br>The party leader addressed me.<br><br>NIN: &quot;Ok, Rent, you're essentially going to be our main healer.&quot;<br>Me: &quot;Not a problem by me.  I've been the main healer before.  I know what I'm doing.&quot;<br>NIN: &quot;Yea, well, I don't think you've ever been a healer in this sort of party before.&quot;<br><br>He was right.  I hadn't.<br><br>NIN: &quot;It is imperitive that you keep Regen cast on us at all times.  Only use Cure if our HP is in the red.  And only use Cure I.&quot;<br>Me: &quot;In that case, give me a minute to set up some macros.&quot;<br><br>A primary healer that doesn't use Cure?<br><br>NIN: &quot;Also, try to keep the mob paralyzed at all times.  Don't spam it.  Just once at the beginning of each battle.&quot;<br><br>So I needed to be in control of three spells: Paralyze, Cure, and Regen.<br><br>NIN: &quot;What's your Enfeebling at?&quot;<br>Me:  &quot;Capped.&quot;<br>NIN: &quot;Nice...&quot;<br><br>They started by pulling a Clipper.  As soon as the crab showed up on screen, I'd hit my Paralyze macro.  Once the melees were engaged, I cast Regen the second their HP took even a tiny hit.  The battle was over almost instantly.<br><br>NIN: &quot;Pull a Pug!&quot;<br><br>The Ranger returned with a Pugil this time, notorious for their high attack power and Screwdriver attack, which can nearly kill any tank with one use.  That's about the time I noticed what made this party work so well and why I only needed three spells to support the entire group.<br><br>In this case, the Warrior was not the main tank; it was the party leader, who used a combination of the Warrior's ability Provoke and the Ninjitsu spell Ichi to cast Blink on himself.  Provoke adds a large amount of hate to your character, making the mob attack you, and Blink absorbs physical attacks for one or two possible hits.<br><br>The high evasion of a Ninja makes it difficult to hit.  Add Blink, and you have a one-hit buffer.  Add Paralyze, and there's a chance (a rather large one at that, thanks to my prudence with my Enfeebling skill) that the mob's attack will fail.<br><br>In the event that the Ninja - referred to as the &quot;blink tank&quot; - took a hit, the Warrior would use Provoke, and the Ninja would recast Ichi, which has a rather long cast time.  Once casting was complete, he would Provoke the monster back and resume his original role.<br><br>This party's morale was enormous.  We were chaining up to five monsters at a time for 200+ EXP a piece.  The Warrior knew when to Provoke.  Paralyze was sticking <i>hard</i> and stopping three attacks at a time, on some occasions.  The puller never had to zone.<br><br>At one point, we were so excited, the puller came back with a Giant Ranger.  That was a bit on the tough side.  Paralyze wouldn't hit as well, and he even came after me at one point.  But we still beat him, and the puller was ready for another pugil five seconds afterwards.<br><br>In about an hour and a half of fighting, I surpassed Level 24 and stopped 400 EXP short of Level 25.  I learned the Blizzard spell.  We only had to stop to rest on two occasions, and one of those times was so the Ninja could buy more powders for his Ichi spell. Part of that was due to the Refresh-inducing orange juice that I had squeezed in Windurst that same day at the Cooking Guild, but most of it was because of Regen, which refills almost twice the HP of Cure II over time for a fraction of the MP cost.<br><br>And about Cure... I only had to cast it <i><b>twice</b></i> the entire time I spent with them.<br><br>Partying with them was an incredible learning experience.  They were a prime example of where planning and organization can take you if used properly.<br><br>The next day, I needed to find a party to take me to Level 25, and it didn't take too long.  These guys were unfortunately the opposite of the Ichi group from the night before.  When I asked them if they wanted me to heal, nuke, or enfeeble, they said they wanted me to do all three.<br><br>When I mentioned how it might be better if everyone had a set function, the party leader rattled down how the Paladin is the &quot;tank and damage-dealer&quot; and the Black Mage is &quot;nuker and back-up healer&quot; and the White Mage is a &quot;healer and enfeebler&quot; and goes on and on... While some combinations either made sense or were completely inherent (the Paladin's obviously going to be dealing damage as he tanks), it was ridiculous how he was making all of us multi-task.<br><br>I didn't last long in that group.  I hit Level 25, built up a small EXP buffer, and summoned a replacement.  And with that, I head back to Windurst, having met another crossroads and learned the Invisible spell.<br><br><br><br><b>Summerfest 2004</b><br><br>On July 23, Square-Enix started another world event called Summerfest to celebrate the departure of spring and the coming of the new season.  They had a similar celebration last year, but this is the first time both Americans and Japanese are able to celebrate it together.<br><br>I was abnormally excited about the whole event.  When I joined FFXI there was a world event going on celebrating the second anniversary of Final Fantasy XI.  Moogles were placed by every city exit where they distributed free fireworks and a number of other items every hour.  I ended up with a handful of Crackers and a certificate to hang in my Mog House.<br><br>Summerfest was a bit more emmersive, though.  Every night, the skies of the three home cities and their surrounding areas were lit up by <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/137.jpg target=akztarg>fireworks</a>.  The background music would change to something noticably more Asian sounding.  Bazaars would open up selling their own items so people could participate in the fun.<br><br>The highlight, however, was the Mog Quest.  Party up with someone who's of a different race or gender.  Talk to the Moogle in the city, and he'll teleport both you and your partner to a high-level dungeon with a permanent version of <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/136.jpg target=akztarg>Sneak and Invisible</a> cast on you, as well as a Glyph from the city of departure.<br><br>Oh, and most importantly, you are capped at Level 1.<br><br>The object is to find a GoalPoint somewhere in that dungeon.  Since most of the areas to which you are teleported have a very maze-like nature, this is not always an easy task, especially since most characters who do the quest don't have the required maps to navigate properly.  But once you do find the GoalPoint, you have to de-activate your invisible status, activate the GoalPoint, and another Moogle will pop up and give you an item unique to your gender/race combination.<br><br>The whole &quot;de-activation of Invisible&quot; thing is where most people run into trouble.  A number of monsters in these dungeons won't hesitate to pound on a Level 1 character when they're about to get their item, and much <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/138.jpg target=akztarg>death and destruction</a> will ensue.<br><br>If both you and your partner survive, you can use the Glyphs to teleport back to the city.  You and your partner trade the items that you received from the Moogle, trade them to the first Moogle, and you're rewarded with an <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/139.jpg target=akztarg>Onoko Yukata</a>, a set of Level 1 body armor with 1 point of defense that looks pretty spiffy.<br><br>If you repeat the quest four more times (sporting your new Yukata is required), you get a Lord's or Lady's Yukata (depending on your gender) which is a different set of Level 1 body armor with 2 defense that increases &quot;goldfish scooping&quot; skill.<br><br>As of right now, nobody knows what that means.<br><br>If you still have the urge to do the quest a few more times, the Moogle will reward you with Festive Fans, Summer Fans, or Chocobo Tickets.  The fans are technically &quot;fireworks&quot; but they're just paper fans that you hold in your hands and wave around as you walk.  Chocobo Tickets, on the other hand, give you free chocobo rides.<br><br>I was addicted to Summerfest for the first few days.  I'd be running back and forth <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/147.jpg target=akztarg>from San d'Oria to Windurst</a> for a number of reasons, and each time I did, I'd send out a /shout looking for someone to party with.  Getting the Lord's Yukata was a bit of a headache, though, because it came down to me needed either a Female Hume, Female Elvaan, or Galka - arguably, the three rarest character types.  I ended up paying one Galka 3000 gil to do the quest with me.<br><br>I made all that money back, though.  Without thinking, I stuck the fans and tickets in my bazaar for 200 gil and 500 gil, respectively, and everything would sell out within a half hour.  40 fans * 200 gil = quite a bit of cash, especially when you add in the money I made leveling my White Mage between quests.<br><br>And it was fun.  I'm sure we could all think of better things to do than just running around looking for a spot on the ground, but it was really interesting to see where I may be fighting or questing.  I got to see quite a few cool monsters including a Cactuar-type notorious monster called <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/140.jpg target=akztarg>Sabotender Sediendo</a>.  My female Tarutaru partner - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/141.jpg target=akztarg>Pichenotte</a> - ended up being Quebecoise, and we spoke French to each other throughout the quest.  And there was no shortage of <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/142.jpg target=akztarg>freaky gadgets</a> to keep me curious.<br><br>About those <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/143.jpg target=akztarg>fireworks</a>:  you either love them or you hate them.  In any case, if you want to participate, there are a few NPC's running around that will sell some you can use yourself.  Unfortunately, the results <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/145.jpg target=akztarg>aren't nearly as dramatic</a>.  I usually would activate a firework, and then just sit there for few seconds wondering, <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/146.jpg target=akztarg>&quot;That's it?  I paid 100 gil for that?&quot;</a><br><br>The other big annoyance about Summerfest was the lag.  Before Summerfest, the most people I had ever seen logged into Seraph at one time was about 3200.  During Summerfest, we had about 1000 more logged in at peak times, and the lag and <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/144.jpg target=akztarg>congestion</a> were horrendous.  In many cases, I would have to wait for people in my party to show up on screen for more than 30 seconds.<br><br>The rumor going around is that Square-Enix will introduce goldfish scooping for the second half of Summerfest, which begins on July 30.  I agree with that theory, though it will be interesting to find out what the developers' real intentions are.<br><br><br><br><b>Digiko</b><br><br>Another Forum Central member decided to jump on the bandwagon and start a Final Fantasy XI character.  Digiko is a Mithra Thief that lives in Windurst.<br><br>She was half the reason I was running back and forth from San d'Oria so much.  I had to do <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/148.jpg target=akztarg>the Summerfest quest with her</a> on one occasion.  I had to give her a linkpearl on another occasion.<br><br>Dare I say it, but she already seems addicted to the gameplay.  She chats it up on the linkshell quite often.  She enjoys being a Thief.  And she's already lusting after lots of nice equipment.<br><br>But she can be a little careless at times...<br><br>Digiko doesn't understand why it's important for a Thief to use a Dagger instead of a sword.  She doesn't sell items in stacks to the Auction House.  She goes back and forth between levels multiple times when she doesn't gauge an enemy properly.<br><br>And all this would just be dismissed as a typical case of newbyism, but when the linkshell tries to help her, she just dismisses it, pulls out her sword, sets up her bazaar, and heads off to Tahrongi Canyon at Level 7.<br><br>Things will be interesting once she reaches the Valkurm Dunes.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Thu Jul 29 15:57:31 2004 by ArTwoKay</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

The Summoner quest will require me to fight specific enemies over and over again, and I need them to drop a specific item. I do NOT want this to be a repeat of all that magicked skull nonsense, so I'm taking a step in a preventative direction.<br><br>I did the Eco-Warrior quest a second time last night, this time in San d'Oria. Overall, it was a much more successful affair than the first time I did it. From the moment I was invited to the moment I received my reward, it all took about two hours total.<br><br>I had to buy some older gear since I would be naked when the Level 20 cap went into effect, but it was all quite cheap, and I got back my money 100%. Out of an 18 person alliance, only one person died on the way there, and the final fight - a giant blob-like creature that I took a screen cap of, but never uploaded - was a piece of cake. I used Chainspell and was put on enfeeble duty.<br><br>The way back was another story... Out of that 18 (now 17) person alliance, all but 6 died on the way back, the victims of aggro monsters and poor teamwork. The three party leaders made it out scoff free, though, as did I. If there was one major turnoff about the whole ordeal, it was the fact that the lead organizer would scream like a bitch whenever someone stepped out of line. &quot;DO NOT GET THE OIL! GOD!&quot; Always in all caps, always in bold.<br><br>I showed him up, however, when my Dragon's Chronicles gave me 991 EXP out of a possible 1000 EXP, in addition to 5000 shiny gold.<br><br>Finally, I scored the PC version of the game. DaHeiRen decided to abandon Seraph in favor of Odin, where most of his friends from home play. But he's debating starting a Thief character in Windurst, and he may decide to join the server then.<br><br>So what does the PC version mean?

On Saturday night, I ended up in an <i>amazing</i> party. You know a party is good when you get over 200 EXP a fight, and thanks to skill chains (and magic bursts, compliments of yours truly), we were able to link Clippers and Pugils like nobody's business. I'm a few battles a way from Level 24.<br><br>Level 23 brought with it the Blink spell, which - for those of you non-classic FF fans - makes a duplicate image of your character. The monster tries to attack that thing instead of the real you, and you take no damage from a physical attack. The thing disappears after you're hit once, but it's still a cool spell. You never know when you might need that 30 HP that the previous enemy robbed from you.<br><br>I've posted pictures of Relic gear before, but considering how Red Magey I am, I figured I'd post a picture of a Tarutaru wearing the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/113.jpg target=akztarg>Red Mage Relic Gear</a>.<br><br>Then, some more big news.<br><br>Out of nowhere, I get an IM from my old roommate that he had JUST BOUGHT FFXI AND WAS GOING TO MAKE HIS CHARACTER AFTER WORK!<br><br>AWESOME! I scrambled out of Qufim and back to Jeuno. I needed to get him a World Pass, but nobody sells them in Jeuno. And I couldn't ask him any more details about his character because he was at work. So I did some housekeeping until he got back.<br><br>When he did, he told me that he wanted to be a melee character, &quot;no spell casting.&quot; Fine. But that's all he knew. No idea what race he would be, what city he would live in, or what job he would choose. On a gamble, I rented a chocobo and decided to head of Bastok, home of the prime melee race - the Galka.<br><br>I took the route out of Rolanberry Fields, which eventually leads to the Konschadt Highlands, and from there, you can go to Bastok or Selbina. I went through a few areas I'd never been to before, and saw some <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/114.jpg target=akztarg>powerful-looking enemies that traditional FF fans will recognize</a>.<br><br>That's also about the point that DaHeiRen came to his final character decision. I gave him a rundown of the five races and the advantages to each city. He decided he wanted to be a Thief, and I told him Mithra make the best thieves. He was excited until I told him that all (playable) Mithra are female, and decided to reconsider.<br><br>He then decided to become a Monk, and I told him that Galka make the best Monks, to which he said &quot;THOSE BIG HULKING THINGS??&quot; I told him that Elvaan are the second-best, and that finalized his decision. He would be a male Elvaan living in San d'Oria.<br><br>At that, I made a hairpin turn at the Dea telecrag, went through Valkurm, to La Theine where I feared my chocobo was running out of gas. I decided to set him free after I found another stone monument, and proceed on foot for the rest of the way.<br><br>I picked up his World Pass immediately, which left me with a few more options as to what to do. I was well aware that installation and updating of Final Fantasy XI takes a very, VERY long time after a fresh install. I wanted to be in town so I could give the dude a linkpearl, and I didn't feel like making the long trek back to Qufim when I knew I'd be back so soon.<br><br>I decided I was going to San d'Oria and start leveling a new job. My initial decision was to work on my White Mage - the last of the three colored mages and one of the most sought after jobs in the came. But then, I did a complete 180....<br><br>The Thief class has an invaluable skill at Level 15 called Treasure Hunter, which increases the rate at which monsters drop items. It's so important because it makes farming much more efficient, which allows you to get gil extremely quickly. Not only that, but a Thief learns to Steal at Level 5. Around Windurst, in particular, there's a number of enemies that have valuable drops and/or steals. I've already mentioned the amazing demand for silk threads from Crawlers, something that Treasure Hunter could help substantially. And Mandragoras can have Saruta cotton stolen from them, which would help me with my weaving skill.<br><br>Both my inventory and Mog Safe are completely filled at the moment, and all my Level 1 Tarutaru gear is back in Windurst in Storage, so I had no way of accessing it from San d'Oria. I ended up selling all my Black Mage gear to make enough room for the Thief gear. I don't really mind selling it. The great part about the Auction House is that you don't lose money from buying and selling back, unless the price goes down for a particular item. More often than not, you end up making a profit.<br><br>So out with the Linen, and in with the Bronze. And suddenly, all those things I said about Locke looking gay came back to haunt me...<br><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/115.jpg target=akztarg>We've moved from gay porn to gay midget porn.</a><br><br>In all the time I've spent with FFXI, I've never experimented with a melee class (other than the Red Mage, obviously, which really doesn't count). Lemme tell you why I like my Thief. They attack ridiculously quickly. For every two Red Mage attacks, I'd get about three Thief attacks in the same window. And each of those attacks is much more powerful. Not to mention the high evasion rate, the prowess with ranged weapons, and the slightly heavier armor.<br><br>I raised my Thief to Level 4 extremely quickly. It's weird not having a basis in magic, but I think I can handle it, if it means killing twenty enemies in a row without healing, something my Red Mage can only dream about.<br><br>I'll continue with the Thief until DaHeiRen gets his act together, and then I'll head back to Qufim, with Level 30 in my sights.</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

They were incredible. Low downtime, high difficulty... and the Summoner actually used Ramuh on a regular basis in battle.

Nobody knows what they're doing, there's Gobs everywhere, the easy monsters petrify you, and there's no nice scenery. The only thing good about it is that there's Fire-element weather every once in a while, for those of us who need to charge up our Carbuncle Rubies.<br><br>Let me get this entry underway, and I'll elaborate.<br><br>This is mostly going to be a picture post because - while a lot has happened - not much of it is something I can write about. I do have highlights, though.<br><br>Everybody in the game hates Valkurm with a passion, but I, myself, put the Shakhrami Maze at the bottom of my list. Enemies get too difficult too quickly. The place is too crowded. It's gloomy. And at low levels, you sit around nuking idiotic Maze Makers that can't even move and spawn so rarely, you'll go insane.<br><br>I wanted to get done with that place as soon as possible. I joined a bunch of terrible parties that got me to Level 12, eyeing Level 15 with a passion. One rather successful party, however, was started by this dude Godzillla. He mentioned that the Lizards in Valkurm are actually a perfect level at this stage, and since everyone's busy with flies and pugs out in the main area of Valkurm, rarely anyone takes on the easier enemies near the entrances.<br><br>So the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/100.jpg target=akztarg>two of us</a> head to Mhaura. And my unlucky day began. My Carbon Rod broke, taking with it my 2000 gil Sabiki Rig, and someone pulled up a monster that killed me in one hit. The one person with Raise charged me 500 gil to get me moving again, only to be killed a second time after taking two steps outside of Selbina. And since I had forgotten to set my home point, I spawned back in Windurst.<br><br>Lovely.<br><br>So I was trapped in the Maze again. To help me cope, I developed an emote that makes me look like I'm <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/101.jpg target=akztarg>kicking</a> the other people. Oh, yea. I was a favorite.<br><br>I saw <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/102.jpg target=akztarg>two White Mages in relic gear</a> sitting in Windurst, and figured I'd take a picture. All I can think of is Strongbad saying &quot;There is two of usssss...&quot;<br><br>Long story short. Went to Valkurm. Was the best damn Black Mage you've ever seen. Reached Level 15. Shopped in San d'Oria for some spells. Changed back to a Red Mage. Headed back to Jeuno.<br><br>Now, Anik hates Valkurm. So does everyone else.<br><br>But my God... <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/103.jpg target=akztarg>Qufim</a> sucks.<br><br>I thought it was cool that I finally found a place that had snow in it, but that's where the novelty ended. Qufim is an island connected to Jeuno by an underground cave, which is shown in the picture above. 90% of the monsters aggro, and 90% of them link, which makes even the walk from Jeuno a difficult venture. Aside from the multitudes of crabs, goblins, worms, and skeletons that I've grown accustomed to, Qufim has lots of new enemy types.<br><br>Like Weapons.<br><br>And <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/104.jpg target=akztarg>Giants</a>.<br><br>On the upside, it's pretty easy to figure out when a Giant is chasing you because the <i>screen shakes</i>.<br><br>My first Qufim death was supplied by one of these big green giants. Never mind the fact that I'd never even fought anything yet and already I was dead. Never mind that I was stuck in the most rag-tag party ever assembled. I was walking around Jeuno... naked.<br><br>The death had de-leveled me to Level 20. Since my armor was mostly Level 21, I was walking around in a white t-shirt. It took three sweaty battles with worms for me to get the necessary experience back, and after that point, my party was so repulsed with themselves, they just disbanded. Good riddance.<br><br>Finding a party is extremely difficult in Qufim, unless you're a Paladin or a White Mage, both of which are in short supply. In an unbelievable stroke of luck, Yawgmoth - the guy who put together the EcoWarrior quest a few weeks ago - found me, gave me a linkpearl, and called upon me when one of their Red Mage's disbanded. I was saved! An easy 1000 EXP, and I went to bed.<br><br>The next day, I decided to keep myself busy as I waited with my party flag up. I head back to Batallia Downs and killed some more of those Stalking Saplings that kept me busy during the chocobo quest. Eventually, I was picked up by a group.<br><br>Now, <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/105.jpg target=akztarg>these guys</a> knew their stuff. We fought for hours. I gained about 3500 EXP and stopped a couple hundred short of Level 22. One new party finished the job and sent me on my way to Level 23, but exhaustion got the better of me, and I went to bed.<br><br>I'd been jumping back and forth between the FC linkshell and Yawgmoth's linkpearl to engage in some friendly conversation. It ended up being profitable. For 11 rabbit hides (about 100 gil a piece), 3 beehive chips (about 100 gil a piece), and 200 gil, he offered to build me a Bronze Bed (about 7000-8000 gil). The Bronze Bed is a piece of furniture that you stick in your Mog House, and it reduces the amount of experience that you lose when you die. Additionally, it triggers a quest that you use to increase the amount of storage space in your Mog Safe. Nice!<br><br>He also sent me a message in the middle of the night when he needed a Red Mage again, but I was fast asleep.<br><br>And I'll close with some more summoned monster pictures...<br><br>Some high level Summoner parked himself at the entrance to Qufim and just started practicing his summon skills. I jumped at the opportunity to take some close up shots... but this guy had quite the collection.<br><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/106.jpg target=akztarg>Ramuh</a><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/107.jpg target=akztarg>Titan</a><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/108.jpg target=akztarg>Leviathan</a><br><br>I also got a picture during my lunch break of the most powerful summon in FFXI as of yet, but that one will have to wait until the next update.<br><br>And despite my better luck later on in my travels, I still hate Qufim, especially since it's yet another obstacle standing in the way of Level 30.</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

There's still only four people on the linkshell so far, but that will change if those pearls start getting handed out like hotcakes.<br><br>I also mentioned how I was doing that clay tablet quest. One of the more difficult tables is obtained in North Gustaberg, but you have to go through an expansion-only area called <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/092.jpg target=akztarg>Dangruf Wadi</a>. And I thought Valkurm had lots of Goblins... There were plenty of Ambushers and Butchers early on, which are no longer anything to get excited about. But when the mobs turned into Leechers and Muggers - in groups of two or three, no less - I started to get nervous. I managed to take them out one by one until one Mugger decided to aggro and chase me away, with a friend that decided to tag along. There is a geyser near the exit that you have to stand on, and it will throw you onto a ledge. With the Goblins a few steps away and no MP to cast Gravity, I shot upward, and right after I hit the ground again, I had Sleep cast on me. I rotated the camera and hoped that the Goblins couldn't ride the geyser, but alas, they could. I was killed two steps away from the exit, and decided to abandon the tablet quest until I could get some more fame in Bastok.<br><br>Monsters may be cute and fuzzy from a distance, but get up close, and they're <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/092.jpg target=akztarg>freaky looking</a>.<br><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/094.jpg target=akztarg>This</a> is Rentwokay doing his Legolas impression. Even if it only does about 15 damage, I still think using a bow is cool.<br><br>I figured the only way I was going to get anything done around here is to advance a few levels. Despite Anik's advice I had volunteered to help out a party doing Mission 2-3, but they were looking for straight Level-25 characters, and I was 4 levels short. I figured I'd run to my Mog House, change into my Black Mage gear, ask for a Teleport-Mea to get me to Shakhrami in about three seconds, and find a party to kill some worms.<br><br>But right as I entered the Markets, I saw another shout looking for Mission 2-3 party members. I sent them a message, and after a quick check, I was added to their party.<br><br>The party was only three people strong at that point, and finding new members was slow. I organized my Mog House, did a tiny bit of fishing, and spent my savings on some new armor. Rentwokay is starting to look <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/095.jpg target=akztarg>slightly diesel</a>.<br><br>There was a lot of disagreement over who could participate in this mission and who could not. Some people said anyone could do it, regardless of nation or rank. Other people thought you had to be Rank 2, and you could not be from Bastok. This slowed down the process quite a bit, but our final party had six people: <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/097.jpg target=akztarg>one Warrior (tank), one Monk (damage dealer), one White Mage (healer), two Red Mages (enfeebler, damage dealer), and one Thief (hate control)</a>.<br><br>The Palborough Mines is located off of North Gustaberg and is a concentrated dungeon of Quadavs of varying levels. Then, you get to the third floor, check your map, and notice that a huge chunk of it is burned off. Get to that spot, and you find the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/096.jpg target=akztarg>Burning Circle</a>.<br><br>Time was of the essence (one party member had to leave). We all stood on the Burning Circle, and once we were fully healed, we activated it.<br><br>Cutscene. Two rangers from Windurst have a showdown with what is, essentially, a boss monster called the Seeker, which looks like a floating eye. The Seeker taunts us and summons *gulp* the DARK DRAGON.<br><br>When the cutscene was over, we were inside a battlefield. Looking around showed us that only FOUR of the six had made it through the Burning Circle. Two people - the White Mage and the Thief - never made it through. The four of us stood there for a minute, and basically decided - extremely hesitantly - that we were going to try.<br><br>Two Red Mages, one Warrior, and one Monk walked towards <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/098.jpg target=akztarg>an open room at the end of the battlefield</a>. Standing in it were the Seeker and the Dark Dragon.<br><br>And the fight began...<br><br>The other Red Mage cast sleep on the Dark Dragon to put it out of commission for a while. I cast Silence on the Seeker, but not before he could cast some nasty status effect on our tank. I wasn't about to waste my MP on this loser, so I ran up to it and meleed it until he died.<br><br>We sat down and waited for the dragon to wake up. It didn't take long.<br><br>The Warrior provoked it, drawing the hate towards him. The Monk used his two-hour ability - Hundred Fists - to continually hit the dragon. The other Red Mage started hitting it with a barrage of status effects.<br><br>But me... It was time for me to break out the big guns. I used my two-hour ability: Chainspell. Repeatedly cast spells with no delay.<br><br>Gravity. Bio. Fire. Fire. FIRE. FIRE. FIRE. FIRE! I lost control, and pelted the dragon with everything I had. And he... was... PISSED. He lumbered right over to me, and before I knew it, my camera had shifted, and I was between his legs. The message &quot;Rentwokay has been drawn in!&quot; appeared on the screen, meaning I was essentially on my own.<br><br>I tried as hard as I could to cast Cure II on myself in hopes of surviving, but before long, I had drained all my MP. I screamed for a Cure, but the other Red Mage just looked at me and said &quot;no ren&quot;.... I was killed about 5 seconds later.<br><br>And that's when I got a look at <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/099.jpg target=akztarg>the massive beast</a> that I had been fighting...<br><br><img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/yikes.gif><br><br>I watched the fight. The Red Mage was out of MP (explaining why he didn't heal), so he was behind the dragon's tail doing a tiny bit of damage with each swing. The Monk's Hundred Fists had exhausted itself, and he continued to chip away at it at a normal pace. The Warrior, however, was dealing massive amounts of damage. Soon after the Monk got drawn in like I had, one critical hit from the tank's Great Sword, and the Dark Dragon was killed. My PS2 controller was rumbling like mad.<br><br>And, in what I consider to be a cute move on Square-Enix's part, my character stood right up and looked around. Another cutscene. The Seeker flew around and basically did his &quot;evil boss monster&quot; thing, revealing another MAJOR chunk of the story, and the four of us spawned back at the Burning Circle. And my character passed out again onto the ground.<br><br>Our White Mage, which could do nothing but watch our failing health bars during the fight, had a Raise spell, but he couldn't get inside the battlefield. So I spawned back at my home point, and ran to the consul to tell them what happened.<br><br>And with that, I bought some Onion equipment from the Auction House, rented a chocobo, and said goodbye to Bastok.<br><br>In Selbina, I gave my five Onion Swords to a guy named Romeo, and he rewarded me with a Wastebasket for my Mog House (which increases storage... a good thing, considering how packed my safe and inventory had become). I took the boat back to Mhaura (did some fishing along the way), ran to the Mea crag, rented a chocobo, and returned to the Heaven's Tower in Windurst where I was promoted to Rank 3.<br><br>I checked my garden (harvested some garlic... STILL no sobbing fungus), switched to my Black Mage, and head to the fishing guild to relax a bit. I bought a Sabiki Rig (a lure, which you don't lose unless your rod/line breaks), and ended up catching about 20 fish in a half hour. Very productive.<br><br>So I'm back home. My auctioned items are finally beginning to sell, and my cash flow is coming back. I'm on my way to the Tahrongi Canyon, hopefully to do some soloing before heading to the Maze to kill some high-EXP worms. Once I get my Black Mage to Level 16 (at least), it'll be time to break out the Red Mage again, and make a trip back to Jeuno.</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

Nothing fancy.<br><br>So like I said last time, I need to attempt Mission 6 (hereafter referred to as Mission 2-3). I get a letter from the secretary inside the Heaven's Tower in Windurst saying I need to travel to the consuls in both San d'Oria and Bastok. They both have a task that will render me an international adventurer if I'm able to complete them.<br><br>Getting my Black Mage to Level 10 (the goal I set for myself before I could leave) meant heading up to the Tahrongi Canyons on my own instead of sticking around in Sarutabaruta, where everything was too easy. Without the melee punch that a Red Mage packs, I had to rely on spells. However, those last few EXP points came rather rapidly, and I hit Level 10, which brought with it a boost to Magic Attack Power as a passive trait.<br><br>Back to Windurst, changed back into Red Mage form, rode a chocobo to Mhaura, and took a boat to Selbina. I caught about five fish on the way there (and hooked a few monsters as well), but soon discovered that I was lacking in storage space for my items. I had decided it would be wise to bring along my two next spells - Regen and Gravity - so that if I do advance a level on this journey, I'll be prepared with some new firepower.<br><br>So, through Valkurm, rent a chocobo, ride to San d'Oria, and rent a Mog House, where I unfortunately learn that the sobbing fungus I was growing turned into 30 water crystals instead. The crystals sold for 3000 gil, but still... Back for another go.<br><br>People have complained about an overcrowding problem in San d'Oria. <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/082.jpg target=akztarg>Don't you agree?</a><br><br>I head to the consul, who referred me to the San d'Orian castle. The NPC at the castle rants on and on for five minutes about how foreigners suck, and how the Elvaan are the greatest race, and how all Tarutarus should be fed to the animals and whatnot. Then he kindly asks me to go kill the Warchief Vakgut in the Ghelsba Outpost (where Lorlithor got pwned doing his mission with me earlier on).<br><br>The Warchief was the first notorious monster I had ever fought, and it took me forever to get the poor bastard to spawn. You come to this massive open area filled with <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/083.jpg target=akztarg>Asian-looking huts</a> and then kill all the other Orcs in the area to get the dude to spawn. He was no problem whatsoever, and I reported back to San d'Oria with my results. Off to Bastok.<br><br>I rode a chocobo back to Selbina, and got caught up in two quests while I was there. The first had me hunting Hares in hopes that they would drop a cabbage or two that this guy could feed to his prize sheep. Not very glamorous, but it increases local fame. The second has the mayor asking you to make clay imprints of ancient stone monuments littered all around Vana'diel. Very time consuming, but the payoff is nice, and it gives me an excuse to kill some cool monsters along the way. And again, good fame. High fame = better quests.<br><br>My time spent in Valkurm was very profitable. I didn't get enough cabbage for a full stack, but I got tons of EXP. If anything was a &quot;decent challenge&quot; or &quot;even match&quot;, I'd enfeeble it within an inch of its life (Bind, Slow, Silence, Paralyze, Poison, Dia) and nuke it to death with enhanced melee attacks (Blaze Spikes, Enaero) and elementals (Fire, Aero). Most monsters, once I had a rhythm going, wouldn't even take off half my life before I killed them for 100 EXP.<br><br>I also felt particularly proud when I - in a fit of revenge - killed off a <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/084.jpg target=akztarg>Ghoul</a> by myself. Amazingly, I was also able to take on a &quot;tough&quot; monster myself, using a similar strategy, wiping it out for a very nice 140 EXP.<br><br>I tried to party with another group just for kicks, but it was so unprofitable, I gave my 15-minute warning about 10 minutes after joining. These guys didn't have a White Mage, which made me healer, and even though I followed healing protocol to a 'T', these guys could not hang onto the hate. I was getting hit multiple times per battle, interrupting my casts, and leaving the tanks in the red on a few occasions.<br><br>It was an extremely poorly equipped group. We were filled with tanks and damage dealers, but in that group, I was the only one with a long range weapon (my Federation Bow) and I had the highest defense (97, about 20 points higher than the 2nd highest). I should have been PULLING, not HEALING. Maybe both.<br><br>But the second I got killed when these idiots stopped doing their job, I disbanded.<br><br>I got to Level 21, and it was a great moment. I set up new macros, and unintentionally got a chance to try out the new magic when I set out for Bastok.<br><br>A Goblin Mugger - rated &quot;tough&quot; - spawned right next to me as I went to leave. Now, every Final Fantasy fan knows what Regen does, but Gravity has a very different meaning. Gravity spells in the past games would wipe out a percentage of your HP (similar to Static Field in Diablo II), but in this game, it decreases enemy evasion and movement speed.<br><br>So you can imagine what I did. I casted Gravity, ran like Hell, and in no time, the Goblin was out of sight, and I was free to zone.<br><br>I run to the nearest crag and grab a chocobo, and then head to the outlying lands of Bastok: <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/085.jpg target=akztarg>North Gustaberg</a>. Lemme just stop and tell you about this place, though.<br><br>I'd never been to Bastok before. I've never even seen a screenshot. And that goes for Gustaberg, as well. I'd been to San d'Oria before, and obviously, Windurst. Jeuno, I visited for the first time to do the chocobo quest, but I was too petrified on the way there to really enjoy the approach.<br><br>Gustaberg is really something else. You first enter, and you feel like you're in a barren wasteland. On your left, there's nothing but a giant dead tree leaning on a cliff. But then the place opens up. There's a BEAUTIFUL waterfall in the distance. There's grass, and wildlife - sparse, but very much alive. And here I was galloping around on my chocobo enjoying the scenery like never before.<br><br>And the music... The background music reminds me of &quot;Schala's Theme&quot; from Chrono Trigger. It's absolutely beautiful. I couldn't believe how I felt on my way to Bastok. It was one of those &quot;moments&quot; that make Final Fantasy XI seem like a real world.<br><br>Five minutes from the entrance, I abandoned my chocobo at the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/086.jpg target=akztarg>gates of Bastok</a>. Mines of Moria, anybody?<br><br>I couldn't believe my eyes...<br><br>The heart and soul of every Final Fantasy game is centered in Bastok. The proud, melodic main theme... the NPC's... <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/087.jpg target=akztarg>the building design</a>... it's all so familiar. Bastok is the natural home to Galkas (the big blue hairy fighters) and Humes (humans). It's a city based around mining and industry, though it's much smaller than Jeuno, Windurst, or San d'Oria. It has the lowest population, as well, making for a <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/088.jpg target=akztarg>very quiet, very pleasant place to live</a>.<br><br>If I ever make a second character (who will most likely be melee-based), he's going to live here.<br><br>But I had business to attend to. I checked out the Auction House, <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/089.jpg target=akztarg>rented a Mog House</a> (which had a very industrialized look to it...), and went searching for the consul, which was actually located inside the Metalworks, strangely.<br><br>The consul told me, once again, to talk to the local officials, who further referred me to this mean Galka in the cafeteria. He spoke of a cave filled with Quadav (Bastok equivalent of Yagudo or Orc, remember) that was experiencing a similar uprising to that which was happening in San d'Oria. He also mentioned that there was a magic circle at the end of those mines. Anyone that steps through that circle never comes back. And guess who they want to investigate it....<br><br>Sounds peachy.<br><br>Before I left, I took one last look at the map, and I spotted something of interest on it. Quickly, I ran down the hall, threw open the iron door, ran up some steps, and found yet another unforgetable Final Fantasy tradition hard at work....<br><br>Of course, he didn't bother with me because I didn't have any fame yet, but <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/090.jpg target=akztarg>IT'S CID!</a> CID! AWESOME!<br><br>I pretty much called it a night at that point. There's an eight-hour server outage today while they install this MASSIVE patch that fixes a lot of issues and adds a buttload of new weapons, items, furniture, skills, and quests. So I won't be able to enter the Final Fantasy XI portion of PlayOnline until 9:00 tonight EST, and even then, I still have to download the update.<br><br>I did, however, do some research on this &quot;magic circle&quot; that I need to &quot;investigate&quot;.<br><br>You want to know why nobody comes back when they enter that magic circle?<br><br>There's a huge dragon at the other side, and I need to round up a party and kill it.<br><br>Bring it on... *fists flare up with elemental magic*</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

I wish you could just send pearls to each other's delivery boxes, but then, we'd be spammed by them constantly.<br><br>Mostly because I had massive amounts of cash at my disposal, a fungus growing in my Mog House, and a number of auctions in progress, I knew I wanted to stay close to home, but I was having trouble figuring out what to do. I did have to level my subjob, but I wasn't quite ready for that yet.<br><br>I was browsing the forums at <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com target=akztarg>Allakhazam</a> and checking out yet another thread talking about people who didn't know what they were doing. In defense of the noobs, one person said how they can tolerate a subjob that's a few levels below the cap, equipment that isn't quite as nice as it could be, or a person that doesn't use food. &quot;But an experienced character that's still Rank 2? That's just laziness.&quot;<br><br>Oops.<br><br>The reason I was stuck at Rank 2 was because of the infamous Mission 2-1, which requires me to retrieve something from the depths of the Shakhrami Maze. Even though you get the mission at a relatively low level, there's no chance you can complete it then; the ends of the Maze are populated with Ghouls, Goblin Butchers, and - at the top of the heap - Scorpions. We almost tangoed with a Scorpion at the end of the Eco-Warrior fiasco, and despite advancing 10 levels since when I first saw one, they're still classified as &quot;incredibly tough.&quot;<br><br>I had two spells that would turn the tides in my favor. Sneak eliminates all noise that you make as you walk so that enemies that detect by sound can't aggro you. Deodorize eliminates your any smell that you may be radiating so that enemies that detect by scent can't aggro you. Scorps detect using sound, and track using scent. So by casting those two spells I should be safe.<br><br>As I recently discovered, Goblin Ambushers, Tinkerers, and Butchers are no longer a problem, as long as I only fight one at a time. Ghouls, however, still give me the rundown. Most of the journey was me trying desperately to stay away from the bone huts where the Ghouls lived. If one aggroed me, I'd have to run back to the entrance and zone before it killed me.<br><br>The worst moment came when I entered this massive room filled with Goblins and Ghouls. I hugged the left wall, looking for the exit, and I come to an incline. I get to the top of the incline and nearly jump out my Taru boots when I saw an angry red Maze Scorpion looking at me. I ran back down and went around this hump, only to realize that I couldn't get to the door without going through the Scorpion.<br><br>I cast Sneak and Deodorize, but all that did was piss off some Gobs that were nearby. It was for the best, though. Someone actually took on the Scorpion as I was fighting the Gobs, and I was able to proceed.<br><br>The final room was filled with tons of fossils and even more Scorpions. I cast Sneak and Deodorize and proceeded to check every fossil I came to for the stone I needed. The one I was looking for was in the back, between two pits, with a Scorpion standing right on top of it. I managed to walk up, grab the stone, and get a decent distance away before the two spells wore off. (They don't last very long, unfortunately.)<br><br>I run for the door, only to hear an ominous &quot;click-click-click&quot; from behind me. I didn't bother to check. A Scorp had aggroed, and I had to run.<br><br>I have this problem when I play FFXI. I can't go ten seconds without checking the map and making sure I'm heading in the right direction, but you don't have that luxury when you're being chased. I just trusted my gut and ran like Hell. Of course, trusting my gut took me past a number of other aggressive monsters. Every five seconds, I heard the growl of a Goblin or the echo of a Ghoul's howl. I couldn't look back, but I was certain there was a train of about seven aggressive monsters behind me.<br><br>I reached the entrance room, which was surprisingly empty except for one tiny party healing near the exit. I didn't have a shout macro, so I couldn't warn them. I just had to blow past them, leaving them sitting amongst an aggro orgy as I safely zoned. Amazingly, I only got hit twice during the whole ordeal, but I probably killed that poor Level 12 Taru who was innocently healing. He took one look at my Scorp, and said, &quot;oh s***..&quot;<br><br>I hate the Tahrongi Canyons, but I was happy to see it again. I ran to the Crag, rented a chocobo, visited the Cat Burglar in Windurst, and head to the last leg of the mission in the Horutoto Ruins. This part was easy. No aggro monsters at all. Just had to find the magnificent <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/077.jpg target=akztarg>Mahogany Door</a> and go inside.<br><br>This is where things got interesting.... Locke swears Final Fantasy XI doesn't have a story, but the cutscene that ensued inside the Cat Burglar's lair was intense on a number of different levels. There is a definitely a villian to deal with - or rather, a lot of villians - that poses a greater threat to Windurst than even the Beastmen, and if my guess is correct, the focus of the missions from this point forward will be the advancement of that storyline.<br><br>To close off the quest requires me to visit a previously-locked house in Windurst, but I got curious.... I checked the map (like I usually do) and I noticed that there was a square room in the southwest corner of the ruins. Since the pathways inside the ruins are carved out and irregular, this intrigued me. So I put on my fake moustache and went in to investigate.<br><br>Lots of bad memories came back. I tried to go down this hallway a few times during the Beta, and I was always killed in the process. The enemies to fear then were the Beady Beetles, which attack very quickly and make it difficult to cast spells. They were useless now. The first few didn't even bother to aggro because they knew I'd kick their ass.<br><br>Arguably the coolest monster I've seen so far lives in the depths of Horutoto as well: Blobs. A <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/078.jpg target=akztarg>Blob</a> looks like a slime from other Final Fantasy games at first, but then you start fighting it, and it starts morphing into other shapes. When it attacks you, it takes on a human-looking shape, and starts beating you. I thought that was awesome. It's not awesome, though, that they're very resistant to physical attacks, which meant it was me, my Fire spell, and a lot of MP to beat the thing.<br><br>I continued deeper. The next hallway was filled with more Beetles, which I took out easily, but then things turned rough. Right in front of me were a Goblin Butcher (which is a strong melee attacker) and a Goblin Ambusher (which is a strong ranged attacker), and the second that Butcher started running towards me, I knew I was in for a rough fight...<br><br>Thankfully I was fully healed, because the Butcher got the attention of his buddy to help out in the fight. The two of them took me on at once. The hard part about being a Red Mage is decided when to use your MP on attack spells and when to use it to heal.<br><br>First thing's first: Slow, Bio, Blind, Dia on the Butcher. This made him much easier to deal with. If enough damage accumulated, I'd use Cure II and make up for it. When he went down, his friend was next, and he got the same treatment.<br><br>But he dropped a nice little trinket after the battle... a Horutoto Ruins Key. And I knew immediately what it was for. There was a treasure chest in our midsts....<br><br>I healed up as quickly as I could and realized I had two options. On my left was a large, lit stairway that headed towards the big square room on the map. In front of my was a narrow hallway that ended in a small circular room.<br><br>The Gobs made that decision for me. One of them aggroed, and he took TWO his buddies this time. <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/yikes.gif> I bolted like s*** on grease to the stairwell. The Gobs attacked me the whole time. At the top of the steps was a magic gate, which I opened, and saw the insides of the Horutoto Ruins towers around me. Great! Easy monsters and lots of exits! I know this place.<br><br>But oh no...<br><br>Where the simple Level 5 monsters once were stood Goblin Muggers and Goblin Leechers, both around Level 25-30. I was doomed. I ran around looking for an exit, gate, zone, chest, anything. But I was killed and spawned back at Buburimu.<br><br>I wasn't going to let that stop me. I ran back to the ruins and travelled the same path, got to the same intersection, and took the second route. More Goblins chased me down, but I didn't stop. I kept running and got to the circular room where between two Blobs sat - lo and behold - a treasure chest. I ran to the chest, unlocked it, grabbed the contents, and watched as seven Goblins, two Beetles, and two Blobs beat me down.<br><br>The chest contained a Moth Axe, which I later sold at auction for 4000 gil.<br><br>I polished off the mission at the House of the Hero, learned yet another amazing plot development, and ran to the gate guards to get another. Since I'd donated so many crystals, I could skip the next mission and go straight to the third, which rewards you with a nasty chunk of gil and Rank 3. The Mission requires you to deliver a letter to the Windurstian consul in San d'Oria and Bastok, which should be cool since I've never been to Bastok before.<br><br>Postponing my travel plans for the sake of my sobbing fungus, I switched to my Black Mage job, bought a new fishing rod, and commenced leveling. One Warrior named <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/079.jpg target=akztarg>Morion</a> wanted to party for a bit, so we head back to the Horutoto Ruins (the EASY ones) to kill some Gobs. Of course, we never made it there because this kid decided to attack a &quot;tough&quot; Crawler with half HP while I was healing. He started to pout, and then logged off.<br><br>I find it funny that if you remove the &quot;I&quot; in his name, you get &quot;Moron.&quot;<br><br>I continued to fight at the north end of Sarutabaruta. Experience was pretty paltry, and enemies were far from plentiful. I did, however, spot another summoned monster that I'd never seen before:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/080.jpg target=akztarg>Shiva</a>.<br><br>She's hot.<br><br>Things picked up when I went to the Tahrongi Canyons. Every enemy there was awarding me with 72-100 EXP a fight, and I ended up advancing two levels by the end of the day.<br><br>Once I reach Level 10, and once I grow that damn fungus, I'm off to San d'Oria.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Fri Jul 23 16:12:36 2004 by ArTwoKay</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

Being a BLM/RDM at this point is awesome. It's like being a really diesel Black Mage (more HP, more MP, better melee) that can cast Cure on himself as well. It's not as easy to go for long stretches at at time without healing because he consumes much more MP than the melee-intensive Red Mage, but it's nice to be self-sufficient. The best part is the cost. Since I already picked up a bunch of Black Magic spells for my Red Mage, I don't have to repurchase them, so the only cash I need to spend is on armor, which isn't that expensive and is also rather easy to make. I made my own Cape, for example, out of that grass cloth and thread that I've been making from Yagudo necklaces.<br><br>I've also decided to attempt gardening. One dusty old quest requires that you obtain a sobbing fungus for a cranky student - ideally by growing one in your Mog House. Since I'm going to be sticking to the Windurstian borders, it will be rather easy to check it once every Earth day to feed it and make sure it doesn't wilt. Of course, I have been checking it compulsively every hour or so... <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/rolleyes.gif><br><br>With little money to spend and lots of farming opportunities, you'd think life as a low-level mage would be sweet. If anything ruins it for me, though, it's the new players. I like being the experienced one. I like running around and casting Cure and Protect on people that need it. I like answering questions when people ask. But I do not like people that steal my kills, annoy me, or pretend they know more than I do.<br><br><u>Example 1:</u> A Level 4 Warrior approaches me, now a Level 7 Black Mage, and asks if I want to party. I ask him if he is new, and he says yes. So, I tell him that people in general don't start partying until about Level 10, especially not with someone who is three or more levels higher than they are. He accepts that, and I tell him to /tell me if he has any more questions, or if he wants to party once he gains a few more levels.<br><br>That guy is a newbie, but he's not a noob. He's a good guy.<br><br><u>Example 2:</u> A Level 4 Monk approaches me and asks if I want to party. I ask him if he is new, and he says... no. I ask him why he'd want to party with me when I'm three levels above him, and he contests it, saying &quot;Yes, I will get EXP.&quot; It takes him about five minutes between lines to type. So I party with him. He must be getting 2 EXP per fight. He refuses to take the front lines with me. He uses his special once-every-two-hours ability for no reason (though it did look cool...). He doesn't use the /party talk mode. He insists on using /tell, even though it takes so much longer to type than just /p. I was glad when he had to leave.<br><br>That guy is a noob, through and through.<br><br>Noob-less, I move up near the Sarutabaruta outpost and take out whatever Yagudos and Crawlers I see, until some high-level character comes in and tells all the low-level characters to clear out because Garrison is starting. He goes on to explain that Garrison is when a bunch of really powerful Yagudo come and attack the outpost, essentially. Reason enough by me, so I head back to Windurst to check my fungus.<br><br>As soon as I step through the gate, somebody shouts out that they're looking for party members for the Eco-Warrior quest. Ecstatic, I /tell him that I'm a Level 20/7 RDM/BLM, and he accepts me without prejudice.<br><br>Each of the three cities has an Eco-Warrior quest that is notorious for being challenging and frustrating. You receive the Windurst quest from a tree-hugger sitting in a tavern complaining about how the environment has gone to sh*t with the arrival of new monsters. He wants you to go to the lair - which happens to be in the Shakhrami Maze - and eliminate the threat, bringing him back something to prove you've done the deed. Well, you get to the Maze, and there's a dude at the front that sprays you with a monster attractant that will make the target monsters - three Wyrmflies - appear when you reach their lair. One huge problem: the spray caps your level at 20. So, you could be a Level 75 character with nasty gear and all your spells, and you'll be back down to Level 20 (and completely naked, too, because your cap won't allow all that high-level gear) for the next Earth hour. And you have to reach and fight the Wyrmflies in that amount of time with that handicap.<br><br>Nearly every online recommendation says that nobody should even attempt the Eco Warrior quest without a full alliance of well-equipped characters; in other words, <b>three parties of six people wearing Level 20 gear.</b> Very few people can get this sort of a group together, and even fewer can succeed without watching the three-party alliance dissolve into mediocrity. The reward is a scroll that will give you anywhere from 500 to 1000 EXP, and 5000 gil.<br><br>I jumped at the opportunity to participate because lord knows when the next maniac will come along who decides to attempt the quest. I did my sales, checked my fungus, and proceeded to help him advertise in Windurst Waters (using a rather cheesy /shout macro, I might add). During this period, we had anywhere from four to eight party members, but disconnects and boredom caused that number to waver by quite a lot. Opticon, one of the Ghoul hunters I partied with a few days ago, even joined at one point.<br><br>The alliance leader's name was Yawgmoth. He seemed like a nice enough guy. He kept things in order, had some good strategies for party forming, and had his heart set on completing the quest. His passion was contageous. I offered to walk from Windurst to the Shakhrami Maze and recruit people as I went. The poor guy was thrilled to hear somebody so into it. And so, I went to the general store, bought some arrows, and headed for the gates.<br><br>Before I left, however, I made a purchase from the gate guard. Every character has an account of Conquest Points that you earn for defeating monsters with Signet cast on you, completing missions, delivering supplies, and other stuff. At this point, I had about 6500 Conquest Points, and decided to blow some on two items that I figured would increase my chances of survival: a Scroll of Instant Reraise (casts Raise on you as soon as you die) and a Scroll of Instant Warp (returns you to your home point). It cost 1250 points altogether, and I didn't advertise it for the sake of our morale.<br><br>As I walked, I hunted Mandragoras, Crawlers, and Yagudos for Saruta cotton (which I needed for a quest), silk thread (arguably, the most valuable non-rare drop in the Windurst region), and Yagudo Necklaces (which I turn into grass cloth using my weaving skill). I used my bow and arrow, which I'd neglected since Level 2, just to spice things up a bit. And every five minutes, I'd hit the advertising macro.<br><br>By the time I got to Shakhrami, we had about ten people in our party and things began to show their true colors. There were a number of people that couldn't participate in the quest because they had already taken it up in another city. Lots of people almost left Windurst without picking it up in the first place. And there were the requisite number of people with crappy spells, crappy skills, and crappy equipment. Yawgmoth asked at one point, &quot;Now, I'm assuming everyone is familiar with their job roles, correct?&quot; Um, excuse me?<br><br>And even so, working with an alliance is an entirely different animal than working with a regular party. To form an alliance, you need to form three parties, and then the three parties ally together. You can cast spells on anyone in those three parties, and the three parties can fight the same monster at once. However, group spells - like Protectra and Curaga, which enhance/cure everyone in your party - don't have any effect on the two other parties with which you are allied. It's this alliance structure that explains why so many people recommend a full alliance for this quest. Each party has its own Wyrmfly to fight when the time comes.<br><br>The advertisement I sent out in Shakhrami had great results, and the rest of the crew head up from Windurst on foot, by chocobo, or via Teleport spell. It took quite a while for us to assemble, but it was quite a sight once we first did. I tried to take a screenshot of the whole crew, but it resulted in several failed attempts.<br><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/068.jpg target=akztarg>Attempt #1</a><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/069.jpg target=akztarg>Attempt #2</a><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/071.jpg target=akztarg>Attempt #3</a><br><br>At the last minute, two high-level characters joined our cause. Rambus was a ridiculously powerful Black/White Mage that could Raise and cast extremely powerful elemental spells. A lethal combination, certainly, but could he fight with the level cap? Regardless, his skills came in very handy later on that night.<br><br>With a full alliance, high spirits, and the spray applied, the group <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/070.jpg target=akztarg>marched through the Shakhrami Maze</a> at approximately 12:30 A.M. EST.<br><br>We hadn't gone far, however, when one member of our group told us that he couldn't find the spray NPC. When Yawgmoth asked him if he had received the quest in Windurst, he said no. (He had been recruited inside the Maze itself.) In a fit of frustration, Yawgmoth booted him and told him to come back with the quest. If the alliance had not completed it by then, they would let him join in.<br><br>The alliance was the epitome of chaos after that point. Nobody would listen to Yawgmoth's instructions. He told us to stick together, and people formed a mile-long chain. He told us to stop, and people took ten steps further. He told us to avoid the aggro monsters, and sure enough... the aggro monsters attacked us.<br><br>One unfortunate character happened to catch the attention of two monsters - one Ghoul and one Goblin Leecher. For some unbelievably retarded reason, nobody bothered to cure Yawgmoth after he stepped in to break things up. As a result, he - and my party leader, Tatoto - were killed.<br><br>I'd just like to say that the Ghoul that killed Tatoto was the only Ghoul we fought all night, and it dropped a Magicked Skull. <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/mad.gif><br><br>The rest of the crew came in, cleaned up the mess, and surveyed the damage. We had lost two party leaders, which meant they could not be booted and we had to raise them. Rambus volunteered to run back to the entrance, get his spray removed, and come back fully-powered with a Raise spell for the both of them. Nobody argued, but Yawgmoth laid there on the floor screaming about how we had nine Cure spells in the alliance, and nobody bothered to use one.<br><br>Hey, I was at the back of the line at that point. I couldn't reach him.<br><br>Feeling that things were getting tense, I decided to use the Reraise scroll.<br><br>One of the lighter moments of the evening came after the two fights when everyone had to cure. For three minutes straight, the screen was filled with blue/white sparklies, and the Cure noise sounded in a loop. It was insane.<br><br>With Yawgmoth and Tatoto risen, we all decided to head back to the entrance, remove the spray, and regroup. While nobody wanted to actually do this, it was the only real option. We couldn't risk losing the spray midway through the final fight. And once we reached the entrance, things got rough again.<br><br>One person in particular, Deadwood, made a habit of reminding people how long this quest was taking. I wanted to bite his kneecaps off. I was so listless, I gave my bow and arrows to a party member named Ryld so he could level his bow skill a bit.<br><br>Somewhere in this huge waiting period, we received a call from the guy who walked back to Windurst. He had received the quest, and was ready to come back. Yawgmoth told him to find Opticon and have him teleport to the Crag of Holla, which is visible from the Maze entrance. When Opticon's spell wouldn't work, it was because the guy had never received the teleport crystal from Holla.<br><br>This is why you ALWAYS make the side trip to a Crag whenever you spot one. You never know when you might meet up with someone who could instantly bring you back there.<br><br>At about 1:30 A.M., we sprayed ourselves and set out a second time. This time, we were much more organized, and you could hear people watching, saying, &quot;Oooooh... Eco quest...&quot; in amazement. It was a sight to behold.<br><br>What was even more impressive was how organized things were the second time through. If we saw an aggressive monster, we didn't wait for it to attack us; we annihilated in five seconds flat. We killed Goblins, Carnivorous Crawlers, and Wendigos (fearsome undead creatures that are more powerful than Ghouls) before arriving at <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/072.jpg target=akztarg>the nest</a>.<br><br>The sixteen of us (someone else got lost in the fray, apparently) huddled in a tight ball at the entrance to the lair with everyone telling everyone else not to touch the mysterious &quot;???&quot; spot in the center of the room. That spot would bring out the Wyrmflies and, if we weren't ready, our doom. Once we made sure that we had everything in order, Tatoto bravely stepped forward and triggered the fight.<br><br>The Wyrmflies appeared out of nowhere and started to attack. What ensued in the next two minutes was a fireworks display that made my PS2 grind to a virtual halt. Blizzard and Fire spells erupted all over the screen. The Wyrmflies unleased multiple attacks that hit all sixteen members of the alliance AT ONCE. It was pure mayhem. But it was incredible.<br><br>All I did during the fight was cast Slow, Bio, and Fire on our opposing Wyrmfly. The Fire spell was enough to break him off the tank and send him flying towards me for a single attack... that dealt 69 damage.<br><br>Shortly after, one fly fell. And then a second. And finally, ours. The Wyrmflies were defeated. We were victorious.<br><br>During that battle, three people died, one of which was - once again - Yawgmoth. He wasn't complaining about cures this time. He complained about how he worked for five hours assembling the party and how he couldn't even get the meat in the end. Rambus walked back to the entrance to get his levels back, and most of the party stuck around on Yawgmoth's behalf. Tatoto, however, miraculously ended up back in Windurst about three minutes after the last blow fell.<br><br>I asked how he did that, and somebody said he used the Warp spell.<br><br>Well, lah dee frickin' dah. I used my Warp scroll.<br><br>I spawned at the Buburimu home point, walked to the Crag of Holla, rented a chocobo, and began <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/073.jpg target=akztarg>my victorious journey</a> back to Windurst.<br><br>I still can't believe how awesome it is to have a chocobo license.<br><br>I walked into the tavern and presented the hippie with his meat, and he gave me my reward. The scroll ended up giving me 650 EXP and <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/074.jpg target=akztarg>looked</a> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/075.jpg target=akztarg>damn</a> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/076.jpg target=akztarg>pretty</a> doing it...<br><br>At the end of the day, I had 13,000 gil; more than I'd ever had at one time before, including during the Beta. I had all the cotton I needed for my current quest. My fungus had begun to sprout. My Fire Sword sold for 5,500 gil. I had added another level to my weaver's skill. And, so, I decided to head to Port Windurst and splurge on one 8,000-gil item that I've wanted for a very long time....<br><br>Forum Central now has its own linkshell. I will be travelling to Valkurm today to deliver it to Lorlithor and Anik, if they're around.<br><br>However, the remnants of the alliance had hoped to try the quest a third time for the sake of Yawgmoth. That unfortunately never happened. Despite spending five hours of time on organizing this trek, he never reaped the rewards of it. It is true that he had some of the worst gear in the whole group, but I never expected it to affect his performance so much.<br><br>There were rumors, though, that Yawgmoth and company may be heading back to Shakhrami tonight to give it a second go...<br><br>And hey, the quest is repeatable... <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/smile.gif></p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

Fire is now my main attack spell. I cast that at the start of every battle, followed by Slow, and then Blind, Bio, and Dia. If the enemy is an &quot;Even Match&quot; or less, then they're pussycats. The new Level 20 passive ability - Magic Attack Bonus - doesn't hurt either.<br><br>A bunch of new equipment. New boots and new cape (finally), with a number of other items on my shopping list. The plethora of new spells, including Blaze Spikes, which deals out Fire damage for every physical attack done unto you. Combine that with Enthunder, and that's about 10 extra damage you're doing per attack. It adds up.<br><br>But there was a reason for all this splurging. I knew that being Level 20 meant that I would have to leave the safety of the competing kingdoms and move on to Jeuno at the center of the world. If you remember my Beta journal, you remember how I tried - twice - to get to that point, and both times, I was killed in one hit by a patrolling monster outside of the gates. Then, I was Level 15 Black Mage. Now, I'm Level 20 Red/Black Mage with enough HP and MP to survive... maybe... two hits from an aggressive monster.<br><br>I picked up some &quot;quest supplies&quot; (more on that in a second), took a pit stop at Mhaura to complete another quest (a very easy 1500 Gil), and moved to the far end of the Tahrongi Canyons, leading me into the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/060.jpg target=akztarg>Meraphataud Mountains</a>.<br><br>The creep factor for this place is through the roof. For 75% of the walk, you've got rock walls on either side of you. You can't see enemies above you. They could be staring right at you with your little head in the sights of their bow, and there's no way to avoid them. But see... that's the interesting part. Enemies - and players, for that matter - are extremely rare. There's no music playing in the background. And the enemies that do show their faces are about the same difficulty as those you'd find in the Valkurm Dunes. So that's what I was up against... Valkurm again, except ten thousand times more creepy. I was sooooo glad to be out of there.<br><br>That is, of course, until I realized what came next: the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/061.jpg target=akztarg>Sauromugue Champaign</a>. It's the last thing that separates you from Jeuno, and they make it a tough walk. Aside from the extremely high level Goblins that imploy assistant monsters that are &quot;impossible to gauge&quot; when Checked, there are a TON of giant, dinosaur skeleton-type creatures running about. And it's a long walk. When the most you can do defensively is cast Protect and Shell, and hope for the best, it makes your palms sweaty.<br><br>But, as amazing as it seemed to me, I made it to <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/062.jpg target=akztarg>the gates</a>.<br><br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/063.jpg target=akztarg>Jeuno... is... amazing.</a><br><br>I was impressed by the lush scenery of Windurst. The incredible medieval buildings of San d'Oria made the whole game seem larger than life. The quaint villages of Mhaura and Selbina made me feel cozy. But Jeuno makes you feel tiny. And poor. And very inexperienced.<br><br>Case in point: this is one of the first characters I ran into as soon as I entered the gates. This <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/064.jpg target=akztarg>high-level Dragoon</a> is equipped in his relic gear. All you Dragoon fans, commence drooling.<br><br>Jeuno actually imposes a 10% Duty Tax on all people selling items from a personal bazaar. On one hand, that's yet another small touch for which I have to tip my hat to Square. The <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/065.jpg target=akztarg>attention to detail</a> is incredible. What separates Jeuno from the other three nations is that it's totally neutral. You can rent a Mog House there, but you can never live there. You can never fulfill missions for them, or participate in conquests, or go to war with them. They're just there as the pseudo-capital of Vana'diel and the meeting place for numerous seasoned characters and marketers. You take one step inside the walls, and you can smell the experience.<br><br>Jeuno has shops. Jeuno has stables. Jeuno has an (extremely expensive) Auction House. Jeuno has lots of quests, but most of them require going to relatively difficult areas and farming for dropped items. And like I mentioned before, you can &quot;rent&quot; a temporary Mog House. And I say &quot;rent&quot; because it doesn't actually cost anything. You're only sacrificing the ability to add furniture and garden. You can still store items in your Mog Safe, and you can still accept deliveries. Two relatively miniscule handicaps for the sake of <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/066.jpg target=akztarg>an uber-plush living arrangement</a>? I'll take it! My house in Windurst is a hollowed-out tree with a fountain!<br><br>But yes... this quest I speak of... It's the one thing that brings every character to Jeuno once they hit Level 20. It's a gameplay-changing moment that's arguably as significant as enabling your subjob (though, after the endless hunt for the Magicked Skull, I don't think that's 100% true). The quest isn't difficult, but it's very time consuming. It takes an average of six Vana'diel days to complete, and with a relatively low level and no fame, that's a long time to do nothing. (One Vana'diel day is approximately one Earth hour)<br><br>And yes, this quest should be easy, but I hit a huge snag early on.<br><br>The strategy guide at the IGN Final Fantasy Vault suggests that you bring four of a specific item to Jeuno and trade it to an NPC one at a time, every day at approximately the same time until the supply runs out. At first, the NPC may not be willing to take the item, so you have to keep trying. Well, good old IGN happened to report that you needed <b>the wrong item</b>. It was disappointing because while IGN's item cost no more than 60 Gil, the real item costs about 700 Gil when bought from the Auction House. And the Jeuno Auction House? Average price was an even 1000. Or you could hike to the other side of the world and farm for its drop. But after the nightmarish trip from Windurst, there was no way in Hell I was leaving Jeuno until that quest was complete.<br><br>I had about 2500 Gil upon entering Jeuno, which bought me two of the required items; enough to get me started. But I needed to come up with another 2000 very quickly. Thank GOD I started to work my Clothcraft skill because it just so happens those Grass Cloths I was saving up sell for about 600 Gil a pop. Unfortunately, the inflated prices at the Jeuno Auction House also warrant inflated listing fees.... to the tune of 150 Gil per item. Not... good... at all.<br><br>So Rentwokay is parked at this moment next to the NPC of the decade waiting for the clock to strike 17:00 so he can trade the next item. He's already had two failed trading attempts and two successes. Which means there's only two more trades left before he can head home.<br><br>But what on Earth do I do in all this free time? Besides checking my Delivery Box for auction sales...<br><br>The enemies outside Jeuno are horrendous, save for Stalking Saplings which look like little bouncing scallions. The majority of them are &quot;Tough&quot; but there are a handful of &quot;Even Match&quot; enemies that I can take on pretty nicely for 100 EXP a piece. Of course, there's plenty of other aggro enemies around that like to mess up my playtime. And then, there's the few &quot;Tough&quot; enemies that I tried to fight, despite the warnings. I got one down to 15 HP and then was killed. (I got my revenge though... I ran right back out and kicked the sucker's ass for 120 EXP.) The Jugnar Forest is nearby too, which would allow me to work on a few quests while I am here, but it's not an easy walk with Goblins and (!) Sabertooth Tigers running about.<br><br>But that's essentially why I'm posting this update now... to kill some time and numb the pain of waiting. If I get the quest finished before bed, I'll amend this post. If not, there will be some AWESOME pictures waiting for you all tomorrow morning.</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

My boss is out sick (again) today, which means it's more forum-browsing and Net-surfing between screen captures of dragonfly footage.<br><br>No joke.<br><br>Anyway, back to our show...<br><br>As you may have guessed, I was frustrated beyond all belief as a result of this God-forsaken Magicked Skull hunt. Pairing up with more experienced people was fruitless, not to mention a burden on the part of the other person. I had a feeling people were going to grow sick of the idiot Red Mage running around shouting for help every couple of hours.<br><br>From La Theine, I marched back to Valkurm and sent out another /shout for Ghoul hunting, only to be responded with: Go to Gusgen! Fine then. I'll go to the Gusgen Mines. I'd never been there before, which made getting there a chore. I ended up taking one wrong turn into the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/050.jpg target=akztarg>Jugnar Forest</a>, which other than being controlled by Windurst and a required battleground for a quest I was undertaking was nothing all that special. Or attractive, for that matter.<br><br>It turns out that I had to go through Bastok territory to get to Gusgen, which meant trekking through the dangerous terrain of Valkurm, avoiding the 500 Goblins and Bogys that scattered the landscape. It certainly wasn't a waste though. I added a picture of <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/051.jpg target=akztarg>Garuda</a> to my summoned monster mugshot collection.<br><br>The Konschtat Highlands are the Bastok equivalent of the Tahrongi Canyons. Head one way, and you're going to Selbina. Head another, and you're going to San d'Oria. Head yet another way, and you're beginning that long, difficult trek to Jeuno. Whereas Tahrongi is a barren landscape and La Theine is marshy and green, Konschtat is chilly and fruitful, with lots of flowers and trees. There's also plenty of <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/052.jpg target=akztarg>windmills</a> dotting the landscape. And just when you thought things couldn't get any cooler, Bastok has their own unique beastmen to tango with Windurst's Yagudo and San d'Oria's Orc: the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/053.jpg target=akztarg>Quadav</a>, which kicks all other beastmen races in the ass. Giant turtle men with a huge ass sword. NICE.<br><br>It took a bit of hunting, but I found the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/054.jpg target=akztarg>Gusgen Mines</a> shortly after picking up my third teleport crystal from the nearby crag. It's an area not unlike the Shakrhami Maze, in that it's dark and overflowing with undead, which made it a perfect area for Ghoul hunting. I did my routine /shout, but got no response. I searched the area for high-leveled people, but nobody was sharing their level, and even then, half of them were Japanese.<br><br>In what would later become one of the more stupid decisions in my gameplay experience, I marched my Level 18 Tarutaru ass into the mines and decided to SOLO any Ghouls I would find. I figured that my Cure II spell could deal about 70 damage a shot with each cast, so the fact that they were a &quot;Tough&quot; monster wouldn't stop me. Oh, and who cares IF I DIDN'T HAVE A MAP TO THE MINES... It can't be THAT DIFFICULT to get out! Right?<br><br>Long story short: I found a Ghoul and got schooled.<br><br>I respawned back at Selbina and decided it was time for a drastic change in strategy. I took the boat back to Mhaura and tried to fight some more in Shakrami. I found two people willing to help me. The first was <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/055.jpg target=akztarg>Blowcrapup</a>. He knew where to find a bunch of Ghouls at once, but had to leave before we did anything productive. The second was a Japanese Black Mage, who basically told me to sit in one spot while he ran around pulling Ghouls. We fought about twenty. No skull. I gave up and went to bed.<br><br>The next morning, I woke up determined to polish off the subjob quest. I decided that I would solo the Ghouls and stop relying on other people for help. Ghouls are around Level 20, so all I needed to do was make a few changes to my current equipment situation, buy some new spells, and gain two more levels before the damn bastards could be killable. And with that, I marched proudly back to Windurst, slaying Crawlers and Mandragoras along the way.<br><br>As if Silence wasn't cool enough, I bought Slow. I wasn't a high enough level for Fire yet, and Diaga is dangerous in a cramped setting so I passed on those two, but I figured that the Cure spells would do enough damage to get me through, especially after levelling them a bit more. I sold a bunch of stuff and ended up with a hefty hunk of change to buy a new weapon with. My choice? A Fire Sword. And every seasoned Final Fantasy veteran knows that the undead are weak against Fire.<br><br>I also decided to do a tiny bit of crafting. The Yagudo drop a mess of useless items like Yagudo Feathers, which sell for 9 Gil a piece and don't have any good use early on, and Yagudo Necklaces, which can be traded four at a time to the Cat Burglar for 200 Gil. Turns out you can also turn those Yagudo Necklaces into a few Spools of Grass Cloth with the help of a <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/056.jpg target=akztarg>Wind Crystal</a>. And from that thread, you can make Grass Cloth. And you sell that cloth for much more than what you'd get for selling those annoying necklaces.<br><br>With all that finished, I started to walk back to Mhaura.<br><br>As I walked across the Buburimu Peninsula, I kept my &quot;Seek Party&quot; flag up and got snagged by a very organized group that decided to hang around outside the gate to Mhaura and kill Goblins and Bull Dhalmels. I must say... These guys were efficient. In a few hours of fighting, we only had to stop and rest twice. The individual battles didn't bring in loads of EXP, but there was <i>practically no downtime</i>. And, even more convenient, my healing skill shot through the roof.<br><br>But about that Fire Sword... It was still the cheapest Level 18 option I had at buying time, but I did feel a little ripped. The &quot;fire damage&quot; that the description proclaims only shows its face about 5% of the time. And even then, it only does slightly more damage than my Enthunder spell. So while the overall damage was much more than my old and busted Bee Spatha, I wasn't getting the hot-ass weapon I expected.<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>That party somersaulted me to Level 19, at which point I took the boat to Valkurm and found another party to fight with. They actually wanted me to attack, which made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I set up a bunch of spell macros that yell out quotes from Final Fantasy Tactics whenever I cast an elemental or enfeebling spell. I got to Level 20 in under an hour.<br><br>That party eventually disbanded, which left one last place to go: Gusgen.<br><br>I got to the mines, and there was a siren going off. I thought to myself that things were not off to a good start. I got to the main area (still didn't have a map... that would require a trip to Bastok) and was aggroed by a Skeleton Warrior. I could have taken him, but he summoned two of his friends, and after admitting defeat and wishing I had went ahead and purchased Diaga, I ran like a baby to the entrance to heal.<br><br>When I walked back in, the three Skeletons had formed a line at the end of the hallway, facing in the other direction. One of them was slightly closer than the others, so I attacked him. One down. I waited for the furthest one to start walking and took out the other. Two down. Finally, I charged the third one and took him down.<br><br>With the main area cleared and the Ghoul hunt about to begin, I sent out one last shout for help, and when I got no response, I started to walk. That's when a lone Tarutaru came up to me and asked me if I needed help with Ghouls. What a relief.<br><br>He was helping out a second person, who didn't natively speak English. That other person was kind enough to offer me the first skull that the dude found. How very nice. Of course, after our savior fought dozens of Ghouls, there was nothing to be found except a couple of useless bone chips. The foreign guy apologized non-stop for making him go through all this time wasting for the sake of two noobs who can't find a decent party.<br><br>I was about to give up for the night. I was exhausted, I had work the next day, and I was pretty disappointed about my progress. Again. So I went to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and when I came back, those fateful words flashed on the screen...<br><br><span style='color: Yellow;'>You found <span style='color: Green;'>a magicked skull</span style='color: Green;'> on the Ghoul.</span style='color: Yellow;'><br><br>I was ecstatic! But being the Boy Scout I am, I asked the other party member if he was sure he didn't want the first one.<br><br>Right as I asked, a second one dropped.<br><br>Days of hunting without a single drop. And then two drop within twenty seconds of each other. Altara works in mysterious ways...<br><br>I said goodbye to Gusgen. I walked cheerfully through the highlands. I entered Valkurm only to spot - out of nowhere - another character from <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg>Forum Central</a>, waiting by the border to the zone. Say hello to <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/057.jpg target=akztarg>Anik</a>, everyone.<br><br>And with that, I found the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/058.jpg target=akztarg>elder NPC</a> at the end of the Selbina docks, and traded him a damselfly worm, a magicked skull, and a crab apron to finally obtain the subjob flag.<br><br>Needless to say, I took the boat to Mhaura, marched back to Windurst, did some shopping, and set my subjob. I am now a <b><i>Level 20 Red Mage / Level 6 Black Mage</i></b>.<br><br>Before I begin to level my subjob full-time, however, there is one more quest I think I should do now that I am Level 20. It's going to require me to get to Jeuno, but it may be the last long journey I ever take on foot...</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

As a result, the monsters get pissed off and start attacking them, which defeats the purpose of the tanks. Even more frustrating, after they blow all that MP, they have to sit and regenerate it all, which leads to more downtime, which leads to angry party members.<br><br>So after all this Taru-bashing, I stepped in and voiced my case. Everyone who plays the game knows that the parties in the Valkurm Dunes have sucked lately. Lots of noobs, lots of people hunting for subjobs, and very few gamers who have any idea of what's going on. Square-Enix made this a very party oriented game, which means - duh - that we have to all get along if we want to progress. So if some crappy Taru blows all his MP every round, why not tell him to slow it down a bit? He probably doesn't know otherwise.<br><br>That was my situation. The problem with fighting high level monsters is that they have a chance of resisting your spells that significantly increases as the level difference increases. So my nasty-ass Aero spell that normally does 35 damage will crap out and only do 6. I don't know what's worse: having someone tell you that you're not pulling your weight, or having someone call you a noob because you wasted all your MP trying to deal a decent amount of damage. Final Fantasy XI uses a hate system. The amount of hate a monster have towards party members determines who they attack. Certain actions add more hate than others. Healing, in general, adds more hate than attacking, for example, which is why White Mages have to calm down when things get heated. The mothers of all hate-dealing abilities is Provoke and Benediction. Provoke's sole purpose is to get the monster to start attacking you, and it's the most used ability for tanks. Benediction is the White Mage's special &quot;use once every two hours&quot; ability that deals a massive amount of healing, at the cost of making that same White Mage the target of all monsters within a certain radius (unless you've got really, really good tanks).<br><br>Somebody told me that my answer was a cop-out response. He said that if I've been playing the game long enough, I should know all that stuff. And that's a bullsh*t statement because 9 out of every 10 people hit up the Internet for recipes, quest solutions, maps, strategies, and whatever else you could possibly want. I would have never understood the hate system if I didn't read about it on GameFAQs, partially because someone told me during the Beta that those bats in the Shakrhami Maze were attacking me just because I was a magic user and I had less HP than everyone else.<br><br>That, I know now, is bullsh*t. The bat was attacking me because I was nuking the crap out of him with Fire, blowing all my MP, and making my hate level shoot through the roof.<br><br>[/rant]<br><br>I can't really tell what everyone's answer to my reply was because I can't access the forums from my home computers. I've been reading them at work. So I'm curious to find out to what extent I was flamed afterwards.<br><br>I just clocked in at 100 hours of gameplay. I'll post the latest chronicles of Rentwokay when I get done with work.

I reached Level 18, and the subjob quest is officially underway. The only item left that I have to find is the &quot;magicked skull&quot;, which is dropped by ghouls, which only appear between the hours of 10:00 P.M. and 4:00 A.M. Yes, it's frustrating as hell.<br><br>After a bit of reluctance, I decided to head back to Windurst, cash in some items, and pick up the crab apron that I left in my Mog Safe like an idiot.<br><br>I've noticed that the people I see on boats tend to be of a ridiculously high level. <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/045.jpg target=akztarg>Evolution</a> is a Level 72 Black Mage. The level cap is set at 75. Wow.<br><br>Then, there was <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/046.jpg target=akztarg>Voruta</a> standing outside of Mhaura. I didn't notice what level he had reached, but he's dressed in White Mage Relic gear, which makes him look exactly like the traditional White Mages that we've seen in every Final Fantasy up to this point.<br><br>After a few deaths, a number of profitable transactions, and some new armor, I decided to finish off the subjob quest. I had read online that the Shakrami Maze is also home to an abundance of ghouls, so I head back there for the first time in weeks. I shouted out for some help and found <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/047.jpg target=akztarg>Opticon</a>, a Level 38 White Mage with plenty of experience and a whole lot of patience.<br><br>He took me to some <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/048.jpg target=akztarg>deep, dark corners of Shakhrami</a> that I had never seen before. The reason nobody leaves the entrance is because that's where all the Maze Makers hang out (which I can SOLO now for 100 EXP a pop) and it's <i>not</i> where the Maze Scorpions hang out. These big, burly, black beasts are the reason I haven't completed Mission 4 yet and why it'll probably be a long time before I do.<br><br>The deeper you go, the creepier it gets. We couldn't travel down this path because we could see Scorpions over the horizon, and I have a habit of attracting high level monsters. We fought a number of ghouls, but none of them dropped the skull. Disappointing for the two of us.<br><br>When things got tough, he would cast Sneak and <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/049.jpg target=akztarg>Invisible</a> on me, which would make me virtually undetectable.One ghoul happened to kick my ass, kill me, and proceed to bring Opticon to the brink of death with the help of a buddy. Opticon had Raise, which lessened that blow by quite a bit, until he informed me that bats can detect the weakness state in a person that has just been risen.<br><br>Nice.<br><br>He had to leave but was nice enough to warp me back to the La Theine Plateau, five minutes from Valkurm. It wasn't that exciting a day. In fact, it was on the disappointing side. But as soon as I get my subjob, the whole dynamic is going to change.</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

Though the En- spells are later surpassed by the greatness of Convert (switch HP and MP), Refresh (like Regen for MP), and Raise, the En- spells imbue your weapon with an elemental force.<br><br>So, if I'm chipping away at an enemy with my sword, the Enthunder is dealing <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/039.jpg target=akztarg>a bit of lightning damage</a> with each hit. And it looks AWESOME.<br><br>Since I have such a crappy enhancing stat, the hits only do about 4 damage additionally; slightly more if I'm fighting a water-based enemy. But as the spells get more powerful and as my skills increase, that number will go up.<br><br>My Black Mage eventually racked up enough money to purchase the spell, as well as some <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/040.jpg target=akztarg>new lizard armor</a>. That alone was reason enough to dust off my Bee Spatha and get back to Red Maging. (Yes, I just used a job name as a verb.)<br><br>The last time I fought anything in the Tahrongi Canyons was when I was Level 14 or so. I decided to return and see how much stronger I had become. Canyon Crawlers - usually too difficult despite their great drops - fell easily. Yagudo Persecutors? Easy. Yagudo Pipers? Piece of cake. Wild Dhalmels? Little bit tougher than everyone else, but they're still a great kill at about 72 EXP a pop when soloing. Nice drops, too, if you're lucky. But I definitely felt a sense of self-satisfaction since I've been wanting to solo one of them for so long.<br><br>And just when I thought things couldn't get any cooler, I happened to spot these dude's playing. The one in the foreground is Serpopard Ishtar, a notorious monster - about the equivalent of a &quot;unique&quot; dhalmel, if we were playing Diablo 2.<br><br>I had no idea how powerful this dude was, especially considering a band of us tried to kill him during the Beta test and all got schooled. It turns out he's about Level 20, which may have been a little too tough for me. Nevertheless, I sent out a /shout for some assistance, but no one came. So I passed the dude up (which was hard to do, I must say - I still have never killed a notorious monster) and did a lot of excavating with my pickaxe, picking up a few bit items.<br><br>The coolness of the day just about ended there, however. One step onto the Buburimu Peninsula, and my luck ran out. I was aggroed by a Goblin Butcher (another enemy that I can't wait to be able to solo), who chased me all the way to Mhaura, forced me to head in the wrong direction, and ended up teaming up with two of his friends along the way. The Goblin train killed me just out of Mhaura where I was headed.<br><br>I spawned back at the entrance to the peninsula and ended up making it successfully the second time, just seconds away from the departing of the ferry to Selbina. Both my fishing rods had broken within the previous week, and it definitely sucked having to sit inside the boat while everyone was having the fishing trip of their lives. Pirates ended up attacking again, though, so I suppose it was for the best. I tried to level up my enhancement magic in my spare time.<br><br>The Valkurm Dunes were drastically different this time around, though. In my absense, Square-Enix added a number of new monster to the demographic, including Hill Lizards and <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/041.jpg target=akztarg>Bogys</a>. Hill Lizards are easy kills, so I wasn't worried so much about them. Bogys, however, are the reason people do the Selbina subjob quest instead of the Mhaura subjob quest. They are massively powerful. I had no idea how powerful until one of them cast Aeroga on me for 108 damage when I was at only half HP. That's over 100 damage to everyone in the party at once.<br><br>My parties sucked. No one was organized, everyone was an @#%^, and I ended up dying three more times at the hand of some Goblins that spawned right next to me as we were fighting. Whenever a second monster popped up, people would just scream &quot;ZONE! ZONE!&quot; and then <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/043.jpg target=akztarg>stand there like nothing was happening</a>.<br><br>The one party I met that finally had their act together (slightly) ended up running like Hell to the &quot;secret beach&quot; at the northwest corner of Valkurm. If you look on the map of Valkurm, it looks like the area stops, but in fact, there's a cave filled with aggressive bats that like to link, leading to a secluded beach.<br><br>The six of us fought some Beach Pugils, since Snippers and Damselflies were becoming too easy for us. We had to zone at one point, thanks to another randomly appearing Goblin, but it was cool because we zoned to <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/044.jpg target=akztarg>an area that I'd never seen before</a>. It was expansion pack-only, too, which explained why it couldn't be seen on the map.<br><br>The fighting itself, though, was disappointing for me because I need to fight Damselflies for their subjob item, but we eventually headed back to the mainland and disbanded.<br><br>I took <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/042.jpg target=akztarg>this picture</a> because this stone with song runes on it is important for the Bard subjob quest. There are a few &quot;random&quot; items like these around, and it's always interesting when you spot one.<br><br>Anyway, I took a break, and when I came back, I found a party that was willing to help me. We eventually got a worm (HOORAY!), and I stopped playing with about 1000 EXP till Level 18. I also maxed out a few stats (for a Level 17 character, anyway) and learned a new sword skill called Red Lotus Blade that I can't use because it's exclusive to Warriors.<br><br>Of course, that was about the point that I realized I left my crab apron back in my Mog Safe, which means I'll have to hike all the way back there if I ever want to finish the subjob quest. *sigh*<br><br>Oh, and one more thing...<br><br>For those of you out there who want to see the game in action, I suggest you Google for &quot;Final Fantasy XI Benchmark.&quot; It's a utility that tests if your system is powerful enough to handle the game, but it also includes a demonstration mode explaining a bit of the backstory and showing off a few really great effects.

I made it to Level 17, which leaves me one level away from the awesomeness that is Level 18. I unfortunately got to that point with the help of one of the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/032.jpg target=akztarg>most retarded parties</a> that I've ever joined.<br><br>Instead of staying in the mainland where most of the flies and crabs hang out, they went to the coast to take on more crabs and some pugils. Half the members of the group already had their subjobs, but the other half didn't. So when the three non-subjob people asked if we could kill some flies and ghouls to get the remaining items in the quest, they just said, &quot;No, because half of us don't need them.&quot;<br><br>BUT HALF OF US DO, YOU IDIOT!<br><br>So I left as soon as I got to Level 17. If they were a fast party, I wouldn't care. But they were incredibly disorganized. Two people would pull instead of one, which usually resulted in them bringing back more than one monster for the party to take on. The other healer told me to heal the top three group members, and he'd heal the bottom three members. Not only was that nonsense - he was ALWAYS healing my top half the second any group member's HP turned yellow - he'd wait until some idiot tank got to 14 HP, and then cast Cure I. And if I tried to heal them before that time, he'd get pissed off at me.<br><br>Amateurs.<br><br>The second party was very organized, very fast, and agreed to fight flies, but we just weren't bringing in the experience that we'd hoped. I was getting, at most, about 75 EXP a round, and it wasn't because we had an EXP sucker. Hell, if anyone was an EXP sucker, it was me, since I was the highest level in the group.<br><br>I was getting homesick for Windurst. I had been as broke as Paris Hilton's crotch since I started hanging out in San d'Oria, and there would be no way for me to make a decent paycheck without access to my Mog House.<br><br>Lorlithor chose that particular time to mention that he was interested in moving to Windurst, and I volunteered to be his escort. You can imagine my relief when I discovered how <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/033.jpg target=akztarg>non-gay-looking</a> he had become.<br><br>And so we walked from the La Theine Plateau, through the Valkurm Dunes, to Selbina, and took the boat to Mhaura. I did a bit of fishing along the way, as Lorlithor ran around begging people for bait....<br><br>We landed in Mhaura and made the long hike to Windurst as I pointed out various hot spots that I've talked about in the journal - the Shakrami Maze, the Teleport Crags, Sarutabaruta - and eventually got there. It took Lorlithor all of three minutes to decide that he wanted to move to Windurst eventually, and it took me all of three minutes to rake in some cash for the first time in ages.<br><br>The problem is, of course, the cost of moving. NPC's will let you rent a Mog House in a foreign city, but moving there will cost you anywhere from 10K-50K gil, depending on the city's standing in the conquest. Windurst is in second, but it's still a ridiculous sum to ask of a Level 11 Warrior.<br><br>So as he looked around and gazed in awe at the calmness and beauty of Windurst (and get threatened by some Elvaan-hating Taru NPC who threatened to &quot;bite off your kneecaps!&quot;), I reacquainted myself.<br><br>I mentioned in another thread that I had seen a Galka named <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/034.jpg target=akztarg>Frankthetank</a> walking around and one point and - lo and behold - he was fishing outside the Fisherman's Guild.<br><br>&quot;IT'S FRANK THE TANK!&quot; I yelled.<br>&quot;That's me.&quot; he responded.<br>&quot;ONCE IT HITS YOUR LIPS, IT'S SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!&quot;<br>&quot;lol I'll just have one.&quot;<br><br>Yes, I am a dork. But <i>Old School</i> rocks.<br><br>I realized that if I wanted to make some cash, killing monsters in one hit with my Level 17 Red Mage would not be all that effective. So I decided to level up my future subjob - Black Mage, which gets an offensive magic boost at Level 10. I advanced four levels, maxed out my rank points for Rank 2, and made about 2K gil in no time at all.<br><br>But not all is wine and roses... I decided to take my chances with a Crawler, which promptly whooped my little Taru ass when my Stone spell decided to only do about 2 damage. Locke watched the whole episode. The only mage with Raise wasn't impressed by our 500 gil &quot;donation&quot;, so it left me to take the experience penalty.<br><br>Just one problem...<br><br>My home point was still in Selbina.<br><br>I've never felt so many eyes on me at one time. A Level 3 Black Mage walking around in an area meant for six-person parties of Level 15 or higher. The land of one hit kills, enemies with Drain spells, aggro out the ass... and there was this newbie Tarutaru walking around like he owned the place. NPC's wouldn't even talk to me. They called me &quot;little boy&quot; and told me to come back once I had some experience.<br><br>So I took the boat to Mhaura. And already, stuff began to suck when I started fishing and pulled up a sea monster that killed me in one hit. Somebody on the boat finished him off and Raised me (for free, I might add). But right as things looked to be settling down, we got attacked by PIRATES.<br><br>Pirates are mostly a bunch of massively powerful undead monsters. If you hide out under the boat, you're safe, but all the other passengers were ridiculously skilled and had no trouble finishing them off. I did manage to poke my nose outside and get <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/035.jpg target=akztarg>a look at some of the action</a>.<br><br>A high-powered Thief/Ninja named Trigger walked me back to Windurst, letting me switch my homepoint at every possible moment along the way. I got home, regained Level 5, cashed in some items, and called it a night.<br><br>Damn. Pirates. Just when I thought this game could no longer surprise me...</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>

Signet lasts for a really long time, but the many hours of walking and fighting in the Valkurm Dunes exhausted it.<br><br>I was finishing my first San d'Orian quest - retrieving water from a river, which would have been easy except the hot spot is tiny and the river is extremely long - and walking back from the cathedral, I noticed the <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/027.jpg target=akztarg>Windurstian Consul</a>. Forget how heartwarming it is to see the Windurst flag floating on the outside of it. I found somebody on the inside who could sell me Windurst conquest items, cast Signet, and accept crystals for donation.<br><br>Let that be a note to you. Unless you're out in the middle of nowhere doing a high-level quest, you can find all the necessities of home at your nation's foreign consul.<br><br>The consul, however, can't do anything useful like make deliveries or donations. The Auction House will deliver a small number of items to your Mog House wherever it is in the world, but that doesn't solve the cash problem. I don't have my usual sources of income in San d'Oria. No selling spools of silk thread that Crawlers drop, or crawler calculi. No mandragora bud/bird feather 250 gil combos. And no significant quests.<br><br>To make matters worse, there's a lot of really awesome spells coming available. The bread and butter of red mages are the enchanting spells, which imbue your physical attacks with elemental damage. At Level 16, Enthunder - the first of these spells become available... for a couple thousand gil.<br><br>And guess who just became Level 16...<br><br>San d'Oria has one huge advantage over Windurst, though. Windurst - despite being a very organic city - is surrounded by desert and savanna. If there's a tree around, it's usually some sort of sacred, magical tree. Ronfaure and La Theine are lush forests, with ponds, rivers, and other forms of <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/028.jpg target=akztarg>beautiful scenery</a>.<br><br>I got a party invite last night to join a group that was roaming around Valkurm trying to level, and I unexpectedly got stuck in the northwest corner of the La Theine Plateau. I dropped down a small cliff, and couldn't figure out a way back up. Never mind how long it took me to get back up. I did find <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/029.jpg target=akztarg>a nice scenic spot</a> that you couldn't fall from.<br><br>As I was trying to figure my way back into reality, the party got angry at each other and split up. I did make it to Valkurm soon after, and was picked up rather quickly as I fought a Sand Hare on my own. Yes, I can fight those tougher monsters on my own now. It's <a href=HTTP://ffxi.dewm.net/_screens/030.jpg target=akztarg>these five guys</a> that somersaulted me to Level 16 and introduced me to the magic salesmen in Selbina.<br><br>This group had a slightly different party structure. A Ranger was used to pull enemies from long distances with their bow. A Warrior was used to tank. A Ninja was used for additional attack power. Two Red Mages provided the healing and enfeebling. And a Bard provided enhancement magic. I never knew how cool Bards could be until I saw this party. The dude constantly hung back and sung songs.... Within 30 seconds, we all had enhanced physical power, enhanced accuracy, enhanced defense, regenerating health, and the enemy was weakened.<br><br>It was another great party. Not as good as the one I was in the other day because they weren't quite as organized, but still good.<br><br>I plan on staying in San d'Oria until at least Level 18. If I can score the two other subjob quest items before that time, I'll leave immediately after I complete the quest. Otherwise, I'll have to stick around and finish the job. I still haven't quite decided what my subjob would be, but I'm edging towards Black Mage for its enhanced magical attack power, high MP, and Manafont skill, which lets you cast magic without consuming MP.</p>&nbsp;<br>Character:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?28382 target=akztarg>Rentwokay</a> (<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=55 target=akztarg>Seraph</a> server)<br>Linkshell:  <a href=HTTP://www.forum-central.com target=akztarg><span style='color: Green;'><b>ForumCentral</b></span style='color: Green;'></a> Leader, <a href=HTTP://gc.dewm.net target=akztarg><span style='color: Orange;'><b>Garrison Central</b></span style='color: Orange;'></a> Leader<br><br>Spiny Spipi 0/2, Tumbling Truffle 1/1, Ashmaker Gotblut 0/4<br>Prime Avatars 6/11</td></tr>
