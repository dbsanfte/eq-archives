However, paladins and sks cant duel wield, so it would be awesome, but not just invincible.  What if a warrior could use and was duel wielding another uber weapon? Might as well leave the zone when they are there because he would wipe out everything.  Think about it before writing crap about a warrior duel wielding with one of those.

As with Chardok, when you see a mob with a weapon, the effects work on him, as with a the Frenzy camp, he is a bit tougher when he has the FBSS, the item adds the haste to him. so my guess (dont flame me, it might be obvious to you, but not everyone is really quick) that this is just intended to be what he uses, nothing else, no quests or anything else.</p>&nbsp;<br>Williamm<br>Bristlebane server<br>Mith marr<br>56th season<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125547" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125547</a></td></td></tr>
