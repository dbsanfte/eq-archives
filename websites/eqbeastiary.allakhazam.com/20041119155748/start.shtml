<b>04/14/2000</b> Wow, submissions keep rolling in!  It's fantastic, and I've been working as hard as I can, getting the updates in.  Alot of nice <a href=/fresh.shtml>updates</a> have been done.<p>
I wanted to answer one common question, if you're sending images, just send them :)  I prefer bitmaps, so i can crop them and adjust the levels, though feel free to compress the images with zip.  Jpegs are great too, I don't complain.<p>
It's difficult sometime to rememember to give credit for all the submissions, since I've got scripts written which do the updates for me.  So I wanted to publicly thank the following regular contributors: Torlan Bloodsabre for many high-level pics he's sent in; Lias Roxx for some very in-depth research into the Noble hunters in Innothulle Swamp and some lovely information on Upper Guk; Thaylon Doomsayer for the many many factions he's sent in; and everyone else who's sent information in! Thank you.<p>
Oh, a reader wrote in to say that Mitty lives in Kerra Isle.<p>

<b>04/13/2000</b> Many of the factions have had descriptions added.  As well, faction info is starting to flow in, thanks to everyone who's mailed me lists!<p>
As some people have noted, I've started separating certain monsters like orcs into teir multiple tribes .  This is more of a necessity now because of the faction changes.<p>
I've also put a faction drop-down on the menu, which lets you search by faction rather easily.  It looks awful in Netscape but that should be fixed shortly.<p>

<b>04/12/2000</b> I slipped into Kerra Isle a bit this morning, and was able to get some new information on the new layout.  It looks like they've done an excellent job of mixing a Temple of Solusek Ro quest zone with good mid-low level hunting.<p>
Added a bunch of new information to Kerra, but still need to know if Mitty still spawns.  If you've seen her, let me know please.<p>
Of note as well is that (on the test server atleast) the fire goblins in Solusek's Eye, only change one faction.  They and the  Kunark Fire Giants seem to have stopped hating eachother.  If anyone who hunted in Solusek's Eye last night could confirm this for me, it would be great.  It's a bit of a shame, I hate to see one of the more interesting potential stories dissappear.<p>
More updates coming.<p>

<b>04/11/2000</b> I had a slight gamma problem which should be fixed for the images from Ak'Anon.  Also, a number of updates have been made from a disastrous trip I took to the Rathe Mountains.<p>

<b>04/10/2000</b> Well, over the course of the weekend, I got to discover that if there's something near for me to die to, I will die to it ;)<p>
I have also added tonnes of faction info over the weekend, and to the search page, I've added a drop down that lets you browse the factions.  Feel free, or rather invited, to comment away on them.<p>
Thanks to an excellent conversation with a reader who has been collecting faction information for some time, many of the faction descriptions have been updated.<p>

<b>04/07/2000</b> Oh my!!!  This has nothing to do with EQ, but we're obviously all fans of Fantasy here...  There is a 30 second preview of The Lord of The Rings avaliable on the <a href=http://www.lordoftherings.net>official site</a>.  My goodness it looks good *drools*.  See it!<p>
Thanks to excellent reader feedback, I've made tonnes of updates to factions.<p>

<b>04/05/2000</b> I did a bit more work to the new comment viewer, allowing you to choose to save your viewing options if you like.  I'm making these changes because the database is growing at the rate of about 100 comments per day, and I thought it might be nice to allow people to filter the comments.<p>
Some neat stats:  this site currently catalogues over 3500  creatures throughout Norrath, there are some 6000+ comments as well.<p>
I'll try to get a beast update done today too.<p>

<b>04/03/2000</b> Had some spare time over the weekend again, so I beefed up the comments system.  You can now select the order you want to see the comments in, and compress the view if you want.  It should make it easier to browse the comments.<p>
I have no idea if this will work well, please <a href=mailto:illia@nector.com>let me know</a> if you like it, dislike it, or have anything else :)<p>
I've also put in the ability to drop the threshhold of comments you choose to read.  Be warned, that browsing the comments with a threshhold of zero will get all the posts that I've deemed as trolls or offensive.  If de-censoring them results in more work for me, I'll turn off that option.<p>

<b>04/01/2000</b> Happy April Fools Day!.  Finshed an update to Northern Karana which makes the Zone almost complete, without faction info.  Any Guard hunters out there, please feel free to post the faction adjustments for the guards there.<p>

<b>03/31/2000</b> One thing I've always disliked about Netscape is that it waits untill the page can draw in sequence to lay the whole thing out.  In the case of this site, sometimes the loading of the Banner Ads can make it annoying to surf the site.  When the always-bogged ad server slows down, it makes this site load very slowly.<p>
So, as a fix I've put a little button on the left there, which allows you to pick when the ad loads (for most pages).  If the site's loading slowly, try moving the Ads to the bottom of the page.<p>

<b>03/30/2000</b> Made a bunch of updates to faction today, thanks to reader feedback.  I've also added <i>most</i> of the newer gnolls to Paw, but most probably have the level information wrong.<p>
<a href=mailto:illia@nector.com style='text-decoration: none;'>--Illia</a>
<hr size=1>
<b>03/29/2000</b> Yeah, I made an update today which now allows you to collect a bit more information on factions and what effects them. I'm not completely happy with the layout, but would decided to turn up that part of the search to collect reader feedback.  <p>
By clicking on the factions listed under any Monster, you get taken to the faction page for said faction.  Comments are enabled for the faction, and a description is provided (if available).  <a href=mailto:illia@nector.com>Let me know</a> what you think, any and all feedback is appreciated.<p>
Also, I'd like to get <a href=search.shtml?zone=21>Paw</a> updated to the new Monsters, so two questions for people: What's in there now?  And do splitpaw gnolls still exist?<p>

<b>03/24/2000</b> Well, numerous people wrote back in to say "There are NO rogue quests in Halas".  So... as people have been complaining - not only is the banker attached to said rogues; but once he dislikes you, you're through banking there.<p>
Made a few updates as I work on the comment moderation system.<p>
Have a good weekend all!<p>

<b>03/23/2000</b> I've nearly completed Halas.  All quest info from Allakhazam's is linked in to the right people, and I managed to get pictures of most everything in Halas last night.  One thing I am missing is the faction info for completeing quests for the Rogues guild there, if you know of any Halas Rogue quests, please <a href=mailto:illia@nector.com>let me know</a>.<p>

<b>03/22/2000</b> Yeah! It's spring according to the calendar (actually it was a few days ago, but I forgot to notice).<p>
My apologies for a lack of updates, I wrote a new <a href=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/allakhazam/search>search engine</a> for <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ target=_top>Allakhazam's</a>, and that sapped some of the time I had meant to be running around collecting more info.<p>
I have updated most of the rarer spawn info in Cazic Thule and Crushbone.<p>

<b>03/19/2000</b> Well... no more writing code on St. Patricks Day for me.  I left a small bug in the comments code which prompted most people to leave many posts.  It should be fixed now.<p>
Thanks to reader feedback, there have been numerous <a href=/fresh.shtml>updates</a> to the database.<p>
<a href=mailto:illia@nector.com style='text-decoration: none;'>--Illia</a>
<hr size=1>
<b>03/17/2000</b> I got ansy waiting 'till I could start soaking myself in Guiness, so I added a bunch of rare spawns to the beastiary, they should be listed under <a href=/fresh.shtml>recent updates</a>.<p>
I'd also like to add my voice to the chorus of congratulations for the Paladin named Musk from Tunare, good work to you and your friends.<p>
In honour of St. Patrick's Day (Guiness Appreciation Day), the site is green today!!!  Happy St. Patricks Day, may you have the luck 'o the Irish with your spawns.<p>

<b>03/15/2000</b> After digging through the comments, I've been finding some interesting discussions on some general topics appearing in the strangest places.  As I get time, I'll try to move these to the message board, so they're easier to find.  The first I moved was a response to whether or not <a href=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/message.shtml?mid=95313930212253>Dragons and giants</a> can be stunned or interrupted.<p>
I'm going to try to move general discussions like this to the message boards, since soon I'll be putting in a new comment viewing system which tries to present the comments in a slightly more condensed manner (newest first, older ones are collapsed).<p>
Again, quite a few small <a href=fresh.shtml>changes and additions</a> to the beastiary.<p>
