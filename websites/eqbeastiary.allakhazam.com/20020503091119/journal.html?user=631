	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is not the most exciting story I have written to date, but I promise the next installment will be more interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, please comment either pro or con.  I enjoy the feedback and actually appriciate the constructive critism type.<br><br>Part 20.<br><br>As the sun rose over the plains of The Overthere, I cursed at myself for being caught sleeping and quickly reached for my weapon while trying to locate the person behind the voice.  It was not hard to find the source.  Standing in front of me, with her hand on her hips and a terse frown, stood another Iksar.  &quot;Such language, broodling.  But from the look of you, I would say that you have had a difficult evening.&quot;  <br><br>Eventually, I managed to stand.  Pieces of mud and grass fell off my armor onto the ground as I straightened up.  &quot;My apologies if I have offended.  I was surprised to met anyone out in these wilds.&quot;  My sword moved ever so slightly to the ready.<br><br>The other Iksar's eyes did not miss the movement.  The frown turned into a slight smile.  &quot;You have nothing to fear from me, honorable knight, unless you fear a meal and chance to rid yourself of the mud you collected from the waterhole, yesterday.&quot;   I frowned at the reminder of the previous day's activities but bowed my head in thanks and followed the other Iksar to her camp.  She asked me the story behind my muddy appearance as we walked and I told her the story of my race with the Sarnaks.  &quot;You are lucky.  The knights of the Sarnaks are powerful in their own right.  I am surprised you did not end up as a trophy in their fort.&quot;<br><br>I nodded my head in agreement.  &quot;I was taught to not take any foe lightly.  I will not misjudge the resourcefulness of the Sarnaks again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye, Knight.  That is a good plan, if you wish to continue to breath.&quot;<br><br>We continued our trek.  &quot;I have not introduced myself.  I am...&quot;<br><br>Waving a hand in the air, &quot;You are Shrikke, Shadowknight of Fear, fleeing from the wrath of the cursed Necromancers.  On your way to Velious, if I have heard correctly.&quot;  I opened my mouth to respond, but she continued.  &quot;I was told to look out for you by a mutual friend.  I, by the way, am Klok G'Rshai.  I handle all Iksar commerce in the Overthere, with the Haggle Baron's blessing.&quot;  She stopped and turned to look at me.  &quot;And I am at anyone's service who has enough coin to buy my wares or working toward the good of the Empire.&quot;  She turned back around and continued to walk. <br><br>We continued on for a while and soon came to the edge of the ocean.  Upon the shore was her campsite.  A large tent and a well-used fire pit showed that this had been Klok G'Rshai's home for quite a while.   She started preparing food while I jumped into the ocean with my armor still on to wash away the previous day's adventure.  As I came out of the waves, clean and refreshed, the smell of warm food filled my lungs as I walked back to the camp.  I sat down, grabbed a rag and started wiping down my armor.<br><br>G'Rshai handed me a bowl of steaming broth and sat down across the fire from me.  I thanked her with a nod of my head.  &quot;You don't talk much, knight.&quot; <br><br> It was my turn to smile.  &quot;I have been thinking on a few questions, good Klok.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What questions are those?&quot;<br><br>&quot;First, to whom do you sell your wares?  There are only Dark Elves and Sarnaks in this part of the Kunark.  You must not do much business unless you have an agreement with them and of course, the Haggle Baron would only have you out here if you could turn a profit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know the Haggle Baron well, I think,&quot; she replied.  &quot;Continue, please.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Second, you do not have a lot of supplies laying around and the tent is large, but not large enough to store a great amount of inventory.  You must deal in items that are less substantial than food and water.  I am I correct?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, that is a good assessment for the most part.  Information is truly my main commodity.  The Haggle Baron is not interested in politics unless it interferes with profit.  So, I sell the information I can to whoever has the coin to spend.  The Sarnaks and the Dark Elves, Trolls and Ogres all know that I am a reliable resource and allow me to continue to do business as I see fit.&quot;<br><br>Nodding my head, &quot;I understand.&quot;<br><br>The rest of the meal continued in silence.  Afterwards, I cleaned my bowl and started to re-pack my equipment.  I soon noticed my backpack was missing.  I quickly scanned the camp and was about to become concerned when G'Rshai came out of her tent holding a strange looking bag.  &quot;You are looking for your things?&quot; she stated.  &quot;I have packed them in this.&quot;  I took the bag from her and noticed that it was much lighter than I would have expected.  Upon closer inspection, I could tell the material it was made of was magical in nature.  &quot;It is a bag made of the skins of the Evil Eyes that reside in the bowels of the Froglok stronghold.  It floats as the Eyes themselves float, making caring the bag much easier than a normal backpack.&quot;<br><br>I bowed, &quot;This is very generous.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is nothing.  The Dark Elf who traded it to me was starving.  I made a good profit from him.&quot;  I put on the rest of my armor and thanked the Klok for her help.  &quot;You are welcome, Shrikke.  Before you leave, could I ask you a couple of questions?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will answer if I can.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You have seen the Vampire in the Tower of Necromancy?&quot;<br><br>I stiffed slightly wondering where this was going.  &quot;Yes, I have seen him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can you describe him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I could, but it would be from my own perspective and I doubt you would be able to deduct who he was before death.&quot;  I strapped my sword to my side, &quot;However, I could give you a name if you like.&quot;<br><br>Her breath caught, &quot;You know his name?  How?&quot;<br><br>I smiled, &quot;Because I was there when he failed the Test.  His name is Hapzass.  He was taken from the Test at the time of his death but I know not how.&quot;  Finishing the last buckle on my sheath.  &quot;Now you know his name as well.&quot;  I looked up and the Klok was not smiling.  &quot;I hope it does you some good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is more than I had hoped.&quot;  She sat down on the log next to the fire.  &quot;Now I have some information for you.  You will need to get on the Bloated Belly at the docks of the outpost to leave this place.  The guards around the dock are a combination of dark elves and undead.  It will be difficult to board the ship without one or the other group seeing you.  However, not long ago, two dark elves passed this way.  One was a knight like you, the other a thief bound in the chains of a slave.  She was to be taken back to her homeland for some crime and did not seem pleased about the prospect of returning.  She might be made to help you board the boat, if you could...persuade...the other dark elf to release her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Which way did they go?&quot;  The Klok pointed in the direction of the outpost.   &quot;My thanks.  I will see you again, I hope.&quot;  I turned and started running to the outpost.<br><br><br>Good hunting all.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Apr  5 17:47:39 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, it may not be the most exciting story - as you say - but it is certainly intruiging (sp?). It seems that you are building up to something - which I hope is certainly the case - and leaving room for more of the back story to come into play.<br><br>For instance - while Shrikke may be off adventuring like any other EQ toon, he still has a background that haunts him. I wonder - why is the Haggle Baron interested in the vampire? What will the name of the vampire enable the Haggle Baron to do? How will passing this information on affect Shrikke inj times to come?<br><br>Exciting in the sense of conflict and adventure? Maybe not. Exciting in the sense of &quot;Oooo...what's gonna happen&quot;?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>February and March where tough.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have finally caught up on real life to dedicate a bit more energy to the story of our growing Shadowknight.  I hope that you enjoy this next installment and as always, please don't be afraid to post comment and suggestions.  Good hunting all in the land of Norrath.<br><br>Part 19.<br> <br>As I moved out through the trees, into the pass that leads to the place know as The Overthere, my eyes and thoughts were drawn to the statue of the Iksar warrior that guards the entrance to Warslilks Woods.  It had been built at the height of our power, when the Iksars knew no enemies, only slaves.  We had ruled Kunark then with steel, claw, magic and, most importantly, order.  <br><br>Does that surprise you, the fact that order was so much a part of our society?   Of course it does.  You have listened to the stories told by others who fear us, stories that tell of my people as savage heartless creatures with no thought except destroy and enslave those around us.  Those stories misrepresent the true intent of the Iksar Empire.  Do you think that a society that was simply bent on destruction and chaos could have so completely civilized a continent?  Look at the structures that dot the landscape throughout Kunark.  Look at the roads and the waterways that tie the whole of Kunark together. Not since the Combine Empire has there been such building and architecture.  Are these the works of a people who yearned for death or for simply a better life?  Of course we enslaved the giants, goblins and the other lesser races that infested our Empire.  How could we leave these disruptive and violent creatures free, when they endangered not only themselves but also the Empire with their chaotic behavior?  Instead we used their strength and added it to our own.  Kunark was safe, clean, and orderly while we ruled.  However, we have fallen far as a people since that time.  Now the continent is in ruin and dangerous and falling victim to the forces of chaos, specifically to the elves that have invaded our shores.  Dark Elves, High Elves...it matter not to the Iksar.  Both are agents of chaos.  Dark Elves with their need to glory in death, pain and debauchery make no plans for the future except those that gratify their most basic needs, irrespective of the consequences to themselves or those in their own society.  In contrast, the High Elves have a preoccupation with allowing all beings to follow a  &quot;natural&quot; path in the name of allowing freedom.  Both paths lack purpose.  Both paths lack discipline.  Both paths eventually lead to death and chaos.   Someday, we will burn both their outposts to the ground and show them the errors of their paths.<br><br>When would that time come?  When would my race regain respect?  &quot;Questions for another time,&quot; I thought, as I stepped off the hill and made my way into the rolling, grassy plains of The Overthere.<br><br>The sun was setting as I started this part of my journey and I knew that I would need a place to rest for the night.  As the night truly began, I picked the base of a large boulder to set up camp.  I did not build a fire.  Sarnaks and the Dark Elves roamed the plains, and I did not want to give them something to investigate.  That night I was awoken by the sound of shuffling around my camp.  As I lay on the ground, I peered into the darkness, hoping to see some evidence of what was moving in the night.  And although I could hear and smell something out around my camp, yet I could see nothing.   Thinking that maybe a dark elf or other enemy had cast a spell of invisibility and was moving in to ambush me, I leaped up from my prone position and brought my sword to the ready.  The Dark Reaver, removed from its sheath began to cast an eerie glow over the area.  To my surprise, it was not an enemy or some sort of creature that had awoken me, but a plant.  I had heard of the plants in The Overthere that walked, but I had only half believed the story until this moment.   If the tales I had heard where true, the plants where dangerous only if attacked directly and tended to ignore just about everything else.  Why then, did this plant suddenly stop and turn towards me as I held my sword at the ready?  With my sword still on guard, I moved towards the creature and inspected the sharp thorns that covered its surface and still the creature did not move.  As I moved away back to the base of the rock, I could hear another plant heading directly towards my camp.  It soon joined the first in a silent watch over me.  The two plants did not move and after a while I figured it was safe enough to sleep.  I sheathed my sword and as darkness rushed into the area, I could hear the plants start shuffling away.  &quot;Why would they leave now?&quot; I wondered.  It struck me as I placed my hand on my sword.   I pulled out the burnt out lightstone that still hung around my next and held it over my head.   I brought power to the stone and a white clear light covered the area around my camp.  I could see the plants reverse their movement and come back to my camp.  &quot;They seek light,&quot; I thought.  I was amused by the behavior of these plants.  What series of events had the hated Shissar enacted to give these plants the drive to seek out light?  Within a short time, I had drawn more than twenty of the creatures to my camp, all of them standing dutifully in the light of the stone.  I soon grew bored and knew that the light would eventually draw more then these very odd plants.  I released the power to the stone and heard the plants begin to wander out onto the plains. <br><br>It was lucky, for one of the plants performed an invaluable service to me by shuffling over a large prone object in the grass and inflicted enough damage to make it yelp.  The sarnak knowing that it had given itself away, leapt to its feet and dodging the mobile plants rushed to attack me.  It was not fast enough.  I cast a spell of fear upon the charging beast and smiled as the look of excitement upon the sarnak&amp;#8217;s face changed to a look of terror.  As the beast tried to flee through the plants, it must have stuck one hard enough to anger it.  The plant instantly began whiping the sarnak with those deadly thorns.  I sat back on my rock and watched as the plant struck the fleeing beast over and over again.  With another spell, I cast a curtain of darkness and slowed the sarnak down to allow the plant plenty of opportunity to deal with this creature that had tried to ambush me.  Eventually, the sarnak worked through the terror of the fear spell and started battling the plant, but it was soon over.  The last thing the sarnak felt was me tapping its life force, then death.<br><br>Although this battle was an easy victory, I knew that I needed to leave the area quickly.  This was a young sarnak, recruited recently by its elders to the ways of battle.  One of those elders would be missing this one soon enough.  I looted the body of a few coins, gathered my pack and headed away from the stone as quickly as I could.  I walked through most of the night and eventually stopped under a lone tree on a side of a hill to sit and rest.  As the sun rose on a sleepless night, I could see in the distance running my direction a group of sarnaks.  Thinking these were foolish creatures, I cast a spell and stepped into the shadows of the plains and moved a ways away from the tree.  I would wait until they passed by and simply head in a different direction.  I knew I was in trouble when the largest of the sarnaks got to the tree I had been sitting under and sniffed around its base like a scale wolf, then pointed in my direction.<br><br>I began to run.<br><br>Staying invisible, I made my way over rocks and hills, hoping that the creatures would lose my trail.  It was by the luck of the gods that I came to the shallow, muddy pond.  I quickly ran through the watering hole and out the other side, making sure that a trail went into the high grass on the other side.  I then, carefully, retraced my steps back to the pond and allowed myself to sink into the mud at the bottom.  It was not long before I heard the sound of running sarnak feet as they ran past the pond and back into the plains.  Persistence seems to be a sarnak virtue for they came back to the pond several times that day, to try to pick up the trail.  None of them entered the mud hole except to drink.  So, it seems I spent the second day in the plains of Overthere in a mud hole only coming up for air as needed, then sinking back out of sight.<br><br>It was very dark and I had not seen any sign of the sarnaks for quite a while before I came out of that hole.  I was cold and muddy as I dragged myself and my backpack out of the slime of the pond.  Again, I could not light a fire, so I huddled against another stone and listened to the sounds of the night.  I must have finally dosed off to sleep, because I was surprised by the voice that spoke perfect Iksar.  &quot;Wake up, Knight of Shadow...your day has just begun, I think.&quot;<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Mar 29 10:46:12 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2> Hi, This is my first time posting but I have a proplem about people taking advantage of newbies with enchanted items, And now with new focus items it's worse. I once was almost in big truble because of theese focus items, Lukly I didn't pay for them if I had I would have been In HUGE trouble! you see the night after the new patch I found some packages on the ground and dicided to investigate. I picked them up and found that they were braclets and rings. Being better than my current ones I equiped them. I almost sold my previous braclets when I became link dead. When I was back on the right before I clicked the trade button I realised the rings and bracelets dissapeard. I was almost a victim of loosing soe good equip, and now newbies have been. So if your a person that can enchant theese items then make sure that you clearly state the'll disapeer after loging. Don't let newbies be the victim because you used to be just like them belive it or not.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lord Celris TreeWalker Enchanter of the World</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am sorry for the time I have not posted.  I have been in the middle of re-modeling my home and the home of my Mom and have not had much energy to write.  However, I've got another tale for you.  One that is very scary because it happened in RL.  My Mom is doing a huge (&gt;900 ft^2) re-model to her house.  The original plans (which took almost 9 months to get approval through the county office) called for the contractor to take off 2/3 off the existing roof and put in new trusses.  The front 1/3 of the roof was to be left alone.  This was signed off by the building inspectors.<br><br>So, we move forward in time to the point where the new roof has been build.  Plywood is on top of the trusses ready for the shingles.  The whole project had been inspected twice up to this point, including the 1/3 of the roof that was supposed to be left untouched.  It was at this critical point that the county inspector decided that the whole roof issue was suddenly a problem and that the whole roof needed to be removed and re-built even though it was build exactly to the plans that the county had approved.  The contractor agreed to pay for the cost of the new trusses and my Mom agreed to pay for the cost of labor.  New trusses where then designed, shipped and installed at a cost of $10,000 over the course of 3 weeks and 4 storm events.<br><br>The contractor, suggested to my Mom that she contact her insurance agent.  Sure enough, her homeowner's insurance stated that if during the replacement of a roof, if the structure was found to not meet code that the insurance company would assist with the cost of bringing the roof structure up to code.  The insurance agent simply needed a statement from the contrator and the county building inspector that the structure was not up to code.  The contractor and building inspector agreed to write such a letter and so the project has moved forward...until the phone call yesterday.<br><br>We assumed everything was fine, so my Mom was surprised when the insurance agent called her at work yesterday asking again why she had to replace her roof.  She again explained what had happened...that the building inspector had required them to replace the roof after determining that the exsisting roof was not up to specification.  The insurance agent then asked her if she was SURE that she just didn't what to update the roof...asked if maybe she was the one who asked for the contractor to replace the roof.  My Mom was confused and replied why would she ask the contractor to tear off a roof that had already been built?  The extra cost, the damage from the storm to the rest of the house...why would she have ASKED the contractor to re-build the roof?<br><br>The insurance agent agreed and explained that my Mom's story and the contractor's story matched.  However, the country building inspector's letter stated that he was not responsible for the re-building of the roof.  That my Mom and the contractor where responsible for making that decision.<br><br>My Mom, then called the contractor, who did not sound surprised in the change of story by the inspector and stated that he would talk to the inspector about re-writing the letter and for my Mom not to worry about it.<br><br>I think this is a case of local government run amok.  I understand a need for build codes and regulations.  I understand the need to enforce those codes.  Heck, I work for a state agency and am responsible for enforcing a number of regulatory issues.  However, I am responsible for the decisions I make concerning those areas.  These county building inspectors not only where incompetent concerning the approval of plans for the original re-model, but then tried to say that they were not responsible for the actions they forced.<br><br>In a country that is based on the words, &quot;Of the people, by the people and For the people&quot; it is unfortunate that petty officials try so hard to screw the people.<br><br>/Rant off<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've had this story in my head for a bit, but haven't had time to finish it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you enjoy it.  <br><br>Just to let those of you that read this journal into my RL a little bit, I am a father of two children under 3 years old, and both of them have been sick for bit.  Nothing serious, but they both have not let my wife and I sleep very much over the last couple of weeks.  So, if the story is not up to snuff, I beg your indulance :-)<br><br>As always...please comment or offer suggestion.<br><br>Part 18.<br><br>Most races, if they where honest with themselves, would agree with the statement that death is something to be feared.  However, I have found the soft skinned races truly don't fear death.  They fear the pain just before death.  The feel of a blade sliding between one's ribs or agony of a spell ending a life in a mass of fire, blood and pain, this is what most people actually fear.   What happens after death, in my experience, doesn't concern most.  Everyone understands that the body goes back into the cycle and one's essences become part of whichever god one has followed through the course of life.  This seems on the surface like a reasonable and somewhat pleasurable ending, to bask in the power and knowledge of the gods.  However, this system terrifies me.  It is not that I fear joining my lord, Cazic Thule, or fear becoming part of his will, but that I will cease to have a will of my own.  I fear that once I have died, I will never again personally affect the world.  All chances for personal improvement, power, fame and greatness will be engulfed in the overpowering presence of my god.  Because of this ending to life, I take my life seriously.  I do not spend my time in idle amusements or frivolous vices.   Let those around me play and love and waste their days.<br><br>Death comes to all, but it will not find me wishing I had not reached my potential.<br><br>I walked out of the Field of Bones into Warslilks Woods just before the sun had dropped below the horizon.  It was hard to leave my home behind.  Hard to leave my people at a time when I knew they were in danger of being overcome but the mad plans of the necromancers.  I also still felt the lost of Squire Mharkas.  She was not only the one who showed me my path, but was also the only link to by past that I knew about.  I had not had an opportunity to ask her about my parents before her execution.  I had plenty of opportunity, but never took the time.  I smiled as I saw her in my mind's eye explaining this final lesson,   &quot;Broodling, don't fail to focus on your real priorities, and certainly don't procrastinate in the implementation of those priorities.   Some opportunities only happen once in a lifetime.  Miss them and they will be your undoing.&quot;  Well, I would take this last lesson given to me by the Squire and focus on my ultimate goal:  To come back to Cabilis and bring down the power of the Brood of Kotiz.  They had held the reins of the Empire for too long and had ceased to put their own welfare above the welfare of the people.  And now, they had thrown our lot in with the Vampires.  The undead that walk the Castle of Karnor should have been enough of warning of what could happen when dealing with those who do not have life, but still live.<br><br>These images ran through my mind as I walked the shady under growth of Warslilks Woods.  However, the image of Master Xydoz slowly sliding down an impalement pole was interrupted by an all too familiar sound of breaking limbs and upturned bushes coming towards me   I came to a halt and watched as the Brute walked past me.  I could tell the beast was aware of my presents, as its sulking eyes never left mine as he traveled past.   The Brutes, although strong and violent if provoked, were not dangerous if they were simply left alone to pursue their own paths.  As he disappeared into the undergrowth, I turned to gaze at the path of broken foliage left in the wake of the beast.  Maybe I didn't hear the goblin approach because of the Brute or maybe because of my own pre-occupation with future events, but on the path of fallen limbs stood a large armored goblin.  Now, a single goblin is of no consequence.  I could, even then, destroy all except the strongest goblins that roamed these woods.  However, goblins have a habit of traveling in groups and a seemingly easy encounter could suddenly turn into a mad dash through the undergrowth with a tribe of goblins nipping on your heels.<br><br>The goblin, known, as a battlemaster among it own kind, moved swiftly towards me, arms swinging wildly.  With my sword at the ready, I cast a spell of darkness to slow and hurt the charging fiend.  Unfortunately, I did not have the time I needed to complete the spell before he slammed into me and disrupted my concentration and my spell.  Rocking on my heals and swearing at myself for not judging the goblin's speed better, I was forced to take a couple of glancing, and yet painful, blows to my armor before I could disengage myself from the flaying beast.  I managed to dodge an overhand swing and put enough distance between the battlemaster and myself to bring the Dark Reaver to bear.  I swung the weapon, simply to give myself a moment to regroup, when the Dark Reaver's true power became evident.  I barely scratched the goblin, merely broke the skin of the battlemaster, when suddenly I felt a rush of power.  The sword had absorbed the strength of the goblin and had given it to me.  The goblins features suddenly changed from excitement to fear.  I quickly brought the sword back around to finish the creature, but hit nothing but air.  The goblin had run and was quickly making its way through the woods.  I gave chase, knowing it would bring friends...many friends...to track me down, making my movement through these woods almost impossible. <br><br>There is a certain excitement about knowing that you have a foe running for its very existence, a specific thrill about making an enemy relies that it can do nothing to defeat you and chose to run for his life.  Do not confuse this emotion with the bloodlust of the Dark Elves or the brutal gratification that trolls and ogres find when they reduce another to a pool of matted hair and blood.  An Iksar doesn't find satisfaction in the simple death of other creatures, but the removal of obstacles that stand between them and their goals.  If that obstacle happens to be the death of an enemy or the destruction of a city or the acquisition of a powerful magic item after a long search, the satisfaction is the same.<br><br>I had almost caught the fleeing goblin when the spells hit me.  First, a blast of ice struck my side, throwing me off my feet.  In spite of the numbing pain, I tumbled with the force of the blast and came back up on my feet facing this new threat.   I viewed not one but two new creatures, both goblin magic users.  The second goblin caster was just completeing a spell and I suddenly felt myself tire and sag under the feeling that I should give up this fight, that sleep would be a better course of action.  I fought the sensation and slowly raised my weapon to defend myself, when the fleeing battlemaster returned to the fight.  I dodged the battlemaster's blows while taking damage from the two goblin casters.  I was going to lose this fight.  I had but one option, a spell that I had very recently bought but had little skill in performing.  I swung my sword in a broad arc making the battlemaster retreat far enough give me the opportunity to cast a spell of my own.  As I struggled with the incantation, another spell of ice stuck me and the battlemaster rushed in an attempt to interrupt my thoughts.  It would have looked to anyone watching that the goblins had succeeded in defeating me as I fell lifeless to the ground.   The goblins shrieked in their excitement and rushed my fallen body, quickly binding my hands and feet together.  Two of them threw me on their shoulders as the other reached down to pick up my fallen weapon.  I still smile at the memory of the screams and the blacken fingers that resulted from the goblin picking up the sword of a Shadowknight.  The goblin threw the weapon to the ground cursing and nursing his hand.  His two companions laughed and pointed at the ensuing wounds, almost dropping me off their shoulders.  The incident, I can only imagine, was brought up continuously as we made our way back to the goblin camp, as randomly the damaged goblin would suddenly start howling and screaming at whatever comments where passing between the three of them.  Unfortunately, I only know three words in goblin.  Two of the words are curses; the third is the word for food.  I hadn't heard the third word yet, but even in this pseudo state of death, knew I was in real danger of becoming an entree.  <br><br>Despite the bumpy ride, my Iksar regenerative powers had nearly brought be back to full health by time the group had reached the goblin camp.  Ten or fifteen goblins ran out to meet the small hunting party, all of them screaming and howling at the group who had defeated a lone Iksar.  My body was thrown next to a hut as the goblins that had defeated me started to tell the story of their battle.  For some odd reason, the story took much longer than the actual battle and I doubt the accuracy of the tail they told.  However, I figured the story was almost completed when one of them pointed at the hand of other and the group that had gathered laughed as one and started yelling at the unfortunate goblin that had touched my weapon.  The laugher stopped suddenly as a large goblin stepped out of the hut where my body lay.   I knew this goblin.  He had been the leader the tribe of goblins that inhabited Warslilks Woods for many years, and was desperately wanted dead by the rulers of Cabilis.  He was Grachnist the Destroyer.   And unfortunately, he looked almost happy.   As he stepped out, the other goblins took a half a step back from their leader.   He made a gruff comment to the group that had brought be to camp, then turned and knelt next to my seemingly lifeless corpse.  He took a dagger from his belt and cut the ropes that bound my hand and feet.  He then rolled me on to my back, and lifted one of my arms so he could examine my hand.   It was at this point, as I stared blankly into the sky, I thought my eyes where deceiving me. The hands of this large goblin resembled my hands, but they were not his hands, they where gloves.  Gloves made out of the scales and claws of Iksars.   I knew not how he had fashioned them, but I knew that if I did not leave soon that I would become very intimate with the process.<br><br>He laughed and dropped my arm.  He motioned for two goblins to grab me and take me into his hut.  The goblins picked me up, took me into his hut, and dropped me on a large bloody stone that sat in the middle of the room.  Then, fortunately, they left the hut and me by myself.  I brought myself out of my feigned death and began casting a spell of transportation.  The spell is useful, but unreliable in the distance it carries you.  I hoped it was far enough this time.  The goblins where alerted by the sound of casting, but not even Grachnist was fast enough to get in into the hut before I stepped through to a different location.  I would have not survived the experience without the help of the goblin screams for I displaced myself fairly close to where a guard was standing, fortunately he was already moving towards camp to see what all the screaming was about.  I calmly cast another spell that I had recently bought, one that allowed me to step into the shadows of Warslilks Woods and disappear from my fate as goblin armor.<br><br>I waited until daybreak to circle back and get my sword.  I would not have thought the goblins capable of subtlety, but as came close to the clearing where I had been overpowered by the goblins, there sleeping in a tree was the goblin battlemaster with the burnt hand.  He had figured I would be back for my sword, but with the coming of the dawn, had fallen asleep in the tree.  I searched the surrounding area for others, but did not find any.  I assume that the goblin figured he could take an unarmed Iksar by himself.  He was a foolish goblin.  Still blending with the shadows, I picked up my sword that was still lying on the ground where it had been left from the night before.  My cloak of shadows disappeared as my hand touched its hilt, but I was not concerned.   I walked quietly to the tree where the goblin slept and with a long swing of my Reaver, cut the branch where the goblins sat.  With a crashing of limbs and a howl, the goblin landed on his back.  I stepped on this throat before he regained his breath and brought my sword to the ready.  He stopped struggling when he saw that I did not instantly strike.  &quot;Goblin, do you know any of my speech&quot; I asked.  He looked at me blankly.  I continued with my language lesson by pointing to myself.  &quot;My name is Shrikke.  Do you understand...Shrikke?&quot;  After a couple of minutes and many repeats of my name, a look of understanding came across the goblins face.  He pointed at me with his dirty chipped claw and repeated my name.  I smiled and nodded my head.  Then with two swings of my sword, I cut off both of his hands.  He wailed in pain as the Dark Reaver not only sliced through his wrists, but also robbed him of his strength.  He was bleeding to death, so I cast a healing spell to stop him from dying.  The spell weaken me slightly, but the lose was unimportant compared to the task I had planned for this particular goblin.  I lifted my foot from his throat and pulled him to his feet.  He stood up, looking at his bloody stumps.  I then repeated my language lesson.  I picked up both of his hands and showed him the lifeless forms.  One, to my slight amusment was still slightly backened.  &quot;Shrikke...tell Grachnist that this was done by Shrikke.  Do you understand?  Shrikke.&quot;  The name of the goblin leader brought a light of recognition to the face of the goblin.  I pushed him away from me and he looked over his shoulder.  I lifted my sword again and the goblin battlemaster got the hint and started to run.  I saw him disappear the forest and smiled.  I quickly recast a spell and stepped back into the shadows of Warslilks.  <br><br>The rest of that week, I hunted within shadows of Warslilks Woods for goblins.  Many of them returned to their camp without their hands and the name of Shrikke on their lips.  I assume that Grachnist will remember my name when I return to finish my collection.<br><br>/ooc For some reason...when I import this from Word, the parenthese and apostropies turn into some other characters.  Anyone know why?<br><br>Good hunting all...see ya in Norrath.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Jan 25 15:09:33 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Everyone, back up on your chairs...at least those who remember Shrikke :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I am back.  The holidays are over and end of year stuff is finally done.  I have started a new series of stories for Shrikke that I hope you enjoy.  As always, please comment if you have any opinions on content or writing style.  I have thick skin...I can take it :-)<br><br>Good hunting all...see ya in Norrath.<br><br>Part 17.<br><br>All was still in the hall of the necromancers as I pulled my Khukri out of the chest of Squire Mharkas and saw the light dim slowly from her eyes.   As I knelt beside her, watching the blood pool around her body, I bowed my head and asked that Cazic-Thule welcome and honor the soul that he was soon to receive.  I understood that I had no choice but to kill the Squire, but unlike some, I was not joyful in the fact that I had witnessed, nay participated, in the downfall of my mentor.  My meditations were interrupted by the voice of Master Xydoz.  You have done an excellent job, Shadowknight.  I was surprised that the Arch Duke sent you to perform the ritual for us.   It has always been that the privilege of executing a traitor has fallen to the guild to which they belong, but is it unusual for the ritual to be performed by someone so...let us say close...to the prisoner. He snapped his hands and motioned for the page to come and remove the body.<br><br>I looked up from my prayer from under my banded helm, into the eyes of the page.  I assume that the look on my face conveyed the fact that if the page touched this body, I would surly kill him.  He suddenly stopped and slowly backed away from where I was knelling.  Quietly, I spoke, &quot;This body is not yours to use as you see fit, Master.  She was a Crusader of the Greenmist and I will take her back to my guild for burial.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, you are wrong, Shadowknight.  She had no guild.  She was a traitor to the empire and a danger to those she taught.&quot;  I closed my eyes as he spoke trying to control my rage. He continued, &quot;She had no edict to teach magic.  Only we, the Brood of Kotiz, have been given the charge, from the time of the Emperor, to teach magic to our people.  She broke that law and deserved this ending.  Now, give us the body to keep as an example to what happens to those who fail to follow the law of our people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All you say may be true, Master.&quot;  Still knelling beside the body of Squire Mharkas, I sheathed my Khukri and picked the body of my teacher.   I stood and turned toward the Master as I held the body. &quot;Or it may be that the Brood of Kotiz has used the responsibility given to them by the Emperor to gain power for themselves at the expense of their own people.  The Emperor made it your responsibility to teach our people magic, not to hoard it for yourselves only to dispense it at your own choosing.  It was not Squire Mharkas that failed her people, but you and those who would sacrifice the greatness of their own race for personal glory.&quot;<br><br>The Master's face clouded over with rage, &quot;You dare talk to a guardian of the Iksar in such a manner?  You will wish you had died before you came out of your egg, Shadowknight.&quot;  Master Xydoz began to cast a spell.  He was a powerful user of magic.  I would have died had I not had activated the circlet that was on my head and faded from view before he could complete his spell.   The page made a feeble attempt to block the door, but did not really slow my progression as I exited the hall. <br><br>I ran through the Tower of Necromancy with the body of the Squire cradled in my arms looking for an easy exit from the hall of death.  I ran down a set of stairs, only to be met by a group of necromancers and their pets coming the opposite direction.  Most of them passed by where I stood without seeing me.  I thought I was safe until the last figure in the group, a hooded form, suddenly stopped and turned toward me.  A voice I had heard before quietly resonated from under the cloak.  &quot;Shrikke?  It is good to see you again.  You who is responsible for the form I now wear.&quot;  The cloaked figure pulled back his hood.   Standing before me stood the form of Hapzass, the broodling Necromancer Larriz and I had killed in order to join a clutch during the Test.   He was older and taller than when I had last seen him, but the greatest change had come in the paleness of his scales and the two long fangs that protruded from the front of his mouth.  &quot;Last time I saw you, I had failed the Test.  Let see now if you can pass my test, broodling.&quot;  I was unable to think for a moment.  A vampire...an Iksar vampire.  This had not been seen for ages and even then had ended badly.  I ripped myself back to the present.  Hapzass was smiling and moving towards me and I could hear the sounds of others coming back down the stairs.   Again, I knew death was about to fall upon me if I did not move.  I had but one option.   Drawing upon the fear that fuels the soul of a Shadowknight, I unleashed my Touch of Harm upon the rushing vampire.  I lost the shadows that surrounded me as magic ripped through the body of Hapzass.  He screamed as every part of his body felt the wrath of the Shadowknight.  Knowing that the pain would not last and knowing that I would be dead if I did not leave the tower quickly, I rushed to my right, ran down the flight of stairs and hurled the body I carried and myself through the open window at the bottom of the landing.  The fall was long and dark, but I was relieved when I hit the canal and the safety of the water.  Without coming up for air, I swam for East Cabilis dragging the body of the Squire behind me.  No one followed me in the canal, but I knew that I would not be spending any more time in the Tower of Necromancy.  I did not know it until that moment, but I had made a very bad enemy, an enemy with a very long memory.<br><br>I managed to drag the dead body out of the canal and into the temple of the Shadowknights.  Lord Gikzic was waiting for me as I stepped through the teleporter. He didn't say a word, but took the body of Squire Mharkas and laid it upon a table.  He then turned to me, &quot;I am glad you are alive, Shrikke.  Already, we have received a command from the Necromancers that you are to be sent back to the Tower of Necromancy immediately for trial.  I believe the charges say something about heresy and the unprovoked attack upon one of their members.&quot;<br><br>I nodded my head and handed him the Circlet of Shadows he had lent to me, &quot;They are correct in their charges, but not complete in their details, Lord.&quot;  I explained completely what had happened in my time at the tower.  &quot;They wanted to keep the body of the Squire.  I'm sure that they would have used it for the same dark purposes that created the Vampire Hapzass, Lord.  The Necromancers are moving in a direction that endangers us all.  Can we do nothing about it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shrikke, go away&quot;  I blinked, twice.  What was he saying to me?  &quot;You are still young and the enemies that you face are beyond you.  I will say that I have not seen you.  I will say that you escaped out of the city before we could send you back to that pit of death.&quot;  He put his hand on my shoulder. &quot;If you want to truly influence the path of your people.  If you truly want to kill those who would destroy you, then go...grow strong in the arts of the Shadowknight.  Then comeback and face these vipers and bring them death.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where should I go, Lord?  There is no place an Iksar is welcome.  Do I become like the bandits that roam the wilds of Kunark?&quot;<br><br>Lord Gikzic shook his head, &quot;No, Shrikke.  I suggest you go to Velious.  Gain the favor of the giants or dwarves that live on that frozen continent.  There you can learn what you must to help deal with this danger.  If you survive, then come back to Cabilis.  We will be waiting for you, and so with they, I'm afraid.  He opened a chest and pulled out a long dark sword that was familiar to me.  &quot;Do you know this sword, Shadowknight?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Lord.  It is Squire Mharkas' Dark Reaver,&quot;  I replied.<br><br>&quot;No, broodling.  This is your Dark Reaver.  Now leave.  Before things become more complicated and dangerous.&quot;<br><br>I left the City of Cabilis, through Field of Bones only stopping at the Tower of Kurns to replenish my supply of bone chips.  As I headed  to Warsilks Woods, I stopped and looked upon my city.  I left my city as an outcast.  And someday, I would return to this city of my race, but not as an outcast.  Not as an orphan disowned by his people, but as an angel of death.  <br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Jan  4 12:18:45 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have read all of your posts to date and I have enjoyed them thoroughly. I would like to see more in the tale of Shrikke but, I am sure I would be most pleased with anything that you wrote. You see, I once played a Wood Elf rogue named Beofwulf on the Morrell-Thule server however, my father's computer was barely able to run it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Due to an eternity of LOADING... PLEASE WAIT, I decided I was not getting my $10.00 a month's worth. I would load so slowly that I would miss my stop on boats. I have a job now and have saved up $600.00 and am working on getting a Dell computer in the range of $850-1000. I think it is something I can handle and and something that can handle Everquest.<br>     I have missed playing very much and reading stories of Everquest, for me, has become the next best thing to actually playing the game. Many people post stories online and some, of course, are better than others but, few are as good as yours. IMHO Anyways, now that you have taken a trip on the gravy train, hopefully you will get something out of this. Thank you very much and keep up the good work scribe.<br><br><br><br>Beofwulf (at heart)<br>Rogue: 19th Coin<br>Morrell-Thule<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"Damnation is eternal.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A small apology.&nbsp;&nbsp;I expanded the story a little bit and have included the entire Part 15. instead of just the part I added.  <br><br>This is the last of Shrkke for a bit.  I am thinking of a story line for another of my characters, so look for that in the future.<br><br>Again, I can not thank enough those who have supported the story with their comments and encouragement.  And of course...if you have any suggestions, please don't be afraid to post.<br><br>Part 15.<br><br>I could tell many stories about my time in the Test.  Battles fought, hunger, cold, the constant struggle for dominance over our environment and over each other; all of these were part of the two years that I spent as a broodling in the wilds of Kunark.  Did I learn what the Test was meant to teach?  Yes, but it was not until many years later than I understood what I had learned and what the nature of the Test was truly.  The Test, above all things, teaches the lesson of balance.  When to use violence and when to compromise, when to seek your own glory and when to sacrifice for the group, when to fight and when to hide, all these lessons of balance, most races learn once they reach adulthood.  The Iksar learn them long before we ever step outside the influence of our own land, because in reality during the life of an Iksar, the Test never ends.<br><br>Before I opened my eyes, I knew that I had passed the Test.  How you ask?    The feeling of a warm clean blanket over my skin and the mattress under my body gave it away in an instant.  I had been keeping third watch, waiting for the sun to finally come over the mountains, when suddenly; I was back among my people.  I could smell the warm food being cooked by the slaves in the kitchen.  I could hear the footsteps of other Iksars walking the halls.  I waited a long time with my eyes closed, savoring the feeling of safety that I had not felt in the last two years.  I did eventually open my eyes.  I discovered I was in a small room with a fire pit set in the wall.  A small fire was burning giving me enough light to see.   Over a chair sat a tunic I assumed was for me to wear and on the table was a pitcher of water and a washbasin.  I cleaned myself, and then put on the tunic.  I was ready for whatever was next.  I went to open the door, when I noticed something the shadows had hidden from me, my backpack.  All the items that I had called my own during the Test, where there, placed neatly in my bag.  On top was my lightstone.  I had not even noticed it had been removed from my neck.  As I picked it up and held it for a moment, a flood of memories came rushing back to me.  I recalled the excitement of learning that both the belt and the robe that we had looted from the dead Hapzass both were magical in nature.  It was also the first time I had heard the word &#8220;twink&#8221;.  I remember the day when we buried broodmates, Tursbaj and Gluzligz.  Both were casualties of another clutch running through our camp while being chased by a goblin warrior.  I remembered when hunger forced us to raid and drive out another clutch so that food would again become plentiful in our part of the valley.  I remembered Larriz.  He was sleeping soundly when I had last seen him.  Had he been taken out of the valley at the same time I had been removed?  I hoped so.  I hoped to see him again in the near future.<br><br>I put the lightstone away and closed up the backpack.  It was in some ways like putting away my childhood.  I tied the top of the bag and placed it under my bed, only to be taken out and my adventures remembered when life needed a touch of balance. <br><br> I opened the door to the torch-lit corridor to find a Crusader standing guard.  He looked down at me and almost smiled.  &#8220;Are you finally are ready to start training in earnest, broodling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to learn.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Are you sure, broodling?  I would not want to hurry you into the next stage of life prepared for you by the Lord of Fear.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to start,&#8221; I stated with just a hint of confusion in my voice.<br><br>&#8220;Well broodling, it has been my experience that most would rather start their new paths on a good foot.  I believe that means that your tunic need to be turned around the correct way.&#8221;  I looked down, and sure enough in my hurry to get out the door; I had put my tunic on backwards.  I quickly slipped it around to face the proper direction.  &#8220;Excellent, broodling.  In another couple of years, you might be able to put on your own shoes.  Come with me.  You have a meeting with Arch Duke Zog.&#8221;  I followed the Crusader down the familiar corridors of the temple.  We walked through the teleport pad to the upper levels.   The Crusader pointed to a ladder attached to the back wall.  &#8220;Climb the ladder, broodling.  At the top, the Arch Duke is waiting for you.  You must hurry.  The Arch Duke does not like being kept waiting.&#8221;<br><br>I climbed the ladder as quickly as I could.  Upon reaching the top, I could see the Arch Duke waiting on a balcony looking over our city.   However, the simple task of getting off the ladder to where I could reach Arch Duke Zog was made suddenly difficult.  The floor of the room was built so that one had to make a difficult jump from the ladder in order to reach it.  I steeled my nerve and made an attempt at jumping for the landing and was rewarded being knocked unconscious by the floor in the room below me.  I repeated this activity for the next two hours, climbing the ladder and jumping to the landing, usually taking damage in the process.  Eventually, I succeeded.  As I pulled my bruised body to the balcony, I hailed the Arch Duke and bowed.  He turned and motioned me to come closer.  As I stepped closer to the Arch Duke Zog, he took me by the shoulder and pulled me next to him where I could look over the city of Cabilis by his side.<br><br>Without taking his eyes from the city he asked me, &#8220;How are you feel, broodling.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Respectfully, Arch Duke, I feel tired and bruised.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Why do you feel tired and bruised?&#8221;<br>&#8220;The climb to meet you was difficult, more difficult, than I thought, Arch Duke.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I know you could see me standing here, broodling.  Why did you not call for help?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Arch Duke.  It seemed important that I overcome the obstacle myself.  I believed that somehow the leap from the ladder to the room was a test of whether I was worthy of speaking to you.&#8221;<br><br>Arch Duke Zog nodded slightly.  Then pointing out into Cabilis, he continued, &#8220;Broodling, what do you see out there before you?&#8221;<br><br>I looked out into in the city where Crusaders and Troopers stood guard, where groups of Frogloks under the watchful of eye of the Toilmaster re-build fallen and decayed structures, where the Kloks bought and sold goods from under their tents.  &#8220;I see my home, Arch Duke.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I see my home as well, broodling.  But I also see a people under siege who are battered and bruised from the trials of the past. A once great empire that is now a shadow of it&#8217;s former self.&#8221;  He turned suddenly looked at me, &#8220;And still our enemies seek to destroy us.   Do you know why?&#8221;  I shook my head to indicate I did not.  &#8220;Because, broodling, they fear us.  They fear our dedication to our race and culture.  They fear what each of us is willing to sacrifice in the name of our cause.  The fear what can be accomplished when a people have a clear purpose without distraction.&#8221;  He turned and looked back at the city.  &#8220;Do you know why I had the floor built so far away from the ladder, Shrikke?&#8221; <br><br>I was surprised when he used my name.  &#8220;It is a test.  To see who is worthy to speak to you.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No, broodling.  It is a reminder to every Shadowknight of Greenmist that the road to the top is often filled with painful challenges and most often those challenges must be taken on by without aid.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;So, if I had asked for help getting off the ladder&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I would have killed you.  You would have not had the spark that a true Knight of the Greenmist needs in order to succeed.  Go now&#8230;learn, fight, and understand.  Become strong and intelligent.  And above all, know that the whole of Norrath is fearful because another Iksar Shadowknight will soon walk the earth.&#8221;<br><br>Part 16.<br><br>The path to becoming a Knight of the Greenmist is long.  Before I was sent out to serve my people, I had spent five years learning at the feet of the guild masters lessons in both blade and spell.  It was on my thirteenth hatching day that I received my Pawn&#8217;s khukri and sent out to the entrance of the city to help guard my people from the creatures that roam the wilds.  <br><br>Today, the Iksar are still re-building our empire and our city.  Today we still have enemies without and within that would happily destroy our race and our way of life.  However, today, they failed to destroy us.  And today, the Iksar grew stronger.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I did not have much time to add to the story this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are following the story, I am sorry.  I will try to add a little more sometime next week, but with Thanksgiving on the horizon, who can say :-)<br><br>On the issue of Thanksgiving...Everyone is aware of the issues that are going on in the United States.  I think that in the light of the events of Sept. 11th that we all feel a little closer to our families and each other.  I would suggest that you make known to your loved ones how you really feel about them during this season.  Tell them how thankful you are that they are a part of your life, because in the end you never know when you will never again get that chance. <br><br>Again and as always, please don't be afraid to give me comments and suggestions on this contining story.  Writing only gets better when you have critism.<br><br>Part 15.<br><br>I could tell many stories about my time in the Test.  Battles fought, hunger, cold, the constant struggle for dominance over our environment and over each other; all of these were part of the two years that I spent as a broodling in the wilds of Kunark.  Did I learn what the Test was meant to teach?  Yes, but it was not until many years later than I understood what I had learned and what the nature of the Test was truly.  The Test, above all things, teaches the lesson of balance.  When to use violence and when to compromise, when to seek your own glory and when to sacrifice for the group, when to fight and when to hide, all these lessons of balance, most races learn once they reach adulthood.  The Iksar learn them long before we ever step outside the influence of our own land, because in reality during the life of an Iksar, the Test never ends.<br><br>Before I opened my eyes, I knew that I had passed the Test.  How you ask?    The feeling of a warm clean blanket over my skin and the mattress under my body gave it away in an instant.  I had been keeping third watch, waiting for the sun to finally come over the mountains, when suddenly; I was back among my people.  I could smell the warm food being cooked by the slaves in the kitchen.  I could hear the footsteps of other Iksars walking the halls.  I waited a long time with my eyes closed, savoring the feeling of safety that I had not felt in the last two years.  I did eventually open my eyes.  I discovered I was in a small room with a fire pit set in the wall.  A small fire was burning giving me enough light to see.   Over a chair sat a tunic I assumed was for me to wear and on the table was a pitcher of water and a washbasin.  I cleaned myself, and then put on the tunic.  I was ready for whatever was next.  I went to open the door, when I noticed something the shadows had hidden from me, my backpack.  All the items that I had called my own during the Test, where there, placed neatly in my bag.  On top was my lightstone.  I had not even noticed it had been removed from my neck.  As I picked it up and held it for a moment, a flood of memories came rushing back to me.  I recalled the excitement of learning that both the belt and the robe that we had looted from the dead Hapzass both were magical in nature.  It was also the first time I had heard the word &#8220;twink&#8221;.  I remember when we buried broodmates, Tursbaj and Gluzligz, on the same day.

I would not want to hurry you into the next stage of life prepared for you by the Lord of Fear.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After a number of tales, I thought it was time for a bit of a rant.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was playing one of my favorite alternate characters, a dwarf paladin.  He has newly started his 20th season and is excited about getting rid of the damage cap and getting the Ghoulbane he welds to finally proc. <br><br>Well, without pause, I ran to the Estate of Unrest eager to make the undead of the zone completely dead once again.  Upon entering the zone I searched for a group and was invited to join a group of four in their high teens - another dwarf pally, a gnome enchanter, a druid, and a cleric.  Being the highest level character, I was asked to pull and was happy to do so.  With the Spirit of the Wolf running through my veins I started pulling the dark boned skeletons and ghouls that roam the lower level of the Estate.  I was exceptionally pleased to see the the message - "A ghoul has been hit for 137pts of non-melee damage"  I love that sword.<br><br>Anyway, after clearing the easier part of the first floor (round room and attached hall) and easily dealing the undead, I poked my little dwarf head around some of the rooms to inspect some areas in which I have less knowledge.  As you can imagine, I was soon shouting "Train to zone."  Four ghouls and a couple other skeletal types who's names I can not currently remember began chasing me out of the Estate.  I was not too concerned.  I still had SOW and the zone was fairly empty.  I could lead these creatures to zone without endangering the party at large.  I made my way out of the side door, again shouting "Train to zone."  Made my way to the point between the bush mazes to find that the creatures had stopped chasing me and were killing my party members.  They were a heroic group ...they thought I was about to be killed and came to save me.  I could not leave them to die.  So, with a LOH on the other Paladin who was almost dead and a couple of quick heals for the enchanter, I jumped into battle.  All the time, yelling for the others to run.<br><br>The outcome was not as bad as it could have been. Three of the five members made it to zone.  The enchanter and I did not survive the experience.<br><br>So as I ran back from Greater Fay, I was thinking a few things.  The first, have faith in the character that you have asked to pull...or ask someone else to pull.  Pulling creatures comes down to judgement and all good pullers know that their first job is to keep their group safe.  In the lower end game, that means when a pull goes bad that the puller leads the creatures to zone and avoids this group.  In the higher end game a bad pull basically means the puller stops in a good location for his/her corpse to be recovered.  If your puller does not know these rules, get someone else to pull.<br><br>Secondly, I thought that even though the group I was playing with could have used better judgement, that they had acted heroically and well within the spirit of roleplaying.  It was exciting fighting a battle with monsters everywhere, knowing that there was little doubt that this battle was going to end poorly.  I sometimes get tired of pulling for experience or camping for a specific item and find the real heart of the games comes from when you lay your life on the line in a seemingly hopeless battle.<br><br>I really like this game.  It allows me to talk to friends that I would normally not see regularly.  It gives me opportunity to meet new and unusual people.  It gives me a bit of an adrenalin boost that has not been as much a part of my life since my wife and I started having kids.  (My wife always thought I was nuts for wanting to ride my bike up a dirt trail, just to have the experience of riding back down at very high speeds around rocks and trees.)  <br><br>I complain as much as everyone about specific parts of this game, but where else can I get 25-30 hours of enjoyment for 10 bucks a month and stay in touch with old friends at the same time?<br><br>My final thought?  Have a good time out there. Real life has enough stress without adding stress to what is supposed to be the fun part of our lives.<br><br>Good hunting all!!!<br><br>From Parttime and his alter ego...<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Excellent Sir Parttime.&nbsp;&nbsp;I to play a dwarf paladin on the PVP server Tallon Zek.  What you said about the bad pull is correct.  I suspect that perhaps the players you were grouped with were not high enough level yet to recognize that you were trying to pull the train away from them.  Also, I have hunted Unrest many times, and can tell you that trains from inside have a mind of their own.  Sometimes when you you pull them outside they will run in the opposite direction around the estate to chase you to the zone.  This pathing can cause the train to become larger and more dangerous; or, it can cause it to attack the group you were so valiantly trying to defend.<br><br>What I am trying to say is that Unrest is a dangerous zone where stuff like this happens all the time.  Look at the good side.  You died after using your lay on hands and healing and brawling, allowing most of your party to escape alive.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I don't have time to proof this copy...sorry for the mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to get home or my wife will make it so I will need a rez. in real life.  Have a good weekend all.<br><br>Part 14.<br><br>Chasnic and Zzrantan both disappeared one night about a moon after the scale wolves attacked our camp.  Larriz and I did not see them go to say our farewells.   We assumed the Testmaster had determined they had passed the Test and where ready to start their lives serving the Emperor as the will of Cazic Thule dictated.  I was pleased to find Zzrantan&#8217;s mace, which I had originally found on the body of a dead shaman, leaning up against a tree where he had been standing watch.  It was a good weapon compared to the dagger that I wore on my hip.  I offered Larriz the dagger.  He declined the offer, saying that he would rather depend on the strength of his own hands, then the weakness of steal.  Monks, in my opinion, are an odd bunch.<br><br>We adjusted to the change as best we could, considering there were only two of us left in the clutch.  Battling creatures became, essentially, more of an exercise of avoidance than of confrontation.  The lack of fresh meat made both of us rely more heavily on our foraging skills than we had previously.  Also, the possibility of a raid from another clutch became a more likely event with only the two of us left.<br><br>Luck served Larriz and myself well in the avoidance of succumbing to such a raid and provided us the opportunity to join another clutch.  It was twenty days since Chasnic and Zzrantan had disappeared in the night.  Larriz and I were doing what we did every moment we were not guarding or sleeping.  We were trying to find food for the day.  In coming down the path to our camp with a bag full of roots that we had managed to dig up by the stream, Larriz poked me and pointed down at the trail.  In the dust could clearly see the foot and tail prints of a number of Iksar heading towards our camp.  Larriz and I quickly stepped off the trail and headed quietly towards our camp.  I must admit that Larriz was much better at traveling silently.  It seemed that every time I moved a leaf rustled or a twig snapped.  Larriz on the other hand moved so quietly that at times I would simply lose track of him.  Nevertheless, we arrived at a hill over looking our camp without being noticed and in time to see a group of five Iksars going through our camp.  They seemed upset, probably because no food could be found.  We could hear who seemed to be the leader of the clutch, a smallish Iksar wearing a robe and holding a staff, yelling and pointing at different locations around the camp directing each broodlings to search in places where food may be hidden.  They did not realize that all the food we had was in the bag sitting next to me.<br><br>It was a long time before they gave up their search.  After much discussion they decided that we must have some hidden stash of supplies somewhere and the best way to get those supplies was to capture us.  Larriz and I had decided that we had two choices.  The first, to simply disappear until they left and make due without the bedding and other supplies they would surely steal.  The other choice was to try to convince them to let us join their clutch.  The first option had little short-term risk, but would result in some serious long-term problems.  The second choice was dangerous at the moment, but if successful gave us the protection of a clutch once again.  There is a saying:  Better to fight the dragon you know is at the gate, then to ignore it and be surprised when he returns.  The dragon, in this case, was the leader of this clutch.  <br><br>We watched the other broodling hide themselves around our camp, trying to determine the best way to present ourselves to them.  We noted with some humor that the leader of the clutch had placed himself as far away from where battle was likely to start has he could.  Shaking our heads, Larriz and I sat on the hill above our camp eating the roots we had found discussing possible methods of dealing with this current problem.  In the course of that discussion, we came upon a plan.   And according to the plan, I needed to take hostage the largest broodling in the other clutch.  I did not say it was a good plan.<br><br>I crawled through the underbrush towards where the broodling that Larriz and I had come to the conclusion was most likely the main warrior of the group.  She had placed herself near the path entrance to our camp, I&#8217;m assuming to ambush us and cut off our line of escape once we that entered our camp.  I moved slowly from bush to tree with dagger in hand.  Did I mention that stealth was not one of my greatest strengths?  It took me quite a while to finally get in position where I could easily subdue the broodling when the forest itself betrayed me.  A light breeze ran through the forest just as I was about to place my dagger at the throat of the other broodling.  She turned to watch the leaves rustle and out of the corner of her eye, saw me coming up behind her.  I lunged at her hoping to knock her to the ground before he could get her weapon pointed at me.  I partially succeed.  I did knock her to the ground, but she drew a line of blood from my neck beneath my ear and along the line of jaw in whipping her short sword around.  Luckily, I pinned her arm to her body before she could reverse the blade.  We rolled together in the leaves of the forest, one of us trying to get an opening.  Cazic Thule was with me.  I ended up on top and managed to bring the hilt of the dagger down upon her skull, stunning her for a moment.  Unsure how long she would remain stunned I hit her again.  After the second strike, her body went limp.  I looked up to the forest around me.  I was in danger.  The scuffle had not gone unnoticed by the other broodlings who were quickly coming my direction.<br><br>&#8220;Stop!!  Everyone stop!!&#8221; I yelled.  &#8220;Or she dies.&#8221;  I could see the other broodlings stop with their weapons in hand.  I rolled the unconscious broodling closer to the path and into a more open area.  &#8220;I and another want to join your clutch,&#8221; I said to them.  &#8220;Who leads you?  I would talk to the leader.&#8221;<br><br>A voice came from the brush on the other side of the camp from where I held my hostage.  &#8220;I lead this clutch,&#8221; said the small Iksar in the robe as he stood on a rock to see over the top of the foliage what had transpired.  He made no movement toward where I held my prisoner.  &#8220;I say who belongs and who does not belong.  I am Hapzass.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Hapzass, I and my clutchmate would join your group.  The Testmaster has taken two of our clutch and then left us without others to help.  My clutchmate is wounded in the woods and I now hunt alone.&#8221;  Stopping for a breath, &#8220;I am quick and resourceful as this proves.  I would be able to pull my own weight and my clutchmate would be a great asset when he is mended.  What say you?  Quickly, please.  I do not want to battle this one again.  Do not force me to kill her.&#8221;  I pressed the dagger against the fallen broodlings throat.<br><br>&#8220;Kill her and save me the trouble.  She has failed and I will not tolerate failure in my clutch.  Or do you not have the stomach to kill, pup?&#8221;  Hapzass smiled at me.  &#8220;You are not in the position of strength you thought.  You did not think I was willing to sacrifice one of those within the clutch?  Unfortunate for you.&#8221;  He motioned at the other broodlings, &#8220;Kill them both.&#8221;<br><br>I looked at the broodling who had their weapons drawn.  They looked at me with my dagger against the throat of the fallen Iksar.  One of them turned to Hapzass and spoke, &#8220;He will kill her Hapzass.  We have room for one more.  You are being shortsighted.&#8221;  <br><br>&#8220;Are you questioning me, Gluzligz?&#8221;  Pulling his staff closer to him body.  &#8220;Do you think you can question my authority?  I am leader by right of power.&#8221;  The staff began to glow a little.<br><br>Gluzligz bowed his head and spread his hands.  &#8220;No, Hapzass.  I do not question your right to lead, only your decision in this instance.  We could take this one into the clutch easily.&#8221;<br><br>Hapzass snorted, &#8220;Foolish broodling.  We do not need another with my power&#8230;especially this one.  Shadowknights are pretenders of my art.  Kill them or I will do it myself.&#8221;  The staff he held began to glow brighter.<br><br>How did he know I was bound to the path of the Knights of Fear?  It was a question I did not know the answer to for a very long time.<br><br>Gluzligz turned back to me, &#8220;Please do not kill her.  She is my sister and a good warrior.  We can take you into our clutch.  I&#8217;m sorry we can&#8217;t take you both, but our food supply can only feed six.  You understand?&#8221;<br><br>I looked at Gluzligz and smiled.  &#8220;I understand, Gluzligz.  If your camp can only hold six then six it will be, broodling.&#8221;  I pressed the knife harder against the fallen female&#8217;s throat and Gluzligz&#8217; face went pale.<br><br>Hapzass screamed, &#8220;Shut up, Gluzligz!!  This is my clutch.  I hold the power here.  You will not&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>It was at that moment that Larriz stepped out of bushes behind Hapzass and calmly caved in his skull with my mace.  The leader crumpled to the ground without a sound.  Larriz struck again and yet again to make sure the broodling was dead.  At the sound of metal hitting flesh all three broodlings from the other clutch spun around and watched with open mouths as the life of the leader of their clutch came to an abrupt end.  Larriz stood up from finishing the task and waved at me with a big grin across his face.<br><br>The three broodling spun back towards me, weapons at the ready.  I smiled and stood up, removing my dagger from the throat of the fallen broodling.  &#8220;Gluzligz, you did say only six?  Correct?&#8221;<br><br>Gluzligz looked confused for a moment and then broke into a smile.  &#8220;Yes.  Yes I did.&#8221;<br><br>The other two broodling began to understand the nature of the event and everyone began to relax then Larriz broke the silence with a startled cry.  &#8220;Shrikke, the staff this piece of froglok dug was holding, I went to pick it up and it disappeared out of my hands.&#8221;<br><br>Gluzligz eyes went wide.  He spun around and yelled at Larriz, &#8220;Get everything off his body&#8230;quickly.&#8221;  <br><br>Larriz started looting the corpse as quickly as he could.  He had managed to get the belt and robe off of the dead broodling when suddenly blue lines of power exploded from the corpse with a blinding flash.  There was a bright flash of light and a quiet popping sound.  With that the corpse was gone.  Larriz walked out from behind the bushes rubbing his eyes with one hand and holding the robe and belt of Hapzass over the other.  &#8220;I got these,&#8221; indicating the robe and belt.  &#8220;But what in the name Cazic Thule&#8217;s claws what that?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It was a gate spell, broodlings.&#8221;  The Testmaster appeared as he walked out of the forest.  &#8220;Someone has gated the corpse of Hapzass out of the valley.  Someone has interfered with the outcome of the test.  Someone will soon be answering to me.&#8221;  He paced around where the corpse had fallen.  &#8220;They break with tradition and the will of the Emperor.  This must not be.&#8221;  He must have been talking to himself for as he spoke he never looked at any of us.  After a few moments more of muttering and swearing, the Testmaster stopped suddenly looked at all of us.  &#8220;Get back to your camp.  Shrikke. Larriz. Gather your belongings and go.  I have no need for you all getting in my way.&#8221;<br><br>We hurried and gathered our bedding and cooking supplies out of our shelter.  We stepped out ready to travel to our new camp in time to witness the Testmaster heal the fallen broodling.   She was confused, but held her tongue until we were out of earshot of the Testmaster.  She then made us stop our travels until we explained fully the events of the day.  Her name was Tursbaj.  After a complete explanation she looked me then Larriz over.  Then turned back to me.  &#8220;If you had said you where going to kill Hapzass, I wouldn&#8217;t have fought so hard.  Let&#8217;s go.  It&#8217;s getting late and we need to find dinner.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here is the lastest.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to send out a special thanks to Mugali and the Honorable tochail for the encouragement.  And although I doubt Verant will ever drop me a line to ask for creative assistance, I am honored that you appriciate my words and this story.<br><br>I hope you enjoy the next installment.  And again, don't be afraid to post your thoughts on how to improve the story :-)  Have a good week all.<br><br>Part 13.<br><br>The Iksar have few holidays.  And unlike most peoples, those holidays we do observe are not in remembrance of the Iksar when we were at our best.  We do not set apart days of celebration to pay tribute to a victorious battle or to the hatching day of a powerful leader or even to the memory of our god.  We chose instead to celebrate our defeats.  The day Emperor Rile&#8217;s fleet was destroyed is a holy day.  The day that our race was chased out of Chardok by our own creations is day that we come together to celebrate.  Why is this you ask?  The reason is simple.  Our past victories have taught our race nothing.  Only in times of defeat has our race become truly wiser.  Only when our weaknesses have been exposed and our deeds have been crushed along with our hopes upon ground have the Iksar grown as a race.  We celebrate these days of failure so that we will not forget our weakness and continue to dedicate ourselves to not repeating our mistakes.<br><br>Our small group survived the next couple of moons with few incidents.  Chasnic and Zzrantan taught Larriz and I how to forage food from our surrounding and to recognize the difference between the creatures we could conquer and those who would certainly end our lives.  They did not do this out of compassion, but out of a need for us to be members that would contribute to the continued welfare of the clutch and eventually whose judgment they could trust in a fight.  We tried not to disappoint them.<br><br>The clutch was not again tested again until one evening when Zzrantan was on watch.  I was awakened by the sharp sound of a stone coming through the open window and ricocheting against the back wall.  Instantly awake and knowing that Zzrantan had thrown the stone to alert us to some danger, I sat up in bed with the three other broodling listening for a hint of danger before running out to meet it.  As I sat on my sleeping mat, a sound could be heard, just on the edge of perception like the cry of a child.  Chasnic must have heard it as well because he quietly swore.<br><br>&#8220;Shrikke, you and Larriz, gather wood.  Now!  We don&#8217;t have much time before the pack gets here.  And try to be quiet.  Maybe they will pass by&#8230;maybe.&#8221;  Larriz and I scrambled out off of our mats and headed out of the hut.  Upon exiting, we saw that Zzrantan was already trying to get a fire started.   Chasnic on the other hand simply came out of the hut, stood in the middle of camp and sniffed the air and listened to the noise that had grown loud enough for me to understand the danger&#8230;scaled wolves.<br><br>Zzrantan spoke to us as he struck iron to flint, trying to get a spark to alight.  &#8220;It is not a mature pack that comes our way, but a litter that has just been chased out of its den, I think.  Fire will keep them at bay, if I can get it started before they reach our camp.&#8221;  Larriz and I hastily moved the wood that we had gathered for the morning to where Zzrantan was desperately trying to give life to a flame that would save our lives.<br><br>Chasnic sniffed the air a couple more times and pulled his weapon from its sheath.  &#8220;Hurry, Zzran.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I know&#8230;I know,&#8221; spoke Zzrantan as he struck the steel to the flint over and over again.  Moments pasted and the yips and barks from the pack could be heard clearly when finally one of the sparks started to produce smoke.  &#8220;Almost there&#8230;just a few more moments.&#8221;  From the smoke the hint of a flame could be seen moving it&#8217;s way through the pieces of bark and pine needles Zzrantan had used for kindling.   We all moved around Zzrantan and around the fire pit with our weapons drawn, facing out into the darkness again, waiting the beasts to show themselves.  I saw the first hint of a true flame glinting off the darting eyes of Chasnic who stood beside me when the first attack came.<br><br>The scaled wolf pup came out of the forest at a full run past me and towards the fire pit.  I turned to block the wolf and protect our small fire when a second beast, following closely behind the first, leapt out of the darkness, blindsided me and knocked me to the ground.  The first wolf avoided the small flame burning within our fire pit and headed back to the darkness of the forest, but not without Chasnic and Larriz landing a couple of glancing blows on the pup.  The second pup did not slow down after knocking me to my back, but continued over the top of my form and directly through the small fire. Scattering it and the rest of the fuel into small bits of glowing wood.  As I tried to get back to my feet, I heard a thud, a snap and a sharp yip as Zzrantan&#8217;s mace found the wolf&#8217;s passing form and broke it&#8217;s spine.   As I looked up and saw the struggling pup trying to get up, I knew that our group was just as damaged and paralyzed as the broken wolf without the fire that now lay in small, scattered flames about the fire pit.<br><br>I stood up with my small dagger in front of me.  At least twenty of the creatures now ringed our small camp.  Growling and short barks could be heard from all around.  &#8220;Chasnic, is it the light or the heat that the wolves fear?&#8221; I asked.<br><br>&#8220;The wolves are night hunters.  They do not like the light a fire shines,&#8221; he replied with a voice tight with fear.<br><br>I dropped my weapon and placed my hands to the crystal hanging around my throat.   I had not practiced with the stone around my neck since I had started the Test.  Would I be able to find the lines of force before the wolves charged in mass.  I heard Chasnic and Zzrantan yell at me, then the sound of the wolves rushing into the camp.  I found the force just as the first wolf landed on my chest, again knocking me to the ground.  As my head hit the dirt the light from the stone burst forth from the stone.  I passed out.<br><br>I know that I was unconscious for half a day.  I awoke with light streaming into our hut with my clutchmates standing around talking about what they would do if I did not wake up.<br><br>I sat up slowly, &#8220;We must have won?&#8221;  They turned to me as one with surprise in their eyes.<br><br>Chasnic almost smiled,  &#8220;We did, although you will have to tell us how, exactly. &#8220;<br><br>I told them about the stone my teacher had given me.  About how she had taught me how with concentration I could make the stone shine.  But, unfortunately, doing so took away all my energy.<br><br>Chasnic slapped me on the side of the head, no so gently.  &#8220;Well don&#8217;t do it again unless you tell us.  It&#8217;s a good thing the wolf pups left; because we were all mostly blind after your little show.  I&#8217;m still seeing spots.&#8221;<br><br>They let me rest for the day until my strength had returned a bit.  We ate well.  Scaled wolf is excellent, if you are hungry enough. <br><br>I sat third watch that night.  As I gazed into the blackness listening for the sound of goblins and lone scale wolves, the Testmaster suddenly appeared in front of me.  &#8220;I&#8217;m very surprised,&#8221; he started, &#8220;that your clutch is still alive.  How did your clutch kill the goblin, Shrikke?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;There was no goblin here, Testmaster.  Our clutch was attacked by a pack of scale wolves last evening.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Scale wolves?  But scale wolves do not use magic, young Shrikke.  If it was not a goblin, then who exactly used magic this last evening?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I did Testmaster.  I was given a&#8230;&#8221;  He stopped me with a wave of his hand.<br><br>&#8220;I do not want to know,&#8221; the Testmaster stated closing his eyes and shaking his head.  &#8220;The use of power is not forbidden in the Test, but it is a rare thing for reasons that you may not be aware of right now.  Have you studied with the Necromancers by any chance?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No, Testmaster.  Squire Mharkas has been teaching me to meditate since I was two seasons from hatching,&#8221; I said.<br><br>&#8220;Squire Mharkas is foolish, Shrikke.  She puts you and herself in danger, too much danger if you favor my opinion.&#8221;  Looking around the dark forest the Testmaster began to speak words of power and fade away.  &#8220;Good hunting, Shrikke.  I have other problems to deal with tonight.&#8221;  With that, he was gone.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To those reading this series of posts...my thanks for your encouragement.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have again put fingers to keyboard (since my boss has left early anyway) and have continued the humble beginnings of our friendly Iksar Shadowknight.<br><br>Please don't be afraid of making comments and suggestions or pointing out issues of lore that maybe be problematic.  Good weekend all.<br><br>Part. 12<br><br>Squire Mharkas did pack enough food for a meal.  I did not eat much of it, my stomach was jittery thinking about what the night could bring, but that did not stop the rest of my clutch from eating a hardy meal.  In between mouthfuls of food each told me a little of their history.  Chasnic was the oldest of broodlings.  His father was a warrior and his mother, a shaman of the Lord of Fear.  He figured that he had maybe two moons until the he had passed the test and returned home.  I asked him what path he would follow, his mother&#8217;s or his father&#8217;s.  He was not sure. <br><br>Zzrantan by his own statement was a warrior.  His mother was a warrior.  His father was a warrior.  His father&#8217;s line had been warriors from the time Emperor Rile had ruled the land.  I believed it.  He was big and strong, but not given to much creative thinking.  This is not saying that all warriors are not creative, but intellect is not necessarily the attribute that warriors tend to cultivate.  <br><br>If it was obvious that Zzrantan&#8217;s path was that of a warrior, it was more apparent that Larriz&#8217;s path was that of a monk.  Slightly smaller than even me, but with movements that where coordinated and flowing, it was apparent that the Court of Pain would have another lethal member of it&#8217;s society, if we survived the night.  Larriz had become a part of the clutch only a fortnight ago, but he had found his place in this group as scout and lookout.<br><br>What would be my role in this small group, I thought?  Only time would tell.<br><br>In the pack, as well as the food, were a couple complete changes of cloths, a blanket, a small shovel for camp hygiene, a pot and my burnout lightstone.  The Squire had attached the lightstone to a leather strap that could be hung around the neck.  I quickly tied the lightstone around my neck, and tucked the stone under my tunic remembering the Squire&#8217;s comment that the stone could be a blessing or a curse in my future.<br><br>The meal was quickly over.  I, along with everyone else, began gathering wood and rocks for the night to come.  My trips back and forth in search for weapons gave me an idea of my surroundings.  Our camp was placed in a slight bend in the stream.  The stream wasn&#8217;t large enough to provide any protection, but someone would have to move fairly quietly not to be noticed coming across it.  Preparations where complete for the evening just as the night became truly dark.  I was informed that usually everyone sits guard once per night, but because of the possible danger, everyone was going to spend the night awake.  Each broodling hidden themselves around the camp looking out into the darkness in a different direction.  I got to watch the stream, being that it was the easiest direction to cover.  So, with the dagger firmly in one hand and a pile of large stones next to me, I started my first night of the Test peering into the darkness of the forest awaiting the coming of chaos.<br><br>I waited a long time.  The nighttime sounds where unfamiliar, but none of the other broodlings seemed to be concerned.  As the night continued, I relaxed.  Maybe my clutch mates where wrong.  Maybe nothing would happen tonight.  I do not remember when I fell asleep, but I do remember hearing Zzrantan&#8217;s crying out the alarm.  I woke up with a start, my hand on my dagger and my heart beating wildly.  I spun in the direction of Zzrantan&#8217;s cry to see a skeletal shape walking into our camp.  The figure walked in a straight line, apparently unaware of the four of us.  Chasnic yelled out for everyone to hold their positions.  The skeleton walked to the fire pit in front of our tent and stopped as if it was warming the flesh it did not anymore possess.  Suddenly the creature turned and headed directly towards Larriz&#8217;s position.  How had it sensed Larriz?  I learned later, that the undead had an uncalculated amount of hatred for the living.  That hatred seems to bestow the undead with an uncanny sense.<br><br>The skeleton moved toward Larriz with speed and purpose and Larriz followed suit, running away from the spectral entity.  I could hear Larriz screaming for help as he wound his way through the trees.  Even with Larriz speed, the skeleton was quickly making up ground on the broodling.  Chasnic and Zzrantan both yelled instructions to the fleeing Larriz.  I heard enough of their instructions to know that they wanted Larriz to get back to camp.  I believe Larriz heard them as well, because moments later he came running into camp, the skeleton on his heels.  The skeleton was about to pummel the small broodling in the middle of camp, when a stone came flying out of the darkness, striking the skeleton on the side of the head.  The skeleton backhanded the running Larriz, sending him flying across the camp, then stopped and turn towards me.  I threw that rock?  Squire Mharkas would not be impressed with me.  It was foolish to have the taunted the creature, when I was the least prepared to deal with it.<br><br>As the skeleton turned towards me and started moving out of the camp in my direction, two forms converged on it.  Zzrantan with my mace in his hand swung an overhand blow that cracked the arm off the skeleton. Chasnic struck a blow to the creature&#8217;s leg that connected, but did not seem to do much damage.  The skeleton forgot about me completely and swung its one remaining arm around in a roundhouse that struck Zzrantan solidly in his ribs.  The broodling sagged under the blow, but did not fall, and again swung his mace.   The mace struck the skeleton again, this time collapsing the ribcage.  And again Chasnic swung his dagger.  This time the leg snapped and the rest of the creature fell to the ground in a heap.   Zzrantan struck the skeleton a couple more time for good measure as Chasnic headed over the still form of Larriz.  Chasnic rolled the Larriz onto his back and shook the fallen broodling.  I heard Larriz moan and Chasnic helped the wounded Larriz onto his feet.  Chasnic then started to explain a couple of tactical concepts to the young Iksar.  The most important of which is that running around in circles makes it impossible for your clutchmates to help you and in the future, if a creature was attacking, that the appropriate course of action was to either stand and fight, or run to where your clutch can help you, then stand still and fight. <br><br>We all went back to our positions, peering into the blackness of the forest. And I did not have any problems staying awake.  Two other skeletons walked past our camp, but not close enough to sense our little group.  All was quiet, when I heard the shouting.  Someone or something was heading our direction.  As it got closer, I could hear it crashing through the undergrowth, yelling at the top of its lungs.  I picked up a rock in one hand, not sure of what was about to happen.  As the creature got closer, I could tell that it was shouting for help in Iksar.  Chasnic heard the shouting as well and told everyone to hold positions.  Out of the brush and splashing through the stream came another broodling.  He had blood flowing over his face from a slash over his eye.  His clothes where ripped and slashed, either from a battle or from his flight through the woods.  I watched as he entered our camp and fell to his knees in exhaustion.  He shouted that he needed help, that a skeleton had destroyed his whole clutch and was chasing him.  Chasnic stepped into the center of the camp and walked over to the young Iksar.  Chasnic asked the broodling to which clutch he had belonged.  The broodling told him, but added that everyone was dead.  Chasnic asked the broodling to describe the skeleton, quickly.  The broodling gave a description of a skeleton well over three arm spans tall, with bones covered in scales.  Chasnic nodded his head and placed his hand on the broodling&#8217;s shoulder.   The broodling looked up with some hope, thinking that he had been saved.  He never saw Chasnic&#8217;s dagger as it entered his chest and punched his heart.  The gleam faded away from the broodlings eyes and Chasnic laid the young Iksar on the ground.<br><br>He told everyone to stay alert, especially for a large skeleton coming towards camp.  And he added that if we heard him yell to run, that we where to run without looking back.  He then left and returned to his own hiding place to again watch the night.<br><br>Eventually, the morning did come and Chasnic told everyone to come out from hiding.  We all looked the worse for wear.  Zzrantan was still favoring his one side a lttle where the skeleton had struck him and the bruise above Larriz eye was nto quite completely healed.  Chasnic and I had not taken any real damage, but where very tired.   Zzrantan moved the corpse of the dead broodling to the edge of the camp and we all sat down around the fire.<br><br>It was a hard night and no one was talkative, but I had to ask the question, &#8220;Why did you kill him, Chasnic?  I thought we where short a member?  Was it just because he was from another clutch?  I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;<br><br>Chasnic looked at me and almost smiled, &#8220;No, I did not kill him because he was from another clutch.  I would not kill another broodling simply because of where he lived in the valley.&#8221;  He sighed.  &#8220;His clutch had attacked or been attacked by what sounded like a scalebone skeleton.  The creature was too powerful for his clutch to defeat and was definitely too strong for our group to deal with adequately.   That skeleton, if it were following him, would have walked right into our camp and destroyed him and us.  I merely hasten the death that was already assured and lessened the possibility of our own.  We barely survived the decayed skeleton&#8217;s attack.  Anything more powerful and we would have joined the undead in their next walk through the valley.&#8221;<br><br>I nodded in acceptance.  &#8220;Chasnic, I have one other question.  Do you know the location of this broodling&#8217;s clutch?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes.  It is not too far from here,&#8221; stated Chasnic.<br><br>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m guessing that we need to loot what we can off this one and head over to the other camp and see if the skeleton has provided us with some extra supplies before any other clutch relies what has happened.  Correct?&#8221;<br><br>Zzrantan laughed.  &#8220;Exactly.  Welcome to the Test, Shrikke.&#8221;<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry I have not posted in a while.  RL and work gets busy and sucks up my EQ time.<br><br>The next installment of Shrikke's Bio.  I need to wrap this up I think or it will become a book unto itself :-)<br><br>Thanks again for praise and encouragement.  Please feel free to comment or suggest.<br><br>Part 10.<br><br>Life without purpose is worthless.  Find a being without purpose and you have found nothing.  Find a purpose without a being and you have found opportunity.  Truly, all other races on Norrath hate the Iksar.  Even the Dark Elves who celebrate death, torture and bloodshed will generally not deal with those of my kind.  There is a reason for this.  The Iksar can be expected to do exactly what will suit the purpose of continued existence for our race without hesitation, emotion or thought of sacrifice.  If that means the death of an innocent or a thousand innocents or entire race, that is acceptable as long as the Iksar advance in power.  However, we do not enjoy such practices in and of themselves.  We do not glorify in the death of another.  Death is a tool.  Fear is a tool.  We use tools to build our future; we do not let the tools dictate that future. <br><br>I do not remember coming to the wilderness from my home with Squire Mharkas.  I do not remember how I got a large bump on my head.  I was told once that often trauma to the head can cause the loss of memory.  I do remember beginning to regain consciousness and my head throbbing when a great river of power flashed through my body.  I was instantly awake and alert.  My eyes opened to an adult Iksar who I had never seen standing over the top of me wearing a blue robe with a mace hanging on his belt.  He said nothing to me, but stood up, turned and walked into the dark forest.  He then began to speak quietly to another I had not seen, standing under the darkness of a tree.   I could not make out their words, so I started looking around trying to judge exactly where I was and what exactly was going to happen.  It was dark just before dawn.  The world around me was a mixture of trees and ebon hues.  The Iksar in blue robes nodded his head and began to walk away into the forest.  He had not taken twenty steps when there was thrum of a longbow from the direction of silhouette behind the tree.  I turned, to see an arrow lodged at the base of the skull of the blue robed Iksar.  He slumped face first onto the forest floor with hardly a sound.  I reacted by backing quickly into the shrubbery behind me hoping that I was not the next target.<br><br>The shadow behind the tree stepped out into the clearing as he concentrated on unstringing his bow.  It was an old Iksar, slightly bent with age.  He finished with his bow and looked around the clearing until his gaze fell upon the shrub where I was desperately trying to become one with the fauna.  &#8220;Come out broodling.  Your death will not come by my hand today.&#8221;<br><br>I slowly made my way out of the bushes, my gaze never leaving the old lizard.  &#8220;Why did you have to kill that one?&#8221; indicating the dead Iksar.<br><br>&#8220;It is the rules.  No one may know where the Test is conducted, except for myself and the leaders of each of the major guilds.  Any who happen upon this place by accident must be killed.  And any who are sent here on purpose are meant to be tested.  That one failed.&#8221;  The old Iksar pointed toward the bundle prepared for me by Squire Mharkas.  &#8220;Take your pack.  And keep up, the camp is a short ways away.&#8221;<br><br>I grabbed my bag and turned to see the old one already making progress through the dark undergrowth.  I would have to hurry to catch up, not having any idea where this place was located, or how to find my way back to my home if I got lost but I needed something from the dead Iksar.  I sprinted over to the body and grabbed the mace that still hung from the Iksars&#8217; belt.  I could not see it going to waste here in the forest.  With the mace in one hand and my bundle over my shoulder I ran to catch the old one.  For a moment I thought he had lost me.  In time, I spotted him ahead and managed to keep him in sight until I finally caught up with him.  He did not say anything about the mace although I am sure he knew from where I had gotten it.  He moved easily for an ancient one.  Age did not seem to hinder his movements through the woods as I nearly ran to keep up with him.<br><br>The rays of the sun where just beginning to stream over the tops of the mountains, giving the forest a tint of purple, when the old Iksar held his arm straight out to the side as an indication for me to stop.  My question was halted with a motion.  &#8220;Move behind that tree and do not move until I come for you, broodling,&#8221; he whispered.  I quickly made my way behind the tree and looked back the way I had came in time to see the old one with a motion of power gather the shadows of the forest around him and disappear.  He was a Knight of Shadow, like Squire Mharkas.<br><br>I waited quietly behind the tree, holding my newfound mace tightly with both hands, listening to the sounds of the early morning forest.  Each sound I heard making me suspect a hidden threat.   I spent until the sun was clearly above the mountains jumping each time a bird would take wing or rabbit would run for cover.  Eventually, as the morning passed and the old Iksar did not return, I grew tired of jumping and started enjoying the forest scene around me.  With my back to the tree and the warm morning sun shining warmly on my green scales, I started to dose.<br><br>I awoke with a start with a knife pressed up against my throat.  Three Iksars about my own age or a little older stood in front of me, while a fourth held the knife firmly under my chin.   The one holding the knife spoke, &#8220;What clutch are you with, broodling.&#8221;  I hesitated to answer.  I did now know what he was talking about.  Seeing my hesitation, the largest of the three in front of me pulled a dagger from her belt.  &#8220;We do not have time for dealing with this problem.  Sorry broodling, the Test is over for you.&#8221;  And with that, she lunged forward, trying to sink the knife into my belly for a quick kill.  I moved.  Luckily the one holding the knife to my throat seemed just as surprised at the abrupt attack as I and also jumped away.  Luckily, he managed to miss cutting my throat as I twist around the tree and away from the incoming knife.   Instead of the knife burying itself in my stomach, I felt the blade force itself through my scales and into my flesh along my ribs.  I would have made it behind the tree and hopefully into a full run if not for something getting caught between my feet.  Instead, as I dove around the tree and out of the way, I tripped and fell headlong into ball of arms, legs, and tail.  Cursing and thinking that death was just a few steps behind me, I reached down to remove the object that, even as I tumbled, was hampering my escapes.   My hand fell upon my looted mace.  Hearing the others coming towards me, I grabbed the mace with both hands, got me feet under me, and as I heard one of them coming up behind me, I stood up swinging the mace in a full circle.  I had never killed another being before.  I had seen many slaves and prisoner killed, but had never killed anyone myself.  The mace came into contact with the skull of the closest pursuer.  There was a sound of metal hitting bone and the young Iksar fell to the ground in a mass of blood and scale.  The weight of the mace spun me around even after the blow.   I tried to quickly bring the mace back to face my enemies.  When I did, they stood two arm lengths away from me, holding their own weapons, but they where not looking at me, but behind me.  I cautiously looked over my shoulder to see the old Iksar standing off to the side and behind me.<br>	&#8220;A poor showing, broodlings,&#8221; talking to the three young Iksars.  &#8220;This one should be dead if you had worked together.  However, may I be so bold as to suggest that you consider attacking an enemy instead of the newest member of your clutch?&#8221;  The others dropped the tips of their weapons and started looking at the ground in shame or frustration.  &#8220;Now you are again short two members.  It will be a difficult year, I think.&#8221;  The other three broodlings looked at me, then at the body of their fallen companion.  The old one continued, &#8220;The broodling doesn&#8217;t have a name yet, but considering what just occurred, I think we shall call him Shrikke.&#8221;<br><br>Part 11.<br><br>The Test of Sufficiency is a period between a broodling&#8217;s sixth and eighth season when a broodling is taken out to the wilds of Kunark, placed with a clutch of other young Iksars and left to endure.  Food, water, shelter and safety are in questionable supply during those years.   Young Iksars must learn to not only forage from the forest all they need to survive during the two years, but also be prepared to protect themselves and their clutch from the wandering creatures of the area and the intrusion of other clutches.   <br><br>The Test, from what I could discern, is held in a very large, round valley with only one pass.  The Testmaster, the ancient Iksar who introduced me to my clutch, guards the pass.  His responsibility was to regulate the types and numbers of creatures that entered the valley and to place candidates into clutches when they began the Test.   His greatest challenge seemed to be keeping balance within the valley.  Balance between the creatures of the area and the various clutches camped around the valley.   Too many creatures or creatures possessing too much power would simply overrun the clutches, too few creatures would limit the opportunity for each clutch to work together and be tested effectively.   In all things of the valley, the Testmaster was ultimately responsible.<br><br>How the Test came into existence is unknown to me. I would guess that the guild leaders may have some of the lore concerning the Test, but I have not asked and I doubt they would freely give such information.<br><br>And so, I found myself with three other Iksar broodlings wondering the wilds of Kunark.  It seems that I had &#8220;accidentally&#8221; killed the oldest and strongest of the broodlings and at the same time interrupted a raid that the clutch had planned upon another nearby group.  The broodling I had killed was named Ysshis.  She had wished to become a trooper and train at the Guild of Warriors after the Test.  Instead, the group looted her body, gave me the clothing, and buried it with their own claws so that it would not attract unwanted creatures.  Goblin whelps, I was told, are attracted to the bodies of the dead.   I had never seen a goblin.   I had a feeling that would change in the near future.<br><br>The Testmaster waited until the body was buried to depart. &#8220;I take my leave of you broodlings.  Chasnic&#8230;&#8221; the oldest remaining Iksar in the clutch &#8230;&#8221;inform Shrikke of the rule of the Test, as well as the penalty for breaking the rule. &#8220;  The Testmaster looked at the sun through the trees, then back at us.  &#8220;It is getting late in the afternoon.  I would head back to camp and set defenses for the night, if I where you.  Of course, I am not you.&#8221;  With that he turned and wandered into the forest, moving quickly through the growing shadows.<br><br>Chasnic turned to the three of us as the Testmaster disappeared from sight.  &#8220;I am Chasnic, this is Zzrantan, and he,&#8221; pointing at a small broodling burrowing under a fallen log, &#8220;is Larriz.  There is one rule to the Test.  Don&#8217;t leave the valley or you will be killed.  You may leave the Clutch, you may make your own camp anywhere in the valley, you may do whatever you want, but it you try to leave the valley, death will find you. Any questions?  No? Good then.  We need to get out of here.  Zzrantan, you don&#8217;t think that the Testmaster was giving us a hint of something that could happen tonight?&#8221;<br><br>Zzrantan was a big broodling, nearly a full head taller than myself.  In the sheath at his side he wore the looted dagger that had opened up the gash along my ribs.  The wound was basically healed, but the memory had not faded.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;probably.&#8221;  Zzrantan looked around the forest with a bit of anxiety   &#8220;Goblin crap.  We need to get back to camp if the dead are walking tonight.&#8221;<br><br>Chasnic turned back to me.  &#8220;Get your stuff and give that mace to Zzrantan.  He will make better use of it than you if the dead come to visit tonight.&#8221;<br><br>I hesitated a moment before handing the mace to Zzrantan.  Zzrantan reached out his hand and spoke.  &#8220;I could take it after the dead have made you one of their own?&#8221; <br><br>Understanding the threat, but unwilling to give up my mace.  &#8220;In trade for your extra dagger and sheath.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;  Zzrantan untied the dagger and sheath from his waist and tossed them to the ground at my feet, &#8220;Although you will have to clean the dagger.  It has some blood on it, I think.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I think that you will not find my weapon to be any cleaner.&#8221;  I handed the mace to the larger broodling and picked the dagger and my pack off the ground.<br><br>Chasnic turned to the small broodling digging under the fallen log, &#8220;Larriz, have you found anything to eat?&#8221;<br><br>A dirt covered head popped up over the log.  &#8220;Yep, but only a few grubs and earthworms.  I hope that Shrikke&#8217;s parents where good enough to pack him a meal he can share with the rest of us.&#8221;<br><br>I hadn&#8217;t looked in the pack.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; shrugging my shoulders.<br><br>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;  Chasnic said.   &#8220;Either you have some and will share with the rest of us or not.  We don&#8217;t have time to look for anymore.   Larriz grab what is there and let&#8217;s go.  I would rather be waiting for the dead, if they come, then be chased by them.&#8221;<br><br>The discussion was over.  As I ran through the woods behind Zzrantan I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder sort of night this would become.  These broodlings believed that the dead would walk the forest tonight.  I wondered about the dead Iksar in the blue robe.  Would he come back to claim his mace.  I almost laughed when I decide that it was not my worry anymore, the mace was in someone else&#8217;s hands.<br><br>We stopped by a small clearing next to a stream.  A small hut of logs and branches sat against a large boulder with a small fire pit in front.  &#8220;That is our home.  And for the next two years it is your home, Shrikke.  That is if the dead don&#8217;t kill us all tonight.&#8221;  I was hoping for some type of sarcasm to follow the statement, some indication that things where not as bad as I thought they were going to be.  Unfortunately, it did not come.  &#8220;Listen to me and Zzrantan.  Do what we ask, quickly.  And watch everyone&#8217;s back.  Now the first order of business if for us to gather some wood for the fire and find some fist sized rocks.  But first, Shrikke&#8230;see what you have in the pack.  I don&#8217;t feel like eating earthworms tonight.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think the Honorable Naldiin did an excellent job condensing Iksar history.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few holes that need to be filled in current events that I have questions about and can only speculate.<br><br>1.) How did the Iksar's become followers of Cazic Thule when it was certainly Innoruk(sp?) that gave them freedom with the coming of the Greenmist.  I'm assuming the makers of the Iksar where followers of the Lord of Fear and therefore the Iksar disposition is more apt to follow his leading.<br><br>2.) The troopers of Cabilis talk of the Emperor, but none have seen him or of this councel of five that is spoken of in the ancient texts.  The Necromancers seem to be the real power in Cabilis at the moment.  How did that happen?<br><br>3.) The test of betrayal within the SK guild for the Crusader's Khruki follows the events of an SK traitor who wishes to give ancient and holy texts to an agent of Mistmore.  The plan is stopped, but such dealings with Mistmore is a concern in the future considering the Necro's would be most likely to align with the ancient Vampire.<br><br>4.)  I am wondering if Innoruke(sp?...again)in the coming war will again claim the Iksar as his own and whether the Necro's will back him in his conquest of our race.  I do not think the SK guild would support this - Even though we use Necro spells, we are more aligned with the Shamans of our culture.<br><br>Okay...these are just wonderings on my part.  I do not know what the coming war will mean to my people, the Iksar, but I know it will be interesting to find out.<br><br>I'm sorry that I was not able to respond earlier, friend Tochail.

Regardless of what Pusbag may think (trolls being a bit dillusional and all), we of the BroodofKotiz are masters of death, plague, and disease.  We are further masters of the undead, and have fashioned spells to aid us in their control.  Our monks are the best in all of Norrath simply because Cazic felt it necessary to give us the ability to regenerate our health quickly.  Our warriors, while not able to wear those plates of metal favored by other races, are quite dextrous and strong, and their cunning more than makes up for their discomfort with the plate armor.  And, even though I dislike the shadowknights and shaman of our race, they have powers and are powerful in their own right.  My point, softskin, is that while I believe we would side with Mistmoor in any upcoming conflicts with the dragons, it is not out of fear that we do so.  We are strong enough to withstand Mistmoor, and strong enough to withstand another assault by the cursed dragonkind...  but we think it prudent to ally ourselves with one who has directed efforts against dragonkind in our past... perhaps the old addage of the enemy of my enemy is my friend would apply here.<br><br>Usula, Iksar Necromancer<br>Queen of Fear<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The next post about our growing Iksar.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope you enjoy.  Thanks again for the praise and please feel free to make suggestions.  Good hunting to all who travel Norrath.<br><br>Part 8.<br><br>No one had to tell me that something was going to happen on the day that I reached my sixth season.  As each of the group I played with reached their sixth season, they simply disappeared.  I was concerned, but not fearful.  What is the worst that could happen?  My suspicions where confirmed when Squire Mharkas unexpectedly walked into my room the night before my sixth hatching day and placed a bundle on my bed.<br><br>&#8220;You will need this tomorrow, hatchling.&#8221;<br><br>"Thank you, Squire.&#8221;  Looking into the eyes of my teacher, &#8220;May I ask why?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Tomorrow you start another stage of development.&#8220;<br><br>"I thank you for the lessons I have learned, Squire.&#8221;  I reached under my bed to a box that contained the lightstone.  I opened the box, thinking that I would return the lightstone to Squire Mharkas.  The lightstone was not in the box.  I looked up at the Squire in confusion.<br><br>Squire Mharkas shrugged her shoulders.  &#8220;I have placed the lightstone in your pack.  I would suggest you keep it hidden or it will be taken from you.  There will come a time when it will be useful to you, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Again, thank you, Squire.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It is nothing, hatchling.  In fact, it might well become a curse rather than a blessing.&#8221;  Squire Mharkas stepped closer to me.   &#8220; I will remind you now, as I have said before, do not let anyone know that you have practiced magic up to this point.  The ones that will take over your training do not understand magic or it&#8217;s use and will punish you for even a hint of its power. &#8220;   Squire Mharkas turned to leave my room and stopped at the door.  Without turning around she gave me a final piece of wisdom.  &#8220;Remember hatchling, power is drawn to purpose.  Find your purpose and power will come to you.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I will remember, Squire.&#8221;  I looked at the pack on my bed then back at the Squire.  &#8220;Squire, I have one more question, if you please.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, hatchling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;What is your purpose and am I part of the power that has been drawn to you?&#8221;<br><br>The Squire almost smiled.  &#8220;When you figure out the first part of that question, you will know the answer to the second, hatchling.  Sleep now.  You will need it.&#8221;<br><br>Part 9.<br><br>Squire Mharkas sat in front of the fire holding a cup of warm mead with a blanket over her legs and tail, thinking about what the future could bring.  The Test of Sufficiency was a foolish tradition in the option of the Squire. A full third of the hatchlings would not survive the test.  &#8220;What a waste of potential,&#8221; she thought.  But traditions must be followed.  Every hatchling must past the Test in order to be admitted to one of the major guilds.  A parent, or caretaker in this case, could choose to have a hatchling skip the test, but the hatchling would then be delegated to a life of menial labor and have no real chance of success.  Even Kloks had to participate in the Test.  The Test was the only way to start climbing the rungs of power that lead to glory.  &#8220;He will succeed&#8230;He must.&#8221;<br><br>In the glow of the fire, feeling the warmth of the bright flames, Squire Mharkas heard the steps of an individual coming towards her front door.  The individual stopped and without knocking opened the door to the squire&#8217;s home.  Wordlessly, the intruder made his way through the house to the hatchling&#8217;s room, quietly opened the hatchling&#8217;s door and moved inside.  There was a cry of surprise from the hatchling, a hollow thud from a bunt object, and a sound of a small body hitting the floor.  This was the tradition, that each candidate would be &#8220;abducted&#8221; from his or her home by a member of the sponsoring guild.  To be taken out to the wilds of Kunark to be tested and the participant&#8217;s worthiness determined by skill, strength and luck.  Luck was always the unknown.<br><br>The Crusader walked into the where the Squire sat with a large bag thrown over his shoulder.  &#8220;This hatchling was not asleep.  Did you not give him the sleeping powder in his evening meal?&#8221;<br><br>Squire Mharkas staring into the fire did not look up at the Crusader.  &#8220;Of course I did, Crusader.  But I did not watch him eat his meal.  Maybe he was not hungry tonight?&#8220;<br><br>&#8220;Maybe you are foolish squire with little to occupy your thoughts except your own housework?&#8221;  the Crusader spat back.<br><br>Squire Mharkas did not move.  The Crusader was much more powerful than her.  A direct confrontation would be pointless.  However, confrontation can come in many forms and is usually is best when not direct.  Mharkas lifted her head from her warm mead to look directly into the eyes of Crusader Cotat.  &#8220;He is my charge until you leave this house, Crusader.  I hope you have not damaged him without my permission?&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Cotat shifted the weight of the bag hanging over his shoulder.  &#8220;The hatchling is not permanently injured, I assure you, Squire.  It was your responsibility to see to it that the transfer was done without incident.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You are wrong, Crusader Cotat.  It was my job to place the powder in the hatchling food.  It is your responsibility to take the hatchling to the place of testing.  I believe that one of the requirements is that the hatchling must be at full health when he arrives at the testing location.  You have attacked a hatchling under my care without my permission, damaged him before the Test of Sufficiency and then hiss at me how I have not fulfilled my responsibilities?  For the attack alone, Crusader Gikzic could have you stationed in the swamp watching the frogloks for a number of seasons."  Looking back down into her mead, "I will file a complaint tomorrow.&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Cotat eyes glinted in the firelight, &#8220;I had to subdue the hatchling.  He attacked me.  I had to defend myself.  Crusader Gikzic will understand that.&#8221;<br><br>Squire Mharkas slowly shook her head with a look of disappointment on her face. &#8220;True, but I&#8217;m sure your fellow Crusaders would be interested to know how you felt threatened to the point of bearing by an unarmed hatchling. That would make for interesting conversation in the barracks, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Cotat knew he was beaten for the moment.  &#8220;My apologies, Squire.  I have misspoken myself tonight.  I will take the hatchling to the testing ground, with your permission.  I am sorry if I have offended you.&#8221;  The apology was spoken by one who knew he had no choice to bend, but would not forget.<br><br>&#8220;You may leave Crusader.  I will talk to the Testmaster in the morning to make sure that the hatchling does not accidentally receive any more damage between here and the field.  I would hate to think that you would so careless in the transport of the hatchling as you where in his abduction.  But what am I to think?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You may think what you wish, Squire.&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Cotat spun on his heals and left the home, quietly closing the door behind him.  Squire Mharkas went back to watching the fire and drinking her mead.  She would have part of a season until she received her next hatchling&#8230;what to do with the time.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Another longish post and again please don't be afraid of commenting on the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm always up for new ideas.<br><br>Part 6.<br><br>It was six cycles of the moon before I actually got the lightstone to shine.  As I meditated with Squire Mharkas night after night, I had begun to actually feel the forces around me.  Those forces came from everywhere: from Squire Mharkas, from the stone beneath, from the air, even from my own body.  I could, while concentrating, feel the weak forces emanating from the burnout lightstone in my hand.  All I needed to do was connect the force around me to those coming from the stone.  This night I actually managed to grab a line of power from the object closest to the lightstone, my own hand, and feed it into the lightstone.  There was bright flash that I saw through my eyelids, then blackness.<br><br>I woke up sometime later; feeling as if I had been ran over by a rhino.  Unable to move any of my limbs, I tried to open my eyes and was greeted by the sight of Squire Mharkas standing over me with a disapproving look on her face.<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I should praise you or punish you.&#8221; Shaking her head.  She turned around and left the room leaving me to fade back into sleep.<br><br>I slept for what seemed like a long while.  After a time, I was able to stand up and walk out of my room.  The kitchen was vacant of movement.  It was early morning, before the slaves started breakfast.  I walked through our home without any real intent except to stretch my limbs.  I still felt weak, but I knew I would live.<br><br>I jumped as a voice called to me, &#8220;Hatchling, come here.&#8221;  I walked into Squire Mharkas&#8217; room.<br><br>The Squire was lounging on her sleep mat when I entered, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I awoke you, Squire.  I will try to be quieter.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You did not wake me up.  I have been awake for quiet a while.&#8221;  Looking me up and down. &#8220;How do you feel, Hatchling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Weak, Squire, and tired, but I feel stronger as well.  Does that make any sense?&#8221;<br><br>Squire Mharkas almost smiled.  &#8220;Yes.  It makes sense.  You touched power.  That is apt to make you feel stronger.   However, you made a mistake.  Do you know what mistake?&#8221;<br><br>I knew that I had done something wrong.  Squire Mharkas used magic and the forces around her everyday without ending up in bed.  I thought about how I had connected the lines of force.  There was no mistake in connecting the forces together or the lightstone would not have glowed.  Maybe I needed to control that connection better.  That was it.  I had connected the lines of force, but had not controlled that connection, draining me of my force.  I explained my thoughts to the Squire, sure that I had come to the correct conclusion.  I was rewarded with a tail slap to the side of the head that made the room spin.  As I tried to recover, another blow hit me, knocking me against a wall.  I was still weak enough that I could not focus on the series of attacks that crashed against my body.  I was dipping in unconsciousness when the beating stopped.  Squire Mharkas picked me up by my tail yelled for a slave.  She handed me off to the slave with some instructions I could not understand in my state of disrepair.<br> <br>Soon I was being carried through the streets of Cabalis thrown over the shoulders of froglok.  We stopped and I was unceremoniously dropped on the ground.  The world rocked for a while as I tried to get my eyes to focus.  I did eventually get control of the swaying in my head, and managed to prop myself up on one elbow.  I looked up to see an army of frogloks scrambling up and down busily working on the latest construction project.  I turned my head the other direction to see the calves of a Taskmaster, standing next to me.  I stood up.  The Taskmaster did not even look at me.  I then turned and bowed.  &#8220;Honored Taskmaster. I believe I am at your service.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, you are.  I have been instructed to teach you a very important lesson, hatchling, about the use of power.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;What lesson is that, if I may ask, Taskmaster?&#8221;<br>His whip snapped before I even saw the moment.  My eyes watered at the strap caught me across the small of the back.  <br><br>&#8220;No. You may not. From this moment you are a slave and until someone tells me different you will continue to be a slave.&#8221;  The whip cracked again, this time across the back of my leg.  &#8220;Get to work slave.&#8221;  I paused to ask a question, but stopped as I looked into the face of the Taskmaster.  &#8220;Slave, I would hate to have to have to kill you for not moving fast enough.&#8221;  My question stuck in my throat.  &#8220;Good. Help that group carry those stones to the builders.  I would suggest moving quickly.&#8221;<br><br>I lived as a slave for the next cycle of the moon. And except for sleeping in a pen by myself, I was treated no different that any of the other slaves. The Taskmaster&#8217;s whip was always ready to help speed up my lagging movements.  Twice I was given beating so serious that I thought I was going to die as a slave.   I remember, over the course of the next month, I learned some of the language of the froglok and thankfully, how to eat without actually tasting the food.  However, I did not have any great insights about the lesson I was being taught.  Until one day&#8230;<br><br>I was doing what I did most days, moving rocks, when a shout came from one the other side of the worksite.   One of the slaves, a very large human with blue tattoos over most of his body, suddenly charged a guard.  The human, catching the guard by surprise, wrapped the guard around the waist with his own arms, pinning the guard&#8217;s hands to his side.  The human, in an unbelievable feat of strength, lifted the guard off his feet and with a quick movement and a sound like a branch breaking, snapped the spine of the guard.  The human, throwing the guard down like a broken doll, looked around to see the other guard running towards him with a short sword drawn.  The human picked up the dead guard&#8217;s whip with one hand and a stone as large as a fist with the other.  As the guard got a few paces away from the human, the human threw the stone at the guard.  The guard was expecting the stone and raised his buckler to deflect the object.  However as the guard raised his buckler, he did not see the human take an impossibly long step towards him.  The guard was very surprised as he lowered the buckler to see the chest of the human directly in his path.  The guard tried to raise his weapon, but the butt of the whip had already come crashing down, caving in the guard&#8217;s skull.  The human looked around and saw no more guards.  In fact, all of us slaves looked around and saw no more guards.  I suddenly did not feel so good.  Yes, I was a slave, but I was Iksar and a young Iksar at that.  If any of these slaves decided to take out their frustration out on someone, the most likely target was I.  Luckily, the slaves where not interested in retribution, they were interested in freedom.  With a roar that made my scales rattle, the human grabbed the guard&#8217;s sword and buckler and lifted them in the air.  All the slaves suddenly had a choice, follow this large human and probably be killed or stay at the worksite and certainly be killed.  They chose to run.  In a croaking, screaming, roaring hoard, the slaves ran out of Cabilis toward the Swamp of No Hope.  I suppose they headed that direction because most of the slaves where frogloks captured within that swamp.  I was told later that all where killed as they tried to escape.  I believe that for the most part.<br> <br>Squire Mharkas found me later all alone at the site moving rocks.  &#8220;When I heard about the uprising, I decided to come down and see how you faired.  Are you well?&#8221;<br><br>I stopped from moving rocks and looked at Squire Mharkas.  &#8220;Yes.  I am fine.  And I have figured out the lesson, Squire.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You have, slave?  And what lesson would that be?&#8220;<br><br>I looked around the site, &#8220;After the human killed the guards today, I was suddenly aware that there where only two guards.  There were at least fifty slaves.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes.  Continue.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220; Slavery is an exercise in the use of power.  By using other&#8217;s power, you do not deplete your own.  By using the workforce of the other races around us, the Iksar can use it&#8217;s own power for other more productive pursuits.  I made the mistake of using the force from myself to power the lightstone instead of using the other forces around me, thereby making myself weak and vulnerable to the beating you gave me.&#8221;  I looked into the face of Squire Mharkas knowing I had come up with the correct answer.<br><br>She did not say anything.  She reached out and took my hand.  &#8220;Time you go home, hatchling.  You need a bath.&#8221;<br><br>I slept well that night.  The first time I slept well in what seemed a very long time.   However, that lesson changed the way I looked at my life.  Squire Mharkas would not find me as open to suggestion as before.  She would also find that I would never again be placed in a position of weakness easily.<br><br>Part 7.<br><br>&#8220;Squire Mharkas, are you my mother?&#8221;<br><br>Squire Mharkas purposefully put down the scroll she was reading and turned to me standing in the door of her study.  &#8220;Why do you ask, hatchling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;One of the other hatchlings was taking about how he had hatched with his siblings in the home of his parents.  I remember hatching to your face.  You have never said you where my mother, but I thought it might be the case.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No.  I am not your mother.&#8220;<br><br>&#8220;May I ask who is my mother and father, Squire?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No.  I will tell you someday, but today is not that day, hatchling.  Now leave me, I have studies to perform.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Squire.  Thank you.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am humbled by your response to Shrikke's Bio.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just hope these aren't getting too long for everyone to enjoy.  Please feel free to make suggestions and comments.  I have a pretty thick skin.  Good hunting.<br><br>Part 4. <br>  <br>Soon after the death of the halfling slave, my daily routine changed.  Up to that point, I would usually have a day with balanced amounts of eating, sleeping and playing organized by Squire Mharkas or one of slaves.  Added to my routine just before bed, was a time of meditation with Squire Mharkas.  I, like most two year olds had very little experience with sitting in one place for extended periods of time and would often not be meditative for very long.  I would try my best to stay quiet and concentrate on whatever topic the Squire had given to me, usually without much success.  It was odd to me at the time, as stringent as Squire Mharkas was about most of my activities; she was patient in this one.  No matter how often I would ask a question or squirm about on my pillow, she would quietly remind me of the task at hand.<br> <br>It was a number of cycles of the moon before I had any idea of the purpose of this nighttime ritual.  This night, Squire Mharkas told me a tale of a Lord Shadowknight named Dzanthul.  This Lord was given the task of killing a giant that had been plundering the countryside and killing many Iksars.  He had no trouble finding the giant.  The brunt had left a trail of death and carnage that a blind froglok could follow.  When he finally had caught up with the giant, he found a score of Iksars skinned and hung in the trees ready to be eaten.  Enraged by the sight, Dzanthul rushed into clearing to kill the giant.  The Shadowknight did not know that the giant had a helm that made him invisible and did not see the swinging axe the giant wielded.  The blow from behind caught Dzanthul in the ribs underneath the arm, throwing the Knight into a heap on the edge of the clearing.  The blow would have killed the Lord Shadowknight if not for his magical Dreadscale armor.  The giant thinking the Shadow Knight dead, sat down to feast on the skinned Iksars.  Halfway through the meal, the giant heard a moan come from the fallen Knight.  The Knight was regaining consciousness.  The giant cursed himself for not making sure the Shadowknight was dead and picked up a very heavy stone to crush the Lord.  At that moment, Dzanthul regained consciousness and rolled on to his back.  Seeing the giant coming towards him, with the large rock over his head, the Shadowknight quickly cast a spell of Steal Strength upon the giant.  The giant, weakened, was unable to hold on the to rock.  The rock came then crashing down upon the giant&#8217;s head, killing him.  The Lord Shadowknight plundered the body of the giant, taking the helm for his own, and returned to his home as a hero.<br><br>I asked Squire Mharkas if the story was true.  She said that the story was true.  I then asked her how the Lord had cast the spell.  She said that he had practiced for many years to sense the forces around him and that through controlling those forces; he was able to absorb the strength of the giant.  I knew I could ask one more question before Squire Mharkas and I began our nightly exercise.  I asked when was I going to be able to start practicing like the Shadow Knight Lord.  She said that I already had started.  <br><br>Then I understood.<br><br>Part 5.<br><br>I was in my fourth year.  As was the custom, after the morning meal, I would be taken by one of slaves to a courtyard just outside of the Temple to play with other Iksar hatchlings.   Throwing sticks and balls, chasing each other around the courtyard, and swimming in the canals where common activities.  Occasionally, one of the adult Iksars would organize a game of hide and seek.  Little did we know how important that particular game would become to our continued existence.<br><br>I remember a day when the sun shone high in the sky and was hot even before midday.  We asked the supervising Trooper if we could go down to the canals to swim.  Even at four years, an Iksar is at home in the water.  The Trooper said no, without explanation.  This confused our little playgroup.  The sun was hot and the canal was not running swiftly.  Why would he not let us swim?  He was being cruel without cause.  We crowded around the Trooper, asking incessantly for him to allow us swim.  His face grew hard and with a sweep of his pike he pointed towards the canal and told us to swim all we wanted.  <br><br>We all started running to the canal, suddenly a thought occurred to me and I stopped.  I turned toward the trooper, &#8220;What is the reason you do not want us to swim?&#8221;<br><br>He looked at me blankly.  &#8220;Funny that you ask, but as your playmates will find out, this is the time of year when the fish in the canals are breeding.  They will attack anything that jumps into the water. &#8220;  <br><br>Without thanking the trooper, I turned and ran after my friends yelling, trying to warn them about the fish.   They did not hear me.  Most were fortunate and got out of the water before the fish did any real damage.  Two of those playmates, I never saw again.  And one was considered &#8220;lucky&#8221; because the fish did not kill him, but took only an arm.  That hatchling now works in the slave pens, passing out meals and removing the filth. I would like to hear, sometime, his comments about luck.<br><br>The Trooper brought me before Squire Mharkas and told the story. I stood listening to the story with my head hung low.  I was ready for my punishment.  I was not sure why, but I felt as if I had failed my friends and Squire Mharkas.  Failure always has an effect and I was ready to come to terms with that effect.  The Trooper finished the story, bowed to Squire Mharkas and left our rooms.  I looked up, expecting a harsh conclusion to this day, to see the Squire looking pleased.  She must have seen the look of confusion on my face, because she knelt down, so she could talk to me eye to eye.<br><br>&#8220;I would have been angry if you had jumped in the canal with the other hatchlings.  You would have had your life made uncomfortable for many cycles of the moon.  I would have been angrier if you had died today.  So angry, I would have raised your bones and used them as an example to my next student as to what happens to foolish hatchlings that do not think through an event through before acting.   You did think today before you acted.  You asked the correct questions at the correct time.  That is success.  The hatchlings that were lost today are lost because they failed that test.  They were your friends and I&#8217;m sure you feel sorrow, but we Iksar do not have the luxury of surrounding ourselves with fools.  Even if those fools are our friends or our students.  Foolishness only leads to death.&#8221;  She paused and took my hand in hers.  &#8220;You pleased me today and today I will give you a reward for your success. &#8220;  In my hand, I felt her place the cold form of a crystal.<br>	<br>&#8220;What is this,&#8221; I asked, turning my hand over to look at the clear crystal.<br><br>&#8220;This is a lightstone&#8230;a burntout lightstone.  It comes from a creature called a willowwisp.  A normal lightstone shows a clear light.  This one does not have that ability on it&#8217;s own anymore.  However, if a person can concentrate hard enough and bring the correct forces to bear on the stone, it can again shine brightly.  I bought it for you too practice with when we meditate each night.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Thank you, Squire Mharkas,&#8221; taking the stone and placing it in my pocket.<br>	<br>&#8220;One more thing hatchling, do not tell anyone about the crystal. And I do mean anyone, not a slave or another hatchling.  To do so could have effects that neither of us will be able to deal with.  Do you understand?&#8221;<br>	<br>&#8220;I understand, Squire. I will obey.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>
