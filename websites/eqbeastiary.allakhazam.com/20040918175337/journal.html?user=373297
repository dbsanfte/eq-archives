Daughter of a Scorekeeper Priestess, Atwinn, and former and deceased Bounty Hunter, Trossk, Atlan was hatched on Trossk's starship, the Eliminator.

Trossk was killed when Jabba the Hutt put a bounty on the Trandoshan BH for failure to deliver on multiple contracts.  The ship, Eliminator, was salvaged and sold by Atwinn, and the Priestess moved her brood to Naboo.

Atlan swore vengeance on Jabba and upon reaching her adult age, she left Naboo and went to Tatooine, seeking to gain Jabba's trust and formulate the plan to kill the slimy slug.

Conflicting tales from Jabba's palace and others have kept Atlan from attempting the assassination, although she trusts Jabba about as much as she would trust...well...anyone.

Enemies:  Too numerous to name.

Allies:  A chosen few that have the guts to stand up for what they believe in. To them, Atlan has given her loyalty and skills.

I figured it was another job; so, I packed my gear, took two of my pets with me on the shuttle, and made my way to Dantooine.<br><br>The abandoned Rebel base is not hard to find, although it is usually overrun with quenkers and other Dantooine wildlife.  To my surprise, though, there was a small garrison of Rebels there, led by an Officer named Ackbar, a Mon Calamari, and Mon Mothma, a Human.<br><br>I had heard Ackbar's name mentioned from time to time by my Rebel contact, but not Mothma's.  THAT should have triggered to me that she was of importance, rather than trivial, but I had no idea HOW important.<br><br>Mothma called me into a small room, littered with broken electronics as well as the local creature droppings.  I stepped upon a pile of bones, making my way to a chair that Mothma had pointed to, and the crunching seemed to echo in the loneliness of the darkened room.<br><br>Mothma sat down opposite me; a small framed, almost petite Human, I towered over her, even sitting, but somehow, rather than making me feel powerful and arrogant, (as it usually does), I wanted to make myself smaller...already, I felt a respect for this female that still puzzles me.<br><br>&quot;Sergeant Wills, thank you for coming so quickly,&quot; Mothma began.<br><br>I blinked at the use of my Alliance rank; the work that I've done for the Rebellion has been so sporadic and so mercenary in style, that I rarely even remember that I HAVE a rank assigned to me.<br><br>Mothma pulled out a datapad from the pockets of her robe, &quot;Alliance Heroism Medal...Alliance Valorious Services Medal...Rebel Badge of Courage,&quot; she glanced up at me, &quot;you've done some good work for the Alliance.  Very dangerous work.&quot;<br><br>I didn't know what to say to that so I just nodded.  Yes, I had done dangerous work, and not so dangerous work, for the Alliance.  Like I said, they paid well.  If they wanted to give me medals and badges along with the credits, that was no problem for me.<br><br>&quot;The Alliance is very fortunate to have you and your skills on our side of the Galactic Civil War,&quot; Mothma continued.<br><br>I nodded; that I could understand.  The Empire had enough firepower and ruthlessness already; they didn't need mine.<br><br>&quot;Your last assignment was the rescue of the prisoners from the Imperial Corvette,&quot; Mothma nodded in return, &quot;you led that mission with a strike team.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I did indeed,&quot; I replied, finally finding my voice, &quot;it's a good team.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Again, the Alliance is fortunate to have your Association as an ally in this fight against darkness.&quot;<br><br>Agreed again, though I didn't say so.  My Association is one of the most finely tuned in the galaxy.  From rescues to detonation, and just about everything in between, we are effective and precise.<br><br>&quot;I have some news for you,&quot; Mothma said, leaning back now and putting away the datapad.<br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot; I said before I even realised it.  What did she mean?  I hate when Humans get all mysterious; it seems to make them feel powerful while it only annoys me to the point of wanting to rip out their eyes.<br><br>&quot;You told General Madine sometime ago, when you first took a job with us, that your mother and three siblings had been killed on Naboo.  You thought by the Empire, yes?&quot;<br><br>I nodded, &quot;Yes, I returned home just over a year ago and found the house in ruins and the remains of my family.&quot;<br><br>My voice was calm, but the rage began to awaken from deep inside of me.<br><br>All that blood...<br><br>&quot;We have a young Trandoshan, a male, who says his name is Trissk.  He was rescued from the Imperial Prison on Dathomir about a month ago.  When he told us his story and mentioned his family's names, we came to believe that he might be your brother.&quot;<br><br>I swallowed involuntarily as my mouth went suddenly dry.  I blinked again.<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;  I said stupidly.<br><br>&quot;We believe that Trissk is your brother from a younger nesting,&quot; Mothma smiled, &quot;we are going to arrange a meeting for the two of you, but he had some other news that we feel you will want to hear.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where is he?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He has requested to be assigned to an infantry squad, so he is currently on Corellia awaiting that assignment.  You have clearance to see him at any time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And the other news?&quot;  I whispered.<br><br>&quot;Trissk told us that while two other brothers were indeed killed during the incident that led to his imprisonment, your mother was not.  Atwinn was recognised by the Imperial captain who led the raid as a Scorekeeper Priestess and was taken to the Emperor himself--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait,&quot; I stammered, &quot;my mother is alive?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She is,&quot; Mothma nodded, &quot;and on Naboo.&quot;<br><br>Naboo.  I have a house on Naboo.  I travel to Naboo all the time.  My mother is there?  Alive?<br><br>Mothma could see the confusion upon my face.<br><br>&quot;She was taken to the Emperor's Retreat and tortured relentlessly for the Emperor's amusement...he seems to have a particular dislike for Trandoshans, much like his distaste for Wookiees, where he feels that slavery and hard labour are about all that Trandoshans are good at.&quot;<br><br>My eyes focused again, and I could breathe.<br><br>&quot;Where is she now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;When the Emperor had broken her, she no longer interested him, so she was taken to the Geonisian Cave to work.  Her special gift was discovered by the Empire.  They wanted to put it to 'good' use.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gift?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The same gift that you possess, Atlan.  Your gift of communicating and working in partnership with other creatures.&quot;<br><br>I said nothing.  One of the Sacred Gifts, among my own people, is not mentioned so casually.<br><br>&quot;Your mother finally made her escape from the facility and went into hiding.  It seems she persuaded some of the animals in the facility to aid her in this...in the chaos, Atwinn got out and lived in the wilderness for the next few months.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How do you know all of this?&quot;  I interrupted.  &quot;Trissk couldn't have known if he just got out of prison himself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, Trissk did not know this.  He knew that your mother was not killed in the raid, but beyond that, he could not say.  It was your mother herself who came to the Alliance.  She ran into a party of pilots who had crash landed.  When the pilots were rescued, Atwinn went with them and told her story.  She was taken to the Rebel outpost on Rori; she's been there ever since working as a healer for that garrison.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She's on Rori? I thought you said Naboo?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She was on Rori. Once we heard Trissk's tale, we decided to see if we could find any trace of Atwinn.  We finally found a Trandoshan female working at the Rori outpost.  Not many Trandoshan females in the Alliance, Atlan, and not that many off of Dosh either.&quot;<br><br>That was true enough.  The look in Mothma's eyes as she said this gave me the understanding that she knew how fierce the Hatching of my kind is; only one Dosh survives each Hatching, very rarely is that survivor female.<br><br>&quot;It didn't take long to verify that she is Atwinn Wills,&quot; Mothma finished.  &quot;She's frail, though, Atlan, so be prepared when you see her.  She sustained injuries during her time at the Retreat that even the best surgeons cannot heal completely.  When we told her that we had you and Trissk, she nearly fainted with relief.  It seems that, contrary to popular conception, Trandoshans do have a strong sense of family.&quot;<br><br>I nodded, &quot;The bond between a mother and her brood is much different than that of the father's.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We have learned much about the Trandoshan people from you, your brother, and your mother.  We are honoured and fortunate to have done so.&quot;<br><br>I said nothing.  I suddenly felt like I was in a dream.  Afraid to move lest I wake.<br><br>&quot;I assume that you would like to see your mother as well?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yes....yes, of course,&quot; I nodded.<br><br>&quot;She is on Naboo.  Your usual contact will meet with you and arrange it,&quot; Mothma leaned back towards me, &quot;I see no reason, Atlan, why your mother could not now retire, in peace, at your home there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If that is what she wishes,&quot; I said slowly.<br><br>&quot;Good,&quot; Mothma smiled brightly, suddenly looking younger and not so tired, &quot;then one last thing.&quot;<br><br>Ah, the catch!  I crossed my legs and shifted in my seat.<br><br>&quot;We would like to employ your services in a more regular manner,&quot; she said, &quot;you will remain Covert, but we want you to lead up a covert team.  You will be the leader of an Alliance cell of operatives.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A black ops team?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; Mothma nodded again, &quot;a team that will receive orders directly from me,&quot; she retrieved a datapad from a different pocket and handed it to me.  &quot;You will receive targets and objectives via this datapad.  The instructions are only to be found in this manner.  Should you fall into the hands of the Empire, this datapad must be destroyed by any means possible.  Understood?&quot;<br><br>I nodded, taking the datapad.<br><br>&quot;Continue your business as usual,&quot; Mothma continued, &quot;do not change a thing about your normal routine.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who else is on the team?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;That is entirely up to you,&quot; Mothma replied.<br><br>&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You form the cell, Atlan,&quot; Mothma nodded, &quot;The members will not even be made known to me. You will operate as you see fit with the objectives given to you.  As long as the result is what we ask for, we don't care how you do it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good,&quot; Mothma stood up and reached into her pocket again, &quot;oh, and congratulations, Lieutenant.&quot;<br><br>She handed me a pair of items that I recognised as Alliance military insignia.<br><br>&quot;Lieutenant?&quot; I said, taking the insignia.<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; she then pointed to a spec ops pack lying nearby, &quot;in there you will find an Alliance Officer's uniform and an Officer's formal uniform.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eh..what do I need uniforms for if I'm to be Black Ops and Covert?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is to be a medal ceremony for the strike team that rescued the prisoners from the corvette,&quot; she smiled, &quot;I insist that you attend and receive your medal,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;in uniform.&quot;<br><br>I picked up the spec ops pack and frowned, &quot;I supposed you'll tell me more about that, too, when the time is right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed, I will.  Farewell, Lieutenant, May the Force be with you.&quot;<br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Bounty Hunters....Your Kind of Scum</td></tr>

Nevertheless, the time on Tat has been good for me.  Along with other members of my Association, i have done a great deal of research while here in tracking some interesing goings ons.  <br><br>Information, by the way, can sometimes be worth  more than a warm body.<br><br>I do not record much about my Association as it is dangerous to leave recorded materials about such undertakings, especially if I choose to use names in the recordings.  Suffice it to say that times are indeed dangerous; some cities, even on Tatootine, are not safe to even use the spaceport.  I, and those of my Association, are known to the Empire, this we have discovered on several occasions, and if searched, arrest, or even death, is highly possible.  <br><br>Our business upon Tat has been good, though; our reputation here is also known and respected.  Feared by some.  Through my work, and the work of other members, we are welcomed on Tat and able to conduct business as usual.  <br><br>I will record that the Association is sympathetic to the Rebellion.  In fact, we no longer allow membership unless the applicant is, at least, a Rebel Sympathizer.  None of us are &quot;active&quot; military personel for the Alliance, but we do lend our talents when we can, provide transportation on occasion, and of course pass along information from time to time.<br><br>In fact, just this month, the Association, (which shall remain nameless for now), formed a task squad and boarded an Imperial corvette with the goal of setting a self destruct.  It was dangerous beyond belief and if we weren't in the  chaos of intense battle, we were in the tension of making our way through the vette as quietly as possible.  My Trandoshan passion for such things peaked numerous times throughout the mission; I actually found myself laughing at one point as an Imperial stormtrooper fell at my feet in a bloody, smoking heap.<br><br>Let me say this now:  There is nothing more intoxicating than carrying an LLC, while in full armour, all buffed and spiced up, and leaving carnage in my path.<br><br>We took the vette down; Lezo and Raspo, (the same Raspo who got me out of the Inquisitor's prison), are almost musical, I must say, in their ability to maneuver in such intense situations.  I have no head for logical thought during battle, and the Association knows this.  Even my comrade, Hatake, who is what we Trandoshans call 'sskit', watches me warily in such situations, for my claws and fangs can leave deep gashes that run freely with fresh blood...<br><br>**sskit in Dosh means 'invincible'; usually a battle reference <br><br>I am still on Tatooine, allowing the heat from the twin suns to penetrate my inner being and awaken and nurture as needed.  The Inner Mysteries of the Scorekeeper are known to me, thanks to my mother and her teachings, and I know that the key to my success as a Hunter and Daughter lies deeply within.  Though I have not told this to my non Trandoshan comrades, the Hibernation sleep that I awoke from just a few months ago was a voluntary sacrifice on my part to the Scorekeeper.  It is part of the journey towards what we call Kah; Kah being the ultimate state of awareness.  Those that reach Kah are almost godlike among my own people.  Few attain it, but even those that walk the path are respected.  The Kah Temples are also few and difficult to find; though not secret, they are purposely placed in isolated areas.<br><br>My Mentors have been few, but they have been potent with their teachings.  I shall record those teachings, I have decided, during my stays here at the House of the Twin Suns...for I have decided to make my home on Tatooine a sanctuary for others who walk the Path of Kah. The Kah'ssk will recognise it for what it is when they see it as the Signs will be obvious to their eyes and senses.<br><br>The holocron recordings for the Kah will be made separately from this main journal holocron.<br><br>I end this for now.<br><br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Bounty Hunters....Your Kind of Scum</td></tr>

I have come here to continue to heal and try to regain the mental discipline that I need to continue and thus complete my chosen paths. <br><br>Hunting trophies, weapons, both antique and deadly, along with a private terminal that allows me to research the many available databases, both legal and not, for my work is at this home.  I do not share the location with many; and the few who know of it do not come here without great need.  I have the house fully wired with an alarm system and the codes have been sliced so that even a Master Smuggler would need precious time to break them.  Nothing is impenetrable, this is true, but no one will gain entry to the House of the Twin Suns without paying dearly for it.<br><br>For if you manage to break the entry codes, after you step foot into the house, the internal alarm will engage.  I shall not record here precisely what engages, but I doubt that many would survive the....greeting.<br><br>As I flew into Mos Eisley two days ago, I ran into a fellow Bounty Hunter that was none too deep in the intellect department.  She wasn't even intelligent enough to be embarrassed at having had to ask a Trandoshan for help with the problem!  The girl had a mark that was a smuggler who had stolen some equipment from somebody or other.  She had narrowed it down to 5 smugglers in Mos Eisley and was detaining them for questioning.<br><br>Detaining them for questioning?  I've been a Bounty Hunter, both licensed and not, for over twenty years.  I've questioned very few marks with anything but a blaster.  I would have thought her an Imperial spy, except that I know Imps don't send females on jobs such as these and especially females that show such dim witted intelligence.<br><br>Then again, maybe there was something in it for me.  I know:  my inner Mercenary kicks in again.  What can I say?  I LIKE being comfortably wealthy.  <br><br>Turns out the smugglers, by and large, were a bunch of lying thugs.  They whined about being detained, but when I growled at them or sneered, I could see that flicker of fear in their eyes.  I have yet to meet a non Trandoshan who did not have a healthy respect for our fangs, claws, and infamous short tempers.  And, I can do the DEATH GLARE quite well.<br><br>Didn't take me long to figure out who was the culprit:  an even dumber blond named Eenach, (where do humans get such strange names?)<br><br>I pointed the mark out to the BH, who nearly giggled with relief, and then she gave me this really strange, glowing....odd...thing.<br><br>It looks amazingly alike, although differing in shape, the items that I got from killing that huge pig up North and for helping arrest those pirates.  <br><br>My mother having been a Scorekeeper Priestess, I'm a pretty superstitious lizard.  Whenever synchronicity or coincidence begins to pop up regularly, I begin to take notice.<br><br>I am going to continue my recovery on Tat and do some local hunting in a day or so.  Lizards heal fast, so I should be 100% within a day or so more.  Perhaps more signs will come forth...<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Bounty Hunters....Your Kind of Scum</td></tr>

I finally was granted an audience with Valarian in Mos Eisley.  Being a female, it seems, worked to my advantage this time:  Valarian was thrilled to take me on as a hired gun.  I spent almost a month with her at the Lucky Despot, (actually enjoying myself--Valarian quarters, feeds, and entertains her staff VERY well), and she pays MUCH better than Jabba the Slug does.  When all was said and done, Valarian had nicknamed me her &quot;Ice Tiger&quot;, granted me the Valarian Assassin Dagger (by which I can be identified by other Valarian Clan), and granted me my own private quarters in the Despot cantina.  I must say:  a successful venture.  I am clear to conduct my own business as I see fit on Tatooine.<br><br>I have also managed to make myself more than welcome on Lok, too.  Nym, who, like me, is very sympathetic to the Rebellion, let me run a few jobs for him.  He was more than pleased with my results and now I am welcomed in his stronghold with open arms, comfortable quarters at his own headquarters, and food/drink for the taking.<br><br>Was it my mother who told me that the life of a mercenary was hard?<br><br>Mother.<br><br>That thought leads me to my recent visit to the Lake Retreat region on Naboo.  I had not gone there since discovering the ruins and carnage last year.  It was not surprising to find an Imperial Weapons Facility set upon the very ground where my mother's home used to exist.  I was unable to control the Trandoshan rage that boiled within me.  I rampaged through the facility like a berserker of old and only when I was finally brought down did I realise the folly of my actions.  I was one against hundreds.  Though I had left a path of blood, entrails, and smoked flesh in my wake, I alone was no match for the entire Imperial garrison.<br><br>I was taken immediately to an Imperial simply called the Inquisitor.  Suffice it to say that four hours at his hand did not loosen my tongue or force me to betray anything of the Rebellion, but the blood and flesh that I left upon the polished white floor shall leave more than physical scars upon me.  I thought that I should finally be killed at his hands...but a comrade of mine from the Alliance, Raspo, got wind somehow of my situation.  Within hours, he was wreaking havoc of his own within the facility and I was able to use the distraction to join him in the fight.  We finally both broke free of the walls....<br><br>I got to Corellia as quickly as I could and found refuge in a safehouse that belongs to one of my recent hunting partners, Cubby.  Cubby is a Wookiee, and though I have gotten much grief from other Trandoshans about my alliances with Wookiee partners, I have found them to be loyal and fierce fighters.  <br><br>So, here I rest and heal...nightmares of the Inquisitor, my mother...blood and feasting upon the corpses of my enemies...I fear that I am losing my mind and the hold upon the discipline that I have worked so hard to maintain.  I have prided myself upon my education, my skills not only with weapons but with languages and espionage, and my ability to NOT lose control and give into my Trandoshan base desire for blood and death.<br><br>But the Inquisitor touched the deep down, base part of my inner being.  I am not sure when it shall be unleashed again...or if I can control it.<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Bounty Hunters....Your Kind of Scum</td></tr>

Why Coronet?  The intrigue was enough to cause me to actually want to make the meeting.<br><br>TWO DAYS LATER.  CORONET,CORELLIA.  CORELLIAN SYSTEM  <br><br>At the state Guild House, where several of the galaxy's guilds have rooms and offices, I found the BH Guild's agent.  <br><br>Zuckuss.<br><br>I hesitate only slightly as I approach the heavily apparatused creature. His breathing helmet and tangle of associated cords and wires momentarily distract me, but I quickly move my eyes back to lock onto his.<br><br>Few can endure the staring gaze of a Trandoshan with their own eyes.  Zuckuss is no different; he quickly looks away and motions to a nearby chair in the small room.  We are alone.<br><br>&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Zuckuss's hand rests easy on his thigh, none too far from his carbine.<br><br>I nod and wonder why he's thanking me for answering a Guild Summons; five years ago, if one refused such a Summons, one could expect a bounty put upon one's head that would and usually did end one's life very quickly.  <br><br>I simply nod and continue to study my counterpart's movements and body language.<br><br>&quot;I am here on behalf of Bossk, the new Master of the Bounty Hunter's Guild,&quot;  Zuckuss pronounces these words very slowly and effectively, carefully watching me now for my reaction.<br><br>Yes, I am shocked, but clearly I must not allow any of that to show visibly.  Bossk as Master of the Guild?  Was Cradossk dead then?  He had to be...<br><br>&quot;I see,&quot; is all I reply.<br><br>&quot;He was sad to see you leave the Guild last year, but was most thrilled to see your license renewed and your application to the Guild received last month,&quot; Zuckus continued delivering his rehearsed lines, &quot;in fact, he is so anxious to have your membership reinstated that he has sent me, his current partner and acting Second Officer of the Guild, Zuckuss, to ensure that all is in order for your membership to be completed.&quot;<br><br>A slight chill invades my spine.  Odd.  Why would Bossk have such an interest in my rejoining the Guild?  Simply another number to add to his charter?  Our shared Trandoshan ancestry and culture? It could not be much more than that; I did not know Bossk well at all and had tried to avoid him when I was within the Guild Hall on business.  My reputation, such that it is, is nothing more or less than what one should expect from a female Trandoshan Bounty Hunter,and Bossk would know that. I am quite proud of the fact, it is true, that I have been granted the license to use the  term, &quot;Lethal&quot;, in my skillset with my last BHL renewal.  Perhaps that had caught Bossk's eye?<br><br>Again, though, even that was nothing compared to the attentions and ambitions of self centered and ambitious as Bossk.  <br><br>I have been working pretty regularly for House Trefarious...I wonder if THAT had caught his eye...<br><br>&quot;So...all is in order?&quot;  Zuckuss leaned forward slightly.<br><br>I suddenly had an intuition that Zuckuss might talk...if persuaded in the right manner.<br><br>My eyes narrowed into a Trandoshan look of annoyance, &quot;Cut to it, Master Second, I have work to do.&quot;<br><br>Zuckuss shifted slightly, seemingly not quite sure what to say, &quot;Well...,&quot; his eyes met mine again, &quot;since you did not ask, I assume you already knew that Cradossk is dead along with...several other key members of his regime.&quot;<br><br>I had not known that, but I did now.  And what others?<br><br>&quot;I have ears.  Go on,&quot; I leaned forward so that I was towering over Zuckuss where he sat opposite me.  <br><br>Trandoshans really are large intimidating creatures.  I often use that fact to my advantage, and then laugh until I cry thinking about it afterwards when I relax with my spice bong....but that's another story...<br><br>&quot;Bossk is now firmly in the Grand Master's chair,&quot; the smaller BH was speaking faster.<br><br>&quot;Which means he isn't firmly in the chair at all,&quot; I stated flatly, &quot;sounds like a party that I don't care to attend.  There's enough politics goin on in the galaxy, I personally don't need anymore.&quot;<br><br>Something about my own statement struck a chord deep within me....was there a connection  between the BH Guild's apparent political war and the Galactic Civil War?  No, surely not....the small bit of espionage that I had been performing for the Rebels was probably distorting my view of the whole situation.  I didn't want to get myself too involved; I enjoyed taking small bites out of the vast Empire, but I could not afford to become so entangled that I lost sight of my own personal goals.<br><br>Zuckuss took note of the change in my demeanour.  I put the face of intimdation back on and coughed.<br><br>&quot;Look,&quot; Zuckuss lowered his voice, surprising me, &quot;obviously you knew about the...change in the guard, so to speak.  But you might not know why.&quot;<br><br>I shrugged and motioned with my right claws for him to continue; I had to admit, I was completely intrigued.<br><br>&quot;Boba Fett joined the Guild a few weeks ago,&quot; Zuckuss leaned closer, &quot;it set off all kinds of fireworks.&quot;<br><br>I nearly swallowed my tongue.  Fett had joined the BH Guild?!  Nonsense.  Why would he do that?  It made no sense...yet, I had heard the rumour myself.   When I had seen him last down at Jabba's, he had talked of the situation on Endor, but nothing about the Guild!<br><br>Then again, why would he mention it to me?  He didn't even know my name...had called me &quot;Sister&quot; ever since we had been introduced and had barely given me a second look even then.  <br><br>&quot;I am sure there were fireworks...indeed.  Go on,&quot; I coaxed.<br><br>&quot;Bossk is now the Grand Master; Cradossk is dead.  The old lizard had asked me to assassinate Bossk while we ran a team mission that was led by Fett.  I didn't comply.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Obviously,&quot; I said.<br><br>&quot;He may not be as firmly entrenched into the Chair as he'd like to be, but I assure you, he is well into the power and control.  With Fett's support, it's only a matter of time before the resistors are wiped out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How many are...gone?&quot;<br><br>&quot;178 members have been removed from the Guild's Charter membership,&quot; Zuckus replied.<br><br>I leaned back again, &quot;Do you have orders to kill me if I do not complete my application?  Beyond that, Master Second Officer, if I do rejoin, am I to be Bossk's 'do-girl'?&quot;<br><br>Zuckuss blnked in surprise, &quot;Well...err...&quot;<br><br>Ah, cleary Bossk did not prepare him for me to refuse. Then why had he sent him?  Why the personal visit and interest?<br><br>&quot;Tell Bossk that I have business to complete and then I will come and see him myself,&quot; I rubbed the dry scales of my claw absently, &quot;and I do not wish anymore Summons to be sent on this matter.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see,&quot; Zuckuss was clearly disturbed.  Perhaps he had been instructed to kill me if I refused.<br><br>&quot;I shall be going then,&quot; he stood and began to walk rapidly towards the door.  Was he going to shoot me from there?<br><br>I stood and faced him, making three quick strides to reach him, &quot;Why the hurry?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can see that you're getting angry...and I know a little about dealing with angry Trandoshans,&quot; he said.<br><br>I folded my arms across my chest, &quot;I see, and that is all well and good.  Except, I'm not getting angry and I'm not quite ready for you to leave just yet.  You might know the male Trandoshans of my species from your dealings with Bossk and his father, but I am sure that you have had no dealings with the females of my kind.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What makes you so sure?&quot; Zuckuss sounded offended.<br><br>&quot;Because there are no female Trandoshan bounty hunters in this galaxy besides myself,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;and I doubt that you've made any pleasure trips, or otherwise, to my homeworld.  Do you even speak Dosh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A little,&quot; he replied, &quot;but you're right about the other things....I've seen maybe three other female Trandoshans.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There's a good reason for that,&quot; I nod, &quot;I'm sure that Bossk has told you how a spawn is hatched?&quot;<br><br>Zuckuss swallowed and nodded, &quot;Yes, and how he killed and devoured his other siblings as they hatched...that is how, he says, it is with every Trandoshan spawning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He is correct,&quot; I grin, &quot;he didn't tell you that just to spook you, it's all very true.  Few females survive a spawning as, by genetics, we are weaker at hatching time.  Those females that do survive are...shall we say...a little stronger, a little faster, a little smarter...a little more...everything.  They have to be, or they'd be dead.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can understand that part,&quot; Zuckuss looked at me with a new respect in his eyes, &quot;but what about the female bounty hunter part?  You're right, I've never seen another Dosh BH that's a female, but--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let's just say that I LIKE being the only female Trandoshan BH,&quot; I say slowly.  <br><br>&quot;I see,&quot; Zuckuss looked away quickly, &quot;well.  I shall deliver your message to Bossk.&quot;<br><br>&quot;One more thing,&quot; I say, &quot;why is Fett in the Guild?  And WHY is he supporting Bossk?  Or...is he?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He is...at least....that's the game so far.  You never know with Fett, right?  I couldn't tell you what his game is.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; I nod, &quot;fair enough.&quot;  I hesitate, but then decide that I do like Zuckuss.  Well, I at least don't DISlike hime.  Yet.<br><br>&quot;If I were you, I'd watch what was going on very carefully.  It all sounds twisted and shadowy to me, looking in from the outside. I doubt that many people are going to join the Guild at this time, and rumours are spreading.  You're right, I knew most of your story before you told me, and the word on the street is that the BH Guild is a war zone.  House Trefarious, the Hutts, Valarian...they're all taking advantage of it.  Some are even hiring BHs as personal staff members with VERY nice salaries and benefits,&quot; I paused, &quot;anyway, just watch what's going on.  Not all is what it seems.&quot;<br><br>Zuckuss did not immediately reply, and then only nodded, &quot;Point taken and it's not the first time I've heard it or thought it myself.  I advise a watchful eye to you as well.&quot;<br><br>Something about how he said that, &quot;Meaning?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Meaning that some BHs...a lot of folks...are starting to take enhancements from docs to 'aid' them in their jobs.  Although it's perfectly legal, rumour has it that the Empire is about to either use it as a means to start arresting folks...or to keep track of them.&quot;<br><br>I nod slowly in return, &quot;I appreciate that.  While you're here in Coronet, keep an eye out for the Black Sun.  They like to use trackers, too, and rumour has it that the information can get to the Emperor himself through a certain piece of royalty.&quot;<br><br>I could see that my part of the offered exchange of information had been unknown to Zuckuss.  Good.  The exchange had been fair.<br><br>&quot;See ya,&quot; and Zuckuss was gone.<br><br><br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Bounty Hunters....Your Kind of Scum</td></tr>

(It still amazes me that non Trandoshans actually LIKE my species; especially a Trandoshan that is a Bounty Hunter and known to be short tempered!)  My hesitation was moreso that the memories of my childhood here might very well come crashing down upon me...or at least oppress me into suffocation.  Surprisingly, or perhaps not, rather than dreaming of my spawn siblings or my mother and our time here as younglings, my mind's eye only sees the bloody carnage that I found last year when I returned for that fateful visit.  And when I see that carnage, my bloodlust burns within me...all of the discipline taught to me by my mentors dissipates into crimson desire for revenge....<br><br>While in Kor Vella today, the STs decided to search me.  Again.  I waited patiently for them to discern my alignment and find my sliced weapons.  Minutes later, they all lay dead at my feet.  Blood and burnt flesh upon their white armour....the smell burned the sensitive scales around my nose, even with my helmet on and clamped down tightly.  I enjoyed watching them die, moreso than any mark or fool who decides he wants to test my abilities with claw or blaster....my hatred for the Empire is almost uncontrollable. When I think of how they slaughtered my family...<br><br>I must move on to other matters.  I must center myself and remember that focus is what will keep me alive for another day.<br><br>My application to the Bounty Hunter's Guild was accepted,  but I have not yet completed the process.  I have hard rumours that the Guild is becoming fractured and that Bossk is making his move to take over, (and I could never tolerate him as my leader!)...but the most amazing rumour was the one that I heard in Coronet today:  That Boba Fett had applied for membership.  Even more amazing, the informant told me that Cardossk accepted his application!  I am sure that Bossk is seething over this.  Yet, it is so hard to believe.  Why would Fett join after all this time?  What could he possibly need the BH Guild for?  I mean, if one wanted to join a BH organisation now, the one to join, from what I've seen and heard, would be House Tresarious.  I've done some jobs for them the last few days--they pay extremely well and offer little advice, if they say anything at all.  They are territorial, but being a Trandoshan, I can appreciate that.  So far, it has been a profitable arrangement.<br><br>So, what is Fett up to?  Or, is the rumour merely that...a rumour?  My curiousity is piqued.  There are few that I trust implicitedly, at least to tell the truth, Fett is one of them, as is Zuckuss, but I've not seen either of them in some weeks.  Detrix might know, and he hunts the same regions as me, so I may be able to find out more from him.  For the time being, I have left the BH Guild application as incomplete.  The &quot;I&quot; status will undoubtedly draw attention to me from the Guild, and perhaps even result in a Summons, but even that might be interesting.<br><br>We shall see.<br><br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Bounty Hunters....Your Kind of Scum</td></tr>

Interesting..as one of them died, he said something to the effect that (sounded like) Zizor would avenge him....<br><br>Zizor?  Could he possibly mean PRINCE Xizor?  Interesting development at any rate.  The Black Sun are a bunch of thugs and criminals that bring a bile of distaste to my throat...it would not surprise me if Xizor were involved with them.  But, I bet it WOULD surprise ole Palpatine.  Not that I'm going to venture to Naboo and tell the Emperor, but that information could come in handy later on.<br><br>I've not been back to Tat in almost a week.  My BH license was approved and I'm back takin down marks.  I have not heard from the BH Guild, and after hearing some rumours of what's going on with Bossk and Cardossk, I am thinking of withdrawing my application.  Maybe Fett was right; maybe the Guild is becoming weak and useless.  Time will tell.<br><br>I am taking a few days off and staying around Corellia.  The Black Sun/Xizor connection intrigues me.  That information could be worth a lot of credits to the right parties.<br><br>Got a message from Jabba a few days ago; seems he's not too terribly upset with my recent little war on some of his swoop gangs.  The note was short and sweet, and to the point, &quot;I like your kind of bounty hunting scum.&quot;  That fat slug is a walking...errr...floating contradiction.

She doesn't appear to have as many bodyguards as Jabba.  <br><br>But, then, I don't wish to kill her.

I'm sure that Jabba is more than angry.  I earned his trust and although I might not know all of the ins and outs of his operation, I know most of what happens here on Tatooine.  That information will be important to Valarian..and others.<br><br>Talon Karrde worked out as an ally on Corellia.  The cantina at Doaba Guerfel is a good meeting spot for my Corellia business.

I did some work for Borvo, which only proved to me what idiots CorSec really are, and then I got out of Moenia.
