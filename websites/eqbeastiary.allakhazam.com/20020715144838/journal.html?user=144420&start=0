	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nice spam Fazzy. ;) Anyway I forgot my password, so I can't log in. It's Kel at any rate.<br><br>Since we are told to comment in here, I'm going to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things haven't been going well for a couple of weeks on EQ for me.  It just seems either I'm dying, not getting experience, killing greens, or taking until 4am to decide what to kill. Of course that's part my fault, and with more people playing, the groups splitting is interesting, BUT after being up 20 hours and being really bored , tired, hungry....I personally just tend to become an annoying bish. So, ignore me please. =D <br><br>About some of the more recent groups, personally I think we have NO choice but to wait to get Eboots for everyone.  I just honestly don't think we can pull this one off at our levels without some better healing. If I can get to 51 or Phal can join us, it would really help. But it's really suicidal for the lower level people to go that far into (especially when things are even to me, and I'm ten levels higher ~_~) SOL B, not to even mention killing the guy. So I think we all need to get some just good old XP so we can go do things like that (and some non caster crap quests for Artak, poor guy...).  There is a lot of stuff I would love to do, but we aren't high enough yet.  Despite what YOU might think, pure willpower and stubbornness will not kill Naggy. =)<br><br>What else? Thanks again for the cloak. It was very sweet of you.  That's about it. ^_^<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well hmm what to say<br> wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;sure where to go and while swapping tl for a ruby focus (= extra 50-100 plus damge=GOOD/grin) i found a acrylia studded cloak that a mage wanted to  sell cheap. After asking around I found they went for around  2K and Phal guildieleader had bought one for 2.2K and considered it a  good deal. Well having 1k plus burning a hole  in the bank  and  not looking at buying spells for 4 levels i decided to splurge and get Kelvena a present). Unfortunately I didnt quite have the price that me and the magician agreed on. So i had her give me 300 plat went and paid the man off and got her a plus 10 wis cloak with other nice stats for A VERY   nice price. ?sigh reminds me of my  titan cloak i am  tryn for guess i will hire a ranger for a couple of hours lol.<br> ANyways in the process while talking to  phall and  the  rest i discovered he wanted Eboots well i want  them also and we decided that  would be an excellent place ter go hunting.<br>We gathered  llum  kel fazzy artak me and wen  to naggy joining with a pally we worked ourr way thro kolbolds and bats and beetles (hmmm sounds like me as a newb????). finally getting to the place wherre we needed to cross the lava  steeping stones we medded. Wanting to use my eye to scout i sent it acroos the lava. Oops er down into  the  lava hmmno way acroos with eye.<br> Fine no problems i  will  just lev and scout ahead alittle.  I see two imp protectors just ahead of me. As i attempted to con them they aggro me. getting hit by lesser damge spells i run to the group back across the lava. We get into a fightt with them. they hit verry hard and aggro instantly if you manage to get a spell off on them. in short order  the grp is wiped we regrp summon armor for the grp and head partially naked back in to cr getting hurt badly. Finally a kindly Monk pulls them corpses we res and loot. Another Monk who is hunting the Elord tells me that imp protectors are best dealt with around 49.<br> Bleh no i want to go killl them just  because of that comment weeeell and the  fact that we can  do  it also hehe. At this  point peeps have to camp so we start thinking on where to go. Epestle logs in around  this  time so  and needs to buy some spells from Skyshrine and so do i so me fazyen kelvena and herr all head for wakening lands to go there. Well after warning those that dunno abouut wueshi the dragon who lives by the WL ring. We port  after  30 secs of  being  there ep is attacked my wueshi ae root stunn damge hits us all she dies whil i am tryn to evac then llumien dies. Frozen rooted stunned doted and Scared outa are wits me kel and fazzy wait to be the next to die. Time passes..... birds chirp..... we continue to live.... dots pass... we start breathing again /grin hooray we LIVE! Now we have another rproblem as far as we can tell llumien aggroed the draggy cause he was singing for ep who isnt loved by the Claws of Yelniak as yet (takes a lotta kael giants to do that). We port llum back to find out he lives. Now we have another problem how to get  Epestle here safely without a WL port to her corpse doh(.<br>Lets see hmmm a fast jog to nexus down to gd and ez run thro ew and kael wherre she is hated and tada she will be there lmao. Ok so we really dont want to do that and hhave to deal with more  crs.<br>finally i get a cleric on the  horn in kael he is willing to do so. Kelvena grabs fazyen who gated out. me and llumine drag corpses to kale for the cleric to res. <br>In the midst of the res of llumine a Frost Giant shows up and starts beating on him and the cleric. The cleric roots him and yell for help llumien yells for me to zone. Hmm not wanting to watch me friend die again i take the easier choice and jump in rooting nuking and aggroing  to keep him offa llumien. ALmost dieng several  times we finally kill him close to when fazyen and kelvena show up. We heal up gear up zone several times because of fg aggro and finally invis run our arses to SS. When we con the critters  we all except ep have suficient fac to live ). Finding the library there I get my Cobalt Port spell while epestle is unable to find hers (.<br> We all crash and camp for the night.<br><br>Lessons<br>Isnt it amazing how a little greed or need can get peeps killed?<br><br>When my ego and EQ reality gamble Bet on the house odds<br><br>Wueshi is gonna die one of these days and my Ice comet or Dragon wrath spell will be the last thing that  goes  thro his head when it happens).<br><br>Hmm if i am gonna scout if i dont get  a chance to con i guess i should die where i stand and let the group pull my corpse or better yet if i cant scout with the eye then i would be better off bind sighting torad and haveing him scout lol<br><br>Be careful when you delete stuff you can't undo it(sorry kelvena for yer loss but i guess we get to kill more fgs in gd for a while)<br><br>Well all  in all it was an interesting night i just hope next  time  we can keep the  losses to a min with just as much adventure lol cy gh gl<br><br>&nbsp;<br>dungeon/quest/mob that is listed as five levels higher than mine own Thinking) .....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Lets c we went to&nbsp;&nbsp;kael  last nite ended  up with more peep than 6 so we  broke off  into 2grps with  a healer tank and  evacer in  each grp  and shared the the chanty. After we went to default channel 1 lummien started pulling for us and we traded off  on  the kills per grp. realising that wee really needed people to go  further Icalled on a warrior Kommerr (that i aggroed kited with in gd the nnight before hey if you aint got a healer what yerr gonns  do)? ), and a clerric named Maideth i gave them instructions on how to get to Kael thro the canyon and wee continued pulling. Llum got a bad pull of 4 ginats and wee all zoned except for fazyen who stopped to look for a sec lol(see my previous post of  that habit ). Well  with the cleric coming at leasdt he would get ressed. stop send  tell hmm warrior is dead just took a  100000 damge header off thhe canyon now all of my friends at one point or another have died going off the canyon to  Kael) but then i had informed  these folks  that  it  was there. Next thing you know sheval goes to  look and dies running at us with two fgs on  her. We kill them and then try  to  find  out  what happened I guess she wasnt aware of the fact that some of the  fgs can  cast spells. (mental  note  things  to watch  for). No  worrys we have a cleric  coming . Send  tell cleric ld clerric  logs back in and suddenly finds her slef almost  dead lying halfway down a steep cliff  looking over the  FG kael  guards me and llumine regrp to go out and save her  when suddenly she is gone(. We give ccareful  instructionns to  herr  and the  warrior. and when they show get their corpses bring them  to the  ent and regrp into two  grps again. After that other than a few close  moments We work ouur way thro the corridors killing fgs  left  and right almost to the  Kael Bank. Some have to crash afterwards and we grp  up with  some  5typluses who need fac and  lett  them  pull reds  and  yellows for  a while  till we all log. <br>I want to  go  back  to Kael  some  time again<br>All in  all we had  a fun  time tho we still have  to work  on the  communication  factor and exp  splitting.<br>Lessons<br>Geography is a dangerous thing to learn on the run<br>What you forget and  what you dont know can and will kill you.<br><br>Well I am  outa here cya on  the  flipside where i will be stirring up trouble as usual)<br>GH GL badkarma to all anonyers  EQ or alla or otherwise<br><br><br>Hey J you might want  to ask  your guardian and connie as to why you and e can stay over at antoinettes but cannot as yet come  over here ;)<br>Would be really interested in the excuses for that. cya love Uncle<br><br>&nbsp;<br>dungeon/quest/mob that is listed as five levels higher than mine own Thinking) .....

We barely killed them and the other adds then  Katzy had  to AFK and we had 5 more comepast  trying to kill  him while me artak and  fazyen frantically nuked hacked and  bound wounds tillhim  and  manea  came  back.  Oh well Fazzy got  new gloves and those titans can't  hide for ever.<br>       <br>  After evryone camped me and  fazzy were  still  awake so we  decided to  go  to mm to get him  an  epic  piece from  the  Ballroom. <br>After porting  there i  rethought the  decision (TG).

In  side the sewers (nice exp bonus notmany peeps) i  pulled smugs and thugs while kelvena pulled beggars and  thieves (bad  fac  for good and  the  bad  side of  queynos). In  a short  time  Fazzy alt went from 6 to  10. We decided to pl him  more  effectively with the sharkpit. Right by the  pit we  watched as Fazzy was suprised by a  brother ogre and  company pounding  his face in ( he lasted 2 seconds me and  kelvena  wereamazedby that because oneof them  was BTM at 44). I went  up, guided fazzy down and told him  to  wait in the  hallway  right outside the  room. Imagine  my surprise when i saw a naked ogre run past me to get aggroed and die a second time. Hmmm i guess Lurggood didnt Learngood.<br>After me and kelvena were done laughing I pulled his corpse up to the ent and brought him down.<br>We pulled a few more then took fazzy back to ogre country.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well lets see hmm what to say<br>Grats to Fazzy and Sondilla for their /ran (grumble whine loaded dice #$%^%$#) and aquisition of titan leggings and Cloak respectively.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lets see we have gone to Stonebrunt several days now hunting titans (#$% spirits). We also helped fazzy get pieces of  his epic and i twinked me war char with the stuff from the same  places)  Najena Kith Unrest Sol A. Anyways the Titan Spirits seem to be quite elusive we  only killed the Panda twice (tough mofo), Ghosty Ape once, the Snowbeast twice. prowler leopard once.  TG they drop several pelts at times. It is a boring camp killing  light blues and greens to get items that only benefit us int casters. After two days of that minimal danger (i only died once) tho it was fun running in circles almost dead while evryone worked on than pissed  off perma sowed snowbeast for 50 laps till he broke), We decided  to leave this place and go hunt elsewhere. <br>     We went to Mons Letalis with  llumien to hunt stuff for twilight armor. After lding and  not being  able terr log back in from zoning into sanctus i realised therre was a shorter ezer route and gated back to nexus. I zoned into Netherbian Lair<br>and grped with kel, tor, and lum and we headed thr marus seru to Mons. <br>      Since i like the shiknar in fungus not killinng me when i invis thro fungus to twilight, I suggested we leave the shiknar alone and  kill anything else. We killed stonegrabbers (earth rock kinda critters hit hard but  slow) and  rock hopperrs  got  a piece of my twilight armor quest items but had  no drops for the tankish type. After a while of camping torad left me and kelvena got bored and llum suggested we hunt teneb. <br>    We headed for the grey zone and found a large broken spire platform resting on a tall steep peak. Being a wizard and wanting to know  more about my ancestors ( and  maybe make off with some of their ancient powerfull items)), i convinced llum and kel to come with me to explore. We found a tunnel in a nearby canyon that seemed to connect. <br>     Inside we found the poor unded lost souls of wizards ( they obviously had been trapped there for conspiring with the evil druid aliance of yore that stole our earlier ports). So i convinced kelvena it was her duty  to help me and llumien free some  of these poor souls ( and maybe some loot). We buffed up and  killed a greater. Being a typical expansion verrant overcon (gotta l..ove verant logic) they hit in the 100s had lotsa hp nuked dsed feared, hted and  poisoned us but we managed to beat him (/blue con( ). He dropped nothing /sigh.  <br>    I was still curious about the Spire so after us almost dieing several times I solo invised lev and ran in up the spiral stair case to the top!). All the cons didnt see invis except one blue con lesser at the bottom. At the top there were greaters, one red con  spire Lord and a  Great Veiw)!. I plan to come back with a full grp to 'free' the rest of my brothers from  their undeath. <br>   We continued on to Teneb kited vamps with only a few deaths ( me and kelvena decided we could  quad them). Plan on going back to do so will just require better planning on our part).<br><br>    Thanx for the reses Spiritene) /Random Acts <br>Well am outa  here need ter go online cook dinner and all the rl and eq l type stuff cya round<br> May all your journeys be as interesting in the middle as the end GHGL )<br><br>PS Oh yes J tell your brother i miss and love you guys and tho i have to watch what i say on the phone (some people ..even relatives sadly cannot  always be trusted... exspecially when they are part of the cause for this situation)  if you want to talk about anything post me or email me.<br>So keep your chin up /grin.<br>  Love Uncle <br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed May 29 23:27:05 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>dungeon/quest/mob that is listed as five levels higher than mine own Thinking) .....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well I have been wanting to go ter the hole for a long while. I have always been scared (and curious) off falling off the cliff in Paineel into there. <br>So i heard that you needed to be 50s to go there or close too to 50. Naturally i had to read up on the place and start planning a trip there). All the info there mentioned a tank with lots of ac would be verry helpful as the critters at the ent resist a lot but illias showed them to be around our level ie 40 to 50. I logged in got the group<br>togetherr and&nbsp;&nbsp; wee headed to get keyz.<br>Inside we found a 52 pally hunting the ent so we grouped with him and cleared for a bit till he had to leave. NIce exp)! we then proceeded to keep the spawns clear as they poped  taking as singles was nice they hit hard but with ala us casters pets  ans tanks we dropped them fairly fast but the spawns were slow. So i scouted ahead and suggested we take a yellow that was down the stairs we buffed up moved down the stairs and jumped him it was ok until his buddy wandered up and the one above the stairs spawned also then i had to evac evryone dead except for me and one person. invising to grab bodies quikly i realised these guys saw invis doh( i ran down anyways wanting to make up for surviving. got aggro on  the way out and zoned after getting fazzy body with 40 hp left.  Katz got his body and kels. and then we proceeeded to die several  moretimes from strange aggro and other problems. after evryone dieing many times we regrouped and left with our tail between our legs and hunted in guk and got fazzy a eebag. Kelvena suggested hunting guk the next day. <br> The next day came around and i logged in depressed from  the nite before. After talk9ing to some  of the crew and  thinking about our situation  there i realised we hadn't tried to  figger out what we weren't doing  right and  instead kept going  back  in to  get deaed again for the same reasons. I then suggested we  go back in some  were hesistant about doing this  after so  much death (lol thanx for the trust guys you gotta be crazy). Any ways we regrouped with Giv a 52 monk friend of fabis . and Cleared the ent  then after  a bit  he logged so we had artak tank and  keep  the  spawns clear. When a strange  harvester poped up and  killed kelvena we had to escape and  couldnt find  a way to solo  pull after that so  we  left  and hunted  elsewhere for the nite. The last night we went  back  in with  giv and  fabi and  killed  the whole  front including a Rock golem thne when  they camped we continued to hunt there mezzing and clearing  the  place  with  only one  death. 2 of  those  times  we had 4  critters  on  us and still managed  to  pull  a victory outa the battle) Oh sorry there were two deaths the second one was artak on a  bad  pull  and pop the i convinced him  to  do  erk(&gt;<br>All  in  all hunting there at a 40  level  age isnt bad  exp  at  all as long as  you got a tank a healer a mezzer and  a crew  that works  well).<br>Prolly  going back  in  tonight)<br>Lessons<br>Dont  let  feeling  bad  a  bout a  problem distract you from finding  a  solution.<br>Monks and mezzers really help with multi situations  <br>if yer gonna have a tank the is a lowest level in the group at least give the poor lad sow to get a running chance.<br>I still can kill  reds and yellows) (with help)<br>DONT SIT AT FRONT OF THE HALLWAY ENT IN THE HOLE! (unless you like wiping yer group and having to zone)<br>Shouting train in chat (or group)might save yer friends from zoneing into instant  death<br><br>Well thaaaatz allll fooolks<br>Cya on the EQ side) gh gl and question always the limitations of a situation<br><br>&nbsp;<br>dungeon/quest/mob that is listed as five levels higher than mine own Thinking) .....

Katz fell aslep on  us and i ported him out and then went back to the end (apropriate name) to help the group try again. peeps died the rest barely zoned out in time. Finally outa sheer desparation i decided to summon katz back from the world of to help the group and woke up the next morning with keyboard face meself in MistyThicket i guess i must cast some ancient wizard spell to get there. anyways gotta go back some time to whoop up on them.<br> And finally  the reason for the post after  the crew and i Followed fabi around and tryn ter do the rallic pack quest and  couldnt find anything we needed for the quest. I went mondo surfing to gather the info we needed to do this quest.  Of course i got sidetracked reading about the war in hollow shade and a set of reallly keen quests in grimling forest for the vahshir the end up giving you sdome neat loot and a key to castle in acrylia. Well mosta the quests had a suggested level above my own and since i feel most peeps that put quests in Allakhazam tend error on the upperr reccommended level/ size of group side i felt we  could do them.<br> Me/sondilla/kelvena/torad/fazyen/katzeye rode the bus to the  moon ran thro shadowpaludalhollowshade to grim and then sold and geared up for the first quest which had a suggested level of 6 peeps 35 to 40 ( we  all  beat  that  so should be ez as heck). I explained  the  quest  gave thhe acrylia to Husman  the vahsir scout. We then followed him to  the Grimling village we all attacked protected him and  killed the  village. Then fought  off several waves of grimlings  ( the officer showed up inn the second  wave but it took me 4 more waves before i reallised i needed to turnin his scalp to  end the quest. All the mobs werre green as heck cept the officer. Well that quest was rather ez so. I suggested we do the next one (recomended level 10 40 somthins lol). The same sorta scenario occured we cleared then  held and held and  held and held and held it was boring nop exp no loot for hours (thanx  guys for sticking with me that was the worst camp ever). anyways in about the 14th or so wave maybe more fazyen targetted the scout by accident and his pet was almost killing it. he gated out kelvena got aggroed cause  she  healed fazyen to keep him  alive. Sondilla memblured. ANd fazzy started the  long run from sharvahl to grimling.<br>Well being as torad had to crash and sleep ealier. we  were down to me sond kel and katz and his pet and the scout now. the waves started using  more mana and we ere getting  low. plus we were still bored as hell with no danger no exp no loot. Next thing you know i am at one bub of mana medding  the next waves pops sond goes from half life to  no life kataz is fightin his arse of kel is healing like crazy and  this blue officer is beating  the crap  outa us. I nuke him dead use my last mana to help clear the rest and then start medding.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Kaesora such a lovely spooky place)!. After it killed me in my Loc plz post and almost killed me and kelvena on&nbsp;&nbsp;a scouting mission, I had to go back. I was helping Lumien quest some ancient coins in kunark for some bardy quest we first went ter Dalnir (another spooky place) we didnt have toom any probs getting his coin outa therre since evrythinng was alive and didnt see us invising around. We then went to Kaesora for his next coin and some exp wherre i found that bardlulsong is great for avoiding encounters you can walk past them and they are Soo sads they dont even care). Anyways we killed and lulled deep into Kaesora heading towards the library to get his last coin. on the steps of the library i stood smiling waiting for him to come out and bring a couple of mobs (including his cryptreaver) with him. I got a sudden shock as he came out with a crowd of adds i tried to evac but he died just as i started to finish casting and they whomped me as well. then we had fun cring our bodies with a naked bard and wiz hehe. Well I ended up staying in Kaesora for several days.Kelvena also got slightly lost when i took the rest of the group elsewhere without really informing her and died then i died cring her corpse when a live ravener saw me and (us being the only evacers which you really need ter leave Kaesora) thus led to a painful cr and a annoying recovery of the tank. Someday later we finally get a full group together. Me (suicidal nutcase wiz) Fazyen (Master of pet related group suicide) sondilla...(er skip[ that this night she was wisely pling her rogue shandil) Artak (My favorite pulling cannonfodder singer of sick songs) Llumien (cheerful bard upbeat with quik sword song and feet) Lodbob (a necro from the guild who joined us that night) and Kelvena ( an Optimistic druid that unbeknownst to her had just entered a dimension we call the hEiSzOnE (soundeffects)), also one of me fav healers buffers and dealers of sowdamageetc hehe . We move down west of the the zone ent clearing spectral guardians lizskelmonks and other unded. oops backtrack before we got a full group me artak and kelvena were pulling odds and ends and artak had a bad pull thinking fast i nuked the one that aggroed on me and finally after being interrupted several times cast evac.....er gate noooooo(. Leaving my companions to die(/grovel. I went down and cred immmediately before respawn feeling incredibly stupid(hmm hope its not genetics). this was obviously forshadowing to the rest of the night. flashforward So we move forward clearing the first rooms. Artak pulls re have a wander attack while he is pulling suddenly the necro is dead Artak then drops and the rest of the group minus llumien follows suit.(llumien hadnt showed yet) lucky dog. We re cover bodies while fightin in a hot zone and then try to figger out how we got killed?. hmm evryone is talkn bout some named fearing them. Kel checks tracking and lo and behold therre is a named Reaverr of xalgoz near by hmm i check muse map hey he is in the room artak pulled. We gear up buff up and get ready to show this ghostly dork some manners when llumien shows up (/cheer). We move down pulling unded one by one till therre is only the reaver and one friend. Artak pulls and we give him a old fashioned welcome into the netherrealms while putting numerous feet into his nether region). He drops nada (note to reader if i dont mention any loot thats cause there wasnt any loot)). We move on to the library clearing all kindsa unded with one or two drops of interest(grats Llumien) that is the funny part a nodrop stats raising shoulderslot and llum and artak discussing who should get it tho both of them are trying to be genrous to the other). We move on killing names and non in the hut and elsewhere moving back towards the frenzied area Got some cool screen shots of us by the librarby with broketail the lizard statue. <br>Lol sometime round then Artak starts doing his joe peshi goodfellas imppression in response to lodbob saying we are fun spooking him lol. So we now have spotted Xalgoz on track (/drool) he is the master of the whole area hey we gotta try to kill him). Kel starts buffing evry9onne in preparationn for magic spells and poison etc. getting antsy and figgering we will be fine pulling the three little spiders in frenzied, i urge artak to get them hmmm 4 show up(. Suddenly they decide the healing no mana druid should be lunch nothin we can do they take her down to a bub and all of them get a piece before we can kill them all (overconned suckers). I start bandaging llumien who is below a bub and is poisoned rather nicely fazzyen joins in. I then feeling guilty go forth and get naked kelvena( you would think getting a naked female woodelf wouldnt involve guilt?). We trudge on killing spiders and wormtaiiled raveners going deeper into the ground towards Xalgoz. We itued and eyeof Zommed the whole area and after careful discussion pulled the area around the church pice by piece. Then we cleared the outside and the front area of the church. It was then that i looked outside and realised that sun was showing /gasp. We buffed up and armored pulled xalgoz and company to the front of the church to battle. We killed him (he dropped only the fangs artak toook one i took the other for the future charaisis key). /cheer /sleepdeprived smiles We took screen shots in the Xalgoz church hottub er podium (hey it looks like a hottub). Being sleepy we hung areound insid the church and pulled into it (note to self when therre is a place with seven or so spawns dont stay therre and make friendlies). We died when they respawned and we had pulled 5 or so more. loding plzwaioot..... <br>Hmm naked peeps evrywhere OMG!!!( what were we (I) thinking this is the CR from heeeeeellll( and it is daylight outside. OK deeeep breath calm thoughts how are we gonna do this?. We gear up the necro trys to summon corpse (he is a yellow away from the real summon corpse) it is only good for 35 or underr hmmmm. ok we gear up and move in llumien goes ld round then ( i hope he is on tonnight i hate to leave his body sdomewherre like that(). slowly painstakely we get close enuff to make a run forr the corpses. Artak btw has switched to torad his itu casting fully armored 35resing pally to help out moreso. We pull corpses out and res them one by one. At the sazme time wandering mobs keep showing up to drain our limited mmana further. finallly in a bad situation we vac out with kelvena's corpse stilll therre un ressed and artaks corpse down there.( fazzy logs the nec logs. we move back in getting into a bad sit and vaccing out (oooh yes hehe i had evyone lev and move acroos this pit to a lower level warning them to follow me and not too fall all the way to the bottom or they would die. We got jumped on the other side, at the same time kelvena didnt make it acros the pit and started floating to the bottom and certain death) we dropped the spider and barely vacced her out in time)).So we move back in and work down to kelvena to get her ressed and to artak corpse so i can pull it to the top. moving up slowly dealioong with mobs and lds we get to the last low area before we climb outa this place and drop to the ent(yes kaesora is very confusing). /Curses Our route out is blocked by a spider and his ravener buddy. Torad pulls we fight oops make that twoo ravener buddys ...( vac out. Ok this place is pissing me off now my friends body is down there i have killed evryone (again) and it is 930 in the morning????? OMG. I have tor and kel buff me up i sow run to tors body eye of zom hmm thrre at the bottom maybe they can see invis maybe not a spider that can see invis a spectral that can and then i am home free. All i have tooo do is drag his body past the spider and ravener s around a spirally broken trail along a cliff up a broken floored tunnel past a healer spider and spec up a ramp drop down to anoth level and run out the zone home free. hmmm that is simple ). 3.. 2.. 1.. GOOOOO! i duck the spider and buddies he starts casting a root dot i resist running up the trail i juke and jump over the other spider resisting an engulfing darkness ( (hey these guys aren;t tryn terr hurt me their tryn to kill me(!!). run past the spec who macks me twice for 70 or so and get hit by another spider , resist another damned rooting dot and drop down and run out the zone /cheer touchdoown torad is loged for artak loots body me and kelvena chat for a bit it is now aftewr 1000 FYI she has been close to leveling for 4 days now has bought spells and evrything but these deaths seem to creep up on her ( I dont know why). <br>In restrospect barring our losses being targetted SO damned much on kelvena of late. we did ok <br>Lessons learned (well maybe i hope so) <br>Damned I must have some of the kindest nicest bravest friends in alla EQ i hope i dont forget that) <br>Healer aggro sucks <br>Save the healer <br>Patience is a virtue <br>Heis isnt very virtueous <br>Sleepy Peeps make Poor choices <br>Always cr those you had a hand in killing it helps you feel better sometimes sometimes it doesn't. <br>I need be more cautious... at least when my friends are close ter leveling) <br>If yer guiding the group some where and have responsibility for them dont forget it When you triumph over the villain cause him and his buddiees are coming back in 12/18/28 minutes hehe <br><br>Well good luck on yer adventures i still have a bard to cr mobs ter kill and kelvena crow pie to eat).

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Kaesora such a lovely spooky place)!. After it killed me in my Loc plz post and almost killed me and kelvena on&nbsp;&nbsp;a scouting mission, I had to go back. I was helping Lumien quest some ancient coins in kunark for some bardy quest we first went ter Dalnir (another spooky place) we didnt have toom any probs getting his coin outa therre since evrythinng was  alive and didnt see us invising around. We then went to Kaesora for his next coin and some exp wherre i found that bardlulsong is great for avoiding encounters you can walk past them and they are Soo sads they dont even care). Anyways we killed and lulled deep into Kaesora heading towards the library to get his last coin. on the steps of the library i stood smiling waiting for him to come out and bring a couple of mobs (including his cryptreaver) with him. I got a sudden shock as he came out with a crowd of adds i tried to evac but he died just as i started to finish casting and they whomped  me as well. then we had fun cring our bodies with a naked bard and wiz hehe. Well I ended up staying in Kaesora for several days.Kelvena also got slightly lost when i took the rest of the group elsewhere without really informing her and  died then i died cring her corpse when a live ravener saw me and (us being the only evacers which you really need ter leave Kaesora) thus led to a painful cr and a annoying recovery of the tank. Someday later  we finally get a full group together. Me (suicidal nutcase wiz) Fazyen (Master of pet related group suicide) sondilla...(er skip[ that this night she was wisely pling her rogue shandil) Artak (My favorite pulling cannonfodder singer of sick songs) Llumien (cheerful bard upbeat with quik sword song and feet) Lodbob (a necro from the guild who joined us that night) and Kelvena ( an Optimistic druid that unbeknownst to her had just entered a dimension we call the hEiSzOnE (soundeffects)), also one of me fav healers buffers and dealers of sowdamageetc hehe . We move down west of the the zone ent clearing spectral guardians  lizskelmonks and other unded. oops backtrack before we got a full group me artak and kelvena were pulling odds and ends and artak had a bad pull thinking fast i nuked the one that aggroed on me and finally after being  interrupted several times cast evac.....er gate noooooo(. Leaving my companions to die(/grovel. I went down and cred immmediately before respawn feeling incredibly stupid(hmm hope its not genetics).  this was obviously forshadowing to the rest of the night. flashforward So we move forward clearing the first rooms. Artak pulls re have a wander attack while he is pulling suddenly the necro is dead Artak then drops and the rest of the group minus llumien follows suit.(llumien hadnt  showed yet) lucky dog. We re cover bodies while fightin in a hot zone and then try to figger out how we got killed?. hmm evryone is talkn bout some named fearing them. Kel checks  tracking and lo and behold therre is a named Reaverr of xalgoz near by hmm i check muse map hey he is in the room artak pulled. We gear up buff up and get ready to show this ghostly dork some manners when llumien shows up (/cheer). We move down pulling unded one by one till therre is only the reaver and one friend. Artak pulls and we give him a old fashioned  welcome into the netherrealms while putting numerous feet into his nether region). He drops nada (note to reader if i dont mention any loot thats cause there wasnt any loot)). We move on to the library clearing all kindsa unded with one or two drops of interest(grats Llumien) that is the funny part a nodrop stats raising shoulderslot and llum and artak discussing who should get it tho both of them are trying to be genrous to the other). We move on killing names and non in the hut and elsewhere moving back towards the frenzied area Got some cool screen shots of us by the librarby with broketail the lizard statue.<br>Lol sometime round then Artak starts doing his joe peshi goodfellas imppression in response to lodbob saying we are fun spooking him lol. So we  now have spotted Xalgoz on track (/drool) he is the master of the whole area hey we gotta try to kill him). Kel starts buffing evry9onne in preparationn for magic spells and poison  etc. getting antsy and figgering we will be fine pulling the three little spiders in frenzied, i urge artak to  get them hmmm 4 show up(. Suddenly they decide the healing no mana druid should be lunch nothin we can do they take her down to a bub and all of them get a piece before we can kill them all (overconned suckers). I  start bandaging llumien who is below a bub and is poisoned rather nicely fazzyen joins in. I then feeling guilty go forth and get naked kelvena( you would think getting a naked female woodelf wouldnt involve guilt?). We trudge on killing spiders and wormtaiiled raveners going deeper into the ground towards Xalgoz. We itued and eyeof Zommed the whole area and after careful discussion pulled the area around the church pice by piece. Then we cleared the outside and the front area of the church. It was then that i looked outside and realised that sun was showing /gasp. We buffed up and armored pulled xalgoz and company to the front of the church to battle. We killed him (he dropped only the fangs artak toook one i took the other for the future charaisis key). /cheer /sleepdeprived smiles We took screen shots in the Xalgoz church hottub er podium (hey it looks like a hottub). Being sleepy we hung areound insid the church and pulled into it (note to self when therre is a place with seven or so spawns dont stay therre and make friendlies). We died when they respawned and we had pulled 5 or so more. loding plzwaioot.....<br> Hmm  naked peeps evrywhere OMG!!!( what were we (I) thinking this is the CR from heeeeeellll( and it is daylight outside. OK deeeep breath calm thoughts how are we gonna do this?. We gear up the necro trys to summon corpse (he is a yellow away from the real summon corpse) it is only good for 35 or underr hmmmm. ok we gear up and move in llumien goes ld round then ( i hope he is on tonnight i hate to leave his body sdomewherre like that(). slowly painstakely we get close enuff to make a run forr the corpses. Artak btw has switched to torad his itu casting fully armored 35resing pally to help out moreso. We pull corpses out and res them one by one. At the sazme time wandering mobs keep showing up to drain our limited mmana further. finallly in a bad situation we vac out with kelvena's corpse stilll therre un ressed and artaks corpse down there.( fazzy logs the nec logs. we move back in getting into a bad sit and vaccing out (oooh yes  hehe i had evyone lev and move acroos this pit to a lower level warning them to follow me and not too fall all the way to the bottom or they would die. We got jumped on the other side, at the same time kelvena didnt make it acros the pit and started floating to the bottom and certain death) we dropped the spider and barely vacced her out in time)).So we move back in and work down to kelvena to get her ressed and to artak corpse so i can pull it to the top. moving  up slowly dealioong with mobs and lds we get to the last low area before we climb outa this place and drop  to the ent(yes kaesora is very confusing). /Curses Our route out is blocked by a spider and his ravener buddy. Torad pulls we fight oops make that twoo ravener buddys ...( vac out. Ok this place is pissing me off now my friends body is down there i have killed evryone (again) and it is 930 in the morning????? OMG.  I have tor and kel buff me up i sow run to tors body eye of zom hmm thrre at the bottom maybe they can see invis maybe not a spider that can see invis a spectral that can and then i am home free. All i have tooo do is  drag his body past the spider and ravener s around a spirally broken trail along a cliff up a broken floored tunnel past a healer spider and spec up a ramp drop  down to anoth level and run out the zone home free.  hmmm that is simple ). 3.. 2.. 1.. GOOOOO! i duck the spider and buddies  he starts casting a root dot i resist running up the trail i juke and jump over the other spider resisting an engulfing darkness ( (hey these guys aren;t tryn terr hurt me their tryn to kill me(!!). run past the spec who macks me twice for 70 or so and get hit by another spider , resist another damned rooting dot and drop down and run out the zone /cheer touchdoown torad is loged for artak loots body me and kelvena chat for a bit it is now aftewr 1000 FYI she has been close to leveling for 4 days now has bought spells and evrything but these deaths seem to creep up on her ( I dont know why).<br>In restrospect barring our losses being targetted SO damned much on kelvena of late. we did ok<br>Lessons learned (well maybe i hope so)<br>Damned I must have some of the kindest nicest bravest friends in alla EQ i hope i dont forget that)<br>Healer aggro sucks <br>Save the healer<br>Patience is a virtue<br>Heis isnt very virtueous<br>Sleepy Peeps make Poor choices<br>Always cr those you had a hand in killing it helps you feel better sometimes sometimes it doesn't.<br>I need be more cautious... at least when my friends are close ter leveling)<br>If yer guiding the group some where and have responsibility for them dont forget it When you triumph over the villain cause him and his buddiees are coming back in 12/18/28 minutes hehe<br><br>Well good luck on yer adventures i still have a bard to cr mobs ter kill and kelvena crow pie to eat).
