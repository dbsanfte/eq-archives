	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greeting all.<br><br>Hope you have a great weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the next installment.  As always...comment, comment, comment.  Feedback, both good and bad is accepted gladly.<br><br>Part 22.<br><br>The sounds of anger awoke me from a painful and uncomfortable sleep.  I awoke sitting against a rock with the smell of burnt flesh in my nostrils.  From the pain I was feeling, I could only assume it was my own. I opened my eyes to see the dark elf thief and an elvish female talking animatedly a ways from where I sat.  <br><br>Softskins confuse me.  Both seemed to be adamant about their position and wanted the other to understand their position.  Both seemed to think that they had information the other needed, but both were talking at the same time without listen to the other.  I don't understand exactly how the conversation came to a conclusion, but something must have been decided because suddenly the thief drew a dagger from her boot and with a single fluid motion hurled it at me.  It missed, striking the boulder, which I had my back against.  Her brow furrowed in slight confusion.  She pulled another dagger from her belt and carefully took aim and again threw the dagger at my heart.  It also missed, sailing over the boulder into the grass of the Overthere.<br><br>I must have smiled.  Iksars rarely smile.  And when we do, softskins usually can't tell simply because it is not obvious.  Our facial features are simply not as pliable as those who do not have scales.  However, it must have been clear enough, because I was amused as I watched the dagger go over my head and then looked full into the dark elf's eyes.   She stared at me and must have caught a hint of that amusement.  She reached down to her scabbard with a yell of frustration.  I sat perfectly still as she rushed me with her blade drawn.  The sword came down with speed and precision: Its purpose to end my life.  The sword also missed and struck the stone between my head and shoulder.  Our faces were mere inches apart.  The aura of hate coming from the dark elf as palatable as rain coming down from the sky.   The thief opened her eyes and looked into mine.  &quot;What have you done to me, lizard?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pick up your daggers, elf.&quot;  Her face clouded over for a moment as she stood up and picked up the dagger that was lying next to me and then proceeded around the rock to find the dagger that was in the grass beyond.  <br><br>I stood up and bowed.  Standing before me was a very angry Elf.  Not as violent or sporadic as the dark elf that searched the grass, but the type of controlled anger which stood before me was much more dangerous.  This elf was a druid if the legends held true.  I knew nothing of what powers druids possessed, but I knew that this druid was a person of power beyond myself.  In common trade language I spoke  &quot;My name is Shrikke.  Shadow Knight of the Greenmist.  Son of Rile.  What do you wish of me, my lady?&quot;<br><br>She returned a slight bow.  &quot;My name is Chakarra, Druid of Tunare. What have you done to my sister, Knight?&quot; Her eyes narrowed as she spoke.  <br><br>I shrugged my shoulder, &quot;It is called the Mark of Kzallon.  It stops a slave from harming its master and allows the master to control the actions of the slave if he wishes.&quot; I turned slightly and spoke over my shoulder to the dark elf.  &quot;The dagger is by your left boot.&quot;  One of the druid's eyebrows lifted slightly. I turned back to her. &quot;It also allows the master to see through the eyes of the slave.  It is very useful.&quot;<br><br>The dark elf came walking up smiling, &quot;I found them.&quot;  Then an odd look came over the dark elf's face.  She turned upon me, &quot;Bastard.  How did you make me do that and stop me from killing you?  Tell me or I will...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Synnful you can not do anything at the moment.&quot; the druid interrupted, &quot;Please be calm.  Shrikke, release my sister from this mark or I will have to kill you.&quot;<br><br>I shook my head, &quot;That I can not do at the present time.  I have need of her.  I will release her when that need has been filled. Not before.&quot;  I continued, &quot;You may kill me if you like, it is certainly easy enough for someone of your power, but that may not be the best course of action as far as your sister is concerned.  This mark is especially tuned so that any Iksar can sense it.   If I do not cancel it any Iksar could, in theory, take control of the mark and your sister in the process.  I'm not sure you want to put your sister in that position...do you?&quot;  A scream erupted from the dark elf and what I can only assume was a long string of profanity.  She started yelling at her sister in elvish again and pointing at me with a dagger that she was holding.  I looked at her.  &quot;Synnful, sit down and be quiet.&quot;  Immediately, the thief sat down and stopped talking.<br><br>Chakarra almost smiled I think.  &quot;I can see where this mark has its uses.  However, I cannot have my sister placed in this position over the long term.  I'm guessing that the mark can be undone by someone other than yourself, given enough time.&quot;<br><br>I nodded.  &quot;That may be true enough.  However, are you willing to place your sister at risk of being drawn under the influence of one of my kind until you figure out exactly how to do that?  Concurrently, I doubt that your sister would be willing to stay in a temple surrounded by clerics until the mark can be removed in any case.&quot;<br><br>The druid folder her arms over her chest, &quot;Then what exactly do you suggest we do, Shrikke, Knight of Fear?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suggest that you let me use this one to search out a path to the barge that docks in the Outpost.   It is not dangerous for one of her kind.  I do not need her to do anything more than be my eyes so that I can get out of this land and get to land of Velious.  It is simple enough.&quot;<br><br>I was surprised when the Druid laughed.  &quot;Is that all seek, Iksar?  I forget that your kind does not practice any type of magic except for necromancy.&quot;  I did not correct her.  The Shaman would take some offence at her statement.   I let it pass.  &quot;I will take you to the land of ice and snow without having to travel by boat if you then release my sister from your control.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You can do that?&quot; I asked in surprise.<br><br>&quot;I can Shadow Knight and I will, if you agree upon your honor to do what I ask of you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agreed.  I will release your sister from my control once I get to Velious with the condition that neither of you will try to retaliate once I have released her.   Is that acceptable?&quot;<br><br>The Druid nodded, &quot;That is acceptable.&quot;<br><br>I pointed at the dark elf sitting quietly on the ground. &quot;Do you speak for her?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I do.  She will not seek revenge once you have released her from your control.  Although, I doubt she will be happy about it.&quot;  Chakarra looked down at her sister.  &quot;I doubt she will be happy at all.&quot;<br><br>I turned to pick up my backpack.  It was at that moment, and for the second time in my life that I saw a corpse disappear.   The air around the dark elf Shadow Knight's body suddenly began to glow and his body disappeared.  I turned back to the Druid.  &quot;Did you see that?  I think it is time to leave this place.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agreed, Iksar.  There is a necromancer in the area and I can only assume he is not alone.&quot;<br><br>As I gathered up my belongings I inquired of the druid, &quot;Are you saying that a necromancer can summon a corpse to him?  I did not know it was possible.&quot;<br><br>The druid smiled.  &quot;Many things are possible, Shrikke.  I think it is a good time for you to get off of Kunark and see the rest of the world.  Whether you believe it or not, the world does not circle the Empire of the Iksar, no matter what your people think.&quot;<br><br>I finished placing my pack on my back and nodded at the Druid that I was ready to leave.  I turned to ask the thief to join us when the sound of powerful magic filled the air and there was a scream from the Druid.  I pulled my sword and turned in the direction of where I thought the magic had come.  I expected to see a necromancer with a pet at his side.  Instead, I saw a dark elf in robes holding a book with one hand and a staff in the other.  The staff glowed for a moment and a blue stream of ice streaked from the end and slammed again into the druid.   I could see her skin cover in ice and freeze over as she dropped to the ground.  He must have been invisible for him to be so close without the druid or I noticing.<br><br>I charged with my Dark Reaver, knowing that I would not get to him before the next spell.  I was correct.  This spell was not like the stream of ice, but a bolt of fire that exploded at it hit my breastplate.  I was lifted in the air and for the second time that day impacted with a particular rock.<br><br>I lost conciseness as I struck my head.<br><br>The sound of laugher woke me up.  I was very hurt.  I could not move.  Something was seriously damaged.  I could not feel my tail or my legs.  I raised my head slightly and saw the dark elf standing over the body of the druid.  He was the source of the laughter.<br><br>&quot;Foolish druid.  Did you think you could interfere with the business of the Ebon Masks?&quot;  The druid was not moving, but I could see that her chest was moving slightly.  She was not dead, yet.  He turned to me.  &quot;Ah...Iksar, you are not dead?  I have heard that your kind has some amazing regenerative powers.&quot;  I tried to speak, but could not.  The dark elf smiled.  &quot;I am glad you are not dead.  I have a question about what you have done to this one.&quot;  He pointed at Synnful still quietly sitting on the ground.  She had not moved during the whole attack.  &quot;What have you done to her to make her so...obedient?&quot;<br><br>I managed to croak a response very quietly that suggested that the magic user do something to a froglok that is anatomically impossible.<br><br>He took a quick step toward me and struck me with his staff.  The swing had no power behind it, he was a magic user, but in the condition I was in, it caused me to black out for a moment.  I regained my sensed and open my eyes.  He stood next to me.  &quot;Tell me.  Tell me now or I will give you to the necromancer as food for the ghouls.&quot;<br><br>I nodded in what I hoped he took as surrender and painfully beaconed him to move closer.  &quot;It is a simple thing, elf.  As simple as the words &quot;Please join us, Synnful&quot;. <br><br>The dark elf magic user face looked confused for a moment then angry.  &quot;What does that mean, lizard?&quot;<br><br>Maybe he would have asked me more, but the dagger that suddenly materialized through his chest made it difficult to speak.  I heard the sucking sound of the dagger pulled back through the wound and the magic user's body fell to the side.  Behind him stood Synnful with a dagger and a very odd smile.  &quot;Stupid.&quot;  She stated. &quot;Never completely ignore the thief.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thief,&quot; I panted threw the pain, &quot;In my pack is a large spider web wrapped in cloth.  Take it out an put it on the Druid's chest.&quot;<br><br>The thief rummaged through the pack and found the web and placed it on the druids still form.  A glow came from the straithbone spider web as it melted into the druid's body warming her and healing her.  She suddenly opened her eyes and sat up and saw the dead magic user on the ground.  She opened her mouth to speak, but I interrupted her.  &quot;We need to leave.  If you have some way to make us leave this place quickly, please feel free.&quot;<br><br>She stood up and walked over to me.  Then standing next to my broken body, she spoke words of power and I felt the rush of healing magic repair my damaged limbs.  Feeling came back to my legs and tail.  I stood up and again bowed to this druid.  She spoke once more and in a sudden jerk that could be seen, but not felt,  the earth moved.  When it stopped, I felt snow under my boots.  I looked around and saw a ring of stones with a stone dragon guarding the top.  Steep mountains covered with snow could be seen in every direction.  This was not Kunark anymore.  <br><br>Chakarra turned around and must have sensed my wonderment because she smiled even though her lips were still blue from the attack.  Synnful stood behind me and I heard her in a whisper that had an edge of menace, &quot;Welcome to the Great Divide, Shrikke.&quot;<br><br>Good hunting all.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Aug  9 19:14:10 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I got inspired by someone asking when the next installment was coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much for the input and support of this story.  Please continue to feel free to comment whether good or bad.<br><br>This one is a little bloodier...hope that is okay :-)<br><br>Part 21.<br><br>Slavery is a practice I understand.  A creature that is incapable of contributing to society must be forced under the watchful eye of that society to become useful without draining too many resources.  At any point, if a slave is incapable or simply ceases to produce more than it consumes, the slave is killed.  This isn't a type of punishment.  It is simply a result of a predetermined equation.  No malice or hatred is felt toward a slave that fails its master.  Do you get angry at a hammer or a chisel that breaks while you are using it?  Certainly not, but do you keep a tool that cannot perform the function for which it was made?  <br><br>This idea is followed in the Iksar system of justice as well.  When an Iksar is found to have broken a tenant of our society, they are brought before a council of elders and judged.  However, unlike the softskins who judge the members of their society on the offender's past deeds, the Iksar judge on whether a being is likely to be of use to the society in the future.  Again, good and evil have very little meaning to an Iksars.  The real question is can you prove yourself useful to the Iksar race in the future?  Will you produce for our society more than you consume?  If the answer is no, then there is only one punishment:  death.  Again, this conclusion is made without hatred or malice, just a decision based on economics.<br><br>As I followed the two dark elves, I could tell by the interchange between them that the one in chains was a prisoner and not used to being bound.  I did not understand their language for they spoke in the tongue of the Tier'Dal, but by the tone of voice and the look of hatred that came from the female, the chains were the only things that kept her from attempting to rip out the heart of her capture.  Definitely not one used to being a slave, she was a prisoner.<br><br>Klok G'Rshai had been correct in assessment of the female's captor, he was a Shadow Knight like myself and well equipped.  But he lacked my power and experience.  Because of his path, I would try to reason with the elf.  Probably a hopeless gesture, considering the reputation of the Tier'Dal.  However, there is a bond between all we knights of shadow that should not be ignored.  I would give him the benefit of the doubt and try to make him see that my need for the slave was greater than his.  Or I would kill him.  The female was an excellent tool to escape this continent of Kunark.<br><br>The two dark elves where not moving quickly.  I easily moved into the path ahead of them and quietly drew my sword.  As they came within a swords length, I dismissed the shadows that surrounded me.  To the credit of the dark elf Shadow Knight, he did not flitch as a long black sword materialized between the top of his armor and his chin.  He simply stopped.  As we looked into each other's eyes across the length, the point of the sword a hairs breath from his exposed throat, I did not see fear as I expected.  No, where I expected to see fear in the eyes of this soft skin, I saw hate.<br><br>Slowly, in the language of common trade, I spoke.  &quot;Give me the slave, knight.  I have need of her.&quot;  The dark elf's hand twitched involuntarily toward the sword he wore on his hip but otherwise did not move.<br><br>&quot;She is not mine to give, lizard,&quot; he replied.   His eyes narrowed briefly as he continued, &quot;She is to be taken to the leader of her guild, Eolom J'Axx of the Ebon Masks, for questioning.  He is a powerful man whose reach extends even to this dragon-scorched land.  If you leave me to my task without further interruptions, he may not hunt you down and de-scale you like a carp,&quot; he smirked.<br><br>My blade moved forward slightly.  The point of the sword touched his throat with just enough pressure to draw blood.  He winced, but again did not give into the fear I thought would show on his face.  I shook my head slowly.  &quot;Do you know, elf, that I learn something every time I speak with a soft skin?  Would you like to know what I learned today?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I do not...&quot;  The sentence was interrupted by my blade passing through his windpipe and then between two of the vertebra at the base of his skull.  As blood flowed down the blade of my weapon and the stolen strength of this foolish dark elf became part of my own, his lifeless body hit the ground.  I pulled my weapon free and looked at the length of chain that held the female elf.  Now, instead of the thief, there where two empty cuffs.<br><br>Thieves are an interesting group.  Outside of the outcast bandits, I have never dealt with them before simply because the Iksar do not allow members of its culture to be parasites.   Those who live on the scraps of others do not contribute to the whole of society in any meaningful way and must not be allowed to prosper.  However, just because I have never dealt with thieves does not mean that I do not know what they are capable of doing.  The thief had picked the locks and had hidden in the tall grass in an effort to escape.   Even as I gazed over the grassy landscape, I knew I had little chance of finding her once she was hidden.  I calmly reached into the pouch at my belt, pulled out a handful of bone chips and threw them to the ground.  Then drawing upon the lines of magic, I gave power to those bone chips.  Out of that power, a large skeleton rose from the ground and spoke &quot;I am Jober.  How may I serve you, Master?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Find the dark elf thief and bring her back to this spot.&quot;  I have said it before, the undead have an uncanny sense of the living.  The skeleton turned slowly around, and then suddenly lurched off into the grass.  Predictably, as the skeleton entered an area of tall grass the thief stood up and made a run for the gates of the outpost.  As she sprinted away with my pet following closely behind her, I again reached for power and cast a spell of engulfing darkness around her to slow her and make sure she did not make it to those gates.  I turned back to the dead Shadow Knight, quickly rummaged through his pack and found what must have been the thief's weapons and armor.<br><br>I turned to watch as my pet was coming back to me with the thief in tow, both much the worst for wear.  Several ribs where cracked and one arm was completely gone from my faithful pet and the thief was unconscious and bleeding from a number of locations.  &quot;Put her down there, Jober, and please leave us alone.&quot;  As he placed her on the ground, I let the magic that held my pet together disappear in a tumble of bone dust and turned to the female.<br><br>I needed her to scout me a path to the barge that docked at the outpost and would take me ultimately to Velious.  But I could not trust her not to give me away to the guards that warded the boat.  I had to make her more than a slave of the flesh; I needed to use her eyes and mind.   As she lay on the ground, her face to the sky, I took the Dark Reaver once again, and plunged the blade through the shoulder of the dark elf thief into the ground.   She woke up screaming, but not in pain.  A cry of hatred passed over her lips and pierced the Overthere.  I assume she was swearing at me in her own language as she reached over with the arm that was not pinned to the earth and tried to pull the blade out of her shoulder, but I knew that the Reaver would leach the strength from her and make it impossible for her to move.  I again give the dark elf a bit of my own health to stop the pool of blood that was forming on the ground underneath her and took out a small sharp dagger. <br><br>The dark elf's eyes grew large as I grabbed the arm that was pinned to the ground.  She again screamed hatred at me as I began to slowly make a cut down the length of the arm.  She tried to move, but the Reaver continued to draw her strength.  It did not take me long to get to the bone underneath the dark skin. She screamed and swore as I carefully carved my name into the bone of her arm with a symbol of bonding.  I expected her to pass out sometime during the procedure, but alas she did not.  However, as I continued to carve she became quieter.  I finished the ceremony and again passed enough of my own health to her to heal the wound I had made in her arm.<br><br>I looked over at her face for the first time since I began the bonding and instead of pain or agony, I saw hatred and determination.  I put my foot on her arm and pulled the sword out of her shoulder.  She neither grunted nor moved and I again passed my own strength to her to heal her shoulder.<br><br>I sat down across from her.  &quot;What is your name, slave?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am Synnful Rash'Ghule.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do you know my name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, you are Shrikke, Crusader of the Greenmist.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Correct.  I need to do something for me, and then I will release you.  Do you understand?&quot;<br><br>Synnful sat up and bowed her head.  &quot;You have a need for me, then you say you will let me go. I understand.&quot; She then looked up at me, her dark hair over shadowing here purple eyes.  &quot;I understand completely, but the question is will my sister understand?&quot;<br><br>At that moment, I hear the cry of a wolf and my world exploded in a fire of stars.<br><br>Thanks again...the next chapter has already been started :-)<br><br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jul 22 22:44:21 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is not the most exciting story I have written to date, but I promise the next installment will be more interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, please comment either pro or con.  I enjoy the feedback and actually appriciate the constructive critism type.<br><br>Part 20.<br><br>As the sun rose over the plains of The Overthere, I cursed at myself for being caught sleeping and quickly reached for my weapon while trying to locate the person behind the voice.  It was not hard to find the source.  Standing in front of me, with her hand on her hips and a terse frown, stood another Iksar.  &quot;Such language, broodling.  But from the look of you, I would say that you have had a difficult evening.&quot;  <br><br>Eventually, I managed to stand.  Pieces of mud and grass fell off my armor onto the ground as I straightened up.  &quot;My apologies if I have offended.  I was surprised to met anyone out in these wilds.&quot;  My sword moved ever so slightly to the ready.<br><br>The other Iksar's eyes did not miss the movement.  The frown turned into a slight smile.  &quot;You have nothing to fear from me, honorable knight, unless you fear a meal and chance to rid yourself of the mud you collected from the waterhole, yesterday.&quot;   I frowned at the reminder of the previous day's activities but bowed my head in thanks and followed the other Iksar to her camp.  She asked me the story behind my muddy appearance as we walked and I told her the story of my race with the Sarnaks.  &quot;You are lucky.  The knights of the Sarnaks are powerful in their own right.  I am surprised you did not end up as a trophy in their fort.&quot;<br><br>I nodded my head in agreement.  &quot;I was taught to not take any foe lightly.  I will not misjudge the resourcefulness of the Sarnaks again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye, Knight.  That is a good plan, if you wish to continue to breath.&quot;<br><br>We continued our trek.  &quot;I have not introduced myself.  I am...&quot;<br><br>Waving a hand in the air, &quot;You are Shrikke, Shadowknight of Fear, fleeing from the wrath of the cursed Necromancers.  On your way to Velious, if I have heard correctly.&quot;  I opened my mouth to respond, but she continued.  &quot;I was told to look out for you by a mutual friend.  I, by the way, am Klok G'Rshai.  I handle all Iksar commerce in the Overthere, with the Haggle Baron's blessing.&quot;  She stopped and turned to look at me.  &quot;And I am at anyone's service who has enough coin to buy my wares or working toward the good of the Empire.&quot;  She turned back around and continued to walk. <br><br>We continued on for a while and soon came to the edge of the ocean.  Upon the shore was her campsite.  A large tent and a well-used fire pit showed that this had been Klok G'Rshai's home for quite a while.   She started preparing food while I jumped into the ocean with my armor still on to wash away the previous day's adventure.  As I came out of the waves, clean and refreshed, the smell of warm food filled my lungs as I walked back to the camp.  I sat down, grabbed a rag and started wiping down my armor.<br><br>G'Rshai handed me a bowl of steaming broth and sat down across the fire from me.  I thanked her with a nod of my head.  &quot;You don't talk much, knight.&quot; <br><br> It was my turn to smile.  &quot;I have been thinking on a few questions, good Klok.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What questions are those?&quot;<br><br>&quot;First, to whom do you sell your wares?  There are only Dark Elves and Sarnaks in this part of the Kunark.  You must not do much business unless you have an agreement with them and of course, the Haggle Baron would only have you out here if you could turn a profit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know the Haggle Baron well, I think,&quot; she replied.  &quot;Continue, please.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Second, you do not have a lot of supplies laying around and the tent is large, but not large enough to store a great amount of inventory.  You must deal in items that are less substantial than food and water.  I am I correct?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, that is a good assessment for the most part.  Information is truly my main commodity.  The Haggle Baron is not interested in politics unless it interferes with profit.  So, I sell the information I can to whoever has the coin to spend.  The Sarnaks and the Dark Elves, Trolls and Ogres all know that I am a reliable resource and allow me to continue to do business as I see fit.&quot;<br><br>Nodding my head, &quot;I understand.&quot;<br><br>The rest of the meal continued in silence.  Afterwards, I cleaned my bowl and started to re-pack my equipment.  I soon noticed my backpack was missing.  I quickly scanned the camp and was about to become concerned when G'Rshai came out of her tent holding a strange looking bag.  &quot;You are looking for your things?&quot; she stated.  &quot;I have packed them in this.&quot;  I took the bag from her and noticed that it was much lighter than I would have expected.  Upon closer inspection, I could tell the material it was made of was magical in nature.  &quot;It is a bag made of the skins of the Evil Eyes that reside in the bowels of the Froglok stronghold.  It floats as the Eyes themselves float, making caring the bag much easier than a normal backpack.&quot;<br><br>I bowed, &quot;This is very generous.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is nothing.  The Dark Elf who traded it to me was starving.  I made a good profit from him.&quot;  I put on the rest of my armor and thanked the Klok for her help.  &quot;You are welcome, Shrikke.  Before you leave, could I ask you a couple of questions?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will answer if I can.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You have seen the Vampire in the Tower of Necromancy?&quot;<br><br>I stiffed slightly wondering where this was going.  &quot;Yes, I have seen him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can you describe him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I could, but it would be from my own perspective and I doubt you would be able to deduct who he was before death.&quot;  I strapped my sword to my side, &quot;However, I could give you a name if you like.&quot;<br><br>Her breath caught, &quot;You know his name?  How?&quot;<br><br>I smiled, &quot;Because I was there when he failed the Test.  His name is Hapzass.  He was taken from the Test at the time of his death but I know not how.&quot;  Finishing the last buckle on my sheath.  &quot;Now you know his name as well.&quot;  I looked up and the Klok was not smiling.  &quot;I hope it does you some good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is more than I had hoped.&quot;  She sat down on the log next to the fire.  &quot;Now I have some information for you.  You will need to get on the Bloated Belly at the docks of the outpost to leave this place.  The guards around the dock are a combination of dark elves and undead.  It will be difficult to board the ship without one or the other group seeing you.  However, not long ago, two dark elves passed this way.  One was a knight like you, the other a thief bound in the chains of a slave.  She was to be taken back to her homeland for some crime and did not seem pleased about the prospect of returning.  She might be made to help you board the boat, if you could...persuade...the other dark elf to release her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Which way did they go?&quot;  The Klok pointed in the direction of the outpost.   &quot;My thanks.  I will see you again, I hope.&quot;  I turned and started running to the outpost.<br><br><br>Good hunting all.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Apr  5 17:47:39 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, it may not be the most exciting story - as you say - but it is certainly intruiging (sp?).

	   <tr><td colspan=2>February and March where tough.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have finally caught up on real life to dedicate a bit more energy to the story of our growing Shadowknight.  I hope that you enjoy this next installment and as always, please don't be afraid to post comment and suggestions.  Good hunting all in the land of Norrath.<br><br>Part 19.<br> <br>As I moved out through the trees, into the pass that leads to the place know as The Overthere, my eyes and thoughts were drawn to the statue of the Iksar warrior that guards the entrance to Warslilks Woods.  It had been built at the height of our power, when the Iksars knew no enemies, only slaves.  We had ruled Kunark then with steel, claw, magic and, most importantly, order.  <br><br>Does that surprise you, the fact that order was so much a part of our society?   Of course it does.  You have listened to the stories told by others who fear us, stories that tell of my people as savage heartless creatures with no thought except destroy and enslave those around us.  Those stories misrepresent the true intent of the Iksar Empire.  Do you think that a society that was simply bent on destruction and chaos could have so completely civilized a continent?  Look at the structures that dot the landscape throughout Kunark.  Look at the roads and the waterways that tie the whole of Kunark together. Not since the Combine Empire has there been such building and architecture.  Are these the works of a people who yearned for death or for simply a better life?  Of course we enslaved the giants, goblins and the other lesser races that infested our Empire.  How could we leave these disruptive and violent creatures free, when they endangered not only themselves but also the Empire with their chaotic behavior?  Instead we used their strength and added it to our own.  Kunark was safe, clean, and orderly while we ruled.  However, we have fallen far as a people since that time.  Now the continent is in ruin and dangerous and falling victim to the forces of chaos, specifically to the elves that have invaded our shores.  Dark Elves, High Elves...it matter not to the Iksar.  Both are agents of chaos.  Dark Elves with their need to glory in death, pain and debauchery make no plans for the future except those that gratify their most basic needs, irrespective of the consequences to themselves or those in their own society.  In contrast, the High Elves have a preoccupation with allowing all beings to follow a  &quot;natural&quot; path in the name of allowing freedom.  Both paths lack purpose.  Both paths lack discipline.  Both paths eventually lead to death and chaos.   Someday, we will burn both their outposts to the ground and show them the errors of their paths.<br><br>When would that time come?  When would my race regain respect?  &quot;Questions for another time,&quot; I thought, as I stepped off the hill and made my way into the rolling, grassy plains of The Overthere.<br><br>The sun was setting as I started this part of my journey and I knew that I would need a place to rest for the night.  As the night truly began, I picked the base of a large boulder to set up camp.  I did not build a fire.  Sarnaks and the Dark Elves roamed the plains, and I did not want to give them something to investigate.  That night I was awoken by the sound of shuffling around my camp.  As I lay on the ground, I peered into the darkness, hoping to see some evidence of what was moving in the night.  And although I could hear and smell something out around my camp, yet I could see nothing.   Thinking that maybe a dark elf or other enemy had cast a spell of invisibility and was moving in to ambush me, I leaped up from my prone position and brought my sword to the ready.  The Dark Reaver, removed from its sheath began to cast an eerie glow over the area.  To my surprise, it was not an enemy or some sort of creature that had awoken me, but a plant.  I had heard of the plants in The Overthere that walked, but I had only half believed the story until this moment.   If the tales I had heard where true, the plants where dangerous only if attacked directly and tended to ignore just about everything else.  Why then, did this plant suddenly stop and turn towards me as I held my sword at the ready?  With my sword still on guard, I moved towards the creature and inspected the sharp thorns that covered its surface and still the creature did not move.  As I moved away back to the base of the rock, I could hear another plant heading directly towards my camp.  It soon joined the first in a silent watch over me.  The two plants did not move and after a while I figured it was safe enough to sleep.  I sheathed my sword and as darkness rushed into the area, I could hear the plants start shuffling away.  &quot;Why would they leave now?&quot; I wondered.  It struck me as I placed my hand on my sword.   I pulled out the burnt out lightstone that still hung around my next and held it over my head.   I brought power to the stone and a white clear light covered the area around my camp.  I could see the plants reverse their movement and come back to my camp.  &quot;They seek light,&quot; I thought.  I was amused by the behavior of these plants.  What series of events had the hated Shissar enacted to give these plants the drive to seek out light?  Within a short time, I had drawn more than twenty of the creatures to my camp, all of them standing dutifully in the light of the stone.  I soon grew bored and knew that the light would eventually draw more then these very odd plants.  I released the power to the stone and heard the plants begin to wander out onto the plains. <br><br>It was lucky, for one of the plants performed an invaluable service to me by shuffling over a large prone object in the grass and inflicted enough damage to make it yelp.  The sarnak knowing that it had given itself away, leapt to its feet and dodging the mobile plants rushed to attack me.  It was not fast enough.  I cast a spell of fear upon the charging beast and smiled as the look of excitement upon the sarnak&amp;#8217;s face changed to a look of terror.  As the beast tried to flee through the plants, it must have stuck one hard enough to anger it.  The plant instantly began whiping the sarnak with those deadly thorns.  I sat back on my rock and watched as the plant struck the fleeing beast over and over again.  With another spell, I cast a curtain of darkness and slowed the sarnak down to allow the plant plenty of opportunity to deal with this creature that had tried to ambush me.  Eventually, the sarnak worked through the terror of the fear spell and started battling the plant, but it was soon over.  The last thing the sarnak felt was me tapping its life force, then death.<br><br>Although this battle was an easy victory, I knew that I needed to leave the area quickly.  This was a young sarnak, recruited recently by its elders to the ways of battle.  One of those elders would be missing this one soon enough.  I looted the body of a few coins, gathered my pack and headed away from the stone as quickly as I could.  I walked through most of the night and eventually stopped under a lone tree on a side of a hill to sit and rest.  As the sun rose on a sleepless night, I could see in the distance running my direction a group of sarnaks.  Thinking these were foolish creatures, I cast a spell and stepped into the shadows of the plains and moved a ways away from the tree.  I would wait until they passed by and simply head in a different direction.  I knew I was in trouble when the largest of the sarnaks got to the tree I had been sitting under and sniffed around its base like a scale wolf, then pointed in my direction.<br><br>I began to run.<br><br>Staying invisible, I made my way over rocks and hills, hoping that the creatures would lose my trail.  It was by the luck of the gods that I came to the shallow, muddy pond.  I quickly ran through the watering hole and out the other side, making sure that a trail went into the high grass on the other side.  I then, carefully, retraced my steps back to the pond and allowed myself to sink into the mud at the bottom.  It was not long before I heard the sound of running sarnak feet as they ran past the pond and back into the plains.  Persistence seems to be a sarnak virtue for they came back to the pond several times that day, to try to pick up the trail.  None of them entered the mud hole except to drink.  So, it seems I spent the second day in the plains of Overthere in a mud hole only coming up for air as needed, then sinking back out of sight.<br><br>It was very dark and I had not seen any sign of the sarnaks for quite a while before I came out of that hole.  I was cold and muddy as I dragged myself and my backpack out of the slime of the pond.  Again, I could not light a fire, so I huddled against another stone and listened to the sounds of the night.  I must have finally dosed off to sleep, because I was surprised by the voice that spoke perfect Iksar.  &quot;Wake up, Knight of Shadow...your day has just begun, I think.&quot;<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Mar 29 10:46:12 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2> Hi, This is my first time posting but I have a proplem about people taking advantage of newbies with enchanted items, And now with new focus items it's worse. I once was almost in big truble because of theese focus items, Lukly I didn't pay for them if I had I would have been In HUGE trouble! you see the night after the new patch I found some packages on the ground and dicided to investigate. I picked them up and found that they were braclets and rings. Being better than my current ones I equiped them. I almost sold my previous braclets when I became link dead. When I was back on the right before I clicked the trade button I realised the rings and bracelets dissapeard. I was almost a victim of loosing soe good equip, and now newbies have been. So if your a person that can enchant theese items then make sure that you clearly state the'll disapeer after loging. Don't let newbies be the victim because you used to be just like them belive it or not.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lord Celris TreeWalker Enchanter of the World</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am sorry for the time I have not posted.  I have been in the middle of re-modeling my home and the home of my Mom and have not had much energy to write.  However, I've got another tale for you.  One that is very scary because it happened in RL.  My Mom is doing a huge (&gt;900 ft^2) re-model to her house.  The original plans (which took almost 9 months to get approval through the county office) called for the contractor to take off 2/3 off the existing roof and put in new trusses.  The front 1/3 of the roof was to be left alone.  This was signed off by the building inspectors.<br><br>So, we move forward in time to the point where the new roof has been build.  Plywood is on top of the trusses ready for the shingles.  The whole project had been inspected twice up to this point, including the 1/3 of the roof that was supposed to be left untouched.  It was at this critical point that the county inspector decided that the whole roof issue was suddenly a problem and that the whole roof needed to be removed and re-built even though it was build exactly to the plans that the county had approved.  The contractor agreed to pay for the cost of the new trusses and my Mom agreed to pay for the cost of labor.  New trusses where then designed, shipped and installed at a cost of $10,000 over the course of 3 weeks and 4 storm events.<br><br>The contractor, suggested to my Mom that she contact her insurance agent.  Sure enough, her homeowner's insurance stated that if during the replacement of a roof, if the structure was found to not meet code that the insurance company would assist with the cost of bringing the roof structure up to code.  The insurance agent simply needed a statement from the contrator and the county building inspector that the structure was not up to code.  The contractor and building inspector agreed to write such a letter and so the project has moved forward...until the phone call yesterday.<br><br>We assumed everything was fine, so my Mom was surprised when the insurance agent called her at work yesterday asking again why she had to replace her roof.  She again explained what had happened...that the building inspector had required them to replace the roof after determining that the exsisting roof was not up to specification.  The insurance agent then asked her if she was SURE that she just didn't what to update the roof...asked if maybe she was the one who asked for the contractor to replace the roof.  My Mom was confused and replied why would she ask the contractor to tear off a roof that had already been built?  The extra cost, the damage from the storm to the rest of the house...why would she have ASKED the contractor to re-build the roof?<br><br>The insurance agent agreed and explained that my Mom's story and the contractor's story matched.  However, the country building inspector's letter stated that he was not responsible for the re-building of the roof.  That my Mom and the contractor where responsible for making that decision.<br><br>My Mom, then called the contractor, who did not sound surprised in the change of story by the inspector and stated that he would talk to the inspector about re-writing the letter and for my Mom not to worry about it.<br><br>I think this is a case of local government run amok.  I understand a need for build codes and regulations.  I understand the need to enforce those codes.  Heck, I work for a state agency and am responsible for enforcing a number of regulatory issues.  However, I am responsible for the decisions I make concerning those areas.  These county building inspectors not only where incompetent concerning the approval of plans for the original re-model, but then tried to say that they were not responsible for the actions they forced.<br><br>In a country that is based on the words, &quot;Of the people, by the people and For the people&quot; it is unfortunate that petty officials try so hard to screw the people.<br><br>/Rant off<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've had this story in my head for a bit, but haven't had time to finish it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you enjoy it.  <br><br>Just to let those of you that read this journal into my RL a little bit, I am a father of two children under 3 years old, and both of them have been sick for bit.  Nothing serious, but they both have not let my wife and I sleep very much over the last couple of weeks.  So, if the story is not up to snuff, I beg your indulance :-)<br><br>As always...please comment or offer suggestion.<br><br>Part 18.<br><br>Most races, if they where honest with themselves, would agree with the statement that death is something to be feared.  However, I have found the soft skinned races truly don't fear death.  They fear the pain just before death.  The feel of a blade sliding between one's ribs or agony of a spell ending a life in a mass of fire, blood and pain, this is what most people actually fear.   What happens after death, in my experience, doesn't concern most.  Everyone understands that the body goes back into the cycle and one's essences become part of whichever god one has followed through the course of life.  This seems on the surface like a reasonable and somewhat pleasurable ending, to bask in the power and knowledge of the gods.  However, this system terrifies me.  It is not that I fear joining my lord, Cazic Thule, or fear becoming part of his will, but that I will cease to have a will of my own.  I fear that once I have died, I will never again personally affect the world.  All chances for personal improvement, power, fame and greatness will be engulfed in the overpowering presence of my god.  Because of this ending to life, I take my life seriously.  I do not spend my time in idle amusements or frivolous vices.   Let those around me play and love and waste their days.<br><br>Death comes to all, but it will not find me wishing I had not reached my potential.<br><br>I walked out of the Field of Bones into Warslilks Woods just before the sun had dropped below the horizon.  It was hard to leave my home behind.  Hard to leave my people at a time when I knew they were in danger of being overcome but the mad plans of the necromancers.  I also still felt the lost of Squire Mharkas.  She was not only the one who showed me my path, but was also the only link to by past that I knew about.  I had not had an opportunity to ask her about my parents before her execution.  I had plenty of opportunity, but never took the time.  I smiled as I saw her in my mind's eye explaining this final lesson,   &quot;Broodling, don't fail to focus on your real priorities, and certainly don't procrastinate in the implementation of those priorities.   Some opportunities only happen once in a lifetime.  Miss them and they will be your undoing.&quot;  Well, I would take this last lesson given to me by the Squire and focus on my ultimate goal:  To come back to Cabilis and bring down the power of the Brood of Kotiz.  They had held the reins of the Empire for too long and had ceased to put their own welfare above the welfare of the people.  And now, they had thrown our lot in with the Vampires.  The undead that walk the Castle of Karnor should have been enough of warning of what could happen when dealing with those who do not have life, but still live.<br><br>These images ran through my mind as I walked the shady under growth of Warslilks Woods.  However, the image of Master Xydoz slowly sliding down an impalement pole was interrupted by an all too familiar sound of breaking limbs and upturned bushes coming towards me   I came to a halt and watched as the Brute walked past me.  I could tell the beast was aware of my presents, as its sulking eyes never left mine as he traveled past.   The Brutes, although strong and violent if provoked, were not dangerous if they were simply left alone to pursue their own paths.  As he disappeared into the undergrowth, I turned to gaze at the path of broken foliage left in the wake of the beast.  Maybe I didn't hear the goblin approach because of the Brute or maybe because of my own pre-occupation with future events, but on the path of fallen limbs stood a large armored goblin.  Now, a single goblin is of no consequence.  I could, even then, destroy all except the strongest goblins that roamed these woods.  However, goblins have a habit of traveling in groups and a seemingly easy encounter could suddenly turn into a mad dash through the undergrowth with a tribe of goblins nipping on your heels.<br><br>The goblin, known, as a battlemaster among it own kind, moved swiftly towards me, arms swinging wildly.  With my sword at the ready, I cast a spell of darkness to slow and hurt the charging fiend.  Unfortunately, I did not have the time I needed to complete the spell before he slammed into me and disrupted my concentration and my spell.  Rocking on my heals and swearing at myself for not judging the goblin's speed better, I was forced to take a couple of glancing, and yet painful, blows to my armor before I could disengage myself from the flaying beast.  I managed to dodge an overhand swing and put enough distance between the battlemaster and myself to bring the Dark Reaver to bear.  I swung the weapon, simply to give myself a moment to regroup, when the Dark Reaver's true power became evident.  I barely scratched the goblin, merely broke the skin of the battlemaster, when suddenly I felt a rush of power.  The sword had absorbed the strength of the goblin and had given it to me.  The goblins features suddenly changed from excitement to fear.  I quickly brought the sword back around to finish the creature, but hit nothing but air.  The goblin had run and was quickly making its way through the woods.  I gave chase, knowing it would bring friends...many friends...to track me down, making my movement through these woods almost impossible. <br><br>There is a certain excitement about knowing that you have a foe running for its very existence, a specific thrill about making an enemy relies that it can do nothing to defeat you and chose to run for his life.  Do not confuse this emotion with the bloodlust of the Dark Elves or the brutal gratification that trolls and ogres find when they reduce another to a pool of matted hair and blood.  An Iksar doesn't find satisfaction in the simple death of other creatures, but the removal of obstacles that stand between them and their goals.  If that obstacle happens to be the death of an enemy or the destruction of a city or the acquisition of a powerful magic item after a long search, the satisfaction is the same.<br><br>I had almost caught the fleeing goblin when the spells hit me.  First, a blast of ice struck my side, throwing me off my feet.  In spite of the numbing pain, I tumbled with the force of the blast and came back up on my feet facing this new threat.   I viewed not one but two new creatures, both goblin magic users.  The second goblin caster was just completeing a spell and I suddenly felt myself tire and sag under the feeling that I should give up this fight, that sleep would be a better course of action.  I fought the sensation and slowly raised my weapon to defend myself, when the fleeing battlemaster returned to the fight.  I dodged the battlemaster's blows while taking damage from the two goblin casters.  I was going to lose this fight.  I had but one option, a spell that I had very recently bought but had little skill in performing.  I swung my sword in a broad arc making the battlemaster retreat far enough give me the opportunity to cast a spell of my own.  As I struggled with the incantation, another spell of ice stuck me and the battlemaster rushed in an attempt to interrupt my thoughts.  It would have looked to anyone watching that the goblins had succeeded in defeating me as I fell lifeless to the ground.   The goblins shrieked in their excitement and rushed my fallen body, quickly binding my hands and feet together.  Two of them threw me on their shoulders as the other reached down to pick up my fallen weapon.  I still smile at the memory of the screams and the blacken fingers that resulted from the goblin picking up the sword of a Shadowknight.  The goblin threw the weapon to the ground cursing and nursing his hand.  His two companions laughed and pointed at the ensuing wounds, almost dropping me off their shoulders.  The incident, I can only imagine, was brought up continuously as we made our way back to the goblin camp, as randomly the damaged goblin would suddenly start howling and screaming at whatever comments where passing between the three of them.  Unfortunately, I only know three words in goblin.  Two of the words are curses; the third is the word for food.  I hadn't heard the third word yet, but even in this pseudo state of death, knew I was in real danger of becoming an entree.  <br><br>Despite the bumpy ride, my Iksar regenerative powers had nearly brought be back to full health by time the group had reached the goblin camp.  Ten or fifteen goblins ran out to meet the small hunting party, all of them screaming and howling at the group who had defeated a lone Iksar.  My body was thrown next to a hut as the goblins that had defeated me started to tell the story of their battle.  For some odd reason, the story took much longer than the actual battle and I doubt the accuracy of the tail they told.  However, I figured the story was almost completed when one of them pointed at the hand of other and the group that had gathered laughed as one and started yelling at the unfortunate goblin that had touched my weapon.  The laugher stopped suddenly as a large goblin stepped out of the hut where my body lay.   I knew this goblin.  He had been the leader the tribe of goblins that inhabited Warslilks Woods for many years, and was desperately wanted dead by the rulers of Cabilis.  He was Grachnist the Destroyer.   And unfortunately, he looked almost happy.   As he stepped out, the other goblins took a half a step back from their leader.   He made a gruff comment to the group that had brought be to camp, then turned and knelt next to my seemingly lifeless corpse.  He took a dagger from his belt and cut the ropes that bound my hand and feet.  He then rolled me on to my back, and lifted one of my arms so he could examine my hand.   It was at this point, as I stared blankly into the sky, I thought my eyes where deceiving me. The hands of this large goblin resembled my hands, but they were not his hands, they where gloves.  Gloves made out of the scales and claws of Iksars.   I knew not how he had fashioned them, but I knew that if I did not leave soon that I would become very intimate with the process.<br><br>He laughed and dropped my arm.  He motioned for two goblins to grab me and take me into his hut.  The goblins picked me up, took me into his hut, and dropped me on a large bloody stone that sat in the middle of the room.  Then, fortunately, they left the hut and me by myself.  I brought myself out of my feigned death and began casting a spell of transportation.  The spell is useful, but unreliable in the distance it carries you.  I hoped it was far enough this time.  The goblins where alerted by the sound of casting, but not even Grachnist was fast enough to get in into the hut before I stepped through to a different location.  I would have not survived the experience without the help of the goblin screams for I displaced myself fairly close to where a guard was standing, fortunately he was already moving towards camp to see what all the screaming was about.  I calmly cast another spell that I had recently bought, one that allowed me to step into the shadows of Warslilks Woods and disappear from my fate as goblin armor.<br><br>I waited until daybreak to circle back and get my sword.  I would not have thought the goblins capable of subtlety, but as came close to the clearing where I had been overpowered by the goblins, there sleeping in a tree was the goblin battlemaster with the burnt hand.  He had figured I would be back for my sword, but with the coming of the dawn, had fallen asleep in the tree.  I searched the surrounding area for others, but did not find any.  I assume that the goblin figured he could take an unarmed Iksar by himself.  He was a foolish goblin.  Still blending with the shadows, I picked up my sword that was still lying on the ground where it had been left from the night before.  My cloak of shadows disappeared as my hand touched its hilt, but I was not concerned.   I walked quietly to the tree where the goblin slept and with a long swing of my Reaver, cut the branch where the goblins sat.  With a crashing of limbs and a howl, the goblin landed on his back.  I stepped on this throat before he regained his breath and brought my sword to the ready.  He stopped struggling when he saw that I did not instantly strike.  &quot;Goblin, do you know any of my speech&quot; I asked.  He looked at me blankly.  I continued with my language lesson by pointing to myself.  &quot;My name is Shrikke.  Do you understand...Shrikke?&quot;  After a couple of minutes and many repeats of my name, a look of understanding came across the goblins face.  He pointed at me with his dirty chipped claw and repeated my name.  I smiled and nodded my head.  Then with two swings of my sword, I cut off both of his hands.  He wailed in pain as the Dark Reaver not only sliced through his wrists, but also robbed him of his strength.  He was bleeding to death, so I cast a healing spell to stop him from dying.  The spell weaken me slightly, but the lose was unimportant compared to the task I had planned for this particular goblin.  I lifted my foot from his throat and pulled him to his feet.  He stood up, looking at his bloody stumps.  I then repeated my language lesson.  I picked up both of his hands and showed him the lifeless forms.  One, to my slight amusment was still slightly backened.  &quot;Shrikke...tell Grachnist that this was done by Shrikke.  Do you understand?  Shrikke.&quot;  The name of the goblin leader brought a light of recognition to the face of the goblin.  I pushed him away from me and he looked over his shoulder.  I lifted my sword again and the goblin battlemaster got the hint and started to run.  I saw him disappear the forest and smiled.  I quickly recast a spell and stepped back into the shadows of Warslilks.  <br><br>The rest of that week, I hunted within shadows of Warslilks Woods for goblins.  Many of them returned to their camp without their hands and the name of Shrikke on their lips.  I assume that Grachnist will remember my name when I return to finish my collection.<br><br>/ooc For some reason...when I import this from Word, the parenthese and apostropies turn into some other characters.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Everyone, back up on your chairs...at least those who remember Shrikke :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I am back.  The holidays are over and end of year stuff is finally done.  I have started a new series of stories for Shrikke that I hope you enjoy.  As always, please comment if you have any opinions on content or writing style.  I have thick skin...I can take it :-)<br><br>Good hunting all...see ya in Norrath.<br><br>Part 17.<br><br>All was still in the hall of the necromancers as I pulled my Khukri out of the chest of Squire Mharkas and saw the light dim slowly from her eyes.   As I knelt beside her, watching the blood pool around her body, I bowed my head and asked that Cazic-Thule welcome and honor the soul that he was soon to receive.  I understood that I had no choice but to kill the Squire, but unlike some, I was not joyful in the fact that I had witnessed, nay participated, in the downfall of my mentor.  My meditations were interrupted by the voice of Master Xydoz.  You have done an excellent job, Shadowknight.  I was surprised that the Arch Duke sent you to perform the ritual for us.   It has always been that the privilege of executing a traitor has fallen to the guild to which they belong, but is it unusual for the ritual to be performed by someone so...let us say close...to the prisoner. He snapped his hands and motioned for the page to come and remove the body.<br><br>I looked up from my prayer from under my banded helm, into the eyes of the page.  I assume that the look on my face conveyed the fact that if the page touched this body, I would surly kill him.  He suddenly stopped and slowly backed away from where I was knelling.  Quietly, I spoke, &quot;This body is not yours to use as you see fit, Master.  She was a Crusader of the Greenmist and I will take her back to my guild for burial.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, you are wrong, Shadowknight.  She had no guild.  She was a traitor to the empire and a danger to those she taught.&quot;  I closed my eyes as he spoke trying to control my rage. He continued, &quot;She had no edict to teach magic.  Only we, the Brood of Kotiz, have been given the charge, from the time of the Emperor, to teach magic to our people.  She broke that law and deserved this ending.  Now, give us the body to keep as an example to what happens to those who fail to follow the law of our people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All you say may be true, Master.&quot;  Still knelling beside the body of Squire Mharkas, I sheathed my Khukri and picked the body of my teacher.   I stood and turned toward the Master as I held the body. &quot;Or it may be that the Brood of Kotiz has used the responsibility given to them by the Emperor to gain power for themselves at the expense of their own people.  The Emperor made it your responsibility to teach our people magic, not to hoard it for yourselves only to dispense it at your own choosing.  It was not Squire Mharkas that failed her people, but you and those who would sacrifice the greatness of their own race for personal glory.&quot;<br><br>The Master's face clouded over with rage, &quot;You dare talk to a guardian of the Iksar in such a manner?  You will wish you had died before you came out of your egg, Shadowknight.&quot;  Master Xydoz began to cast a spell.  He was a powerful user of magic.  I would have died had I not had activated the circlet that was on my head and faded from view before he could complete his spell.   The page made a feeble attempt to block the door, but did not really slow my progression as I exited the hall. <br><br>I ran through the Tower of Necromancy with the body of the Squire cradled in my arms looking for an easy exit from the hall of death.  I ran down a set of stairs, only to be met by a group of necromancers and their pets coming the opposite direction.  Most of them passed by where I stood without seeing me.  I thought I was safe until the last figure in the group, a hooded form, suddenly stopped and turned toward me.  A voice I had heard before quietly resonated from under the cloak.  &quot;Shrikke?  It is good to see you again.  You who is responsible for the form I now wear.&quot;  The cloaked figure pulled back his hood.   Standing before me stood the form of Hapzass, the broodling Necromancer Larriz and I had killed in order to join a clutch during the Test.   He was older and taller than when I had last seen him, but the greatest change had come in the paleness of his scales and the two long fangs that protruded from the front of his mouth.  &quot;Last time I saw you, I had failed the Test.  Let see now if you can pass my test, broodling.&quot;  I was unable to think for a moment.  A vampire...an Iksar vampire.  This had not been seen for ages and even then had ended badly.  I ripped myself back to the present.  Hapzass was smiling and moving towards me and I could hear the sounds of others coming back down the stairs.   Again, I knew death was about to fall upon me if I did not move.  I had but one option.   Drawing upon the fear that fuels the soul of a Shadowknight, I unleashed my Touch of Harm upon the rushing vampire.  I lost the shadows that surrounded me as magic ripped through the body of Hapzass.  He screamed as every part of his body felt the wrath of the Shadowknight.  Knowing that the pain would not last and knowing that I would be dead if I did not leave the tower quickly, I rushed to my right, ran down the flight of stairs and hurled the body I carried and myself through the open window at the bottom of the landing.  The fall was long and dark, but I was relieved when I hit the canal and the safety of the water.  Without coming up for air, I swam for East Cabilis dragging the body of the Squire behind me.  No one followed me in the canal, but I knew that I would not be spending any more time in the Tower of Necromancy.  I did not know it until that moment, but I had made a very bad enemy, an enemy with a very long memory.<br><br>I managed to drag the dead body out of the canal and into the temple of the Shadowknights.  Lord Gikzic was waiting for me as I stepped through the teleporter. He didn't say a word, but took the body of Squire Mharkas and laid it upon a table.  He then turned to me, &quot;I am glad you are alive, Shrikke.  Already, we have received a command from the Necromancers that you are to be sent back to the Tower of Necromancy immediately for trial.  I believe the charges say something about heresy and the unprovoked attack upon one of their members.&quot;<br><br>I nodded my head and handed him the Circlet of Shadows he had lent to me, &quot;They are correct in their charges, but not complete in their details, Lord.&quot;  I explained completely what had happened in my time at the tower.  &quot;They wanted to keep the body of the Squire.  I'm sure that they would have used it for the same dark purposes that created the Vampire Hapzass, Lord.  The Necromancers are moving in a direction that endangers us all.  Can we do nothing about it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shrikke, go away&quot;  I blinked, twice.  What was he saying to me?  &quot;You are still young and the enemies that you face are beyond you.  I will say that I have not seen you.  I will say that you escaped out of the city before we could send you back to that pit of death.&quot;  He put his hand on my shoulder. &quot;If you want to truly influence the path of your people.  If you truly want to kill those who would destroy you, then go...grow strong in the arts of the Shadowknight.  Then comeback and face these vipers and bring them death.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where should I go, Lord?  There is no place an Iksar is welcome.  Do I become like the bandits that roam the wilds of Kunark?&quot;<br><br>Lord Gikzic shook his head, &quot;No, Shrikke.  I suggest you go to Velious.  Gain the favor of the giants or dwarves that live on that frozen continent.  There you can learn what you must to help deal with this danger.  If you survive, then come back to Cabilis.  We will be waiting for you, and so with they, I'm afraid.  He opened a chest and pulled out a long dark sword that was familiar to me.  &quot;Do you know this sword, Shadowknight?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Lord.  It is Squire Mharkas' Dark Reaver,&quot;  I replied.<br><br>&quot;No, broodling.  This is your Dark Reaver.  Now leave.  Before things become more complicated and dangerous.&quot;<br><br>I left the City of Cabilis, through Field of Bones only stopping at the Tower of Kurns to replenish my supply of bone chips.  As I headed  to Warsilks Woods, I stopped and looked upon my city.  I left my city as an outcast.  And someday, I would return to this city of my race, but not as an outcast.  Not as an orphan disowned by his people, but as an angel of death.  <br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Jan  4 12:18:45 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have read all of your posts to date and I have enjoyed them thoroughly. I would like to see more in the tale of Shrikke but, I am sure I would be most pleased with anything that you wrote. You see, I once played a Wood Elf rogue named Beofwulf on the Morrell-Thule server however, my father's computer was barely able to run it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Due to an eternity of LOADING... PLEASE WAIT, I decided I was not getting my $10.00 a month's worth. I would load so slowly that I would miss my stop on boats. I have a job now and have saved up $600.00 and am working on getting a Dell computer in the range of $850-1000. I think it is something I can handle and and something that can handle Everquest.<br>     I have missed playing very much and reading stories of Everquest, for me, has become the next best thing to actually playing the game. Many people post stories online and some, of course, are better than others but, few are as good as yours. IMHO Anyways, now that you have taken a trip on the gravy train, hopefully you will get something out of this. Thank you very much and keep up the good work scribe.<br><br><br><br>Beofwulf (at heart)<br>Rogue: 19th Coin<br>Morrell-Thule<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"Damnation is eternal.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A small apology.&nbsp;&nbsp;I expanded the story a little bit and have included the entire Part 15. instead of just the part I added.  <br><br>This is the last of Shrkke for a bit.  I am thinking of a story line for another of my characters, so look for that in the future.<br><br>Again, I can not thank enough those who have supported the story with their comments and encouragement.  And of course...if you have any suggestions, please don't be afraid to post.<br><br>Part 15.<br><br>I could tell many stories about my time in the Test.  Battles fought, hunger, cold, the constant struggle for dominance over our environment and over each other; all of these were part of the two years that I spent as a broodling in the wilds of Kunark.  Did I learn what the Test was meant to teach?  Yes, but it was not until many years later than I understood what I had learned and what the nature of the Test was truly.  The Test, above all things, teaches the lesson of balance.  When to use violence and when to compromise, when to seek your own glory and when to sacrifice for the group, when to fight and when to hide, all these lessons of balance, most races learn once they reach adulthood.  The Iksar learn them long before we ever step outside the influence of our own land, because in reality during the life of an Iksar, the Test never ends.<br><br>Before I opened my eyes, I knew that I had passed the Test.  How you ask?    The feeling of a warm clean blanket over my skin and the mattress under my body gave it away in an instant.  I had been keeping third watch, waiting for the sun to finally come over the mountains, when suddenly; I was back among my people.  I could smell the warm food being cooked by the slaves in the kitchen.  I could hear the footsteps of other Iksars walking the halls.  I waited a long time with my eyes closed, savoring the feeling of safety that I had not felt in the last two years.  I did eventually open my eyes.  I discovered I was in a small room with a fire pit set in the wall.  A small fire was burning giving me enough light to see.   Over a chair sat a tunic I assumed was for me to wear and on the table was a pitcher of water and a washbasin.  I cleaned myself, and then put on the tunic.  I was ready for whatever was next.  I went to open the door, when I noticed something the shadows had hidden from me, my backpack.  All the items that I had called my own during the Test, where there, placed neatly in my bag.  On top was my lightstone.  I had not even noticed it had been removed from my neck.  As I picked it up and held it for a moment, a flood of memories came rushing back to me.  I recalled the excitement of learning that both the belt and the robe that we had looted from the dead Hapzass both were magical in nature.  It was also the first time I had heard the word &#8220;twink&#8221;.  I remember the day when we buried broodmates, Tursbaj and Gluzligz.  Both were casualties of another clutch running through our camp while being chased by a goblin warrior.  I remembered when hunger forced us to raid and drive out another clutch so that food would again become plentiful in our part of the valley.  I remembered Larriz.  He was sleeping soundly when I had last seen him.  Had he been taken out of the valley at the same time I had been removed?  I hoped so.  I hoped to see him again in the near future.<br><br>I put the lightstone away and closed up the backpack.  It was in some ways like putting away my childhood.  I tied the top of the bag and placed it under my bed, only to be taken out and my adventures remembered when life needed a touch of balance. <br><br> I opened the door to the torch-lit corridor to find a Crusader standing guard.  He looked down at me and almost smiled.  &#8220;Are you finally are ready to start training in earnest, broodling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to learn.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Are you sure, broodling?  I would not want to hurry you into the next stage of life prepared for you by the Lord of Fear.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to start,&#8221; I stated with just a hint of confusion in my voice.<br><br>&#8220;Well broodling, it has been my experience that most would rather start their new paths on a good foot.  I believe that means that your tunic need to be turned around the correct way.&#8221;  I looked down, and sure enough in my hurry to get out the door; I had put my tunic on backwards.  I quickly slipped it around to face the proper direction.  &#8220;Excellent, broodling.  In another couple of years, you might be able to put on your own shoes.  Come with me.  You have a meeting with Arch Duke Zog.&#8221;  I followed the Crusader down the familiar corridors of the temple.  We walked through the teleport pad to the upper levels.   The Crusader pointed to a ladder attached to the back wall.  &#8220;Climb the ladder, broodling.  At the top, the Arch Duke is waiting for you.  You must hurry.  The Arch Duke does not like being kept waiting.&#8221;<br><br>I climbed the ladder as quickly as I could.  Upon reaching the top, I could see the Arch Duke waiting on a balcony looking over our city.   However, the simple task of getting off the ladder to where I could reach Arch Duke Zog was made suddenly difficult.  The floor of the room was built so that one had to make a difficult jump from the ladder in order to reach it.  I steeled my nerve and made an attempt at jumping for the landing and was rewarded being knocked unconscious by the floor in the room below me.  I repeated this activity for the next two hours, climbing the ladder and jumping to the landing, usually taking damage in the process.  Eventually, I succeeded.  As I pulled my bruised body to the balcony, I hailed the Arch Duke and bowed.  He turned and motioned me to come closer.  As I stepped closer to the Arch Duke Zog, he took me by the shoulder and pulled me next to him where I could look over the city of Cabilis by his side.<br><br>Without taking his eyes from the city he asked me, &#8220;How are you feel, broodling.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Respectfully, Arch Duke, I feel tired and bruised.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Why do you feel tired and bruised?&#8221;<br>&#8220;The climb to meet you was difficult, more difficult, than I thought, Arch Duke.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I know you could see me standing here, broodling.  Why did you not call for help?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Arch Duke.  It seemed important that I overcome the obstacle myself.  I believed that somehow the leap from the ladder to the room was a test of whether I was worthy of speaking to you.&#8221;<br><br>Arch Duke Zog nodded slightly.  Then pointing out into Cabilis, he continued, &#8220;Broodling, what do you see out there before you?&#8221;<br><br>I looked out into in the city where Crusaders and Troopers stood guard, where groups of Frogloks under the watchful of eye of the Toilmaster re-build fallen and decayed structures, where the Kloks bought and sold goods from under their tents.  &#8220;I see my home, Arch Duke.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I see my home as well, broodling.  But I also see a people under siege who are battered and bruised from the trials of the past. A once great empire that is now a shadow of it&#8217;s former self.&#8221;  He turned suddenly looked at me, &#8220;And still our enemies seek to destroy us.   Do you know why?&#8221;  I shook my head to indicate I did not.  &#8220;Because, broodling, they fear us.  They fear our dedication to our race and culture.  They fear what each of us is willing to sacrifice in the name of our cause.  The fear what can be accomplished when a people have a clear purpose without distraction.&#8221;  He turned and looked back at the city.  &#8220;Do you know why I had the floor built so far away from the ladder, Shrikke?&#8221; <br><br>I was surprised when he used my name.  &#8220;It is a test.  To see who is worthy to speak to you.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No, broodling.  It is a reminder to every Shadowknight of Greenmist that the road to the top is often filled with painful challenges and most often those challenges must be taken on by without aid.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;So, if I had asked for help getting off the ladder&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I would have killed you.  You would have not had the spark that a true Knight of the Greenmist needs in order to succeed.  Go now&#8230;learn, fight, and understand.  Become strong and intelligent.  And above all, know that the whole of Norrath is fearful because another Iksar Shadowknight will soon walk the earth.&#8221;<br><br>Part 16.<br><br>The path to becoming a Knight of the Greenmist is long.  Before I was sent out to serve my people, I had spent five years learning at the feet of the guild masters lessons in both blade and spell.  It was on my thirteenth hatching day that I received my Pawn&#8217;s khukri and sent out to the entrance of the city to help guard my people from the creatures that roam the wilds.  <br><br>Today, the Iksar are still re-building our empire and our city.  Today we still have enemies without and within that would happily destroy our race and our way of life.  However, today, they failed to destroy us.  And today, the Iksar grew stronger.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I did not have much time to add to the story this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are following the story, I am sorry.  I will try to add a little more sometime next week, but with Thanksgiving on the horizon, who can say :-)<br><br>On the issue of Thanksgiving...Everyone is aware of the issues that are going on in the United States.  I think that in the light of the events of Sept. 11th that we all feel a little closer to our families and each other.  I would suggest that you make known to your loved ones how you really feel about them during this season.  Tell them how thankful you are that they are a part of your life, because in the end you never know when you will never again get that chance. <br><br>Again and as always, please don't be afraid to give me comments and suggestions on this contining story.  Writing only gets better when you have critism.<br><br>Part 15.<br><br>I could tell many stories about my time in the Test.  Battles fought, hunger, cold, the constant struggle for dominance over our environment and over each other; all of these were part of the two years that I spent as a broodling in the wilds of Kunark.  Did I learn what the Test was meant to teach?  Yes, but it was not until many years later than I understood what I had learned and what the nature of the Test was truly.  The Test, above all things, teaches the lesson of balance.  When to use violence and when to compromise, when to seek your own glory and when to sacrifice for the group, when to fight and when to hide, all these lessons of balance, most races learn once they reach adulthood.  The Iksar learn them long before we ever step outside the influence of our own land, because in reality during the life of an Iksar, the Test never ends.<br><br>Before I opened my eyes, I knew that I had passed the Test.  How you ask?    The feeling of a warm clean blanket over my skin and the mattress under my body gave it away in an instant.  I had been keeping third watch, waiting for the sun to finally come over the mountains, when suddenly; I was back among my people.  I could smell the warm food being cooked by the slaves in the kitchen.  I could hear the footsteps of other Iksars walking the halls.  I waited a long time with my eyes closed, savoring the feeling of safety that I had not felt in the last two years.  I did eventually open my eyes.  I discovered I was in a small room with a fire pit set in the wall.  A small fire was burning giving me enough light to see.   Over a chair sat a tunic I assumed was for me to wear and on the table was a pitcher of water and a washbasin.  I cleaned myself, and then put on the tunic.  I was ready for whatever was next.  I went to open the door, when I noticed something the shadows had hidden from me, my backpack.  All the items that I had called my own during the Test, where there, placed neatly in my bag.  On top was my lightstone.  I had not even noticed it had been removed from my neck.  As I picked it up and held it for a moment, a flood of memories came rushing back to me.  I recalled the excitement of learning that both the belt and the robe that we had looted from the dead Hapzass both were magical in nature.  It was also the first time I had heard the word &#8220;twink&#8221;.  I remember when we buried broodmates, Tursbaj and Gluzligz, on the same day.  Both were casualties of another clutch running through our camp while being chased by a goblin warrior.  I remembered when hunger forced us to raid and drive out another clutch so that food would again become plentiful in our part of the valley.  I remembered Larriz.  He was sleeping soundly when I had last seen him.  Had he been taken out of the valley at the same time I had been removed?  I hoped so.  I hoped to see him again in the near future.<br><br>I put the lightstone away and closed up the backpack.  It was in some ways like putting away my childhood.  I tied the top of the bag and placed it under my bed, only to be taken out and my adventures remembered when life needed a touch of balance. <br><br> I opened the door to the torch-lit corridor to find a Crusader standing guard.  He looked down at me and almost smiled.  &#8220;Are you finally are ready to start training in earnest, broodling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to learn.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Are you sure, broodling?  I would not want to hurry you into the next stage of life prepared for you by the Lord of Fear.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to start,&#8221; I stated with just a hint of confusion in my voice.<br><br>&#8220;Well broodling, it has been my experience that most would rather start their new paths on a good foot.  I believe that means that your tunic need to be turned around the correct way.&#8221;  I looked down, and sure enough in my hurry to get out the door; I had put my tunic on backwards.  I quickly slipped it around to face the proper direction.  &#8220;Excellent, broodling.  In another couple of years, you might be able to put on your own shoes.  Come with me.  You have a meeting with Arch Duke Zog.&#8221;<br><br>Happy Thanksgiving all!!<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After a number of tales, I thought it was time for a bit of a rant.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was playing one of my favorite alternate characters, a dwarf paladin.  He has newly started his 20th season and is excited about getting rid of the damage cap and getting the Ghoulbane he welds to finally proc. <br><br>Well, without pause, I ran to the Estate of Unrest eager to make the undead of the zone completely dead once again.  Upon entering the zone I searched for a group and was invited to join a group of four in their high teens - another dwarf pally, a gnome enchanter, a druid, and a cleric.  Being the highest level character, I was asked to pull and was happy to do so.  With the Spirit of the Wolf running through my veins I started pulling the dark boned skeletons and ghouls that roam the lower level of the Estate.  I was exceptionally pleased to see the the message - "A ghoul has been hit for 137pts of non-melee damage"  I love that sword.<br><br>Anyway, after clearing the easier part of the first floor (round room and attached hall) and easily dealing the undead, I poked my little dwarf head around some of the rooms to inspect some areas in which I have less knowledge.  As you can imagine, I was soon shouting "Train to zone."  Four ghouls and a couple other skeletal types who's names I can not currently remember began chasing me out of the Estate.  I was not too concerned.  I still had SOW and the zone was fairly empty.  I could lead these creatures to zone without endangering the party at large.  I made my way out of the side door, again shouting "Train to zone."  Made my way to the point between the bush mazes to find that the creatures had stopped chasing me and were killing my party members.  They were a heroic group ...they thought I was about to be killed and came to save me.  I could not leave them to die.  So, with a LOH on the other Paladin who was almost dead and a couple of quick heals for the enchanter, I jumped into battle.  All the time, yelling for the others to run.<br><br>The outcome was not as bad as it could have been. Three of the five members made it to zone.  The enchanter and I did not survive the experience.<br><br>So as I ran back from Greater Fay, I was thinking a few things.  The first, have faith in the character that you have asked to pull...or ask someone else to pull.  Pulling creatures comes down to judgement and all good pullers know that their first job is to keep their group safe.  In the lower end game, that means when a pull goes bad that the puller leads the creatures to zone and avoids this group.  In the higher end game a bad pull basically means the puller stops in a good location for his/her corpse to be recovered.  If your puller does not know these rules, get someone else to pull.<br><br>Secondly, I thought that even though the group I was playing with could have used better judgement, that they had acted heroically and well within the spirit of roleplaying.  It was exciting fighting a battle with monsters everywhere, knowing that there was little doubt that this battle was going to end poorly.  I sometimes get tired of pulling for experience or camping for a specific item and find the real heart of the games comes from when you lay your life on the line in a seemingly hopeless battle.<br><br>I really like this game.  It allows me to talk to friends that I would normally not see regularly.  It gives me opportunity to meet new and unusual people.  It gives me a bit of an adrenalin boost that has not been as much a part of my life since my wife and I started having kids.  (My wife always thought I was nuts for wanting to ride my bike up a dirt trail, just to have the experience of riding back down at very high speeds around rocks and trees.)  <br><br>I complain as much as everyone about specific parts of this game, but where else can I get 25-30 hours of enjoyment for 10 bucks a month and stay in touch with old friends at the same time?<br><br>My final thought?  Have a good time out there. Real life has enough stress without adding stress to what is supposed to be the fun part of our lives.<br><br>Good hunting all!!!<br><br>From Parttime and his alter ego...<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Excellent Sir Parttime.&nbsp;&nbsp;I to play a dwarf paladin on the PVP server Tallon Zek.  What you said about the bad pull is correct.  I suspect that perhaps the players you were grouped with were not high enough level yet to recognize that you were trying to pull the train away from them.  Also, I have hunted Unrest many times, and can tell you that trains from inside have a mind of their own.  Sometimes when you you pull them outside they will run in the opposite direction around the estate to chase you to the zone.  This pathing can cause the train to become larger and more dangerous; or, it can cause it to attack the group you were so valiantly trying to defend.<br><br>What I am trying to say is that Unrest is a dangerous zone where stuff like this happens all the time.  Look at the good side.  You died after using your lay on hands and healing and brawling, allowing most of your party to escape alive.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Oh, mightest of the self proclaimed lords of the green, smelly, butt iching types...<br><br>It has been known for many seasons that the armies, lead by Innoruuk, have been gathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not fear, my fellow Iksars and I will be more than happy to stand still and wait for your (What did you call it?  Oh..yes.)  Your "Great Offensive(tm)" to come wandering into our lands.  Actually, we thank you for bringing our past slaves and servants back to us, instead of us having to extend our reach and dragging them back from the ill fated life they live in "Da Swamp".<br><br>Trolls don't make the best slaves but could be considered amusing in a "Look, that troll has his finger stuck in his nose" sort of way.  Plus, make excellent fertilizer when ground up properly.<br><br>Dragons, Giants, and our own creations have waged war to wipe the Iksar from the face of Norrath.  I'm assuming that a bunch of liquored up, green, pimply butted trolls will be more of an afternoon tea party, then a real war.<br><br>And if you want to know fear, I would suggest you consider what happened to your kind the last time your failed your god.  He turned you into the gelatenous blobs you are today.  And to add insult to injury, turned your woman into the third...behind female ogers and dwarfs...ugliest creatures on the planet.  No wonder your race is so hostile.<br><br>I welcome your kind to my continent of Kunark.  Please come over and pick up your maid uniform anytime you like.<br><br>With all due respect and in the tradition of the rant...<br><br>/ooc I'm assuming this is a fun bantering of words.  Pusbag, I have enjoyed your posts over the last year.  Please feel free to post here anytime you like.  Your particular sense of gaming is refreshing :-)<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

My idiot cousin, who I keep in the castle basement, does a better job of needling me than your pathetic verbalizatons.<br><br>What you have not realized is that the Trollen female form is the most arousing, curvacious, and arresting on the face of Norrath.  All the rest of the races, Ogres excepted, are either too skinny or are too scaly.  And that infamous butt scratching is a method of marking her territory by scent.  But then your lizzy nostrils are too dull to smell the fine essence of a woman, aren't they?  You rely on gaudy colors to identify your mates along with those diaper-looking things to differenciate between the sexes.  Bah.  Inferior beings!<br><br>As for my "Great Offensive(tm)", you'd best be hoping I am speaking in jest, because you will be a mere house cleaner when I am finished with you, Shrikke - Knight living in Fear.<br><br>--Pusbag Infection<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>
