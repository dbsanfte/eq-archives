	   <tr><td colspan=2>It took her several weeks before she finally arrived. She chanted the words to her illusion spell to make her appear as a human and approached the gate. The guards smiled to her, welcoming her to their city. Alluring made her way to the prisoner holding cells. As she made her way deeper into the labyrinth of cells, she saw that most of them were empty. She was not sure of what this man looked like, but she felt certain she would know him when she saw him. She finally reached the last stretch of cells. This was by far the darkest area of the prison. She walked to the end of the hallway, one final door at the end. This door was made of steel, unlike the others which had bars. There. That's where Prozen was kept. Cautiously, she reached her hand towards the door. As soon as her hand touched the cold, hard metal, she heard a voice. &quot;It's not going to work, you know.&quot; Alluring whirled around, but there was no one there. 'Did Prozen perhaps already know what she was here for?'-she thought to herself. She replied to the air, &quot;And just why won't it work, m'lord?&quot; There was silence for a moment. &quot;So, they think if they send a woman down here, they can get me to talk, do they?&quot; Prozen replied coldly. &quot;Go back to your Master and tell him he shouldn't send his chamber maid to do his dirty work.&quot; He said with a sneer. Immediately, Allurings' temper flared up, &quot;How dare you! I am no-ones' chamber maid, and I certainly have no Master!&quot; she said venomously. A cruel sounding chuckle emerged from the cell. &quot;So, please, humor me. What are you doing here then? Did they send you down to bed with me?&quot; asked Prozen. By this time, Alluring was absolutely fuming. She retorted, &quot;I hope you know I was coming here to try to get you out! Now I'm starting to think you deserve to be in there! Oh, and one more thing just for the record: I don't make my bed with humans, and even if I did, I certainly wouldn't do so with the likes of YOU!&quot; A stunned silence followed her rash statement. Allurings' face went pure white, as soon as she realized what she had said. In an effort to try to cover her last reply, she quickly asked Prozen, &quot;S..ss..o, d..do..you want me to help you out of there or not, because I really don't have t..&quot; &quot;Stop!&quot; Prozen interrupted. &quot;Let's back this up a bit. You wanna go over that last part with me again, please, because I don't know if I heard you right.&quot; He demanded. &quot;Please, m'lord, we don't have time for that right now. If we are going to get you out of here it needs to be now!&quot; she pleaded. She held her breath, hoping beyond hope that he would forget about what she said. She heard him take a deep breath. &quot;Well, then. Just how did you plan on getting me out?&quot; he finally replied. Alluring sighed in relief. &quot;Please stand in the furthest corner away from the door, if you would. I am not sure if this will work the way I plan on it.&quot; She replied. She had used her spell of Chaotic Feedback on creatures, but had never attempted to use it in this way before. She was unsure of the effects when it was cast on an inanimate object. She concentrated mainly on the lock of the door to focus the spell energy towards. Brilliant red light shot forth from her hand and struck directly upon the lock. Sparks flew everywhere. She heard a slight clink noise. She reached for the door handle. It pulled downward with ease. She slid through the doorway and opened her mouth to speak, when a rough hand clamped firmly over her mouth. The sliver of light quickly dissipated from the crack in the door, as it was quietly but swiftly shut. Alluring felt a rush of fear send tingles up her spine. What was happening? What had she gotten herself into? Maybe he was more dangerous than she was led to believe. She began twisting her body in panic, desperately trying to break his hold. She felt him lean his head towards her, felt his warm breath on her ear when he whispered harshly, &quot;Calm down. Stop moving or you'll get us both caught.&quot; Surprised, Alluring paused for a moment. That's when she heard muffled voices coming from beyond the door. Footsteps were approaching. Her heart pounded so hard, she thought they could surely hear it. Pressed against Prozen as she was, she could feel that his every muscle was tense as he also strained to hear if they had been found out. After what seemed like an eternity, the footsteps and voices slowly faded away to nothing. They were gone. Alluring had not realized she was holding her breath, so when that rush of air came forth from her lungs she was startled from the sound. She turned to Prozen to try to assess how she would get him out of here. The black eyes that met her own silver ones seemed to peer straight to her soul. Her breath caught in her throat. Abruptly a look of bewilderment crossed his face. He blinked a couple times, as though trying to clear his vision. It then dawned on Alluring that she was still under her illusion. She had been so spellbound by his eyes, that she had disregarded her own spell. She realized it must have faltered by her lack of attention and quickly regained her concentration on the spell. She turned from him and said, &quot;Well, now for our next problem. How are we going to get you out of the city, m'lord?&quot; With that, they began their plans of escape.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Oct 29 15:01:59 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nanraa continued in her fighting and training. She was had advanced well into her 25th season, when she finally decided it would be safe to return to the common lands. When she arrived back to the west common land druid ring, she began walking east towards her homeland. Along the path, she saw a younger gentleman waving a paper around in the air, a closed satchel hanging from his shoulder. She was yet too far from him to distinguish what he was saying. As she neared him, she heard him saying, &quot;Qeynos Times only 5 gold pieces, Qeynos Times here, get your paper!&quot; Nanraa gave him the gold and received the Qeynos paper. On the cover of the paper was an article regarding a man named Prozen, whom had been jailed for beheading gnolls within the city walls. The article stated that he had done this several times before. Nanraa turned the page and saw headlines that made her breath catch in her throat:<br><i><b>REMAINS FOUND IN NAGAFEN LAIR	</b><br>Today, diggers found an unidentified body at the Nagafen lair. The only clues as to who it might be included a green helmet and chest plate, as well as what appears to be part of a ceremonial wedding sword. The only engraving on the sword that could be read was:</i> For Love. For Nanr...<br><i>If anyone has any information regarding this mystery, you are urged to contact the captain of the Qeynos guards. </i><br>She no sooner read this, when off in the distance she heard thunder. Nanraa looked to the sky to see storm clouds swiftly blacking out the sunlight. The rain started fallen soon after. She turned to continue her journey home, her worry still sitting in the back of her mind, when she was stopped yet again. There standing before her was a Halfling. It was wearing a cloak, made of the deepest black, its' face hidden behind a mask. It was holding some sort of package. The wrapping almost resembled a cloak that was drenched in blood. The Halfling walked up to her and whispered &quot;You are the cleric Nanraa, are you not?&quot; Curiosity and a slight bit of fear started to well up inside her. &quot;I am.&quot; She replied. The Halfling set the package at her feet. Without another word, he ran off down the path. After a few feet along the path, he disappeared into thin air. Nanraa was thinking how odd this was, but turned her attention to the packet at her feet. She leaned over to pick up the package, when she noticed a gray colored note attached to it. Her brow furrowed as she tried to recall if it had been there before. She removed the note and unfolded it.<br><span style='color: red;'>To My Dearest Nanraa<br>Do not open this package<br>Unless you are alone<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;                   Mervin</span style='color: red;'><br>Nanraa felt as though a hand made of black ice had just gripped her heart. She saw that blood had been used to write the note. Making sure she was alone, Nanraa unwrapped the cloak. Inside she saw a broken blade engraved with the words: &quot; ...aa, Forever in my Heart.&quot; Under the blade was another note, which Nanraa picked up with trembling fingers. <br><span style='color: red;'>Find my brother Prozen.<br>He can be found in Qey...</span style='color: red;'><br><br>The rest of the note was smeared. Nanraa wrapped everything back into the cloak, placing the cloak inside her backpack. Quiet tears of mourning rolled down her cheeks. She knew she could not go to Qeynos, for she would be killed on sight only because they do not agree with her Deity there. Her mind was racing, trying desperately to think of someway to get to Prozen. Then it dawned on her; if she could find her cousin Alluring, she could send her cousin to find him. Alluring was an enchantress. She could make herself appear to be anything she wanted people to see. It only took Nanraa one full night and day to get back home. When she arrived, she went straight to her cousins' favorite hiding place. She was in luck, it seemed, for Alluring was there. &quot;You certainly took your time arriving, dear cousin.&quot; Nanraas' jaw fell in shock as she replied, &quot;What do you mean, I took my time? I had only just gotten back from the moon, and then...&quot; A soft chuckle interrupted Nanraa. Her face became flushed as she realized that Alluring had been teasing her. Alluring gracefully lifted herself off of her bed of soft, silk covered pillows and glided over to Nanraa. They hugged briefly, and then Nanraa proceeded to inform Alluring of the situation at hand. Alluring agreed that it would be best for herself to go to Qeynos in search of Prozen. With a start, Nanraa remembered seeing that name before. She withdrew the paper from her backpack. It seemed that Prozen would be locked in the jail for quite some time for his latest disturbance. Alluring set out at once to Qeynos.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Oct 29 13:55:18 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>	Over the next few months, Nanraa and Mervin became the best of friends. However, Nanraa sensed something deeper emitting from Mervin. She was starting to think that perhaps he wanted more of a committed relationship. Her heart still ached from the loss of Valdare. She was not sure if she was ready for anyone new to enter her heart. Before Valdare, Nanraa had lost someone else dear to her heart. The memories of Duskett and Valdare still haunted her. Still she never understood what had happened to them. They simply vanished without a trace, leaving Nanraa alone once again. Alone, and wondering. <br><br>One day, in the midst of November, Nanraa received a parchment. The wax seal had the mark of Mervin embedded into it. With trembling fingers, she broke the seal and unrolled the paper. This is what she saw:<br><br><i>	My dearest Nanraa, <br>It saddens my heart to have to tell you this. However, I would rather tell you than to leave you with no notice. I must travel to Highhold Pass. Word has reached my ear of a mighty orc rebellion stirring in that region. I must lend my strength and my sword. Be wary, though, I sense a foul disturbance afloat in the wind. Something does not seem right, but I cannot decipher what it is. Stay safe. I shall return as quickly as the gods will permit me to.<br>					Yours always and forever,<br>						Mervin</i><br><br>	Nanraa felt as though she were trying to swim through quick sand. In that one moment, the world seemed as though it had stopped spinning. Nothing felt real to her. At the back of her mind, she knew she should destroy the letter in the chance that someone should happen upon it. Her heart refused to let her get rid of it, though. It was all she had to hold on to. She folded the letter with great care, and hid it in the very back of her spell book, sealing the last page over it. Nanraa told herself to be patient with Mervin, for he would write to her again. Everything would be ok. At least, that is what she wanted to believe.<br>	That next month, Mervin indeed wrote to her again. As soon as Nanraa saw his seal, her heart soared with relief. She had been so anxious for him to be safe; she had hardly been able to concentrate on her training. She quickly opened the letter. Her smile gradually faded when she read what he had sent.<br><br><i>	Nanraa,<br>Please listen to me. It is very critical that you do. You MUST leave the Commons. I have been captured. Somehow I will find a way to get this letter to you, but please leave as soon as you read this. Find my brother. He will help you. Tell him that the rebellion was.....</i><br><br>The rest of the letter was gone. The carrier had flown through the rain to deliver the message. She was uncertain, though, if the partial letter was caused from the rain or something more sinister. Nanraa swiftly folded the parchment and placed it inside her tunic. She gathered up her belongings and rushed out the door. She felt her awareness heightened to an extent she had never felt before. She had been wary since her first encounter with the hostility shown to her so many months before, but nothing like she felt now. Her eyes seemed as sharp as eagles' vision; her skin felt the slightest change in temperature, the slightest of breezes; she could smell hundreds of scents; every little sound reached her ears, down to the smallest twig cracking. She knew this was the heightened awareness of fear. Dusk was already taking over the sky, so she had a slight advantage of the oncoming darkness to aid her escape. Her vision during night, even before now, well exceeded that of the humans, who needed lamps and lightstones and such. Nanraa admitted that the Great Lightstone was very useful at times. However, given the critical situation she now faced, she had wrapped the stone in one of the furs from the storeroom and placed it in her backpack to hide the light. She ran westward, avoiding the small huts and inns as much as possible. She still did not know whom she was supposed to fear, whom her enemy was.<br>	 She was able to reach the druid rings in the western Commons before the sun rose. Nanraa was entirely exhausted, but knew she had to travel further. She had to try to find Mervins' brother, but first she had to get to someplace safe. She saw a kind looking druid, and asked if he would be able to help her travel to someplace far away from Antonica. The druid thought for a moment, and then his eyes lit up. &quot;Luclin!&quot; he said. Nanraa replied, &quot;Luclin? Where is that?&quot; The druid answered, &quot;Luclin is a moon. It is definitely far away from here.&quot; He chuckled, and with that, chanted a few words. He held his hand out to Nanraa. She no sooner grasped his hand, when the world she saw disappeared. A vortex of colors swirled before her eyes, yet no sound reached her ears. In that next moment, hundreds of chattering voices were all around her. Nanraas&amp;#8217; vision cleared and she saw so many people. The druid smiled and said, &quot;Welcome to Luclin.&quot; He disappeared into the crowd. Nanraa was nervous being around so many people, but decided to look around. After asking a few people, she was able to find the location of a town called Shadow Haven. All sorts of people came to this town. She walked around taking in all the sights.<br>	 She had walked quite a ways through town and was standing in front of an open doorway admiring the rather large flowers, when an ogre accidentally bumped into her. The sheer force of the enormous creature toppled her over inside the building. She stood up, brushed herself off and looked to see if anyone saw her. She saw a man standing in the corner who looked slightly irritated. Nanraa walked up to him and said, &quot;I'm sorry sir, I did not mean to enter so rudely. You see, I was just standing in the doorway and....&quot; He waved his hand at her in irritation. &quot;Young lady, my aggravation has nothing to do with that. You see I have some letters that I need to get to someone, but I am unable to leave my post!&quot; &quot;Well, I have nothing to do. Would you like me to deliver the letters for you?&quot; Nanraa offered. A broad smile crossed the mans face. &quot;How absolutely wonderful that would be! Yes, yes, here. He is in the Bazaar. Thank you so much!&quot; He handed the papers to Nanraa. She placed them carefully in the front pouch of her backpack and headed out. A few more errands later, Nanraa found that word had quickly spread of her willingness to help the locals. The merchants now even smiled when she walked in the door. Nanraa was just leaving from one of the merchants when her eyes caught sight of a sign over a door. The sign was for an inn, and Nanraa was suddenly reminded that she had not slept since she first left the commons. Drowsiness hit her like a brick. She managed to make her way up to her room, and then the darkness of sleep took her in.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Oct 17 15:12:10 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nanraa heard a shuffling sound off to the left. She turned her head to see what had made the noise. A few seconds later, she ran into something very solid, but seemingly warm. Startled, she swiftly turned her face towards the object she had collided with. She found herself facing cold hard steel. Confused, she cautiously drew her eyes upward. She saw the steel was form-fitted over an enormous chest. Her eyes resumed their vertical journey, until they rested upon another pair of eyes. They returned to her a stony gaze. She felt an unfathomable guilt, as if she was in the wrong for even being alive. Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. Nanraa stammered, &quot;I...I...m...sorry...I w...wasn't paying attention sir. Please excuse my ill manners.&quot; She backed away from him and bowed her head. She gave him a weak smile. The guard snapped at her, &quot;Move out of the way! I've got a patrol to do!&quot; He then leaned his face close to her own. Sneering at her, he loudly whispered, &quot;Why don't you go back where you came from, darkie? You don't belong here. Never have, and never will.&quot; He straightened upright, and arrogantly marched onward to continue his patrol. Nanraa stood there for a moment, completely bewildered. She felt angry and hurt. Why should she be made to feel guilty for being there? Who did he think he was anyway? A seed of resentment planted itself in her heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;                Slowly, she came to the realization she had lost track of the dwarf. Scolding herself, she hurried along the path in the direction he had been going. After a short time, she saw brick walls looming before her. She slowed her pace as she approached the entrance to (what Nanraa assumed to be) the city. More of these odd looking people were standing at the entrance. She saw several beings entering and leaving the city. She saw a few that looked similar to the guards and watched them intently. She snuck forward to get a better look. For the second time that day, Nanraas' face flushed with embarrassment. This time though, the cause was her own silliness. She had thought the metallic faces were odd, but soon realized that the metal was just a covering not unlike her own peoples helmets. However, the lightness of their skin and peculiar height was still foreign to her. As she walked through the town, she received similar looks that the outer guard and short man had given her. At this point she was feeling very unwelcome and so turned around to leave the city. Her pace quickened the more she looked around to see the hateful stares.                              By the time she got to the city entryway, she was at a dead run. Nanraa felt her foot catch on something lying on the ground. She had a sensation of being briefly airborne as her feet came out from under her. She hit the ground with a hard thud. Nanraa laid there for a moment, trying to breathe. As the dust settled around her, she drew her arms up and under her chest. With a painstaking effort, she tried to push herself up off the ground. Before she knew it, a pair of large arms wrapped themselves around her. Gently, but firmly, she was lifted up and carried to a tent. A warm hand pressed against her forehead. She heard a deep voice whisper softly to her, &quot;Are you okay, m'lady? I sincerely apologize. I was quite careless with where I placed my big feet.&quot; Upon opening her eyes, she was revealed a pair of intense brown eyes. They stared at her with complete concern. &quot;I just need to catch my breath is all, m'lord.&quot; Nanraa replied. A mischievous smile played along the strangers lips. &quot;As do I, m'lady.&quot; Questioningly, Nanraa searched his eyes with her own. A quiet chuckle emerged from his lips. &quot;Please do not look so concerned. I only meant that I am in awe of your beauty. I hope that does not offend you.&quot; Her cheeks flushed and she cast her eyes downward. &quot;Oh, now look what I've done. I have gone and embarrassed you. I deserve a proper punishment for that. I shall hurry to find the nearest executioner.&quot; Nanraa looked up, startled. She saw the stranger still sitting there, only this time his lips were spread back in an all out grin. A hearty laugh erupted from his mouth when he saw how her jaw had dropped from his statement. &quot;I am sorry to tease you so. I should not do that, what with you sitting here hurt.&quot; &quot;I'm okay. I...um, well, I'm not used to your kind is all. My apologizes.&quot; She replied. At that, she stood up and started chanting the words for her healing spell. The scrapes on her knees and arms quickly disappeared. When the last word of her spell was spoken, she looked as though she had never fallen in the first place. <br>She turned to the stranger and said, &quot;I am sorry, we didn't get properly introduced. My name is Nanraa.&quot; She held her hand out to him. He grasped it in his hand and replied, &quot;I am Mervin. It is a pleasure to meet your acquaintance.&quot; And with that he placed a kiss upon her hand.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;     For that next entire year, Nanraa stayed in Neriak. Maybe if she were to wait just one more day, it would be the day he would return. That year went by, but Nanraa hardly noticed it. Time seemed to stand still here. She continued hunting, salvaging anything she could from the corpses to sell to keep herself fed and clothed. She kept hoping that someday Valdare would return. She knew in her heart, though, she was only delaying the inevitable. The forest, in its own way, was her shield from the world. If she left the forest, she would have to come face to face with reality: the reality that Valdare was never coming back. That day came, when Nanraa finally found herself releasing her grasp from her illusion. She could no longer pretend that he would be coming back. It was time she left the forest that had blanketed her for so long now. Nanraa packed up some food and water supplies, her spell book, staff and a decent amount of coins. She searched through her wardrobe and took out that which would protect her best from anything unpleasant she might happen upon. She was not surprised to find that a few of the pieces she selected were the very items that had been given to her from Valdare. Once she was sure that she had everything she would need for some time, she began her journey out into the world.                As she approached the darkened tunnel, which marked the outer edge of Nektulos, she slowed her pace. She was actually doing it;.she was leaving her home. Nanraa drew a deep, ragged breath and steeled her nerves. She closed her eyes for a moment of remembrance, and then continued on through the tunnel to the outside world. A flash of brilliant, blinding light greeted her widened eyes. She turned her face away from the radiant light, allowing her eyes to adjust. She slowly turned back towards the paths'end. Her eyes still ached some, but she was adjusting quite well to the brightness. She looked around a bit and caught sight of a well worn pathway. She ventured onto the path, her eyes glancing about with wonder. The breeze here was much warmer than that from the Nektulos forest. She eventually came upon a crossing in the path. Nanraa was standing there debating her choices when she noticed a short, pale being walking upon the path towards her. She recognized it as a being similar to the Leatherfoot Scouts that wandered through her beloved forest. As he got nearer to her, he finally caught sight of Nanraa. She still stood there looking at him curiously, wondering what to do. His eyebrows furrowed and a look of contempt overcame his face. He shoved her aside when he reached the area she was at, and plodded along down the path. In all of her fifteen seasons, she had never experienced anything like that. Her own people felt very affectionate towards her. The leatherfoot people always tried to chase her from what they considered to be their territory.             She turned towards the receding back of the tiny man and followed. She was concentrating so much on watching were he was going, she did not notice the creature moving towards her until it was too late. <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Oct 10 18:02:56 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;           Nanraa jolted awake still screaming. She could hear and feel her heart pounding in every fiber of her body. Sweat was clinging to her, yet she felt cold as ice. Something had happened. She knew not what, but was absolutely certain something was wrong. She turned back the sheets and sat up at the edge of the bed. She sat for a few moments to calm herself, and then closed her eyes. She set her focus and let her mind wander; reaching, trying to sense him so she could be reassured. She allowed her mind wander further and further, constantly searching. She began to feel a prickly sensation at the back of her neck. Her stomach and heart felt as though they had dropped into a bottomless pit. She felt that same panic, which had awoken her, start to rise up in her again. Her mind screamed out: NO!!! Tears welled up in her amethyst eyes. Her bottom lip started to quiver ever so slightly. Her breath was ragged as she struggled to regain control of herself. She knew why she had awoken so suddenly. She knew why she had been so frightened. She knew what that dream meant. She knew........he was gone, never to return to her embrace.<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Oct 10 17:39:00 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2><i>It was a dark, dreary night in the Nektulos forest. The rain was coming down hard. With the storm clouds and the tightly woven trees throughout the forest, you could hardly see anything at all. Nanraa was disappointed she was not able to enjoy this most dismal of nights. At the same time, though, her heart was joyous for soon she would be wed to her soul mate. She knew the forest well. There would be another night like this again sometime, and she would enjoy it to the fullest extent. Sighing, she turned from the window to study the view in the full length mirror before her. She saw before her, an image of ravishing beauty. She was wearing a raven-coloured wedding dress. A thick golden band with a single onyx jeweled pendant adorned her slender neck. Her hair had been formed into an elegant twist at the back of her head, with long tendrils of hair flowing down from it. She smiled at the reflection. She turned and walked towards the door of her room. Just as she was reaching for the handle, the door swung open with great force. Startled, a small scream emerged from her throat. There before her loomed cold-black emptiness. She felt no presence of her great Lord Innoruuk and knew this was not his doing. She felt, instead, an overwhelming fear rising within her. She felt herself being drawn into the void by some unknown force and desperately reached out for something to hold on to. Her hands found the doorways edge. She clung there, holding on with all her strength.The room tilted and spun. Nanraa closed her eyes to try to block the dizziness that overcame her. The doorway which she had been holding on to, suddenly gave way. Nanraa screamed as she fell into that nothingness that quickly enveloped her.....<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Oct&nbsp;&nbsp;7 14:44:18 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
