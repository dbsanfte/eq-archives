	   <tr><td colspan=2><span style='color: green;'><br>Another entry in the column of madness. We now track Rhiante into her mid life... she is still 30, and her situations haven't changed drastically, but they have changed, and I feel like bitchin' so I turn to my AK journal, or 'column' really. <br><br>Well, Rhiante is still 30... alright, so she's 33 or summah at the moment. The euphoria from going to 20-30 in three days has worn off now that Raven and I are going at our regular snail pace levelling. I guess levelling fast just isn't us. We've been sitting at our mid-life for so long, about 3 months or more. Since the date of the other post, really. Yes that long. Yes, I'm not a big enough geek! I gotta play more! <br><br>As usual, all the people I knew are now level 50+ but I don't mind (is jealous) so much (is really jealous)... *swallows*<br><br>I'm OK... really... (no she isn't, she's jealous)...<br><br>*sigh*<br><br>But it isn't so bad, because in the time we've been waiting, we earned enough money to buy some Centi Longswords for Rhiante, and she now has two. We decided that we may as well save our money and go all out rather than upgrading here and there which will cost us more in the long run, so we did. I have to say that when I chose them to buy I wasn't going for looks-- I'd seen them around but had no idea that those red runed monster swords were Centi's and when I got mine I was pleasantly surprised. Rhiante looks rather cool thanks to them, and I now I always get inspected, compared to before when I never did! I don't know if I miss looking untwinked! I was hassled less! Still, I love the swords to bits and I think i'll be right for lots of levels to come. I purposely didn't get a Wurmy for various reasons. Mostly I wanted the dual wield to hit in succession, and i'm not entirely sure the Wurmy is that great, due to conflicting stories from varios experienced rangers. Plus Centi's look cooler.<br><br>On other Rhi news, I did the stupid quest, with the brownies. I have to thank the one anonymous poster whom informed me that killing the pixies at their tower in Lfay spawns Brownie Outcasts! It's true!! They do!! Thank you, whoever you are, there wasn't a lot of hints on how to get brownies to spawn, so Raven and I tried that on a whim and it was true. I now have all the arrows and I'll be able to do the leggings quest shortly. Brownies are considerably easier to kill with the Centis.<br><br>However... funny thing happened, Raven wanted a pair of Black Ice Leggings, and so I got them. Well, while the icon looks plateish; they do not, they look like dark ringmail-- we were hoping it was black platemail. So, the leggings went to me, and Raven is going to get himself something else that looks platish. The Black Ice leggigns are currently better than the Ivy Etched, so I kinda did the brownie thing for nothing, but still-- I'm going to do the quest because 1) I have all 6 arrows and 2) It took so much time to get the arrows that I'd feel cheated if I didn't do the quest. <br><br></span style='color: green;'><br><span style='color: olive;'><br><br>Someone asked me why my journal is green and olivey, and it's because Rhiante is a ranger and i'm obsessed with green, I thought it was fitting, plus it's a break from the all black. They also asked if i'd make my journal postable for comments and the answer is no, unfortunately. I see so many wonderful journals which are littered with trash and derogatory comments from cruel heartless people that while I love to hear from the nice people out there, a few people have ruined it for everyone else, and so this is protected until they give us the power to delete inane posts from our own journals. However, you can still E-mail me at: Rhiante@allakhazam.com if you want to abuse me, or contact me, and I am available in game via tells if you're nice about it. <br><br></span style='color: olive;'><br><span style='color: green;'><br>Well my friend is now level 30; so that means grouping and (hopefully) levelling, so I'll have something other than &quot;Rhiante got gear today. Is goo. Rhiante gear is goo. Purty gear. Swords big.&quot; like today. (Hopefully I sound less idiotic than that, but you know it is 4am, so I can't be sure.)...<br><br>However, school has started for her, (blechzzz) so it means less playing, so maybe I won't get Rhi to 50 something any time soon. Oh well, I don't mind (so much)... <br><br></span style='color: green;'><br><span style='color: olive;'><br>Anyway onto bitchin...'<br><br>(Maybe I should call this 'the bitchin journals of Rhi'... ? )<br><br>I've been meaning to rant about this for a while, but now we're 30, we've been looking for a good guild. (We being Raven and I; my significant other)-- the reason is (or was mainly) because I needed help getting ivy etched stuff (heh heh); but apart from that we wanted a group of close knit people (with half a brain) to be with friendship wise. <br><br>I didn't think getting a (good) guild was so hard, but it is. Almost all the (good) guilds have imposed an almost impossible signup requirement or humiliating the proposed members by having them sit through interviews, or meet everyone in the guild. I'm sure this sounds logical for guildmates, but for non-guildies, getting to know <i>everyone</i> in the guild is a pain the the posterior. For me, I can't even hope to hop all over Norrath and say hi to everyone before I get put on a trial period. I can understand the necessity for this, but I also think it's more along the lines that some guilds don't <i>want</i> new people to join, and thus make it almost impossible to do so. <br><br>I suppose it's less that they don't want me, and more that they don't really think about it, because they have their friends, and we're not part of that. I can understand that they don't really concern themselves with making it easier for me to find them and join with them, because (as they see it) i'm the one wanting to join, they're not the ones who want <i>me</i> to join. <br><br>I can think of 3 guilds that I've since abandoned all and any hope of joining because of this. Because it's almost impossible. All right I said almost-- all right so it can be done, but at the end of the day when I've had to meet everyone in the guild and/or been put on trial and/or been vouched for and/or been accepted-- will it be worth it? <br><br>I don't think it is.<br><br>Even though the people are all so nice, and even though it would be nice to join them, I don't want to, and I no longer need to. All I can say is that i've stopped trying; it doesn't matter to me anymore. Oftentimes, the standards that the guild is demanding of me, the guild does not meet themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I think that guilds having high standards of it's members is fine, but you know what, i'm a semi-intelligent person with at least half a brain and I don't think it's unfair of <i>me</i> to ask high standards of any guild I'm thinking of joining. It's not just about what they think of us, but what we think of them. Yet often, they are elitist; frankly, and our heads have to go down the toilets (figuratively speaking); before they'll even consider us. I don't think that's right. I can see where the attitude comes from (with the kind of people EQ draws to it sometimes); but that doesn't make it right. <br><br>In the end, Groucho Marx said it best, &quot;I won't be part of any club that would have me as a member.&quot; ;D<br><br>Heh heh, I suppose that'll ring true for me for a couple of levels, until I can find a guild that i'm happy with, and who's happy with me. I'm sure there's a guild of nice intelligent people out there somewhere, who geniunely wants new members and doesn't make me run the gauntlet to join them... maybe i'll find it over the rainbow....<br><br>--Rhiante--<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2><span style='color: green;'> I haven't played in the longest time; not to level anyway. It's been about 2 months and Rhiante hasn't moved off from 30. It's like she hit a plateau. I suppose it's imitating life in that respect... she's going through a mid-level crisis. Nevertheless, I have been playing on and off, her and other characters. My cleric has gone from 5 to 15 these past few weeks. I haven't played Rhi a lot... and so no journal posts. I suppose I just feel that there isn't a lot of point posting on my journal if I haven't really done anything special at all with her... but I have been doing a few things, and as always, the rants just keep on comin'....</span style='color: green;'><br><br><span style='color: olive;'><br>Anyway onto bitchin'...<br><br>Rhiante is trying to get her <b>Ivy Etched</b>...<br><br>It is a pain in the ass...<br><br>I can only imagine what the epic is like... *shudder* So far I have quite a few components for the Ivy items I want, but i'm missing some. I don't think i'm going to replace my tunic, but while waiting for Brownie Outcasts to spawn in Lesser Faydark, Raven and I saw Thistle Underbrush. He dropped the right rune of Ivy. Still no Brownie Outcasts, so Raven and I said what the hell, and went to kill Meldrath over in Steamfont. We needed help but I have his skull.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Now we need rubies... <br><br>rubies are freakin' expensive...<br><br>I hate rubies.<br><br>I don't think I'll use the tunic anyway, but it will be nice to have. I really prefer my Brigandine to the Ivy Etched.  Speaking of Brownie Outcasts, I need a whole bunch of arrows from them... <br><br>They are tough little suckers...<br><br>I hate brownies. <br><br>The outcasts i've killed (1 is all i've found so far); he had one of the arrows. Apparently you need to collect 6 different named arrows for the ivy etched leggings from the brownies. Sometimes the brownies have duplicates so it means killing more than just 6... Bleurgh. He was yellow to me and Raven at 30 and rooted us. He does a ton of damage, and we would have died without lay hands. Thats not the reason I hate brownies, I hate them for a lot of reasons. I hate them because they're never bloody spawning! Lesser Faydark is really a kind of 'just running through' zone; and there's no one camping these guys but me and Rave, yet when I check track I never see one. When I DO check track all I bloody see is 'Equestrielle the Corrupted'...<br><br>When I see that, I run.<br><br>She's a scary sight, I have to say. Nothing much scares me, but when I first saw her running me down I thought; &quot;oh okay, scary black horse coming at me full force, don't panic, you have SOW, and the zone is right behind you...&quot; And then I saw; &quot;Equestrielle Strikes YOU for 700 points of damage&quot; and THEN I panicked. I was literally meters from the zone, I knew she was coming (from track) and she had me down to a bubble once I got to the other side in no time flat. The 700 poitns of damage was her harm touch in full force and apparently she doesn't like... well, anyone...<br><br>And she sees through cammo.<br><br>I hate Equestrielle.<br><br>I can't hunt in Lfay for the Brownie Outcasts if she's there because she runs at SOW speed and can basically kick our asses at 30. Plus that harm touch is a doozy. She's supposed to be around 40 or higher. What sucks is that when I appealed to the high end Gfay residents to off her, this one obnoxious guy of around 40 asked why. When I told him he basically said 'oh ok, bad luck'-- zoned to lfay with no intent of helping me at all-- even though he gloated that: &quot;I've killed her once and she's easy.&quot; Well if she's so frikin' easy, why is your group invising themselves as they go into Lfay? If it's to not kill her to spite me, well thats just mean...<br><br>Joke was on him though, invis failed while they were there and Equiestrielle was around the corner, and they had to fight her.<br><br>It's karma, I swear.<br><br>He later sent me a tell saying what had happened, and that he killed her. When I thanked him for being nice of him to kill her for me, he told me he had no intention of killing her for me and it was all an accident. <br><br>Group of lvl 40s or so, going through Lfay who can probably take her down (and she's their level), knew I wanted her out of the way, and they decided against helping me at all? <br><br>Thanks a bunch. I'm HAPPY your invis failed, and no wonder she was easy-- she had used up her harm touch on ME. =P<br><br>I hate Equestrielle.<br><br>God getting Ivy Etched sure is traumatic.<br></span style='color: olive;'><br><br><span style='color: green;'><br>Anyway, Raven needed Amstaff's Scroll to complete his ghoulbane so we flew Air Rhiante (which is a fancy way of saying we ran really fast); down to Highkeep again. A lot has changed, everyone is new, the people I used to group with, are all gone, all higher levels than me now. They must play a hell of a lot. I only saw one familiar face, Striekeing-- (yay someone I know is still there! whee!) but I didn't group with her. Raven got the scroll pretty quickly and is now over the moon about Ghoulbane. My weapons are looking crappier and crappier as time goes by... i'm really happy for Rave, no doubt he'll want to use Ghoulbane soon. Rhiante leveled and both her and Raven are 31 now. Not much higher than before, but still higher. It's still fun grouping in Highkeep even though Rave and I didn't intend on coming back ever again. It was my first time back since I got SOW, and I think Rave and I might stay while the exp is good. The group was good, became bad due to one person in particular, then was good again. The leader (Kromer) really did an excellent job of being group leader, ML and listkeeper and did a much better job than me when I was in HK I have to say. He was a really nice guy... I went LD twice and he even kept my split for me. Aaaw. =) Wish there were more such players in EQ. Had a thing about tuna sandwiches but I won't hold that against him. ;)<br></span style='color: green;'><br><br><span style='color: olive;'><br>On other news one of my bestest friends was goaded into buying and playing EQ. (Yes by me). I've been playing as my Cleric Lessy with her and we have been doing excellent progress. We started off at like 5 and are now 15. Lessy isn't my main at all, but it's more fun playing with my friend which is another reason i've neglected Rhi. However, my friend has been frantically tying to get her monk (Trys) to 30 so that she, Raven and Rhi can group. We're helping her, or trying to at least. Trys is at 15 so far, and she finds grouping frustrating because people are idiots a lot of the times (especially the lower levels). She's died a lot in WC due to Hill Giants, Dragoon Zytl and Kizdean Gix. Raven and Rhi got down there to smite them good for the times they killed all our newbie characters. Boy that felt good. One of these days we're going to have to get Varsoon and Pyzjin... <br><br>Anyway Trys is 15 which isn't too far off 30 at all. I find everything is much easier in 3, and I can't wait till Trys can group with Rhi and Raven... although I won't be able to go in all super-hero like and save Trys from whatever is kicking her butt anymore... oh well. Which reminds me, I'm supposed to write what will go well with Raven and My's character groups. We're intenting for Trys to be the 3rd wheel in our buggy or third point in our triangle... that'll seriously rock... EQ is much more fun now Trys is playing. I have to write that guide out for her or she says she'll make characters on a whim! No Trys, don't do it! ;)<br></span style='color: olive;'><br><span style='color: green;'><br><br>Final thought... why is it so many people hate Rangers? Some say it's because they don't have a unique characteristic (like say, Summon Warder, Lay Hands, or Harm Touch). I suppose thats true, track can be done by not only bards but druids too. Thats a bit of a kick in the pants, if you look at fantasy type settings such as D&amp;D or Lord of the Rings, only the rangers can track. That's unfair and I don't know why they did that. I think if track were ranger only, it would make a whole group of ranger-bashing people admit rangers aren't so bad, because you could always say &quot;well they can track and no one else can.&quot; I don't think it's a big deal, and I don't want to take track away from the druids or bards now they have it, but I hate that fact being used agaisnst rangers. It's an excuse to say they suck at times.<br><br>I still think they're great, but others use the fact that they have no unique ability against them. But no one class can do what a ranger does... you can say &quot;Just get a druid and a warrior and you don't need a ranger&quot;. No I guess you don't, but that's because a Ranger is part of both. All hybrids are. Just get a cleric and a warrior and you don't really need a paladin, in theory. Get a Necro and a War and no SK needed. Get a Monk and Shaman and forget the beastlord... <br><br>Thats what hybrids are, you know. Crosses of 2 classes, which means they get the pros and cons of their parent classes.  They are no better nor worse than any other hybrid class. <br><br>Rangers are so cool in fact, their AC has to be lowered compared to other melees because the skills they get would give them too much of an advantage. They also hinder their healing ability. They purposely have drawbacks for rangers because without the balance it would be unfair. It would be like a caster warrior. To stop that, they give them penalties. It's only fair. It doesn't make a ranger any less useful or fun to play. All the hybrids have penalties on them. Look at Raven; he has the ability to wear higher AC; and has more HP than Rhiante. However he gets no kick, dual wield, or critical archery hits. Which means he does less damage. Which means that if he soloed he'd take longer to kill the mob even with bash. Rhiante would kill the mob quicker, but would get hit more... thus it evens out.<br><br>Some people say Rangers can't be soloed but c'mon, can any class really be soloed? This is EQ for God's sake... it's an online rpg. If you want to solo, disconnect from the internet, buy Baldur's Gate or Might and Magic or Diablo and solo away. Soloing. Puh-lease. Whats the point of playing if you're just going to solo? Plus Warriors can't solo because they have no heals and no rooting spells. Paladins can't root. Druids can but they're limited to kiting. Rangers can track the thing they want. Root it. Cast on it. Shoot arrows on it. If it breaks the root  they can fight their way out. If things get really bad they can run away with SOW. They certainly seem easier to solo than some of the other classes. Like all things Rangers have good and bad points. I think the bad is focused on more than the good. Why do people bash classes so much anyway? What has this class done to you? Nothing. What will bashing accomplish? Nothing. I like all the classes for various reasons which is why I have one of each. They're all cool. <br><br>I wish more people saw it that way.<br><br>--Rhiante Wylite--<br>Female Ranger of the 32nd season<br>Within the realm of Luclin<br> <br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2><span style='color: green;'><br>Well it's over... I can't do the roleplay anymore. I know that it could be great but I lack the time to start yet another story (I write fanfiction and people are lynching me over there for leaving stories hanging). I'd just leave this one hanging too-- even though it's fun to write-- I just don't have the time or motivation...<br><br>So i'm scrapping Rhiante's roleplay. (For now), and changing my journal listing as 'general'. It'll be random musings about the game and other stuff, rather than a story. I commend the others with beautiful roleplay stories. I might continue the roleplay some other time, but for now it's just going to be general talk. I might keep the first roleplay post up there but i'm a bit undecided on that... probably no one will care if it goes but maybe someone would like to read it...? Who knows.<br></span style='color: green;'><br><span style='color: olive;'><br>Anyway onto bitchin'... <br><br>Well Rhi hit 30th last night while hunting in High Keep. I learned a few things:<br><b><i><br>1) Being leader, Main Looter and List keeper is very very very stressing<br><br>2) /doing /split splits coins evenly NOT AMOUNTS.<br><br>3) Don't break the enchanter's mezz (sorry Garamonde...)<br><br>4) Some people in EQ are extremely nice (and some are not but the majority I grouped with last night were very cool! =D) I love all you guys in HK-- you're the best, thank you all for great grouping.<br><br>5) People say they want to be on the list for the camp but it's all lies-- lies I tell you! <br></b></i><br><span style='color: green;'><br><br>(1)-- I found it hard to keep track of my party, the loot and people wanting to join the Warrior Room in High Keep. I was getting frazzled by the end, because I had like 20 people talking to me at one time-- people wanting to join the list, group members wanting to leave ('Rhi can you sell and split? I'm leaving...') plus goblin warriors popping up while i'm selling, group screaming, me wondering if I should go down, me going down to help, us surviving, me going up to sell again ... arrgh! Plus if you check my items, (click on the link under bio) you'll see I have CHA decreasing items-- so I have to take those off and put my CHA bracelet and necklace on every time before I sold to get the most money I could, and i'd keep forgetting to put my boots and mask back on every time! (I didn't want to ML but no one else offered). <br><br><span style='color: olive;'><br>2) Last night I was Main Looter for the first time in my life, I have to admit. But I realised that when (some)MLers do /split they keep the remainder! Be careful of the person you allow to be main looter. <br><br>For example, one time I had 11pp to split, we had 6 people. 11 goes into 6 -- 6 times with a remainder of 5. The remainder goes BACK to the MLer, plus their split (so my group got 1pp each and I got 6pp). Of course I realised what happened (6pp? there was only 11pp thats not right...) and then I figured it out, so I put my split (1pp) aside and then resplit the 5 when we had more money. (I really couldn't steal from people who trust me so much). I just never realised the remainder thing. Of course it makes perfect sense but I never thought about it until it happened to me.<br><br>Anyway it's good to be aware of-- i'm sure that there are not only MLers who don't realise this and pocket the money (or some maybe purposely) but also group members who don't realise this and LET them. What a good Main Looter should do before splitting write down the amount and divide it manually, then split and keep the remainder in the groups 'money pool'-- and I hope thats what people do (thats what I do but I dunno if thats what others do as I can't really check on them).<br><span style='color: green;'><br>3) This is pretty self explanatory. I broke the enchanter's mez <b>*hangs her head*</b> I just get in when they beat on the enchanter and try to root the mob so that the enchanter can get away to mez-- but sometimes he'd mez before I'd root and the autoattack (still going) would break it. Sorry sorry! I have to get used to turning it off and on depending...<br><span style='color: olive;'><br>4) I can't complain about the people I grouped with, they were all really nice and I hope I see them again. (The mean people were usually lootstealers and farmers passing through. Grr) <br><span style='color: green;'><br>5) If you're going on a list and you log, please /tell the person who listed you. I had 7 people on the list and when push came to shove all but two had logged. Only one told me they would of those 7 (thank you who did). Oh and if you want in on a group and GET in and then you leave in 10 mins-- thats bad form. I don't know if their exp wasn't to their liking or whatever, but come on... <br><span style='color: olive;'><br>Anyway regardless of the fact I had to keep track of so much --oh woe is me! ;) --I have to say, only one person died on the 7 hours I was group leader! Even though I wish that number was zero, I'm pretty proud of myself. I was group leader for a very long time and saw at least 10 people pass through the group and during that only one died, but our clerics gave him a rez, so it was't too bad. In the previous group with Ravenfeather (where I wasn't leader), we suffered a massive loss due to hyperactive pulling and all but one died. (And he was pretty close himself). It wasn't the leaders fault, it was bad luck (she went LD in a crucial moment); but I'm happy that in my time I didn't, and hit 30 pretty easily. <br><br>I just hope I was a good leader and everyone had a good time in the group... I wasn't sure if that was the case, but... /shrug I think I did a good job. I certainly didn't have a problem with anyone I grouped with (only people outside my group), so I hope it was the same for my group. =)<br> <br><span style='color: green;'><br>Now Rhi is 30-- and it's probably the coolest level to hit as a Ranger. After waiting for SOW for the longest time, I know have it whenever I want. It was the best feeling. I spent all of tonight getting my spells, running across Norrath, I had to go to Surefalls because of the fact the Druid/Ranger guild in Rivervale was missing some (and I had to go up to Luclin to get Riftwind's Protection). I never thought Rhiante would get to the point where I can't decide between what spell to memorize! I've had to split them up into attack mode vs buff mode for non group situations... I was oom a lot already with my 22 spells, and now I get really cool ones so i'm sure i'm going to be oom a lot!<br><br>hitting 30 was really cool... halfway there....!<br><br>~Rhiante 'Rhi' Wylite<br>Female Ranger, <br>Luclin Server<br>(Send me a tell if you want, I don't bite! Well not unless you deserve it...)<br><br>---<br>Random bit of trivia:<br>Rhi and Raven have killed over 1082 kobolds together...

	   <tr><td colspan=2><span style='color: Green;'> Orginally this was just going to be a roleplay journal, and not one for random thoughts.<br><br>However, I find myself wanting to put my 2copper pieces on the table in response to certain things that happen to me when I play, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Therefore i've gotten rid of the roleplay journal and it's just always /ooc musings. I'm sorry. I might keep writing Rhiante's story someday soon... until then... get used to rants and ravings of a ranger chick with little sleep<br></span style='color: green;'><br><span style='color: olive;'><br>Well anyway onto bitchin'...<br><br>Today I played with a group who had free for all looting on... I really hate this method. Usually the person who says 'this is FFL' -- is the one who's looting everything before everyone else. The person in question was very nice, I just don't like that system.<br><br>Rhi is my main. I do need the money, I won't pretend I don't. I'm not a twink, I wish I was-- if I was i'd be happy to go for a FFL style. But she isn't and so leveling is fun but if I can't make some money, I can't upgrade my stuff, and I still have banded leggings and mantle on at level 28 (and probably still will at 30!) I have nice stuff for my level, considering i'm not twinked, but still...<br><br>Thankfully the only person going for the 'FFL' loot system left and my group went into the ML mode. I wish all the groups had a ML (main looter) looting system. For those who don't know, basically /autosplit is off, and one person with 0pp and 0 money goes and loots everything from then on. Usually the person with the highest charisma, or the person who doesn't get encumbered easily can hold it. Once the person is full or encumbered, or bored-- they go sell. If there's a bank nearby they convert all to pp. <br><br>Then they /split money with the group. Now for those who don't know, i'll enligten you-- Split works like this /split &lt;platinum&gt; &lt;gold&gt; &lt;silver&gt; &lt;copper&gt; so say the ML makes 100pp 50gp 300sp and 2111sp and there's no bank-- the ML would type /split 100 50 300 2111 and it would EVENLY divide it with the group. When you /autosplit it doesn't evenly split the money. The person looting gets the most, and everyone after them the least. And if you have monks in the group you can't do that anyway.<br><br>Well we were doing this system until the main looter went linkdead and 'conveniently' never returned. Thats the only downside to ML system. You have to trust your groupmates. We're not sure if it was intentional, but it was very very convenient to say the least.<br><br>People like that dig their own grave-- I have /logging on so it saved his name, AND guild. You'll be sure his guild head will be getting a nice little /tell if his does that again, and he'll be getting a nice /tell himself if I see him again. And I will see him again, this is a small world where you can't hide, and being a bad person will only harm yourself in the end, you'll be sure everyone in my group remembers that guy and not in a good way, and they know people who know people... etc. <br><br>Our second MLer (Strikeing! =) ) was a very trustworty, and she reminded me why I like the main loot system-- we all got 30pp or so each as our split in a group of 6 by the end, and we all left knowing that we got the most we could. If you group and you're not using the ML system-- do it-- and if the others don't know what that is, tell them, I guarantee it's a good system. =)<br></span style='color: olive;'><br><br><span style='color: green;'>Hmm what else? Well yesterday I met a Bard with a bad superiority complex. What is it with being above a certain level? Do you become an automatic jerk after you hit 30? Or is it genetic? (Actually I know a lot of nice 30s, so that can't be it, it has to be genetic). I can't stand people who run around and loot steal or whatever, or be a nuisance. This one was telling us we were going to die because we were too sucky. in actuality we were fine-- we were the perfect level and outclassed the monsters, but still got good exp. Once he saw that he retracted his statement and said: &quot;Well u must be twinked, Raven u look twinked, everyone stick to Raven lol.&quot;  To Ravenfeather, who said 'Eh? No this is my main.' and they guy said &quot;Oh u fake it well...&quot; and I said 'Heh Raven twinked? I'm stronger than him him and <i>i'm</i> not twinked, hee hee' to which he said; &quot;I am stronger than everyone in your entire group, hee hee&quot; which could or could not be true. He looked pretty twinked.(And was also a moron, maybe uber twinking drains braincells then, I think he was a level 37 or so bard... not a nice person).<br><br>Then he kept running around trying to lootsteal our pulls and asking who wanted to duel him... /sigh He didn't seem mean, just annoying.<br><br>Man poor Raven's stuff is crappier than mine at the moment, my AC is about the same-- and im a Ranger and he's a Pally-- so him being thought twinked is pretty funny. The thing is, he looks really really cool, but in reality the stuff, well it's decent for his level, but not twinked thats for sure. He needs to upgrade more than me, and even I need a bad upgrade soon! He's getting his smithy up for himself and me... i'm going to have to check AK for an upgrade to my pants...<br><br>Actually I look like i'm wearing banded all over, which is probably why no one thinks i'm twinked, which is good and bad. Good because I get hassled less than Raven, and bad because they think i'm crappy and my stuff is crappy because it doesn't look cool, sometimes, but I don't care cuz I <i> feel </i> cool on the inside. =D<br></span style='color: green;'><br><span style='color: olive;'><br>Final thought... I have Luclin enabled and all the models on. I wonder if my face has changed. doing /facepick actually changes your old model face, I don't know if you guys know-- so all the people with models off or without Luclin are probably seeing me with a different old model face than the one I had orginally picked! =O<br><br>Now to be incredibly superficall and vain: I hope it's not an ugly one because I only really liked one old face for the Half Elf female (it was the one with the brown hair w/fringe and brown eyes). I thought that was the cutest. I have red hair now (sometimes I /facepick it to brown depending on my mood); I wonder what my old face looks like now? I'll have to go into EQ without models activated and check out Raven, Rhi and all my alts, and what faces they have on under the old models...<br><br>What they should do is make your old face saveable so that it never changes, and let /facepick only affect you if you have Luclin but alas, that seems too much to ask from them...<br><br>As for ranting about the Luclin models... thats for another time... ^_^<br><br>--Rhiante--<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Jun 19 16:21:38 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
