Evil seems to be spreading its influence over the world in a much broader fashion than I ever imagined.  Even the Butcherblock Mountains, the very backyard of my people, have seen a marked rise in the number of ogres and other servants of the dark forces.<br><br>How is this possible?  I myself have struggled against evil for most of my life, and so many others I know have as well.  It is what I have dedicated my life to as a holy servant of Brell Serilis.  And it breaks my heart to think of how much of my work, and the work of others, may have been in vain.<br><br>There is something at work here... something much darker and more powerful than the countless zombies and risen dead I have slain.  What is the driving force behind the rise of the dark powers in Norrath?  I am not sure, but I cannot help but wonder if the evil gods have something to do with it.  It is certain that they are benefiting from this, and that is usually a good indication of who might be supporting a particular action.  <br><br>I think I will be travelling to the planes much more frequently.  Perhaps a visit with Cazic Thule and Innorruuk are in my not-so-distant future.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

However, it also includes tasks of much greater humility and compasion, such as making sure that none of the citizens of Thurgadin go hungry.  Working from the butcher shop owned by &lt;whoever&gt;, I have learned a great deal about the preparation of dishes unique to Velious.  many of them are not only tasty, but also quite nutritious as well.  I have become particularly fond of the Velious recipes for frost giant steaks and pickled wurm.<br><br>The Coldain are a fascinating people.  As fellow dwarves, they have a great interest in many of the same things as we Faydwer dwarves, such as mining and brewing.  They have adapted marvelously to the cold and ice of Velious.  I never thought I would see dwarves so skilled in the training of animals, or in the use of bows.  <br><br>I feel I still have a lot to learn from them.  There is much yet to do here and I must get back to my cooking.  </p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

After a brief period of rest and restocking of supplies, I will be returning to the fray.  There is a chance that the frost giants have captured them and are holding them captive.  There is only one way to find out for sure, and that is to go to Kael Drakkal, the city of the frost giants on Velious.  I hear that large parties of adventurers set out from Thurgadin to raid the giant city on occasion, and so I hope to join them and make my way deep into the city.  <br><br>My numerous trips to Velious have taught me that the giants have been extraordinarily cruel and vicious to my distant brethren, the Coldain.

I knew that must speak with him, but I also knew that I could not easily get that far inside the gnoll's caves.<br><br>I decided I would have to risk it, and so I went to Shadowhaven and bought several potions that I felt would make the job easier.  One type was a type that allowed me to run as fast as a wolf.  I figured the easier to outrun those nasty gnoll guards.  Also, I figured I would be better off getting in and out unseen, so I also bought a potion of invisibility.  Thus, I could run right past all the gnolls until I got to the jail.  A fellow paladin told me where the jail was located and had even drawn me a crude map.<br><br>&quot;How do you know he is there?&quot; I asked.<br><br>My friend smiled.  &quot;Because I have been there to see him.&quot;<br><br>I looked at him in amazement.  &quot;Then why didn't you free him?&quot;<br><br>My friend sighed.  &quot;He did not wish to leave.  He seems more intent on trying to convert the gnolls that to escape.&quot;  He shrugged, as if to say he did not understand and was not going to try.<br><br>I thought to myself, this Brother Hayle must be a strange character.<br><br>Well, I made my way to the plains of Karana and found the entrance to the gnoll's caves.  I took out my two potions and drank them.  Soon I was running past the gnoll guards and had made my way down to the jail, where I saw the cell in which Brother Hayle was sitting, looking remarkably peaceful.<br><br>&quot;Brother Hayle, my name is Gorfrey Bellhewer, and I am here to help you, and to get your help in return,&quot; I whispered to him.<br><br>&quot;Come closer,&quot; he said.  &quot;I can't see you, and I can barely hear you.&quot;<br><br>In frustration I looked around for a way to open the cell door.  I saw what looked like a switch on the wall.  I pulled it and the door opened.<br><br>&quot;Come on, now is your chance to escape,&quot; I whispered.  &quot;Hurry!&quot;<br><br>He just stood there, looking for all the world like he was in some sort of trance.<br><br>&quot;Brother Hayle, come on! What are you doing in there?!?&quot; I whispered more loudly, suddenly beginning to lose my patience.  I was beginning to appear and getting out was bound to be harder than getting in.<br><br>&quot;The question is, what are all of you doing out there?&quot; he replied with a smile.<br><br>My jaw dropped. Shaking off the urge to leave him, I ran in and grabbed the apparently confused human, and then heard the jail cell door close shut behind me with a loud clang of metal upon metal.<br><br>The gnoll guards laughed.  One of them spoke up. &quot;They never learn, do they?  This fool doesn't want to leave.  It is nice to have some more foolish paladins to keep him company though.  And say hi to your new roommates, too,&quot; the guard said with an evil snarl.  Just then, I saw the two somewhat emaciated looking gnolls come out of the shadows in the cell, looking for all the world like they planned on dining on dwarf.<br><br>The first gnoll walked towards me.  &quot;A tasty morsel, yesssss?  I wonder if it is a little pig.  Let's see if it will squeal for us.&quot;<br><br>I backed myself into a corner.  Grabbing my weapons, I wondered how I had offended Brell and what I could do to redeem myself and get out of this mess.  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Feb 14 16:07:26 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

I had not realized it was such a popular place to visit.<br><br>I was happy to mingle and enjoy myself, as I had not been able to socialize and drink in quite some time.  I thought that perhaps I could ask questions about the mysterious wreck that had been found on the coast - the wreck that I hoped had carried some of my family to safety. <br><br>No one seemed to know anything.  The Thurgadin dwarves were friendly but not very helpful.  For some reason, they seemed to not fully trust me even if I was a distant relation, so to speak.  Frustrated with the lack of progress, I decided to wander outside the city.  <br><br>The terrain outside was beautiful but cold.  Snow covered everything, but there was a small creek that led down away from the waterfall that hid the entrance to Thurgadin.  I decided to wander along its bank for a while.  After all, you never know where you might find a good spot to fish.<br><br>As I walked along the banks of the stream, I saw large tracks in the snow.  They led towards a gaping cave in the side of a hill.  The water led into the cave, and knowing that the fishing in the caves of Kaladim was good, I decided to make my way in and see where the stream went.<br><br>As I entered the cave, I heard heavy ponderous footsteps echoing from deep inside.  I wandered a bit further in, and then I noticed a side tunnel that had not been obvious before.  I looked down the tunnel, and saw that approaching me was an enourmous beast, not quite as large as a dragon, but still fearsome looking.  I looked at it closely and saw it had no wings.<br><br>A wurm, I thought to myself.  I reached behind me and unslung the large polearm I carried.  Well, I thought, let's find out if this weapon truly deserves the name given it - Wurmslayer.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

The letter had the familar wax seal of my friend and mentor, Gunlok Jure.  I picked it up off the counter and cracked the seal.<br><br>&quot;Gorfrey Bellhewer, son of Amaral:<br><br>I do not wish to be the bearer of disturbing news, but a matter of great importance has come to my attention.  Please return to the guild hall as soon as you receive this message.&quot;<br><br>I immediately picked up my packs that I had dropped on the floor and headed north through the tunnels to the great temple of Brell that housed my order.  I found Gunlok Jure pacing in front of the building, deep in thought.<br><br>I stood before and him and saluted. &quot;Hail, Gunlok Jure.&quot;<br><br>He returned my salute, &quot;Hail, Gorfrey Bellhewer.  I am glad you have come.  We must meet with the head of our order.&quot;<br><br>I was somewhat surprised, as I had never appeared before Datur Nightseer before.  He was a very wise and battle-hardened dwarf.  I started to wonder what this was all about.<br><br>When we entered the hall, we found him at the top of a stairwell, looking out over the courtyard where young paladins were receiving their training from the masters of the guild.  He turned as he saw us come up the stairs.<br><br>&quot;Ah... young Bellhewer. Welcome, Gorfrey son of Amaral.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I thank thee, my lord,&quot; I replied respectfully.  &quot;How may I be of service?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is my understanding that you are now aware of the circumstances that led to the death of your parents.  What do you know of the rest of your family?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is nothing to know, as I have no other family, my lord,&quot; I replied.  &quot;My friends and guildmates are my only family.&quot;<br><br>Datur rubbed his beard thoughtfully.  &quot;No, young paladin, I am fairly certain that you DO have other family members.  You are not the only Bellhewer to survive the great battle that took your parents' lives.&quot;<br><br>I trembled slightly as I felt that my heart would burst.  I was shocked to learn of how my parents had died because of the traitorous Sir Lucan, and now what did this mean?  <br><br>I cleared my throat and spoke. &quot;Lord, what family?  How many of them?  Where are they?&quot;  I tried to contain my emotion, but it was obvious that this matter was affecting me.  <br><br>Datur put his hand on my shoulder and smiled.  &quot;We do not yet know, I am afraid.  We learned that when the rescue of Firiona Vie succeeded, part of the rear guard cut off due to Lucan's treachery escaped.  We had always believed that they were wiped out, but now word has come to us that some have survived.  Your brothers and uncles were among these dwarves in the rear guard, as were your cousins, your sisters and your sisters' husbands.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where are they?  Why did you not tell me sooner?&quot; I was upset and growing angry, but Canloe looked at me with a look that showed his disapproval.  I calmed down and said &quot;Forgive me, my lord, I was hasty.&quot;<br><br>Datur smiled.  &quot;You are not the only dwarf who lost family, Gorfrey son of Amaral.  We do not yet know who survived or how many.  We only know that a contingent of the dwarves your father led into battle that day on the island of Kunark has survived.  We received word of this from the elven outpost only recently.  Even they did not know that anyone from that rear guard had managed to get away.&quot;  He looked at me gravely.  &quot;You have a strong heart, and your courage is great, my young paladin, but had we told you earlier where we believe they had excaped, then you would only have gone yourself and almost certainly died.  The land where they are believed to have landed is cold and hard and is populated with creatures that even we here could not easily defeat.  The recently discovered land of Velious is where we believe the survivors landed.  Scouts from Thurgadin only recently found the remains of the ship where they came ashore.  It is not known how many made it to the ship or how many survived the long journey, or how many may still be alive, hidden somewhere on Velious.  The giants and the orcs hunt the dwarves mercilessly there.  We simply do not know.  But there is still hope.&quot;<br><br>I sat down in a nearby chair and stared at the wall.  What does this mean?  Am I being called to rescue my family?  What shall I do?<br><br>&quot;I will pray to Brell for guidance,&quot; I suggested.  &quot;I hope that he will show me the path to take.&quot;<br><br>The elder paladins looked at each other and smiled and nodded.  &quot;Take this time to rest.  Your next voyage will be to the land of Velious.&quot;<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Jan 16 11:35:59 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

Intrigued, I walked over to it.  For some reason, it felt as if the book beckoned me to it.  I reached out my hand towards the open pages.<br><br>When I touched the book, I found myself standing in a wondrous city I had never seen before.  There were many tall buildings and bridges that conected various walkways.  <br><br>As I wandered around this strange city, rubbing my eyes to make sure that I was not dreaming or had not fallen under some strange spell, I noticed a gnome sitting under a large tree.   He was scribbling furiously on a sheet of parchment.<br><br>&quot;Hello there,&quot; I said.  &quot;Can you tell me what this place is?&quot;<br><br>The gnome looked up at me, apparently somewhat irritated that I had interrupted his writing. <br><br>&quot;This is the Plane of Knowledge, my good dwarf,&quot; he said matter-of-factly.  &quot;People come here to learn from those that have much experience in the world.  Some people also come here to make their fortunes, as I do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really... to make your fortune?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Are you a merchant?&quot; Or a thief? I thought but did not say aloud.<br><br>&quot;Well, yes, but I do not have everything I need just yet.  As soon as I have my basic stock in I will open up shop. so to speak.  Say, I don't suppose I could get you to help me?  I will pay handsomely for your services.  My name is Trep Thilcan.  What is your name, friend?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am Gorfrey Bellhewer, loyal Paladin of Brell,&quot; I replied with a slight bow.  &quot;I am not a merchant and have no desire to be one.&quot;<br><br>The gnome wrinkled his brow.  &quot;No, no, no, you misunderstand.  I do not want you as a clerk, I want you to help me gather my stock.  I do not want to leave this spot, as it is a good one, and I am afraid that someone else will take it from me.  If you can take this magic box and fill it with items from this list, I will pay you handsomely.  Please, master dwarf, I beg you... have pity on a poor gnome who has not the strength to carry such a heavy load from across the land.&quot;<br><br>I sighed.  &quot;Very well, master Thilcan.  I will fetch your items for you.&quot;<br><br>The gnome clapped his hands with joy.  &quot;Wonderful! Now, here is the list of items I need.  If you have any costs that are incurred, I will gladly reimburse you.&quot;<br><br>I waved goodbye and wandered away.  I began to read his list.  It did not look too difficult to get.  Hmmm... Thurgadin.  Ah, yes, the dwarf city in Velious.  I had never been there.  It seemed as good a time as any to finally make the trip.<br><br>After asking a few passers-by how to leave the Plane of Knowledge, I wandered around until I finally found a giant stone marker that read &quot;The Great Divide.&quot;<br><br>I took a deep breath, and reached over and touched the stone.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Jan 10 16:36:05 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

The only Erudite paladin I had ever met before was a worshiper of Prexus, the God of the Oceans.  He spoke to me of his great city while we sat around his campfire in the Mountains of Rathe.  <br><br>&quot;I do not know thee well, Gorfrey, but I think you would find the city beautiful.  You at least appreciate culture and beauty, much more so than your fellow dwarves.  I dare say many of them have no more appreciation of art and culture than a barbarian.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but do not be too harsh on my fellow dwarves.  We merely have a different idea of what that beauty is.  A Dwarf can find beauty in the way a mountain is shaped, or the way a pick sings when it strikes a vein of gold, or the color of an ale that has been brewed to perfection.&quot;  I leaned back and smiled.  &quot;Still, I do not take offense.  I know there is much truth in what you say.&quot;<br><br>The tall Erudite looked at me thoughtfully before you spoke again.  &quot;Still, I think you have the possibility of proving your worth to me.  You have certainly earned the respect of many of my companions here, who have seen fit to bestow you with the secrets of the Armor of Ro.  Thus, I will also.  You must first prove to me that you are a worthy paladin and a friend of the Deepwater Knights.  If you do so, then you must bring me four of the nets of the goblin fishermen in Lake Rathetear.  I will then give you the sacred molds for the Bracers of Ro.&quot;<br><br>I stood and saluted him.  &quot;I will not return until I have them.  Brell be with you, friend.&quot;<br><br>He saluted me in return.  &quot;And may Prexus keep you safe on your voyage to Odus, my young friend.&quot;<br><br>I stood, pulled on my pack, and headed east.

His name was Ryshon Hunsti.<br><br>During the course of our conversation he told me of a sword that was clearly magical and quite powerful.  He told me the name of a dwarf that lives near my home city of Kaladim.  I sought out this dwarf, and listened as he spun his tale of woe and lost friends.  <br><br>Over the course of several weeks I travelled all over Norrath seeking the ingredients to make this powerful sword.  A tall barbarian female named Ruathey had given me a magic bag in which to put the pieces I had collected.  Once they were all together, a magic phrase would assemble the various parts into the magic sword known as Ghoulbane.<br><br>The quest to assemble this sword took me all over Norrath.  After much effort, I collected all of the pieces and I had my sword.  Lighter than my father's sword (which requires me to use both hands), it was clearly a weapon that I could carry with a shield.  I realized that this was a great weapon I could use to further the cause of Brell Serilis and free those poor tormented souls that have been cursed into a wandering state by the forces of darkness.  <br><br>I spent several days planning my next journey and collecting supplies.  I had heard tales of a great dungeon hidden within the great Innothule Swamp that housed great numbers of Undead.

They were absolutely graceful.<br><br>I made my way south to the enormous lake in the south known as Rathetear.  There I discovered a large number of adventurers heading toward the Rathe Mountains.<br><br>I hailed one tall barbarian who was hurrying east.<br><br>&quot;Pardon a stranger for interrupting your journey,&quot; I said to him.  &quot;I have seen many travellers heading East to the mountains.  Are you going there?  What is it that you seek there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, my short friend, I am going to the mountains,&quot; the tall warrior replied.  &quot;The outposts have been attacked by an army of hill giants.  Many of us are going to their aid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I am yet too inexperienced to take on a giant but I am sure I can help in some way.  May I accompany you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Come along then if you can keep up,&quot; he replied with a grin. <br><br>After having been forced to swim part of the way, we arrived in the pass that led from the lake to the mountains.  A small army representing all the races of Norrath were there.  I saw many old familiar faces.<br><br>The fight was not going well.  Apparently the giants vastly outnumbered those opposing them and they had slaughtered many groups of travellers and adventurers as well as the people of the outposts.  <br><br>Looking at the large number of wounded lying in the pass, I took out my pack full of bandages.  &quot;I may not be able to fight a giant, but it is my duty to help those in need,&quot; I told my barbarian companion.  &quot;Fare thee well, friend!&quot;<br><br>The barbarian joined a group of powerful warriors and casters that was heading into the mountains.  He waved goodbye as they disappeared from sight.  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue May 14 09:15:07 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

I found my favorite fishing spot unoccupied and so I sat down to fish after puchasing a few bowls of worms for bait.  <br><br>I closed my eyes.  I was beginning to drift off to sleep when I heard a voice behind me.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me sir, but aren't you a member of the Knights of Shining Light?&quot;<br><br>I turned to see a young high elf in his distinctive green robe.  He seemed friendly enough even if he had interrupted my (almost) nap.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; I replied.  &quot;Is there something I can do for you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My name is Glitterhands.  I am an apprentice enchanter and jeweler.  I am offering my services to your guild, sir,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Are you someone I could speak to about joining or can you direct me to the correct person?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I am not in charge,&quot; I admitted.  &quot;But I can try to help out.  Let me send a letter of recommendation to the leaders of the guild and I promise to let you know when I receive a reply.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you sir.  You are most kind.&quot;  The elf bowed to me and wandered off to his own fishing spot nearby.<br><br>I returned to my spot and sat down.  I figured I would try to prepare some more food before my next adventure to Antonica.  Fish is always a good thing.  It preserved so well.  I wonder how my friend Boomba is doing?  Hopefully the Freeport Militia is not being too hard on him.<br><br>I frowned when I thought about that.  I had heard that they were led by a paladin who had become corrupted.  I wonder... could he be the same paladin that had betrayed my parents?  I had not thought of that possibility before.  I will have to find out more about this fellow, I decided.<br><br>My eyes began to droop again.  As I began to drift off to sleep I thought of beautiful young elves with their fair skin and their long hair and smiled.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Apr 18 15:42:03 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

For some reason they did not wave to me as they usually did. <br><br>&quot;What is wrong with you?  Are holy warriors of Brell no longer welcome among their own people?&quot;<br><br>One of the guards lifted his visor and squinted his eyes at me.  &quot;Gorfrey is that you?&quot; he said as he gave a hearty dwarf laugh.  &quot;I did not even recognize you.  I see you have picked up some new armor.&quot;<br><br>After a few minutes of socializing, I waved goodbye to my friends and started my way down the trail to Kaladim.  Well, I must look differently, I thought.  After all I AM wearing my new armor of Ro and my new coif I thought proudly before I realized what I was doing.  I shook my head.  Humility, humility, humility, I harangued myself.  I was proud of my new armor but I couldn't let it go to my head.<br><br>As I pondered this I heard some rustling noises on the path in front of me.  I instinctively put my hand on the pommel of my sword as I looked more closely for the source of the noise ahead of me.  Cowering under a bush in front of me was a small dwarf holding a rusty Stormguard axe.  He was very dirty (even for a dwarf) and had obviously been in the woods for some time.<br><br>&quot;Come out of there, you,&quot; I ordered.  &quot;Why do you have a Stormguard axe?&quot;  I suspiciously eyed the dwarf from head to toe.  &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br><br>The dwarf looked at me nervously, like a child that had been caught with its hand in the cookie jar.  &quot;Err... it's Blyle Bundin, my lord.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait a moment,&quot; I said.  &quot;You are that guard that deserted his post, aren't you?&quot;  I quickly drew my sword.  &quot;You must learn there is a penalty for desertion.&quot;  <br><br>&quot;No, please!&quot; the smaller dwarf squealed.  &quot;Can't we discuss this?!?&quot;  He backed away from me.<br><br>&quot;If all guards were like you, who would protect the city from the goblins and orcs, you little fool?&quot; I angrily replied.  &quot;If you were going to be so cowardly and careless enough to desert, you should have been smart enough to go somewhere far away where you would not get caught.&quot;<br><br>Bundin turned and ran.  &quot;Help, help!&quot;  he cried.  &quot;I am being attacked!  Someone save me!&quot;<br><br>Nearby, two other members of the Stormguard (who did not know me as well) heard the cries for help and ran down the path.<br><br>&quot;Stop, you!&quot; they yelled.  &quot;In the name of the King!&quot;  <br><br>&quot;Yes, come get him!' I replied.  I turned to see them coming and I smiled.  Then I realized that they were ignoring Bundin and were coming at me with axes at the ready.<br><br>&quot;Not ME, you brainless heaps of ogre dung!  HIM!&quot;<br>The guards nonetheless pounced on me as Bundin disappeared down the trail.<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Apr 18 09:56:05 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

I had heard the fishing here was good and that the opportunities for drinking were excellent.  What more could I want?  I thought to myself.  Aside from perhaps some female company.  I cringed at the thought of dirty hairy feet.  Well, maybe not.<br><br>After a short stay in Rivervale, I made my way across the plains of Karana and finally arrived in Qeynos.  Not quite as bustling as Freeport, Queynos was still an interesting city nonetheless.  <br><br>On my way back to Highpass Hold, I had an encounter on the road.  A striking tall human female stepped out onto the path.  <br><br>&quot;Hello, my lady,&quot; I said with a smile.  &quot;Is there something I can do for you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why yes,&quot; she said with a beautiful smile.  &quot;You can hand over your money purse.&quot;  <br><br>I quickly realized I was surrounded by a sizeable group of female thieves, all tall and attractive.  Who would have thought?  I admitted.  I sighed and shook my head.<br><br>&quot;I am sorry to do this, my lady,&quot; I admitted as I quickly drew my sword.<br><br>A short time later, I stood over the corpses of the four bandits.  They had hardly made a scratch on me.  I said a quick prayer of thanks to Brell and then another for the gods to pity their souls.<br><br>Humans, I thought.

I did not want these human and half-elf paladins to think that a dwarf was not dignified enough to meet with them.<br><br>&quot;Greetings, young paladin,&quot; said the tall human standing in front of me.  &quot;Do you know why you have been called before us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, my lord,&quot; I admitted.  &quot;I received a letter from Gunlok Jure, who instructed me to report here to you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, we have a letter from him as well,&quot; said another paladin, this one a human female.  &quot;He has told us who you are, and more importantly, who your father was.&quot;  She smiled knowingly.<br><br>&quot;You knew my father?&quot; I asked incredulously.  Now they had my attention.<br><br>&quot;A very powerful paladin, your father.  His name was Amaral Bellhewer.  We knew him because we fought at his side in many battles.  We have something that belonged to him.  It was his wish to pass it on to you when you were old enough and when you had earned the right to carry it as a holy warrior of renown.  You have recently helped slay Emperor Crush and many dozens of his minions.  For this, we think you are ready.&quot;<br><br>Another paladin walked up with a large box.  He opened it to reveal an enormous sword.<br><br>&quot;This belonged to your father.  It was forged long ago by the great blacksmiths of the Combine Empire.  With this weapon your father slew many a foe.  When he died he asked us to keep it for you so that you may have it when the time was right.&quot;<br><br>I stared at the weapon.  I was awed into silence.  I struggled to find the words to express what I felt.<br><br>&quot;I never knew my parents.  I never even knew their names.  What of my mother?&quot;<br><br>The two elder paladins looked at each other.  One nodded at the other before speaking.<br><br>&quot;Your mother was a great healer, Gorfrey,&quot; she said.  &quot;Her name was Jenette Bellhewer.  She had gone to try to resurrect your father after he fell in battle.  No one ever saw either one of them again.  We are truly sorry.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly I felt strangely.  I had always believed that I had become a paladin by accident rather than by fate.  What did all of this mean?<br><br>&quot;I too wish to be great, as my parents were before me,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wish to earn a place by the side of Brell Serilis.  What must I do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is for you to figure out for yourself, young paladin,&quot; the male human said with a smile.  &quot;But know this - we believe your parents' deaths were a deliberate act of one of our order who betrayed them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And betrayed us as well,&quot; the female added.  &quot;We will tell you more when the time comes and you are ready.  For now, you must seek out evil wherever it lies.  Your heart is pure, although not perfect.  Follow your own conscience and see where it takes you.  That is all for now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fare thee well, fellow paladin,&quot; they said before they turned and left the room.<br><br>I walked outside.  The cool night air and the sound of running water were soothing to me as I thought about all I had learned. I studied the schools of small minnows swimming about.<br><br>&quot;I will find my parents.  Brell help me, I will find them and give them a proper burial if I cannot have them raised from the dead.  And I will find those responsible for their deaths.&quot;<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Sep  7 14:16:44 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

Perhaps the most horrible of all these, and the most tragic as well, is Equestrielle.  At one time she was a beautiful unicorn that dwelled in the forest with the other unicorns.  Until someone took her horn, and with it went everything about her that was pure and full of joy.  Evil so corrupted her that her very color changed from white to a dark black.  Now she travels throughout the forest wreaking havoc on all who are unfortunate enough to cross her path.<br><br>Including me.  And my companions.<br><br>I do not remember much that happened that night.  We had let our guard down and suddenly she appeared.  She killed us all in less time that it takes Furtog Ogrebane to down a mead.  <br><br>Although I hunt the undead, I do not hate them.  I pity them.  They cannot help it that the forces of darkness have raised them from the dead and twisted their rotting bodies for their own foul purposes.  Their souls are in torment and it is my duty to free them.  <br><br>I think perhaps this analogy can be extended to this poor creature of the forest.  After I was raised from the dead I vowed that when able I would return to the Faydark with the express purpose of putting this suffering animal out of its misery.  <br><br>I pray to Brell that it will not be long.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Apr  4 10:20:21 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

It has nothing to do with you.  Can we be just friends?&quot;<br><br>I cursed myself for letting that female distract me from my true purpose.  She was just so willowy and seductive.  She was full of life and happiness, but there was no real purpose or direction in her life other than her insistence on living in the moment.  I sighed.  It is just as well, I thought.   I cleared my thoughts of the sultry wood elf out of my head and decided to focus on the matter at hand.  I was on my way to a guild meeting near Freeport.  I was already wondering if I was going to be late.  <br><br>Ahead of the ship dark clouds were looming.  How appropriate, I thought.  The sea is in tune with my dark mood.  Thunder rolled in from the west.  <br><br>&quot;You best be heading below, young paladin,&quot; a sailor warned me.  &quot;It is going to get rough soon.&quot;  He grinned. &quot;I hope you haven't got a full stomach.  I remember the last time we hit a storm with you on board.&quot; <br><br>The memory of that little incident made me queasy.  I groaned.  <br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

I could see Trumpy was grinning from ear to ear.  I guess the money he was making would more than make up for the cost of new furniture.<br><br>I stood nervously by the bar.  I was waiting for Cleonae to show up.  She was supposed to meet me here and had not yet arrived.  <br><br>&quot;Well, do my eyes deceive me?  Is that the little tyke I used to know?&quot; the bellowing voice of Furtog Ogrebane called out behind me.<br><br>I turned and saluted him.  The grizzled old warrior walked up and playfully punched me in the shoulder.  &quot;How about treating your old friend to a few ales?&quot;  <br><br>&quot;Another round over here, Trumpy,&quot; I called out to the proprietor.  He obliged me by bringing four tankards over to the table.  Furtog gleefully grabbed one and downed it before Trumpy had even set them all down.  <br><br>&quot;I hear you got rid of those two ogres, Corflunk and Zarchoomi,&quot; Furtog said with a grin.  &quot;Gunlok has trained you well.  For a worthless paladin.&quot; he said with a jest.  <br><br>&quot;Yes, although it took me a while to find Zarchoomi.  Byzar said he didn't want just one head, so I had to keep Corflunk's head until I got hers as well.  It was nice and ripe by the time I was able to turn both of them in.  The dwarves at the bank were not happy with me.  They said it will take some time to get the stink out of the vault.  I even had to get them to replace my deposit box.&quot;<br><br>By this time, Furtog had downed all of the ales I had just bought, even the one I had started drinking myself.  He then proceeded to take two more off the table next to us.  <br><br>&quot;What are you doing, you thoughtless fool?&quot;  the dwarf at the table said with a start.  He and his buxom but heavily bearded date did not look happy. <br><br>Furtog jumped out of his chair and slugged the dwarf square in the face, knocking him backward so hard that the chair underneath him broke into three pieces.  The dwarf's female companion proceeded to grab her own chair and break it over Furtog's head.<br><br>&quot;Here we go again,&quot; I groaned.  <br><br>Just then, a beautiful young elf strode through the door.  She had just taken off her cloak as an empty Kalish bottle went sailing past her.  She ducked and then looked at me in wonder.<br><br>&quot;Umm... maybe we should try going somewhere else,&quot; I offered to her.  &quot;This place is getting a little rowdy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think that would be a good idea,&quot; Cleonae replied.  The two of us walked out the door just as the last of the furniture was turned into flying splinters against the far wall.  We picked up our pace as we headed down the tunnel.  The sound of breaking glass and dwarven profanity slipped away.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

Normally I studied the crowd carefully as I walked through the city.  However, today the endless sea of strangers swirled around me unnoticed as I sampled the latest culinary creation of the smiling ogre that towered over me.  Who would have imagined that a dwarf and an ogre would get along so well? I thought with an inward chuckle.<br><br>&quot;Boomba,&quot; I said, &quot;no one makes pickles like you.  Not even me.&quot;  I smiled at the ogre, who seemed pleased.  I took another bite of the pickled pixie.  Delicious!<br><br>&quot;Me make good pickle, yes?&quot;  he replied with a toothy grin.  He walked over to his kettle where he was working on yet another batch of pickles.  &quot;Me like you, Gorfrey.  Me show you how make you pickles better.&quot;  He suddenly stopped and eyed me suspiciously.  &quot;You no try to steal Boomba's business?&quot;<br><br>I shook my head and laughed.  &quot;Boomba, you know I could never make pickles as good as yours.  Besides, I don't think many of the locals like me as much as you.  You're a real institution around here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What dat?&quot;  Boomba scratched his head at my big words.<br><br>&quot;People know you, Boomba, and they like you.  I just don't see myself selling dwarf pickles or paladin pickles.&quot; I said half jokingly, half seriously.  &quot;Now, what's your secret ingredient for the bixie pickles?  Come on, you can tell me -I will keep it to myself.  I'll even give you some of my recipes in trade.&quot;<br><br>Boomba scratched his head again, looking about as thoughtful as was possible for an ogre.  &quot;Me like you snake pickles.  You show Boomba how make snake pickles, me show you how make bixie pickles.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Deal,&quot; I said with a handshake.  This place really isn't so bad, I thought to myself.  Too bad the Militia has control over most of the city.  Their corruption was rampant and widespread.  I had even heard stories about how members of the militia worked with the dark races to overthrow the paladins and clerics in the Northern Freeport.  If they succeeded, what would happen to Boomba and all the other honest merchants?  I shuddered at the thought.<br><br>&quot;I will see you again soon, Boomba.  Remember, the pickles taste better when you wash your hands more often,&quot; I sternly reminded him.<br><br>Boomba rolled his eyes at me.  &quot;Boomba hands no dirty,&quot; he said as I watched him scratch himself in a very personal place, and then start stirring his pickle pot again.  I cringed.  My stomach started to rebel. I have to remember not to buy any of the next batch of orc pickles, I thought.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Mar 27 09:00:57 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

I had only been here once before and it was a difficult place to find.<br><br>There! I thought as I spied the gaping rectangular hole that marked the passageway.  Found it!<br><br>I stood up and made my way down the dune to the cave entrance.  Standing there waiting for me was an old friend.<br><br>&quot;Hail, Texxan, and well met!&quot; I clasped the hand of the towering human.<br><br>&quot;It has been a long time, my short friend,&quot; said Texxan with a smile.  &quot;How have you been?&quot;  <br><br>I shrugged.  &quot;As well as can be expected, considering the circumstances.  I recently left my guild.  I was facing expulsion anyway.  And yet, it still feels strange, as if I had failed somehow.&quot;  My voice trailed off. <br><br>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; the taller paladin said with authority.  &quot;You have not failed.  Those of us who wished to continue together have formed a new guild.&quot;  Texxan paused.  &quot;We would like you to join us.  We know your heart is good.  We may not serve the same gods, you and I, but we serve the same purpose.  Those of us who seek to rid Norrath of evil should always work together.&quot;<br><br>I nodded thoughtfully.  &quot;I think something had happened to the leadership of the Legions of Might.  What was it?  Ambition?  Greed?  When did the attainment of titles and material things become more important than serving the needs of others?  I don't understand.&quot; I lamented.  <br><br>&quot;Many of us had seen this coming, sadly enough,&quot; said Texxan with a pained look on his scarred but still handsome face.  &quot;We did what we could to try to prevent it, but it was to no avail.  Still, there is much work for us to do.  We must press on and put the pettiness of these things behind us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; I agreed with newly found purpose.  &quot;Which brings us here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Grettings, old friend,&quot; said another voice in the shadows of the cave.  &quot;Are you ready to cleanse this place of the undead and their evil masters?  There are many souls here to be freed.&quot;<br><br>My jaw dropped.  &quot;Faeelan, is that you?&quot;  I said with astonishment.  &quot;Great Brell, I have not seen you in many seasons!&quot;  <br><br>The second human paladin smiled.  &quot;It is good to see you again, Gorfrey.  Will you join us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, by Brell's might, yes!  When do we begin?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;Soon.  The rest of the guild will be here soon and we will organize ourselves into several parties of five or six apiece.  I think you will see a great many familiar faces, my friend,&quot; said Texxan with a smile.   &quot;Consider yourself a member of the Knights of Shining Light from this day forward.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am in your debt, my old friends.  Thank you for this new chance to prove myself.&quot;  I knew I would not let them down.  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Mar 20 23:16:46 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

If I am to train you how to parry you are going to have to move much faster.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, master,&quot; I replied.  By now sweat was pouring off me.  <br><br>&quot;I am sure you would rather have me train you how to parry than have some dark elf do it, yes?&quot; the senior dwarf said seriously.<br><br>&quot;Of course, master.  I will try harder.&quot;  I offered as I raised my sword again, showing I was ready.<br><br>This went on for some time, until Gunlok Jure finally felt satisfied enough with my progress to let me rest.  <br><br>Sitting down to eat in the great hall, the paladin trainer looked at me and shook his head.  &quot;You have much to learn, Gorfrey.  Much more training and experience you need.  And have you practiced your blacksmithing?  Or your brewing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, master,&quot; I confessed.  &quot;I have been working on other things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What other things?&quot; he asked.  &quot;What could be more important to a dwarf than brewing and blacksmithing?&quot;  His eyes narrowed.  &quot;What have you been doing when not fighting?&quot;<br><br>I am sure I must have looked a little nervous.  I cannot fool this dwarf.  <br><br>&quot;Well, master, I have been fishing a lot... and making arrows and bows.  And also...&quot; I hesitated, dreading telling him what I had been doing.<br><br>&quot;Also what?&quot; his eyes narrowed.  <br><br>&quot;Cooking, master.&quot; <br><br>Gunlok choked on his ale.  Spitting it out on the floor, he gasped &quot;What?!?  You have been COOKING?!?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, master.&quot;  My shoulders sank at his reaction.  &quot;I thought I would be more self-sufficient in my travels if I did not have to depend on others for food.  You know I have bad experiences at inns for some reason.  And Cleonae likes my cooking&quot;  My eyes briefly went wide when I realized my confession.  <br><br>Gunlok sank back into his chair.  He audibly sighed as he stared at me.  I stared at the floor.<br><br>&quot;Gorfrey, the life of a paladin is not easy.  One must make sacrifices if you are to be a true servant of Brell Serilis.  I agree one must be self-sufficient in many respects.  However, spending a lot of time with a female... cooking for her,&quot; he said with a disapproving tone, &quot;will not help you make your way down the path to becoming a true holy warrior.&quot;<br><br>I must have been visibly saddened, for Gunlok sighed again and gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder.<br><br>&quot;I have seen your bow.  You have become very skilled in bowyering.  It is truly a fine weapon,&quot; he agreed.  &quot;However, I am unsettled by your lack of interest in these other important dwarven skills.  You must resolve to practice them more often.  Being able to forge your own armor and weapons will be important later in your life.&quot;<br><br>I nodded silently in agreement.  The older and wiser dwarf handed me another tankard of ale.  <br><br>&quot;Now, you are ready to go out into the world again.  Return to me after another season and we will see how you have improved.&quot;<br><br>I nodded again.  &quot;I will do my best, master.&quot;<br><br>&quot;By the way, who is Cleonae?&quot; Gunlok inquired.  &quot;Such an unusual name for a dwarf.&quot;<br><br>Now it was my turn to choke on my ale.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Mar  5 09:47:28 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

I had spent many months in the common lands and deserts of Antonica.  It is a large continent, much bigger than Faydwer,  and although I marvel at its beauties and wondrous creatures, I am always glad to be home.  I dropped my packs and weapons in front of the bar.  Dust and sand scattered across the floor.<br><br>&quot;Well, it is young Gorfrey again... we had wondered if a griffin had carried you away.  You want your usual?&quot;  The barkeep offered a mischievous grin.<br><br>&quot;Absolutely, my usual,&quot; I laughed as I clapped him on the shoulder, knowing that my usual way of ordering ale was &quot;something cold and alcoholic, if you please&quot;. <br><br>Handing me a foaming tankard of dwarven ale, he said &quot;Made this batch m'self... oh, there was someone lookin' fer you earlier... a courier or messenger of some type.&quot;<br><br>Just then a young dwarf burst into the tavern, breathlessly announcing he had a message for Gorfrey.  I took the scroll with the wax seal of the Legions of Might from him and opened it up, wondering what sort of message from the guild could be so important.<br><br>It was a letter from the leadership of my guild, the Legions of Might.  It informed me that many of the younger members of the guild, including myself, were facing expulsion.  I was absolutely stunned.  What had I done to deserve this?  What had any of us done?  Why were we suddenly deemed unworthy of association with these elder citizens of Norrath?  Was it something we had failed to do?  Placing my silver on the bar, I left without a word.  I am sure my expression spoke volumes.  My mind reeling and my mood plummeting, I wandered outside of the city to sit and think.  <br><br>Having been an orphan, I realized that the thought of losing the only family I have ever known is perhaps more than I can bear.  <br><br>Not knowing what else to do, I buckled on my armor, checked my packs, and sharpened my sword.  I decided that if there was any doubt that I was not worthy of the Legion of Might, I would have to make sure that it was erased.  I decided that I will prove myself a worthy servant of Brell Serilis, and hope that it would prove my worth to my fellow members of the Guild as well. <br><br>As I hurried past the guard hut, one of them called out &quot;Where are ye goin' in such a big hurry?

I would run through the mines chasing rats and watching the miners at their work.  Once while chasing a rat I fell into the water in the mines.  I was horrified, not only at the fact that I could not swim, but also at the terrible similarity between swimming and bathing.  However, necessity overruled my baser instincts and I found myself taking the time to learn to swim, even when fully clothed.  I quickly discovered that learning to swim made me more acceptable of the idea of bathing, much to my surprise.  I also discovered that bathing made me more acceptable to many elves, particularly of the female persuasion.<br><br>Sometimes I wonder how I did not become a thief.  Poverty can be a terrible handicap, especially when one has little purpose or direction in life to offset it.  <br><br>Not having anything better to do, I decided to leave my home city and explore Faydwer.<br><br>As a young dwarf, I witnessed a terrible sight - another young dwarf being attacked and killed by a group of skeletons.  I had never seen such a horrible and bloody sight.  It was then that I realized my true calling in life.  I vowed to myself and to Brell Serilis that I would dedicate my life to the extermination of the undead and the overthrow of evil.<br><br>I had two exceptional teachers that trained me.  The first was a fellow dwarf named Gunlok Jure in the Underfoot Citadel.  He encouraged me in my quest against the undead by giving me advice, training, weapons, armor, money and anything else he could spare to help me.  I owe him a great debt for his generosity and careful instruction.<br><br>The second and most unusual fellow who helped me was an elf named General Jyleel Vad.  This fellow holy warrior encouraged me to not forget that the orcs were also making massive inroads into both Faydwer and the Butcherblock Mountains, theatening both the elves and the dwarves.  I have frequently told that although I drink like a dwarf, I speak like an elf.  For this, I can thank the General for his personal instruction on diction and grammar.  His efforts to transform an unkempt young dwarf into a polished holy knight of Brell Serilis have so far been largely successful.  He has even managed to help me control my temper and my profanity, something which I may never have managed otherwise.  <br><br>Thus have I become unusual in my speech, my personal habits, and in my choice of associates.  However, I have not forgotten who I am.  I am a dwarf.  I will always be a dwarf.  <br><br>Brell be praised.  Pass the ale!<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Feb 20 11:38:07 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>

Kelethin has some great taverns, where the service is good and the variety of brews is wide.  All Kelethin really needs is a good place to go fishing.  Felwithe has stunning architecture, a Paladin guild where I am welcomed as a brother, and of course the fishing is good. <br><br>Of course, being of an age when I am beginning to think of such things, I find myself drawn to the beautiful and nubile young elf maidens in these cities.  Is it wrong?  Is it weak?  I do not know the answer.  I pray for guidance and hope that I do not stray from my path of holy combat in the name of Brell Serilis.  Perhaps, when my beard has grayed and I no longer have the strength to buckle on my armor, I will think about settling down.<br><br>Such foolish thoughts.

The ride was not pleasant, particularly since it stormed almost the entire voyage.  <br><br>After several days I arrived in Freeport.  I am always impressed with the sheer size and business of this human city.  I wandered over to the Theater of the Tranquil, wherethe ceremony was about to begin. It was a magnificent spectacle.  Dozens of members of the Legions of Might were in attendance for the wedding of two of our own: Texxan and Xavieras.  Being of short stature (of course), I proceeded to find a spot in front where I could see clearly.  The ceremony was short, which was good, as I could hear the ales in my backpack sloshing around as I squirmed with impatience.  <br><br>After the ceremony was over, there was much dancing and drinking.  Not having much use for dancing, I proceeded to consume a large amount of beer, ale, wine, and anything else I could get my hands on.  It was a grand time.<br><br>But enough of that.  There was much work to be done.  I proceeded to the Commonlands, where I had heard there was a large population of undead that needed to have their souls released.  I am just the dwarf for the job.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Feb 12 10:29:56 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, <br>Knights of Shining Light<br>Paladin of the 48th Quest, <br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 25th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br></td></td></tr>
