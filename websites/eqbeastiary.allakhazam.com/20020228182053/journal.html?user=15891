Not long after his birth, Nathanial's parents adopted another boy, Mycah.  Mycah was a sickly child, and always very pale in complexion, but the truth of his mysterious origins wouldn't come to light until adolescence, when Mycah's skin began turning a telltale shade of blue.  And then there's the odd tale of the family "pet", the Leafcat.  When the brownies did finally lay waste to the elvish communities of the Lesser Fay, the brothers were separated and grew into distinctly different lives, certainly shaped by the brutal murder of their parents.  Communication between the two brothers is rare, each having his own agenda with the other, and as for the Leafcat?  His role may turn out to be the most bizarre of all.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center>

Pusbag...<br><br>I have received your message.&nbsp;&nbsp;It arrived just this morning in Shadow Haven, and while those sour-faced guards were obviously remiss to hand over the mail, I had only days before registered as a member of the city in good standing, so deliver it they did.  <br><br>Your message was both troubling and mysterious.  Surely you are a friend of my brother, Mycah.  At least you present yourself in a similar manner.  &quot;Supremacy over all of Norrath&quot; this, &quot;Secret desires for dominion over others&quot; that...  Aye.  It sounds vaguely familiar.  <br><br>I would have to respectfully decline this invitation, citing that I already am guilded in the High Order of Lanys, the Kelethin Ranger's Guild, Gilbo's Tailoring Squad, Murphy's Baking Club, and Raphelio's Tuesday Night Gems Brigade.  As it is, I have so very little time left to actually DOMINATE the world, my energies I'm afraid are spent.<br><br>Indeed your name has now been written on a list of people that, should we meet somewhere in Norrath or on the moon, I shall thank you in person for your kind invitation and likely then turn you in to the nearest justicar of the peace.<br><br>Might I direct your attention to my brother, Mycah, however?  You seem a perfect fit for him.  In fact comments like &quot;rule with an iron hand&quot;, &quot;darkness calls to you&quot;, and &quot;you worthless cattle&quot; are much more suited to the kind of company he keeps.  After all, no one should be alone in this world, be ye an agent of Tunare or an agent of the very devil himself.  I wish you the best of luck in both your quest for supreme leadership over the planet as *well* as your ability to avoid me in the near future.  <br><br>Cheerio!<br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It's been a while.<br><br>Here's an update.<br><br>Leafbringer Nathanial - 53 Ranger<br>---------------------------------<br>Leafbringer, after much exploring, dying, grouping, dying, camping, dying and other Rangerly things (dying), has found a region of the moon that he has decided to call home.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maiden's Eye has provided ample experience and loot (including a Centi Longsword, a finely crafted thing that fits snugly into Leaf's offhand, a pair of boots ac12 all stats 4 cha5, jus something nice to have tho I prefer my planar, a Goranga Idol ac8 and a few stats I can't recall - finally a ranger-usable range slot item that isn't a bow or a ball of velium, among some other assorted stuff)...  Leaf also has been questing a bit here and there, and in so doing has also acquired a weapon he's -very- proud of - the Longsword of Ethereal Energy.  This was a quest most people became aware of pretty quickly and definitely took advantage of the ease of it- in fact thanks to the Centi Longsword and the LSoEE, the 1hs market has become a bit... goofy.  The LSoEE has a host of stats and when combined with haste, a (newly acquired) FBSS and the Centi in the offhand, well... Leaf is a killing machine now.  Definitely enough to tide him over until he gets his epics.  Leafbringer is still pending membership in a great guild called Forgotten Horde &lt;see post below&gt; - they are hard to get into - that's half of the reward if and when you finally do get in - but raiding with them has been fun... so far Leaf has joined them in Hate a few times, partied here and there with several of their members... they -are- good.  Going to Fear with them in a few days.  <br><br>Leaf is feeling mighty nowadays.  He's acquired 53 (very nearly 54 now), and his abilities seemed to grow exponentially with 53.  Jolt is becoming an almost overused spell at this point, with the promise at 54 of a Jolt-proc effect spell for his weaponry.  It's very necessary for keeping the aggro off with the amount of damage being done now (in both directions).<br><br>Leafbringer never did have a reunion with the Leafcat.  He arrived in Shar Vahl, was greeted warmly, and spent four days searching the city, asking questions, getting used to the idea of a whole race of huge cat people.  He had always known there was something... magical about his pet cat, but now that he was fully aware that the cat had likely -always- had near-elf intelligence, he had to think long and hard on what reasons Leafcat might have had to act like a regular cat all those years.  But any hope of speaking to the cat about these things were dashed when Leafbringer realized that the odors of the cat, even small signs that he had even been to Shar Vahl yet, were long gone.  The bard's guild provided the most information.  Leafcat Panthyrsong had been there, purchased some sheet music, and was gone.  To the officers of the place he was just any other member of the guild, origins largely unknown, destination largely unknown.  Leafbringer would continue the hunt...<br><br>Mycah Leafdefiler, 39 Enchanter<br>-------------------------------<br>Yes, still 39.  Leafbringer has been garnering the most attention of late.  There's just something about those 50's that make you want 60 pretty badly.<br><br>Mycah also took a fantastic journey to the moon, but, for better or for worse, more accurately hunted the Leafcat.  While the enchanter certainly had none of the faculties of a ranger, he had something Leafbringer didn't have - inside information.  After keeping the dwarf tied to the ceiling by his beard for six hours, the Coldain merchant almost with glee admitted having sold items to the Leafcat, asking about his plans, and being told to tell nobody that he'd be making the journey to the Dreadlands via teleport, and from there a short run to the spires which would take him to the moon.  Mycah yanked the dwarf down by an ankle, content with the ripping sound the beard made, the squeal, the thud, the echo through this deserted tunnel in the Crystal Caverns.  Mycah waved his skeletal hand (the illusion had -really- frightened the dwarf, but as most dwarves are good for their word it -still- took a considerable amount of time to shake the info out) in front of the moaning captive, and the dwarf's pain-filled eyes suddenly changed and looked like the eyes of a doe.  He turned, absentmindedly tugging at a beard that wasn't there anymore, and ambled off, lost... dazed... confused... surely late for supper...<br><br>Mycah was only a half-day behind the cat and could bridge that gap with a few incantations.  The Lake of Ill Omen had served as home for so long that Mycah had grown literally attached to the place.  Any such place was easily reachable via the soul.  Spending an hour concentrating intently on the view of the spinning mill, when next Mycah opened his eyes, the real image of the spinning mill was before him.  From here the travel to the Dreadlands would be quick.  <br><br>Sure enough, upon arriving at the famous spires of the autumn-land, Mycah noted that there were literally dozens of people standing around, talking, cavorting, passing the time as they waited for the magicks to sweep them away to the moon.  Amongst these people were several large, obviously intelligent cats.  Among these cats was Leafcat, known better to Mycah for many years as Panthyrsong... thought to be a pet.  Ha.  Hardly.  The very thought now seemed insane as Mycah invisibly watched his &quot;pet&quot; show a few people some card tricks, play a few tunes on a mandolin, and tell several jokes, at least one of which appeared to be funny.  It would be unwise to challenge the cat outright, right here.  The time would come when the cat would be alone.  His fate would then be sealed.  The cat knew too much and he had a tendency to meddle.  He would be a thorn for a long time if he wasn't plucked soon.<br><br>Leafcat Panthyrsong, 17 Bard<br>----------------------------<br>meow.  meowmeow meowmeow meow.  meow.  meowmeow meow meow meowmeow.  meowmeow meow meowwwwwwww meow meowww meow meowmeowmeow meowwwwwww.<br><br>(sung to the tune of something quite familiar)  <br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Happy New Year!<br><br>Leafbringer Nathanial, Pathfinder of the 52nd Season<br><br>Leaf came to the knowledge in quite a shocking way that there were now portals in Norrath which took you to the moon Luclin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The night he was awoken by the fading notes of Panthyrsong, Leaf did a thorough search of the area.  Amongst the pine needles and half-sticking out of a clump of snow was a slab of some hard stone substance (Acrylia, he'd later find out) with unmistakable writing on it.  It was indeed the etchings of the Leafcat.  The writing, perfect Common, said simply to meet the cat in a place called Shar Vahl.  That this place was reachable by crossing the Dreadlands into the hidden valley where the ancient spires sit.  While Leafbringer had made this short but dangerous journey many times in his life, this time was the first that a Scion stood in the ring of magicks.  Leafbringer introduced himself and was provided a gemstone and the suggestion to sit around a few minutes and enjoy the moon.  The moon indeed.  When it came to be true moments later, Leafbringer was certainly taken aback.  The angry buzz of crackling magick fire shook him from his daze and he could hear the telltale energy snaps of spires in almost every direction around him.  The place was bustling with activity and there were people everywhere, many just having completed a gate from somewhere or other.  The heavy stench of ozone was almost overpowering.  Nathanial began a very epic journey through these new lands.  The hunt for the Leafcat was on.<br><br>Mycah Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter of the 39th Circle<br><br>Mycah had sat dormantly in the cold of the Crystal Caverns for far too long.  After awakening from a troubled, nightmare-filled sleep only to find his eyes itching and burning from some youthful allergy and a large cat print next to his pillow, it didn't take long for Mycah to realize who had stopped by.  The notion that it was the Leafcat who had hovered over him in his sleep, further insulting Mycah by leaving him alive, was enough.  But the slab of what surely was Acrylia sitting propped-up on a nearby stalagmite was the clincher.  It read, &quot;The time for your end is beginning, Defiler.  Remember me?&quot;  Mycah's hand instictively went to the back of his head.  There his fingers traced a line around the nape of us neck, up into his short black hair, and settled on a long series of raised welts.  If Mycah's hair was removed, the very distinctive scars of four long claws would be revealed, knotted and gnarled with age.  Mycah peered at the acrylia slab, where just below the scratched writing were five long claw gashes.  So the rumors of acrylia were true.  Thus the moon Luclin DID exist and was reachable from Norrath via the spires.  Mycah knew that now was the time to move.  That the cat wouldn't play with his prey long... and it was hunt or be hunted starting this day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Having just seen the first of the Lord of the Rings movies &quot;Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, I'm properly inspired to play EverQuest.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't take a genius to note that all things fantasy spring from this series (including everything from Dungeons and Dragons, to Magic: the Gathering, to EverQuest) and everything betwixt and between.  The problem is that I'm miles from home, currently in a little dot in Kansas, somewhere way down here by Arkansas, visiting the family for the holidays, and I'm not going to get my fix for at least three days (gasp).  Nearly all races were properly represented in this polished movie, and the rangers did me proud especially.  Truly the end of the movie leaves you hanging and begging for the next installment, and it will be a full year before getting -that- fix.  As an EverQuester to fellow EverQuesters - see this movie, do not pass GO, do not collect 200 platinum - just see this movie.  It's long (aren't all movies now?), so prepare for that, but also prepare for probably the FIRST truly wonderful adaptation of a classic fantasy novel to the big screen.  Kudos to a great cast (Gandalf is the bomb, literally, pointy hats off to Sir Ian McKellan, who in my mind can do no wrong), great direction, and miles of eye candy.<br><br>And Merry Christmas to you.  =)<br><br>(happy anniversary on my 100th post - heh)<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Dec 25 10:31:19 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Leafbringer for the first time since leaving his old family, Nine Realms, has found a guild suitable to his needs and desires.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such he has sent to them word of his interest and is awaiting word back.  Some time back, when Nathanial was just getting his feet wet fighting monsters tougher than the average named orc, the Nine Realms family had included a monk by the name of Holikao.  Holikao was an incredible monk, and it wasn't long before the Lanys Coalition of Guilds was using him endlessly for pulling the most dreadful and fearsome of creatures.  No matter where I saw Holi yanking monsters by the neck to his waiting group, be it Fear, Hate, Karnor's Castle, Sebelis, he always did so nearly flawlessly.  I saw him fall once.  Once.  Well, Holikao took absence of Nine Realms about a month before Leafbringer did, and joined a more robust clan called Forgotten Horde.  While Leaf missed partying consistently with Holi, it wasn't long before he also knew it was time to move on, but he wasn't sure where to move on TO.  Leaf's nearly aimless wanderings finally concluded in the halls of the Forgotten Horde, filling out a sheet of parchment exclaiming his interests in joining this clan.<br><br>Whether he is accepted or not is not the issue.  The fact that Leafbringer has finally come to the realization that the worlds of Norrath and Luclin are simply too harsh to go alone, is important, and it's a big step, one that took at least a small amount of courage. <br><br>This journal will be updated with any response Leaf might get, any ensuing raids or gatherings that may occur, and certainly any news of acception or declination.<br><br>====<br><br>Edit 12/22/01<br>If anyone is interested in following the progress of my possible initiation into this guild, the link is here <a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/fforgottenhorde32825frm2.showMessage?topicID=15.topic" target=_new>http://pub21.ezboard.com/fforgottenhorde32825frm2.showMessage?topicID=15.topic</a><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Dec 22 11:07:55 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Are you of the tree clan?&nbsp;&nbsp;Your name sounds familiar.  I'm Orinn Filcher, grumpy old elf of the old woods they call me.  And you raise a good point.  I was there to see those boys grow up, I only just escaped Thistle Underbrush and his band of devils myself, tho I lost my dear wife Lillian.  Mycah is to be watched, let me tell you that right now.  He ain't right and never has been, and I knew it from the get go.  First word I ever heard him utter was &quot;fu........&quot; nay I can't repeat it here, but let me just say he's more in tune to the dark side than he is anything of the forest, and oh how he troubled his dear ma.  If he wasn't sick in bed (or pretending to be so, Tunare only knows what he did hour after hour in his treecottage), then he was out collecting components and talking to the few brownies in the area at the time.  Silas Broodstick says Mycah may even have had a hand in helping orchestrate the brownie takeover, and for a long time I couldn't possibly give that sick waif credit for such lunacy.  Nowadays tho and in thinking back I see it's possible.  And then his relationship with his brother ... that was an odd one.  Nathanial was always a good boy and no doubt is a good man somewhere now, but he was far too compliant to the wills of his brother.  Mycah would send Nathan out all over the Lesser Fay looking for regeants for this, components for that... I'll never forget the day Nathanial returned with a moldy old skull, which the two boys proudly stuck on top of a stick, laughing and calling it ... oh .... my memory fails me now, I'm over 300 you know ... well it doesn't matter what they named it, the point is that skull wasn't just a deer skull or a spider carapace, that was a HUMAN skull, and while they had their parents convinced it was a fake skull crafted of lime rock and clay, I may be an old man losing his mind, but not his hearing and I know it was a real skull.  I worried over Mycah and his hold on Nathanial that whole time I lived in the treecottage just a few branches down - you see, I *SAW* the looks the two exchanged, but more importantly, I saw the look Mycah had when his brother wasn't around.  Oh yeah.  He had his brother convinced that everything was fun and games, but late at night there was no doubt in my mind that Mycah was weaving dark magicks over that ungodly skulled staff.  In any case, it's all long over now and my role in it all is done.  But to hear his name brought up here and worse yet to hear someone share the fear that Mycah may yet have cantankerous designs on his elder brother, well....  it just pains me because that family suffered enough loss already.  All I can hope is that Mycah is locked away in some institution somewhere and that Leafbringer is bringing him skulls there to whittle.  <br><br>That reminds me how all this truly got started in my mind again.<br><br>That CAT.  That damn weird, freaky ....  cat.  Sure it was too big to be a domesticated thing.  Didn't bother the Leaf family none.  They kept it anyway, and surely the boys took to it.  But good lord that thing got big, and there was something just not... right about it.  We all thought so.  Think the first real sign of tomfoolery was when my dear Lillian one night put out a bowl of batmilk for it (Panther's what they called it I think but everyone called it the Leafcat), and she did this acuz she had made that bowl with her own two hands and was awful proud that she had, and I think more than anything she wanted, well you know, she wanted the neighbors to see that she had a hobby and one she wasn't bad at, and oh I ramble so... well and anyway the next day the bowl was empty but there was a note there, written in some mighty peculiar script, that said ..... &quot;thanks for the milk&quot;.  Well, certainly we didn't think the CAT wrote it, but see there again now that I look back on things, I doubt nothin no more.  Well so anyway last night I was cookin up some of my famous grits and lo and behold there at the door was a knock - well, I went to see and when I opened the door, there was that bowl.  I about had a heart attack then and there.  I hadn't thought of that bowl in ages and there it was.  Once I got over the sadness it brought, and the memories, I started to really wonder what was up and so I came here and... well... I guess anyway that's about all I had to say and now I've said it.  But you watch out for those two boys and especially the blue one.  I think he's got it in for his brother sure as the sun rises I do, and now that you've said it too I'm more sure still.  I'll disappear now back into my world and think as little on this as I can, and people won't be thinking much on me neither (I'm no hero, I'm just an old lonely elf who's sole pride is his grits and now a bowl on a table), but I tell you there's real drama with that Leaf family. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Last night Leafbringer awoke to the sound of the Leafcat.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was unmistakable, although it had been years since Leaf had heard this absolutely unique noise.  Half-purring, half-singing, the melody ended as soon as Leaf was fully awake.  There was no odor in the air of anything other than the pine and berry trees of the Dreadlands, and while Leaf isn't convinced what he heard is truly what he heard, a shrill shiver remains now in his spine.<br><br>=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br><br>In the dripping confines of the Crystal Caverns, the very same night, Mycah awoke with a short scream locked in his throat.  The Leafdefiler felt as though he'd just awakened from a horrid nightmare, and while this was not odd, nor even unusual, the huge footprint of a cat (lion?  tiger?  some unknown beast?) next to his pillow in the dirt certainly was.  Mycah's eyes were itching, too, an allergic reaction Mycah hadn't experienced since.... since when??  Since... childhood?  What was it that caused his eyes to burn so?  He couldn't remember.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>(an aside to say thanks for the kind words i've received about this journal, i must say there are a LOT of very talented writers out there, and a lot of really creative minds plunking down journal stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm writing less and less probably because i'm so busy reading more and more! haha)<br><br>================================================<br><br>A good deal of time has once again passed in the world of Norrath.  And as with every passage of time in that place, the changes that have occurred recently have been nothing short of monumental.  Here's a recap.<br><br>Apparently a spell has lifted over Norrath beacuse suddenly people left and right are seeing each other with new clarity and detail.  To see Leafbringer and Mycah for the first time in this way was rather breathtaking.  Rumors abound of odd catlike creatures suddenly pouring into markets and towns and dungeons all around Norrath.  And the moon Luclin is now everpresent in the night sky.  That's a first.  Things are amiss.<br><br>Leafbringer has been playing on the tightrope that is 51 and 52, swaying back and forth between them tediously.  He still has not accepted membership in any guild, and as such considers it a fairly lucky day when he finds a good group to hang out with.  There's still something about Rangers... people don't love them yet, although at these higher levels, they should.  Leaf is now outdamaging most melee classes in battle now (solidly), and still able to jolt the mobs off of him when the aggro gets heavy.  But people don't know this unless they accept him into a group, which they don't.  Very often.  Leaf spends about eighty-percent of his time with *LFG on, hanging in dank places like Karnor's Castle, Chardok and Sebelis.  On the days he is fortunate enough to land a group, it's usually quite a successful outing.  A few weeks ago, Leaf's *LFG was answered from afar, by a rag tag collection of guilds interesting in once again conquering the Plane of Fear.  Leaf jumped at the opportunity, showed up, and had a blast for the next ten hours or so (although admittedly, he spent most of that time waiting for a resurrection in Firiona Vie).  There was a very long stretch (after a horrendous break) of nothing but success and domination, which suddenly and abruptly turned sour when the ENTIRE zone re-popped (thanks to Cazic repopping - apparently this re-pops the entire Plane).  This spelt disaster for the entire band of 30 plus people who were suddenly surrounded on all sides by completely unmanageable denizens.  In the end, Leaf's rewards for this outing were significant.  He now wears his first plate mail armor (Thorny Vine Chest Plate) and has another option on slashing weapon (Flux Bladed Axe, 7/22, procs a 150 point direct damage spell - but not very often with a lackluster Dex of 120 - still, a nice find).  The new graphics really make Leaf shine now, and his Tolan's Darkwood Helm looks UNREAL.  In fact, it's his most prized possession suddenly, as it has a really cool antler effect going on.  At this writing, Leafbringer is 52, four yellow bubs to 53 (that seems years away), with ten-percent of his experience now going into the Alternative Experience pool.  Leaf is playing with his best online buddy, the mighty paladin Centordeus Ardeo (who he's known now online for literal years) - and the two of them are spending great deals of time at the giant fortress in the Burning Woods.  Centordeus isn't quite as fond of Leaf's dark brother, Mycah, however, and every time Leaf asks &quot;Hey, do you think Mycah would get some use out of this?&quot;, Centordeus threatens to stop healing.<br><br>Speaking of Mycah.  Mycah is now mere bubs away from level 40.  The running joke is that soon enough Mycah will be powerleveling Leafbringer.  His power does indeed grow exponentially.  It's the Crystal Caverns, under the Ry'Gorr fortress in the Eastern Wastes, which are home to Mycah now.  Though he's not at all fond of the cold, the ease with which Mycah lays waste to orcs and stalagterrors and spiders is frightening.  The Leafdefiler has acquired every caster robe in the zone at least twice, and averages a daily takehome pay of around 200pp.  He's actually made a friend (Bottled Watr, the evil cleric who spends more of his time refining the art of making wounds worse rather than healing them), and the two are an unstoppable force in the caverns.  However, Mycah has outgrown the dank place and is now simply waiting for Bottled to become of sufficient power to venture out and beyond.  To where, who knows.  Bottled, a full 8 levels younger than Mycah, still has some work to do.  Mycah now casts a very sturdy pet, is able to speed things up a lot with Celerity, and has three headbuffs that everyone is envious of.  His bombs are much bigger, and as a result, so is his pocketbook.  What's grown smaller is Mycah's dependence upon his buffoon of a brother for aid.  Soon, Leafbringer will be completely unnecessary.  It's a day Mycah MOST welcomes.  It's a day his brother won't forget.<br><br>Enter the wildcard.<br><br>In the old days, when Mycah and Nathanial were just two young boys playing in the branches of the Lesser Faydark (long before the takeover by powerful and evil brownies, long before the death of the Elderleafs, long before anyone was aware Mycah was anything but a wood elf), the family acquired a pet.<br><br>It seemed a wonderful pet, a chubby and lazy cat the boys affectionately called Panthyrsong (due to the odd colorings and size of the creature, and the bizarre habit it had of half-humming, half-purring itself and the boys to sleep).  The cat wasn't looked at happily by the other denizens of the Lesser Fay, however, as it was obvious to any adult with a keen eye that this was no ordinary cat.  That at times, the beast seemed to be watching the boys.  Not just watching them, but WATCHING them.  Intently.  And intelligently.  As the boys grew, so did the cat, and at one point a Mr. Solomon McGirdle (one of the nearby treeclan elves) witnessed the &quot;cat&quot; running alongside a stream on two feet!<br><br>Well, as we all know, time passed and with it, the ravages of the Leaf clan.  The Lesser Fay was suddenly and abruptly overrun by brownies, elves were torn from their treetop villages and hurled to their deaths, a great burning occurred, and the placid elf community was completely destroyed.  Any survivors made their way to what is now Kelethin, still others were scattered to the winds.  <br><br>Neither Nathanial nor Mycah remember much of this time, other than chaos, but they do recall it as the last time either saw their mother or father.  And as Nathanial resettled in Kelethin and Mycah (who by now was well aware that his deep blue skin was not just an &quot;oddity&quot;) met others of his kind and settled in Neriak, there was a third surviving member of this family whose story is just now beginning to unfold.<br><br>It's the story of the Leafcat.  And it's one you'll be hearing more about in the days to come.<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Dec 12 11:29:22 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It's been an interesting past couple of weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the lands of Norrath became dark and haunted, and mysterious creatures sprung from unknown depths to terrorize the countrysides.  Horrible moans and howls were heard in the Western Commons, there were reports of people falling by the dozens to some horrible fate in Rathe Mountains... also stories were being told of terrifying ghouls roaming the deserts of Northern Ro.  And messages were suddenly being sent that the wide expanse of the Eastern Karanas was now home to all manner of dreadful beast.  <br><br>Both Mycah and Leaf knew where they must be.  Leaf to defend those smaller than he, Mycah to study the undead and maybe bond with them.<br><br>Having hunted all of those cursed lands, Leaf fell several times (mostly to a gargantuan skeletal wyrm called the Blood Reaver in Rathe Mountains), and Mycah fell not just once to wraiths and ghouls in the Karanas.  But in the end, after four solid days of exploring, killing, falling, and much, much looting, the results were excellent.<br><br>Leafbringer is still going through his heavy and loaded bags, Mycah has already meticulously catalogued his findings:<br><br>Sapphire Encrusted Silver Ring  ac3 int3 mana30<br><br>Charm of the Seeker (wrist)  ac3 str1 dex3 cha5 mana15<br><br>Gown of Wavering Minds  ac9 dex4 int7 mana20<br><br>Tome of Unseen Darkness (primary or secondary) int5 cha -10 magres5 disres5 mana10<br><br>Cloak of the Mind  ac4 dex3 int3 mana15<br><br>and also looted a Polished Bone Bracelet and two Black Iron Medallions<br><br>================================================<br><br>Leafbringer conducted his first dragon raid yesterday, and it paid off for him.  Lord Nagafen dropped after a fairly short fight (Leafbringer also dropped during this time - anyone not accustomed to a dragon fight, it goes something like this:<br><br>Lord Nagafen begins to cast a spell...<br>The air ignites!<br>YOU have taken 500 points of damage!<br>YOu have taken 500 points of damage!<br>YOU have taken 500 points of damage!<br>You resist the NagafenKickYerAss spell!<br>YOU have taken 500 points of damage!<br>You resist the NagafenKickYerAss spell!<br>YOU have taken 500 points of damage!<br>You hit Nagafen for 89 points of damage!<br>YOU have taken 500 points of damage!<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>Or something like that.<br><br>However, the good news for Leaf came prior to invading the dragon's lair.  In the preceding battles with fire giants, one dropped a hmm... I hope I get this right.  Polished Mithril Torque.  And the stats are pretty delicious for a neck slot.  Minor ac (can't remember precisely - 4?  7?) but 13 wisdom and 13 intelligence.  I hope I got these stats right.  It's very close if not exact.  In any case, uber for me, on it went.<br><br>We ported over to the northern cold lands of Antonica to give Lord Nagafen's twisted sister, Lady Vox, a shot - but alas we couldn't garner enough support (the Nag raid was pretty rag-tag as it was - lucky rag-taggers tho, the usual two Cloaks of Flame dropped and some other nice items).  That's where Leaf sits now, a door away from Lady vox, ready to get a port out or attempt her with 20 to 30 some others.<br><br>In any case the last several weeks have been busy.  They've resulted in lost experience for both characters, but gained goodies, and since time is not of the essence in EverQuest, it's been worth it.<br><br> <br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Leafbringer<br>-=-=-=-=-=-<br>Certainly one benefit of having a high level character (52) and a low level character (29) is that the high level character can pass on some of the extra loot, money, and certainly share information on where to go and what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leafbringer spent a cold and rainy day in the Lake of Ill Omen (it had been MANY moons since Leaf saw this part of the world), dropping off about a hundred platinum pieces to his dark brother Mycah.  Leaf's just ... like that.  Despite their differences, he only wants to help his brother succeed in life.  The real trick here of course was to drop the cash in a safe place, and get Mycah there before anyone else could find it.  Luckily there are plenty of large boulders to hide behind, and as the weather was dismal, Leaf had no trouble hiding the money.  <br><br>At present, this defines Leaf's role in life.  His younger brother has been quite active however.<br><br>Mycah<br>-=-=-<br>Mycah could care less about the comings and goings of Leafbringer, but when a note arrived at Mycah's new abode, right on the Lake of Ill Omen, saying that there would be a stash of cash waiting for him in a certain spot, Mycah *ALMOST* felt warmth toward his older brother.  With his newfound wealth, Mycah immediately became a high elf, traveled to the disgusting "We Are Family" city of Firiona, and plopped down his loot for a number of bloodstones (for use in runing his fellow melee classes), some silver and electrum (for enchanting and crafting jewelry), a few baubles (nothing fancy, certainly at least one Star Ruby &lt;sooo expensive, but the only Int jewelry producer&gt;), and a couple of rusty, but interesting looking weapons, with which to equip his animation.  Nothing like watching the old floating Sword and Shield suddenly become a floating Shan Tok / Whip combination.  Also, it looks good in combat, as hits by the pet for 11-20 were suddenly 20-40. <br><br>Mycah has been quite busy in his new home.  Surrounded constantly by all manner of goblin, sarnak, sabertooth, and skeleton, Mycah has been starting each of his late-night, six-hour sessions in a group, racking up experience points (tonight he shall most certainly ding 30), followed by a very long period of going it alone (which he prefers in order to fine-tune his abilities).  At times Mycah is using his pet.  At other times, Mycah is charming one of the nasties (usually a sturdy goblin) into being a pet.  While the former is certainly the less dangerous, it's the latter that provides the most damaging pet.  If when the charm breaks, area-effect mesmerize does not work, Mycah finds himself back at his bind spot.  Every time.  Charm is not an exact science.  And it is only used by those not worried about losing 3 or 4 blue bubbles in a botched attempt.  Still, training is training.  <br><br>Mycah is now eyeing various other locales for his new home.  He's been at the Lake a very long time now.  The stench of lake muck, goblin dung and sarnak roadkill are beginning to take their toll on this dark elf.  Obvious possibilities include the Frontier Mountains (which is a pain for an enchanter, as mesmerize spells simply *do* *not* work on giants), the Overthere (probably the best idea), or moving literally somewhere else in the world, like High Hold or Cazic or ....  /shrug.<br><br>I shall return to these tomes when there is something new to report.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There's been a cold fall wind blowing just recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's heralded some monumental changes in the life of Nathanial Leafbringer.  The most significant of these changes include the departure of Nathanial from the guild he helped begin, and was a part of for a year, Nine Realms.  As Leaf has aged, he's found that the need for grouping has increased tenfold.  In fact, it would seem that for any worthy adventure into the dark dungeons of Chardok, Sebelis or Karnor's Castle, a Cleric or an Enchanter has been an absolute must.  The Nine Realms family has provided fun, companionship, and some amazing friendships... but it has not provided either of these classes.  In fact, Nine Realms has been such a small guild that at any given time during the day, a /w all Nine has resulted in about four names max.  After an attempt at deliberation with the Counsel (Leaf having been an originating Officer of 9R himself), it was decided amicably that Leaf would move on, and take with him his enchanter alt, Mycah.  <br><br>So the world has become a little colder.  A little less hospitable.  A bit quieter.  And a little more lonely.  <br><br>But Leaf's EverQuest now is to find a new home, a warm and vibrant bunch hopefully that might accept him into their flock and provide him with the ability to effectively group and explore.  Leaf's not positive at how to go about this just yet, but go about it he will.  The future looks bright.<br><br>Last night found Leafbringer hibernating in Karnor's Castle, while his dark and evil brother crossed the threshhold of 26 and stepped squarely into the new realm of 27.  There's an almost frantic anticipation now, as only two short levels away brings about the advent of a little spell called:  Clarity.  Meanwhile, to pass the time and keep Mycah's poor mind preoccupied, he and a friend (a lizard by the name of Taylz), have been searching the muck of the Swamp of No Hope for Froglok Ton Warriors.  A component they drop (Ton Warrior Totem) is used in the creation of yet another illusion spell : Iksar, which will make traveling the world with Taylz that much easier.<br><br> 10/17/01<br>-=UPDATE-=<br>-=-=-=-=-=<br>After felling fourteen (that's 14) Froglok Ton Warriors, with MUCH THANKS to Taylz, the lizard monk with endless patience (and positive chi), a Ton Warrior Totem was FOUND!  Which led one final component to be had - shaman powder.  From the Shaman Frogs of Firiona.  (shiver)  Nasty lot.  Mycah was without the aid of Taylz when he attempted one on his own.  The result?  Calamity.  Catastrophe.  Fear of Firiona.  There are drachnids roaming everywhere, and the frogs here bash harder than anything Mycah's come across yet.  Enter:  Leafbringer.  Leaf received the message from Mycah only days later.  It was cryptic but read simply, "Need...Shaman...Powder... TO LIVE".  Leaf researched this "Shaman Powder" in tomes in Firiona and found that the frogs who drop it were in that very region.  Leaf went out exploring.  Wasn't long before he heard the telltale croaking of a frog, and with that Leaf sniffed the air, closed in on his prey, and sprung.  It was a Shaman!  Thirty seconds later Leaf was bleeding from several wounds, felt absolutely drained, and weakened.  But on the fallen (and much worse-looking) corpse of the shaman was... shaman powder.  With that, Leaf took absence, and Mycah popped onto the scene.  The final component acquired (by questionable means, sure, but there's got to be SOME reward for carrying a Ranger &lt;a RANGER, okay?&gt; through fifty-two levels (thirty some of which were before Rangers even became a viable class)... and that reward is twinking a younger character.  Debate it if you will, it works for me.  Mycah has no scruples anyway.  And now Mycah has no problem traveling the city of Cabilis, as he can now cast Illusion:Iksar.  Hurrah!<br><br>With the advent of this spell (which allows Mycah to regenerate WITHOUT the unpleasant accompanying odor of becoming a troll), Mycah leveled himself up in the Lake of Ill Omen, reached the fabled 29 (!!!), and immediately ported all about the globe, in various illusionary guises, collecting his new spells.  Among his acquisitions:<br><br>1)  Clarity.  Delightful.  Mycah is now very rarely, if ever, out of mana, when solo.  He's still always out of mana when grouped.<br><br>2)  Illusion:Water Elemental.  Now Mycah can traverse the underwater depths without a need to breathe.  Mycah hasn't found a legitimate reason for doing this yet.<br><br>3)  Illusion:Air Elemental.  This one's nice.  Mycah can now float above-ground wherever he wants (well, with the notable exception of cities where elementals are despised).  Still, it keeps his feet from smooshing into soft and horrible monster (and some PC) feces.<br><br>4)  Obscure.  A new shielding technique, which buffs armor class on himself and others.  Never off.<br><br>5)  Augmentation.  Ahhhh.  Helps in group situations where the melee classes are practically foaming at the mouth for a good haste.  This one costs less, the haste is a LITTLE slower (boo hoo), but adds AC and Agility (which equates to AC), as well as keeps Stamina from draining.  This is a nifty spell because it keeps the melees happy, and keeps Mycah in the "blue".<br><br>6)  Suffocation.  Ah yes.  The DOT.  Damage over time.  And with the damage comes some nice stat reducers.  Drops AC and Agility.  Delightful.  The progress of the damage is spread out more, however, meaning that while more damage is being done overall, it's happening at a slower rate.  Still, while soloing, it's choice.<br><br>There were other acquired spells, but this mind is tired and shall let it go at that.  Those are the most memorable anyway.  Suffice it to say Mycah is indeed a happy camper, with sights set squarely on 34 (and improved haste spells, improved self-shielding, improved runes, a fire elemental illusion which grants a damage shield, and so forth and so on)....<br><br>Happy Trailz.<br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here's a story I posted to the Spirit Tome message board anonymously.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll put it here as well.<br><br>One day I was enjoying a break from planar travel, basking in the sun and smelling the sweet smells of the woods... and Norrath, once again... and decided I should do something nice for my younger, though misguided brother. I knew he was very fond of reading, and though poor he spent whatever meager coin he could scrap up on reading materials. I rounded a corner and came upon a stream, with the stark realization that I had *no* idea what kinds of things Mycah liked to read, suddenly I heard a traveling merchant shout out that he'd like to sell a tome. A tome! No doubt this was the work of Tunare. I closed my eyes and concentrated on the face of the wolf, feeling nature's energy running throughout my being. When next I ran, the woodland creatures I passed noticed only a blur. <br><br>I could smell the salesman. It was the light but musky odor of a sweet cigar. I broke through the brush and found before me a lizard man. Instinctually my hand went to Wurmslayer, then drew back as the lizard smiled and bowed. <br><br>"What... manner of tome are you trying to sell... sir?" I asked, amazed I was actually talking to one so usually foreign to this forest. <br><br>He struggled to speak common. "Iss the tome of the sspirit.... the sssspirit tome. Come from down among the dead men. I pry it from hand of ssssoft flesh dead. It lit way out from that cursssed place. Verrry ssstrong wordssss... I ssssell to you now for nine hundred and fifty platinum. You give coin to me." <br><br>Nine Hundred and Fifty Platinum!! Tunare!! <br><br>I had it. I'd saved up a lot from my adventures in the Burning Woods. Wurmslayer was a might sword, but the pieces were not hard to acquire, and I'd become quite adept and finding the pieces for it. As such, I'd amassed a small fortune for myself just recently. While I'd been planning on buying grand weaponry (I had my eye on a dagger that I'd seen literally change a man into a wolf, and I do not lie), this whole transaction felt somehow ... meant, and I knew it could only be the work of Tunare. And I dare not deny her all powerful, all loving will. I looked left, then right. We seemed alone. I smelled the air. Sweet cigars, a rabbit nearby, nothing more. <br><br>I reached into my backpack and pulled from it a large satchel. Inside was my accumulated wealth, better protected by me than by any banker. I handed him the platinum in handfulls. He took it gingerly, tongue darting in and out, and from his own bags he pulled a dusty book. It was the color of a crypt wall and its binding was ripped in several places, yet when it was removed from the bag, shadows danced around us as a pale, sickly light emanated from it. I moved to open the book and the lizard's hand darted out and clasped my own. I felt as though I'd been grabbed by the trunk of a tree, his hands were hard and had no warmth. <br><br>"The wordsss are not for you." <br><br>And with that, he released me, turned away, and walked into the foliage. Almost instantly I could not sense him. He was no longer anywhere nearby. A chill ran down my spine, but a smile broke across my face. <br><br>------------------- <br><br>Two days later I arrived, weary from travel, at the edge of Nektolos Forest. To continue inside would be unwise, as the guards that roamed the area protected my brother fiercely. Should I happen upon one of these guards, blood bond notwithstanding, the guards would try to take me into custody. I'm a wood elf. Mycah... Mycah on the other hand had very mysterious beginnings. My mother adopted him six years after I was born, and his pale complexion didn't seem quite so out of the ordinary at that time. He was a baby after all, and one prone to sickness at that. However, as he grew older it became evident that Mycah was not like us. His pale skin began turning a dark hue of blue. I remember those dark days of school. Mycah would wear layers of clothing in order to hide his flesh, and apply ointments to make his face appear fair. In time I'm sure it was this insecurity that drove him to become an illusionist. To meet Mycah, one never knows if one is meeting the true physical Mycah. Only I really know what he looks like naturally. But I digress... <br><br>Today I found Mycah quite quickly, near the edge of the forest. His odor is unmistakable. It's the smell of coal and something dead. Today Mycah is in the guise of the undead. Very unnerving, but allows him fairly safe passage through these haunted and horrible forests, or so he says. I somewhat suspect he enjoys that form. I somewhat suspect Mycah is losing his mind. <br><br>"Hail brother." I say. <br><br>A high cackle emits from what once was my brother, now a pile of bones connected loosely by small flaps of bloody flesh and muscle. One eyeball dangles loosely from a hollow socket. With the speed of the trapdoor spider, my Guardian Sword snaps out and clips it away from his face. There's a little blood, but not much. Mycah doesn't flinch. I feel better about things. <br><br>"Hail brother." says Mycah, "You are no doubt here to try to pull me out of these dark woods and I'll not have it... for one thing..." <br><br>"Nay." I interrupted, "I am here to deliver to you a gift. I thought perhaps it would help you see in there, and give you something to do as well." <br><br>With that, I handed him the Spirit Tome. <br><br>He grasped it with his fingerbones. He studied the binding, tracing the cracks with a particularly skinny digit. Then he opened the book. <br><br>Immediately the skeletal illusion was replaced with Mycah, as I knew him to be. His face was contorted into a pure mixture of absolute understanding and absolute fright. As his eyes swept the pages, he looked the way most three year olds look, wide-eyed and gaping mouth, finally grasping something profound in the mind, yet... not quite equipped to handle the results of that knowledge. Shadows danced around us. The light from nowhere flickered in Mycah's eyes. <br><br>His eyes raised and met my own. They tightened into squints and a very dark smile ripped across his face. <br><br>"Oh brother...." <br><br>he said, and his voice very nearly mesmerized me where I stood. Now it was I who was trembling. Trembling before my own brother. <br><br>"You know not what you've done." <br><br>And with that a horrible and horrendous laugh thundered through my head. I fell to one knee and began concentrating. I looked for the spirit of the wolf amidst the raging laughter and found it cowering. With all the will I could muster I begged the spirit to take me. And so it did. At once I was transformed and immediately I retreated from this dark place. I ran so fast I believe there may still be a trail there. <br><br>I also realized that I had been mistaken. For the deed which I had done could not have been planned by Tunare. And now what I'd leashed upon the world would be my fault. Woe was me. <br><br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>10/2/2001<br><br>Leafbringer is still in Kunark, and has been there for some time now.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's just not built for the cold of Velious (although from time to time he must make the journey there).  Currently Leaf is rigorously searching for any additional information on a possible quest for a wonderful longbow.  Rumors say an involved component might be a Yellow Whip (which Leaf found on the corpse of a Wulfware Lonewolf he just slaughtered), and the Firiona Vie Warrior Captain, Nealith.  True enough Nealith has a brother who has disappeared.  It's obvious the Captain is upset about it.  Leaf wants only to aid the Captain in seeing his brother returned safely or put to rest (although Leaf suspects he may have put him to rest already... <br><br>In any case, tonight's exploits will likely revolve around Old Sebelis.  Last night Leaf and his party almost made it to the room nicknamed "Disco".  Just prior to arrival however, an enchanter's mesmerization spell broke and the tunnel the group was in became a fever of attacking frogloks, golems and bugs.  All perished and considering the time (around 6 a.m. in the morning), that was the end of that adventure.  It's likely Leaf will return again tonight, as the promise of dropped Sebelite Scaled Leggings and the like are too much to pass on.<br><br>It's been a long road to 52.  The person who controlls Leaf is not tempted to play Dark Age of Camelot.  In fact, the only game this player is drooling over currently is a little thing called Shadows of Luclin.  Following that, who knows, but there's a game called Horizons on the... uh... horizon, that looks to be quite promising.  <br><br>In any case, it's another night in Kunark.  So ends this journal entry.<br>&nbsp;<br>Leafbringer, Pathfinder<br>Leafdefiler, Undead Enchanter<br>Leafcat, Once a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once.</td></tr>
