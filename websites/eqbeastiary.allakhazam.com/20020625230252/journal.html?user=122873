	   <tr><td colspan=2>I thought it might be a good idea to solicit some more Drunken Bandit company in our jaunt back down to the bottom of Runnyeye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Verdente told the other bandits that the Biggles girls were fun to be with, so they responded with surprising enthusiasm!  An Iksar monk named Eats (who had welcomed me when I joined the guild) met us immediately... a few more said they were on their way to Runnyeye.<br><br>In all the hustle and bustle of a preliminary visit to the bottom floor, which included Eats' unfortunate death in the Evil Eye prisoner room, we lost count of the number of people who offered to join our group.  People would offer to tell their friends (ooc: log on their alts) to join us, and being new, I didn't know who was whom.  Eventually we gathered at the top of Runnyeye and formed a party of six.  Besides Eats, there were Manianie, Forsheezy, and Doktah - the cleric who was kind enough to invite us to the guild after we met him in Paludal Caverns!  It was nice to see him again.<br><br>Suddenly a rogue appeared, who didn't have any of the usual Drunken Bandit trappings.  &quot;I'm ready, invite me!&quot;  I wasn't sure who he was.  Phanny recognized him since she met him a few days before.  The other bandits weren't familiar with him, and decided to disregard his requests.<br><br>Finally we learned that (ooc: how do I say this in character!  his alt is a guild member); he was technically one of the first people to accept our invitation.<br><br>Phanny suggested we split into two smaller groups, especially since we had two clerics at hand.  Someone else said that plan might result in some deaths....  I was at a loss for words, and apparently the others were too.  Finally, Phanny couldn't stand leaving Jazrat by his lonesome, and decided to leave our party to join him.  I squealed with disappointment, but Phanny stood her ground.  She ran off to find Jazrat again, but he was gone.  By then all the wind was out of her sails; she decided to run back to Rivervale and visit the family.  Jazrat soon returned and took Phanny's place in the group.<br><br>As soon as Phanny disbanded, the other Bandits were suddenly quite vocal about the situation.  Nearly all of them offered to leave so that she could join the group again.  They knew that we were close family, and nobody wanted to split up the Biggles.  I begged Phanny to return, to no avail.<br><br>Her departure cast a pallor over the rest of the adventure, at least in my eyes.  We Bandits weren't used to each others' styles, and didn't plan very well.  Luckily, I believe nobody died.  On the plus side, I met several fellow Bandits, picked up several pieces of blackened iron and alloy armor, and learned some warrior strategy from my comrades.  <br><br>Eats told me that my beloved claws were no longer acceptable for a warrior of my class.  As sad as I would feel to give up my claws, which once did me such service, I know he is correct.  I started to pay attention to the damage my comrades were doing to Zelniaks in Marus Seru (seems we always end up there) and was horrified at my comparatively paltry output.  If I keep my ratty claws, I won't be taken seriously as a warrior.  I have enough trouble with that, being short and female.  Eats told me about some fast swords which can be found in Guk.  I'm going to ask Phanny to accompany me there.  It's been quite a while since we had an actual mission!<br><br>Lessons learned:  Two small groups do not equal an extra large group.  Find better weapons.  I don't want to run around without Phanny ever again.  Pay more attention!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jun 17 16:52:06 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yeeee!!!<br><br>I found Phanny next to Dawnshroud Peaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;while I was passed out she hunted there for a while with some nice people.  We grouped with two older people and tried to fight near the entrance.  The blasted wolves kept running up behind Phanny and chewing her to bits!  After she died twice mere moments apart, we gave up on Dawnshroud.<br><br>At a loss for what to do next, we asked a few guildies if they would like some company.  Verdente, an Iksar shadowknight, accepted our invitation.  We decided to meet in Rivervale for soulbinding purposes, then venture to Runnyeye for a goblin feast!<br><br>Unfortunately the Rivervale guards kill Iksar on sight - a problem we forgot about until he reached the edge of town.  While he shouted for some invisibility, I surprisingly both remembered that I could buy him invisibility potions from a druid merchant, AND remembered where his shop was!  I bought him two vials with all the money I had, but by then he found a nice bard to help him cross Rivervale.  I gave him the potions anyway, just in case.<br><br>We forgot about all the guards in Misty Thicket too.  The bard offered to run him across the thicket with his Invisibility song.  Phanny ran off on her own shortcut while Verdente and I followed the bard.  <br><br>Near Blixxen Entopop's house, Verdente got just far enough away that he appeared AND lost sight of the invisible bard.  Just then Blixxen saw him and started to attack!  I shrieked and ran for them both.  This was my new friend and guild comrade Blixxen was attacking!  Forced to choose between Blixxen and Verdente, I knocked Blixxen upside the head to get his attention.  He turned to me, so Verdente was able to run.  By then the bard returned and invis'd Verdente again.<br><br>I didn't really want to KILL the little bug-collecting bugger, so I fled after Verdente got away.  Making a bee-line for the wall guards, I briefly wondered how they'd react to me now.  They bowed their heads in respect until they saw a bloody, enraged Blixxen Entopop on my tail.  They screamed and joined the chase!  I yelped and ran straight for the entrance to Runnyeye.  <br><br>During this time, Phanny was terrified, asking where the heck we were.  Verdente and the bard were lost, and asked where the heck Runnyeye was.  As I approached the tunnel, I called out its coordinates and turned around to see if I was still being followed.  Sure enough, charging me were three guards and Blixxen Entopop.  Thinking that if Verdente was close behind me, they would kill him after they killed me, so I tried to lure them away from the door.  They killed me after just a few steps; in that moment I was able to call out the coordinates a few more times before I lost consciousness.  Luckily also, they killed me so fast, they left the tunnel before the others reached it.  Everyone else survived!<br><br>The bard wished us luck and went on his merry way.  We three Drunken Bandits toasted each other on a chaotic run gone reasonably well - of the three of us, I was glad to be the only one who died!  It didn't bother me at all, it was  actually pretty amusing!  The guards have already forgiven me, so no harm done.<br><br>We ran around Runnyeye for quite a while - I forgot my way around so we got a bit lost.  No trouble though.  At one point Verdente disappeared but said Follow me!  We reached the very deep well.  I peered down and saw Verdente near the bottom of it on a ledge.  I hesitated only a moment before I clamped my nose and jumped!  It was so much fun!  Phanny yelled &quot;Geronimo!&quot; when she leapt into the well.<br><br>We ventured into the Evil Eye prisoner area and found secret rooms!  Later Verdente found a new stairway down, and we ended up in what I think is the bottom floor of Runnyeye.  Wandering around were the toughest goblins in the place, but weren't too tough for us.  Phanny and I hid behind an old boat while Verdente brought goblins back to us.  We slaughtered them by the dozens!<br><br>Kadene, another guild member, decided to meet Verdente to give him a spell parchment.  While trying to find her, we were horribly ambushed by scores of goblins!  They just wouldn't stop coming!  Finally they retreated, which was a good thing because Phanny was out of mana and we were all quite damaged.  We lived though, none of us died in Runnyeye!<br><br>On our way back to the top so we could camp, we made a wrong turn and inadvertently found the actual Evil Eye prisoners.  I swear they were the biggest Evil Eyes I had ever seen!  I'm glad they didn't see us.  Maybe we'll sneak back down there and &quot;liberate&quot; them, hee hee!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Jun 15 14:43:15 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc<br><br>This little ditty doesnt' have anything to do with Bristlebane - but it was so amazing, I thought it was worth sharing with someone who would understand.<br><br>Jenga and Thufur, RL husband, gnome wizard and co-conspirator, were tucked away in the Paludal Caverns tackling Patog Phlarg fiends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two phlarg fiends at a time would suck up all our mana, but we always managed to kill them without dying ourselves.  We were trying to get Thufur up to level 21 before bedtime. You all know how that is....  <br><br>Thufur said, &quot;just one more fiend ought to do it!&quot;  So we crept over to a pair, and I cast Malise on one to get its attention.  I was surprised that the second fiend didn't seem to notice, and said as much to Thufur.  Of course, saying something out loud jinxed it, and suddenly I had THREE fiends on me.  Too much, too much.  The monsters resisted all our roots, and stuns didn't help reduce the horrible damage I was taking.  We had the first of the three almost dead - I said &quot;we'll just kill this one and evacuate, OK?&quot;  Thufur didn't hear me though; he said later he made the executive decision to evacuate without considering his experience.  My health dipped to half a bubble as I heard Thufur's evac spell engage.  Then, practically simultaneously, I killed the first phlarg fiend, Thufur dings, and we evac out!  I had 50 hit points left, and was inflicted with the spreading crud.<br><br>Only once have I seen such a close call, and it didn't involve a DING.  That was a crazy moment!  And a lot of fun!<br><br>If anyone else has a similar close call, please tack it on to this message.  I'd like to hear about them!<br><br>/ooc<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Why switch guilds?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why be in a guild to begin with?  Granted, I haven't had much experience with one, but my reasoning is as follows:<br><br>The Sands of Time was full of very nice and mature people.  The guild is very laid back - no meetings, requirements, etc.  The Drunken Bandits, while deceptively irreverent, have requirements, and a fairly tough initiation (at least, you have to have multiple sponsors).<br><br>Phanny and I discussed the guild choice at length.... Ultimately, we both agreed that the Drunken Bandits offer us an outlet for being bawdy that Real Life doesn't offer, and the Sands of Time doesn't necessarily encourage.  <br><br>I can't drink alcohol in real life.... all the more enjoyable then, is getting Phreda good and ripped.  Phanny is usally always tipsy anyway!<br><br>Certain kinds of guilds can do an awful lot to influence a person to get more into their character.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ugh, well, Phanny died again - once again we formed a party with Eceya and two new chaps, Mindbuf and Terrog.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Terrog had an awesome see-thru, day-bright shield!)  We crept around the Netherbian Lair and were overcome by Troglodytes.  One by one our comrades disappeared, until only Phanny remained by my side.  We found a quiet little spot to drag unsuspecting Trogs.  It seemed too boring though, so we shouted out for another person.  And from there our luck turned for the better!<br><br>Our new friend is Beoldorf, a very tall Barbarian Warrior.  He immediately suggested we follow him out to Marus Seru, next door to the Netherbian Lair.  Easygoing as we usually are, Phanny and I agreed.  Beoldorf led us out into a snow-white desert with an intoxicating, cloudy, breezy blue sky.  Phanny remarked that she felt like she was at the bottom of the ocean.<br><br>We only ventured over a few hills past the entrance to the Lair, to a quiet spot where we set up camp.  Beoldorf brought monsters back to us to slay, since he was more familiar with the lay of the land.  There were rhino beetles, rockhoppers, giant centipede looking things and Zelniaks.  The Zelniaks were very tall, leathery creatures that looked like they should be domesticated and ridden!  In the wild though, those suckers are bloodthirsty and aggressive.  Oh yeah - we also killed a few Recusos, desert bandits who were not madmen, yet seemed to need a bit of therapy.  After I tapped one on the shoulder with my Icetooth claw, he turned around and said, &quot;I have nothing left to lose, but can you say the same?!&quot;  Well, since you have nothing left to lose....  heh heh heh.<br><br>Beoldorf was a pleasant fellow who knew his stuff.  He was as careful as I was to protect Phanny; kept us busy, but never let us get in over our heads.  At several points the battles were tough and our adrenaline was pumping - but we never had to run for our lives.  <br><br>I finally got in touch with Renlaria, and told her we wanted to leave the Sands of Time.  It was hard to explain that we just didn't really feel like we fit in.  We removed ourselves from the guild on amicable terms; I vowed to always be her friend, and that she could rely on me whenever she needed help.  <br><br>At the end of our very long, successful day, Phanny and I said goodbye to Beoldorf and ran back to the Marus Seru guards.  She fell asleep right away, but I was still wired.  I wanted to see if the Drunken Bandits were still around, and if they'd still have me.  Sure enough, one of them offered to meet me in North Karana and invite me to their guild.  I zipped down to Antonica on the spires, ran to Freeport to receive a new tunic from them, and passed out in the Freeport bank.  <br><br>I hope Phanny doesn't mind that I'm so far away, I'll run as fast as I can back to Marus Seru.  We like Luclin pretty well; if we don't stay in Marus Seru, we'll just look around a bit!<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Phanny and I camped in Misty Thicket, as it was much more comfortable than the third floor of Runnyeye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Misty Thicket is so much different than it used to be!  Many more bugs, (I bet Blixxen Entopop is happy about that!) and zombies too.  Running through here makes me sentimental about my youth.  I used to follow Bukko and Phanny around, careful to stay on the path, and fear that I might get lost and die in the wilderness.  I would cautiously bap bixies upside the head, while looking out of the corner of my eye for my sister or father.  My, how things have changed!<br><br>One of Phanny's cleric friends told her recently about a special Netherbian Chitin that had special magic for clerics and other casters.  She said it could only be found on the Trog King deep in the Netherbian Lair.  One look at the evil glint in Phanny's eye as she relayed the news told me we'd be making another trip up to Luclin.  I'm up for it!  I want to see the world!<br><br>While in Shadow Haven, I bought some more fletching bits for practice, (I haven't kept up with that like I intended), bandages, bloodstones for Phanny's spell, and lots of booze.  First I bought a stack of bourbon for Phanny; then I realized I didn't have much money left, and had to buy really cheap wine for myself.  heh heh!  It doesn't taste too bad.<br><br>The main hallways of Netherbian Lair are very pretty!  The guards aren't very threatening though.  Either they are junior guards, or I'm getting tougher than I realize!  Off the main hallway are windy, dark and moldy passages chock full of fungoids, troglodytes, and Netherbians. The fungoids looked like phlarg fiends.  The Netherbians looked like phlarg fiends without any skin or eyes!  YUCK!  Nothing but exposed muscle.  Gross!  The Troglodytes were fairly interesting.  They looked like a cross between humans and orcs.  I don't want to think about how they ended up looking like that.<br><br>We met two nice people right away, and formed a party.  Llandru was a half elf bard, and Eceya was a high elf wizard.  Things went pretty smoothly, most of the time.  The Netherbians had a way of sensing my presence and following me out of the tunnels when I didn't expect it.  Once, instead of two Netherbians, four followed me out and attacked!  We bore down on them with all our might.  Soon Eceya ran out of mana, and Phanny did too.  Two Netherbians were still alive, and hitting me hard!  I was almost dead, bleeding all over the place!  Phanny stepped back and meditated as fast as she could.  I started swaying half conscious, and she managed to heal me enough to snap out of it.  The Netherbians continued to strike, but at least I was still hitting back!  Then Llandru started singing a healing song, doubly amazing since he was fighting too.  As we finished off the last Netherbian, I crumpled to the floor.  I surely would have died if Phanny hadn't cast that little spell, and Llandru hadn't sung his sweet song.  And if I had died, the Netherbians surely would have turned on the others, and killed some of them too.<br><br>Later on, we met a Vah Shir shaman named Khattasah, and decided we were strong enough to dive into the tunnels.  After finding a spot to hide, I crept around alone to find some more victims.  The halls were empty for a long distance.  Then suddenly, I spied the Trog King himself!  Quietly, I whipped out my bow and fired at him.  He and two of his toadies ran after me.  Unfortunately, those empty tunnels back to the group had repopulated with Netherbians, some of whom followed me and the troglodytes.  When I returned with my quarry to the group, we blasted them like crazy.  I dealt the killing blow to the Trog King!  That was satisfying.  But they ultimately outnumbered us.  I think Phanny died first, quickly followed by Khattasah and Llandru.  Only Eceya and I made it out alive.  She escaped by gating, I think.  I only managed to survive because the remaining troglodytes followed someone else out of a different tunnel.  We were both very close to death.  <br><br>Eceya, that clever girl, managed to loot the corpse of the Trog King before she escaped.  Unfortunately, instead of a Netherbian Chitin, all he had was a pair of soiled britches.  I suggested we let the casualties from that overpull roll on the nasty pants, but we ended up giving them to Khattasah.  I was very sad that my carelessness had caused so much death, but nobody yelled at me.  It really was an accident.<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As we promised, Phanny and I invited Doggans to join us for a day of bashings and smashings.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he managed to squeeze into a goblin hunting party in the basement in Highpass Keep, and didn't want to sacrifice his spot.  I guess I understood his motives.  Honestly, Phanny and I wouldn't have minded joining a goblin group downstairs, but that place is packed to the point of discomfort.  Too many people competing over a few smelly goblins, in a dank, confined space.<br><br>Phanny met a Barbarian beastlord chap who was also left out of the party downstairs.  We three decided to leave Highpass and creep around Kithicor Forest.  The last time I ran through it, I saw some Shralok Orcs.  Maybe they also carried backpacks like the swell one I gave Phanny?  Unfortunately, we only slew a few Kithicor Shraloks before night fell.  After chatting with our friend for a while, (I wish I could remember his name!!!!  Argh!!!  I'll ask Phanny) we snuck through Kithicor to Rivervale and then to Runnyeye.<br><br>As we approached our usual resting place on the second floor, we discovered two scantily clad ladies huddled there.  They asked us to help them retrieve their corpses.  We immediately obliged; we split up and followed each one to her corpse, which was not far away and easy to spot.  We invited them to join us; our party of three became a party of five.  They were a ranger elf named Serienya and a monk human named Miaoxi.  <br><br>It didn't take long to determine that the goblins were too wimpy for the likes of us.  I led the group through a door and down a flight of stairs to where I knew the Sporalis hung out.  Now this was more like it! We killed a few mushrooms, continued down a hallway and found a fairly large room with a small well to one side.  Three more tunnels radiated from our room, all of which were full of Sporali dead meat.  But after a few fights, our Barbarian friend lost his step and fell down the well!<br><br>&quot;Help me, aaaa!&quot;  he cried, then was silent.  Phanny gasped, and concluded he was dead.  What the heck was down there?!  Just then we heard the similarly tragic yelp from Lord Pickclaw - you know, they always say something like &quot;you haven't heard the last of me, doody head!&quot;  A moment later a trimphant looking elf walked out of one of the tunnels.  <br><br>I knew he must have been the one to kill Lord Pickclaw, so I began pleading with him to help us retrieve our friend's body from the well.  Surely he could withstand whatever horrible thing is down there.  Tekian kindly accepted, and jumped like a pro down into the well.  A moment later our friend's corpse sprung up out of the water onto the floor.  Tekian immediately followed.  Phanny cast her resurrection spell, which made our Barbarian pal appear next to his corpse, dazed but all right.<br><br>Not long after that, we discovered that half of our room had extremely slick goo on the floor.  It made fighting a Sporali difficult, (as I'd run at him, swing my claws at him, then pass him by!) but great fun between fights.  At one point one of the ladies was doing figure 8s in the slime!  All it would take is one step, and you'd glide all the way to the far end!  Eventually, I learned to slide to the side and fight with my back to the wall, and to turn my body as I slid, so I always faced the fungus.  It required subtlety, not one of my strong points.  Phanny and the ladies (the Barbarian had to leave early) usually stayed on the firmer portion of the dungeon, but since I was designated puller, I had to do a lot of running through slime.  It was a blast!<br><br>(Runnyeye?  Runnynose is more like it!  *snicker*)<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jun 11 12:29:28 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

Rainah generously supplied me with a cumbersome sack of electrum which she had personally enchanted.  She is a lovely creature, is she not?<br><br>Hour after hour I toiled within the confines of Sothure's Fine Gems.  The ratio of success to failure was never so astonishing!

Use the rest of your money to make and sell jewelry; surely someone will find your handiwork as lovely as I do!<br><br>I have a few items that Bukko wore stashed away in the bank....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Phanny and I both decided not to kill any more treants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consciences were bothering us.  Phanny liked my suggestion that we return to the mines of Highpass Keep to slaughter a few goblins, you know, for old times sake!  We had fun there before, seems like a lifetime ago.<br><br>As we scurried through the Karanas, I remembered something I forgot to put in my journal.  The last time we were here, I got my revenge on Broon!  That nasty, lumpy one-eyed monster who killed me so many seasons ago.  This time, since I was not running from him, I could see how much taller he was than me, like treant tall.  He was just as ugly as I remembered though!<br><br>Anyway, at the Highpass Keep bank, Phanny heard a shout from a fellow who was forming a goblin smashing group downstairs.  Phanny told him we'd join, and he said &quot;hurry!&quot;  The mines turned out to be packed with like-minded fighters.  Chicoeltico had managed to reserve a small side room for us.  We sat down, became acquainted, and waited.<br><br>Goblins didn't show up very often; when they did arrive they didn't last long.  I spent most of the downtime sneaking around the small, dark room for practice.  Occasionally I would peer out into the busy main room, wishing the other people would go away so we wouldn't be stuck in this closet.<br><br>Suddenly Doggans appeared.  He wanted to show us his new Wurmslayer, say hello and attempt to kiss us.  Chicoeltico bristled instantly and whispered to me, &quot;Whatever you do, don't group with him!  He's an -- &quot; well, I won't repeat that.  <br><br>Doggans finally realized who our new party member was, and immediately started hooting and hollering about how much he disliked Chicoeltico.  There was NO love between the two.  Chicoeltico told me he was Ignoring Doggans, but couldn't ignore the fact that Doggans danced in front of him, flipping him off and trying to duel him.  <br><br>Chicoeltico refused to duel, but said nasty things back to Doggans.  He was a Barbarian of modest means, who couldn't beat a Wurmslayer in a duel but wasn't ashamed of it.  Doggans was obviously given that Wurmslayer by someone more powerful, and was not ashamed of being called a &quot;twinkie&quot; (as Chicoeltico put it).  Like roosters at home, they puffed out their feathers, tried to prove their superiority, and made a lot of noise.<br><br>Phanny and I didn't put up with that for very long before we started yelling at both of them to shut up and seperate!  Doggans was a decent friend to us - a bit too flirty but all right. (We are two rather foxy chicks, after all!)  Chicoeltico was normally more mature and courteous, and worthy of remaining friends.  <br><br>We had no interest in taking sides in their petty fighting.  Phanny pulled Doggans aside, asked him to leave us alone, and invited him to join us for an adventure next week.  The rest of our day with Chicoeltico went smoothly (but too quiet!)<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>------------------------------------------------<br><br>Phreda,<br><br>Esteemed friend, do accept my apology for my absence in Erudin, and forward my sentiments to Rainah.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have not inconvenienced you.  The underlying cause of my tardiness, as superlative as it is, may soothe your vexation.  You may also be compelled to soothe your Humble Elf.<br><br>Enjoined to rendezvous with Rainah in Erudin, I bid adieu at daybreak to my comfortable lodging in West Commonlands and and ventured west through Kithicor Forest.  Despite a lack of map, I navigated successfully through labyrinthine Highpass.  This, as you may recall, was previously unknown territory to me.<br><br>I eventually reached a point where the towering walls of of Highpass split.  I noticed a cliff before me, and a path hugging the steep rocky face.  Curious, I decided to observe the depths of the cliff.  My foot slipped on the edge - my mind had but a split second to gauge the incredible depth of the cliff before I realized I would soon be acquainted with the bottom of it!<br><br>Friend, I believed that all was lost.  My descent took several seconds, each of which were perceived as a lifetime.  During that time I contemplated how small my corpse would appear when standing on the pass above, and whether it would be retrievable.  I also clawed at the rock wall in a desperate effort to retard my descent.  Indeed, if I had clawed a whit less, I might not have survived.<br><br>However, I did survive the incredible fall, but not without significant injury.  I was indescribably close to death.  My hands, feet, elbows and back were bloodied beyond recognition.  My blue Senior Apprentices' Robe is in tatters.<br><br>Luckily I was able to walk to a point where the ascent to the Karana Plains was acceptable for someone in my condition.  As soon as my eyes met the familiar prairie, my ears registered a shout - &quot;Free goodies! First come first serve at the Bridge!&quot;  I limped as quickly as possible to said Bridge, where a half dressed Barbarian greeted me.  Phreda, you would not believe the treasures he imparted to me!  Most are designed for a warrior, but a few suited me well.  I shall bequeath them to you immediately.  <br><br>After the near death experience and running like a Mad Elf across the Karana plains, I collapsed on the bridge, unable to continue.  My wounds, however, will not prevent me from reaching my destination directly.<br><br>Your Humble Elf,<br><br>L.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Mmmmm, we did something naughty!&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very bad at keeping secrets, so I'll spill my guts here.  I know Phanny reads my journal, but that's okay because she was in on it too.<br><br>We had just returned to Runnyeye.  I was about to creep downstairs to aggravate a Sporali Gumdrop when Phanny grabbed my shoulder.  &quot;Hey, want to hunt some treants?&quot;  I boggled at her.  Is this my sister talking?  <br><br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  I countered.  Phanny said, &quot;Pryest asked me if we wanted to join him.&quot;  I considered for about three seconds before I agreed.  She let him know we were coming, and off we ran towards South Karana.<br><br>&quot;So,&quot;  I poked Phanny somewhere along the way, &quot;who's Pryest?&quot;  &quot;I don't know,&quot; she answered.  I boggled again at the situation.  Not only were we on our way to hunt creatures sacred to our Druid dad, we were doing so at the bidding of a complete stranger.  &quot;If you didn't know him, how did he know to ask you, and why?&quot;  &quot;I don't know,&quot; she answered. &quot;We'll have to ask him when we get there.&quot;  It is difficult to gab and run at the same time, after all.  <br><br>I spent the silence during the jaunt over to S.K. thinking about the situation. Bukko would go nuts if he knew we were hunting treants.  But he isn't here anymore.  Treants have always been such frightening creatures.  I remember the first time I saw one cross my path when I was much younger.  I stopped cold and stared like I've never stared before.  So much taller than me, and so strange looking!  Even now, I am barely as tall as the top of its roots.<br><br>Anyway, we met Pryest, who turned out to be a Barbarian warrior.  He found out about Phanny by referencing some kind of Norrathian Clerics' directory.  He led us to a place where treants were plentiful, and we slew a few.  It was exhilarating!  Dangerous too.  They rooted us and cast really damaging spells on us.  We called out for another party member and an Iksar monk who called himself Lizardhead joined us.  Like Comoto, he was a jovial fellow, and played dead to Phanny's delight.  <br><br>With the four of us working together, the treants didn't stand a chance.  One after another fell with a great big THWUMP, its limbs cracking upon impact.  At one point I found a wooden heart, and my own turned a bit cold.   <br><br>I knew I shouldn't be killing them, they never did me wrong.  I have druid friends too - some of them even sent friendly messages to me and Phanny while we were fighting.  We didn't tell them what we were doing!  But the weird things was, after we felled a few dozen treants, the new ones were only somewhat apprehensive to me.  It was as if they didn't seem to mind!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>We did it, we finally joined a guild.&nbsp;&nbsp;Phanny and I arranged to meet Renlaria and a druid friend of hers in West Commonlands, to formally tie the knot with the Sands of Time.  Phanny was at first hesitant, because she didn't want to have to go to a lot of meetings.  This guild doesn't have any!  They just do good deeds and keep each other company.  <br><br>Renlaria offered to show me some of the guild has to offer its members.  Wow, I never saw a Wurmslayer before...  As Lemoni would say, she was bedecked with fineries.  She said I could borrow some things too, but I told her I wasn't in it for the goodies.  And I'm not.  (Yeah, let's see how long that holds out!)<br><br>Fortune also smiled upon me and Phanny, even before we joined the Sands of Time.  We ventured down into Runnyeye to survey its challenge; we found it a worthy place to spend some time.  Phanny has a quiet place to sit while I scout out for monsters.  The Sporali are funny looking candy-shaped creatures, who keep to themselves and are easy to find.  The Pickclaw goblins are plentiful; although they are tougher to beat than the Sporali, they often wear nice armor which makes up for the trouble.  I am already wearing a shiny black cape that we pulled from one of the Pickclaws with glee.<br><br>Oh yeah - I was charmed for the first time!  It was awful! One of the goblins used me against my sister.  I couldn't tell what was going on, but I could hear her cries of confusion and pain.  After I regained control of myself, I found myself next to her.  She said I attacked her!  She was scared half to death, because she knows I'm a death machine with these claws.  <br><br>I felt bad that I hurt her, but that's just the sort of problem adventurers must contend with.  Sometimes enchanting goblins take control of your brain and make you do bad things to your little sister.  <br><br>Come to think of it, I used that excuse when I was a kid, but my parents never believed me.  I swear, this time it's true!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed May  1 08:55:34 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While waiting for Doggans to arrive, a ranger named Jadl asked me if I'd like to hunt some bandits with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;I put him off until I was able to talk to Doggans (Phanny wasn't yet ready for action); we agreed to group with Jadl and a Vah Shir beastlord named Rawtooth.<br><br>We ran along the bumpy narrow path to the bandit camp at the far end of the stinky Paludal pool, then made camp behind one of the Recondite tents.  The situation deteriorated almost immediately....  Doggans was intent on picking fights with the bandits, despite the cries for regeneration on the part of our casters.  At times it seemed as if he didn't notice his own critical wounds.  I wished Phanny would arrive to relieve those fellows from the burden of healing.  They really weren't cut out for that business.<br><br>During the middle of one skirmish, I heard someone ask if &quot;camp two&quot; was taken.  Not knowing what they meant, I shouted back &quot;Which camp is &quot;camp two?&quot;  No reply.  A few moments later Phanny arrived.  She healed us tanks, and we all sat for a rest.  Suddenly six people gathered at the other end of the Recondite camp and proceeded to slaughter all remaining bandits.  We watched in astonishment.  Angry, I beckoned the others in my party to join me in the middle of the Recondite camp, in an effort to re-establish our territory.  The six strangers spread out around us and proceeded to kill every bandit as soon as it appeared.  Instead of being able to split the camp in two, they decided to take the whole camp without regard for us.  <br><br>I had a few private words with Mikull, the one of the six who had asked if &quot;Camp Two&quot; was taken.  Apparently WE were at Camp Two. I asked him why he bothered to ask if he obviously didn't care that someone was at the camp already.  I told him I shouted back asking which camp was Camp Two, so I could tell him if it was taken or not, and he said, &quot;No you didn't.&quot;  He further said that &quot;Since we made it all this way, we aren't going to leave now.&quot;  He expressed an insincere sounding apology and returned to his mates.<br><br>The five of us were out of luck.  There was apparently no room in Paludal Caverns for us.  We gathered at the entrance to Shadow Haven to contemplate our next move.  Jadl said he needed to bank, and ran off.  We all waited for him to return.  After a few moments, he shouted &quot;HELP ME!!!&quot; We looked around bewildered.  He from BEHIND us into Shadow Haven, with a train of bandits on his tail.  We picked off the bandits quickly.<br><br>He expressed disgust at the situation and said he was nearly killed.  Phanny asked him to walk back to her so she could heal him, but he didn't appear or answer.  A few minutes later we asked what he was doing.  He said &quot;I'm meditating - I had to spend all my mana healing myself.&quot;  That didn't make any sense to us - why didn't he just let Phanny heal him?  We resumed our conversation, waiting for him to return to us.<br><br>There we were, sitting and waiting for him to meet us in the main tunnel to Paludal Caverns, and joking with each other.  Suddenly we hear him again - &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE!!!  WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING ME??!!&quot;  Once again, we look around bewildered.  Once again he comes from BEHIND us with a half a dozen bandits chasing him.  <br><br>How did all four of us manage not to see him pass us by TWICE in the brightly lit tunnel?  He didn't see fit to meet us and tell us he was ready, he just ran right past us into the bandit camp.  After escaping the last batch of bandits, he told us very angrily:  &quot;Why didn't you follow me?  You're all a bunch of dumb newbies, and I'm not going to group with you anymore.&quot;<br><br>Me: &quot;Hey, some of us aren't newbies.  We never heard you say &quot;Follow me&quot; or &quot;I'm ready to go&quot; or anything like that.  We all thought you were still banking or meditating.  We wouldn't have done that to you on purpose!&quot;<br><br>So he left us.  We were all glad; however, between the outrageous camp theft and Jadl's strange behavior, the rest of our adventure was cloudy and dull.  Rawtooth, Doggans, Phanny and I went as far as Hollowshade Moor to find a suitable hunting challenge, but we found none.  We eventually split up, giving each other meager smiles and kind words before camping individually.<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Apr 24 10:46:47 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While contemplating our next move, Phanny caught sight of a similarly experienced fellow hanging out in Rivervale.&nbsp;&nbsp;She engaged him in conversation, hoping he would join us in Runnyeye.  He suggested we meet his friend Doggans, a halfling ranger, on the moon.  Since we didn't have any better plans, we agreed.<br><br>While waiting for the Nexus Scion to zip us up to Luclin, a couple of powerful casters buffed us like crazy!  They laughed and called us the &quot;Little Biggles.&quot;  I rolled my eyes but smiled too - it does sound pretty funny!  What is it about tall people that makes them think short people are &quot;cute?&quot;  I want to come up with some knee jokes to counter with.<br><br>I arrived at the rendezvous point before Phanny (she always drags her feet in Shadow Haven) and met Doggans and his Erudite enchanter friend, Huzyour.  While waiting for Phanny, two fellows ran past whose guild (Drunken Bandits) I have been wanting to join.  Those two were the first Drunken Bandits I had ever seen in person!  I flagged them down.  They asked if they could join us in our Recondite Bandit smashings, which was all right by us.<br><br>As a full party of six, we quickly decided that the camp across the wetfang pond would be more exciting.  Unlike last time, we had enough combined swordpower to enter the camp en masse instead of pulling bandits out a few at a time.  We gathered at their campfire and slaughtered continuously for a day or so.  The bodies stacked up around us like the Orc headquarters in Highpass!  We barely had time to eat or talk.  It was a blast!<br><br>Our party members were amusing and energetic.  Having two clerics around meant that neither one had to meditate constantly, a real treat for Phanny.  The Drunken Bandits, Dok and Zuruel, were as entertaining as I had expected.  I suspect I would fit into their guild just fine.  Unfortunately, their strict entrance requirements will require extra legwork on my part - but won't guarantee a spot for me.<br><br>The evening was definitely improved by friendly messages sent by friends - Potas and Renlaria.  Renlaria is a friend of Zargoth's; she introduced herself quite a while ago, and has been friendly ever since.  Renlaria suggested her own guild, the Sands of Time.  She said they were a service-oriented group; everyone was generous, hard working, and often silly.  That sounds pretty appealing, as does the lack of bureaucratic hoop-jumping.  They aren't as active as the Drunken Bandits; is that an advantage or a disadvantage?  I'm not sure.<br><br>Anyway, after no one had the energy for another bandit, Phanny and I said goodbye to everyone but Doggans.  We arranged to meet him the next time we are ready for more battling, hopefully in a few days.  He was a friendly chap, and willing to wait until we were ready.  I'm really looking forward to our next adventure!<br><br>Not only that, but I'm glad that we had some success after that awful Unrest experience.  It felt good that friends sent us greeting, and that I now have TWO guilds to consider.  Things are definitely looking up.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Apr 24 22:31:18 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As we approached Greater Faydark, a bard buzzed past and whistled appreciatively at us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he stopped, told us we were a strikingly cute pair of little ladies, and asked us to model our armor for him.  Surprisingly, he didn't sound like a cad at all!  Quite the contrary.  After we twirled around a bit, batted our eyelashes and giggled, he offered to run us to our destination.  We started to decline, but he kindly insisted to do us a favor.  He whipped out his little guitar and ran off, with Phanny and me in tow.  His song caused us to zoom faster than I have ever gone before in my life!  The spirit of wolf has nothing on this song!  WOW!  Phanny and I laughed all the way to Kelethin, dodging trees and unsuspecting wood elves.  This must be what a kite feels like.<br><br>At the lift to Kelethin, Phanny buffed our new friend very well.  We separated to settle our own bidnass... not long after that, we heard him shout, &quot;Good night everyone!  Especially to the lovely ladies Phreda and Phanny!&quot;  (Something like that, I can't remember his exact words.)  That was nice.  Oh, I wish I found out what his name was!  We never asked!<br><br>We're in Rivervale now, visiting the family and our training guilds.  We have other options for future destinations - Lake of Ill Omen, Highpass (the goblins couldn't hate me more anyway!), or maybe Everfrost.  I liked hunting elephants, and wooly mammoths are supposedly even bigger!  Yowza!<br><br>It would not be exaggerating to say we were demoralized by our fiasco in Unrest.  Phanny was in real danger of losing her right to cast her latest series of spells.  We have entered a nebulous period, feeling too weak for half of the world, and too strong for the other half.  I suppose this is what is called 'growing pains.'<br><br>To try to cheer ourselves up, Phanny and I got our hair done.  She now sports blonder hair, which is now pulled away from her face into twin buns with sticks holding them in place.  I also opted for the hair sticks, (fitting for a warrior that even her fashion accessories are sharp and potentially lethal!), but didn't dye my hair.

It is good to see your adventures are going so well, save the unfortunate events in Unrest.  (I know your pain well, my friend, believe me.)<br><br>I have had adventures in many places of late!  Recently, my good friend Goldiggin and I have been to such places as Upper Guk, Solusek's Eye, Permafrost, and the Rathe Mountains.  <br><br>Goldiggin and I have left the 7th Legion, mainly because so many members have gone, and few have joined.  We are now associated with a wonderful group called the Fallen Wolves.  Such a close knit family of friends!  Why within a weeks time, Goldiggin and I were in a regular group of six:  Ahmai the High Elf cleric of Tunare, Boebi the Ranger, Zorntok, beastlord of the Iksar, and Bristal, the Dwarf paladin of Brell invited Goldiggin and I into their &quot;pack&quot;.<br><br>This outstanding group has helped me to collect three of the four items I need to complete a quest for a staff much prized by wizards, the Staff of Temperate Flux.  I expect to acquire the last item very soon.<br><br>As for your adventures, I might advise you to try the Netherbian Lair in Luclin.  There are good challenges and money to be found.  I especially advise you to look for creatures called a Swarmcaller or Swarmleader (I'm terribly sorry, but I forget which carries the item I mention below.)  <br><br>One of these creatures is said to have a magical breastplate called Netherbian Chitin, which is harder then Fine Plate, if you can believe such a thing!  It is also considerably lighter, and is imbued with magical enchantments to make its wearer more powerful.  I strongly ugre you to get one of these, I promise you, you will be glad you did.<br><br>Warmest regards,<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Apr 12 16:31:13 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>35th Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Fallen Wolves</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc I don't do the EC flea market either... at least not to buy items.&nbsp;&nbsp;I may go there to sell. :-)<br><br>I haven't done much questing with Arjaizen before.  Anything beyond newbie quests requires that you are either far beyond the recommended level to perform it (if you plan to solo it,) or that you have a near full group to succeed.  Since I had few opportunities to do anything with a group for a long quest, I just didn't bother.<br><br>With the Fallen Wolves, it's like a new world has opened up.  They actually -wanted- to travel with me in pursuit of the quest!  We also acquired good experience in SolA, great cash in Rathe Mountains, and a fair amount of each in Permafrost.<br><br>Check the questing search engine on this site to find quests in any given level range for the class you want.  It can help to do a wish list of items you'd like to have, and see what it will take to get them.  That's what I did, and the Temp. Flux Staff was just what the wizard ordered. :-)<br><br>I wish you could join the Fallen Wolves too, my friend.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, after all this time, the Recondite bandits aren't much of a challenge anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagnor's Cauldron was chosen as our next destination.  <br><br>We stopped at the Felwithe bank momentarily, so I could trade my claws in for a Velium sword and an axe.  It is supposed to magically infuse me with the strength of a berserker if I use it, provided I am strong enough to wield it correctly.  I am on the verge of being able to use the magic on my weapons....  Might as well exchange my claws now so I don't have to come back, right?  Ohhhhh....<br><br>Dagnor's Cauldron looks like...  blue lint.  A large lake sits in the middle of it; goblin pirates scurry about.  We saw a camp with a human, elf and dwarf; one of them offered to heal us for free, but we had no need for it.  We killed a few goblins but quickly grew bored.  A couple of thwaps is all it takes to conquer the little green pirates.<br><br>A dwarf ran passed us, so I hailed him and asked him where we could find some action.  He told us, &quot;Unrest!  Follow me!&quot; and led us through Dagnor's Cauldron on the coast of the lake to a tunnel.  We thanked him heartily; his parting advice was, &quot;If you don't find the zombies outside to your liking, go into the haunted house.  The most terrible creatures rest in there.&quot;  All right!  Once again, our adventure sounds straight of a storybook!<br><br>Unrest was an abandoned mansion with zombies running around in the yard.  We found a topiary maze, but didn't want to get lost in it.  The zombies were very weak, so we headed into the house.  On the way there, we passed a giant ghost dwarf.... weird!  Phanny and I both did a double take.<br><br>Once inside the house, Phanny and I battled dark-boned skeletons and ghouls.  They hit surprisingly hard, and like to gang up on a girl.  Also, I discovered to my horror, my weapons were not nearly as effective as my claws.  I hadn't done so little damage since my 15th season.  And now I am 24!<br><br>We hid in a corner room while Phanny meditated.  While we waited people would scream in panic &quot;train to zone!&quot; every few minutes.  We could hear them from inside the house even!  The house, by the way, was very cool.  I was eager to explore more of it.  As soon as Phanny was ready, we ventured down a dark hallway.<br><br>Not 20 steps down the hall, a crowd of dark-boned skeletons tackled us.  We were nearly finished with them, and exhausted, when the ghost dwarf appeared from around the corner and attacked!  We tried to escape.  I died on the front porch of the house, and Phanny died a few feet ahead of me.<br><br>Determined to be more careful next time, we retrieved our corpses and settled in a small corner room next to the front door.  I would pull one or two monsters to Phanny instead of blithely wandering around the house.  Unfortunately, the place was empty of monsters except for a ball room - which was full of them!  No fewer than five skeletons and the ghost dwarf (who appeared with the skeletons AFTER I got their attention) chased me back onto the front porch and killed me.<br><br>Determined to be more careful next time, as well as being angry, frustrated, and bent on not letting the haunted house defeat us, we decided to stay on the front porch this time, and pull monsters from the front rooms while avoiding the ballroom and hallways.   This worked for a while....  However, during one fight, A third skeleton joined the two we were fighting, and killed me.  Phanny would have saved me, but at that moment a festering hag snuck up behind her and killed her with two hits.  Neither one of us actually saw her killer.  We died too quickly to turn around even.<br><br>The way we figured, even if we could have found a group of brave people to join us in the haunted mansion, no one party member could withstand such strong strikes from festering hags or ghost dwarves - not at our level of expertise anyway.  We grumbled our way back to our bodies once again, ran back to Lint World, and camped in the fluffy blue wilderness.<br><br>My next mission is to retrieve my claws.  It was a big mistake not bringing them with me.  The only question now is, where should we go next?<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yet again Phanny and I set out to tackle the bandit camp near Shadow Haven.&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the place was packed with other groups of hunters; there was no room for us.  I consulted a ruddy map I got from someone in the Bazaar, which indicated a second camp across the lake from the camp we were familiar with.  We decided to check it out.<br><br>This camp was empty of bandit hunters, and full of bandits!  The arrangement was perfect, except we needed one more person to ensure our survival in case of an all-out bandit attack.  Phanny contacted a lonely dwarf warrior, who met us at the outskirts.<br><br>Gnarf was his name.  He had the most fabulous pair of swords I had ever seen.  They made my nice claws seem paltry by comparison.  He was a nice guy though, and put his Centi longswords to good use.<br><br>As a team, we worked together well.  Between two warriors, a whole pack of angry bandits would be reduced to mincemeat in moments.  Phanny hardly had to heal us, and spent an unusual amount of time fighting them with us.  I pulled bandits out of the camp with my bow and arrows, and kept the flow almost constant.  It was a blast!<br><br>During one brief quiet time, Gnarf pulled out his fishing pole to try to get some wetfang fish for dinner.  His fishing line wouldn't go to the water though!  I laughed and said, &quot;I'll show you how to fish!&quot;, jumped in the water and tackled a wetfang with my bare hands (well, claws).  I accidentally shredded the fish beyond hope of bringing up a fillet, but I did grab one of its eyeballs back to my friends.  I offered it to Phanny to eat, but she wrinkled her nose up at it.<br><br>During another rest, I sang to them the (only) dwarf drinking song that I know.  They applauded and cheered and jumped for joy! That was a really great feeling!  I got some of the words wrong, but decided then and there to get the song all right and sing it to other people too.<br><br>After a long while, Gnarf had to leave to help some of this guildmates retrieve a corpse.  We said goodbye; he told us he hadn't had so much fun in a long, long time.  Cheers, Gnarf!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Mar 30 16:57:14 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>29 Warrior, Drunken Bandit<br><a href=HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/journal.html?user=122873 target=_new>Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl</a></td></tr>
