	   <tr><td colspan=2>After having completed my journey across the entire continent of Antonica, I decided to travel south to some of the lands I had never seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw many wondrous creatures such as centaurs, whom I regarded as particularly interesting.  They were absolutely graceful.<br><br>I made my way south to the enormous lake in the south known as Rathetear.  There I discovered a large number of adventurers heading toward the Rathe Mountains.<br><br>I hailed one tall barbarian who was hurrying east.<br><br>&quot;Pardon a stranger for interrupting your journey,&quot; I said to him.  &quot;I have seen many travellers heading East to the mountains.  Are you going there?  What is it that you seek there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, my short friend, I am going to the mountains,&quot; the tall warrior replied.  &quot;The outposts have been attacked by an army of hill giants.  Many of us are going to their aid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I am yet too inexperienced to take on a giant but I am sure I can help in some way.  May I accompany you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Come along then if you can keep up,&quot; he replied with a grin. <br><br>After having been forced to swim part of the way, we arrived in the pass that led from the lake to the mountains.  A small army representing all the races of Norrath were there.  I saw many old familiar faces.<br><br>The fight was not going well.  Apparently the giants vastly outnumbered those opposing them and they had slaughtered many groups of travellers and adventurers as well as the people of the outposts.  <br><br>Looking at the large number of wounded lying in the pass, I took out my pack full of bandages.  &quot;I may not be able to fight a giant, but it is my duty to help those in need,&quot; I told my barbarian companion.  &quot;Fare thee well, friend!&quot;<br><br>The barbarian joined a group of powerful warriors and casters that was heading into the mountains.  He waved goodbye as they disappeared from sight.  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue May 14 09:15:07 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After my long sojourn into Antonica, I was very happy to get back to Faydwer to rest and prepare for my next adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was especially happy to rest. I found my favorite fishing spot unoccupied and so I sat down to fish after puchasing a few bowls of worms for bait.  <br><br>I closed my eyes.  I was beginning to drift off to sleep when I heard a voice behind me.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me sir, but aren't you a member of the Knights of Shining Light?&quot;<br><br>I turned to see a young high elf in his distinctive green robe.  He seemed friendly enough even if he had interrupted my (almost) nap.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; I replied.  &quot;Is there something I can do for you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My name is Glitterhands.  I am an apprentice enchanter and jeweler.  I am offering my services to your guild, sir,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Are you someone I could speak to about joining or can you direct me to the correct person?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I am not in charge,&quot; I admitted.  &quot;But I can try to help out.  Let me send a letter of recommendation to the leaders of the guild and I promise to let you know when I receive a reply.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you sir.  You are most kind.&quot;  The elf bowed to me and wandered off to his own fishing spot nearby.<br><br>I returned to my spot and sat down.  I figured I would try to prepare some more food before my next adventure to Antonica.  Fish is always a good thing.  It preserved so well.  I wonder how my friend Boomba is doing?  Hopefully the Freeport Militia is not being too hard on him.<br><br>I frowned when I thought about that.  I had heard that they were led by a paladin who had become corrupted.  I wonder... could he be the same paladin that had betrayed my parents?  I had not thought of that possibility before.  I will have to find out more about this fellow, I decided.<br><br>My eyes began to droop again.  As I began to drift off to sleep I thought of beautiful young elves with their fair skin and their long hair and smiled.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Apr 18 15:42:03 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I had recently returned to my native land of Faydwer recently after a long campaign in Antonica that had lasted two whole seasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was looking forward to reporting my progress to my mentor Gunlok Jure and sharing a few pints with him.<br><br>After stepping of the boat I wandered past the guards near the entrance to the docks.  For some reason they did not wave to me as they usually did. <br><br>&quot;What is wrong with you?  Are holy warriors of Brell no longer welcome among their own people?&quot;<br><br>One of the guards lifted his visor and squinted his eyes at me.  &quot;Gorfrey is that you?&quot; he said as he gave a hearty dwarf laugh.  &quot;I did not even recognize you.  I see you have picked up some new armor.&quot;<br><br>After a few minutes of socializing, I waved goodbye to my friends and started my way down the trail to Kaladim.  Well, I must look differently, I thought.  After all I AM wearing my new armor of Ro and my new coif I thought proudly before I realized what I was doing.  I shook my head.  Humility, humility, humility, I harangued myself.  I was proud of my new armor but I couldn't let it go to my head.<br><br>As I pondered this I heard some rustling noises on the path in front of me.  I instinctively put my hand on the pommel of my sword as I looked more closely for the source of the noise ahead of me.  Cowering under a bush in front of me was a small dwarf holding a rusty Stormguard axe.  He was very dirty (even for a dwarf) and had obviously been in the woods for some time.<br><br>&quot;Come out of there, you,&quot; I ordered.  &quot;Why do you have a Stormguard axe?&quot;  I suspiciously eyed the dwarf from head to toe.  &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br><br>The dwarf looked at me nervously, like a child that had been caught with its hand in the cookie jar.  &quot;Err... it's Blyle Bundin, my lord.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait a moment,&quot; I said.  &quot;You are that guard that deserted his post, aren't you?&quot;  I quickly drew my sword.  &quot;You must learn there is a penalty for desertion.&quot;  <br><br>&quot;No, please!&quot; the smaller dwarf squealed.  &quot;Can't we discuss this?!?&quot;  He backed away from me.<br><br>&quot;If all guards were like you, who would protect the city from the goblins and orcs, you little fool?&quot; I angrily replied.  &quot;If you were going to be so cowardly and careless enough to desert, you should have been smart enough to go somewhere far away where you would not get caught.&quot;<br><br>Bundin turned and ran.  &quot;Help, help!&quot;  he cried.  &quot;I am being attacked!  Someone save me!&quot;<br><br>Nearby, two other members of the Stormguard (who did not know me as well) heard the cries for help and ran down the path.<br><br>&quot;Stop, you!&quot; they yelled.  &quot;In the name of the King!&quot;  <br><br>&quot;Yes, come get him!' I replied.  I turned to see them coming and I smiled.  Then I realized that they were ignoring Bundin and were coming at me with axes at the ready.<br><br>&quot;Not ME, you brainless heaps of ogre dung!  HIM!&quot;<br>The guards nonetheless pounced on me as Bundin disappeared down the trail.<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Apr 18 09:56:05 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Recently I decided to take a journey to visit some friends in Rivervale.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had never been to the halfling city before, and so I figured it was as good a time as any to make my way there.  <br><br>I set off across the commonlands of eastern Antonica and made my way through the dangerous Kithicor forest before arriving in the hospitable little town of Rivervale.  I had heard the fishing here was good and that the opportunities for drinking were excellent.  What more could I want?  I thought to myself.  Aside from perhaps some female company.  I cringed at the thought of dirty hairy feet.  Well, maybe not.<br><br>After a short stay in Rivervale, I made my way across the plains of Karana and finally arrived in Qeynos.  Not quite as bustling as Freeport, Queynos was still an interesting city nonetheless.  <br><br>On my way back to Highpass Hold, I had an encounter on the road.  A striking tall human female stepped out onto the path.  <br><br>&quot;Hello, my lady,&quot; I said with a smile.  &quot;Is there something I can do for you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why yes,&quot; she said with a beautiful smile.  &quot;You can hand over your money purse.&quot;  <br><br>I quickly realized I was surrounded by a sizeable group of female thieves, all tall and attractive.  Who would have thought?  I admitted.  I sighed and shook my head.<br><br>&quot;I am sorry to do this, my lady,&quot; I admitted as I quickly drew my sword.<br><br>A short time later, I stood over the corpses of the four bandits.  They had hardly made a scratch on me.  I said a quick prayer of thanks to Brell and then another for the gods to pity their souls.<br><br>Humans, I thought.  I will never understand them.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I stood in the Hall of Truth in Freeport, my new armor gleaming from the hard scrubbing I had given it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew I had to look presentable.  I did not want these human and half-elf paladins to think that a dwarf was not dignified enough to meet with them.<br><br>&quot;Greetings, young paladin,&quot; said the tall human standing in front of me.  &quot;Do you know why you have been called before us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, my lord,&quot; I admitted.  &quot;I received a letter from Gunlok Jure, who instructed me to report here to you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, we have a letter from him as well,&quot; said another paladin, this one a human female.  &quot;He has told us who you are, and more importantly, who your father was.&quot;  She smiled knowingly.<br><br>&quot;You knew my father?&quot; I asked incredulously.  Now they had my attention.<br><br>&quot;A very powerful paladin, your father.  His name was Amaral Bellhewer.  We knew him because we fought at his side in many battles.  We have something that belonged to him.  It was his wish to pass it on to you when you were old enough and when you had earned the right to carry it as a holy warrior of renown.  You have recently helped slay Emperor Crush and many dozens of his minions.  For this, we think you are ready.&quot;<br><br>Another paladin walked up with a large box.  He opened it to reveal an enormous sword.<br><br>&quot;This belonged to your father.  The Argent Defender is its name.  With this weapon your father slew many a foe.  When he died he asked us to keep it for you so that you may have it when the time was right.&quot;<br><br>I stared at the weapon.  I was awed into silence.  I struggled to find the words to express what I felt.<br><br>&quot;I never knew my parents.  I never even knew their names.  What of my mother?&quot;<br><br>The two elder paladins looked at each other.  One nodded at the other before speaking.<br><br>&quot;Your mother was a great healer, Gorfrey,&quot; she said.  &quot;Her name was Jenette Bellhewer.  She had gone to try to resurrect your father after he fell in battle.  No one ever saw either one of them again.  We are truly sorry.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly I felt strangely.  I had always believed that I had become a paladin by accident rather than by fate.  What did all of this mean?<br><br>&quot;I too wish to be great, as my parents were before me,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wish to earn a place by the side of Brell Serilis.  What must I do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is for you to figure out for yourself, young paladin,&quot; the male human said with a smile.  &quot;But know this - we believe your parents' deaths were a deliberate act of one of our order who betrayed them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And betrayed us as well,&quot; the female added.  &quot;We will tell you more when the time comes and you are ready.  For now, you must seek out evil wherever it lies.  Your heart is pure, although not perfect.  Follow your own conscience and see where it takes you.  That is all for now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fare thee well, fellow paladin,&quot; they said before they turned and left the room.<br><br>I walked outside.  The cool night air and the sound of running water were soothing to me as I thought about all I had learned. I studied the schools of small minnows swimming about.<br><br>&quot;I will find my parents.  Brell help me, I will find them and give them a proper burial if I cannot have them raised from the dead.  And I will find those responsible for their deaths.&quot;<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Apr 10 10:45:57 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Perhaps there is no area in all of Faydwer that I dread as much as the Lesser Faydark.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is utterly overrun by all sorts of frightening creatures that do not hesitate to attack anyone they see.  Perhaps the most horrible of all these, and the most tragic as well, is Equestrielle.  At one time she was a beautiful unicorn that dwelled in the forest with the other unicorns.  Until someone took her horn, and with it went everything about her that was pure and full of joy.  Evil so corrupted her that her very color changed from white to a dark black.  Now she travels throughout the forest wreaking havoc on all who are unfortunate enough to cross her path.<br><br>Including me.  And my companions.<br><br>I do not remember much that happened that night.  We had let our guard down and suddenly she appeared.  She killed us all in less time that it takes Furtog Ogrebane to down a mead.  <br><br>Although I hunt the undead, I do not hate them.  I pity them.  They cannot help it that the forces of darkness have raised them from the dead and twisted their rotting bodies for their own foul purposes.  Their souls are in torment and it is my duty to free them.  <br><br>I think perhaps this analogy can be extended to this poor creature of the forest.  After I was raised from the dead I vowed that when able I would return to the Faydark with the express purpose of putting this suffering animal out of its misery.  <br><br>I pray to Brell that it will not be long.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Apr  4 10:20:21 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

She was full of life and happiness, but there was no real purpose or direction in her life other than her insistence on living in the moment.  I sighed.  It is just as well, I thought.   I cleared my thoughts of the sultry wood elf out of my head and decided to focus on the matter at hand.  I was on my way to a guild meeting near Freeport.  I was already wondering if I was going to be late.  <br><br>Ahead of the ship dark clouds were looming.  How appropriate, I thought.  The sea is in tune with my dark mood.  Thunder rolled in from the west.  <br><br>&quot;You best be heading below, young paladin,&quot; a sailor warned me.  &quot;It is going to get rough soon.&quot;  He grinned. &quot;I hope you haven't got a full stomach.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The din inside Irontoe's Eats was almost deafening.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rarely had such a large crowd been seen in the place.  I could see Trumpy was grinning from ear to ear.  I guess the money he was making would more than make up for the cost of new furniture.<br><br>I stood nervously by the bar.  I was waiting for Cleonae to show up.  She was supposed to meet me here and had not yet arrived.  <br><br>&quot;Well, do my eyes deceive me?  Is that the little tyke I used to know?&quot; the bellowing voice of Furtog Ogrebane called out behind me.<br><br>I turned and saluted him.  The grizzled old warrior walked up and playfully punched me in the shoulder.  &quot;How about treating your old friend to a few ales?&quot;  <br><br>&quot;Another round over here, Trumpy,&quot; I called out to the proprietor.  He obliged me by bringing four tankards over to the table.  Furtog gleefully grabbed one and downed it before Trumpy had even set them all down.  <br><br>&quot;I hear you got rid of those two ogres, Corflunk and Zarchoomi,&quot; Furtog said with a grin.  &quot;Gunlok has trained you well.  For a worthless paladin.&quot; he said with a jest.  <br><br>&quot;Yes, although it took me a while to find Zarchoomi.  Byzar said he didn't want just one head, so I had to keep Corflunk's head until I got hers as well.  It was nice and ripe by the time I was able to turn both of them in.  The dwarves at the bank were not happy with me.  They said it will take some time to get the stink out of the vault.  I even had to get them to replace my deposit box.&quot;<br><br>By this time, Furtog had downed all of the ales I had just bought, even the one I had started drinking myself.  He then proceeded to take two more off the table next to us.  <br><br>&quot;What are you doing, you thoughtless fool?&quot;  the dwarf at the table said with a start.  He and his buxom but heavily bearded date did not look happy. <br><br>Furtog jumped out of his chair and slugged the dwarf square in the face, knocking him backward so hard that the chair underneath him broke into three pieces.  The dwarf's female companion proceeded to grab her own chair and break it over Furtog's head.<br><br>&quot;Here we go again,&quot; I groaned.  <br><br>Just then, a beautiful young elf strode through the door.  She had just taken off her cloak as an empty Kalish bottle went sailing past her.  She ducked and then looked at me in wonder.<br><br>&quot;Umm... maybe we should try going somewhere else,&quot; I offered to her.  &quot;This place is getting a little rowdy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think that would be a good idea,&quot; Cleonae replied.  The two of us walked out the door just as the last of the furniture was turned into flying splinters against the far wall.  We picked up our pace as we headed down the tunnel.  The sound of breaking glass and dwarven profanity slipped away.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The bustle of West Freeport never ceases to amaze me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the nasty looks I got from some of the guard of the Freeport Militia, I always enjoy coming to the human city to shop and socialize when travelling between Faydwer and Antonica.<br><br>The crowds seemed to consist of every race on Norrath.  Normally I studied the crowd carefully as I walked through the city.  However, today the endless sea of strangers swirled around me unnoticed as I sampled the latest culinary creation of the smiling ogre that towered over me.  Who would have imagined that a dwarf and an ogre would get along so well? I thought with an inward chuckle.<br><br>&quot;Boomba,&quot; I said, &quot;no one makes pickles like you.  Not even me.&quot;  I smiled at the ogre, who seemed pleased.  I took another bite of the pickled pixie.  Delicious!<br><br>&quot;Me make good pickle, yes?&quot;  he replied with a toothy grin.  He walked over to his kettle where he was working on yet another batch of pickles.  &quot;Me like you, Gorfrey.  Me show you how make you pickles better.&quot;  He suddenly stopped and eyed me suspiciously.  &quot;You no try to steal Boomba's business?&quot;<br><br>I shook my head and laughed.  &quot;Boomba, you know I could never make pickles as good as yours.  Besides, I don't think many of the locals like me as much as you.  You're a real institution around here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What dat?&quot;  Boomba scratched his head at my big words.<br><br>&quot;People know you, Boomba, and they like you.  I just don't see myself selling dwarf pickles or paladin pickles.&quot; I said half jokingly, half seriously.  &quot;Now, what's your secret ingredient for the bixie pickles?  Come on, you can tell me -I will keep it to myself.  I'll even give you some of my recipes in trade.&quot;<br><br>Boomba scratched his head again, looking about as thoughtful as was possible for an ogre.  &quot;Me like you snake pickles.  You show Boomba how make snake pickles, me show you how make bixie pickles.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Deal,&quot; I said with a handshake.  This place really isn't so bad, I thought to myself.  Too bad the Militia has control over most of the city.  Their corruption was rampant and widespread.  I had even heard stories about how members of the militia worked with the dark races to overthrow the paladins and clerics in the Northern Freeport.  If they succeeded, what would happen to Boomba and all the other honest merchants?  I shuddered at the thought.<br><br>&quot;I will see you again soon, Boomba.  Remember, the pickles taste better when you wash your hands more often,&quot; I sternly reminded him.<br><br>Boomba rolled his eyes at me.  &quot;Boomba hands no dirty,&quot; he said as I watched him scratch himself in a very personal place, and then start stirring his pickle pot again.  I cringed.  My stomach started to rebel. I have to remember not to buy any of the next batch of orc pickles, I thought.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Mar 27 09:00:57 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I squinted my eyes as I tried to find the telltale opening in the side of the dune.&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the dungeon was hidden in the sands near the boundary between the open fields of the Commonlands and the seemingly endless dunes of the Desert of Ro.  I had only been here once before and it was a difficult place to find.<br><br>There! I thought as I spied the gaping rectangular hole that marked the passageway.  Found it!<br><br>I stood up and made my way down the dune to the cave entrance.  Standing there waiting for me was an old friend.<br><br>&quot;Hail, Texxan, and well met!&quot; I clasped the hand of the towering human.<br><br>&quot;It has been a long time, my short friend,&quot; said Texxan with a smile.  &quot;How have you been?&quot;  <br><br>I shrugged.  &quot;As well as can be expected, considering the circumstances.  I recently left my guild.  I was facing expulsion anyway.  And yet, it still feels strange, as if I had failed somehow.&quot;  My voice trailed off. <br><br>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; the taller paladin said with authority.  &quot;You have not failed.  Those of us who wished to continue together have formed a new guild.&quot;  Texxan paused.  &quot;We would like you to join us.  We know your heart is good.  We may not serve the same gods, you and I, but we serve the same purpose.  Those of us who seek to rid Norrath of evil should always work together.&quot;<br><br>I nodded thoughtfully.  &quot;I think something had happened to the leadership of the Legions of Might.  What was it?  Ambition?  Greed?  When did the attainment of titles and material things become more important than serving the needs of others?  I don't understand.&quot; I lamented.  <br><br>&quot;Many of us had seen this coming, sadly enough,&quot; said Texxan with a pained look on his scarred but still handsome face.  &quot;We did what we could to try to prevent it, but it was to no avail.  Still, there is much work for us to do.  We must press on and put the pettiness of these things behind us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; I agreed with newly found purpose.  &quot;Which brings us here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Grettings, old friend,&quot; said another voice in the shadows of the cave.  &quot;Are you ready to cleanse this place of the undead and their evil masters?  There are many souls here to be freed.&quot;<br><br>My jaw dropped.  &quot;Faeelan, is that you?&quot;  I said with astonishment.  &quot;Great Brell, I have not seen you in many seasons!&quot;  <br><br>The second human paladin smiled.  &quot;It is good to see you again, Gorfrey.  Will you join us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, by Brell's might, yes!  When do we begin?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;Soon.  The rest of the guild will be here soon and we will organize ourselves into several parties of five or six apiece.  I think you will see a great many familiar faces, my friend,&quot; said Texxan with a smile.   &quot;Consider yourself a member of the Knights of Shining Light from this day forward.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am in your debt, my old friends.  Thank you for this new chance to prove myself.&quot;  I knew I would not let them down.  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Mar 20 23:16:46 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

I will try harder.&quot;  I offered as I raised my sword again, showing I was ready.<br><br>This went on for some time, until Gunlok Jure finally felt satisfied enough with my progress to let me rest.  <br><br>Sitting down to eat in the great hall, the paladin trainer looked at me and shook his head.  &quot;You have much to learn, Gorfrey.  Much more training and experience you need.  And have you practiced your blacksmithing?  Or your brewing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, master,&quot; I confessed.  &quot;I have been working on other things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What other things?&quot; he asked.  &quot;What could be more important to a dwarf than brewing and blacksmithing?&quot;  His eyes narrowed.  &quot;What have you been doing when not fighting?&quot;<br><br>I am sure I must have looked a little nervous.  I cannot fool this dwarf.  <br><br>&quot;Well, master, I have been fishing a lot... and making arrows and bows.  And also...&quot; I hesitated, dreading telling him what I had been doing.<br><br>&quot;Also what?&quot; his eyes narrowed.  <br><br>&quot;Cooking, master.&quot; <br><br>Gunlok choked on his ale.  Spitting it out on the floor, he gasped &quot;What?!?  You have been COOKING?!?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, master.&quot;  My shoulders sank at his reaction.  &quot;I thought I would be more self-sufficient in my travels if I did not have to depend on others for food.  You know I have bad experiences at inns for some reason.  And Cleonae likes my cooking&quot;  My eyes briefly went wide when I realized my confession.  <br><br>Gunlok sank back into his chair.  He audibly sighed as he stared at me.  I stared at the floor.<br><br>&quot;Gorfrey, the life of a paladin is not easy.  One must make sacrifices if you are to be a true servant of Brell Serilis.  I agree one must be self-sufficient in many respects.  However, spending a lot of time with a female... cooking for her,&quot; he said with a disapproving tone, &quot;will not help you make your way down the path to becoming a true holy warrior.&quot;<br><br>I must have been visibly saddened, for Gunlok sighed again and gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder.<br><br>&quot;I have seen your bow.  You have become very skilled in bowyering.  It is truly a fine weapon,&quot; he agreed.  &quot;However, I am unsettled by your lack of interest in these other important dwarven skills.  You must resolve to practice them more often.  Being able to forge your own armor and weapons will be important later in your life.&quot;<br><br>I nodded silently in agreement.  The older and wiser dwarf handed me another tankard of ale.  <br><br>&quot;Now, you are ready to go out into the world again.  Return to me after another season and we will see how you have improved.&quot;<br><br>I nodded again.  &quot;I will do my best, master.&quot;<br><br>&quot;By the way, who is Cleonae?&quot; Gunlok inquired.  &quot;Such an unusual name for a dwarf.&quot;<br><br>Now it was my turn to choke on my ale.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Mar  5 09:47:28 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A few days ago I walked into the Pub Kal in my native city of Kaladim.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been away far too long.  I had spent many months in the common lands and deserts of Antonica.  It is a large continent, much bigger than Faydwer,  and although I marvel at its beauties and wondrous creatures, I am always glad to be home.  I dropped my packs and weapons in front of the bar.  Dust and sand scattered across the floor.<br><br>&quot;Well, it is young Gorfrey again... we had wondered if a griffin had carried you away.  You want your usual?&quot;  The barkeep offered a mischievous grin.<br><br>&quot;Absolutely, my usual,&quot; I laughed as I clapped him on the shoulder, knowing that my usual way of ordering ale was &quot;something cold and alcoholic, if you please&quot;. <br><br>Handing me a foaming tankard of dwarven ale, he said &quot;Made this batch m'self... oh, there was someone lookin' fer you earlier... a courier or messenger of some type.&quot;<br><br>Just then a young dwarf burst into the tavern, breathlessly announcing he had a message for Gorfrey.  I took the scroll with the wax seal of the Legions of Might from him and opened it up, wondering what sort of message from the guild could be so important.<br><br>It was a letter from the leadership of my guild, the Legions of Might.  It informed me that many of the younger members of the guild, including myself, were facing expulsion.  I was absolutely stunned.  What had I done to deserve this?  What had any of us done?  Why were we suddenly deemed unworthy of association with these elder citizens of Norrath?  Was it something we had failed to do?  Placing my silver on the bar, I left without a word.  I am sure my expression spoke volumes.  My mind reeling and my mood plummeting, I wandered outside of the city to sit and think.  <br><br>Having been an orphan, I realized that the thought of losing the only family I have ever known is perhaps more than I can bear.  <br><br>Not knowing what else to do, I buckled on my armor, checked my packs, and sharpened my sword.  I decided that if there was any doubt that I was not worthy of the Legion of Might, I would have to make sure that it was erased.  I decided that I will prove myself a worthy servant of Brell Serilis, and hope that it would prove my worth to my fellow members of the Guild as well. <br><br>As I hurried past the guard hut, one of them called out &quot;Where are ye goin' in such a big hurry?  Ya just got back!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'll be back again,&quot; I called out. <br><br>I hope so. <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Feb 26 17:24:03 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I do not remember much of my early childhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being orphaned at an early age, I spent a considerable amount of time as a child being unsupervised.  I would run through the mines chasing rats and watching the miners at their work.  Once while chasing a rat I fell into the water in the mines.  I was horrified, not only at the fact that I could not swim, but also at the terrible similarity between swimming and bathing.  However, necessity overruled my baser instincts and I found myself taking the time to learn to swim, even when fully clothed.  I quickly discovered that learning to swim made me more acceptable of the idea of bathing, much to my surprise.  I also discovered that bathing made me more acceptable to many elves, particularly of the female persuasion.<br><br>Sometimes I wonder how I did not become a thief.  Poverty can be a terrible handicap, especially when one has little purpose or direction in life to offset it.  <br><br>Not having anything better to do, I decided to leave my home city and explore Faydwer.<br><br>As a young dwarf, I witnessed a terrible sight - another young dwarf being attacked and killed by a group of skeletons.  I had never seen such a horrible and bloody sight.  It was then that I realized my true calling in life.  I vowed to myself and to Brell Serilis that I would dedicate my life to the extermination of the undead and the overthrow of evil.<br><br>I had two exceptional teachers that trained me.  The first was a fellow dwarf named Gunlok Jure in the Underfoot Citadel.  He encouraged me in my quest against the undead by giving me advice, training, weapons, armor, money and anything else he could spare to help me.  I owe him a great debt for his generosity and careful instruction.<br><br>The second and most unusual fellow who helped me was an elf named General Jyleel Vad.  This fellow holy warrior encouraged me to not forget that the orcs were also making massive inroads into both Faydwer and the Butcherblock Mountains, theatening both the elves and the dwarves.  I have frequently told that although I drink like a dwarf, I speak like an elf.  For this, I can thank the General for his personal instruction on diction and grammar.  His efforts to transform an unkempt young dwarf into a polished holy knight of Brell Serilis have so far been largely successful.  He has even managed to help me control my temper and my profanity, something which I may never have managed otherwise.  <br><br>Thus have I become unusual in my speech, my personal habits, and in my choice of associates.  However, I have not forgotten who I am.  I am a dwarf.  I will always be a dwarf.  <br><br>Brell be praised.  Pass the ale!<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Feb 20 11:38:07 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I love life underground.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, there is something very appealing to me about the woods of Faydwer, particularly the Faydark. <br><br>I think perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I find both Kelethin and Felwithe to be friendly places for a dwarf to visit.  Kelethin has some great taverns, where the service is good and the variety of brews is wide.  All Kelethin really needs is a good place to go fishing.  Felwithe has stunning architecture, a Paladin guild where I am welcomed as a brother, and of course the fishing is good. <br><br>Of course, being of an age when I am beginning to think of such things, I find myself drawn to the beautiful and nubile young elf maidens in these cities.  Is it wrong?  Is it weak?  I do not know the answer.  I pray for guidance and hope that I do not stray from my path of holy combat in the name of Brell Serilis.  Perhaps, when my beard has grayed and I no longer have the strength to buckle on my armor, I will think about settling down.<br><br>Such foolish thoughts.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Not long ago, while enjoying a foaming tankard of dwarven ale at Irontoe's Eats in my native city of Kaladim, I received an invitation to a wedding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having never attended any type of social event before, I decided that surely I could spare the time to attend the ceremony, particularly since drinking was sure to be involved afterward. <br><br>I boarded the ship for the long journey across the ocean to Freeport, where the wedding was held.  The ride was not pleasant, particularly since it stormed almost the entire voyage.  <br><br>After several days I arrived in Freeport.  I am always impressed with the sheer size and business of this human city.  I wandered over to the Theater of the Tranquil, wherethe ceremony was about to begin. It was a magnificent spectacle.  Dozens of members of the Legions of Might were in attendance for the wedding of two of our own: Texxan and Xavieras.  Being of short stature (of course), I proceeded to find a spot in front where I could see clearly.  The ceremony was short, which was good, as I could hear the ales in my backpack sloshing around as I squirmed with impatience.  <br><br>After the ceremony was over, there was much dancing and drinking.  Not having much use for dancing, I proceeded to consume a large amount of beer, ale, wine, and anything else I could get my hands on.  It was a grand time.<br><br>But enough of that.  There was much work to be done.  I proceeded to the Commonlands, where I had heard there was a large population of undead that needed to have their souls released.  I am just the dwarf for the job.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Feb 12 10:29:56 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>When I was a younger dwarf, I never travelled very far from my home city of Kaladim. Despite being an orphan I always felt at home with my fellow dwarves. This was fine when I was younger, but as I grew older I realized that I was facing a crossroads in my life as a holy warrior of Brell.&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that the skeletons and goblins I had been fighting were no longer presenting a challenge worthy of the name, and that the only way to find more dangerous opponents was to travel.  Thus, when I head that the orcs were making great inroads into the territory of the elves in the Faydark, I decided to pack up my belongings, including my precious fishing pole, and head to the land of the elves.  <br><br>After spending some time exploring the majesties of Kelethin and Felwithe (where the fishing was good I might add) I headed north to the edge of the Faydark, where the orcs had created a cesspool called Crushbone.  I quickly joined up with a group of strangers who all had the same idea as me - fight the orcs in the heart of their lair.  It was here that I first met members of a group called the Legion of Might.<br><br>Our little party fought our way through the guards and into the castle of the Crushbone king himself.  Fleeing like the little coward we know him to be, the king screamed like a child for his guards to save him as we chased him out of his throne room.  Despite the efforts of every orc in the castle, and even including that evil dark elf D'Vinn, we triumphed and left a trail of bodies wherever we went.<br><br>After our glorious victory, a beautiful young elf (whose name excapes me, much to my regret) asked me if I would join her guild, the Legions of Might.  I gratefully accepted her offer, and ever since I have felt as if I had truly found a place that felt like family.  They encouraged me to seek out new adventures, and helped me countless times along the way.  Brave Faeelan,  beautiful Kylanandora, generous Hathgar, fatherly Texxan, motherly Xavieras, kind Tiburones, and the many countless other Legionnaires who have helped me throughout the recent trials and tribulations of my travels on Antonica.  I owe you my deepest thanks.  I pledge my eternal loyalty to all of you and to the Legion.  May Brell always travel with you and help you find your way.<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jan 28 14:47:23 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>In the course of my travels, I have noticed that there are a great many friendly elves of all types that are more than willing to assist a traveler such as myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many is the time I have enjoyed the company of elves, whether it is in battle or at the local tavern.<br><br>Having said that, I have also noticed that there are a great many Dark Elves that take a disliking to me, despite the fact that they have not even taken the time to get to know me.  Various fellows all around Norrath have decided that they would much rather bury their daggers in my back rather than take the time to have a pleasant conversation with the likes of little old me.  That Ambassador D'Vinn fellow, Kizdean Gix, Dragoon Zytl, and various shadowknights and other nefarious individuals have all attacked me with little provocation.  Luckily Brell Serilis has guided me through many close calls with death, and even carried me back to my corpse to be born again on several occasions.  Praise be to Brell.<br><br>Thus, I can only come to the conclusion that despite my own desire to get along with everyone, I must draw a line somewhere.  Therefore, my rule of thumb when meeting dark elves is going to be hack first, ask questions later.  <br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

May you serve your god well in dispatching those poor creatures from this realm, and sending them to the rest they no doubt deserve.<br><br>Watch out for the sand giants in North Ro, however.  They pack quite the punch.<br><br>Fare well, and good journeys to you.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jan 22 12:33:20 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>37th Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Fallen Wolves</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Having finally mustered up the courage to travel far away from home, I got on a ship that carried me to a city called Freeport.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was huge.  Lots of things to see and the people are very friendly.  Except the guards.  For some reason, they don't seem to like me although at least they haven't attacked me yet.  <br><br>Once outside the city, I proceeded to travel east into an area where there was a large population of creatures I had never seen before.  The guild masters in Kaladim had told me about zombies and mummies, but I had never seen one.  I proceeded to hack them up into little pieces of quivering rotting flesh.  <br><br>I owe much to the members of my guild, the Legion of Might, who helped me countless times on my journey through the area.  On several occasions I was atacked by evil Dark Elves and was forced to retreat, but the members of my guild helped me with gifts of magic weapons and healing me when I was injured.  <br><br>I am now in my 16th season, and hope to complete several more while I am in Antonica.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Mar 26 16:36:24 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

Gleefully I thank Brell Serilis for my good fortune and I proceed to shoot an few arrows at the little green casters to get their attention.  After they run out at me, I then chop them into fish bait.  Sigh.  If only they carried more cash.  <br><br>A lot of people love me because I kill every goblin I see, no matter what.  If someone else is killing a goblin, I proceed to heal them as much as I can while they ae fighting, so that they are sure to win against the little green ones.
