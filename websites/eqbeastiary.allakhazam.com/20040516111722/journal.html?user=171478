Half Elf Ranger.

My Mother is Human, a lady-in-waiting to a minor noblewoman. My Father is an Elven Ranger, who served the nobleman for a time. It was a time of war, and of arranged marraiges between the minor nobility. While my mother cared for her husband, she was drawn to this foreign warrior, and discretion was thrown to winds. Things could not continue of course, and when the current hostilities ceased, my Mother and Father parted, each to pursue their chosen ways of life.

The nobleman's Holding was near Elven Lands and there is much Elven blood in the Human population of the area. So my Elven features went  unremarked, and caused no gossip, when I was born 8 months after my Mother's Human husband returned from war.

When I reached adulthood, I had a chance encounter with a seeress. She saw the truth of my lineage, and the whereabouts of my Father were revealed to her, and to me. With my mother's blessing, but in secret as my true parentage must remain unrevealed, I journed many a long day to Surefall Glade. I made myself known to my father, and was accepted. It was he who instructed me in the ways of the Ranger.

And now I journey the lands of Norrath as a Ranger, like my Father.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center>

So beside accumulating (hopefully) a creel full of fresh fish, I decided to fish in the Qeynos Hills, hoping to come upon Hadden and his breath giving earring. <br><br>I arrived as the dawn was just rising over the hills. The waters of the lake were calm and most importantly, the shores were empty of humanity. The fish were biting, and water was refreshing. Just as I was running out of bait, after only three hours of blissful (&nbsp;&nbsp;) fishing, there he was, staring at me from across the lake. <br><br>I lured him away from his pals with a bribe of fresh fish, and a spelled snare about his ankles, and after minmal resistance, I found myself the proud owner of his reknowned earring.

My tracking skills were in full use, my eyes scanning the ground and skies for signs that snow griffins had been about. <br><br>And at last, after so many hunting excursions I can't even remember them all, there they were. A flock of snow griffins, scattered all about the wastes, near where the sleeper lay. I can't recall ever seeing so many about at one time. So many I slew one after the other until, in no time, I had the four eggs I needed, along with some extras in case of breakage. <br><br>The kitchens were next and while my culinary skills are improving, it was not certain that the souffle would not collapse when removed from the oven. But it remained whole, and was enjoyed by Grand Historian Thoridain. He was so appreciative he praised, <br><br>'My compliments, Donilla, what a wonderful dish! Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you power over your adversaries.&quot; <br><br>It was hard to give up that seal, as it contained properties that would have been of use to me, but I headed to Loremaster Borannin and gave to him the seal and the cloth prayer shawl. Much to my surprise I was given back the seal, along with the woven prayer shawl to drape across my shoulders as I continue on my quest for the ultimate prayer shawl.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

We began our treacherous ascent up the ramps and narrow bridges, fighting our way past spiders, guardians and the other cyrstalline monsters dwelling in this icy world. <br><br>One wrong step and I started to slide, close to the edge, and then over, falling down into the depths below. I picked myself up as the spiders swarmed over my bruised body. A drink of a gate potion and I was safe. I made my way back to the labyrinth as my companions continued their battle upwards into the kobold camp, down the well, and into the caves below. <br><br>Two of my companions, Pheermee and Miserable, awaited my return. We began our trek, taking a different route in order to reach another stranded mate. Meanwhile the main group continued to make their way through the caves below. <br><br>Our smaller band reached Arabus, and we continued upwards until we reached a dead end. We had to retrace our steps, now heading down the slippery ramps we had just finished climbing. We eventually reached a castle with crystal statue guardians, but were unable to get our gnomes up and over the ice barrier in front of the fortress. We could continue no further in this direction. <br><br>Meanwhile the main group had run into difficulty and with the skill of the magic users amongst them, were able to evacuate safely to the entrance. Our smaller party made it's back as well, and soon the companions were together again. <br><br>It was decided that we would make a second assault on Velk, and off we went. Down the icy corridors, up the slippery slopes. And once again misfortune befell me. A mis-step over a collapsed section of walkway and I found myself sprawled on a bridge one level below. An attack by a crystal spider pushed me off the bridge, and again I found myself in a pit, embattled and separated from my friends. There was no time for a drink of potion, and Sneglars valiant attempt to rescue me came too late. <br><br>There were those among us with the gift of resurrection and soon I was back with the party. They had taken the precaution of dragging my corpse up the icy ramps so I would not have to risk falling again. A wise precaution since my skill on this adventure seemed to be sorely lacking. To say that I feared every step I took, is to understate my trepidation, as we went one by one down the sliding ramps, over and down an icy ledge, and inched our way around a large cavern ledge. A pass through an invisible doorway and we were in the camp of the Kobolds, where we proceeded to slaughter it's inhabitants to clear our path to the caverns below. <br><br>With the way now clear, we crept into the caves behind the camp. I followed the group into an shimmering waterfall that feed into a stone well and found myself in an airless tube with only a waterstone to provide air for my straining lungs. We emerged into the paths and caverns below, where magical traps and frozen denizens awaited us, determined to prevent us from traveling towards our goal, the Monk in charge of this area, Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar.

Ill Omen indeed, and I struggled, stirring up more mud, making the darkness even more complete. Hoping that both my invisiblity spell and my enduring breathe spell would hold, I carefully swam behind numerous bloodgills and other denizens of the deep, until finally, there is was, a stairway, covered with seaweed, appearing out of the gloom. <br><br>I swam thru, and seeing a glimer of light, headed up to find myself in a big ruined space, with a waterfall caused by a breech in the ceiling. And yet, that space remained filled with air, a miracle I had hoped for, but dared not count on. <br><br>I was met by Gluweyens and Miserable, and we navigated the corridors invisible as ghosts until we arrived at the spot they had staked out for their hunting. The orignal inhabitants of this sunken place would never have imagined the creatures that now wandered thru their city.

After restoring my life, we snuck down hallways and passages filled with the undead, and then with the living, and made our way once again thru the murky depths of the Lake. I was very happy to step onto the sands of the beach, and thankful to come out alive after the end of yet another new adventure. <br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

It wasn't just the cold causing me such discomfort. It was also the knowledge of the task that awaited me when I got there. My friend Peano, and his mates from Crimson Fist needed assistance, and I answered the call, knowing that death and destuction were likley to be my only reward. <br><br>We were heading into the lair of Lady Vox, with 18 steadfast and fearless adventurers. We gathered at the staging area, ensuring that all the local frost giants were no longer impeeding our progress. We headed in and up the ramps, and instantly, misfortune hit us. Some fell into the traps set to catch the unwary. Many, many other fell victim to the dragon herself when she inexplicably ventured out from her lair, accompanied by frost giant bodyguards. It was a slaughter, and recovering from the catastrophe took quite awhile, so long that 6 of our party were no longer able to continue. A vote was taken, and in our insanity, we elected to make another attempt at the Lady. <br><br>We engaged the dragon full force, but her ability to fear caught many of us, sending us running in terror thru icy hallways, past blocks of ice containing other unfortunate advertures. We could only hope that we would not meet such a fate. We kept returning, and running in terror, and returning, until the last, when Lady Vox called in reinforcements, and we were overrun by bears and spiders. This spelled our doom. After this recovery we felt we could do no more, and thankful for our reserrected lives, we slinked out of the castle, leaving the Lady Vox alive in her lair. <br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

I had labored long and hard, finally reaching a milestone in my hero education. It was time to leave the safety and comfort of the Planes of Knowledge, and explore the higher planes of existence. With much trepidation, I touched the stone leading to the Plane of Tranquility, and I soon found myself wandering amongst dragons, rings of stones filled with elementals, fantastic buildings, and much else that was strange and fantastic. I learned from talking to the inhabitants that these creations were in fact portals to the lands of the Gods and the elements, and that I must earn my right to travel in those domains. <br><br>A few of these &quot;planes&quot; however, were open to me, and I journeyed to an area where justice and law was said to rule all. I entered a graveyard, filled with corpses and devices of toture. It would seem that justice here was both swift and terrible. But was it just? This was something I would have to determine for myself, and I soon came to the conclusion that something was amiss in this land of law, and it was necessary to us heros in training to expend a bit of righteousness of our own.<br><br>I will be returning here when I can, and hopefully, with the help of my fellow Norrathians, we will be able to restore to justice it's true meaning. <br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

It was agreed we would forge on and after getting everyone together, we headed in through the iron gates into the castle. We ventured through the hallways, and carefully walked up the crystal ramps, killing the undead things along the way. Our was was now barred as we could not open the door to continue, so it was necessary to take an alternate route.<br><br>We came at last to the upper ramparts of the castle and it was now time to test our jumping skills. The first jump was to the top of the flag/banner, the second to the crenellated walls just ahead. This was a task that most of us, myself included, failed miserably. Time after time I found myself falling to the courtyard below, and trudging once again past the waterfall and up the stairs. Eventually those who were unable to achieve this on their own were summoned to the battlements, and we were able to venture onwards to hunt the reavers. <br><br>We encountered our first Reaver, and his reanimated breathren, and were forced to kill Lord Ghiosk. Our next Reavers were killed one by one. Along the way various members of the party were killed and rezzed, but the hunt continued. <br><br>Eventually we gathered in a corner near a ramp and we began to bring the Reavers to us, rather than do combat as they chose. We battled on, and eventually we had a chain of 13 Reavers going, maybe more. At Reaver 13 I was bashed on the head and found myself sitting out the remainder of the melee. How many came after that I have no idea, but eventually the last Reaver was slaughtered. Everyone evacuated safely, and this time we managed to get one Jade Reaver out of the raid. <br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

Two groups of stalwart adventurers entered cautiously, keeping our senses tuned, hunting for the undead creatures hiding in the mist.<br><br>We made our way to the castle entrance and waited on the bridge, drawing out occupants of the castles entrance hallway, endeavoring to have them come to us, so that we might successfully engage the unholy things in battle. We warmed up our sword arms on the captains of the guard and other flitting specters, until we were ready to enter through the metal bars of the gate, into the castle its self.<br><br>We made our way sleathily down the hallways and into the rooms of the castle. At one point the way was unclear, but our guide from Chatic Balance, one Kilvari, pointed to a section of wall. Trusting as we were, we ran head long into the stone, and found ourselves teetering on the edge of a landing, with ramps of mist-like glass leading to the upper reaches of the castle. We crept carefully up the slippery slopes, pausing on another narrow landing while Kilvari headed upwards to draw out the spirits, one by one. <br><br>One of our group lost their footing and found themselves several levels below us on ground level, unable to make their way back into the fortress. A mad dash to the entrance ensured his safety, and soldiered on, heading upwards, into a large carpeted room. There we awaited the arrival of the Black Reavers, the very monster we had ventured so far to battle.<br><br>Our first BR arrived and we set upon it with all our might, swords flashing in the candlelight, daggers stabbing from behind, and spells of fire burning its flesh. Finally it went down, only to have it's magically reanimated brethren appear in its place. Again we set to, again it went down, and again a replacement appeared immediately thereafter. This went on 11, 12, more times, until finally Lord Rak`Ashiir spawned, a foe more deadly then we were prepared to take on. But more action was required, because not one of the BRs was carrying the jade reaver weapon for which we had made this journey. It was necessary to begin the cycle again, in the hopes that the epic weapon would drop the next time through.<br><br>We were able to sneak our way back to the front of the castle using various means of escape, and from there it was our intention to reenter the castle. But it was not to be. A cataclysmic event shook the world, and we found ourselves thrown out of Norrath, awaiting such time as we could reenter and continue our quest. <br><br>There were many trails and tribulations awaiting our group upon our separate returns to Norrath, but those are tales of a different sort, and will be related at another time. Meanwhile, I stand ready and willing to enter the fray once again, and venture in the city in the mist.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

The dervishes swirled by us in the snow, prompting us to put a stop to them as we waited for the start of a raid on the Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br><br>Slowly, the other members of the raiding party began to gather: Fingwe, Markolas, Kinash, Thelous and Lonlyman. We headed off to the spiked shards of the tower and immediately ran into trouble. We were scattered, unprepared, and came to woe at the hands of the tower guardians, dervishes of no great power, but uncommon aggression. We made the mistake of attempting to engage them, when we should have run for the tower, saving our skill for the undead that lived within.<br><br>Lonelyman fell, his frozen corpse left on the ice till another time. We were saddened, but gathered our witts and finally made it inside. The undead on the first floor were no match for our resolve. We recovered the crystal key from the gnoll and moved on to the library. Mischance, or rather mis-steps, caused us to leave Markolas behind and Gluweyens braved the guardians once again to see Markolas safely through the mirror. <br><br>The wraiths in the library were troublesome until we came together to engage them with combined effort. Three times, four times, we cleared the library, awaiting the arrival of the Angry Librarian from whom we seeked a key. The arrival of the librarian coincided with the arrival of additional party members, who remained isolated on the other side of the mirror. The attempt to retrieve them did not go well, and Thelous and I came to a cold end in the wastes, joining Lonlymans corpse in the ice and snow.<br><br>The other continued thru to the next floor and were fortunate to aquire the required key very quickly. But the group's cohesion had been dispersed to the winds, and after much unproductive milling around and unproductive communication, it was time to call it a day. The corpses were revivied, porters were summoned, and everyone left the frozen islands. <br><br>This was not a shinning moment for the guild, but as with all adversity, there were lessons to be learned. All of which will be put into practice the next time we take on the undead of the Frozen Shadow. </p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

This goal has led me to expend time and money on becoming a master potter, a goal which has now been accomplished.

I made a new friend hunting large zels in DSP. He advised that I should really try the Dreadlands, and so one past day, I ventured forth, through the tunnels in Firione Vie and right into a Frost Giant who just wasn't staying rooted. After a short run to the zone, I returned to find him gone, and my new friend also in the area. But his group was full, and I feared that I would long be standing, shivering in the snow storm, trying to find a group.<br><br>But luck was with me, and I received an invitation to come join a group in some ruins near NE corner of the castle. I made it there safely and proceded to spend a merry few hours killing drachnids, and wolvangs, plus some cockatrices and beasties. It was a great group, even though members came and went thru the hours, we remained cohesive and effective, and while the exp was slow, it was consistent, and finally I dinged to level 41!<br><br>After this adventure, I accompanied Thelous on yet another trip to desimate the members of the Sambata Tribe. <br><br>But the most fun was a mad dash over Norrath with Thelous and Fingwe/Nathale. We stopped at PC, at HHK, and Blackburrow. On our mad way we healed, undiseased, buffed and recruited, and managed to add some new members to our guild. What fun!<br><br>Now I have to vow to stop getting side tracked and stay on course. There are some nice events coming up, and I have 4 levels to go before I'm allowed to take part. Onward and upward! <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Jun 19 14:29:07 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

I had endeavored to get a group together to go for the Grammar Manual quest, and the resulting ice shackles. By the scheduled time it appeared all was lost, and by the rescheduled time, the possibilities didn't seem much better. But somehow, a group came together and off Fingwe, Noksukow, Misticangel and I, went.<br><br>Our original goal was to kill the rapors only (for their guts) and we easily ported into the Wakening Lands. We were headed out when a random flying monkey managed to take out Fingwe. The rest of us amused ourselves with a bit of revenge until he made it back to us.<br><br>We took our positions near the entrance to Skyshrine and started fearing and killing the tigersaurases. Our second kill managed to get himself caught high up in a tree, and when the third was killed, we took time to levitate up to the dangling corpse. Low and behold, the guts were on him! What luck. But could it be repeated? Yes. Three more and Pheermee had his guts too.<br><br>We relocated to the caves with the flying monkeys, staying safely outside. I was thankful for the high AC gear given to me by my friend Landa (who ought to have been on the quest as well but the delays did her in, schedule-wise). Those nasty, unnatural things tossed fire, magic and elemental pets at us, but we taught them who was boss. And our luck held. Second kill and I had the strong stick. Then our luck ended. Many kills and some hours later, another stick had yet to drop, and Noksukow decided he would rather return another day.<br><br>The hardest part was done! We got a port from Fingwe's other self and headed to Iceclad for the completion of the quest and added Ayako to our group. After all the rumors about the difficulty of killing the walrus without also killing the fisherman, the end task was remarkably simple, and over in no time.<br><br>I am now the proud owner of a pair of (kinky hand cuffy looking) Ice Shackles. Now all I have to do is take the new gear into action!<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Jun 19 14:30:49 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

But at last the trends began to change, or rather, not change so much as converge. <br><br>I returned to DSP after a long abscence to assist Thelous in his tedious quest for a sky jewel. While he didn't need the assist to kill fungi shrooms, he was getting bored and I offered to keep him company.

It puts a proc on your weapon, and casts a Concussion of Air spell while you're whacking away.

The main drawback was that we never found the primalist we were hunting for (we were looking in the wrong place as it turns out) but we did kill the tribal leader and spawned the rock hoppers.<br><br>The main good thing!

I had an appointment with Kinash and made my way to Hollowshade where we met. We snuck, invisible, past the Grimlings in their forest, and found ourselves in Teneborous. Never venturing far from the caves, we hunted until it was time to gather for the days guild adventure.<br><br>We were on our way to the guild gathering place when the world crashed around us, and it was some time ere the heralds proclaimed it possible to venture out into Norrath once again.<br><br>We were gathering for a raid on Mistmoore Castle, to rid that dwelling of its undead plaque. We were heading out when an ill wind blew across my path. I ventured too close to the home of the Tier'Dal and soon I was lying, dead on the grass, with the days hunt not yet begun. Woe and alas!<br><br>The ill wind continued to blow my way, when I was unable to retrieve all my belongings from my dead self, forced to exist on two planes, that of the healthy and hale, and that of the dead. A disconcerting experience to be sure.<br><br>We entered into the lands surrounding the castle, and battled our way to the courtyard in front of the main gates. And the ill wind blew once again. A door blew open in that self same wind, and a host of the undead poured forth, and we were soon dead amongst them. But not all were slain, enough survived to call for help, which was rendered, and soon we were up and ready to battle ever onwards.<br><br>We cleared the entrance way and the hallway of the castle and passed within. We fought our way into the ballroom, bent on the task before us. The ill wind had passed, and we battled as one, and effectively. The undead were made truely dead by the edge of our swords. We headed out, having secured our small goals for the hunt. But opportunity arose, the Advisor had entered the castle, and we determined that he must be slain. We battled back to the ballroom, and there we engaged the Advisor, and emerged victorious.<br><br>The hunt was over, and with magical aide, we were transported to a safe place to mull over the days exploits and split the loot we had acquired.<br><br>This was my first guild raid. A learning experience it was indeed. But I now feel ready venture on such a quest once again.<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

With that in mind, I crafted the bracers but had yet to gather the runes necessary for the remaining pieces. Hence I'm currently clothed in a mixture of Ry-gorr, Trueshot and Ivy armor pieces.<br><br>While hunting in RM with fellow guildies, we happened upon an rogish and unkept looking Ranger who was determined to confront us. While I dislike fighting my own, he eventually died at our hands and he yielded to us a piece of a broken bow. Others in the party believed this to be something of interest to rangers, and so I came in possession of Bow Part A. <br><br>After some research, I learned this was part of the Ivy Guantlet quest, and I was now determined to find the second half of that bow and return both pieces to Leaf in Kithacor. I stated my intent to head for Guk to the guild, and was offered assistance, and company, by Adrielle. And so we found ourselves wading in swamps, winding through passageways and sneaking past frogloks in Upper Guk. Adrielle knew her way and we dropped, crept and swam our way from the dead side of Lower Guk to the Live side. <br><br>This was not without some difficulty since my swimming skills leave much to be desired, and the inhabitants were not happy to see us there. But with C3s cast upon us, and help of a necro spectre, we arrived at our goal, a room filled with minators, and Slaythe the Slayer standing right there in their midst. A battle ensued and at its end I was in possession of a Bow Part B.<br><br>Now we had to find our way out of the maze and we meandered with purpose, killing and looting along the way. How this quest can be considered a L30s to 40s endeaver is beyond me. Without the company of Adrielle, I would surely have been lost many times over. As it was, I believe I managed to hold my own in the battles, somehow got experience, and even managed to find the proper path after we had lost our way. Eventually we emerged back into the swamp gases of Innouthe and my one, and ONLY, visit to the maze they call Guk, was over.<br><br>My thanks to the lovely Adrielle for keeping me alive and whole. And those guantlets look pretty nice on me too!<br><br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Mar 17 17:13:58 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

After being throughly lost in our travels from Toxxulia, to the Warrens, to Stonebrunt and finally to the lighthouse, we arrived on a beach covered with ship wrecks and the zombie sailors. It was a desolate scene but we wandered carefully through it, picking our spots, and picking off the zombies and skellies one by one.<br><br>During a lull in the action I explored the island and found it's inhabits to be witless and scared. I don't think I want to know what made them that way. Anyone know why they are all staring at the ground? I spent some time fishing for sea urchins at the base of the cliffs and then hooked up with Kinash again and headed back for the beach.<br><br>This time we miscalculated and got two mobs at once. And it was all over. I tried to run away, I tried to swim away. That last was a bad idea of course, and I was pursued into the waters of the gulf. I tried to head back to the beach and towards the cliffs and made it a bit closer to shore before the inevitable occured. My corpse lay in Davy Jones locker and I had no idea how I was going to get it out. Kinash of course lay dead as well, but at least he was on dry land.<br><br>We were given assistance by Arculees and Carodas, without whom I would have likely remained submerged for days. One possibility for retrieval I hadn't considered was walking on the bottom (using Enduring Breath) to find my corpse, but in the end, and after many attempts to safely revive Kinash, all was well.<br><br>The moral of the story, remember to take it like a man and die on terra firma, not in the drink; that guildmates are an invaluable resource and wonderful friends; and that those sea urchins make a great miraculous meal!<br><br>And finally, I dinged to 39, and managed to keep the level too!

Those MOBs will always go after the guy that whacks on them the most, and I've determined that it will no longer be me. The bow is of course one way to accomplish this.

I killed a few bears here and there, trying not too poach on the newbies. To make things more even, I used only my fist and my bow, hoping to at least up my skill in these areas. I don't think I made much progress with the Hand-to-hand, but my archery went up to 81, a definate improvement.<br><br>I banked all the collected items for the time when I actually get my fletching skill high enough to successfully make the longbow.<br><br>I then decided to work on my faction in Shadowhaven. I finally felt confident enough to attempt the Amulet of Haven quest. Meaning I was ready to try the run thru Echo Caverns to Fungus Grove. I don't why I was so worried about those moving plants. They were very avoidable, and the guards or whatever they were, left me completely alone. Now that I have the amulet, the merchants actually will deal with me (some will never like elves, no matter what) and the prices are better.<br><br>It was now time to focus on getting to level 37. I spent time in a few different groups in DSP hunting the tribals. I finally managed to actually get play time with Drakkcoon, the alt of an old and dear friend. I fouond that Thelous's wife had a new toon and had a small conversation with her. I made a bit of money, and yes, I dinged to 37. And yes, of course, I was killed shortly thereafter and promtly lost the new level. I was able to re-ding just before I had to log. <br><br>When I logged back on later that day, I partnered with a Druid to help him get acrylia bricks. We did very well in fact, but of course we did get in trouble finally and zoned into GE. Big mistake. Some sort of oracle promptly killed Nobi, and I managed to zone just in time. <br><br>Adielle (hope I got that right) was nice enough to come to help with the corpse retrieval. Since she was level 57, and the mob was dark blue to her, I was very glad to have her assistance and remain in debt to her. Thanks again.<br><br>That's it for now. Further adventures to follow</p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

It was fun, but I ended up not giving away any of my hand-crafted bows. Guess no one wanted to hunt bats. The rest of the weekend I was constrained by playtime in one or two hour chunks, not enough time to join my friends on their various endeavors.<br><br>So I decided I was going to complete the Trueshot Longbow quest. While I am currently using a Trueshot bow, it was given to me under the condition that I complete the quest and pass on the results, same as was done for me. Reasonable request. So I set off by boat (a very slow way to travel after all the PoK book traveling) and got some kiola nuts, bought lanterns, got the dwarven wire and some micro servers. I then tried to make the bow and failed. The proper result for someone who was too cocky and had only enough supplies for one attempt.<br><br>This of course means that I now have to repeat the whole process. More lanterns, and now I await the slow boat to the Kiola Nut islands. <br><br>I did get some experience from all this when I had Trumpy make me his tonics (and the like), but I'm going to get 2 stacks of everything this time round, and I'm going to get my fletching skill up further than it's current 151.<br><br>Wish me luck and patience. And why don't the PTB let people fish on the boats? That's my question.<br><br>Donilla Deverry<br></p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

Very slowly as it turns out. A whole day of bad groupings in DSP gained me nothing but death (over and over - bah). <br><br>I then spent three days in PoK. In the night I practiced my Firefly spell. When medding and in the daytime, I brewed up endless glasses of Fetid Essence. But along with my sore thumb, I now had my conjuring skill up past 133, and I became a master brewer as well.<br><br>Another hunt was spent with Thelous in the Rathe Mountains, my first visit there. We did well for a while, but were eventually overwhelmed by Hill Giants. Clericity was nice enough to rez me, but my subsequent group (Thelous logged) was not as succesful. The KSing on that hill was amazing. Very frustrating.<br><br>Then I hooked up with some friends in Crimson Fist and headed again to Jagged Pine. A wonderful place to practice pulling and panic animal by the way. There I came within an inch of Dinging, but RL called.<br><br>Then I the pleasure of rejoining with DotP. And Fingwe and I headed to the Eastern Wastes to hunt walruses and Iceclad. I learned much and yes, I dinged to L36. And enough beyond to stay a 36 the next time I die, which is inevitable.<br><br>Hunt Long and Safe<br>Donilla Deverry</p>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>
