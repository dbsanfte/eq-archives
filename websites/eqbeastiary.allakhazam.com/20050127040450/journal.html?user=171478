Half Elf Ranger.

My Mother is Human, a lady-in-waiting to a minor noblewoman. My Father is an Elven Ranger, who served the nobleman for a time. It was a time of war, and of arranged marraiges between the minor nobility. While my mother cared for her husband, she was drawn to this foreign warrior, and discretion was thrown to winds. Things could not continue of course, and when the current hostilities ceased, my Mother and Father parted, each to pursue their chosen ways of life.

The nobleman's Holding was near Elven Lands and there is much Elven blood in the Human population of the area. So my Elven features went  unremarked, and caused no gossip, when I was born 8 months after my Mother's Human husband returned from war.

When I reached adulthood, I had a chance encounter with a seeress. She saw the truth of my lineage, and the whereabouts of my Father were revealed to her, and to me. With my mother's blessing, but in secret as my true parentage must remain unrevealed, I journed many a long day to Surefall Glade. I made myself known to my father, and was accepted. It was he who instructed me in the ways of the Ranger.

And now I journey the lands of Norrath as a Ranger, like my Father.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center>

As I sat up on my pallet, I couldn't help reliving the events that contributed to my nightmare. <br><br>The ways of justice are meant to be fair. But when interpreted rigidly, by word of law only, with no sense of humanity, they are not always right. I and my companions had heard of one such case. A prisoner was being held in the cells on the Plane of Justice, and was scheduled for execution. <br><br>The planes are ruled by ancient codes of justice. These codes allow for innocence to be determined by trial by combat. We determined to enter into a trail to save the poor prisoners life. But first we needed to determine if his cause was worth our efforts, or if he truely deserved his fate. <br><br>We passed unchallenged through the upper hallways of the Plane of Justice, and after twisting and turning through numerous corridors, we came to a long hallway, with the prison cell at the far end. The Tribunal does not make any of its task easy, and we first needed to dispatch the various monsters serving as wardens to the prisoners. We eventually passed into the cell and proceeded to interrogate the prisoner. Technically, we spoke to the prisoners spirit, since his body was already being prepared for execution. We determined that our cause was just, and that justice was not being served. <br><br>We headed out and came to a sunken room, with a blue glowing portal at one end. We passed through the portal and found ourselves in a truely non-Norrathly place. We fouond ourselves on a floating floor, the sky moved above us, too swiftly for us to still be on Norrath. Around us were a series of platforms, each guarded by a member of the Tribunal. Our trail by combat would begin when we hailed the judge guarding the gateway to the execution chamber where our prisoner was being held. <br><br>As we discussed our strategy, we sharpened our weapons and prepared our minds for the test to come. We stood up, clasped hands, and climbed as a fellowship onto the platform. We indicated our willingness to engage in the trail, and we found ourselves in yet another room in this alternate reality. Our poor prisoner was already there, and while the Tribunal acknowledges the ancient ways, they reserve the right to determine the nature of the test. <br><br>We found ourselves beseiged by wave after wave of beasts who sought to to prevent us from stopping the Executioner as he moved slowly but single mindedly forward. We dispatched the first wave of mobs, and then the second. But the third group moved even more swiftly than the previous two, and the Executioner had picked up his pace as well. He was determined that we should not succeed in our task. <br><br>Unfortanely for us, the Executioner reached his goal, and as we were about to kill the last of the third wave, we heard that awful sound. The swoosh of the axe, the wet plunk of a head hitting the floor. It was over, we had failed. We hung our heads in sorrow, and returned to the main trial chamber. Dejected, we passed througoh another glowing blue portal and found ourselves back on the planes of Norrath. <br><br>I vow that I will return to avenge the death of this prisoner. There are always those that fall through the cracks of justice and there will be others to save. Just as soon as I can get some sleep. <br><br>I rearranged the leaves under my sleeping blanket, clutched my sword in my hand, and lay back down next to the fire.</p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

My trusty sword has been taking quite a beating lately, and it needed some attention. The last weeks have been spent on a frustrating chase thru Norrath, hunting monsters, searching for knowledge, and attempting to increase my skills. Set backs abounded, and I hoped that today would be different. <br><br>Yesterday was a combination day. With a group of new friends, I had headed off to Velk, venturing once more into the icy, slippery cavern of the Kobolds and crystal spiders. For once, I did not fall to the depths, and we made it successfully to the icepaw camp. We did well, the bards song lulled the beasts and we were able to sneak past them into the corridors beyond. But there we agreed we could go no further, we had no one capable of magical travel, and no one in the group was sure of the exact path. Our return thru the camp was not successfull, and the group found itself back at their bind points, with the corpses in a pile at the hidden entrance. Fortunately our cleric had gone LD just prior to the wipe, and popped back safe and sound. Further mishaps befell us after that, one of our party falling to the depths, and then disappearing from our senses. I hope he is well. We then snuck out using camoflage and the day was ended. <br><br>As for this day, I got ready, first paying an enchanter for some mind expansion, and then heading to PoI, hoping for a chance to group with my fellows. I became part of a small group, but it disbanded shortly after a train caused us to flee to PoT. Upon my return, I hooked up with a new friend Faremoni, with whom I had fought just the day before. And we were then joined by some of my fellow guild members and it was decided to journey to the cellars of PoJ, a place I had yet to visit. But all the camp spots were taken, and we then had the misguided notion that we could take on PoD. While I have fought there before, today was not the day for success. The first malarial I pulled had me at deaths door before I returned him to the group, and my first death occured shortly thereafter. Another death soon followed, and after a short bit of success, my third. That was enough for us. I managed to find a willing cleric who rezzed me and Reditch, but only one of the three of my corpses could be found, and so I found myself lower in experience than when I started. <br><br>The group then dispersed for a rest. A bit later, another two groups were formed and we headed to Chardok on a fact finding mission, attempting to measure the fortitude of the Royals residing there, and of those protecting them. They were not so formidable, but the caverns and chasms were, and one of our group fell to bottom of one such fisure. We took out the Bridge Keeper while we attempted to raise her, but after getting zapped with a freezing AOE that come from nowhere, we elected to port out to safetly and continue an other day. <br><br>A single group then agreed to assist me in my effort to complete the set of heads I need to aquire my Helm of the Tracker. We ported to the Wakening Lands, and using camoflague and invisibility, headed to the back entrance of Kael, hoping to find the Frost Giant Overseer. But it was not to be. We killed a few Frost Giants in frustration, but soon head back to PoK. <br><br>I next headed back to PoJ, where I found a group of adventurers willing to take on a tired but eager Ranger. This went well, and finally, after much frustration and adventuring, my experience level finally reached level 55. Woot! <br><br>This day also brought to me a collapsible fletching kit (thanks Qanini and her cousin) and a new sword, curtesy of a friend Ruassano. And so quickly then do the fortunes reverse themselves.<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

I sipped often from my water flask as I made my way to the Camp, hoping to provide some needed assistance to the Wayfarers. I had barely settled in to find employment when I was hailed, and sooner than that, I was off to the Oasis and the Takish Hiz Antiquated Place. Jumping into quicksand is something I've always been told to avoid, but here, it was the only way into the place buried under the sand, and so jump, I did. <br><br>It was dry underneath the sand too, and clearly the sands of time had buried a large building, one that we began to make our way through, one room at a time. On occasion, rocks came tumbling down from overhead, causing me to wonder about the security of our ceiling, but it seemed to hold as we battled the sand elves, vortexes and other desert withered beings trapped in this old place. <br><br>Ocassionally we came upon a tree that gave off an aura of enscorcellment. Finally we attempted to knock on one, and to our amazement, a common elf appeared, apparently he had been hiding from the evil things for a very long time. He proved an able fighter, and did as he was commanded in service of the one who had freed him. An able helper, especially for those not able to conjure their own. <br><br>Eventually we were successful in our task, and we battled on a short while longer to kill the Named living in this zone. In this we were also successfull and we headed back to the camp to receive recognition for our deeds. <br><br>THen it was time to adventure further. Some of the group remained, others were replaced, and again we ventured into the desert, this time to slaughter the sand elves in their lair. Again the wet sands closed over my face before I popped free underneath the sand of the Oasis. And again we battle our way thru the rooms, hitting the random tree to free the elf, dodging the rocks falling from above. With a wizard able to summon, I had access to a continuous supply of ranger crack, and the Arrows of Marr kept zinging from my bow, with crit hits, and double damage occuring with wonderful frequency. This is the way to fight, effectivley, leathily, and from a distance, staying safe and preserving the healers mana. Again we battled successfully, no named this time, and so we headed once again to camp. <br><br>After a small detour for renewed clarity of mind, we ventured forth a third time, this time to the Royal Observatory to gather corroded trinkets. And this time luck finally abandoned us, only perserverance allowed us to complete our task. <br><br>These walls were made of glass it seemed, since every sand elf and rock monster seemed to be aware of our every attack, rushing to defense of their embattled collegue. There were deaths more than once, and an emergency evac. And the Hollow Trees? It seems that not always do they enclose a trapped elf. Sometimes three or more angry saplings sprang forth, diverting our attention and causing us much potential harm. There was also the EQ phenominum of LinkDeath, which took all of us one by one. Each time we returned from near failure, and retraced our steps. After the third such mishap, we assumed all was done, but we preservered. We were still here, we would make our attempt to succeed. <br><br>ANd our luck changed. From then on, all the helpers were successfully routed, all monsters killed, and our lives remained intact. With only minutes to spare we acheived our task, and decided to continue on to kill the WHirling Spiritstorm. He was a paltry thing after all the trials that preceeded him. And again we returned successful to the Wayfarers Camp. <br><br>THis time though, it was time to rest up for another day of adventuring in the future. <br><br>Under the Sand of the Oasis, 25 April, year of Tunare 2004.<b>Under the Sand of the Oasis </b><br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Wed Oct 13 12:57:05 2004 by mhuygen</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

I spent the time appropriately, brewing up eggnog, baking pies and making creamy fennel sauced lion fillets. With all the cooking time, I decided to step up the challenge and begin putting together all the ingredients for the Misty Thicket Picnics. While killing the brownies were a dangerous and tedious business, I have at least 100 of each the necessary ingredients and now need only skill up sufficient to ensure some level of success while putting together the baskets. <br><br>I also used the quiet time to clear out my bank, send off the unneeded and unused items for sale in the bazaar, and cook or brew up anything lying around. What a relief, a little bit less clutter for the new year. <br><br>And then it was time to venture forth once more. While the entire land seemed to remain in vacation mode, I took the opportunity to complete the quest to upgrade the wayfarer satchel and am now in possession of a 50% giant pack. While hopping from camp to camp, I was fortunate to be invited to join a group for two adventures in LFay. The first was to collect dire wolf tufts to help rid the lower regions of this menace. All began well, but then we were accosted by two roaming undeads and the Ogre went to his death trying to save the rest of us. Then I went down trying to save the cleric and the others. In the end, only half the party died (one ran screaming for the entrance so she could rez us later), and the rest remained trapped for some time before rezz's were administered and the roamers were eliminated. In spite of this huge delay, we finished the quest with 2 minutes to spare. <br><br>Flush with this success, we elected to attempt another, this time for bone fragments. This time all proceeded without incident, and we were finished with ample time to spare. I collected my first augemntation stone, and Snegler decided that I did not possess gear sufficient to attach it to. I am now provided with a new bracer and a Nightmare Compound Bow. My old gear has been donated to the guild for the improvement of our younger members. <br><br>I also was fortunate enough to welcome a new member to our guild family, Memnoch, and he enlisted me and few other guildies in one of his favorite activities, igniting war in Hollowshade Moor. While I'm not sure how noble this was, it was quite fun to watch the owl run off the grimlings and the sonic wolves, putting an end to the migrations, and slaughtering all the named leaders in sight. My first introduction was not kind. I was camped in the tent near Shar Val when I awoke to find 10 wolves setting upon me, much to my ill health. Restored but with the wolves still in supremecy, I elected to become one with them, and when the kitty defenders ran for their lives, I was promptly slain by them as well. A poor introduction, but things got better after that. <br>Taking advantage of all the fuss also netted us some decent gear, especially for a green zone. I received my first haste item from a sonic wolf not entirely willing to give it to me, and an owl furnished me with a black feathered circlet. <br><br>My duties will likely keep me away from adventures, allowing me only a few days scattered here and there for more adventures, but I will venture forth as often as possible. <br><br>Hunt Long and Safe<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

Our goal was vampire teeth and under the able guidance of our leader, we proceeded smoothly thru the dungeon until we had collected the required number of teeth, and some extra loot to boot (hehe).

Went to the Wastes to collect Uthrok meat and snow griffen eggs. Got the pies made, but the souffle is still awaiting eggs. Spent some time in the bazaar trading. Got myself a gate potion so I won't get stuck in a lousy dungeon ever again. <br><br>But mostly it was time to learn how to lead others, something every Ranger getting close to her 50th year needs to get skilled in. My first lesson came in Grimling, under the watchful eye of Qanini. I got the groups made - we had healers and mezzers, but I was the tank, if you believe that. And I had to pull, something I've never had much success with in Grimling. They always want to help out their buddies, much to my chagrin. I managed to kill Reditch, but that was the only fatality, much thanks for that. And we managed to collect some plat for the guilds coffers as well. <br><br>The second lesson was a lesson in what not to do. After being notified that I was to lead a raid to Splitpaw, I found myself in a quandry. Having never been there, and knowing it to be a dangerous place, I was very hesitant to accept the assignement. While I was in LD hell, the decision was made to go as a group to GD instead, and I happily took charge of this small group. After a bit too much milling around and not listening, we ended up at the giant's fortress, tucked safely, we thought, on the east side of the structure. One successfull pull, and an unexpected pop later, and our safety zone was not so safe anymore. We had some deaths and lots of running to safety. My fault. I just didnt' exert enough control and know-how. I guess you learn the most by failing. <br><br>We got a much needed influx of reinforcements, and Sneglur ended up taking charge. I kept a watchfull eye on how he proceeded. He pulled from a safer location. And he coaching of the tanks was very enlightning. He got Frogyboo getting crit hit practically every other hit. I was much impressed, and hopefully, I will recall what I observed. Assuming I will be allowed to take charge in the future.<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

The hero's badge quest is still awaiting the confessions of two miscreants in South Karana. <br><br>However, true to my dual nature, I set off on a new adventure. When I ventured forth from my respite, my mind was filled with whispers of a new band of brothers, the Wayfarers. I followed the voice and traveled to Qeynos where I spoke with a brother who sent me to a wayfarers camp located in the midst of Everfrost. There I received my Adventurers Stone, and was informed of the purpose of the new brotherhood.

Groups were formed, buffs were cast, and soon a string of people were running over the hills of PoT and heading down a long, rocky tunnel to arrive at the entrace to the Ruins of Luxanvom. <br><br>I touched my fingers to the dry stone column that rose from the center of the cavern and found myself in a graveyard, surrounded by my fellow adventurers. We arranged ourselves for the battles to come: healers and finger wigglers on the side walls of the room, tanks in front, and everyone else arrayed behind.<br><br>Experienced and effective pullers lured the monsters to us, one by one, and bit by bit, we inched our way forward through the underground ruins in the Crypt of Decay. <br><br>It would not be my role this day to use my swords and fighting ability. Instead it would be my trusty Nightmare Bow that would prove useful. This was made so by the kind graces of Tearon, my guild mate, who gave me the use of his Talons Bracer. With an endless supply of magic arrows, my bow could become fearful weapon of damage in the battles we were engaged in, and use it I did.<br><br>It was our goal to kill the named personages, in the required order and we started of well. But in the midst of battling near a ramp, the deaths of some of our commrades caused a swarm of skeletons to advance upon the group, and the momentum was lost as one by one, we fell to horde. It was fortunate that some managed to escape the slaughter, and we soon returned to the graveyard to continue on. <br><br>We advanced one again. We went one mob further. And while I was once again sacrified for the good of the whole, I was this time resurrected to help continue the fight. The bursts of flame, the crunch of sword upon bone, the fighting songs of the bard all surrounded me as we advanced chamber by chamber. <br><br>And then finally we arrived at the spawn point of the High Priest Ulthor Szanvon, and there he awaited us. The room was quiet as the mages and enchanters cast their spells, attempting to lessen his defenses before we began the fight. And finally the count down began, 10,9,.... 1, GO. And the fight was on. At first there seems to be no affect. The hundreds of targeted arrows found their mark but seemed not to prick his skin. The blows of swords seemed to bounce off without doing harm. But then, slowly, the hits began to take their toll. A few valiant warriors went down in the struggle but at last the kill was ours. <br><br>And there he was, the goal of this effort, Tarkil Adan. I hailed him in my turn and was rewarded with a key to the lower crypt of CoD, and with a character flag I have yet to discover the worth of.<br><br>As for my performance, I could have done better. I reacted to an attack on my person with a DoT, forgetting that this would render the Death Knight un-mezzable when a kind mage attempted to help me. And a problem with targeting caused me to shoot an arrow at another quiet knight, causing him to leap into the fray. I will have to do better when once again I am faced with a room of so many fighters, targets and messengers. But I found the experience worthy, and hope that my next performace will be worthy as well.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Wed Oct 20 16:29:57 2004 by mhuygen</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

A flock of snow griffins, scattered all about the wastes, near where the sleeper lay. I can't recall ever seeing so many about at one time.

We began our treacherous ascent up the ramps and narrow bridges, fighting our way past spiders, guardians and the other cyrstalline monsters dwelling in this icy world. <br><br>One wrong step and I started to slide, close to the edge, and then over, falling down into the depths below. I picked myself up as the spiders swarmed over my bruised body. A drink of a gate potion and I was safe. I made my way back to the labyrinth as my companions continued their battle upwards into the kobold camp, down the well, and into the caves below. <br><br>Two of my companions, Pheermee and Miserable, awaited my return. We began our trek, taking a different route in order to reach another stranded mate. Meanwhile the main group continued to make their way through the caves below. <br><br>Our smaller band reached Arabus, and we continued upwards until we reached a dead end. We had to retrace our steps, now heading down the slippery ramps we had just finished climbing. We eventually reached a castle with crystal statue guardians, but were unable to get our gnomes up and over the ice barrier in front of the fortress. We could continue no further in this direction. <br><br>Meanwhile the main group had run into difficulty and with the skill of the magic users amongst them, were able to evacuate safely to the entrance. Our smaller party made it's back as well, and soon the companions were together again. <br><br>It was decided that we would make a second assault on Velk, and off we went. Down the icy corridors, up the slippery slopes. And once again misfortune befell me. A mis-step over a collapsed section of walkway and I found myself sprawled on a bridge one level below. An attack by a crystal spider pushed me off the bridge, and again I found myself in a pit, embattled and separated from my friends. There was no time for a drink of potion, and Sneglars valiant attempt to rescue me came too late. <br><br>There were those among us with the gift of resurrection and soon I was back with the party. They had taken the precaution of dragging my corpse up the icy ramps so I would not have to risk falling again. A wise precaution since my skill on this adventure seemed to be sorely lacking. To say that I feared every step I took, is to understate my trepidation, as we went one by one down the sliding ramps, over and down an icy ledge, and inched our way around a large cavern ledge. A pass through an invisible doorway and we were in the camp of the Kobolds, where we proceeded to slaughter it's inhabitants to clear our path to the caverns below. <br><br>With the way now clear, we crept into the caves behind the camp. I followed the group into an shimmering waterfall that feed into a stone well and found myself in an airless tube with only a waterstone to provide air for my straining lungs. We emerged into the paths and caverns below, where magical traps and frozen denizens awaited us, determined to prevent us from traveling towards our goal, the Monk in charge of this area, Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar. Soon though, we had him in our sights as we prepared to make battle. <br><br>He proved too much for our valiant group. We found ourselves variously summoned and assualted in turn, until only those among us with the ability to magically transport were beyound his terrible reach. <br><br>A skilled necromancer with a sackfull of magical coffins was able to summon our corpses from their not so comfortable resting place. Our brave party awaits another day to exact our revenge. <br><br>Donilla Deverry <br>An acount of an adventure to Velkator on this the first day of February, in the year of Tunare, 2004.<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

Ill Omen indeed, and I struggled, stirring up more mud, making the darkness even more complete. Hoping that both my invisiblity spell and my enduring breathe spell would hold, I carefully swam behind numerous bloodgills and other denizens of the deep, until finally, there is was, a stairway, covered with seaweed, appearing out of the gloom. <br><br>I swam thru, and seeing a glimer of light, headed up to find myself in a big ruined space, with a waterfall caused by a breech in the ceiling. And yet, that space remained filled with air, a miracle I had hoped for, but dared not count on. <br><br>I was met by Gluweyens and Miserable, and we navigated the corridors invisible as ghosts until we arrived at the spot they had staked out for their hunting. The orignal inhabitants of this sunken place would never have imagined the creatures that now wandered thru their city. We hunted these creatures with some success, but this was the provence of the undead now, and eventually, their ability to sap life from any living creature would bring me to much harm, and death. <br><br>But as always in this land, death is never final, and I was not doomed to wander the depths as another of the undead. After restoring my life, we snuck down hallways and passages filled with the undead, and then with the living, and made our way once again thru the murky depths of the Lake. I was very happy to step onto the sands of the beach, and thankful to come out alive after the end of yet another new adventure. <br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

My friend Peano, and his mates from Crimson Fist needed assistance, and I answered the call, knowing that death and destuction were likley to be my only reward. <br><br>We were heading into the lair of Lady Vox, with 18 steadfast and fearless adventurers. We gathered at the staging area, ensuring that all the local frost giants were no longer impeeding our progress. We headed in and up the ramps, and instantly, misfortune hit us. Some fell into the traps set to catch the unwary. Many, many other fell victim to the dragon herself when she inexplicably ventured out from her lair, accompanied by frost giant bodyguards. It was a slaughter, and recovering from the catastrophe took quite awhile, so long that 6 of our party were no longer able to continue. A vote was taken, and in our insanity, we elected to make another attempt at the Lady. <br><br>We engaged the dragon full force, but her ability to fear caught many of us, sending us running in terror thru icy hallways, past blocks of ice containing other unfortunate advertures. We could only hope that we would not meet such a fate. We kept returning, and running in terror, and returning, until the last, when Lady Vox called in reinforcements, and we were overrun by bears and spiders. This spelled our doom. After this recovery we felt we could do no more, and thankful for our reserrected lives, we slinked out of the castle, leaving the Lady Vox alive in her lair. <br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

I learned from talking to the inhabitants that these creations were in fact portals to the lands of the Gods and the elements, and that I must earn my right to travel in those domains. <br><br>A few of these &quot;planes&quot; however, were open to me, and I journeyed to an area where justice and law was said to rule all. I entered a graveyard, filled with corpses and devices of toture. It would seem that justice here was both swift and terrible. But was it just? This was something I would have to determine for myself, and I soon came to the conclusion that something was amiss in this land of law, and it was necessary to us heros in training to expend a bit of righteousness of our own.<br><br>I will be returning here when I can, and hopefully, with the help of my fellow Norrathians, we will be able to restore to justice it's true meaning. <br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

It was agreed we would forge on and after getting everyone together, we headed in through the iron gates into the castle. We ventured through the hallways, and carefully walked up the crystal ramps, killing the undead things along the way. Our was was now barred as we could not open the door to continue, so it was necessary to take an alternate route.<br><br>We came at last to the upper ramparts of the castle and it was now time to test our jumping skills. The first jump was to the top of the flag/banner, the second to the crenellated walls just ahead. This was a task that most of us, myself included, failed miserably. Time after time I found myself falling to the courtyard below, and trudging once again past the waterfall and up the stairs. Eventually those who were unable to achieve this on their own were summoned to the battlements, and we were able to venture onwards to hunt the reavers. <br><br>We encountered our first Reaver, and his reanimated breathren, and were forced to kill Lord Ghiosk. Our next Reavers were killed one by one. Along the way various members of the party were killed and rezzed, but the hunt continued. <br><br>Eventually we gathered in a corner near a ramp and we began to bring the Reavers to us, rather than do combat as they chose. We battled on, and eventually we had a chain of 13 Reavers going, maybe more. At Reaver 13 I was bashed on the head and found myself sitting out the remainder of the melee. How many came after that I have no idea, but eventually the last Reaver was slaughtered. Everyone evacuated safely, and this time we managed to get one Jade Reaver out of the raid. <br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

Two groups of stalwart adventurers entered cautiously, keeping our senses tuned, hunting for the undead creatures hiding in the mist.<br><br>We made our way to the castle entrance and waited on the bridge, drawing out occupants of the castles entrance hallway, endeavoring to have them come to us, so that we might successfully engage the unholy things in battle. We warmed up our sword arms on the captains of the guard and other flitting specters, until we were ready to enter through the metal bars of the gate, into the castle its self.<br><br>We made our way sleathily down the hallways and into the rooms of the castle. At one point the way was unclear, but our guide from Chatic Balance, one Kilvari, pointed to a section of wall. Trusting as we were, we ran head long into the stone, and found ourselves teetering on the edge of a landing, with ramps of mist-like glass leading to the upper reaches of the castle. We crept carefully up the slippery slopes, pausing on another narrow landing while Kilvari headed upwards to draw out the spirits, one by one. <br><br>One of our group lost their footing and found themselves several levels below us on ground level, unable to make their way back into the fortress. A mad dash to the entrance ensured his safety, and soldiered on, heading upwards, into a large carpeted room. There we awaited the arrival of the Black Reavers, the very monster we had ventured so far to battle.<br><br>Our first BR arrived and we set upon it with all our might, swords flashing in the candlelight, daggers stabbing from behind, and spells of fire burning its flesh. Finally it went down, only to have it's magically reanimated brethren appear in its place. Again we set to, again it went down, and again a replacement appeared immediately thereafter. This went on 11, 12, more times, until finally Lord Rak`Ashiir spawned, a foe more deadly then we were prepared to take on. But more action was required, because not one of the BRs was carrying the jade reaver weapon for which we had made this journey. It was necessary to begin the cycle again, in the hopes that the epic weapon would drop the next time through.<br><br>We were able to sneak our way back to the front of the castle using various means of escape, and from there it was our intention to reenter the castle. But it was not to be. A cataclysmic event shook the world, and we found ourselves thrown out of Norrath, awaiting such time as we could reenter and continue our quest. <br><br>There were many trails and tribulations awaiting our group upon our separate returns to Norrath, but those are tales of a different sort, and will be related at another time. Meanwhile, I stand ready and willing to enter the fray once again, and venture in the city in the mist.<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

The dervishes swirled by us in the snow, prompting us to put a stop to them as we waited for the start of a raid on the Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br><br>Slowly, the other members of the raiding party began to gather: Fingwe, Markolas, Kinash, Thelous and Lonlyman. We headed off to the spiked shards of the tower and immediately ran into trouble. We were scattered, unprepared, and came to woe at the hands of the tower guardians, dervishes of no great power, but uncommon aggression. We made the mistake of attempting to engage them, when we should have run for the tower, saving our skill for the undead that lived within.<br><br>Lonelyman fell, his frozen corpse left on the ice till another time. We were saddened, but gathered our witts and finally made it inside. The undead on the first floor were no match for our resolve. We recovered the crystal key from the gnoll and moved on to the library. Mischance, or rather mis-steps, caused us to leave Markolas behind and Gluweyens braved the guardians once again to see Markolas safely through the mirror. <br><br>The wraiths in the library were troublesome until we came together to engage them with combined effort. Three times, four times, we cleared the library, awaiting the arrival of the Angry Librarian from whom we seeked a key. The arrival of the librarian coincided with the arrival of additional party members, who remained isolated on the other side of the mirror. The attempt to retrieve them did not go well, and Thelous and I came to a cold end in the wastes, joining Lonlymans corpse in the ice and snow.<br><br>The other continued thru to the next floor and were fortunate to aquire the required key very quickly. But the group's cohesion had been dispersed to the winds, and after much unproductive milling around and unproductive communication, it was time to call it a day. The corpses were revivied, porters were summoned, and everyone left the frozen islands. <br><br>This was not a shinning moment for the guild, but as with all adversity, there were lessons to be learned. All of which will be put into practice the next time we take on the undead of the Frozen Shadow. </p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

This goal has led me to expend time and money on becoming a master potter, a goal which has now been accomplished.

I made a new friend hunting large zels in DSP. He advised that I should really try the Dreadlands, and so one past day, I ventured forth, through the tunnels in Firione Vie and right into a Frost Giant who just wasn't staying rooted. After a short run to the zone, I returned to find him gone, and my new friend also in the area. But his group was full, and I feared that I would long be standing, shivering in the snow storm, trying to find a group.<br><br>But luck was with me, and I received an invitation to come join a group in some ruins near NE corner of the castle. I made it there safely and proceded to spend a merry few hours killing drachnids, and wolvangs, plus some cockatrices and beasties. It was a great group, even though members came and went thru the hours, we remained cohesive and effective, and while the exp was slow, it was consistent, and finally I dinged to level 41!<br><br>After this adventure, I accompanied Thelous on yet another trip to desimate the members of the Sambata Tribe. <br><br>But the most fun was a mad dash over Norrath with Thelous and Fingwe/Nathale. We stopped at PC, at HHK, and Blackburrow. On our mad way we healed, undiseased, buffed and recruited, and managed to add some new members to our guild. What fun!<br><br>Now I have to vow to stop getting side tracked and stay on course. There are some nice events coming up, and I have 4 levels to go before I'm allowed to take part.

I had endeavored to get a group together to go for the Grammar Manual quest, and the resulting ice shackles. By the scheduled time it appeared all was lost, and by the rescheduled time, the possibilities didn't seem much better. But somehow, a group came together and off Fingwe, Noksukow, Misticangel and I, went.<br><br>Our original goal was to kill the rapors only (for their guts) and we easily ported into the Wakening Lands. We were headed out when a random flying monkey managed to take out Fingwe. The rest of us amused ourselves with a bit of revenge until he made it back to us.<br><br>We took our positions near the entrance to Skyshrine and started fearing and killing the tigersaurases. Our second kill managed to get himself caught high up in a tree, and when the third was killed, we took time to levitate up to the dangling corpse. Low and behold, the guts were on him! What luck. But could it be repeated? Yes. Three more and Pheermee had his guts too.<br><br>We relocated to the caves with the flying monkeys, staying safely outside. I was thankful for the high AC gear given to me by my friend Landa (who ought to have been on the quest as well but the delays did her in, schedule-wise). Those nasty, unnatural things tossed fire, magic and elemental pets at us, but we taught them who was boss. And our luck held. Second kill and I had the strong stick. Then our luck ended. Many kills and some hours later, another stick had yet to drop, and Noksukow decided he would rather return another day.<br><br>The hardest part was done! We got a port from Fingwe's other self and headed to Iceclad for the completion of the quest and added Ayako to our group. After all the rumors about the difficulty of killing the walrus without also killing the fisherman, the end task was remarkably simple, and over in no time.<br><br>I am now the proud owner of a pair of (kinky hand cuffy looking) Ice Shackles. Now all I have to do is take the new gear into action!<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Jun 19 14:30:49 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

I had an appointment with Kinash and made my way to Hollowshade where we met. We snuck, invisible, past the Grimlings in their forest, and found ourselves in Teneborous. Never venturing far from the caves, we hunted until it was time to gather for the days guild adventure.<br><br>We were on our way to the guild gathering place when the world crashed around us, and it was some time ere the heralds proclaimed it possible to venture out into Norrath once again.<br><br>We were gathering for a raid on Mistmoore Castle, to rid that dwelling of its undead plaque. We were heading out when an ill wind blew across my path. I ventured too close to the home of the Tier'Dal and soon I was lying, dead on the grass, with the days hunt not yet begun. Woe and alas!<br><br>The ill wind continued to blow my way, when I was unable to retrieve all my belongings from my dead self, forced to exist on two planes, that of the healthy and hale, and that of the dead. A disconcerting experience to be sure.<br><br>We entered into the lands surrounding the castle, and battled our way to the courtyard in front of the main gates. And the ill wind blew once again. A door blew open in that self same wind, and a host of the undead poured forth, and we were soon dead amongst them. But not all were slain, enough survived to call for help, which was rendered, and soon we were up and ready to battle ever onwards.<br><br>We cleared the entrance way and the hallway of the castle and passed within. We fought our way into the ballroom, bent on the task before us. The ill wind had passed, and we battled as one, and effectively. The undead were made truely dead by the edge of our swords. We headed out, having secured our small goals for the hunt. But opportunity arose, the Advisor had entered the castle, and we determined that he must be slain. We battled back to the ballroom, and there we engaged the Advisor, and emerged victorious.<br><br>The hunt was over, and with magical aide, we were transported to a safe place to mull over the days exploits and split the loot we had acquired.<br><br>This was my first guild raid. A learning experience it was indeed.

While I dislike fighting my own, he eventually died at our hands and he yielded to us a piece of a broken bow. Others in the party believed this to be something of interest to rangers, and so I came in possession of Bow Part A. <br><br>After some research, I learned this was part of the Ivy Guantlet quest, and I was now determined to find the second half of that bow and return both pieces to Leaf in Kithacor. I stated my intent to head for Guk to the guild, and was offered assistance, and company, by Adrielle. And so we found ourselves wading in swamps, winding through passageways and sneaking past frogloks in Upper Guk. Adrielle knew her way and we dropped, crept and swam our way from the dead side of Lower Guk to the Live side. <br><br>This was not without some difficulty since my swimming skills leave much to be desired, and the inhabitants were not happy to see us there. But with C3s cast upon us, and help of a necro spectre, we arrived at our goal, a room filled with minators, and Slaythe the Slayer standing right there in their midst. A battle ensued and at its end I was in possession of a Bow Part B.<br><br>Now we had to find our way out of the maze and we meandered with purpose, killing and looting along the way. How this quest can be considered a L30s to 40s endeaver is beyond me. Without the company of Adrielle, I would surely have been lost many times over. As it was, I believe I managed to hold my own in the battles, somehow got experience, and even managed to find the proper path after we had lost our way. Eventually we emerged back into the swamp gases of Innouthe and my one, and ONLY, visit to the maze they call Guk, was over.<br><br>My thanks to the lovely Adrielle for keeping me alive and whole. And those guantlets look pretty nice on me too!<br><br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Mar 17 17:13:58 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>
