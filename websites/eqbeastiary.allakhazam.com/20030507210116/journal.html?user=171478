Half Elf Ranger.

My Mother is Human, a lady-in-waiting to a minor noblewoman. My Father is an Elven Ranger, who served the nobleman for a time. It was a time of war, and of arranged marraiges between the minor nobility. While my mother cared for her husband, she was drawn to this foreign warrior, and discretion was thrown to winds. Things could not continue of course, and when the current hostilities ceased, my Mother and Father parted, each to pursue their chosen ways of life.

The nobleman's Holding was near Elven Lands and there is much Elven blood in the Human population of the area. So my Elven features went  unremarked, and caused no gossip, when I was born 8 months after my Mother's Human husband returned from war.

When I reached adulthood, I had a chance encounter with a seeress. She saw the truth of my lineage, and the whereabouts of my Father were revealed to her, and to me. With my mother's blessing, but in secret as my true parentage must remain unrevealed, I journed many a long day to Surefall Glade. I made myself known to my father, and was accepted. It was he who instructed me in the ways of the Ranger.

And now I journey the lands of Norrath as a Ranger, like my Father.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The path to success is not always smooth, and this day certainly proved the point. I had endeavored to get a group together to go for the Grammar Manual quest, and the resulting Ice Forged Shackles. By the scheduled time it appeared all was lost, and by the rescheduled time, the possibilities didn't seem much better. But somehow, a group came together and off Fingwe, Noksukow, Misticangel and I, went.<br><br>Our original goal was to kill the rapors only (for their guts) and we easily ported into the Wakening Lands. We were headed out when a random flying monkey managed to take out Fingwe. The rest of us amused ourselves with a bit of revenge until he made it back to us.<br><br>We took our positions near the entrance to Skyshrine and started fearing and killing the tigersaurases. Our second kill managed to get himself caught high up in a tree, and after the third was killed, we took time to levitate up to the dangling corpse. Low and behold, the guts were on him! What luck! But could it be repeated? Yes. Three more and Noksukow had his guts too.<br><br>We relocated to the caves with the flying monkeys, staying safely outside. Those nasty, unnatural things tossed fire, magic and elemental pets at us, but we taught them who was boss. And our luck held. Second kill and I had the strong stick. Then our luck ended. Many kills and some hours later, another stick had yet to drop, and Noksukow decided he would rather return another day.<br><br>The hardest part was done! We got a port from Fingwe's other self and headed to Iceclad for the completion of the quest. We picked up Ayako along the way. After all the rumors about the difficulty of killing the walrus without also killing the fisherman, the end task was remarkably simple, and over in no time.<br><br>I am now the proud owner of a pair of (kinky hand cuff y looking) Ice Forged Shackles. Now all I have to do is take the new gear into action!<br><br>Donilla Deverry<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Apr&nbsp;&nbsp;8 17:09:20 2003</em><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've been on the underside of 40 for some time now, and while I enjoy being young, it was becoming time to move onward and upward. <br><br>However I found myself continuously distracted by other events and friends, not such a bad thing. But at last the trends began to change, or rather, not change so much as converge. <br><br>I returned to DSP after a long abscence to assist Thelous in his tedious quest for a sky jewel. While he didn't need the assist to kill fungi shrooms, he was getting bored and I offered to keep him company. During this time I finally discovered the purpose of the CalloftheSky spell I had spent so much money on. It puts a proc on your weapon, and casts a Concussion of Air spell while you're whacking away. A nice effect, and a welcome bit of assistance! <br><br>After some fruitless time rooting empty mushrooms, we decided the best approach was to go for the tribal primalist and another loot item he needed, a mark of something or other. <br><br>This turned out to be a fun thing because eventually we had two groups together, in a raid format, heading into the tribal caves, killing gathers, hunters and advisors with skill and syncronicity. The main drawback was that we never found the primalist we were hunting for (we were looking in the wrong place as it turns out) but we did kill the tribal leader and spawned the rock hoppers.<br><br>The main good thing! I dinged to level 40! <br><br>Thanks Thelous&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Donilla Deverry<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Apr  7 19:21:03 2003</em><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The sun was high in the sky when I ventured out for the days journeys. I had an appointment with Kinash and made my way to Hollowshade where we met. We snuck, invisible, past the Grimlings in their forest, and found ourselves in Teneborous. Never venturing far from the caves, we hunted until it was time to gather for the days guild adventure.<br><br>We were on our way to the guild gathering place when the world crashed around us, and it was some time ere the heralds proclaimed it possible to venture out into Norrath once again.<br><br>We were gathering for a raid on Mistmoore Castle, to rid that dwelling of its undead plaque. We were heading out when an ill wind blew across my path. I ventured too close to the home of the Tier'Dal and soon I was lying, dead on the grass, with the days hunt not yet begun. Woe and alas!<br><br>The ill wind continued to blow my way, when I was unable to retrieve all my belongings from my dead self, forced to exist on two planes, that of the healthy and hale, and that of the dead. A disconcerting experience to be sure.<br><br>We entered into the lands surrounding the castle, and battled our way to the courtyard in front of the main gates. And the ill wind blew once again. A door blew open in that self same wind, and a host of the undead poured forth, and we were soon dead amongst them. But not all were slain, enough survived to call for help, which was rendered, and soon we were up and ready to battle ever onwards.<br><br>We cleared the entrance way and the hallway of the castle and passed within. We fought our way into the ballroom, bent on the task before us. The ill wind had passed, and we battled as one, and effectively. The undead were made truely dead by the edge of our swords. We headed out, having secured our small goals for the hunt. But opportunity arose, the Advisor had entered the castle, and we determined that he must be slain. We battled back to the ballroom, and there we engaged the Advisor, and emerged victorious.<br><br>The hunt was over, and with magical aide, we were transported to a safe place to mull over the days exploits and split the loot we had acquired.<br><br>This was my first guild raid. A learning experience it was indeed. But I now feel ready venture on such a quest once again.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Some while back I was gifted Ivy Etched Armor pieces by a friend, with the idea that when able, I would craft my own set and hand it down as it was handed down to me. With that in mind, I crafted the bracers but had yet to gather the runes necessary for the remaining pieces. Hence I'm currently clothed in a mixture of Ry-gorr, Trueshot and Ivy armor pieces.<br><br>While hunting in RM with fellow guildies, we happened upon an rogish and unkept looking Ranger who was determined to confront us. While I dislike fighting my own, he eventually died at our hands and he yielded to us a piece of a broken bow. Others in the party believed this to be something of interest to rangers, and so I came in possession of Bow Part A. <br><br>After some research, I learned this was part of the Ivy Guantlet quest, and I was now determined to find the second half of that bow and return both pieces to Leaf in Kithacor. I stated my intent to head for Guk to the guild, and was offered assistance, and company, by Adrielle. And so we found ourselves wading in swamps, winding through passageways and sneaking past frogloks in Upper Guk. Adrielle knew her way and we dropped, crept and swam our way from the dead side of Lower Guk to the Live side. <br><br>This was not without some difficulty since my swimming skills leave much to be desired, and the inhabitants were not happy to see us there. But with C3s cast upon us, and help of a necro spectre, we arrived at our goal, a room filled with minators, and Slaythe the Slayer standing right there in their midst. A battle ensued and at its end I was in possession of a Bow Part B.<br><br>Now we had to find our way out of the maze and we meandered with purpose, killing and looting along the way. How this quest can be considered a L30s to 40s endeaver is beyond me. Without the company of Adrielle, I would surely have been lost many times over. As it was, I believe I managed to hold my own in the battles, somehow got experience, and even managed to find the proper path after we had lost our way. Eventually we emerged back into the swamp gases of Innouthe and my one, and ONLY, visit to the maze they call Guk, was over.<br><br>My thanks to the lovely Adrielle for keeping me alive and whole. And those guantlets look pretty nice on me too!<br><br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Mar 17 17:13:58 2003</em><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I traveled with Kinash on this day, heading for Gunthak and new hunting grounds. After being throughly lost in our travels from Toxxulia, to the Warrens, to Stonebrunt and finally to the lighthouse, we arrived on a beach covered with ship wrecks and the zombie sailors. It was a desolate scene but we wandered carefully through it, picking our spots, and picking off the zombies and skellies one by one.<br><br>During a lull in the action I explored the island and found it's inhabits to be witless and scared. I don't think I want to know what made them that way. Anyone know why they are all staring at the ground? I spent some time fishing for sea urchins at the base of the cliffs and then hooked up with Kinash again and headed back for the beach.<br><br>This time we miscalculated and got two mobs at once. And it was all over. I tried to run away, I tried to swim away. That last was a bad idea of course, and I was pursued into the waters of the gulf. I tried to head back to the beach and towards the cliffs and made it a bit closer to shore before the inevitable occured. My corpse lay in Davy Jones locker and I had no idea how I was going to get it out. Kinash of course lay dead as well, but at least he was on dry land.<br><br>We were given assistance by Arculees and Carodas, without whom I would have likely remained submerged for days. One possibility for retrieval I hadn't considered was walking on the bottom (using Enduring Breath) to find my corpse, but in the end, and after many attempts to safely revive Kinash, all was well.<br><br>The moral of the story, remember to take it like a man and die on terra firma, not in the drink; that guildmates are an invaluable resource and wonderful friends; and that those sea urchins make a great miraculous meal!<br><br>And finally, I dinged to 39, and managed to keep the level too! Now I can levitate myself! Might have helped!<br><br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

It was a very genial and productive grouping.<br><br>As a result, I finally got my bank account higher than it's usual 165pp. I'm over 1200pp plat, and that includes buying a much needed rallic pack from Chayde. <br><br>I also got a good chance to work on my archery skill.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It was time to take stock in my skills, and in so doing, I found myself seriously lacking in all weapon skills other than 1H slash. It was time to remedy that situation. As a non-tank, a rangers greatest challenge is to spell and melee without draining the healer of his mana, and without getting herself killed from getting all the aggros.<br><br>One way to avoid this would seem to be by using a slower, but larger damage weapon. Those MOBs will always go after the guy that whacks on them the most, and I've determined that it will no longer be me. The bow is of course one way to accomplish this. But it is not a sure thing that the others in your group won't hate you for it. So another solution was required. Perhaps......2H slash?<br><br>I acquired a decent, but not ubber, BABS and set to work fear kiting zels in DSP. It was slow, tedious and involved lots, lots, lots, lots and lots of running doing alot of butt kicking (literally...hehe). But I managed to get the skill up to 21 from 0. better, but not great. With archery now in the mid-80s, I might actually have a chance at becoming a well rounded ranger! <br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>Donilla Deverry<br>Still 37th Ranger of Tunare <br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Since I started, I spent some more time on the Trueshot Longbow quest.<br><br>I spent as much time killing spiderlings in Everfrost as I care to for a long while. I killed a few bears here and there, trying not too poach on the newbies. To make things more even, I used only my fist and my bow, hoping to at least up my skill in these areas. I don't think I made much progress with the Hand-to-hand, but my archery went up to 81, a definate improvement.<br><br>I banked all the collected items for the time when I actually get my fletching skill high enough to successfully make the longbow.<br><br>I then decided to work on my faction in Shadowhaven. I finally felt confident enough to attempt the Amulet of Haven quest. Meaning I was ready to try the run thru Echo Caverns to Fungus Grove. I don't why I was so worried about those moving plants. They were very avoidable, and the guards or whatever they were, left me completely alone. Now that I have the amulet, the merchants actually will deal with me (some will never like elves, no matter what) and the prices are better.<br><br>It was now time to focus on getting to level 37. I spent time in a few different groups in DSP hunting the tribals. I finally managed to actually get play time with Drakkcoon, the alt of an old and dear friend. I fouond that Thelous's wife had a new toon and had a small conversation with her. I made a bit of money, and yes, I dinged to 37. And yes, of course, I was killed shortly thereafter and promtly lost the new level. I was able to re-ding just before I had to log. <br><br>When I logged back on later that day, I partnered with a Druid to help him get acrylia bricks. We did very well in fact, but of course we did get in trouble finally and zoned into GE. Big mistake. Some sort of oracle promptly killed Nobi, and I managed to zone just in time. <br><br>Adielle (hope I got that right) was nice enough to come to help with the corpse retrieval.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Instead of gaining experience this past weekend, I participated in the Newbie Fest held by DotP. It was fun, but I ended up not giving away any of my hand-crafted bows. Guess no one wanted to hunt bats. The rest of the weekend I was constrained by playtime in one or two hour chunks, not enough time to join my friends on their various endeavors.<br><br>So I decided I was going to complete the Trueshot Longbow quest. While I am currently using a Trueshot bow, it was given to me under the condition that I complete the quest and pass on the results, same as was done for me. Reasonable request. So I set off by boat (a very slow way to travel after all the PoK book traveling) and got some kiola nuts, bought lanterns, got the dwarven wire and some micro servers. I then tried to make the bow and failed. The proper result for someone who was too cocky and had only enough supplies for one attempt.<br><br>This of course means that I now have to repeat the whole process. More lanterns, and now I await the slow boat to the Kiola Nut islands. <br><br>I did get some experience from all this when I had Trumpy make me his tonics (and the like), but I'm going to get 2 stacks of everything this time round, and I'm going to get my fletching skill up further than it's current 151.<br><br>Wish me luck and patience. And why don't the PTB let people fish on the boats? That's my question.<br><br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

I retreated to safer grounds and explored Rivervale and Misty Thicket. <br><br>I decided to check out the home of the wood elves, and there I decided to do the Trueshot Quests. I decided to let the newbies get me the needed items while I played guardian. This worked pretty well since my paltry 33 heal worked real well on the newbies. I assembled the pieces I needed (I still had some Pinescout Armor believe it or not) and then moved on to explore the Faydarks, Butcherblock and Steamfont Mt.<br><br>I hooked up with a friend to retrieve a water ring in Dagnors Caldron and then after a day fruitlessly searching for a Dark Assassin for a guildmate, went to get gems off Ice Giants. Not much success there, and the guildmate bought me some of the jewels. I also received some better armor and weapons from the same guildmate, and now my hit points are in the 20s instead a weak and pathetic 10ish. I also managed to get my archery skills up, and can now get critical hits with the bow, albet on lower creatures only. <br><br>After spending the rest of my meager earnings on some enhancing jewelry (and meeting a great jewelry craftsman in the process), I decided it was time to make money and level up.<br><br>I returned to Luclin and attempted to group in Dawnshroud with no success. I went and killed some things in Marus Seru and in Echo Caverns. Then I returned to DSP and finally found a group. Ding to level 31. I returned the next day and found one of yesterdays group members. This turned out to be a phenominal group, two rangers, one cleric, one enchanter, a warrior and a druid. At one time we had 5 lightcrawlers, 2 wolves, and 1 zelniak. We triumphed in a display of prowess and unity I had yet to see. By the end of the day I was at level 33. <br><br>Onward! Woot! <br>Hunt long and Safe<br>Donilla Deverry<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This day was much as many days past. Again I found myself fighting wisps for the money and rats for the whiskers.<br><br>I had a chance this day to take my revenge on Gnasher Furgutt. I smote, and I smited and I took his head off! He tried to drive fear in my heart by threatening that his human friends would take his revenge. I will stay clear of the guards I believe to be those humans. And for good measure I killed Yollis the poacher for the third time.<br><br>In my peacefull home glade I practiced my fletching while I fished for lunch. I headed for Qeynos to practice my brewing skills. After that I took advantage of the spells of a friend to head into Blackburrow well buffed for the hunt. My first act was to run in cowardice when the Gnoll Courier I attacked proved stronger than I.<br><br>Snowl (now a L10) gave me a good clue about where to look for rat whiskers, and while he continued to run in circles, I re-entered the burrow. I hunted alone, fear always present in my throat. As might be predicted, I was soon overwhelmed, and had a long hungry trek to my corpse.<br><br>I joined a group with Radiias, and then found myself completely disoriented. I had new eyes with which to see Norrath, and I found the increased textures and details such that I no longer knew my way about. Our group soon increased to include Nanadiena. In one attack we lost Nana, and soon thereafter, our own lives. We returned to fight in the snake pit, in cooperation with another group of adventurers. Our group increased to include Baldaek (10 Rouge). Myriad deaths (ours) and victories (also ours) against snakes and gnolls. We finally fought our way to the entrance where we disbanded, and where I was met by friend Landa.<br><br>It was time to go on a tour of my blessed Norrath. Landa was my guide as we began our tour with a run through the Western Plains of Karana. We headed for the water and passed through a fishing village. Onward to the corn fields where I battled some scarecrows. We proceeded to the Northern Plains of Karana and ran until we reached the spires marking the teleport to Luclin. We crossed a very long bridge into the Southern Plains, a land populated by Mammoths and Centaurs. We ventured deep into the territory, to the hunting spires. Then we headed north to return to the water. <br><br>We returned to NK where we took our place in the teleporter to Luclin. The trip to the moon was swift and not too disorienting. We ported again to Shadow&nbsp;&nbsp;whence I bounded my soul, toured a bit of the city, and then visited the bazaar. From Shadow Haven we headed into the depths of the Paludal Caverns. We ventured in, skittering high up on the walls to avoid the denizens of the floor. After a few successfull battles patog phlarg fiends, we grew cocky and I soon paid the price, death. I had great difficulty finding my was back to my corpse, and was immediately killed again. It was necessary for Landa to drag my corpse to a safer haven, and it was decided that perhaps the caverns were yet too difficult a place for me to hunt.<br> <br>We returned to North Karana through the Nexus where I cast camoflague upon myself to insure my safety as we passed into East Karana. Landa levitated me so that I would not harm myself falling into the many ravines and gorges dotting the terrain on the way to High Pass. I discovered that I could navigate in the air, going both higher and lower to the ground. On occasion I thought I would float so I high I didn't need the Nexus to reach the moon.<br><br>This turned out to be a very dangerous place, and many times I floated or disappeared in the face of danger. At the edge of the Kithicor Woods camped until 8am, to ensure that all signs of darkness, and the monsters dwelling therein, had left the woods to the light. We passed the tunnel leading to the home of the Halflings. In just over an hour we were in the West Commonlands, where I headed due east until I reached the zone into West Freeport.<br><br>We entered into city of Freeport and wound our way through the city to the soulbinder in the east section. Then we headed straight into the Deserts of Northern Ro. This place is full of zoombies and madmen, along with various crocodiles and orcs. We ventured briefly into the Oasis, but night was falling and it was time to end the long run. Traveling along the water, where it is safe, we reached a fishing village, and a few shorts steps north, reached a small village with an inn where I could find respit for the eveining.<br><br>It was a long run, but I now have new and dangerous lands to explore.<br>Hunt long and safe.<br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I awoke this morning with the redwoods towering over my head. <br><br>Yesterdays hunting had increased my experience, and I was now ready to receive my next level of spells. I sat down with my spell book and my fishing rod, and bent to my studies.<br><br>I am disturbed by black tidings sweeping the forest. A message most distrubing is whispered from ear to ear.<br><br>&quot;Strange events are occurring across Norrath! The protectors of Jaggedpine defend Surefall Glade against advancing Gnolls. The howling of wolves are heard in plains and mountains. Across the world events like these are waiting to be discovered.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A glacial current of wind, seemingly consumed, with anger and hatred, devours the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commontion from the Hills of Qeynos becomes evident as barking and howling beings in a low murmur, escalating into a chorus of war.  What will become of the serenity that is Qeynos Hills, and its neighboring village of Surefall Glade? Will once quiet lands be swarming with Gnolls? What could they be up to?&quot;<br><br>I shook off my gloom and headed for the Hills where I was able to join up with Thelous, my Druid friend. We were joined by his hunting companion Snowl (L6 Druid). It was time to hunt rats and bats. It was my task to track, snare and heal.<br>When we ran into Tovax Vmar and his pet, it was time for the younglings to run, and for me to battle for all I was worth. The fight was tough and perilous, but victory was mine.<br><br>Our hunting resumed but only for a short while, until it was time to return to our camps.<br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I awoke to another dawn, and another day on the look out for whiskers and globes. The tediousness of it all began to get to me and I tracked down Yollis Jenkins once again so that I might behead him a second time. Petty I realize, but it made me feel challanged at the least.<br><br>Gruah (Funamoor's alt) stopped me to say hello, and we decided we might spend the day together on the hunt. We headed on the path to Blackburrow and headed for the nether regions of the burrow. We joined into a party with Gobab and successfully brought sorrow to the gnolls. Gobab and Gruah departed and I was joined by Funamoor (L8 Ranger). We decided it was time to foray into new territory, Jagged Pine. <br><br>A touch of the jewel like teleporter and we found ourselves in a immense cavern, with fungus covered walls and winding passways. We seemed to be able to pass by the local residents without garnering much attention, we was a fortunate thing, considering the prowess of the locals.<br><br>We passed through a pool of anchorites of Brellis to reach Oracle Jaarl. His bone necklaces rattled as he implored us to show respect to his deity. We vowed to do so, and then continued on our explorations. We found the local merchant hall and vault, conducted some small business, and headed down a passage to a forest inhabited by dyrads and emmense trees. We walked about with cautious steps, so as to not fall foul of the folks dwelling in this strange land. <br><br>We soon returned to BB and had to battle our way out of the burrow. The days battles were great for my education, and I dinged to Level 15. I also found another quest designed to bring troubles to the gnolls. Marching Orders, invasion plans, area maps, and encryption keys, all to thwart their dasterdly intent.<br><br>I camped this night at my home, Surefall. It's good to be among friends.<br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The dawn light spilled through the window of m y tavern room in South Qeynos, and I to another day of adventuring.<br><br>I started the morning preparing my food and drink for the day. I was intent on raising my domestic skills, and to some extant, I succeeded. While it is not my goal to become a master chef, I am getting much to tired of the same food stuffs day in and day out.<br><br>Next I went to our local merchants to sell the goods I had acquired during the previous days hunt.<br><br>My set task, to complete the Pine Scout Armor quest, was to be the order of yet another day. I set out with bow and sword to hunt rats for their whiskers and wil-o-wisps for their money making lightstones. I remain short of coin, and while I would prefer to live off the land where coin is not required, I have lately been lodging in Qeynos, for the access it provides to ovens and stills.<br><br>I ran into a young adventurer who required a guide to Blackburrow, a task I was happy to take on, and I stood guard as he hunting along the way.<br><br>It was on the way back from this task that I ran into mishap. It was of my own doing really, I forgot to keep my eyes looking around me. I ran smack into Gnasher Furgutt, and smack into my doom. I suffered significant wounds before I even realized what, or who, was upon me, and I took off for the nearby guards, hoping for assistance and sanctuary. I was to receive neither. <br><br>While I had passed the shop and its guards before without and incling of danger, this time was markedly different. I had not realized Guard's Sironan and Yalroen harbored such dislike of Rangers. Especially seeing as how they are stationed in Qeynos Hills, the very heart of Ranger territory. Instead of swinging their swords to my aid, the went to the aide of Gnasher instead, and I soon found myself a restless soul seeking my corpse.<br><br>I took my revenge not on the guards, but on Yollis Jenkins. While the cost was high, I was the victor, and took his head in victory. In return, I knew I would receive a rusty pine scout sword, and a chance to try my hand at the smithing skill of sharpening.<br><br>On the path to SureFall, I ran into a young Druid, and saw a chance to pass on some booty I had looted while in Blackburrow. I told Thelous about the quest for the Pine Druid Armor, and gave to him those pieces of ruined gnoll leather I could not use for myself. It&nbsp;&nbsp;is such a pleasure to find a new adventurer, excited about starting out.<br><br>We paid a visit to SFG together, and then we headed back out for the hunt, where I took it as my duty to keep the youngster alive. I also had a chance to make a trade, my stack of bones for some ruined pelts. I was also fortunate to run into Faredon in the Hills. As I had vowed earlier, I knelt to him in continued thanks for his assistance and his gifts.<br><br>We hunted through the day, and then after saying our goodbyes, I killed a few snakes for their eggs on my way back to Qeynos. It was time to hit the ovens o prepare my dinner and brew my drink.<br><br>This night chose to camp amongst the stars and made my camp.<br><br>Hunt long and live safe<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Sep  7 16:02:40 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Another attempt to complete the pine scout quest and yet another zig in the path. <br><br>Once again I joined Troilen for some hunting in Blackburrow. And right off the bat, I got myself killed on the way to the Elite room. I tried to run away, tried to swim away, tried to climb the ladder away, all to no avail. There I was, floating above my corpse, lying on the bottom of the lake. Troilen loved it, but I least I didn't drown, really, I got bashed to death by two swimming guardsmen. Maybe that's just as funny though. I did find out you can drag a corpse up the ladder. Very useful that.<br><br>I eventually became part of a group that camped the Green/Elite room. Troilen and I were joined by Therra, with whom I've battled before. Bard Faredon helped us clean out the Elite room (it filled with&nbsp;&nbsp;three elites and one commander while we were gone) by mezzing the commander while we took the other three. Nice tool, that mezz. He stayed a bit to fight and sang us to full health and manna.  Then he moved on. Thanks Faredon.<br><br>We were joined soon thereafter by Taramac. He had a cool trick and we soon found ourselves literally walking on air. Fighting from a floating position was a unique experience, and I'm glad I got a chance to do it. I ended up leading the group because Troilen kept going LD. Taramac also ended up staying a while, pulling, giving us buffs, and keeping us healthy. He shared in lifting an ale to good hunting and we indulged in some drunken schenanigans<br><br>Reminder to self, get some batwings to give to Taramac so he float some other people. He also gave me some giant scale mail boots, and a blackened alloy coif, plus a bloodstained mantle, all with stats. I can only presume that this high level residents of the realm deem this their job, and I sincerly pray that I will one day be in a position to render such assistance to others. Eventually Taramac moved on, to help some others I presume. I will kneel to him whenever I see him.<br><br>We sought to increase our group, and were eventually joined by Lythander. We were now a L14 Half Elf Ranger, a L12 Druid Wood Elf, a L16 Barbarian Warrior, and a L16 Human Warrior. A good group. And soon Sirbere was again with us. Another L15 Barbarian Warrior. With all these tanks, Lyth and I need only to throw some spells and buffs, and melee only to fight with our friends. I also learned that I can jump onto things, and I sat on top of the barrel, with a great view of the entire room.<br><br>The realworld intruded and when I returned, I found myself alone, with Lyth's corpse at the entrance and everyone else scattered. Apparently they had drawn a bit more than they could chew. How I stayed alive I'll never know. But there were now two elite guardsmen in the room, and I had to carefully sneak out. I regrouped with Therra, Lythander retrieved his corpse, and the group disbanded.<br><br>Lyth returned with me to Qeynos, for I belived I had some ruined leather armor he could use for the Druid version of the pinescout quest. I was wrong, but I was able to give him some silk, and sundries. As always when I return home, I brew, bake and tailor whatever relevent supplies I've picked up during the day. <br><br>Then it was the end of another day in Norrath.<br><br>Donilla<br>Hunt long and safe<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

I would need silk, and whiskers.<br><br>Once again I was side tracked by the chance to battle once again within the depths of Blackburrow. A friend, Troilen, a L15 Human Warrior, was already battling within, and I hastened to join him. We waged battle on the island with the wooden struction, and on the ledge near the bridge.<br><br>Much battling, much healing, and much experience ensued. We ran from a train, and killed a plague rat while we waited for it to disburse. We descended once again, and camped out at the Brewers ledge, but we were unsuccessful in our search for a cask.&nbsp;&nbsp;My good friend Wingurin (L31 Barbarian Shaman) dropped by to give us some buffs, and decided to stick around and play mentor to us for a while. <br><br>We descended once again to the Elite or Green room. And with Wingurins help, we were able to take on bigger and badder meanies, with the expected boost in experience. Wingurin transformed into his bear form. the first time I had seen this transformation. Lythand (L10 Druid Wood Elf) joined as well, another friend with whom I have battled in the past. With this happy grouping, Troilen soon dinged to L16, and we celebrated with a swing of Black Burrow Stout. We were joined by another old companion, Sirbere (L16 Barbarian Warrior), and not long thereafter, I met my first Iksar, and Zarsh (L15 Monk) joined us as well.<br><br>I had the pleasure of seeing an Iksar doing the Iksar walk and run full tilt around our little room. Apparently they are easily bored and quite hyper. Made for an enjoyable show.<br> <br>I was thrilled to ding to L14 in the midst of all the carnage. Another celebration and another swig of stout. Eventually, our protector left us. Our group was now of sufficient size for us to protect ourselves. We battled a Gnoll Tactician and looted some Black Burrow Battle Plans. Some research will be required to determine what quest this is for, although Zarsh indicated it was for a gimp? quest.<br><br>We lost Lythander to an elite gnoll guard. I also got my first sight of a Monk feigning death. It was hysterical. She dropped straight down like a board, lay there, and then popped straight back up - fabulous. Bigtoad graced us with some buffs. And traded me the last piece of ruined chain armor, the bracer, I needed to complete my armor quest. And another visual first, I got to see my first transformation to wolf form.<br><br>I also got two Onyx earrings, and an obsidian ring, both with stats. And of course after a time, the party began to disband, one by one. And then it my turn. Zarsh came with me to the entrance, and then I headed to Qeynos. I deviated from my path long enough to hunt some giant field rats, but none dropped what I needed.<br><br>In town I worked on my tailoring and brewing skills. I also had to purchase another quiver since I stupidly destroyed mine. And then I fletched some arrows and then called it a day.<br><br>Donilla<br>Hunt long and safe.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This day I was determined to solo, and to travel to less well known territories. I headed for West Karana.<br><br>I explored the shops in the North, and ran into Brother Estle and promised to bring him back some Blessed Oil. I hunted lions for their pelts, and grizzlies for their exp. And spiders for their silk. There was a foot race going on, but I declined to participate since I did not know my way to Misty Thicket. Maybe another day.<br><br>I met my match in a Grizzly and had to make my way back. Landa dropped by to give me some buffs so that I might live through my next encounter with the grizzly. I paid a visit to the Miller family, but stayed out of the cornfield. Something about scarecrows, a rumor I heard somewhere.<br><br>I returned to Qeynos, conducted business and then went to get Brother Estles's oil. I ran out of time and made camp near the Temple of Life.<br><br>The next morning I awoke and got the oil from Nomsoe Jusagta. And then headed to WK to bring the oil to B. Estle. He was happy to receive it, and he blessed me on my way. I continued to hunt lions and grizzlies, and to explore this land. I tried my hand at fishing in the Barbarian fishing village and then moved on.<br><br>Unfortunately I ventured too far. I found myself at what I learned later was the Ogre Shrine. I was smote once, then twice, and then I was dead. I returned to WK, but was consumed with much fear at the thought of having to venture once again into the area of that shrine.<br><br>I searched the area and saw there was a L51 High Elf Elementalist on the road named Qalamdarl of the Misty Knight guild. I beseeched his assistance, which he granted, and with his protection, I was able to drag my corpse away from danger. Qalamdarl would take nothing in exchange for his assistance except my heartfelt gratitude, and I followed him back to Qeynos.<br><br>A warning to all you adventurers. Those stone monolithes? Each is accompanied by an Ogre, and they will protect their Holy place. Beware. <br><br>I returned safely to my bed, with lessons well learned this day.<br><br>Donilla<br>Hunt long and safe<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I started the day with my fletching kit before me and the wooden shafts, feathers, points and nocks spread all around me. The success and failures were about even, but in the end, I was in possession of a full quiver of arrows. The extras I sold, and then I headed out.<br><br>I sent a few tells to some friends, Qualestra and Peano, both were enjoying their endeavers far afield.<br><br>I decided to head for Everfrost to gather some more spiderling silk. I tracked and killed a few giant field rats along the way. I've heard that Chilled Tundra Root was hard to scrounge, but I scrounged up yet another, which automatically was destroyed since I already had one in my possession. I hope that those trying to find this item persist, it is out there.<br><br>I paid another visit to Halas, and did my banking and trade work while I explored the town. I choose to swim the channel like the local inhabitants, with no harm to myself. I returned to my hunt for spiderlings. Then returned to Surefall Glade. I made a quick mail delivery for the Bards. And then it was back to the whisker search.<br><br>I went to meet my friend Landa at the Q.Hills Guard tower. There I ran into one of the first people I met when I entered this land, Everrain (L9 Half Elf Ranger). It was she who gave me my first piece of armor, which stood me in great stead. She hadn't visited&nbsp;&nbsp;Norrath since then, and found herself having to start over from the beginning. I was sorry I had nothing on me to return the favor.<br><br>In the end Everrain and I left with Landa and headed for Blackburrow. Even with Landa there, it was not possible to avoid death, and so we died. We regrouped to hunt some more. Everrain left and Landa and I continued on. I joined up with a L13  Warrior named Grindal. I learned that all those copper coins sure get you encumbered fast. Too bad you can't change the coins outside of the bank.<br><br>And finally, I dinged. Welcome to L13!!<br><br>And with the days goal achieved, it was time to head for home and rest up for another day.<br><br>Donilla <br>Hunt long and safe<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This day I left Qeynos and headed for the Hills. Once again I was on the hunt for the elusive Giant Field Rat, actually the elusive whiskers. And yet again, frustration ruled the hunting.<br><br>My friend SK Peano told me to look up a friend of his, Qualestra, a L15 Dark Elf who was currently questing in Blackburrow. I did so, even though I'm starting to worry about all the chaos/evil<br>aligned friends I've been making. As a ranger I should be avoiding all such creatures. But with the common goal of battling the gnolls, and the sure knowledge that they are as friendly and helpful as all other inhabitants of this land, it's hard to justify such prejudice, and even harder to deny myself the company of such companions.<br><br>In any case, I received an invitation to join her and some friends in the Green Room, which I headed for with some verbal instructions. She met me along the way and escorted me to her companions. <br><br>Our company was Manicor a L14 Necromancer Dark Elf, Lythand A L10 Druid Wood Elf, and Beromir a L13 Warrior Barbarion. As soon as I arrived I found myself in the thick of battle. We camped and pulled and fought. We moved camp, and pulled and fought. We were joined by a friend of Beromir's, Therra a L14 Warrior Barbarian. It turns out Therra was still swordless for some reason, and on one of our forays back to the bank, I gifted her with a Longsword (that turned<br>out to be a bit of a mix up, but that's another story) that was too heavy for me to wield. We moved back to the green room and continued the hunt. One fight became a very near thing for me, but with healing spells and two tanks, death was averted, although recovery did take some time.<br><br>I had a chance to introduce Nick to the group, but there was no room for him in the group. He fought beside us non-the-less. The biggest news of the night was that I dinged to L12, Yipee. Everyone did a dance of joy, Nick moved on the other hunting grounds, and we battled on. Items, food and spells passed on from one to the other. We shared a swig of beer to celebrate my ding. There were times when some of the party came near to death, and times when the battles were easy.<br> <br>We decided to head for the Command Room, and finally, the good luck ended. We engaged a manageable group of gnolls, and they aggrod, and<br>a train came thru, and then some of us were dead. I recovered my corpse and was guarded by the group while I redressed. Therra was the last to return and the hunting continued. I went major LD and by the time I returned, everyone but Therra and Qualestra has left. I rejoined them, but our remaining time in BB was short, and Therra and I headed for Qeynos to sell off our loot. I was able to show Therra the town. And then we took our leave. <br><br>Another day, another death, another<br>ding.<br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>Donilla <br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>
