The Tesch Mas Gnolls were the big brothers of the Gnolls Tad used to kill back in Blackburrow.   These Gnolls had some knowledge of magic and of course hit harder then their younger siblings.   The Teshmass also usually were found to carry Fine Steel Weapons worth 4-5 pp each and some other magic leather armor as well as some other odds and ends, usually magic based.   <br><br>At age 32 Tad found that he could kill one Tesch Mas Gnoll after another without stopping until his magic grew week and he had to sit down and meditate for a while, usually after about 7 or 8 Gnolls.    Though the Spires were heavily hunted most of the time Tad found that in the early hours there would be no more then maybe one other person in the area and he could kill all the Gnolls he wanted without ever seeing another hunter.    <br><br>Although Tad had killed many of the little Aviak birds of South Karana he could still do business with the Vendor in the Aviak town if he was Sneaky enough.   This made it easy for Tad to unload all the loot from the Gnolls and saved a longer run to the Centaur village on the Northeastern side of the zone.  Even with that Tad would always go out of his way to kill more Gnolls, as this was a rivalry Tad had no desire to resolve!   After all these dogs were meant to walk down low on all fours with the rest of the animals not up high on two legs with the Half Elves and other superior races! <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/sly.gif> <br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jul 29 05:24:32 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

Now a young man of 31 Tad finds that not much has changed with the one exception of the book teleport to the Plain of Knowledge.  <br><br><br>Though large and powerful Tad found the Wooly Mammoths easy to fear, the trick was finding a spot were you would not bump into other Wooly Mammoth while fighting.   Though Tad could now handle two Wooly Mammoths at once he preferred to avoid it if possible.  Just across the river at the small open ruins to the north proved to be a good location to wait for the wandering mammoths to lumber by.   Snare, DOT and Fear seemed to be the easy way of taking these lumbering creatures down.   The loot was good and the average seemed to be about one good Tusk per Mammoth.    <br><br><br>Once Tad had his Backpacks full of 13 to 14 tusks <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/grin.gif>  he would head to the vendor, Starn Bearjumper, and sell the large bulky treasures.  With his highly charismatic ways <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/cool.gif>  Tad easily got 10+ platinum pieces for each tusk he sold and soon he would have to make his way to the bank in Halas as he found himself weighed down with hundreds of Platinum pieces.   Maybe this wet cold way of life wasnt so bad after all!?  <br><br>Unfortunately this was also a very well known hunting spot for other wanders of Tads age.  Tad soon realized the best time for him to go out and hunt the cold barren waste was during the wee hours of the morning while most fellow creatures were a sleep.   And still, though a lost cause, Tad found the wandering undead hated him to the core and would not miss the chance to jump Tad from behind <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/mad.gif> even though it meant a quick brutal second death for them.  To there own fault Tad always had a pile of bone chips in his backpack!  <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/grin.gif> <br><br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jul 29 05:28:55 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

Though the Aviak Avocet was few and far between Tad would pick off all the other little Aviaks as he tracked down the elusive Avocet.   The Aviaks Avocets provide good loot <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/smile.gif> and decent experience, as the Aviak Darters had before them.   <br><br>Though hunting in the city was good one had to be very careful on the upper levels not to fall over the side.   One missed step and the sudden stopping power of the ground 100 feet below would knock almost anyone back to their home town! <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/frown.gif>  As well while in the &quot;Penthouse&quot; you had to pay attention as not to start a riot and find yourself running from a dozen or so of these dodo birds!  <br><br>More and more hunters were learning of the good prey to be had in this area so Tad was finding it a little more difficult to locate a good hunting spot. <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/disappointed.gif>  None-the-less the Avocets put up a good enough fight that Tad always had lots of time to spare between fights as he recuperated.  Picking off the little birds was always a good way to spend this time as the little Half Elf could always use some extra platinum!  And it was especially nice to know that the Aviaks, as well as the Centaurs, never held a grudge against Tad for his past indiscretions against them.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jul 29 05:33:15 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

The <br><br>Crag Spiders would wander around the zone if given the chance so Tad did his best to make sure they never had the opportunity keeping them herded around the central mountains!    Should trouble arise it was an average run to the bridge to North Karana or the Gorge of King Xorbb but the run of the cliff path to High Pass was just to far.   <br><br>Tad always enjoyed East Karana because the vendors had just about anything Tad would need.  Merchant Bryan sells cheap ready made arrows so Tad wasted no time making his own, except to improve his fletching skill.   A good bow and some cheap arrows was all Tad need to kill the beasts while increasing his archery skill!   <br><br>Pulling the Crag spiders one at a time up the east gorge towards High Pass was a great spot.   As long as he could pull one at a time there was little risk but get a second or third on your tail you will pray your root spell holds!  One at a time Tad would beat the Crag Spider down with snare, root and arrows until the root broke then it was a quick Fire Spell and finish off hand to hand using his club or sword along with his Chitin Shell Shield to help protect him from the lethal spider poison.  <br><br>With the vendors close by Tad always made sure he was loaded up with the arrows and bandages.  When his health dropped below 50 there were no worries for Tad as he always had his poison remedy spell ready to go.   Then Tad would just practice his bandaging skill and then used his minor heal spell and be at 100% in no time.   The venom sacks were always a plus to find as the vendors paid a small stash of gold for each one.   After a few season of this Tad had filled his bank with gold and stacks of silk for to practice his tailoring.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

As the stranger is swimming around collecting the local fish Tad jumps in and begins his workout.  The young lady proves to be a real distraction for Tad having spent all his time alone in the woods!  <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/inlove.gif>    Soon there is a little Piranha nibbling on Tads toes.    Frustrated with the little pest Tad turns and begins to slay the little critter.  Glub...Glub...Glub...     Tad regains consciousness back at home!    Tads new friend asks,&quot;What happened?&quot;    Tad being to embarrassed to say a little fish beat him begins to spin his first fish story about a Piranha the size of a Grizzly bear!    It was amazing!  I had never seen a fish that big, Tad exclaimed!    Did you see that thing kick my backside? &quot;No?&quot;  Of course she didnt, it didnt happen.   Dough! <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/banghead.gif>    Tad soon realizes he had forgotten to cast his &quot;Enduring Breath&quot; so he could breath under water!  Glub...Glub...Glub...   Oh what could be worse telling a BIG FISH story or the TRUTH?  Tad breaks down and tells her what happened and they both have a good laugh.   She could not resist this Half Elf with the bruised pride.  The next morning they awoke, said there goodbyes and Tad went away a MAN.  :o   Tad thinks to himself those little people sure no a thing or two!    Well...

Not only was Tad tracking new creatures he was finally getting some decent loot again.  <br><br>The Centaurs proved hard hitters for Tad and very fast as well.  The fact that most of them dropped arrows and bows did not out way the damage Tad would take in hand to hand fighting and with the range of the Centaurs bow it seemed a lost cause.    On the other hand the Aviaks Darters and Egrets were almost always found to be holding some semi-precious stones that would easily translate into platinum pieces with the vendors.   Though also fast the little Aviaks were good hunting and more then doable for Tad.<br><br>Keeping an eye out for the occasional wandering Aviak Harrier, Rook and Avocet so as not to back into one while disposing of a fledgling Aviak was the real trick.   The area was large and it was a good run to get to any worthwhile vendors for supplies and safety for that mater.   Tad made sure he stocked up on arrows and bandages before going out to hunt South Karana.   <br><br>The Tesch Mas Gnolls seemed to be a favorite of the local hunters but the Aviaks could be found wandering all over the zone so a good tracker could make it here with little problems and Tad had proven to be a good tracker.    With only a small group of Shadow night to the Northwest, a band of undead to the North and a few wandering trouble makers Tad had little to worry about, mostly the long run to safety should he get himself into trouble.   <br><br>A few seasons and a few dozens trips to the Vendors of East Karana and Tad was feeling pretty comfortable about his new hunting ground and had made a small purse full of platinum in the mean time.  This all changed when a DIRTY Gnoll did a sneak attack on Tad.   Just north of the Centaur camp Tad had finished off one of the little birds and set down to recuperate before heading out.  While resting his eyes Tad hears a great noise that awakens him from his deep slumber.   It seems that someone nearby is using some pretty powerful magic!  Tad stands up and turns around only to find a Gnoll by the name Zrithsadioun is the one using the great magic and it is Tad that Zrithsadioun is practicing on!    Tad drawls his weapons and begins to fight back only to land a few hits and have his opponent turn and run.   This is when Tad first realizes he is in big trouble!   Tad is frozen in place unable to give chase or even retreat.    Not only is Tad frozen but Tad has also been stricken with a nasty spell draining his life force away and fast.  Tad immediately begins to bandage and heal himself and eventually is able to break the root spell and run for the safety of North Karana.    Unfortunately Zrithsadiouns spell was to powerful for Tad and within sight of the bridge Tad falls unconscious.   <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/cry.gif> <br><br>Back at home Tad is trying to comprehend this odd form of battle tactic Zrithsadioun has used on him, a very effective form of hit and run.  Tad soon learns that he is not the first to fall pray to Zrithsadioun and his unusual battle tactic as he has rendered many a mighty warrior helpless.   Knowing this Tad gathers his remaining pride and heads back to South Karana to gather his things, now keeping a sharp Elven eye out for the nasty Gnoll called !  <img border=0 src=/shared/smilies/yikes.gif> <br> <br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jul 22 04:27:07 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

Though the Carrion spiders were no longer a challenge for Tad the Gorge Hounds and Dark Stalkers proved to be great combat experience for him and he could still kill the spiders and collect silk for his tailoring as well.   Tad would have to wait a few more years before he could take on the Crag Spiders which had a powerful venom but would provide more silk then there weaker brethren.    Pulling Gorge Hounds up the ramp to the Gorge of King Xorbb was a great spot for Tad to hunt.  Though at high noon it was not uncommon to find a few other hunters in the same area there were always plenty of hounds to go around.  <br><br>On one occasion Tad was thankful for being so close to the Gorge when he found himself being jumped by a Dark Stalker.  It seems the Dark Stalkers did not take kindly to Tad killing off all of the Gorge hounds.   The perfect time for the Dark Stalker to jump Tad, while he was working one of the poor little Gorge Hounds.   Having been jumped before Tad took no chances anymore and ran straight for the zone!    Safe for a change, Tad had learned something!   Back down the ramp with a keen eye out for the Dark Stalkers.   Tads hunger for wolf meat grew.  Many Hounds will die this day and a few Dark Stalkers would follow!<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

True to form Kizdean did not wait for Tad to get very close when Kizdean ran straight for Tad on the attack.   Just what Tad was waiting for!    Tad unleashed his dual wield and double attack skill on Kizdean.   Though Tad was much faster and kept Kizdean from casting many of his spells Kizdean was able to get a few spells off and cripple Tad.  Though short it was a very brutal fight and Tad made it out by the skin of his teeth.   Limping away it felt good to finally put Kizdean in his place!   <br><br>While in the neighborhood Tad decided to check the pond out and see how the Piranha hunting was.   The Piranhas were no longer worth hunting it turned out.   While sitting on the beach gazing across the pond Tad noticed someone running around the pond from the other side.  Must be another hunter, Tad thought to himself.  Tad stands and turns toward the fast advancing stranger to engage in some friendly conversation.  At the last second Tad recognizes the unmistakable blue shaded skin of a DARK ELF.  Just then the stranger, Dragoon Zytl, begins to beat Tad.  Tad begins to fight back but soon realizes this is Kizdean Gix&amp;#8217;s big friend and he is taking revenge on Tad.  Tad, realizing there is no hope in wining this battle, turns and trys to make a break for it.  After two or three steps Tad wakes up back at home.  What?  Huh?  What happened!?

As a little half elf Tad had spent time in Qeynos rubbing elbows with the locals and trying desperately to find out where the big boat would take him if he could manage to slip aboard.   While waiting for the boat Tad sees Faren and decides to try and get a few spare copper pieces off him.   Tad sits down next to Faren and begins to fish after all every boy should learn to fish.  After fishing a while Tad begins to start a little small talk with Faren, Faren ignores Tad.  A little longer and Tad then asks Faren if he can spare a few pieces of copper, Faren continues to ignores Tad.  Tad, not willing to admit defeat, continues to ask Faren for some spare change ignoring Farens request to leave him alone!  The next thing you know Tad is getting whipped by Farens fishing pole.  Tad ended up back at home trying to recover and realized that when someone says go-away they mean it!    <br><br>Tad, now much wiser, only hones his begging skill on those smaller then him should they happen to turn on him like Faren did all those years ago.    As an adolescent in preparation for his experience with the cute little girl elves Tad did some practicing of sorts on the local fish to safely build his confidence, some things he will never tell!  Remembering the safety of the fish, hummmm, Tad decides to try out begging the Fish now.  Surely no fish will have money!!   Well.....anything is possible right?   NO!   After hours of begging the local FISH Tad finally walked away, no richer.  Though despite not making any money Tad did in fact improve his begging technique!   Looks like those Fish were good for more then a couple of things, and Tad swore he would never tell what some of them were!!!<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

Ahhh, sweet revenge, Tad says with glee.  Taking Gnashers head as a trophy as well as a small note Gnasher had been carrying, Tad continues on his merry way to Surefall Glades.  First stop is to see his old friend Larsk Juton.  Knowing Larsks hatred of Gnasher Tad holds up the head of Gnasher to the shear delight of Larsk!   Larsk quickly snatches Gnashers head from Tads hand and dances about like a mad man then turns to Tad and praises him.  Tad then remembers the note he had found on Gnasher and gives it to Larsk to see if he can make anything of it!  Larsk looks at the note and hands it back to Tad urging him to take it directly to Guard Captain Tillin in Qeynos.  Tad remembers good Captain Tillin and his shared contempt for the Gnolls and tucks the note back in his tunic for safe keeping until he can pay Captain Tillin a visit.  While in Surefall Glades Tad also stops in to see good old Hager Sureshot and get a much-needed update on his skills.    A bit of catching up with the folks and a brief swim around the pond and Tad set out for Qeynos.<br>	<br>	Tad quickly makes his way to the Arena and Guard Captain Tillin.  Captain Tillin remembers Tad fondly as the little Half Elf that collected Gnoll fangs for him.  Captain Tillin takes a look and the note and a grim look sweeps over his face.  It seems that the bartender, Mcneal Jocub, of Fishs Ale has been involved in some missing shipments of Blackburrow Stout.  Ahhh Haaaa!  Tad remembers Mcneal as the bartender that befriended Tad and gave him Blackburrow Stout in exchange for Moonstones.  Tad tells the Captain of this and now even further enraged Captain Tillin orders the execution of Mcneal Jocub.  Feeling a bit uneasy about possibly causing the death of a friend Tad runs to Fishs Ale to worn Mcneal Jocub but only arrives in time to see Mcneal dispatched by the Executioner.   No more drinks for Tad at Fishs Ale!   Now might be a good time to head back to the Karanas!?<br><br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jun 17 03:24:31 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

What is a Muddite Minor?   This clump of oozing mud seems to stroll along with some purpose.... the purpose of being killed!   Tad attacks this moving mass of earth and makes pretty short work of the little mud pie.   Tads reward, a small block of clay and a small piece of ore.   Looks like someone will be working on his Blacksmithing and Pottery skills!?   Killing this Muddites could save Tad lots of copper pieces and the Muddite Elders would also improve Tads combat skills.  <br><br>Tad continues to fill his inventory with the heavy clay and ore and then he gets a surprise.   Tad gets a mud pie in his eyes!  The lights go out but Tad is still being hit.  Using his other senses Tad continues to push forward and fight.  Soon his sight is back and he quickly finishes of the play-doe kid.   So, the Muddites will throw mud in your eyes and keep punching you. Tad quickly learns that as long as you listen and creep forward and keep swinging you will keep doing damage.   <br><br>On occasion Tad would loot some Heavy Clay which was great for selling.  He would later find out this Heavy Clay was used by the higher skilled potters and very valuable.   On occasion Tad would also loot a silver bar and really cash in.    <br><br>Venturing deeper into the Gorge Tad was seeking the hive of Evil Eyes he had heard about.   On this short journey Tad meets his first Gorge Minotaur.   The Minotaurs were a brutish creature being half mussel bound man and half bull, better part Bull of course.   Large creatures built to fight they hit Tad pretty hard and he wasnt sticking around to find out just how tough this Minotaur was.   <br><br>Tad looses the Minotaur and himself in the process.  He continues to keep to the right and work his way north.  Suddenly Tad sees one of the Evil Eyes.   He gets into position and hits the Evil Eye with his best damage spell.  The Evil Eyes pet goes after Tad.  The pet doesnt hit to hard and Tad ignores it and continues to go after the magic casting Evil Eye knowing they are not good at melee fighting.   However being good at magic Tad soon finds himself in a dream like state.  Soon Tad wakes up and the Evil Eye he though he was fighting is gone, darn that magic!   <br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Jun  4 01:02:40 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

The fellow Ranger remembering his own struggles as a youth, offers Tad his old Tailored Quiver.  Fufnski had just made his own Fleeting Quiver and was looking for a young Ranger to pass down his old quiver too.   In the right place at the right time Tad was overwhelmed by his new friends kindness.   <br><br>Tad also learned from the great Fufnski there was even better hunting for a young Ranger working on his tailoring farther West in East Karana.  Tad remembered his experience in West Karana and was a little worried about going there but had grown a bit since then so headed West to try his had with the Crag Spiders of East Karana.    <br><br>Passing through the Kithicor forest Tad camped until daylight when it was far safer to venture through the forest.  During the night the forest was crawling with vicious un-dead even the wisest old Ranger would do his best to avoid.  By 8 am the forest seemed safe and Tad sprinted to the other side, stopping for nothing.   Those damn Bixies made even this brief trip an unpleasant one.  Like large mosquitos the Bixies would chase Tad the whole way stinging him if he stopped to catch his breath.   <br><br>Safely on the west side of the Kithicor forest Tad was now faced with finding his way through High Pass Hold, know to be inhabited by those barbaric Orcs Tad had first encountered in the Desert of Ro.   The rocky passageway of High Pass cut through the high mountains region of Antonica.   A small maze of winding passageways, there were some areas in the center offering the safety of the local guards.   Once you got beyond the Guards you found the most western side inhabited by more of those despicable Gnolls!  These Gnolls were the big brothers of the Gnolls of Blackburrow and Tad would use his camouflage to get by them!   <br><br>Safely on the other side of High Pass Tad enters the long winding canyon of East Karana.   The winding pathway follows the ledge of the canyon wall with no way up and a long lethal drop down to the bottom should you loose your balance.   Only a few trees and a couple of abandon guard towers were the sites to be seen on this long winding path that seemed to go no were.    <br><br>After what seemed an eternity Tad slowly finds his way down to the base of the canyon as it opened to the hilly plains of East Karana.  Tad found lots of good hunting here as well as danger.   Magical Griffons fly freely around East Karana as well as the occasional Evil Eye and its pet.   More Hill giants, much to powerful for Tad but easy to see and hear to stay out of there way as well as a few Cyclops.   The Gorge Hounds prove to be good hunting experience for tad but the Crag Spiders Fufnski spoke of have to strong of a venom for Tad so he sticks to the Carrion Spiders and begins collecting spider silk and the occasional Hafling Parts.... hummmm.... Tad had never eaten Hafling!?    <br><br>Tad spent a lot of time at the mouth of the gorge of King Xorbb, this proved to be a good safe location to pull the Gorge Hounds.   After a few seasons of hunting Gorge Hounds Tads curiosity almost got the best of him.   Tad attempted one of the Crag spiders again and soon found two more after him.  A quick dash up the gorge and Tad was safe again as well as a little wiser!   <br></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

This became unbearable and Tad set out to do some more exploring.   <br><br>The West Common-lands were new to Tad and had many vendor huts scattered about as well as a Druid Ring to get a port to other locations.   The Commonlands seemed pretty safe as long as you stuck to the path as there were a guards posted along the main portion of the path.   Making his way to a small lake in the West Common-lands Tad spent an afternoon killing the Piranhas there.   No real great loot on the Piranhas but good experience for Tad and the Fish meat as well as the occasional Fish Scales were always a good source of food and cash from casters in the area.    Tad was resting on the shore when he noticed some one running around the bank of the lake.   Tad paid no mind to the passer by and continued to sit and rest.   A few seconds latter Tad had been attacked by this fellow, named Kizdean Gix a viscous Dark Elf that would wander the area attacking anyone in site that may consider him.     Gix new some great magic and soon wiped the floor with Tad.    Kizdean Gix was way tougher then anyone would consider him so take heed.  Waking up in his new home Tad would get no break from the guards of Freeport and though all in fun he took their comments to heart.  One day I will get even with Kizdean Gix!!!   His days are numbered; mark my words, Tad yells at the guards!<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

Tad seeks the help of a local Druid to teleport him to this city in order to avoid the dangerous expanse of mountains and plains in route.   With a friendly wave Tad is ported to his new home of Freeport!    <br><br>Freeport is a grand city filled with anything Tad could need, or so it seems.    Tad begins to study the lay out of the city to better find his way around as well as some of the surrounding areas.   Being a teenager now Tad could venture out from this city with little risk.  Crossing into the East Common Lands Tad finds a large tunnel in the south rock wall face.  It seems that many travelers set up at this mouth of the tunnel and auction off goods that they had acquired during their adventures.  Following this tunnel Tad also found a small group of vendors inside with many basic items and some fine steel weapons at inflated prices.  The other end of the tunnel took Tad to the Northern costal Desert of Ro.  <br><br>The Northern Desert of Ro was a good place for Tad to improve his fighting skill, though it could be vary dangerous most of those dangers were spread out and easy to see coming.  There were always plenty of adventures just like Tad in the Desert so there was plenty of help around if needed.   Tad also found others wanting to work as a group to more safely improve their skills.  Working his way down the cost line killing Desert Tarantula and Dune Tarantula Tad crossed over into the Oasis of Marr.   <br><br>The Oasis of Marr was an extension of the Desert of Ro with the added danger of a large lake with an island in the center containing a Temple with high level Specters.  The Oasis was crawling with Orcs, a barbaric race of small-brained muscle bound warriors with a mix of Shawmen running about.  These Ogre like creatures reminded Tad of his bad experience in West Karana so Tad was hesitant to test these Orc warriors too much.   Though he found that he could handle them one at a time, if he could rest between fights.  You have to be very careful with these Orcs, as they WILL help one another when in trouble.  The Orcs proved to be well armed and almost always carrying plenty of loot.   <br><br>&amp;#8220;SG to dock!&amp;#8221;  What is an SG?   Boom.... Boom.... Boom.... What the...   Its a mountain!?    SG, Tad found out, means Sand Giant and that was an understatement!   Much like the Hill Giants of the Karanas the SGs are very large high-level killing machines not to be bothered by the likes of Tad.  Tad quickly throws on his camouflage and quietly makes his exit to another area of the Oasis.   <br><br>The Oasis was crawling with Crocodiles and Caiman.  These large scaly lizards were tough fighters but did not gang up on you like the Orcs would.  The crocks did not have any real good loot but the meet was good for cooking and by now Tad could do wonders with a little piece of meet!  It seemed these Crocs would keep Tad busy for a few years, at least.  Of no real surprise Tad also found more of the un-dead in this desert area.  The average Zombie, Shriveled Mummy, Crypt Mummy, a Ghoul and a Dry Bone Skeleton could be found wondering the desert and proved to be pretty dangerous for a teenager as most tend to use magic.  Tad stayed close to the Dock were there were always people willing to help a lowly Half Elf out of trouble.  The occasional Desert Madman could be found wondering as well, and they were pretty nasty to casting magic on the unsuspecting passer by.  <br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

Hey wait a minute theres a tunnel at the bottom!   Tad had found one of many entrances to the dark underworld of Norath.  This was the home to the Dark races Tad had heard tales about but never seen.   They are so disgusting and despicable that they make there way around in the sewers of the city, hated by the guards they must be careful where they show there faces.  Being the curious teen he was Tad decided to explore this new world.  Dark and dank Tad wondered how anyone could call this home....then remembering he lived in a cave!?   At least he didnt have sewage running threw his living space!  A large labyrinth of winding tunnels and flowing filth, Tad made his way slowly peeking around each corner not to walk into some unfriendly type.  Filled with Beggars and Thieves Tad felt there was nothing worth noting down here.   Then Tad noticed a large room with a hallway on the other side.  Lining the hallway there were a couple of nooks on each side with something standing in each nook.   The supper Elf he was Tad decided to simply run past them to the other side and make his way around the corner.   And hes off.....  So far so good, none of these ghoul looking thing are following him.  Tad rounds the corner and POW!  You have been punched for 300 damage!  POW!    Tad wakes up back and home....DOUH!    Another quick trip to the sewer and Tad manages to find is stuff and head back out.   Then he comes across some gelatinous skeleton looking thing named Cuburt and Cuburt dosent like Tad.   I guess Mr. Cosby should have warned jello not to pick on someone bigger then it!  With nothing left but a pile of jello and bone chips and.....whats this?  A dress!?  Thinking it might be something important Tad kept the dress and began asking question around Qeynos.  He soon learned of Lucie Elron, the missing daughter or one of the Guards of Qeynos.  Tad returned the dress to Guard Elron and was reward with a Golden Locket said to contain the magic of added Courage!   He humbly accepted the reward giving his condolences and then set out for a new adventure.  <br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed May 28 04:05:30 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

Following along the North wall of the wooded mountains can seem more safe with the trees acting as cover but there are many nasty creatures as well as Bandits living in those mountains so dont be fooled.   There are a few Huts with vendors on the Northwest corner that will buy and sell to most.    Along the South side of the plane is a river running east and west.  There is a small fishing village on the Southwest end of the river again with many vendors willing to buy and sell to most people, even Half Elves.   There were a few isolated Guard Towers scattered across the planes but they are so remote they are of little help unless you find yourself within sight when you need help.   Tads first experience with this area was to stay on the path, as not to get lost.   He found plenty of your average Wolf, Bear and Lion to hunt on the planes but was looking for something else.  Ouch!..what the &amp;$@# was that?   Bitten by another resident of the planes, the Swarmling, Tad soon found himself doing battle with a small army of the little critters.   Tad fought courageously but to no avail, he awoke sometime later back at home trying to remember where he had been!?   After a short recuperation Tad cautiously started back to the Guard Tower to look for his belongings.  Sticking to the trail was the best part of this bad idea.  After a speedy recovery Tad paid a visit to the Fishing village.  He found nothing to exciting, and not really interested in fishing Tad decided to head for the mountains and see what they had in store.   Passing Brother Estle Tad remembered to give thanks to Karana for this wonderful land.   Along the mountain line Tad found the a few huts with some more vendors and a really nice sewing kit with 10 slots. Verrrrry hard to come by as they are no longer sold.  Tad snatched the sewing kit up and headed out to follow the Mountain range.  About an hour later and completely lost Tad starts to worry, and worry he should, there was an Oger camp near by and Ogres dont like people let alone Half Elves!   Next thing he knows Tad is waking up back at home again.. What happened!?  An Ogre had left quite an impression on Tad....literally, it looked like the Ogre had used a club on his head!  Now Tad started to panic.   Where had he been?  Lost and without getting a fix on his location before being jumped, Tad was in real trouble!  Trying to retrace his steps, with out repeating the beating, Tad searchs for hours with no luck.  Having found the general area he thought he had last been Tad cried out for help.   To his relief Tads prayer was answered by a dark stranger and his friends.   But could Tad trust this dark man and his cohorts not to make off with his belongings once they found them.  Tad gave his consent to the stranger and then prayed once again to Karana.   Here you are little one, said the dark stranger.  He had not only found Tads belongings but was able to bring Tad safely to them.  Still lost, the strangers was kind enough to guide Tad back to the trail so he could find his way safely home.....and home he did RUN. <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed May 28 03:48:00 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

This vast expanse was full of opportunity for experience as well as some of Tads first taste or REAL money...GOLD!   Starting off killing the spiderlings and bear for there meat, skins and silk Tad quickly became a pretty good tailor as well as an outdoor chief.  The spiderlings, though no real match for Tad, provided silk that was wanted by many vendors in the area and proved a virtual gold mine.   Now on the other hand the wooly spiders proved more of a match for Tad and contained even more silk!    The tundra was a vast expanse and there were few inhabitants but there were a few well placed guards on the outskirts as well as a vendor, Starn Bearjumper,  located in some ruins on the northwest end.  Now and then you could spot one of the local inhabitance, Tundra Jack and his faithful Polar bear, Iceberg, wandering the tundra.   The Woolly Mammoths and their Calves were plentiful as well as a great source for Meat, Hides and Tusks, which could be cashed in for Gold and Platinum.  Tad had never earned a Platinum piece before!   There were more of those nasty un-dead skeletons that Tad had first meet up with in Qeynos Hills but these were much more powerful being magic casting Skeletons.   There were also powerful Orc Shawmen all on the eastern side, Tad new better then to wander across the river!  After learning his way around the frozen tundra Tad decided to take a shot at the big game, Mammoth Calfs!  These little Mammoths packed quite a punch and could move much faster then Tad would have ever thought possible.  The Mammoth Calfs proved a good experience for Tad until the day he was kiting one with his bow and crossed paths with the mother!  That was a bad day for Tad, the little Half Elf was no match for the full-grown Mammoths yet.  Fortunately for Tad along came Tundra Jack and Iceberg and they took care of the mommy Mammoth for Tad.  Thankful to Tundra Jack, Tad had no way of knowing that he would learn to hate this savior of his one day. Growing weary of his frost bitten toes and lugging those heavy skins and tusks around, Tad decided to move onto the open plains of the Karanas!<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

The wandering skeletons of Qeynos Hills prove no match for Tad.  Becoming board tracking these lowly un-dead Tad decides to venture back to the un-dead ruins between the caves of Blackburrow and the safety of his home in Surefall Glades.    It is said that there are always plenty of these un-dead to be vanquished from the hills and some even carry the rare Putrid Rib Bone Tad heard about in the local Pub while exchanging the Moonstones he received from Guard Capitan Tillin.  Tad learned quickly that these magic casting skeletons do not like anyone coming close to the ruins.   By the time Tad was able to see these Putrid Skeletons were to tough to fight with yet, it was too late.  As if one wasnt bad enough running from 3 was no picnic!  Thank Karana for the short run back to the Guards even though they made fun of Tad every time he came running home now!  Teenagers should know better!?   It would be a few more years before Tad could go back and beat the bone chips out of those Putrid Skeletons but he did.  The great reward of the 3 putrid rib bones turned out to be not so good as Tad was not human enough to make the headband worth his while.  This was simply another good learning experience!<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed May 28 03:19:50 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Tadwenai <br>Half Elf <br>Pathfinder<br>Xegony<br><br>Master Baker (198), Master Brewer (248 - Trophy), Master Bait'er?

Tad is excited to practice his new skill, magic, and put these new spells to good use on the foul, dog faced Gnolls!  Though danger lurks around every corner in the caves of Blackburrow it is filled with fellow wanderers taking no pity on this pathetic race.   The guardsmen of Blackburrow soon learn of Tad and make his time in Blackburrow as unpleasant as possible.   Fortunately Tads new spells work rather well on the Gnolls and save his skin many times, though being hit by a train of Guardsmen heading for the zone its every Elf for himself and many will die!    Soon Tad learns that there is a use for Gnolls, dead Gnolls that is, the fangs can be taken to Qeynos and given to Guard Capitan Tillin there, another Gnoll hater, and in return Tad earns his trust and some Moonstones.  It seems Capitan Tillin also has a dislike for Gnasher as well and would reward Tad very well for Gnashers head, some day!  Though Tad has no use for Moonstones, as he can see in the dark, he soon finds a local Pub owner, Mcneal Jocub at Fishs Ale, which will give Tad Blackburrow Stout for his Moonstones! Hiccup!  Not only are the Gnoll fangs useful but also Tad uses the Gnoll skins to start a new trade....

A few more steps and Tad would be going home a little closer to getting that new bow.  BOOM!   POW!   BOP!  Tad had been hit by something!!??  It was a GNOLL!    A Gnoll named Gnasher Furgutt the guards told Tad, as he tended to his wounds.  Gnasher is known too well by one of our locals the guards told Tad.
