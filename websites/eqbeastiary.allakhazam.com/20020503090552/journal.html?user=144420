	   <tr><td colspan=2>Kaesora such a lovely spooky place)!. After it killed me in my Loc plz post and almost killed me and kelvena on&nbsp;&nbsp;a scouting mission, I had to go back. I was helping Lumien quest some ancient coins in kunark for some bardy quest we first went ter Dalnir (another spooky place) we didnt have toom any probs getting his coin outa therre since evrythinng was alive and didnt see us invising around. We then went to Kaesora for his next coin and some exp wherre i found that bardlulsong is great for avoiding encounters you can walk past them and they are Soo sads they dont even care). Anyways we killed and lulled deep into Kaesora heading towards the library to get his last coin. on the steps of the library i stood smiling waiting for him to come out and bring a couple of mobs (including his cryptreaver) with him. I got a sudden shock as he came out with a crowd of adds i tried to evac but he died just as i started to finish casting and they whomped me as well. then we had fun cring our bodies with a naked bard and wiz hehe. Well I ended up staying in Kaesora for several days.Kelvena also got slightly lost when i took the rest of the group elsewhere without really informing her and died then i died cring her corpse when a live ravener saw me and (us being the only evacers which you really need ter leave Kaesora) thus led to a painful cr and a annoying recovery of the tank. Someday later we finally get a full group together. Me (suicidal nutcase wiz) Fazyen (Master of pet related group suicide) sondilla...(er skip[ that this night she was wisely pling her rogue shandil) Artak (My favorite pulling cannonfodder singer of sick songs) Llumien (cheerful bard upbeat with quik sword song and feet) Lodbob (a necro from the guild who joined us that night) and Kelvena ( an Optimistic druid that unbeknownst to her had just entered a dimension we call the hEiSzOnE (soundeffects)), also one of me fav healers buffers and dealers of sowdamageetc hehe . We move down west of the the zone ent clearing spectral guardians lizskelmonks and other unded. oops backtrack before we got a full group me artak and kelvena were pulling odds and ends and artak had a bad pull thinking fast i nuked the one that aggroed on me and finally after being interrupted several times cast evac.....er gate noooooo(. Leaving my companions to die(/grovel. I went down and cred immmediately before respawn feeling incredibly stupid(hmm hope its not genetics). this was obviously forshadowing to the rest of the night. flashforward So we move forward clearing the first rooms. Artak pulls re have a wander attack while he is pulling suddenly the necro is dead Artak then drops and the rest of the group minus llumien follows suit.(llumien hadnt showed yet) lucky dog. We re cover bodies while fightin in a hot zone and then try to figger out how we got killed?. hmm evryone is talkn bout some named fearing them. Kel checks tracking and lo and behold therre is a named Reaverr of xalgoz near by hmm i check muse map hey he is in the room artak pulled. We gear up buff up and get ready to show this ghostly dork some manners when llumien shows up (/cheer). We move down pulling unded one by one till therre is only the reaver and one friend. Artak pulls and we give him a old fashioned welcome into the netherrealms while putting numerous feet into his nether region). He drops nada (note to reader if i dont mention any loot thats cause there wasnt any loot)). We move on to the library clearing all kindsa unded with one or two drops of interest(grats Llumien) that is the funny part a nodrop stats raising shoulderslot and llum and artak discussing who should get it tho both of them are trying to be genrous to the other). We move on killing names and non in the hut and elsewhere moving back towards the frenzied area Got some cool screen shots of us by the librarby with broketail the lizard statue. <br>Lol sometime round then Artak starts doing his joe peshi goodfellas imppression in response to lodbob saying we are fun spooking him lol. So we now have spotted Xalgoz on track (/drool) he is the master of the whole area hey we gotta try to kill him). Kel starts buffing evry9onne in preparationn for magic spells and poison etc. getting antsy and figgering we will be fine pulling the three little spiders in frenzied, i urge artak to get them hmmm 4 show up(. Suddenly they decide the healing no mana druid should be lunch nothin we can do they take her down to a bub and all of them get a piece before we can kill them all (overconned suckers). I start bandaging llumien who is below a bub and is poisoned rather nicely fazzyen joins in. I then feeling guilty go forth and get naked kelvena( you would think getting a naked female woodelf wouldnt involve guilt?). We trudge on killing spiders and wormtaiiled raveners going deeper into the ground towards Xalgoz. We itued and eyeof Zommed the whole area and after careful discussion pulled the area around the church pice by piece. Then we cleared the outside and the front area of the church. It was then that i looked outside and realised that sun was showing /gasp. We buffed up and armored pulled xalgoz and company to the front of the church to battle. We killed him (he dropped only the fangs artak toook one i took the other for the future charaisis key). /cheer /sleepdeprived smiles We took screen shots in the Xalgoz church hottub er podium (hey it looks like a hottub). Being sleepy we hung areound insid the church and pulled into it (note to self when therre is a place with seven or so spawns dont stay therre and make friendlies). We died when they respawned and we had pulled 5 or so more. loding plzwaioot..... <br>Hmm naked peeps evrywhere OMG!!!( what were we (I) thinking this is the CR from heeeeeellll( and it is daylight outside. OK deeeep breath calm thoughts how are we gonna do this?. We gear up the necro trys to summon corpse (he is a yellow away from the real summon corpse) it is only good for 35 or underr hmmmm. ok we gear up and move in llumien goes ld round then ( i hope he is on tonnight i hate to leave his body sdomewherre like that(). slowly painstakely we get close enuff to make a run forr the corpses. Artak btw has switched to torad his itu casting fully armored 35resing pally to help out moreso. We pull corpses out and res them one by one. At the sazme time wandering mobs keep showing up to drain our limited mmana further. finallly in a bad situation we vac out with kelvena's corpse stilll therre un ressed and artaks corpse down there.( fazzy logs the nec logs. we move back in getting into a bad sit and vaccing out (oooh yes hehe i had evyone lev and move acroos this pit to a lower level warning them to follow me and not too fall all the way to the bottom or they would die. We got jumped on the other side, at the same time kelvena didnt make it acros the pit and started floating to the bottom and certain death) we dropped the spider and barely vacced her out in time)).So we move back in and work down to kelvena to get her ressed and to artak corpse so i can pull it to the top. moving up slowly dealioong with mobs and lds we get to the last low area before we climb outa this place and drop to the ent(yes kaesora is very confusing). /Curses Our route out is blocked by a spider and his ravener buddy. Torad pulls we fight oops make that twoo ravener buddys ...( vac out. Ok this place is pissing me off now my friends body is down there i have killed evryone (again) and it is 930 in the morning????? OMG.

And low and behold when I try and log in after the second LD I found out my ISP is down.  WTF I bought a cable modem so i wouldn't get LDs doh.  I franticly try and make the cable modem work but to no avail:(  I panic!  HOW THE HELL AM I GUNNA GET MY CORPSE WITHOUT THE GROUP! AAAHHH!  I also wanna help everyone get their corpse:( OK sleep I have nothing i can do tonight that will help not even staring at the monitor.  I wake up and log on thinking I gunna have to be one super ass lucky bard and lull everything up to the church lol.  Thankfully I turn around and a 60 rogue is staring at me.  Well he helps get corpse.  I die again but he gets the good corpse with all my stuff so I'm still happy.  I try to pay him but all he wants is some food and water so i happily oblige him.  Kelvena is on and she assures me that everyone got their corpse, but only after a lengthy ordeal, only wish I coulda helped.  Well I gotta camp I'm tired and I need to get rdy for work.  Overall was a nice experience and I got my coin(thanks everyone).  Now City of Mist here we come:)  Come on guys its the last coin we can do it, hehe.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Kaesora such a lovely spooky place)!. After it killed me in my Loc plz post and almost killed me and kelvena on&nbsp;&nbsp;a scouting mission, I had to go back. I was helping Lumien quest some ancient coins in kunark for some bardy quest we first went ter Dalnir (another spooky place) we didnt have toom any probs getting his coin outa therre since evrythinng was  alive and didnt see us invising around. We then went to Kaesora for his next coin and some exp wherre i found that bardlulsong is great for avoiding encounters you can walk past them and they are Soo sads they dont even care). Anyways we killed and lulled deep into Kaesora heading towards the library to get his last coin. on the steps of the library i stood smiling waiting for him to come out and bring a couple of mobs (including his cryptreaver) with him. I got a sudden shock as he came out with a crowd of adds i tried to evac but he died just as i started to finish casting and they whomped  me as well. then we had fun cring our bodies with a naked bard and wiz hehe. Well I ended up staying in Kaesora for several days.Kelvena also got slightly lost when i took the rest of the group elsewhere without really informing her and  died then i died cring her corpse when a live ravener saw me and (us being the only evacers which you really need ter leave Kaesora) thus led to a painful cr and a annoying recovery of the tank. Someday later  we finally get a full group together. Me (suicidal nutcase wiz) Fazyen (Master of pet related group suicide) sondilla...(er skip[ that this night she was wisely pling her rogue shandil) Artak (My favorite pulling cannonfodder singer of sick songs) Llumien (cheerful bard upbeat with quik sword song and feet) Lodbob (a necro from the guild who joined us that night) and Kelvena ( an Optimistic druid that unbeknownst to her had just entered a dimension we call the hEiSzOnE (soundeffects)), also one of me fav healers buffers and dealers of sowdamageetc hehe . We move down west of the the zone ent clearing spectral guardians  lizskelmonks and other unded. oops backtrack before we got a full group me artak and kelvena were pulling odds and ends and artak had a bad pull thinking fast i nuked the one that aggroed on me and finally after being  interrupted several times cast evac.....er gate noooooo(. Leaving my companions to die(/grovel. I went down and cred immmediately before respawn feeling incredibly stupid(hmm hope its not genetics).  this was obviously forshadowing to the rest of the night. flashforward So we move forward clearing the first rooms. Artak pulls re have a wander attack while he is pulling suddenly the necro is dead Artak then drops and the rest of the group minus llumien follows suit.(llumien hadnt  showed yet) lucky dog. We re cover bodies while fightin in a hot zone and then try to figger out how we got killed?. hmm evryone is talkn bout some named fearing them. Kel checks  tracking and lo and behold therre is a named Reaverr of xalgoz near by hmm i check muse map hey he is in the room artak pulled. We gear up buff up and get ready to show this ghostly dork some manners when llumien shows up (/cheer). We move down pulling unded one by one till therre is only the reaver and one friend. Artak pulls and we give him a old fashioned  welcome into the netherrealms while putting numerous feet into his nether region). He drops nada (note to reader if i dont mention any loot thats cause there wasnt any loot)). We move on to the library clearing all kindsa unded with one or two drops of interest(grats Llumien) that is the funny part a nodrop stats raising shoulderslot and llum and artak discussing who should get it tho both of them are trying to be genrous to the other). We move on killing names and non in the hut and elsewhere moving back towards the frenzied area Got some cool screen shots of us by the librarby with broketail the lizard statue.<br>Lol sometime round then Artak starts doing his joe peshi goodfellas imppression in response to lodbob saying we are fun spooking him lol. So we  now have spotted Xalgoz on track (/drool) he is the master of the whole area hey we gotta try to kill him). Kel starts buffing evry9onne in preparationn for magic spells and poison  etc. getting antsy and figgering we will be fine pulling the three little spiders in frenzied, i urge artak to  get them hmmm 4 show up(. Suddenly they decide the healing no mana druid should be lunch nothin we can do they take her down to a bub and all of them get a piece before we can kill them all (overconned suckers). I  start bandaging llumien who is below a bub and is poisoned rather nicely fazzyen joins in. I then feeling guilty go forth and get naked kelvena( you would think getting a naked female woodelf wouldnt involve guilt?). We trudge on killing spiders and wormtaiiled raveners going deeper into the ground towards Xalgoz. We itued and eyeof Zommed the whole area and after careful discussion pulled the area around the church pice by piece. Then we cleared the outside and the front area of the church. It was then that i looked outside and realised that sun was showing /gasp. We buffed up and armored pulled xalgoz and company to the front of the church to battle. We killed him (he dropped only the fangs artak toook one i took the other for the future charaisis key). /cheer /sleepdeprived smiles We took screen shots in the Xalgoz church hottub er podium (hey it looks like a hottub). Being sleepy we hung areound insid the church and pulled into it (note to self when therre is a place with seven or so spawns dont stay therre and make friendlies). We died when they respawned and we had pulled 5 or so more. loding plzwaioot.....<br> Hmm  naked peeps evrywhere OMG!!!( what were we (I) thinking this is the CR from heeeeeellll( and it is daylight outside. OK deeeep breath calm thoughts how are we gonna do this?. We gear up the necro trys to summon corpse (he is a yellow away from the real summon corpse) it is only good for 35 or underr hmmmm. ok we gear up and move in llumien goes ld round then ( i hope he is on tonnight i hate to leave his body sdomewherre like that(). slowly painstakely we get close enuff to make a run forr the corpses. Artak btw has switched to torad his itu casting fully armored 35resing pally to help out moreso. We pull corpses out and res them one by one. At the sazme time wandering mobs keep showing up to drain our limited mmana further. finallly in a bad situation we vac out with kelvena's corpse stilll therre un ressed and artaks corpse down there.( fazzy logs the nec logs. we move back in getting into a bad sit and vaccing out (oooh yes  hehe i had evyone lev and move acroos this pit to a lower level warning them to follow me and not too fall all the way to the bottom or they would die. We got jumped on the other side, at the same time kelvena didnt make it acros the pit and started floating to the bottom and certain death) we dropped the spider and barely vacced her out in time)).So we move back in and work down to kelvena to get her ressed and to artak corpse so i can pull it to the top. moving  up slowly dealioong with mobs and lds we get to the last low area before we climb outa this place and drop  to the ent(yes kaesora is very confusing). /Curses Our route out is blocked by a spider and his ravener buddy. Torad pulls we fight oops make that twoo ravener buddys ...( vac out. Ok this place is pissing me off now my friends body is down there i have killed evryone (again) and it is 930 in the morning????? OMG.  I have tor and kel buff me up i sow run to tors body eye of zom hmm thrre at the bottom maybe they can see invis maybe not a spider that can see invis a spectral that can and then i am home free. All i have tooo do is  drag his body past the spider and ravener s around a spirally broken trail along a cliff up a broken floored tunnel past a healer spider and spec up a ramp drop  down to anoth level and run out the zone home free.  hmmm that is simple ). 3.. 2.. 1..

I got mugged by his bros when he ran fazzy replied(. Damned we ask the pally next to us to res him sure no prob.

Some monk shows up running for the ent or pulling  a pack of kols close to the ent and we jump in to help him fazzys wounded naked butt zones back in and boom instant aggro whack he is dead(. On the bright side the pally was willing to res him so wasnt as bad of a loss as it coulda been but the old lessons are so quickly forgotten hehe.<br>Main zones are always a subject to cautious on when zoning into because there is no telling who or what is waiting there from the person before) somthin we all have encountered  over  the seasons i am sure <br> Well off to the hunt)!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Slow healer? Slow healer?&nbsp;&nbsp;You called me a slow healer!? True, I was in a coma due to boredom, but I still wasn't that slow healing.  Though it is kind of bad when the only two people that died in Droga, in an otherwise safe &quot;raid&quot; were in my group. Oh well, the chanter guy died before I could get a spell off (and I wasn't exactly paying much attention I'll admit now), and you just kind of went the same way.  But all got rezes, so all is good.  I don't even think we were in the low level group.  Not many people were higher than me I don't think.  That was before I lost my 42 level too...a few, but not that many. <br><br>Anyway I might not be on tonight (eek!) because for some reason my account is not working.  It keeps telling me I'm not subscribed, couldn't bill the account...blah blah blah.  Well, we have another account on the same credit card and it's working, so while is mine not working?  Anyway I email the billing department, and hopefully will get a response before too much longer, if not I'm going to call them.  Can't they get a 800 number?  For gawd's sake, making me pay to call customer service. That's pretty damn sad if you ask me. <br><br>Anyway I was looking up the stuff in The Scarlet Desert *drool*.  There are some very nice druidy armor there that I would love to get.  We have to go there asap. Hopefully I'll have some high rolling dice...<br>&nbsp;<br>Level 40 Druid<br>Morell-Thule</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First of all lemme post a few responses (skip these if yer just wanting to go the parts where i groupwipe)<br>Hey Kelin Faz Llum glad to see I aint just talking to myself here (worries about that being possible schizoid behavior). Grats on Torad fer being the first one of me nightly group mates on getting a percent res spell lol i feel wee are gonna need it with me being around). FYI kelin /autojoin heisfriend&nbsp;&nbsp;(otherwise known as the channel for those that cannot be sane, fear death but just dont recognise him when he is tapping their shoulder hehe). ooh yes and thanks verant for making the new channels new commmands hitsmode(cutrs down on battle spam) new reses (grin) and giving me crits ))))).<br>Now to the Post<br> Did I mention i joined a guild recently hehe was unexpected but was  just to make communication ezer on their raid of MM (prior to the new channels of course) they  had reses available (TG) and we had a heck of a tiem tryn ter take the piano room of mm (lag) Ae aggro etc. Anyways i had an interrestn time with them and then Aguildie ranger and guildie druid helped me get my eggs for the third shawl quest (if you are int or wis caster get one)(thanks Al and Phal). So i ended up staying in the guild they all seemed to be good peeps and most know what they are doing (refer to my ae post). Anyways they had a raid on droga posted sunday (/drool lots of gobbys to kill interesting map layout  not much for the loot but might be fun). So i rush over too join up with them had some ld issues caused me ter be late but i know the area been therre before tryn to get to the cheif rogus (mispelled) fer some warr based loot fer me friends and my war alt.<br>Anyways i drop thro the invis pit trap  from main ent and group with 3rd group which is the low end group(exp group). We proceed down into droga with a first group with plenty of 51s and 40 plus group and my group with one 41 and all others under 40 we had an ez time of it barring stopping for the various lds and late comers to gather up. one of the warrs in the midd group was talking about the great exp he was getting??. hmm my group was getting exp off of maybe 1 outa 30 of the blue gobbys we werre helping to slay??. any ways the boredom continued interrspaced with comments  about exp and getting redi to ding  from the one warr. /sigh no danger no loot no exp not even any good conversation. There wass a moment where i peeled off on of the adds on the pulls and we got to kill him and then one time where we got Major Adds and aes and spells were flying left and right and then the time close to rokgus where i died from a weird pathing, the fact that half the guildies were up on the top of a ledge, a slow heal (i think lag and boredom hadd put my healerr friend in a coma) and Murphy(all praise murphy) that werre exciteing but this was interspaced by FOUR hours of Boredom. Finally we get to the Cheif and clear that area and finally the cheif pops we kill him the warrs give his item to the bestielord since he is the one that can use it. Oh yes the otherr warr dinged to 46).so then they are planning their next raid he pipes up with lets have a 45 only raid lol wait a sec jerknuts  some lower and higher peeps pl you and you WANT to have a 45 plus raid now tooo funny<br>then a wizzie i know (and have written about) wanted us to kick into the guildkitty down at the bottom of droga &quot;sure here why dont you have the 30 gold 37 silver and the 35 copper i have gotten here )&quot; FYI the gobbys in droga usually drop at least one plat and gold and change so that should tell you how much i looted and how much  of the 300 plus gobbys we got exp credit for.) I wanted to  quit multiple times but  i felt i owed the two that helped me for several hours some time so i stuck it out bored feeling like a third wheel etcetc. and icing on the cake is that  I coulda have gone down there with some of me main groupmates  and owned the cheif ez /sigh. I still like the guildies (barring a few hehe) i will go on the next raid but the sec it gets lame i am GONE!!) (paid my debt hehe) Well anyways i guided me mates and some extras  to twilight thro fungus ()scarry place to run invis thro)  and we started killing the greens and blues  to try and pop the names to get the nice loot from them.Well after the &quot;raid&quot; I guess i was a little crazy pulling greens after we had some peeps log and wiped us all with a tons of green and blue elementals.( Part of the reason was we had one healer log and torad come on so we didnt have as much healing capabilities as before but (tg) torad was on and  he ressed the peeps that died so they got some of it back. Anyways we had someinterestn stuff drop[ and then i lded and had probs coming back. by the time i logged most of the  group had camped except Kelvena and Fazzy and they had finally had a named (Hydro) pop he dropped an nice int belt with nice resists on itwhich fazy kept hehe.<br>Lessons Learned<br>It is impossible to keep evryone happy in a raid exspecially if some like to walk the edge and others just wanna be part of the herd hehe).<br>Letting others know what kinda raid it is going to be i.e GOALS and what part they will play is important.<br>If others in a raid have valid issues then try to correct them as soon as possble dammit (i could be dead next week yer fixes wont matter then).<br>Spreading yer groups a bit so they all can get some action will keep them busy. if at all possible<br>we have channels now use them hehe example drogachannelleader color bright red only leader has voice all other logged on to hear him<br>Drogagroupleaders MA main healer groupleader logged into all have voices<br>Drogahealer only healers on channel separate hotkeyed macros all healers have targetting the other healers with assist that way if one needs help he can yell for help healing and the otherrs can jump in and keeps that battle spam off the main channels<br>Wolves are a good way to pull(trains) elementals hehe sorry Kelvena).<br>Dont let a bad situation and your reaction to it cause you to stop thinking.)<br>Well i am outa here all you adrenaline hounds and gloryseekers have fun)<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Fazyen here I just wanted to add one more thing about AE ing. If your a wizzard or even a Mage with a pet when soloing or even in a small group ,its not a good idea to AE unless you have a tank Ai warrior barbarion or the sort, with higher mobs even some smaller level mobs can hurt. The pet works pritty good but unless you are close to a zone to run when you AE a big mob with just your pet or the wizzy alone AEing your going to get agro and have to run your arse off to make it out if you get too many adds he he he. An example of this would be Guk {remember the froggys they live on adds} Fazyen SHOUTS RUN weve got 12 of them on us !!! LOL. One more thing running around in circles is a BAD idea in a dungen when you have already got three to six adds on the group, you will get more,I'll not mention any names but we have all done it at least once he he. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

He fded so torad took  the attacks from her. We bandaged him and then he jumped into the battle  before she killed the pally. Was too late Torad dropped(  she was casting and then monk almost dead so he fded  she jumped  fabi  and then jumped to me when i started to harvest to get enuff mana to nuke her once or twice. loading plz wait,.... grouptalk &quot;Bind running stay alive&quot; hit the zone to sewers.

	   <tr><td colspan=2> Thanks llum) fer complimenting me you earn a great prize!!!) the chance to go on me next adventure!!!! great loot!!! (nothing or junk) great exp !!!!(loss) and the free misplacing of yer corpse in some strange dangerous dark dank place far far from yer bind point)!!!)<br> OKies Well an unammed friend of mine wanted us ter join him in&nbsp;&nbsp;alittel guild adventure to get keys to Sebillis. Being Friends of course me and my pally mate Torad went with acroos kunark thro dark and dangerous places to Trakenon. There we grouped with his unammed guild and hunted for foragers and hunters (froggies red to a 37 but my fire spells stuck). The Guild seemed ter be the decent sort tryning to split loot and exp, getting the keys was a little slow and boring fer obvious reasons. Me and the pally were thinking of leaving and heading out on our own ter more interestn shores after i recalled that Seb was a  45ter 50 plus dungeon that we didn't need a key fer a while being 37 and 40 respectively.) But then keys droped fer all and since we had looted medallions as well felt we should stick it out with them. Next they took us off straight into the jungle and fog as two groups to head fer  the Emperor to turn in. At this point i was slightly nervous be cause of the slight lag everyone seemed ter have and SOmething i couldn't remember but that my subconscious was screaming about but they had dealt with  evrything fairly well so far and seemed ter know what they were doing so Off We Went...... lag caused us and me to lose evry one several times  creatures would aggro on us and have to ber dealt with and moveing thro the fog water hills and trees was a pain (my Subconcious is really going ape now but i tell it to shut up). Next thing you know  we go off traveling and after a while of running we lose the ranger who is guiding. Then i see  someone in front of me to follow and start chaseing them thro the fog after bout ten minutes i realise it is another lost ranger from the group and not only that half the party has followed me) after tryn to regroups peeps get aggros,  and start to run with sow to lose them, having a map and not wanting to die  ( was at one bub) I do so also get out of aggro range and bandage up. i can here on group talk peeps fighting and healing and almost dieng my frined torad runs past me and brings a froggie (red) into my face.  I had locced and knew which way ter head fer the emporor so i run that way tryn ter outdistance the frogg again turn in stuff and zone to lose aggro. I meet up with the ranger guide  and a druid  we head towards the rest of the groups back out away from the zone walls and then get attacked again. I try help the ranger who is hurt when Bam! after the druid says oom an iksar  &quot;somthin mean and unded&quot; starts to drop me past two bubbs again i run heading for the zone wall planning fer me cring and locing the whole way Bamm! i am dead. Oops i fergot to bind by the zone line) and guess what me friend Llum is dead also. We regroup grab some wings and  head for the closest druid port  so they can grab us if the cleric cannot res fer a while. I get ressed eventually and then alla of us regroup to grab Llumiens corpse which is stuck and res him there.<br>Again i am nervous (Noooo!!( Noooo!) we head off into the dank dark foggy hilly tree-filled swamp with eyes peering  and regorup near llum they res him Mean while Mobs start wandering past us and aggroing  more and more of them. It was like wandering mob central bubbs of life start dropping mana starts dropping and evryone (trying to keep evryone else alive) stays to fight. Suddenly the first person dies then like a collapseing dam bodies  all heading in the same direction start dropping.... loading plz wait i recall trying to save my pally friend with a spell when a large Dinosaur came up and devoured me).  now me and llum and torad are all in Frontier Mountains naked and looking stupid, both groups wiped except fer one sole survivor. My memory block collapses i recall reading in Muses suggestions of the zone way back when ( and it being confirmed by other  persons in the strat section) that going in the middle of Trak to hunt or wander was an insanely Dangerous thing to do (my Subconcious snickers &quot;I told you so&quot;). Well me and me friends  hunted naked in Nurga takeing turns on the kills and exp till  SOndilla our chanter (/cheer!!! Manajunkie) showed up to group with some of us  while we waited. 45 mins  to an hour or so i get ressed and llum gets ressed. Their cleric talks to me about joining their guild....... Not sure I want to join with  those that are as dangerous as me hehe. But then i think on alla bad forgetfull (and sometimes outright stupid decisions) I chose ter make causeing the demise of me own and tell him i have ter  think on it and talk to me guildless friends.<br>Then to help with all the ressing lose of mana i go to grab sondilla, and torad who hasn't been ressed yet. In route in FM I meet up with Kelvena (yeah sow and better ports stolen from us wizzies!!!)) We grab SOnd and tor and Southwind to Em jungle and zone into Trak. SOnd clars evryone we all  chat and say bye. Then a voice in my head says Hell with this lets go get that damned key!! . Me  and the rest of me mates prev named lev sow  buff up and take a deep breathe and charge off into... the side of the zone wall and stick to it like glue with me guiding in the front. we reach the Trak - no hope Tunnel and stop fer a sec, then head east and south again circle around some spectral keepers ruins ( I love you Muse!! hehe) and then sneak up on the  tunnel to the Emperor Ganaks Throne Room there a a bunch of ghostly figures outside most blue blocking our path and too close to not aggro. I am tired of this i start  to plan our attack on these unded Trak fiends i am tired of running, Kelvena (40 druid) hollers wait there is a red in those  ghosts and Torad concurrs. Hmm ok never mind revenge on Trak will have to wait( Torad ITU s alla us. Since I put us here i go into the dark place first hoping that only ded things are here and that ITU doesn't fail and that what ever happens I aint responble fer anyone's death. We sneak into a  downward tunnel and a dank Large throne room with a Glowing (red con indiff am itued) Ganak. we go into the farthest corner from him to avoid any aggro form him and thro walls. Torad Itu fails first  he cons is indiff still) we talk to him turn in medallions get keys (/cheer) I gate us outa there to Gfay). /Tell the guild cleric we got the keys and thanks.<br> Epilogue<br>That was very fun! next week gonna group with that guild again and help their  druid friend with his epic)!! (and will see how they operate hehe). After all one or two of the same kinda mistakes could be an oversight)  <br>FYI there were about 11 or so chars involved levels rangeing from 35 to 48<br><br>Lessons If you feel nervous maybe there is a reason<br>Trying to shepherd large groups in lag city is a pain<br>Mass Confusion and not evryone knowing the Plan can kill<br>I need a 90 exp resing cleric available to take the pain outa my  choices (and curiosity and stubbornness and Optimism and &quot;my friends will fill in the blanks&quot;).<br><br>My own medicine sucks.<br><br>If you like the extra edge that insider knowledge provides use it dammit!! and plz remember it ( or have a copy handy to refer to in times of need).<br><br>And when the @#%^ hits the fan loyalty is kinda nice ( reason i am looking to group with them again)<br>&nbsp;<br>dungeon/quest/mob that is listed as five levels higher than mine own Thinking) .....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This swim thing always seems to come up and bite me in the arse.&nbsp;&nbsp;First it was guk and keeping up with you guys switching inbetween ancient croc and tuk warriors and now its tryin to swim up those dang waterfalls.  So one day i decided to swim across iceclad ocean to get skill up and to get to the other side:)  I never drowned because of song but boy was that a long swim.  Well at least it got my swim past 100 skill.  Now i have skill 125 and still my friends have 180 skill and above in swimming.  Alas they look at me from atop the waterfall and laugh since my poor arms aren't skilled enough to get me up.  I might need to bring myself to swimming iceclad again(brr that water is cold) or just continually swimming into a wall.  I will conquer swimming you just wait and see:)  hehe be prepared to wait it might take awhile.<br>P.S. I love your journal Heis simply a wonderful addition to Allakhazam<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
