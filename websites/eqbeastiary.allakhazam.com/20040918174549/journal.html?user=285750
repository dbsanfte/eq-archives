Meh I will just tell you the highlights of the past few days. Partied in Crawlers Nest more, oh boy was that painful. We had this White Mage whom I will not say their name, but basically when the Fly's did an AoE she thought it would be cool to Curaga everyone. Then when she gets hate she starts taking a beatdown and decides to start Cure III'ing herself. I swear it was a very very long party.<br><br>Now a sad thing to say but I had my first sorta bad JP party, well I invited them. Basically we had a JP PLD who was doing the job right, a JP RDM also doing the job right. I will not comment on if I was or not I will just let the story go, my friend D a WHM, a THF and a DRK. No IMO I think the DRK wasn't wanting to SATA buddy with the THF and the THF was slow at SATA'ing cause there was too much hate going to other members. Anyhow mid way through resting the RDM tells me that the PLD said that they should head back to town because they will die here, the &quot;THF and WHM are bad&quot;. Being all understandable and stuff, I'm like ok, and allow them to leave. During this time D was catching what he could in conversation and saw what they were saying as well.<br><br>Now the thing is that I personally couldn't see what D was doing wrong, he wasn't curing as much as possible, because there wasn't a big enough hate buffer because of the lack of damage caused by the DRK and THF, so what he was doing was fine IMO. But they just left we escaped and the PLD ran out. Basically the party disbanded and left. I was still out the front when the PLD ran past me, Cure III'd me and I said See you Again (in the limited romanji that I know) trying to be a smartass cause I knew what he said, and I hoped that by saying this he'd figure out that we knew what he said. But in responce he was really polite. If I was to have something out for one of them it would have been him before the RDM. The RDM was open and honest with what he was going to do. I respect that. Anyhow enough of that.<br><br>So after that I go back in to help T get his Mold for Genkei 1. Two exo's in and we get defeated by about 30hp. We log and wait til the next day when D came back on to try again. 20hrs later we are there again, waiting. We pick up a level 41 (I think) mnk that only needed 200 off exp to level, and well we weren't getting the best exp but we could still help out. First Exo in T gets nailed for 600+ damage on a darkspore attack. We quickly escape (just) and work our way back down to raise and start again. While waiting we ask this RDM to help out and he agree's. Fastforward to the fighting... Going through attacking this Exo and I get colled with a 440ish hit from Darkspores leaving me with 18hp. I quickly bail to the side and heal myself. Fight is still going good, the RDM is taking most of the damage, well he would be if he wasn't using Phalanx. So what I want to know is if I survived a Darkspores attack and T didn't... does that make me a BLM44 better than a DRG50? :P Taru Powah!</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

Well 40BLM, got Combat Casters Cloak (CCC) and well just been farming and stuff.<br><br>I decided that I really should level my sub, being that I was BLM40/WHM19 (yes bad me, but I've been waiting to level 19 with our STPT that has meant to have started by now. Anyhow I jump onto WHM and get a party in well pretty much instantly when I walk into Quifim. So it starts off ok, then I arrive.. 3 members drop and I'm all like... err is it me.. turns out two were leaving but on had d/c. Few battles in the BLM d/c again &gt;_&lt;... When he turns back up again, it all turns out to be ok and stuff until.... <br><br>It was this rainy night, we were all camped on the top of the pond,&nbsp;&nbsp;Phantoms (or what ever they are there) had us pinned down. So we waited it out and decided to go after crabs when they went.  So the time comes and we all start back up again... I'm running low on MP so I decide to check the mob to see what it has left... OVER 75%!!! Then everyone starts yelling at the BLM to get his act into gear... no responce... then right near the first person's death, he's like... Sorry I have to leave.. then starts logging. Like OMFGWTFBBQn00b! He didn't even offer any help, like sure something important might have been up, but geez logging mid battle is really low...  3 mins help and it would have been over.<br><br>Anyhow long story short he logged, 3 of us died, and the party broke up. Now right around nwo I would have been mighty pissed, but seeing that I was leveling a job that was meant to be for the static, I didn't mind a death or two. So I heard back out to Qufim and wait abit... then my fav... a JP invite... yay... and off we were going to Sauromugue Champaign. A level 19 party in this area... I gotta love JP's for their ability to goto area's that are totally not the norm for leveling.<br><br>So I won't go into details, but I got about 1.25 levels during the party with them, and also took part in a 3xMB... how's that... a WHM taking part in a 3xMB and actually doing damage in them.. at such a low level ^^<br><br><br><br>Nhoj</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

The Crawlers Nest. See this might be an ok place to go, but ever since someone printed it in a guide or something like this, it's hard to go to this place without running into idiots. Now my parties this morning were not that bad, but they borderlined on decent. <br><br>So the story begins... with me entering the Crawlers Nest, running through a crowd of 20-30 people outside (great someone trained something). I get in to see about 20 crawlers of all sorts, and beatles as well... I'm not sure if these beatles aggro and didn't want to find out. So I start running back when I see the beatle get charmed and stop. Then the BST sends the beatle to it's death. All the Crawlers link to it and I quickly dash past.<br><br>So the party starts when I get there and exp is decent enough. After a while I notice that the crawlers have edged their way back to where we had camped and notified the others that they were coming back. But do you think that they listened.. They pulled another crawler back and you can guess what happened. Now at this stage I didn't know that they kinda came back for the rest of the party (I didn't think anyone did anything to them, but it was still enough for them to come after us).<br><br>We are sitting there thinking we were safe when all of a sudden all the crawlers come back. During a brief melee and my HP going down to &lt;20 we were escaping our way back outside. This was not the last time I would have to escape the whole party of parts of the surviving party members back outside. Now what I want to know is what sick and demented player thought that it would be fun to train all them back to the enterance. I know that when I reach a high enough level I'm coming back to these places and destroying all trains that I can see.. it's stupid to hold up leveling because of someones stupidity.<br><br>Now I leave the crawlers nest after that to do some quest/mission stuff. Not too far into it and Yul tells me about the Adventures of MegaMan. (I will come back and link to this when I write down what happened). After some quests, not to many I nearly have my Warp2 quest activated and some other misc quests done. I head back to Jeuno to see if I can get another party, and quess what... I got one... in Crawlers Nest &gt;_&lt;<br><br>But this one was different, XX was leader, being a person that I've partied with before on several occasions, I took up the offer and was soon off to CN to kill some crawlers... /joy again. After a few fights I realised that this party wasn't half bad, more like great. Even though exp was 100-150 it flowed which was all that mattered. Funniest thing about the party was that it consisted of party members from this morning and last night at the CN, which was fairly amusing.<br><br>I'm now 38 and halfway to 39. My mission is 40 by the end of the night.</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

So my first attempt brought nothing but silence... come on a level 36 Taru BLM wandering Jeuno... some nice JP party might need me... please... hrumptf... maybe not, so i pack up my fishing gear and take a trip to the local fishing hole in Qufim. Few moments later.... BING... JP party invite, and they actually said yes for a non-JP speaking taru ^^<br><br>Eldieme Necropolis was where we were off to this time. Again with the places that I've never leveled in. Now it started off slow having to get our camp, but once the action started Exp came at a nice rate.. about 3k and hour. For the next two hours (2am til 4am), a few things happened to me. <br><br>First off I broke my Magic Burst record... it's now set at 231.<br><br>Secord which should go with the first... Double Magic Bursting with the other BLM... kinda funny seeing something sit there while taking rwo 200+ magic attacks, and not going after you.<br><br>Third thing being that due to the time I think I played a few times on auto-pilot. I know that I was still playing because, well I just remember doing stuff... and seeing places I've never seen (which I've confirmed afterwards that I've been there). Not that I approve of this... actually I think that sleeping while you are in a party is a bad thing, but I was awake sortof and still functioning... stage.<br><br>Anyhow we all leveled and headed back to Jeuno since it was early in both Japan and Australia.<br><br>The next day i woke up at midday and decided to check some stuff.. Basically it all started again. I grabbed fishing pole and lure then went looking for Lv28 Fishing. After about 2 hours I finally got it... plus somehow I fished up a Black Sole, which is meant to be a lv80+ fish. Stuffs me how but I got one (no skill up off it though). So a quick warp back to Jeuno pick up another lure, then Glyph warp to Port Windurst, small fish for a catfish (which I ended up buying), and I have Novice Rank in fishing.<br><br>Next thing up was actually doing stuff with my life, so I took a few hours out to go shopping and crap.<br><br>When I finally returned to game, chucked flag up... and a few minutes later NA invite to Crawlers Nest... /joy ; ; -- I gave it a go and it wasn't that bad, ended up getting two JP guys later and the exp started flowing fairly well. Then all of a sudden our DRK just decides to play solo for some reason and leaves. This resulted in the party disbanding shortly after. So much for the Crawlers Nest. IMO the best places to party, and people to party with are those who have a clue and don't goto the area's that everyone swarms to.</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

While there Yul stumbled across the Chest and proceeded to kill the nearest Vot. looking for the key. Well it dropped first go, and what did we get from it... an Amethyst ; ; ~~ So we are hunting around looking for more Harvesting points and I manage to just take out (Priest, Theo and Vot) all in one go with my BLM. This guy that was watching asked if I was looking for keys. I replied that I wasn't but I could help if he wanted. And soon after he joined us and we started to help him out. After about 20 mins of farming Yag's down the bottom, Yul tells me that Vuu just spawned, and even though I wasn't full life/magic, I proceed to nuke him out of existance... and all we got was this lousy Circlet. Seeing that I can hardly use headgear and Yul said that she couldn't wear it we decided to pass it over to the guy that joined cause he as asking if he could have it. About 30 secs later this DRK pops up, must be lookig for Vuu, we tell him that he just got killed (but you know this tactic from camping Lizzy, nobody believes you when you're telling the truth). He then asks if anyone needs the key, we say yeah and he joins.<br><br>So we are are there for another 5 mins, and I'm basically still sitting there saying go into the other room, grab yag's from there. Nobody listens ; ; ~~ so I heal up and go forth to solo some yags, solo being alone but still in the party. I cast Areo II on one of the 3 that I find there, and think.. crap link. I start running back cause we had enough firepower to destroy them with ease. I turn around and there is only one there, so I start laying into it, and what drops... KEY ^^ ~~ Gutt feelings :) - We finish up there and part as more people come to camp Vuu, but why.. he doesn't have anything that important. We finish up harvesting and seeing that it's 3am and I have to be up at 7am to goto work I warp back and proceed to finish up and log.<br><br>The next night wasn't that eventful, but I did miss out on Vuu again, because I wasn't looking for him and I actually think that I ran straight past him &gt;_&lt; -- Fished up half a stack of Neb's, and killed two Phantom's for two Cloth pieces ; ; -- no Ice Spikes for me. Going to try later I think, been reading about him and it seems there's about a 1:40 chance or something, which kinda bites. Someone said it would be faster just making the 20k than to go out and hunt him, I think he's correct, but it's still nice to get a 20k item for free..</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

Well as you might have already read, I'm on my weekend of Gil making and buying all the splls that I have just happened not to get over the past 36 levels. So in brief, I started this weekend missing 11 spells, now I'm down to 6, these ones ain't too critical but I think I will just get them regardless.... and maybe spells for the next few levels up to 40.<br><br>So I've eaten about 60k worth of spells already and I have probably about that left to buy, and my broken rod is still on auction so I can't go fishing for Nebs. I got two stacks last night... Yum 28k :D I decided to go do some quests that were outstanding and start some, get some extra gil on the side while my stuff sold.<br><br>I remembered the Chocobo qust where there was a Mithra tending to a sick Chocobo so I started there... this one was an easy one, go out and get some Pap. Grass... yeah right, buy if from the AH for 100g,&nbsp;&nbsp;and get 1500 back for completing the quest. After that's finished I decide to complete the quests' next part, I lose about 300G after the reward for the next mission bcause I bought the shrooms from the AH but meh, one more quest I don't have to do later...<br><br>After completing that quest I had enough for the Test Results, Yay Aspir Scroll here I come. So after the Aspir qust I decide to take on the Scorpion Stinger quest, another 1500 when I finish it. And off I as headed to catch me some scorpion stinger thingy.  Found where they spawned and after about 30 mins I had the stinger. Now here is where the next few hours became fun and very profitable.<br><br>As I was leaving the Maze, I notice this bat attack this guy who was running to zone, so I try to cure him but he runs out of my range. I get to zone to find two dead bodies there. What a waste... ; ; ~~ I zone, and see one of thier team mates on the other side, I say sorry because I couldn't help them out, but still tried and then proceeded to rest. Then along came M. He has this knack of just turning up at the same place where I am unexpectedly.<br><br>He asks to tam up, him being a BST35 (last time I saw him, he was a BST10), and I was like sure. He was only coming here for the drops. So off we went and for the next few hours e killed Scorpions, Crawlers, Smiles, Bats, Goblins, Wendigo's you name it we killed it... well cept for Wight's cause we couldn't get that far. But in the nd I think we got about 10k worth of items, plus the Maze Key (/woo). So we headed back home cause we both needed to eat/make dinner.<br><br>Afterwards I decide to go hunt some lizards out on Meriphataud so I can complte the Warped Bow quest a few times while my scorpion claws and stuff sold. And lets just say that I'm still out here, and not one drop, though I've been solo'ing Axe Bear's without any drama's, though also I've had only one drop, so I can't call it too successful.</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

Oh boy fun indeed.<br><br>So you all prtty much know what had to be done for Summerfest so I won't go into every little detail for each item uo to Lord's Yukata, but I will fill you out on a happy story.<br><br>So I'm needing one last item to get the Lord's Yukata, and well veryon's shouting ever evrything but a Tarutaru Male... figures. So I finally get up the guts to ask some random Tarutaru Female (this sounds like a first date type thing doesn't it). Anyhow I kinda thought she would be Japanese, but she did know abit of english, probably more how to write key words.<br><br>She tells me that she can't understand english, but she's M's Friend (I will lave his name as M for safety reason's). Now I wouldn't say that M and I are the bestest buddies in the world, but I was in a few parties with him and have help him out on occasions and he to, for myslf. I would have to say one of the nicest Japanese players that I've ever met. Not I did a brief search for him and he wasn't online, or on in my friends list, so  how did she know of me, has M been talking about me in his LS ?<br><br>Wll anyhow turns out that she was going for her first piece where  I was going for my last. She was so happy when she got it, over the mood is probably an understatment, and she asked for a Photo.... awww how cute, so I posed for here, we then parted, two very happy campers.</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

I've officially passed my other characters highest level. I'd previously got Zangief to WAR35 in my ongoing mission to go to WAR75 with him, then well interest went out the window cause it was getting hard to find good a good party to level with. So yeah tonight I will drink much wine and get taru-dizzy-wizzy ^^<br><br>So the events went like this. I'm sitting around at the Jeuno AH, flag up waiting for another JP invite. 30 mins goes by and I finally get one, an invite that is. Seeing that this was the first one in 30 mins I decide to take it up and off to the Citadel I go, /joy. So I get there and the leader's like, you might have to act as WHM... I'm like.. crap :/ but I was following this WHM32 on chocobo to the Citadel as well. I'm about to tell him about the WHM when the WHM joins. Yay. The party ended up being half half NA/JP.<br><br>After a brief near death experience when a beatle popped in the middle of us while we were getting Invisibled to take the trip to our camp. We were off to the Door #1. By this stage the leader has asked me, &quot;Have I partied with you before?&quot;, I kinda remembered his name, and traced it back to a Maze of Shak. party. It's a small world. Anyhow, after about an hour or two of fighting beatles and bats, I'm 2k from leveling, and our WHM needs to leave. Why is it that levels mock me like this. All being nice and stuff we escape back to the enterance and start disbanding... I quickly use what limited romanji knowledge to say thankyou and goodbye to the Japanese players, then we all co our own ways. Yes I'm being a little JP-groupie and trying to earn kupo-points with as many JP's as possible, who knows I might get a random invite from one later on who remembered my name and picked me out of all the other people because of the good experiences they have had in the past.<br><br>Mithranspotting, such a fine sport to be doing while waiting for an invite... Nothing for another 30 mins. At this stage I'm going stir-crazy, I can't level cause BLM's get kicked going solo, I can't buy stuff cause I don't have enough Gil for spells, and I can't fish to level up fishing or make gil cause it's less than 25% waning moon ; ; ~~ I decide to try my luck at the Ice Pond in Qufim, go grab a 4k Shrimp Lure and I'm off.. If I snap this one first cast I'm going to be a heaps mad taru.<br><br>Few casts later I recieve 0.2 fishing skill up, something that I havn't got for a long time (skillup's that is), so forget the being mad if I break the rod, I'm getting skillups ^^ ~~ So another 30 mins and a few more skillups later I get a tell from someone wanting me in the Crawlers Nest. What is it with people and their Crawlers Nest &gt;_&lt; -- Anyhow I accept (only need 2k to level), and head off that way. Upon getting the invite I notice a few of the names, one being a JP I partied with last night, so I think to myself, this party is either ok, or that poor JP is stuck with leveling with NA's ; ;<br><br>Anyhow, a few team-mate deaths later, about 4 of us level around the same time and decide to call it a night. Escape out, bow and do my Groupie thing to the JP guy, then say thanks to everyone else and I'm warping back to Jeuno. During the events of the night, I had my friends in LS telling me to stop leveling and to get all the spells I'm missing. Yes I know I'm missing about 10 spells now, alot being aga's though, so I'm not worried, I'm more worried about the Water/Aero II that I'm missing. So with lvl 36 Ding'd, I think I will take a time out and do the following. Obtain Rank4+ (currently Rank2 ; ;), Get Aspir quest (yes I know ; ;), start the Warp II quest by doing the 2 prereq quests, fish up a storm and get most of the spells that I'm missing. That's going to be a good 100k I'm guessing ; ;</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

I get a japanese tell, respond in the usual way and then no responce... bum ; ; ~~~ A few secs later I get a tell from another Japanese party, and bingo I'm in. A few minutes later we are boarding the Kazham Airship. Where the hell are we going this time? I swear alternative leveling area's a-go-go!<br><br>While travelling on the airship a Hume and Taru decide to jump ship, I really need to know how to do this :P We finally get to Kazham and find out that we are heading for Norg. I think to myself, what is it about these Japanese parties and taking me to places that I've never been to before. I'm loving this. So we finally get to Norg, with little to no hassles, apart from the random dropping of a character here and there due to net issues. So we start fighting, first bits of experience weren't to crash hot, but then the Ghast's started popping 200 every now and again. This wasn't as good as the party in Altepa but better that last night's one as we had no downtime and could easily chain MOB's.<br><br>So I missed my first 3 MB's all because I swear the JP's were using slowtime.. First guy executed, then about 6 secs later second went. Now thinking that I was probably in lag, I counted 3, then hesitated, then just started casting thinking he was about to execute. Wrong ; ; ~~ Anyhow long story short, final worked out the timing for this group, strange and delayed as it was, I hit my highest MB damage tonight, 142 with Thunder.<br><br>Well after about an hour our SMN needs to leave and that well topples the part, leader bails back to Jeuno via Instant Warp, and the rest of us wonder around Norg just doing stuff. Good party while it lasted... went from 34.3 to 34.8, so close.... so close ; ; ~~ Anyhow I busted out the fishing gear to see if I could catch anything. It's funny where I was fishing in one or two places, I'm now fishing all over Vana'diel. Schultz's Fishing Tour 950 woo ^^<br><br>With nothing more to do I head back to Jeuno, and then catch a Teleport back to Mea to help Yul level BST. All I have to say is that BLM can do a hell of alot of damage to lover level MOB's. I couldn't farm too much cause I was required to help heal, but what I did get wasn't enough to say it was even remotely successful. Damn bee's not carrying a heap of chips ;P<br><br>That's my night up, hopefully I will get another JP party tomorrow night and hit 35 or 36 if I'm lucky.</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

Well where to start. Went Moat Carp fishing in Rabao for an hour.. used 4 stacks of Insect Paste to get one stack. Totally crap fishing tonight. So after that I decide that going back to Bastok isn't such a bad idea. I set off back to my HP which was in East Altepa, then try to find my way back to the tunnels. See I didn't have a map when I came here so my wrong turn into the ara where you go to gt to Quicksand Cavs was a very fatal, wrong turn.<br><br>A death later and Dal comes over to help me out of the place, we go into the tunnels and it's all going good until we hit a Gigas, or should I say it hit us. After sleeping it we continue on and I accidentally aggro a jelly... oops... we end up training it back to zone, but our morals are too high so we decide to stick it out and kill them, this resulted in my second death for the night. Damn Microsoft Keyboard and non-responcive CTRL keys.<br><br>So -1000exp later, I'm in Bastok and on my way to Garlaige Citadel, the joy of going to a place like the Citadel. On my way over there I see a WHM seeking, so it's a good sign, but atleast that's what I thought when I came here yesterday. So I get inside and there's a lvl 32 RNG lfp, so we team up and in 15 mins we have a full party, kinda bizarre but workable, 2BLM's, PLD, RNG, WHM, RDM.<br><br>Well won't go into the boring long details of the leveling there, but lest say I'm writing this, 800 from lvl34 and it's been about 2 hours now... 2 hours to get 4000 exp. That might not sound bad, but lets just say that in the same time I'd probably done 7-8000 in Altepa, and on top of that, there was little to no downtime.</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

There's been about 10 deaths in this party, none caused by me, more Bats linking and the occasion when a Beatle. But yeah I've managed to nearly come through without a death (touch wood). Exp is slow, well ofcourse..<br><br>OMG breaking news... I will never say stuff about not dying ever again. While resting up just now this Beatle poped at camp then proceeded to cause abit of havoc to our less than haled partie, and the PAL was nowhere to be seen. His character just standing there doing nothing. Luckily a high lvel RDM cam along to hlp us out. Dame PLD's *shakes fist*<br><br>And again we are faced with our exp grinding to a hault... why? an AFKPLD :/<br><br>So I'm now back in Jeuno and what a mess that was. We were fighting this bat, and another one pops behind us. It sat there for about a minute bfore it linked. Seeing that our MP reserves were low I decided to hit the killswitch and Escape the whole party. Oh boy did the leader not like that. My reasoning behind this was that people wanted to level soon, and waiting around for 5 mins until the raise-sickness wore off would have taken more tim than healing up outside and starting again.<br><br>Well he was saying that bats don't link, though the whole party was with my decision... yay, and telling them that they do and our tank was taking a beating from both of them. Anyhow that's enough for me for one night... 33.5-34.33 is pretty good considering the area and party. Tomorrow I'm hoping to pass Zangief's highest level of 35... wooo I hear you say... yeah right.</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>

So after an hour of getting nothing but a Dark Bass, I decide that since it's 7pm and I havn't leveled Schultz in a good few weeks or so (been leveling Zangief's RNG to 18), that I'll head off to the Citadel see what party wants a lvl 31 BLM. So off I head and a good 20 mins later I arrive at the Citadel.. 30ish people inside a handful around lvl32, things are looking good.<br><br>After about 5 mins I get this japanese tell... now I love partying with Japanese parties, not because you can get good experience off them, more that they are really nice people to play with, and they know what to do. So do a search for him and find that he's in Lower Jeuno... -_- ~~ I instantly think.. greeeeat back to Kaz and those damn jungles &gt;_&lt;. I reply with my standard auto-translated responce, which to this day I've never had a japanese party rejection, and the responce I get, &quot;we will wait for you in lower jeuno&quot;... sweet some english, atleast if I can't understand somethng vital he can try and tell me in english. So off I head... on foot to Jeuno from the Citadel... joy ^^<br><br>A goblin mage aggro later I'm waltzing through the gates of Jeuno. Once I get to the HP in Lower Jeuno we sit and wait for the last party member to be found. I decide to look around at my fellow party members and that is when I see our leaders rank... 10!! OMG I could sence that this would be a good party. After about another 10 mins we finally get our WHM. Now boys and girls this is where you must learn not to judge a book by its cover. The newest member to our party, our lvl28WHM (rest of us being 30-31) went by the name Galkan----. Instantly I'm like... galka -_-' ~~ few minutes later I get focus on him and wave. Then out of the jeuno fed model loading lag sprouts this rather large.. taru! Take five do a turn and call me george... O_o!<br><br>So off we go.. where we were going I was not sure as well the whole &quot;where are we going conversation was in Japanese&quot;. few secs later party is getting tele'd to Dem. Now I'm sitting there thinking.. what's in Dem or around Dem for level 30's. We arrive at Dem and I run out expecting everyone to get a chocobo, then our leader who had changed to WHM to tele us to where ever we were going starts busting out Tele-Altep... then stops and one of my party pokes me.. I'm like.. I don't have the Key for that tele.. that's when I'm then told by 2 members to follow them, they too also didn't have Keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;so off I go again chocobo'ing to the leveling area.. Altepa.. hang on where the hell is Altepa O_o!<br><br>So I'm following my team mates all the way back to Bastok, talking in Linkshell. Taxman, now joins LS with his new character Tax.. gee creative :P anyhow talking to him and he's bitching about how hard stuff is at low levels when there's no subjob and stuff like that... By this time I'm finally pulling up to Bastok and as I'm running in I see this lone ? on the horizon... TAX! ~~ As I run past I left off a /laugh and then continue on... a chuckle and a retaliative line of abuse later I'm laughing my way into Bastok Mines. I won't bore you on the details on getting to the desert through the tunnels as it was quite eventless.. and a piece of cake.<br><br>So we arrive at our camp, they had already started pulling the Beatles over and killing them by the time we got there, our leader had jumped over to Rabao and changed to SMN by the time we got there. So we start leveling as a party finally. 200+ exp flowed forth everywhere... OMG I was like a kid in a candy shop. Here I was expecting to get some mildly good party and maybe get to lvl 32 or 32.5, but by the end of the night, I'd finished up 33.5 plus I got the Crag Key for Altepa. I don't think I can say how much I love Japanese parties. They took me in knowing I couldn't speak a word, didn't have an issue with my nuking or any actions that I did over the course of our leveling period. Why can't I find more NA parties like this?<br><br>So I'm now in Rabao contemplating if I should go fishing again, or level.. If I can grab another party maybe the one from last night again, then I'll level, and oh boy will I level. :)</p>&nbsp;<br><b>Characters:</b> <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?2679 target=akztarg>Zangief</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?36653 target=akztarg>Schultz</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=285750 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Journal</a> - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal2.html?user=336929 target=akztarg>Lakshmi Forums</a></td></tr>
