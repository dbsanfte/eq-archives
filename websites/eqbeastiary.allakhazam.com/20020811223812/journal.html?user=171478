Half Elf Ranger

Mother is Human, a lady-in-waiting to a minor noblewoman. My Father is an Elven Ranger, who served the nobleman for a time. It was a time of war, and of arranged marraiges between the minor nobility. While my mother cared for her husband, she was drawn to this foreign warrior, and discretion was thrown to winds. Things could not continue of course, and when the current hostilities ceased, my Mother and Father parted, each to pursue their chosen ways of life.

The nobleman's Holding was near Elven Lands and there is much Elven blood in the Human population of the area. So my Elven features went  unremarked, and caused no gossip, when I was born 8 months after my Mother's Human husband returned from war.

When I reached adulthood, I had a chance encounter with a seeress. She saw the truth of my lineage, and the whereabouts of my Father were revealed to her, and to me. With my mother's blessing, but in secret as my true parentage must remain unrevealed, I journed many a long day to Surefall Glade. I made myself known to my father, and was accepted. It was he who instructed me in the ways of the Ranger.

And now I journey the lands of Norrath as a Ranger, like my Father.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Today I really did manage to stick to my plan to find the remaining ingredients for my pinescout armor. I hunted willowwisps for experience, and giant field rats for whiskers. The wisps were dropping Lightstones like crazy, and I soon had four.<br><br>I also got myself killed by Gnasher Furgutt, and unexpectly, he was helped by the two guards by the shop in Hills, Yalroen and Sironan. This confused me greatly, since my faction with the Qeynos guards is excellent. But although I have run by them often before, and shopped there numerous times, this time they informed me they hated Rangers, and promptly slashed me into oblivian. Oh well. At least this corpse was easy to retrieve.<br><br>I killed the poacher Yollis again, and it was truely an even battle. Wthout my spells, he would have had me for sure. I decided it was time to give away those ruined leather leggings, and I found myself a L4 Human Druid, Thelous. I told him about the quest, and he was very excited to get started. With the leggings in hand, we headed to Surefall, and he gathered the info he needed to create the pinescout druid leggings. <br><br>I offered to assist him in gathering the needed supplies, and we set off. The pickings were slim, but we eventually were able to pick up the bat and rat furs he needed. I can't wait to get a better heal spell, since keeping him alive took most of my manna a time or two. But it was rewarding to get a chance to play mentor for a change, and I gave him supplies and a Lightstone to further assist him. If I run in to him again, we will go and hunt the spiderlings needed for the thread.<br><br>I also traded my stack of bone chips for ruined cat and bear pelts. After I got back to town, I successfully created a patchwork tunic, and with my brewing skill, made stormguard rootbeer,&nbsp;&nbsp;bog juice and berry juice. I tried my hand at Ginesh and Kalish, but to no avail. My try at baking rendered some clumps of dough and rat meat sandwiches, but the giant rat ear pie didn't go so well.<br><br>Another day is ended.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Another attempt to complete the pine scout quest and yet another zig in the path. <br><br>Once again I joined Troilen for some hunting in Blackburrow. And right off the bat, I got myself killed on the way to the Elite room. I tried to run away, tried to swim away, tried to climb the ladder away, all to no avail. There I was, floating above my corpse, lying on the bottom of the lake. Troilen loved it, but I least I didn't drown, really, I got bashed to death by two swimming guardsmen. Maybe that's just as funny though. I did find out you can drag a corpse up the ladder. Very useful that.<br><br>I eventually became part of a group that camped the Green/Elite room. Troilen and I were joined by Therra, with whom I've battled before. Bard Faredon helped us clean out the Elite room (it filled with&nbsp;&nbsp;three elites and one commander while we were gone) by mezzing the commander while we took the other three. Nice tool, that mezz. He stayed a bit to fight and sang us to full health and manna.  Then he moved on. Thanks Faredon.<br><br>We were joined soon thereafter by Taramac. He had a cool trick and we soon found ourselves literally walking on air. Fighting from a floating position was a unique experience, and I'm glad I got a chance to do it. I ended up leading the group because Troilen kept going LD. Taramac also ended up staying a while, pulling, giving us buffs, and keeping us healthy. He shared in lifting an ale to good hunting and we indulged in some drunken schenanigans<br><br>Reminder to self, get some batwings to give to Taramac so he float some other people. He also gave me some giant scale mail boots, and a blackened alloy coif, plus a bloodstained mantle, all with stats. I can only presume that this high level residents of the realm deem this their job, and I sincerly pray that I will one day be in a position to render such assistance to others. Eventually Taramac moved on, to help some others I presume. I will kneel to him whenever I see him.<br><br>We sought to increase our group, and were eventually joined by Lythander. We were now a L14 Half Elf Ranger, a L12 Druid Wood Elf, a L16 Barbarian Warrior, and a L16 Human Warrior. A good group. And soon Sirbere was again with us. Another L15 Barbarian Warrior. With all these tanks, Lyth and I need only to throw some spells and buffs, and melee only to fight with our friends. I also learned that I can jump onto things, and I sat on top of the barrel, with a great view of the entire room.<br><br>The realworld intruded and when I returned, I found myself alone, with Lyth's corpse at the entrance and everyone else scattered. Apparently they had drawn a bit more than they could chew. How I stayed alive I'll never know. But there were now two elite guardsmen in the room, and I had to carefully sneak out. I regrouped with Therra, Lythander retrieved his corpse, and the group disbanded.<br><br>Lyth returned with me to Qeynos, for I belived I had some ruined leather armor he could use for the Druid version of the pinescout quest. I was wrong, but I was able to give him some silk, and sundries. As always when I return home, I brew, bake and tailor whatever relevent supplies I've picked up during the day. <br><br>Then it was the end of another day in Norrath.<br><br>Donilla<br>Hunt long and safe<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>For some time I have been determined to complete the gathering of the ingredients needed for the completion of the Pinescout quest. I would need silk, and whiskers.<br><br>Once again I was side tracked by the chance to battle once again within the depths of Blackburrow. A friend, Troilen, a L15 Human Warrior, was already battling within, and I hastened to join him. We waged battle on the island with the wooden struction, and on the ledge near the bridge.<br><br>Much battling, much healing, and much experience ensued. We ran from a train, and killed a plague rat while we waited for it to disburse. We descended once again, and camped out at the Brewers ledge, but we were unsuccessful in our search for a cask.&nbsp;&nbsp;My good friend Wingurin (L31 Barbarian Shaman) dropped by to give us some buffs, and decided to stick around and play mentor to us for a while. <br><br>We descended once again to the Elite or Green room. And with Wingurins help, we were able to take on bigger and badder meanies, with the expected boost in experience. Wingurin transformed into his bear form. the first time I had seen this transformation. Lythand (L10 Druid Wood Elf) joined as well, another friend with whom I have battled in the past. With this happy grouping, Troilen soon dinged to L16, and we celebrated with a swing of Black Burrow Stout. We were joined by another old companion, Sirbere (L16 Barbarian Warrior), and not long thereafter, I met my first Iksar, and Zarsh (L15 Monk) joined us as well.<br><br>I had the pleasure of seeing an Iksar doing the Iksar walk and run full tilt around our little room. Apparently they are easily bored and quite hyper. Made for an enjoyable show.<br> <br>I was thrilled to ding to L14 in the midst of all the carnage. Another celebration and another swig of stout. Eventually, our protector left us. Our group was now of sufficient size for us to protect ourselves. We battled a Gnoll Tactician and looted some Black Burrow Battle Plans. Some research will be required to determine what quest this is for, although Zarsh indicated it was for a gimp? quest.<br><br>We lost Lythander to an elite gnoll guard. I also got my first sight of a Monk feigning death. It was hysterical. She dropped straight down like a board, lay there, and then popped straight back up - fabulous. Bigtoad graced us with some buffs. And traded me the last piece of ruined chain armor, the bracer, I needed to complete my armor quest. And another visual first, I got to see my first transformation to wolf form.<br><br>I also got two Onyx earrings, and an obsidian ring, both with stats. And of course after a time, the party began to disband, one by one. And then it my turn. Zarsh came with me to the entrance, and then I headed to Qeynos. I deviated from my path long enough to hunt some giant field rats, but none dropped what I needed.<br><br>In town I worked on my tailoring and brewing skills. I also had to purchase another quiver since I stupidly destroyed mine. And then I fletched some arrows and then called it a day.<br><br>Donilla<br>Hunt long and safe.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This day I was determined to solo, and to travel to less well known territories. I headed for West Karana.<br><br>I explored the shops in the North, and ran into Brother Estle and promised to bring him back some Blessed Oil. I hunted lions for their pelts, and grizzlies for their exp. And spiders for their silk. There was a foot race going on, but I declined to participate since I did not know my way to Misty Thicket. Maybe another day.<br><br>I met my match in a Grizzly and had to make my way back. Landa dropped by to give me some buffs so that I might live through my next encounter with the grizzly. I paid a visit to the Miller family, but stayed out of the cornfield. Something about scarecrows, a rumor I heard somewhere.<br><br>I returned to Qeynos, conducted business and then went to get Brother Estles's oil. I ran out of time and made camp near the Temple of Life.<br><br>The next morning I awoke and got the oil from Nomsoe Jusagta. And then headed to WK to bring the oil to B. Estle. He was happy to receive it, and he blessed me on my way. I continued to hunt lions and grizzlies, and to explore this land. I tried my hand at fishing in the Barbarian fishing village and then moved on.<br><br>Unfortunately I ventured too far. I found myself at what I learned later was the Ogre Shrine. I was smote once, then twice, and then I was dead. I returned to WK, but was consumed with much fear at the thought of having to venture once again into the area of that shrine.<br><br>I searched the area and saw there was a L51 High Elf Elementalist on the road named Qalamdarl of the Misty Knight guild. I beseeched his assistance, which he granted, and with his protection, I was able to drag my corpse away from danger. Qalamdarl would take nothing in exchange for his assistance except my heartfelt gratitude, and I followed him back to Qeynos.<br><br>A warning to all you adventurers. Those stone monolithes? Each is accompanied by an Ogre, and they will protect their Holy place. Beware. <br><br>I returned safely to my bed, with lessons well learned this day.<br><br>Donilla<br>Hunt long and safe<br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I started the day with my fletching kit before me and the wooden shafts, feathers, points and nocks spread all around me. The success and failures were about even, but in the end, I was in possession of a full quiver of arrows. The extras I sold, and then I headed out.<br><br>I sent a few tells to some friends, Qualestra and Peano, both were enjoying their endeavers far afield.<br><br>I decided to head for Everfrost to gather some more spiderling silk. I tracked and killed a few giant field rats along the way. I've heard that Chilled Tundra Root was hard to scrounge, but I scrounged up yet another, which automatically was destroyed since I already had one in my possession. I hope that those trying to find this item persist, it is out there.<br><br>I paid another visit to Halas, and did my banking and trade work while I explored the town. I choose to swim the channel like the local inhabitants, with no harm to myself. I returned to my hunt for spiderlings. Then returned to Surefall Glade. I made a quick mail delivery for the Bards. And then it was back to the whisker search.<br><br>I went to meet my friend Landa at the Q.Hills Guard tower. There I ran into one of the first people I met when I entered this land, Everrain (L9 Half Elf Ranger). It was she who gave me my first piece of armor, which stood me in great stead. She hadn't visited&nbsp;&nbsp;Norrath since then, and found herself having to start over from the beginning. I was sorry I had nothing on me to return the favor.<br><br>In the end Everrain and I left with Landa and headed for Blackburrow. Even with Landa there, it was not possible to avoid death, and so we died. We regrouped to hunt some more. Everrain left and Landa and I continued on. I joined up with a L13  Warrior named Grindal. I learned that all those copper coins sure get you encumbered fast. Too bad you can't change the coins outside of the bank.<br><br>And finally, I dinged.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This day I left Qeynos and headed for the Hills. Once again I was on the hunt for the elusive Giant Field Rat, actually the elusive whiskers. And yet again, frustration ruled the hunting.<br><br>My friend SK Peano told me to look up a friend of his, Qualestra, a L15 Dark Elf who was currently questing in Blackburrow. I did so, even though I'm starting to worry about all the chaos/evil<br>aligned friends I've been making. As a ranger I should be avoiding all such creatures. But with the common goal of battling the gnolls, and the sure knowledge that they are as friendly and helpful as all other inhabitants of this land, it's hard to justify such prejudice, and even harder to deny myself the company of such companions.<br><br>In any case, I received an invitation to join her and some friends in the Green Room, which I headed for with some verbal instructions. She met me along the way and escorted me to her companions. <br><br>Our company was Manicor a L14 Necromancer Dark Elf, Lythand A L10 Druid Wood Elf, and Beromir a L13 Warrior Barbarion. As soon as I arrived I found myself in the thick of battle. We camped and pulled and fought. We moved camp, and pulled and fought. We were joined by a friend of Beromir's, Therra a L14 Warrior Barbarian. It turns out Therra was still swordless for some reason, and on one of our forays back to the bank, I gifted her with a Longsword (that turned<br>out to be a bit of a mix up, but that's another story) that was too heavy for me to wield. We moved back to the green room and continued the hunt. One fight became a very near thing for me, but with healing spells and two tanks, death was averted, although recovery did take some time.<br><br>I had a chance to introduce Nick to the group, but there was no room for him in the group. He fought beside us non-the-less. The biggest news of the night was that I dinged to L12, Yipee. Everyone did a dance of joy, Nick moved on the other hunting grounds, and we battled on. Items, food and spells passed on from one to the other. We shared a swig of beer to celebrate my ding. There were times when some of the party came near to death, and times when the battles were easy.<br> <br>We decided to head for the Command Room, and finally, the good luck ended. We engaged a manageable group of gnolls, and they aggrod, and<br>a train came thru, and then some of us were dead. I recovered my corpse and was guarded by the group while I redressed. Therra was the last to return and the hunting continued. I went major LD and by the time I returned, everyone but Therra and Qualestra has left. I rejoined them, but our remaining time in BB was short, and Therra and I headed for Qeynos to sell off our loot. I was able to show Therra the town. And then we took our leave. <br><br>Another day, another death, another<br>ding.<br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>Donilla <br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Today I had decided taht I would complete my quest for the Ranger armor. And so I set out from NQ to kill the necessary rats adn gnolls. <br><br>I hunted some sankes for their eggs, with an eye to bettering my skill at baking. Then I had the good fortune to find a Giant Field Rat that dropped a pelt. I was on my way. Now for the chain mail.<br><br>I headed to BB. I headed for the ledge where I was told I might hunt with some modicum of safety. It was not to be. I had yet to lift my bow or swing my sword when I was beset by a seven gnoll patrol train. Needless to say, they were<br>too much for me. I managed to run to the outer area, but I died non-the-less, and found myself naked and hungry, heading back to BB. I was able to drag my corpse to a place of safety, and I<br>was back in business. However I had second thoughts about questing alone in BB as so I headed back for the Hills.<br><br>But plans like all else in life are subject to change. My friend Peano, a L12 SK was questing nearby and we agreed to hook up and hunt together. We headed into BB and hunted together, finding some chain mail and some good hunting.<br><br>We heard of group wanting more members, and so we headed for the green room, where we were befriended by Kosmicspirit, Catsongs, Moomax, and Steknis. I also want to thank Caldar and Gafner<br>for the gifting of the chain armor pieces needed for my quest. There were many gnolls dropping quest item, and I hope there were Druids and Rangers about who could take advantage of the items.<br><br>We hunted to much advantage in the green room and then moved to the Clover room. Refugee Splitpaw and his friends proved to be better than us, and though we got our target in the end, the cost was <br>high. Peano died first, in a heroic attempt to save the rest of us. I was slain by a gnoll, and at that point I don't know to whom the others suscumbed.<br><br>This is where my lack of experience began to show Im afraid. I simply could not find my way in the dungeon, and back to my corpse. Many thanks to my friend for their assist in this matter. Without<br>my track, Im apparently helpless.<br><br>We were joined by Wenina and Nick, and Catsongs left us. We sold off our loot in Qeynos, and as usual, I got lost on my way out of BB.. If I wasn't so afraid to venture into the depths on my own, I might learn the twists and turns of <br>this infernal warren.<br><br>In ran into old friend Jayco on the way back to BB, and with the groups permission, invited him to join us. This turned out not to work, as Jayco was a L9 and one of our members was a L15.<br>Apparently Jayco would receive no ex hunting with us, due to the disparity in levels. I felt very bad about this, but Jayco seemed fine and elected to increase his ex by hunting alone. And so he left us. Peano also choose this time to leave<br>the group, to make room for another expected friend, Sirbere who joined us shortly.<br><br>We were now a L11 Druid, a L11 Ranger, a L15 Paladin, A L12 Wizard, and Warrior Sirbere.<br><br>We had some difficulty finding prey, a group was camped in one of the main junctions, leaving little for the rest of us. We decamped, but ran into some resistance, and Kos was left unprotected<br>and thus died. I again got lost, but finally found Kos's corpse and remained there until he returned. We had chance to exact our revenge on Refugee Splitpaw and this time he was ours.<br><br>We decided to head for Ef and some better hunting. We regrouped at Bandls camp and were joined by another friend of mine, Outwit. Wenina had left us so there was room in the party.<br><br>Things didn't go so well for us in EF. We killed a Mammoth, but his friends aggrod on us, and Outwit fell victim to their vengence. We tried again, feeling if we worked together we could take<br>the Mammoth. But we were wrong, and though we didn't die, it was a near thing.<br><br>We were rescued by Gretzo, who led the others to safety although he was in dire need of healing himself. I was near death and had to lag behind to heal myself, getting lost once again in the<br>process. Before I could track back to Bandl, Kos was there to rescue me. A few orcs later and we were able to return to Bandl and safety.<br><br>The party decided to head farther North, and I chose this time to head for home. I took my leave of my new friends. I hope I have the chance to hunt with them again. <br><br>I got to Qeynos, encumbered though I was. I had enough pelts and patterns to complete the leggings and one bracer of the Pinescout quest. There are still some patterns, and whiskers to be hunted. But tommorrow will be soon enough, and<br>I made camp for the night.<br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>Donilla<br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

It took me hours to log on again, and I was fearful that I would find my body dead on the bottom of the ocean.

I in turn gave him the spider silk I had been accumlating. We headed for WK to find prey challenging enough to increase our skill. Instead we found some bandits, far more than we could handle and once again, I found myself heading back<br>from NQ to retrieve my corpse. For the first time I used the pulling corpse technique. We hunted as we returned to Qeynos, and after Clarin returned home, I decided to tailor the Pinescout armor.<br><br>I made the silk thread, and successfully combined the ingredients for the tunic and sleeves. Unfortanely, I discovered that I had made<br>the Druid leather armor, not the Ranger leather armor! Next time I'll need to remember to look at the ingredients more closely. Now I will have to continue my hunt.<br><br>I called it a night, with the quest still unfinished.<br><br>Hunt long and safe, and pay attention<br>Donilla<br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Today I decided to set out on a solo adventure. I had the Pinescout Quest to complete, and I had need of almost all of the components. I headed to the Hills to hunt Giant Field Rats, but the hunting was not good, and the rats I could find failed to drop the necessary items.<br><br>I had heard about a skulking gnoll in the caves of SFG, so I headed there, with thoughts of riding my home of a foul poacher of bears. I swam<br>to the caves and proceeded to explore. I found nothing and explored further. Further into disaster. In a cavern I found myself overcome by darkness, stomach cramps, pain. I tried to fight back, then I tried to run, but I became the victim of a Bloodsaber Defiler, a corpse lying far from my bind point.<br><br>I resurrected in NQ, and after equiping myself with a spare sword and bow, I headed back to SFG to retrieve my corpse. I was filled with fear at the prospect, and sought the aid of Nadasi, a L47 Wood Elf Druid. She was gracious enough to agree to help me with the CR, and was even willing to make the recovery on her own. But I felt that I<br>couldn't ask someone else to risk all while I remained safely behind. Together, we ventured into the caves, and I was fortunate enough to<br>find my body, without the defiler present.<br><br>She soon left to continue her previous quest and I was again on my own. I did some fishing while I relearned my spells. I returned to QH and continued hunting for the needed rats. Spiritwings told me she had heard they spawned near the marker, and so I headed to that area to hunt.<br><br>I had a conversation with Paladin Jayco, and we decided to head to EF for some hunting. We had a little trouble finding our way and soon decided to head back.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were assisted by Dalbas, and after making our way thru BB, we hunted a bit longer before we parted company.<br><br>I met Brelik, a L2 Human Druid just outside of SFG and we conversed while sharing some of my rat meat sandwiches. We parted and I continued the hunt. I was approached by Clonar who wondered if I might be willing to help him locate a particular prey. As I am always happy to help where I can, we attempted to locate the snake,<br>but unfortanely they were no where to be found, and we soon parted ways as well.<br><br>It was time to find rest, and I headed back to NQ and a good nights sleep.<br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>Donilla<br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The days trek started with the purchase of water and supplies. Then I hooked up with Landa and he was generous enough to give me a quiver and arrows, both of which he had made himself. The prize was a gift of an shaped ashwood bow, also an itme he crafted. My arrows are sure to find their mark now. His skill is far superior to my own, so I was glad for the gifts. Hopefully there will be some way to repay him in thr future.<br><br>I also learned the ingredient I needed to make fruit pies was eggs and milk. So now I have a few eggs, but haven't yet found the time to practice my hand at the culinary arts.<br><br>Then Landa left for other advertures and Clarin joined me instead. We headed to WK and hunted until we were loaded up and needed to sell. After a quick visit to NQ, we assisted a friend of Landas with some trades in various spots throughout Qeynos Hills. After some time this task was completed, and Wizard Maginus gifted us with some No Rent shields he had no use for.<br><br>We relocated to the Guard Tower in the Hills where we ran into an old friend Spiritwings. She had a technical question and Clarin was able to assist her.<br><br>After being joined by Maginus again, we headed for WK once again. We hunted and took on some bandits and farmers...luckily we won that ecounter, but not unscathed. Unfortantely I had cause to practice my bind wound skill, but recovery, while not swift, was certain, and we were off once again.<br><br>Clarin was called home and so Maginus and I headed for BB where we camped in the snake pits and Maginus started to pull. The snakes popped numerous times while we were there, and many gnolls fell to our skill. I practiced pulling, and learned much about the ettiquette in this land. We left BB, Maginus left to TP to another location and I returned to Qeynos to try some more baking and fishing. Then I called it a day and set up camp.<br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>Donilla<br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Todays plans were to buy some bait, learn to fish, and maybe learn to make some sandwiches to keep myself and future friends supplied with food.<br><br>To that end I began killing rats for their meat in the Hill. But rats were scarce, and I headed to Qeynos to try my hand at sandwich making instead. <br><br>Once there, I hooked up with my friend Clarin, and after performing a small service for him, we set out to BB to try and get some ruined chain mail to complete my Pine Scout quest. <br><br>We ventured deep into the lower realms of BB, engaging in many small battles. My Snare spell spend most of the day fizzling, but it worked just enough to help a small bit. We also took part in a major melee when a large gnoll train came through. Everyone fighting, gnoll bodies everywhere..it was a quite a site, and very exillerating! Our endeavors yeilded ruined boots and cap, although in all truth these acquisitions were achieved by Clarin, not I.<br><br>We headed to the bank to reduce our carry loads, and then hunted a bit in the Hills. We killed Yollis yet again, (these poachers just won't stay dead&nbsp;&nbsp;:):)  ) and then headed back to BB where we hunted for a short time before returning home to rest.<br><br>Today I learned about damage versus delay, and my next task will be to acquire a quiver and a better bow, so that I might use them for more than just pulling. The baking and fishing will have to be squeezed in somewhere.<br><br>Hunt long and safe<br>Donilla<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This day I set out in the Qeynos Hills to continue my Pine Scout Armor quest and to practice my hand at my newest skill, casting. Some bat wings, fizzled snare spells and lots of rats later, I decided that it was a good time to risk death by going to Blackburrow and eventually on to Everfrost. Although I was soloing, I was still a level 9, and dead isn't really dead, so.....<br><br>I traveled through BB with only one enemy contact. There were no fellow adventurers in the place, perhaps that is why I managed to sneak through almost undetected. <br><br>In Everfrost I was met by my friend Clarin, a L12 Wood Elf Bard. We quested a bit for silk thread, and then came upon Jinxie of the Norrathian's Nomads (a L10 High Elf Wizard, and joined him in a fight. We were all unable to save the poor adventurer to whom's rescue we all came, but we had ourselves a group now.<br><br>We hunted on, with the most troublesome of creatures, the LD monster, stalking my every path. In my absense, the group was joined by Outwit of the Norrathian's Nomads, A L11 Human Monk. Outwit pulled and we hunted well. Clarin had duties that demanded his presence elsewhere, and left our company, but we hunted on.<br><br>Hunting was so good I was frequently emcumbered, necessitating trips to the local merchants. I also had opportunity to make my first visit to Halas. However I chose to use the barge rather than make the swim across the lake. <br><br>Upon our return to Everfrost, the hunting continued, as did my education in how to survive this land. The group mix worked well, and we were richly rewarded for our endeavors. I was able to contribute with Minor Healing, Snare spells and the skill of my bow. We were soon joined by Spiritwings, and now we were four. <br><br>However the LD monster continued his pursuit and I returned to the distressing sight of my comrades corpses. I was pleased to learn that all were on their way back. The hunt continued.<br><br>My biggest scare came when I ran into a giant spider who proved too much for me. I managed to draw him back to my comrades, but damage and poison was rapidly taking it's toll. Without the care of my friends, I would surely have died, but instead I was pulled back from the brink, and lived on the hunt some more.<br><br>Jinxie departed for other realms, but the rest of us carried on. I began to take my turn with pulling and we hunted on for many hours until obligations called the party members home. We took our leave, and I returned without incident to my home of Surefall Glade. I needed to replenish my arrows, learn to fish, and learn to swim. During the course of my adventures, I had dinged to L10 and I now find myself in need of every skill I can muster.<br><br>Todays adventures yeilded many lessons, increases in skills, and much wealth. But the biggest gain was in acquiring some new friends, with whom I hope to hunt again.<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Quested today with Landa, a friend. We were on a the Pine Scout Quest, attempting to acquire for me a nicer set of leather armor. In Qeynos Hills we encountered Yollis and slew him, thus ridding the Hills of a notorious poacher. We found also a Barbarian, who we also slew for the benefit of our lands. We were rewarded in SFG with two longswords, upon which we must labor to make them usefull. We encountered many rats, but only a few giant or large field rats. So my search for the needed whiskers and pelts must needs continue.<br><br>To aid Landa, we headed to WK so we might obtain some woven spider silk. Whilst in those lands, we encountered a guild mate of Landa's, Sabyonne, and grouped together for our mutual experience.<br><br>The killing of grizzlies and lions commenced, with a few spiders also to be found. After a day of hard fighting, we called it a day, and Landa and I returned to SFG so that I might begin learning the casters skills I had recently aquired.<br><br>I returned to Qeynos to bank my acquisitions and excess monies, and now I rest for another day.<br><br>Hunt Safe and Long, and may Tunare watch over you<br>Donilla<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jun 25 23:40:04 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>May Tunare stand between you and all the dark places you must walk.</td></tr>
