	   <tr><td colspan=2>Charssk finished his meditations, opened his eyes, and rose to his feet. The raspy sound of the dying Sentinel gasping for breath was music to his ears, and he saw no reason to end it. The slow asphyxiation of the Erudite wasn't a full payment for the loss of his raiding party, but it would suffice, under the circumstances. With no voice, he couldn't cast his spells to heal his wounds. Indeed, having cast many spells during combat, Charssk doubted the Erudite had the mana left to cast at all, even if he had the voice to do it. Having already laid hands upon himself only moments before, by the time his deity deigned to grant him the power again, he would be long dead. With two broken limbs (the monk had seen to that,) he could not even crawl away for help. He grinned broadly, showing two huge rows of sharpened teeth at the dying sentinel. &quot;Embrace the darknesss, fool,&quot; he spat. &quot;It will claim you soon enough.&quot; <br><br>With that, he turned to the south, and headed towards the Heretic city. He would find the traitorous troll Rungupp, and show him the price of betrayal. Shortly, he came to the water's edge. The bridge was further towards the south, that much he knew, so he decided to swim rather than run. He would make better time that way, and it would be far easier to conceal himself in the dark water. <br><br>As he approached the bridge, he could see a figure crossing it through the fog. Perhaps adding another Erudite to the death toll would help assuage his anger... but no, first he would deal with the troll. One thing at a time. Business, then pleasure, as the humans liked to say. He went under the water and swam quickly under the bridge, leaving barely a ripple on the surface as he passed. <br><br>--- <br><br>Bejaizen moved across the bridge quickly, wanting to waste no time getting back to Erudin. The boat to Qeynos left in the morning, and if he missed it, he'd never reach High Keep in time for the meeting. As he crossed, out of the corner of his eye, he thought he caught some movement. He turned to look, and noticed a disturbance on the water's surface. It was very slight, like the passage of a caiman as it swam just under water, but there were no such creatures on Odus. Odd, but he had no time to wonder about it. He continued on his way, disappearing into the Toxxulian mists. <br><br>--- <br><br>The monk peered about, looking for the telltale glow of body heat in the distance. The troll was the largest thing he had seen in this forest, and the loudest. He shouldn't be hard to find. A familiar smell reached his nostrils, and his teeth bared involuntarily. &quot;Time to die, traitor,&quot; he thought to himself and he quietly crept towards the smell. Something was wrong, though. The smell wasn't quite right, Charssk sensed. Too much iron tang to it, as though... <br><br>He broke into the clearing, and saw the headless corpse on the ground. He let out a scream of anger, knowing he had been cheated of his vengeance! By whom, though? Charssk searched the area carefully, trying to find some small clue of the troll's killer. The cuts on the troll were clean. He was killed by a weapon of great quality, that was sure, but that information did Charssk no good. He looked closer at the corpse, a great feat, considering the smell. Under one fingernail, he saw a splinter. Pulling it out, he turned it over in his fingers. He held it close to his nose, and smelled it. The smell reminded him of home... this wood was Rock Cypress. That tree was only found in the swamps of Kunark. <br><br>He pulled the parchment from his pouch, and looked at the design of the shield carried by the Izrhume, the paladin called Bejaizen. He carried a targ shield, crafted in New Sebilis. Could it be? How supremely ironic that would be. He hissed in frustration, knowing that yet again, his goals were being thwarted. His eyes narrowed. He would need a new raiding party. The Empress would not be happy with his report, but he at least comforted himself that unlike her predecessors, she rarely killed those who failed on missions, unless that failure was through incompetence. He hoped she would not deem him a fool for his choices. <br><br>--- <br><br>The sun was coming up, though it was never seen under the tangled canopy of Toxxulian foliage. It did, however, brighten the gloom of the forest, for all but one living being in it. The sentinel gasped desperately for air, barely able to manage to pull in enough in one breath to be able to sustain him to the next. He knew he was dying, and his prayers to the Tranquil for deliverance seemed of no avail. His vision grew grayer, and he struggled to keep his eyes open. <br><br>He saw an out of focus figure emerge from the brush, and for a brief second, his hope flickered. Then his sight cleared slightly. The figure was a kobold runt. At least he'd be put out of his misery, but he had hoped that his last breath would not be due to being eaten alive. As the beast leaned over him, he saw it's jaws open wide to tear at his flesh... then its head came flying from its shoulders, and its body fell twitching at his side. <br><br>He heard the sound of a sheathing sword, and saw another figure kick the corpse away and kneel next to him. He could not make out the face, but the bluish gleam of his tunic was unmistakable. Only a handful of Erudite paladins wore the Midnight Sea mail, and he only knew of one currently on Odus. <br><br>Bejaizen saw the damage to the suffocating sentinel's throat, and knew he must act quickly. He could not lay hands upon him, that power had been used a few short hours ago to save a dwarven warrior that was near death in the Warrens. But perhaps he had gained enough mana to save the sentinel's life... He murmured a prayer and lightly touched the sentinel's neck. A blue light sparkled about him as healing powers flowed into his dying comrade. He saw the larynx mend itself, and air rushed into the sentinal's lungs. <br><br>&quot;Bejaizen, thank the Tranquil,&quot; he gasped, then let out a cry of pain as his movement caused his broken bones to shake. <br><br>&quot;Easy, Creot,&quot; the paladin said quietly. &quot;I need to splint these broken bones of yours, and bind your wounds. Then perhaps I can heal you enough so we can get you home.&quot; <br><br><br>--- <br><br>It was midday when the two Erudites reached the tunnel to Erudin. The sentinels at the gate took care of their injured compatriot as Bejaizen bid him farewell. He rushed to the docks, hoping against hope to reach the boat before it set sail to Qeynos. <br><br>--- <br><br>Bejaizen, of the clan Izrhume <br>18th Rank Paladin to Quellious <br>7th Legion, The Nameless<br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The boat approached the shore under cover of darkness, though even in the day, The area surrounding the Toxxulian forest seemed enshrouded in gloom.  The canny Iksar monk had no desire to take chances, however.  Only a fool would make a landing on the coast of Odus in daylight, if he was of a race the high men considered unwelcome, and Charssk would be most decidely unwelcome here.  <br><br>A small river wound through the forest.  The raiding party's landing had been in the southern part of the island, as according to his information, the Erudite guards never came to that part of the Forest.  His raiding party consisted of six Iksar, three dark knights, a necromancer, and another monk besides himself.  He would have preferred less brawn, and more brains, but you made do with what you could.  The boat was hidden, and party quickly made its way along the riverbank to where he was told there was a bridge.  It was there where he would meet his contact.<br><br>An hour later, they were in sight of the bridge.  As best as Charssk could tell, it was close to the appointed time - their contact should be appearing at any time.<br><br>Shortly, they heard a crashing sound, as though a huge boulder was rolling down a hill though dense underbrush.  On the breeze, slight though it may have been, was a stench that made Charssk wish the Iksar olfactory glands were a bit less sensitive.  Through the trees, he saw the source of the noise and smell.  A huge, misshapen troll (weren't they all?) smashed his way through a tangled mass of foliage and sat down on a nearby rock.  Scratching his hind quarters, he took out a bottle and drank its contents before unleashing a loud belch.<br><br>Charssk stepped out from the bushes and called out, &quot;Greetingsss, minion of the Emperor.  I am Charssk, sent here by Empress Usula herself.  Identify yourself, or...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or WHAT?&quot; The troll bellowed.  &quot;You think you scare me, you puny lizard?  I'll break you in half and use your bones as a toothpick!&quot;  Snorting, then laughing out loud, he continued.  &quot;Rungupp.  And this is MY forest.  So if you want my help, act like it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Forget your idle threatsss, troll,&quot; Charssk spat.  &quot;I am not alone, and you are.  Where is the softskin paladin, the Izrhume?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bah,&quot; Rungupp answered.  &quot;The peanut heads all look alike to me.  How should I know?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thiss one carries a sword, and a shield with this ssymbol on it.  You have seen it?&quot;<br><br>Rungupp looked over the sketch of the shield pattern.  &quot;Yah,&quot; he said, nodding.  &quot;I saw him head to Erudin last night from Paineel.  He fights the dogs in the Warrens all the time. I was going to jump him, but he had friends.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ssso do I,&quot; the monk responded.  As he made a gesture, the rest of his raiding party appeared through the bushes.  &quot;The Empress wishes him brought to her, and she will have him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmph,&quot; the big Troll snorted.  He waved a huge hand in the direction of the bridge.  &quot;Cross the bridge.  Turn right, go straight.  You'll get there.  Coupla guards in front.  Besides them, there's nothing across the bridge worth mentioning.&quot;  He got up, scratched himself again, and wandered off towards the south.<br><br>Charssk turned to his party.  &quot;Come, we will hide ourselves near to the entrance to Erudin, and capture the ssoftskin when he next leavesss the city.&quot;<br><br>With that, the Iskar raiding party marched across the bridge, and made their way to Erudin.<br><br>---<br><br>Rungupp snickered to himself as he ran towards the entrance to Paineel. The paladin was wanted by the Iksar queen, was he?  Capturing him would be a good way to curry favor with her, and maybe with Emperor Pusbag, as well!  If there was going to be glory in capturing this peanut head, it wasn't going to be had by the lizards, that Rungupp would make sure of.  <br><br>He hid in some foliage near the Paineel entrance.  The Paladin should come out soon, he was sure of it.  He sold his loot in Paineel, now that the Heretics there saw the value of his sword in killing the dogs infesting the Warrens under Stonebrunt, but every few days, he still made his way to Erudin with a bag of kobold teeth.  <br><br>The Troll shaman grinned broadly, showing a ghastly set of greenish-yellow teeth.  He would bring the paladin's head to his king, and maybe then he could get off this Innoruuk forsaken rock for good.  he chuckled to himself, imagining feasting on pickled froglok back in Grobb.  His wait wouldn't be long.  It was almost time... almost time.<br><br>---<br><br>The troll was going to die, that much was certain, Charssk vowed to himself.  &quot;Nothing worth mentioning,&quot; he said.  The monk he'd sent ahead as a scout was found in two pieces on the ground by one of the dark knights.  The other two were cut down by the Emissary and Sentinel that had been waiting in ambush for them, though the shadow knights had put up a good fight.  They managed to summon a pair of pets to help them in the battle, which hurt the Erudites, to be sure.  <br><br>When Charssk and the necromancer arrived, he felt sure they would kill the pair with no more losses.  But when the two softskins were near death, they laid their hands on themselves and healed themselves completely, curse them!  They fought like demons, and both shadowknights fell to their swords.  The necromancer was next, the Erudites together dispelling his pet, and somehow, they both knew no fear, as his attempts to instill it in them came to nothing.  Still, they were both badly hurt when the last shadowknight joined the battle.<br><br>Swords, shields, fists, feet, tails, and spells flew with abandon, and blood covered the ground all about them.  The shadowknight and emissary fell to the ground together, their swords buried in each other's chests.  Charssk saw his last companion die and hit the Sentinel in the neck with stiff-clawed fingers, crushing his throat.  Barely able to stand himself, Charssk looked about him.  His raiding party had been decimated, all because of the treachery of one filthy troll.<br><br>The troll was going to die.  With that as his mantra, Charssk carefully mended his wounds.  His natural healing powers would do the rest quickly enough.  Then it would be time for vengeance. <br><br>---<br><br>There he was!  Saliva ran down his chin as Rungupp anticipated the reward he'd get from the Emperor for bringing him the head of this Erudite.  He imagined what the paladin's shiny blue tunic would look like on his wall, his trophy for killing him.  After the Erudite had run past, Rungupp stepped out of the brush and began to cast a spell of blindness.<br><br>Bejaizen had exited the tunnel from the city of the Heretics and was heading home.  It was almost time to leave for the great convention called by Icewind Novastorm, and he could afford little in the way of delay.  As he quickly made his way through the forest, he felt his head start to swim, and his vision begin to go dark.  Shaking his head, he managed to throw off the effects of the spell in time to see a troll charging towards him!  Swinging his crystallized sword in a wide arc, he sliced a vicious gash in the trolls midsection.  Completing the swing, he cast a fast Yaulp spell, and felt a surge of strength course through him.  Then, with that strength, he bashed the troll with his shield, interrupting the casting of it's next spell, as well as stunning it briefly.  <br><br>In a fit of anger, Rungupp swung a large fist at Bejaizen's head, but Bejaizen ducked it deftly, countering with another deadly slash of his sword.  Rungupp suddenly realized, too late, that he had taken on more than he could handle.  He tried to run, but Bejaizen smashed him again with his shield, with the same effect.  Before he could come to his senses, the paladin removed the troll's head with a final stroke of his sword.  <br><br>Bejaizen put the head in an empty bag.  He knew there was a reward out for this troll, and the head was the proof he needed that his pest would no longer trouble the forest of Toxxulia.  <br><br>He hoped there were no more delays on his trip back to Erudin.  He did not want to miss the morning boat to Antonica...<br><br>---<br><br>(More to come, including Bejaizen's encounter with Charssk...)<br>---<br><br>Bejaizen, of the Clan Izrhume<br>17th Rank Paladin of Quellious<br>---<br>7th Legion, The Nameless<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Dec 22 08:07:17 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

Knowing his sister was still fighting in the Orc stronghold of Crushbone, it could only mean that his father had returned.<br><br>The door opened of its own accord, as it typically did when Arjaizen was in residence.  Bejaizen hung his cloak by the door and entered the great room, where his father sat reading by the fire.  Arjaizen looked up from his tome.  &quot;Welcome home, son.  How was your journey?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Far too long, father,&quot; the young paladin answered, &quot;but thankfully, mostly without event.&quot;<br><br>Arjaizen's head tilted slightly to one side in curiosity, and he asked, &quot;Mostly?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, there has been some disturbing news from the elven realms, that some number of Tunare's followers have betrayed her.&quot;  Bejaizen's brow furrowed with concern as he continued, &quot;There is talk of an assault of the Plane of Growth.  How any mortals could be so mighty as to attempt such as task is beyond me, but that is what I heard.<br><br>&quot;I also heard of a High Elf - a cleric of Tunare, I believe - who has taken up her defense as a task.  I have pledged my aid in this endeavor, if my aid can be of use.&quot;<br><br>Arjaizen stood and walked over to a small desk, where lay a folded parchment, sealed with blue wax.  The seal was stamped with what appeared to be a shield upon which were a snowflake, a blazing sun, and crossed lightning bolts.  It was addressed to &quot;Bejaizen, Clan Izrhume.  City of Erudin, Odus.&quot;  The wizard handed the parchment to his son, saying, &quot;Perhaps this message is related your pledge.  It was delivered only yesterday, by an Antonican Bard.  He told me it originated in Faydwer.&quot;<br><br>Breaking the seal, Bejaizen unfolded the letter and began to read. &quot;Yes,&quot; he confirmed, &quot;this is from Icewind Novastorm, the Elf I told you about.  He asks only that I keep vigilant, and send him word if I hear or see anything of the betrayers.&quot;  He looked up from the paper, clearly irritated.  &quot;What am I, a mere spy?  Fit only to slink in shadows and speak in whispers?&quot;<br><br>His father sighed softly.  The lad's pride would get him in trouble one day, he felt. &quot;No, my son, he means nothing of the sort.  You are seeking those who would confront gods in their own realms.  Do you think yourself ready for such a fight?  This Icewind is being cautious.  The first step in a war is seeking knowledge.  'Know thine enemies,' the saying goes, and the Elf understands that well.  Don't let your pride get in the way of your wisdom.  If you charge headlong into battle without knowing with whom you fight, that is a good way to get your head removed.<br><br>With a resigned snort, Bejaizen nodded. &quot;Yes.  Yes, of course.  I will remember that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;See that you do.  Now, was there anything else of interest on your trip?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, nothing much.  Just this.&quot;  He pulled a crumpled piece of parchment from his pocket and handed it to his father. &quot;Some deluded troll calling himself the Emperor.  Imagine that.&quot;<br><br>Reading the paper, Arjaizen's face grew ashen. He spoke softly to himself, &quot;...King Pusbag and the Iksar queen allied... a marriage of convenience? ...Emperor?  This does not bode well.&quot;<br><br>As his father spoke, Bejaizen's smug sneer grew smaller and smaller. &quot;What is it?  Who is this troll?&quot;<br><br>With shocked disbelief, his father looked at him.  &quot;Did they teach you nothing of the world outside of Odus in your training at the temple?  Pusbag is king of the Trolls, and a high priest of Innoruuk!  He rules over Grobb and it's surrounding environs with an iron fist.  That he might be allied with the Iksar, indeed, ruling over both Grobb and Kunark as Emperor, is not good news at all.<br><br>&quot;Odd though, that Queen Usula would submit to this,&quot; he mused.  &quot;Pusbag does not share power, he takes it.  If she thinks otherwise, I suspect the new Empress may find herself getting a nasty surprise sooner or later.  Either that, or Pusbag will.<br><br>&quot;In any case, have you spoken about this to anyone?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?  No, not really,&quot; Bejaizen replied.  &quot;There was some idle conversation in a South Qeynos tavern, nothing more.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Idle conversation,&quot; his father grumbled.  &quot;For your sake, I hope none of their spies were in earshot.  This is not an enemy you want to make at this point in your life.  Your deeds have already attracted local attention.  The number of Peacekeepers that can walk the streets of Paineel with impugnity can be counted on the fingers of one hand.  If the Troll king's spies see you as a potential future threat, they are unlikely to wait until you reach that potential to deal with you.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>The young Iksar entered the dark cave with barely a whisper of sound.  His curscale armor, while not offering great protection, was light and silent, and allowed the Swifttail to make full use of his amazing agility and dexterity in avoiding the blows of an enemy.  <br><br>Around a bend in the cave tunnel were several candles providing a dim light, which was more than enough for him and the cave's other occupant.  That occupant, seeing the Iksar monk enter, stood and greeted him.<br><br>&quot;Greetingsss, Charssk, the powerfully built shadowknight hissed.  &quot;What newss?&quot;<br><br>Bowing in deference to the Queen's messenger, Charssk answered, &quot;Crusssader, per your orders, I have followed the elf Icewind.  He hasss received word from an ally. A dark sssoft-sskin paladin.  I bear copiesss of their messages.&quot;<br><br>The Iksar Crusader took the notes, and read them both.  The ugly scrawls of the softskins were hard to decipher, but he had been taught to read several of their languages to one extent or the other.  That this note was written in their Common tongue made the task of translation somewhat easier.<br><br>&quot;Ssso, he seeks to aid the Elf?  Isss he of any conssequence?&quot;<br><br>The swifttail shook his tail as though unsure, and answered, &quot;Unknown.  I had him followed to Qeynosss.  He was tearing the noticess of the Emperor off the treess.  He boarded the boat to Odusss.  I know nothing more.&quot;<br><br>Rocking his head rhythmically side-to-side, the Crusader said, &quot;Very well.  Go back about your businesss.  If you are to do more to deal with this softsskin, you will be informed.&quot;<br><br>Bowing again, the monk silently slipped from the cave.  The Crusader turned the messages over in his hand.  That someone allied themselves with the Elf was unimportant by itself.  But he was also tearing down the Emperor's proclamations.  The Crusader thought little of the Troll king, to be sure, but he was sure that his Queen had plans within plans, and that sooner or later, she would remain as sole ruler of the Iksar Empire, which would extend over all of Norrath.  Such was her divine right, and the natural destiny of the Iksar.<br><br>If this paladin was presuming to impede the fulfillment of his Empresses wishes, he would soon learn the folly of his ways.  Blowing out the candles, he left the cave, and made his way to the coast.  It was time to return home with news for his queen.<br><br>---<br><br>The knock at the door came in the early afternoon.  Bejaizen finished buffing the last smudge off his Midnight Sea Mail tunic and got up, then set it down on the chair in which he had been sitting.  It gleamed a deep blue color that he had never seen on any other suit of armor.  It, along with the crystallized long sword he had recently purchased, clearly identified him as a paladin even at a distance.  It was a badge he wore with pride, and if that pride was a vice, then so be it.<br><br>He opened the door, and saw Ticar Lorestring of the Antonican Bards.  Lorestring greeted him, and handed over a letter sealed with a symbol he was unfamiliar with.<br><br>Thanking Ticar, and giving him some coin for his troubles, Bejaizen took the letter and opened it.<br><br>&quot;Greetings Bejaizen Izrhume,&quot; it began.  &quot;It seems you have been unwise enough to side with that weak High Elf Icewind Novastorm, and his pathetic plots against the rulership of Pusbag and Ourself. <br><br>&quot;We warn you not to mettle in affairs beyond your scope of comprehension, and demand you withdraw any support you might have offered Our Elven cattle, upon pain of torture. Death is, afterall, a bit dull.  (signed) Usula Wurmbane-Infection, Iksar Necromancer, Empress of Fear&quot;<br><br>As he read the closing signature, he felt an involuntary chill, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end.  How did the Queen of the Iksar know about his pact with Icewind?  What plots was she talking about?  He had, after all, only offered his assistance in bringing the renegade Elven betrayers of Tunare to justice. <br><br>What had he gotten himself into?<br><br>---<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Dec 24 11:21:09 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

Lord Bulrious has designated that I should attend to speak for the Peacekeepers.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The owner of the Centurion's insignia finished polishing it to a high luster, gently placed it into the small cloth-lined box, and closed the lid. Placing it in his footlocker at the 7th Legion headquarters in Halas, he turned to the mirror and affixed the equally polished legionary's insignia to the collar of his tunic. He straightened his tunic, squared his shoulders, and after a last wistful glance at the closed footlocker, turned on his heel and walked out the door.<br><br>Making his way to Scei's Tavern, he wondered about what might have been, but thrust the thoughts from his mind. Serving the greater good was what mattered, and it was more important that the Legion's officer corps was filled with the guild's best and brightest, not those who were merely good with a sword. He had done the right thing, of that he was certain. What others might think didn't matter.<br><br>He entered the cozy confines of the tavern, and sat at the bar. Looking about to see who was working today, he noticed Sonja taking care of a group of adventurers in the corner. An attractive enough girl, but one of the smaller barbarian women you were likely to see, Sonja was not one for combat, and working the tables of the tavern was fulfilling enough for her. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of a hand slapping the ash wood bar top.<br><br>&quot;Hey, quit checkin' out the help, you letch. You're old enough to be her dad.&quot; Scei had an ear-to-ear grin, pleased that she'd managed to stop her fellow Legionnaire's heart for a brief moment. &quot;Nice to see ya, Barrik,&quot; she said. &quot;The usual?&quot;<br><br>The gray-bearded ranger nodded. &quot;Hi Scei, yah, that'll do fine... and a sandwich. Whatever isn't moving.&quot;<br><br>Scei opened the door to the kitchen and yelled to her cook. &quot;Hey Gunnar, one shaved mammoth steak sandwich. Load it up.&quot; Turning back to the bar, she took a stoneware mug, drew ale for Barrik and set it down in front of him. &quot;Here you go, pal,&quot; she said. Seeing a few new customers at the other end of the bar, she added, &quot;Duty calls,&quot; then turned to take care of them.<br><br>...<br><br>Barrik was halfway through his sandwich when he heard the distinctive sound of boot heels clicking together.<br><br>&quot;Hail, Sir!&quot; he heard a booming voice say. He turned to see the speaker, and saw a human warrior in meticulously cared-for armor. The warrior snapped him a crisp salute.<br><br>&quot;Well met, Dracoius,&quot; he responded. &quot;But you can skip the salute.&quot; Gesturing to his tunic collar, he added, &quot;I'm not an officer any more, remember?&quot;<br><br>His compatriot looked confused. &quot;But, you're still a Centurion, aren't you?&quot; he asked.<br><br>The half-elf shook his head. &quot;No, an officer has to have an office. When I gave up the Politico's position, the rank went with it. I'm just a grunt, my friend.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You must be very disappointed that you were not offered the position again by the new Caesar,&quot; Dracoius offered.<br><br>&quot;Actually, I'm relieved.&quot; He took a drink and set down his glass before continuing. &quot;Look, all I ever wanted to be in my life was a Legionnaire. One of the rangers in the Surefall guild was in the Legion, and he would tell me stories about the Legion's legends. I wanted to be part of that history. But an officer?<br><br>&quot;I work hard, and I do my duty. I'm at home in the fields and forests. I'm a doer, not a thinker, and officers need to be thinkers. Taking the Politico's position was a mistake on my part. But when Fortenbras offered it to me, I thought it was my duty to accept. Wasn't until later that I figured out I was the wrong guy for the job. As fate would have it, Fortenbras was never able to swear me in, so when Biffington was given the Caesar's title, it gave me the chance to do the right thing. Thankfully, Biffington saw what I saw - that I was in over my head.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not many have the courage to admit their limitations,&quot; Dracoius mused. &quot;That was an honorable thing to do.&quot;<br><br>Barrik shrugged. &quot;I don't know. In a way, it was the most selfish thing I've ever done. Time will tell, I guess.&quot;<br><br>Laying a few silver pieces on the bar, he gave Scei a wave from across the room, and then turned back to Dracoius. &quot;Time to go, Drac. Got a long journey ahead of me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where are you off to?&quot; the warrior asked.<br><br>Barrik shrugged a second time, and pointed off in the general direction of southeast. &quot;Not sure... that way, perhaps.&quot;<br><br>Dracious snapped a sharp salute to Barrik as the ranger headed towards the door. Hearing the click of Dracoius' heels, Barrik stopped. Turning halfway about, he raised his left eyebrow as a question.<br><br>The warrior shrugged and said, &quot;All Legionnaires are deserving of a salute, my friend. Whatever rank you hold doesn't matter to me.&quot;<br><br>Barrik grinned in spite of himself and shook his head. Clenching his right fist and tapping himself on the chest just over his heart, he said, &quot;Thanks, Drac. Good journeys to you, my friend. See you around.&quot;<br><br>With that, he walked out the door, and disappeared into the swirling snows of Halas.<br> <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Dec  4 09:51:10 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>(Not the climactic chapter, but it seemed a good way to make an introduction.  It also fit in with the timeline.) -Arj<br><br>--------------<br><br>A hundred candles burned in the temple chamber where a dozen young men and women stood at a crisp attention.  Their studies had been long and arduous, their physical training near back-breaking, but it was now complete.  Twelve new paladins to Quellious the Tranquil were now ready to join the ranks of the Peacekeepers of Erudin.  Lining the room were 20 of the temple's Guardians, there to welcome the new brothers and sisters into their ranks.<br><br>Depnar Bulrious, leader of the Peacekeepers, his gleaming armor reflecting the light of the fivescore tongues of flame, glittered as the sky on a clear starry night as he moved down the line of his new Holy Warriors.  With a critical eye he appraised them, and finally gave a solemn nod.  When he spoke, it was quietly, but with a deep resonance that seemed to reach inside of all who listened, holding their attention firmly in its grasp.<br><br>"Holy Warriors of Peace," he began. "Words that seem on the surface to be a contradiction.  How can one fight for peace?  Such is how many misunderstand the teachings of the Tranquil.  Our battle is not with war itself, but with chaos, fear, hatred, and greed.  These things douse the flame of inner peace.<br><br>"We seek not worldly wealth, but to have what is needed, and to be thankful for the opportunity to help others have the same.  We seek not power, but the wit and might necessary to defend the weak and powerless.  We fight so that others may know peace without.  In so doing, we find our own within."<br><br>As he spoke, one of the new Peacekeepers reflected on that which brought him to this place...  <br><br>Erudites who chose to take up the sword were few and far between.  Though respected after a fashion for their dedication to their gods, They were still thought strange.  The children of Erud were of course intended to harness the eldritch forces of the universe and were the undisputed (to them, at least,) masters of their craft.  Those closest to their gods and wisest in their ways became the clerics of the temples, healing the bodies and spirits of all who came for their help.  Swords were distained by those who practiced their crafts in the three towers of the palace.<br><br>The tower of the Crimson Hands housed the school of Wizardry.  From that school came Arjaizen Izrhume, father to Bejaizen.  He was not one of the school's better students, to say the least.  His personality was unreserved and unrestrained.  He seemed to care little what others thought, which was probably a good thing, as most others thought him insane.<br><br>To the amazement of many, he managed to capture the attentions of Ashaura, a young cleric of Quellious, and they soon were wed.  Bejaizen was their first born.  Being the son of "Arjaizen the Insane" took a toll on the boy, and when Ashaura died giving birth to his sister Euara, the distance between son and father grew wider.<br><br>Bejaizen left his home at the age of fourteen to begin his training.  Wanting to honor his mother's spirit, he took to the Temple of Quellious, yet not to follow in her footsteps as an Acolyte of Peace.  For years, he had felt shame at how his father was thought of by the powers that were in Erudin.  Perhaps, having a touch of rebellion in him (he was, after all fourteen,) he wished to spite those who would judge him on his father's actions.  Knowing the priests revered the paladins, but the wizards distained them, he chose the path of the Peacekeeper.<br><br>Where his father struggled as a student, Bejaizen excelled.  He trained his body as few others would, and threw himself into his spiritual studies with abandon.  Finally, after six long years of training, study, and apprenticeship, it was over.<br><br>"...and so, it is with a great deal of pride, that I say, 'Welcome, Peacekeepers, and well done.'  May the Tranquil guide you and bring her peace to all about you."  Bulrious clasped the hand of each paladin in turn, and returned their salutes.  A small reception was held, after which Bejaizen found himself speaking with Leraena Shelyrak, high priestess to the Tranquil.<br><br>"You should go home now, Bejaizen," she counseled.  "Be with your family."<br><br>"My sister is in the Tower of the Crimson Hands, pursuing her own studies.  They would not release her for the ceremony, and she faces an apprentice's test tomorrow.  My father is home, but I doubt he even knew of the graduation."  Bejaizen looked at the ground. "I never told him.  I've spent six years pursuing a path wizards mock.  Why would he care?"<br><br>"He is a follower of the Tranquil," the priestess countered.  "That in and of itself is very rare among wizards.  And he wed one of us.  Perhaps he would provide us with another surprise.  Go.  If you are accepted, be thankful.  If not, you always have a home here."<br><br>He stood before the door of his childhood home.  Rarely occupied for the last several years (he and Euara being in their respective schools and their father traveling the world,) this night there was a glow coming from the windows.  He reached out to knock on the door, but it slowly swung open of its own accord.  As he entered, it closed behind him, and he heard his father's voice coming from the living room.<br><br>"Since when does a man need to knock on the door of his own home?  Has it been so long that you've forgotten who lives here?"  His father sat grinning from a chair by the fireplace.  "You are looking well, son.  It's good to see you."<br><br>Bejaizen nodded solemnly.  "Thank you, father.  You also appear in good health."<br><br>The wizard got up and went over to a table where stood two decanters and two wine glasses.  As he walked across the room, he asked, "What brings you home today?"<br><br>"I came to tell you... I graduated today.  I am no longer an apprentice, but a Peacekeeper."<br><br>"I know.  I was at your graduation."<br><br>Bejaizen looked confused. "How could you be?  I didn't see you.  I didn't tell you."<br><br>His father grinned.  "I am a wizard.  Few people are able to see me if I do not wish it so.  And did you really think I would not be checking on your progress?  Bulrious told me of your graduation day months ago."<br><br>Pouring one glass from each of the decanters he offered one glass to his son. "A toast, my son," he offered.<br><br>Shaking his head, Bejaizen demurred.  "No, Father, I do not drink alcohol."<br><br>Rolling his eyes, Arjaizen responded, "I know that. For the love of the Tranquil, have SOME faith in your old man.  Your glass has fruit juice."<br><br>"And yours," his son asked.<br><br>"The finest Elven wine I could find for the occasion.  I respect your beliefs son, but my Barbarian friends tell me that for a toast to count, there must be alcohol involved.  I didn't want to take a chance," he grinned.  "Ten thousand Barbarians could be wrong, but the Dwarves seem to agree with them.  Who am I to argue?"<br><br>Sighing, Bejaizen shook his head.  Nonetheless, he took the offered glass and raised it.<br><br>"To peace," Arjaizen toasted. "Your mother would have been proud."<br><br>"To peace," Bejaizen answered, and they drained their glasses.<br><br>"I have a gift for you, son.  Some things to help you in your journeys."  He walked over to a large chest, and opened it.  Inside were a number of pieces of armor.  Most had seen some use, but were in excellent repair.  Several were banded armor, a few leather, but Bejaizen was surprised to find almost a full set.  "I believe you will find they all fit.  Oh, there's one more piece."<br><br>At the bottom of the chest was a box, which he handed to his son.  Bejaizen opened it, and his eyebrows raised in surprise.  Inside the box was a finely made studded leather tunic, clearly new.  "Thank you, father...where did you buy this?"<br><br>"I didn't," the wizard answered.  "I made it.  The high and mightys in the Crimson Hands told me to learn a trade... so I've learned several, among them tailoring and smithing.  I hope you like it."<br><br>"It's excellent.  I'm surprised.  I thought you would be embarassed that I chose the way of the sword."  He added, "The casters of the palace think it undignified."<br><br>"Oh, please," his father snorted.  "As though the thoughts of the closed-minded stuffed robes in the towers concern me in the least anymore."  He smacked himself lightly in the forehead and said, "Oh... Can't forget the weapons."<br><br>"Weapons?"<br><br>"Of course.  No son of mine is going to battle with a piece of junk in his hand."  He reached into a closet and brought out a leather-bound scabbard.  "This two-handed sword is of fine steel.  An excellent blade, but not for all situations.  In tighter quarters, you'll need something smaller.  There are also some creatures that cannot be harmed by any weapon that is not enchanted in some way."  <br><br>Going to the closet again, he withdrew a second scabbard.  From this he drew a longsword with a blade the likes of which Bejaizen had never seen.  Looking like a translucent crystal, or perhaps ice, it almost seemed to glow.  "This is made from Velium, from the long-lost continent of Velious.  Should you run into a creature that cannot be harmed by the two-hander, use this."<br><br>Bejaizen was stunned.  "I don't know what to say."<br><br>"Just wear the armor with pride, and wield the weapons with honor," his father answered.  "I must go now, son.  There is a battle coming in the Citadel of Runnyeye, and the 7th Legion has been asked to help."<br><br>As Arjaizen began casting a gating spell to transport himself across the leagues to Rivervale, his son bid him goodbye. "Fare well, father, and thank you."<br><br>The spell complete, a glimmering portal began to form itself around the wizard.  Over the eerie sound of warping space he called, "Oh, one more thing, and most importantly:  Do good."<br><br>"You mean, 'do well,'" Bejaizen corrected.<br><br>As the portal closed about him, Arjaizen smiled one more time.  "No... Do good."  With a final flash, he was gone.<br><br>The new paladin stood alone, as he realized at last how different the reality of his father was from his memory.  A lone tear ran down one cheek.  "I will, father, I swear it."<br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have been reading them.  There are some very good writers here.  While a good number of folk seem to prefer the first person style of writing (what one might call a "true" journal,) in general, I tend to prefer third person.  That's why you see this journal listed as "fiction" rather than "role playing".<br><br>The first chapters of "In the Gorge" were written a while ago.  I've not done a lot to finish the story, but I do plan to. One day, I decided to put the whole thing into a Word document, and I was shocked to learn it was ten pages long.  I wasn't intending to write an "epic" when I started. :-) Now I'm faced with coming up with a suitable climactic finish.<br><br>A note about a couple of the "guest" characters in my stories.  If you are ever on the Nameless server, are a fan of RP, and get the chance to group with Marchant Braemar, do so.  His "owner" is an excellent role-player, and Marchant is a paladin's paladin.  One of my most enjoyable gaming sessions was the night that he and I happened to hook up in the Gorge of King Xorbb, and writing the dramtization of that session is what started my chronicling of Barrik's adventures in the Gorge.  Marchant will appear in the next chapter of the story.<br><br>Barrik ran into Cona in North Karana one night, and we decided to team up.  We fought well together, and decided to play on a regular basis.  Arjaizen has since replaced Barrik, and the Shaman/Wizard pairing has worked even better.  Both are now 21st level, and visiting Castle Mistmoore... well, the front yard of it, anyway. :-)  Cona is also a terrific guy, and a lot of fun to play with.  Not a dyed-in-the-wool role-player, but has a style all his own.<br><br>While I consider Arjaizen as my "main" character, Barrik is actually my highest in levels.  I went on a tear with him for about 7 or 8 levels, rushing to get him to 20th, and his surname.  I also use him as my "scout".  I send him into new zones to get a feel for the place before Arjaizen gets his robes singed.  If I do something stupid with Barrik, I know he's got a chance of getting out with his skin. :-)<br><br>I've played for about a year and a half, but generally only 2 or three times a week.  I also have 5 different characters because I can't make up my mind.  :-) Right now, the one getting a chunk of game time has been Arjaizen's "son" Bejaizen, a paladin of Quellious.  Don't be surprised to see a story or two about him soon.<br><br>Anyway, I'm glad you like the stories so far.  Thank you for the kind and encouraging words.<br><br>Fare well, and good hunting to you!<br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The two adventurers peered carefully over the rock, watching the evil eye and two minotaurs.  The horned giants stood mesmerized by the floating orb, while an animated sword and shield, the "pet" of the eye, drifted about the area, as though on patrol.<br><br>"I don't like it," Cona grumbled.  "Those eyes never do much with any but themselves.  Why is that one so interested in those minotaurs?"<br><br>"Communicating, most likely," Barrik answered.  "The eyes don't talk.  Their voices just kind of ring through your head."<br><br>The big shaman's eyes narrowed. "How'd you know that?"<br><br>"One charmed me once.  I was lucky that someone else attacked it and managed to distract it enough that I could break the spell.  A scary thing," Barrik said, "not being able to control your own arms and legs."<br><br>"Aye, it would be," Cona muttered in agreement.  He pointed off in the distance, where a small, pale bluish-green humanoid approached. "Look.  A goblin's coming this way."<br><br>"What is this, a summit meeting?  This could be important to our mission.  I'm going to try for a closer look," the ranger said, as he cast a spell of camouflage and slowly snuck his way closer to the group.<br><br>Several tense minutes passed as Cona watched and waited for his friend to return.  As he watched, the goblin's arms began to wave, and an eerie light surrounded him.  Cona recognized the translucent haze coalescing around the goblin as a wizard's spell of shielding.  A moment later, Barrik appeared out of nowhere, whispering "Let's go... quietly."<br><br>...<br><br>They waited about a ten-minute walk from where they had spied the meeting.  This was the way back to Runnyeye, and they felt certain the wizard would return down the same ravine.  A short time later, they heard it approach.  Waiting for the goblin to pass (for they didn't want it to flee back towards the evil eye,) they prepared their ambush.  <br><br>Once it was past, Barrik spoke arcane words, and roots grew from the ground, entangling and starting to crush the goblin's spindly legs.  Cona spoke in a similar though slightly different tongue, and a freezing blast of icy shards slashed at the wizard, preventing it from getting off its own counter spell.  As it readied another spell, Barrik let fly an arrow, which buried itself in the goblin's throat.  As the roots slowly withdrew from the pale corpse&#8217;s legs, it crumbled to the rocky ground.<br><br>Searching the body for evidence, they found a paper.  "What does it say?" Cona asked.<br><br>I don't know.  I don't recognize the language," Barrik replied.  "We'd best get this back to the Mayor's office in Rivervale.  Perhaps someone there can make it out."<br><br>Hiding the corpse in a crevice, they quickly and quietly made their back to the home city of the halflings.<br><br>...<br><br>"Oh dear, oh dear," Gobo Furryfoot wailed.  "This is terrible.  Most terrible."<br><br>Mayor Gubbin of Rivervale looked at his chief linguist and asked, "What's terrible?"<br><br>"The goblins," came the response. "There are at least three times what we thought.  We'll never stop them ourselves, never!  And they are planning an offensive, in seven days time!"<br><br>The Mayor turned to the Ranger of the 7th Legion and the Barbarian of Halas.  The weariness had darkened his face, leaving him looking haggard and tired.  He said, "Then we are lost.  Thank you for your help, we will evacuate our old, infirm, and children as best we can. The rest of us will try and at least make the goblins feel they have paid a price for our homes."<br><br>Barrik looked at the floor and let out a long sigh.  Then he straightened up, and with steely eyes asked the Mayor, "Do you know how the 7th Legion came to be?"<br><br>Nodding his head slowly, the Mayor replied, "The Legion of legend died to a man, defending Halas from a gnoll invasion."<br><br>"Yes.  And the Legion of the present, if necessary, will die to a man defending Rivervale," the Legionnaire promised.  "There is a line beyond which evil has not, can not, and WILL not cross.  WE are that line.  If you but ask, Mister Mayor, the Legion will come."<br><br>Gubbin considered the graying ranger and for the first time in weeks, it seemed as though the weight on his shoulders had been lessened.  "Bring your Legion... and thank you."<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>To: Fortenbras Oberonis, Caesar<br>From: Barrik Moonhunter, Legionary<br>Re: A Call to Arms<br><br>Hail, Caesar!<br><br>I bring bad tidings.  The forces of the goblins in Runnyeye are far stronger than the halflings of Rivervale expected, or can hope to defeat.  The Mayor of Rivervale has requested the further aid of the 7th Legion in fighting the evil horde.<br><br>Intelligence I have been able to gather indicates that the unholy alliance between the goblins of Runnyeye and the minotaurs of the Gorge of King Xorbb may have been facilitated by the King of the Gorge's Evil Eyes.  It may be that the eyes feel their present domains are too small, and wish to expand their power.  Since they appear to be enchanters of no small power, this is of great concern.<br><br>I request that the Caesar, the Marshall of War, and the Council authorize a raid on the Runnyeye Citadel, so this scourge of central Antonica may be beaten back into submission.  Further, that some of our most powerful Legionnaires enter the Gorge of King Xorbb with the intent of slaying the leadership of the evil eyes, thereby striking at the heart of the goblin/minotaur alliance.<br><br>To the Glory of the 7th!<br><br>In service to Karana,<br><br>Barrik Moonhunter, Legionary<br>C/O League of Antonican Bards, Rivervale<br><br>--------<br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>"RUN!", Barrik shouted.  "Withdraw to the tunnel, they won't fit inside!"<br><br>Marchant ran as fast as he was able, desperately trying to get to the relative safety of the Runnyeye tunnel before the five onrushing minotaurs could reach him.  Near the cave entrance, Barrik fired arrow after arrow at the lumbering beasts, hoping to slow them down.  As Marchant ran past, Barrik cast a spell on one of the minotaurs, then dashed into the tunnel just as the enraged group reached him.  <br><br>Running quickly down the corridor and around a bend, he stayed and took aim with his bow back down the tunnel.  The low ceiling and tight confines made his range extremely short, but they also prevented the minotaurs from coming down more than one at a time.  Even then, they would hardly be able to move, and certainly could not fight to any effect.  Though they were not exceptionally bright creatures, they knew suicide when they saw it, and did not try to follow.<br><br>Turning to look at his partner, Barrik frowned and asked, "Would you mind telling me what THAT was about?"<br><br>Still trying to catch his breath, Marchant gasped, "Ambush... two out in the open... struck one with a spell... tried to lure them...&#8221; He took a deep breath and managed to speak more clearly.  "When I turned, I saw the other three coming down from hiding.  All I could do was run to here."<br><br>"Well, I guess our friends are smarter than they look... not that that's very hard. Just try and be more careful.  Next time you might not make it.  Come on," the ranger said.  "They've run off.  Let's go claim our prize."<br><br>A confused look came across Marchant's face. "Prize?"<br><br>"Well, you don't think I was going to let you go through that for nothing, do you?", Barrik responded with a grin.  <br><br>He would say nothing more as they moved back down the tunnel to the entrance.  Sure enough, the minotaurs were gone.  The ranger could clearly see their tracks leading off to the north.  All but one, that is.  One minotaur remained, running off to follow its mates.  It tried to run, anyway.  For all the speed it was generating, one would think it was up to its knees in mud.  <br><br>The young paladin looked back and forth from the minotaur to Barrik, a questioning look on his face. "Snare spell?", he asked.<br><br>"Got it in one," Barrik answered.  "Shall we?"<br><br>Narrowing his eyes, Marchant responded with a steely, "Aye, we shall," and charged the lone minotaur, his sword held high.<br><br>Barrik cast a flame lick spell to enrage the creature, then nocked an arrow and let it fly as the minotaur turned to face its attackers.  He then quickly stowed his bow, drew his axe and short sword, and ran to the fray.  The combined swordplay of the two half-elves was too much for the beast, and it quickly fell to their blades.<br><br>The weapon used by the minotaur was a large axe, balanced for use with one hand.  It was extremely sharp and well made.  Barrik looked at the tarnished sword Marchant carried, and said, "Here, you take it.  It will certainly work better that that thing."<br><br>To his surprise, the paladin refused. "I do not use axes.  A paladin's weapon is his sword.  This one will have to do until I earn, or can make, a better one."<br><br>"When we are next in Rivervale, I will give you one of mine, then.  I have more than I can use, and any one would be an improvement over your sword."<br><br>"No," Marchant said proudly. "As I said, I will not be beholden to others.  I appreciate your offer, but if my own toil didn't earn it, I don't want it."<br><br>"I'll keep that in mind on your birthday," Barrik said under his breath as he put the axe in his pack.<br><br>"Excuse me?" <br><br>"Nothing, it wasn't important."<br><br>They fought side-by-side for most of the day, carefully avoiding large groups, but noting their encampments.  When they found one alone, or two together, they would attack, with spells, swords, and bow, and prevailed in every battle.  Between the two of them, they had sufficient healing spells to keep them going.  But as the sun started to disappear over the mountaintops, as they rested by a fire near the Runnyeye entrance, Marchant noticed an odd looking creature coming towards them.  It looked for all the world like a shambling pile of mud. "What is that?", he asked.<br><br>"A muddite," Barrik answered, drawing his weapons.  "An elder one, if I judge correctly.  Be careful.  They don't look like much, but they hit hard... very hard."<br><br>Marchant quickly learned how hard when the muddite hammered him with a powerful fist.  He staggered back a step as he returned the blow.  Barrik joined the battle, slashing the thing's shoulder with his granite tomahawk.  Amazingly, the wound seemed to close somewhat, though the creature grunted with pain.  It turned on Barrik and swung an arm in his direction, flinging mud in the ranger's face, blinding him.  As Barrik struggled to clear the mud from his eyes, the muddite turned back to Marchant, parrying his sword blow.<br><br>"Argggh!", Barrik yelled.  "My eyes!"  He struggled to quickly clear them as his partner fought with the muddite.  As his vision began to clear, he felt a cold stab of dread.  Behind Marchant, blocking the way to the passage was a huge minotaur.  He recognized it as one of the ones they has seen deep in a chasm earlier in the day.  "Chasm minotaur behind you!", he bellowed.  As he turned to block its path to his new friend, a second one slammed him sideways.  "Two of them!", he called.<br><br>With one final crushing blow, Marchant felled the muddite, and turned to the minotaur attacking him; deftly parrying it's first swing.  Though getting hammered by his own foe, Barrik aided his already-wounded partner, and they both flailed away, trying to kill one of the beasts quickly.  Near to collapse, Marchant landed a killing slash to the throat.  <br><br>Barrik quickly turned and landed a crushing kick to what passed for the remaining minotaur's knee, forcing it to briefly lose its balance.  Marchant, heedless of his own wounds, began healing the battered and bloody ranger.  However, his heals could not hope to keep up with the savage beating Barrik was receiving from his horned adversary.  All his mana finally exhausted, Marchant watched with horror as Barrik dropped to one knee from a devastating strike.<br><br>As Barrik lifted the sword gifted to him from Morin Shadowbane in what he knew was a last act of defiance, he saw the minotaur howl in triumph.  His vision started to turn gray, and he knew his life, and most likely the life of his new friend was about to end.  Suddenly, a rush of warmth and energy flowed through his body.  He felt every cut, every bruise, every fracture suddenly heal itself in an instant as the Holy Warrior of Mithaniel Marr laid his hands upon his shoulders and called for his god to aid him.<br><br>The giant minotaur fell back in surprise as his all-but-dead opponent suddenly turned and hit him in the solar plexus with a powerful side kick.  Marchant fell back against the rock wall of the gorge, all his strength spent, as Barrik, his full vitality returned, hit the misshapen beast with an incredible flurry of attacks.<br><br>Though it gave as good as it got, the minotaur was already badly wounded, and the Legionnaire pressed his advantage.  Even still, the great monster's fists and horns managed to take a heavy toll on him, and his newfound vigor began to wane.  As it swung a mighty fist at Barrik's head, a bright flash came from Barrik's axe, and a magical shield absorbed the impact.  When it looked at its hand in stunned surprise, the exhausted ranger drove Morin's sword deep into its heart.  With a final strangled cry, it fell to the ground in defeat.<br><br>Dropping to his knees, Barrik offered silent thanks to both Karana and Mithaniel Marr for their providence.  When he finished, he heard Marchant moving in front of him.<br><br>"Keep still," the paladin said quietly.  "Let me bind those wounds.  I have no mana left for healing, and we want to make the best of what you have."  Darkness descended completely as they tended to their wounds.  After the bandaging and healing was completed, they two exhausted half-elves made their way back to their camp.<br><br>Dawn broke too quickly, but sleep and spells had returned the two adventurers to full fighting trim.  Preparing to head off through the Runnyeye citadel towards Rivervale, Marchant asked Barrik, "Are you sure you don't want me to stay until your friend arrives?"<br><br>Barrik shook his head in the negative as he clasped the young paladin's hand. "No, that's all right.  He'll be here.  Fare well, my new friend.  May the Stormkeeper be between you and harm, in all the empty places you must walk."<br><br>Marchant saluted Barrik crisply.  "And may Mithaniel Marr's blessings be with you," he responded.  With that, he turned and walked down the tunnel.  <br><br>Barrik turned and faced the rising sun, and remembered his graying sight of the day before.  "They already have been, my friend.  They already have been."<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>"By the Stormkeeper, I think I've had enough blessings for one day," Barrik grumbled.  The clouds had rolled in shortly after he left Rivervale, and the rain had been coming down in torrents ever since.  The followers of Karana, of which Barrik was one, believed in the power of storms, and that rain brought life.  As such, storms were a blessing from their god.  The soaked ranger was all but completely waterlogged at this point however.  His cup was quite literally running over, and he was beginning to think there was such a thing as too many blessings.<br><br>In the dimming light, he was able to make out a small goblin encampment, and the cave entrance to Runnyeye Citadel.  He would need to sneak through there to get to the Gorge of King Xorbb.  Casting a spell of camouflage, he slowly snuck up on the goblin sentries, who he heard talking to each other in some incomprehensible tongue.  He was hard-pressed to think of another sound quite like it.  Gently flicking a pebble down the hill, he caused the sentries to both dash down to investigate.  While they did so, he quickly slipped past, into the goblin stronghold.<br><br>More horrific sounds reached his ears as he made his way through the caves of Runnyeye.  Screams, spell invocations, and the unmistakable squishing sound of the floating evil eyes.   He did not know why they chose, for the most part, to stay within the confines of Runnyeye and the Gorge, but it was something for which he was grateful.<br><br>By the time he had made it out the back entrance and into the gorge itself, night had fallen, and the rain had thankfully ended.  It had been a long, tiring trek, and he wanted to make camp and get some rest.  The problem was one of where to make his camp where he could hopefully remain undisturbed.  A short search brought him to a small cleft in the rock, in which he saw a small, well-hidden fire.  Tending the fire was a young half-elf in banded armor.<br><br>"Hail, brother," he called quietly. "I am Barrik Moonhunter, a ranger of the 7th Legion, and servant to Karana."<br><br>"Well met, Barrik Moonhunter. I am Marchant Braemar, paladin to Mithaniel Marr," came the reply.  "Would you care to partake of my fire?"<br><br>"Gladly, and many thanks."  Barrik sat down and pulled a small pot from his pack.  As the paladin looked on, he started to make some soup from foraged roots, meat, and vegetables.  As he waited for the pot to boil, he noticed Marchant repairing his armor. <br><br>"You do that with great skill," he observed.  "Are you perchance a blacksmith?"<br><br>"Yes," came the response. "I try to rely on my own abilities and the blessings of my god as much as possible.  I do not wish to be beholden to others."  He pointed out the rest of his armor.  "I made all of this myself."<br><br>"As for myself, I am a fletcher," Barrik offered.  He handed his carved elm bow to Marchant.  "This is an example of my work.  I could make you one, if you wish."<br><br>Marchant shook his head. "No, a bow would not be an honorable weapon for me.  I prefer to fight my enemies face-to-face."<br><br>Barrik cocked an eyebrow. "Any weapon that aids in the destruction of evil is honorable to me.  In any case, it's hard to hunt with a sword," he added with a grin.<br><br>A look of amusement came across the paladin's face, and he chuckled.  "True enough.  I never thought of that.  So what brings you to the Beholder's Maze, Barrik?"<br><br>"The halflings of Rivervale have asked for help fighting against the minotaurs, who have allied themselves with the goblins of Runnyeye.  They can handle the goblins, but are concerned the minotaurs may breach the Thicket wall.  I'm here to stop them from getting there."<br><br>"Alone? I would think that would be quite a challenge," Marchant observed. "Even for a Legionnaire."<br><br>"Well, I do have a partner in the fight," Barrik answered, as he offered Marchant some soup, and served himself some as well.  "He will not be able to join me until after the morrow.  He's still recovering from injuries from our last sojourn here.  I may be unable to do more than scout the area and pick off a single minotaur here and there."<br><br>Marchant thought about that, and his face steeled with resolve.  "No, I think you'll be able to do more than that."  He extended his hand towards the Legionnaire. "Your task is an honorable one.  I have a mission elsewhere, but it can wait for a short time.  If you wish, I will join you until your friend returns."<br><br>Barrik grasped the offered hand and shook it.  "I would be honored by your company, good paladin.  We should rest for now.  Tomorrow will be a busy day."<br><br>Together, they quickly cleaned up from their brief repast, and prepared to sleep.  Marchant took the first watch.  Exhaustion took hold of Barrik, and he quickly fell into a sound sleep.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Rising at the break of dawn comes naturally to those who call themselves rangers. In this, Barrik was no different from his brethren. He awoke as the sun's rays entered the window of his room, washed his face in the basin and quickly dressed.<br><br>Breakfast was simple, but hearty, as was his habit. Boiled milled grain with some dried fruit and honey satisfied his hunger, and he returned to his room to finish equipping his weapons and supplies. <br><br>Before leaving Rivervale, he looked in on his friend and compatriot Cona, who though he had already tended to his own wounds, would still need a day or so for the bones in his leg to fully knit. It seemed there were limits to what even the big shaman's skills could repair... Sometimes one still needed to rest.<br><br>Not that Cona wanted to admit it. "I'm fine, ready to go," he growled impatiently as he pushed aside his breakfast tray and tried to get up. <br><br>He almost made it all the way to his feet. Unfortunately, he neglected to consider the low ceiling of the halfling built inn. Hitting his head caused a sudden change in direction (from up to down,) and startled him to the point of making it impossible for him to hide the pain in his leg. Though it wasn't much, the wince on Cona's face was tantamount to a scream of agony from the normally stoic barbarian.<br><br>"Oh get back in bed, you're not fooling anyone," Barrik chided. "Next time a minotaur throws a boulder the size of a troll's head at you, just remember that trying to catch it and throw it back is probably not your best option."<br><br>"Hah!" Cona retorted. "The look of surprise on his face would have been worth it!"<br><br>Barrik considered that. "True," he admitted, "'would have been,' being the key."<br><br>The big shaman waved dismissively at his friend. "You have no sense of style," he grunted.<br><br>"I don't care about style. Right now, I care about dead minotaurs. Besides, style got you a broken leg, and two days in bed even after healing."<br><br>Cona feigned disgust and rolled over. "If you're going to give council like an old woman, I'm going back to sleep."<br><br>"And the light of reason dawns," Barrik teased. "Rest today. Head to the Gorge tomorrow. I'll meet you near the entrance to Runnyeye in two days time."<br><br>"Fine, off with you," the barbarian grumbled. "Try not to get eaten by goblins."<br><br>Barrik ducked out the door and left the inn, heading to the tunnel through the mountains that led to the Misty Thicket. Glancing skyward, he gauged the height of the sun. He would need to hurry to make it to the Gorge by nightfall. With grim determination he set out.  In the distance, black clouds rimmed the horizon, harbingers of things to come.<br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The sun was dropping between two peaks of the High Pass range as the young wood elf druid entered the gates of High Keep. Young being a relative term. The grandparents of the human Keep guards had not even been born when Mayne Ringjumper completed her first season of training. To their eyes, she appeared to be no older than twenty years. Yet for all her apparent youthfulness, there was a look in her expression that told the guards she was not one to trifle with. They silently kept their vigil as she walked past.<br><br>Mayne shook the dust of three continents from her cloak as she settled into her room at the inn. After a good meal and a hot bath, the chill had left her bones (the wind cutting through the pass was especially cold that afternoon.) Wrapped in a warm robe the innkeeper had provided, she poured herself a small glass of wine, and sat in a cushioned chair to read the reports she had gathered from the 7th Legion members throughout Norrath.<br><br>The first rays of the sun hit her eyes as dawn broke, waking her from a sound sleep. She looked down and saw the reports on the floor, the wine barely touched. "I should have known better," she thought. "These things always put me to sleep. At least the chair was comfortable."<br><br>After breakfast, she sought out Barrik Moonhunter, the Legionnaire assigned to the High Pass area. He hadn't been there the night before, and the night clerk didn't know his whereabouts. There was a different clerk there in the morning, and she decided to try again, hoping for better luck.<br><br>"Mr. Moonhunter?", the clerk asked. "He left yesterday morning with that Barbarian he hangs around with, said he likely wouldn't be back for a while." Noticing the Legion insignia on her cloak's clasp, he asked," You in the 7th Legion? He said someone from his guild might come lookng for him."<br><br>"Yes," Mayne replied. "My name is Mayne. Did he leave anything to pass on to the Legion?"<br><br>"He sure did, got it right here." Unlocking a heavy iron chest, the clerk pulled out an envelope, sealed with a symbol of a bow and arrow crossed over a cresent moon. He handed it to Mayne, who gave him a silver piece for his trouble.<br><br>"Thanks. I'll be back," she said over her shoulder as she went back to her room. Once there, she opened the envelope and examined the letter inside.<br><br>___<br><br>To: Council of Ten, 7th Legion<br>From: Barrik Moonhunter<br>Re: Status Report, High Pass<br><br>Councilors:<br><br>Activity of gnoll and orc populations in the area seems well in hand. A goodly number of adventurers and mercenaries has been keeping the vermin from endangering the residents of the pass and keep unduly. There is not a great deal I can add to their efforts.<br><br>The Mayor of Rivervale has sent a messenger to the Keep, seeking assistance. Runnyeye goblins have been terrorizing the halflings of late, and apparently have found allies in the minotaurs of the nearby Gorge of King Xorbb, which is known by some as the Beholder's Maze. <br><br>The halflings believe they can defend themselves against the goblins, but need the minotaurs stopped, as they believe the minotaurs may be able to breach the protective wall guarding the Misty Thicket. To that end, My compatriot Cona and I have agreed to travel to the gorge and attempt to halt the invasion of the great horned monstrosities. <br><br>By your leave, for the forseeable future I will make my base in Rivervale, though I have left word with the Bards of the Keep as to my whereabouts should my presence be required there.<br><br>It is my belief the danger to Rivervale is pressing, whilst High Pass at present seems in safe hands. Should the judgement of the council or the Caesar be otherwise, I submit myself to your justice.<br><br>In service to Karana, I remain,<br><br>Barrik Moonhunter, Legionary<br>C/O League of Antonican Bards, Rivervale<br><br>___<br><br>Mayne placed the report with the others, and jotted down a note supporting the judgement of the Half-elf ranger. (Being Consul of State, she felt safe speaking for the council.) She gave it to the clerk as she checked out of the inn, and exited the gates of the High Keep. Summoning the forces of nature about her, she opened a gate to another part of the world. "Next stop, Toxxulia Forest," she called out to the young guard at the gate, "Serving Erudin, Paineel, Erud's Crossing, and Kerra Island. Keep your feet inside the gate, and please don't feed the kobolds."<br><br>The guard looked at her, head cocked to one side. As the shimmering gate closed about her, she gave him a mischevous grin and a wink. With a bright flash, she was gone, leaving behind only a twinkling of light, and the echoes of her laughter.<br><br>-----<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>At the High Keep Inn, Barrik answered the knock at the door, to find a comely young girl standing there.  The innkeeper&#8217;s daughter, he guessed.  &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he said with a smile.<br><br>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Moonhunter,&#8221; she replied.  &#8220;You wanted us to make sure you were up by 8?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, thank you,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Excuse me," he said as he turned his head back into his room and called out loudly,   &#8220;Cona, get your Barbarian butt out of bed! We're wasting daylight!"<br><br>The girl heard grumbling and muffled groaning, as though a pillow covered the speaker&#8217;s head.  She couldn&#8217;t make out the words.  Barrik had no such problem.<br><br>"Well, maybe if you hadn't had those last half-dozen Halas Heaters, your head wouldn't hurt quite so much."<br><br>The moaning continued, much to the ranger&#8217;s amusement.<br><br>"It is NOT a religious requirement. You clear your head, I'm going to check the mail."<br><br>Giving a silver piece to the innkeeper&#8217;s daughter, Barrik walked down to the High Keep courtyard to see if the fellow from the League of Antonican Bards had any news from his nephews.<br><br>"Good day to you, Mr. Moonhunter," said the young bard at the post. <br><br>&#8220;Well met, lad,&#8221; Barrik responded.  &#8220;What news?&#8221;<br><br>"Something came in for you last night." The bard shuffled through his bag, and pulled out an envelope, containing the seal of Fortenbras Oberonis, Caesar of the 7th Legion. "It looks pretty official."<br><br>With a slight amount of trepidation, Barrik opened the envelope. "Reassigned already? But I just -got- here," he grumbled. "Ah well, " he sighed, "after honor, comes duty. Might as well see where I'm headed next. Though Cona's going to be madder than a wet Kerran at having to move so soon."<br><br>He unfolded the parchment and began to read...<br><br>============<br><br>Hail, Legionnaire! The council of the 7th sends its greetings and congratulations on attaining your 20th season. <br><br>Your efforts in battling the undead hordes in the Desert of Ro and the Marr Oasis have not gone unnoticed.

He made his way back to the Inn. "Just what Cona needs, another reason to hoist a flagon or twelve.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Note:<br><br>The 7th Legion's command structure is much like the Roman military.  The leader of the guild is called the Caesar, or occasionally, Elder.  The officers are called Centurions, and each has his or her own area of responsibility - recruiter, jurist, politico, et cetera.  At the time of this writing, the Caesar of the 7th Legion was Fortenbras Oberonis, a Shaman of Halas.<br><br>------------<br><br>The door to the 7th Legion soldier's barracks opened, and a cold blast of frigid air followed.  A hooded man in a white, ice-encrusted bearskin cloak stood framed in the doorway.  As Scei and Gilgazin looked up from their drinks at the great table, he closed the door behind him, and hung the cloak on a wooden peg on the wall, revealing himself to be a slightly-built Erudite in brown robes.<br><br>"What's the matter, you two?" Arjaizen grinned.  "Did you get kicked out of every tavern in Halas?"<br><br>"Arj!" Scei shouted.  "What're you doing back here?  I thought you were in Freeport."<br><br>"I was," Arjaizen admitted. "But I grew tired of that place.  It's too hot, too dry, and too crowded.  I'm not sure where I'm going to go next.  Perhaps back to Erudin for a while.  It's been a long time since I was home.<br><br>"So why are you two here instead of out on the town?"<br><br>Scei grinned, and hoisted her flagon.  "No need.  Gil got a care package from Kaladim.  Dwarven Ripple!"<br><br>"Ah, I see.  Don't pay for what you can get for free." Arjaizen replied, turning to the young Dwarf.  "So, good cleric, do you think you might spare a drop for a chilled comrade-in-arms?"<br><br>"Glad ta, my friend," Gilgazin offered cheerily.  "Got plenty ta go 'round."<br><br>As he poured a flagon of the strong Dwarven brew, he asked, "Hey, 'd you two hear 'bout Amberrious?  Seems some wizard sent a letter to the Caesar, saying he oughtta be reprimanded fer bein' rough with him."<br><br>"Amberrious?  The paladin?"  Arjaizen looked astounded. "I find that hard to believe.  There must be more to the story."<br><br>"Sure is," Gilgazin agreed. "The wizard made fun 'o his name.  Said it was funny soundin', or sumthin' like that.  Then, he sez in th' letter that Amberrious was angry and threatnin'."<br><br>"And this came as a surprise?  Such that he deemed it necessary to complain to the Caesar himself?" Arjaizen asked.<br><br>"Musta been an Erudite," Scei muttered into her drink.  "Buncha prisses make High Elves seem like tavern wenches."  She looked at Arjaizen.  "No offense."<br><br>"None taken, my dear," Arjaizen answered.  "I am well aware that my brethren can be somewhat lacking in social graces, and that they often believe an air of haughty superiority will give them the appearance of intellectual agility."<br><br>"Yeah," Scei replied, wiping her mouth on her sleeve.  "And they think bein' rude makes 'em look smart, too."<br><br>"Indeed," the Erudite grinned.<br><br>"Tell me Arj," Gilgazin asked, "Do ya think Elder Fortenbras'll come down on Amberrious?"<br><br>Arjaizen shook his head.  "If the story is as simple as you say, I doubt it.  If what you say is true, the young wizard apparently admitted he started the whole thing.  How foolish must one be to insult the name of a stranger?  After doing so, what kind of reaction was he expecting?"<br><br>Scei belched loudly. "Amberrious should've punched his lights out.  I would've."<br><br>"And therein lies the warrior's charm, my dear," Arjaizen smiled, sipping his drink.  "But paladins are held to a more... restrained standard.  I suspect he has more to worry about from his order than from the Guild."<br><br>"So, my friends, tell me what else has been going on in Halas since I left..."<br><br>As the fire burned and the drink flowed, the conversation went long into the night...<br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>

My "first born" and primary character.  Thought to be quite insane by some of his race.  Outgoing, affable, and a jokester.  Loves drinking with his Barbarian friends.  Like I said, insane.<br><br>Barrik Moonhunter, Ranger of Surefall.  My highest level character.  Perhaps he should be thought of as a co-primary.  Firm believer in honor and duty.<br><br>Gilgazin, Cleric of Kaladim.  Rough around the edges, but with a heart of gold.<br><br>Scei, Warrior of Halas.  Originally my RL daughter's character, I took her over when I got my daughter her own account. (Didn't have the heart to delete her.)  More guts than a disemboweled hill giant, will dismiss brutal injury as "just a scratch,"<br><br>Bejaizen, Paladin of Erudin.  The son of Arjaizen. Respects his father, but is often embarassed by him.  Much more of a traditional Erudite than his father.<br><br>My RL daughter also plays, and has a couple of characters I might include from time to time.  They are:<br><br>Euara, Wizard of Erudin.  Daughter of Arjaizen, sister to Bejaizen<br><br>Shaye, Warrior of Halas.  Sister (more like "clone",) of Scei.  This is who she created first when she got her own account.  I gave all Scei's items to her, so getting Shaye to where Scei was wouldn't be quite so painful.  Hey, my kid earned it the first time around. :-)<br><br>All of these characters are members in the 7th Legion.  I hope you enjoy the chronicles of their adventures.<br><br>-Arj<br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>21st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Centurion Politico, 7th Legion</td></tr>
