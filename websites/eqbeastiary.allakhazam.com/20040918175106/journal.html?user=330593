After you left Veld, everyone agreed to do BCNM tonight. We're all aware it'll be a late night and I got in touch with Sqwert and who said he'd be free and to give a shout when we're getting ready.

I have 170k in the bank as of this morning, which means I will shortly have Mary's Horn. I'm writing this up as best I can and am asking each of you to come here and read and discuss our plans. There is a lot to cover all aspects of the battle.<br><br><b>Introduction</b><br>BCNM 40 - Steamed Sprouts is a 6 vs 8 battle with a 30 minute time limit. Practically every strategy for this battle revolves around the Horde Lullabye Bard song. This allows the party to focus it's efforts on one mob at a time with relative safety. Most strategies out there outline a party more or less like this: Bard, Bard's healer, Melee/Tank, Melee, Melee, Melee's healer. We, however, don't have the luxury of 2nd healer within our linkshell. Lucky for us, people have demonstrated that this battle is easily doable without the aid of a 2nd healer.<br><br><b>The good guys</b><br>Anuule - Elvaan - White Mage<br>Atill - Elvaan - Samurai<br>Munnin - Galka - Bard<br>Sandroi - Elvaan - Paladin<br>Sinius - Hume - Dark Knight<br>Velderin - Elvaan - Thief<br><br><b>The bad guys</b><br><u><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/db/bestiary.html?fmob=53 target=akztarg>Dvorovoi</a></u><br><u><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/db/bestiary.html?fmob=70 target=akztarg>Domovoi</a></u> x 7<br><br><b>Strategy</b><br>Strategy is broken down by role:<br>Bard - <span style='color: yellow;'><i>Sleep</i></span style='color: yellow;'> the domovoi, <span style='color: yellow;'><i>tank</i></span style='color: yellow;'> as they wake up, <span style='color: yellow;'><i>heal bard</i></span style='color: yellow;'>, and <span style='color: yellow;'><i>buff</i></span style='color: yellow;'> himself and white mage<br>White Mage - Primary: <span style='color: yellow;'><i>Heal bard</i></span style='color: yellow;'>; Secondary: Assist <span style='color: yellow;'><i>heal melee</i></span style='color: yellow;'> if necessary<br>Paladin - <span style='color: yellow;'><i>Tank</i></span style='color: yellow;'> and <span style='color: yellow;'><i>heal melee</i></span style='color: yellow;'> (do what a paladin does best), <span style='color: yellow;'><i>pull</i></span style='color: yellow;'>, and <span style='color: yellow;'><i>kill</i></span style='color: yellow;'><br>Thief - Assist paladin with <span style='color: yellow;'><i>pull</i></span style='color: yellow;'> (SATA) and <span style='color: yellow;'><i>kill</i></span style='color: yellow;'><br>Dark Knight - <span style='color: yellow;'><i>Stun</i></span style='color: yellow;'> and <span style='color: yellow;'><i>kill</i></span style='color: yellow;'><br>Samurai - <span style='color: yellow;'><i>Kill!!</i></span style='color: yellow;'> <span style='color: yellow;'><i>Kill!!</i></span style='color: yellow;'> <span style='color: yellow;'><i>Kill!!</i></span style='color: yellow;'><br><br><span style='color: yellow;'><i>Sleep</i></span style='color: yellow;'> is accomplished via the song horde lullabye. With Mary's Horn most domovoi should sleep nearly 30 seconds. People write that that is usually long enough to get in a cure and buffing song -or two. Note: It is generally held among bards that more charisma = less early wakers -or put another way, less partial resists.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'><i>Tank</i></span style='color: yellow;'> Both the bard and paladin are tanks in this battle. Obviously so in the paladin's case. The bard will be taking a beating during each bout of sleep as the domovoi wake up. Both the bard and paladin will want to use fishkabobs or crab for the defensive boosts.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'><i>Heal</i></span style='color: yellow;'> requires MP. This is a long battle and MP regeneration is a must. There are three ways to get that. Mages ballad, drinks, and resting. The bard should attempt to keep ballad (outlined in the buffing section) on himself and the white mage at all times. Additionally, each member with healing responsibilities must bring several drinks (juice, yagudo) and the white mage should definitely eat MP+ food (pumpkin or rolanberry pie). Lastly, after healing the bard from the latest bout of sleeping, the white mage can get in a tick or two of rest to regain MP. The white mage <u>must</u> give priority to the bard. -If the bard dies, everyone will die. It is possible that a melee might die, yet get a raise later in the battle when only a couple of domovoi remain.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'><i>Buff</i></span style='color: yellow;'> in between bouts of sleeping, the bard should attempt to keep up Minne and Ballad. Staggering these every other bout should allow for enough time to cast a cure or two while waiting for the domovoi to wake.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'><i>Pull</i></span style='color: yellow;'> early in the battle it won't be too difficult to wake up and pull the domovoi away from the bard, but as the bard generates increasing hate via sleeping and curing himself it will be very difficult to do. This is where the time-honored combo of thief+tank come into play. The thief will use SATA off the paladin along with the paladin's provoke to pull. -It'll be handy that all the domovoi will be facing the bard, taking full advantage of both sneak and trick attack. It is critical to wake and pull each successive domovoi as quickly and as far away as possible to prevent it from using dream flower while within range of the bard and his healer.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'><i>Stun</i></span style='color: yellow;'> will save the battle. Flood may kill (if we're lucky with the pre-battle buffs, it won't, but let's not risk it) the paladin. Unresisted it almost certainly will. Once the dvorovoi begins to cast the ancient magic Flood, several people should hit a macro that does a &lt;call&gt; to make sure the dark knight stuns him first. If for some reason the dark knight can't cast stun, there is enough time for the paladin to unlock and run out of range to interrupt the dvorovoi's casting.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'><i>Kill!!</i></span style='color: yellow;'> to kill them as quickly as possible, we should work out some skillchains. The listing for the domovoi says they are weak to dark, fire, ice, lightning, wind and are based on earth. Lots of potential there for skillchains. Those killing, but not tanking should definitely bring some mithkabobs.<br><br><b>Pre-battle</b><br>Buff:<br>White mage: Protectra and Shellra II. Eat food. Rest to full. Bard: March and Minuet for the melee. White mage: Barwatera -in case of flood going off at the very start (people report that it has happened) and Barparalyzra to help shorten how long the melee will be paralyzed when the Dvorovoi uses paralyzga.<br><br>Engage:<br>Bard sleeps Dvorovoi. Once Domovoi move to engage the bard, the melee move to engage the sleeping Dvorovoi. The bard retreats somewhat so that the white mage has room between the bard and the melee. The bard sings Horde Lullabye and begins cycle of self-curing and alternating Ballad and Minne II between bouts of sleeping Domovoi with Horde Lullabye. At this beginning stage, it is important for the white mage to stay next to the bard in case Horde Lullabye misses any. They will aggro the healer and move so that they are all within range of the next Horde Lullabye.<br><br><b>Mid-battle</b><br>Try to keep the current melee target away from the sleeping bunch so as to avoid the bard and/or the bard's white mage from getting put to sleep with dream flower. Melee isn't such a worry, but may still consider using a poison potion so that the sleep won't stick longer than a tick. Yet, melee shouldn't fight so far away that the white mage can't easily throw in a quick emergency cure should she get the chance and be needed.<br>Flood = really bad, but luckily only the dvorovoi uses it.<br>Healers drink a juice/yag drink as MP is getting to half way.<br>Dead bard = game over man, game over!<br><br><b>Post-battle</b><br>How to divide the spoils. a) Player that uses their orb for the battle gets all the items from that battle. b) Sell all items and divide the spoils evenly. c) Give requested items to those who need them and divide the rest evenly.<br><br><b>Study materials</b><br>Reading:<br><u><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/db/quests.html?fquest=331 target=akztarg>Balga's Dais BCNM 40 - Steamed Sprouts</a></u> quest page<br><u><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/db/jobs.html?fjob=9&amp;mid=1086107705752201337&amp;num=111 target=akztarg>titanmahler's BCNM 40 Giddeus Complete Guide</a></u><br><u><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/db/jobs.html?fjob=9&amp;mid=10929276617981785&amp;num=21 target=akztarg>BCNM 40 Help</a></u> is one of the better threads (Bard centric) about all things related to this BCNM<br><br>Video:<br><u><a href=HTTP://128.135.31.47/BCNM40.wmv target=akztarg>BCNM40.wmv</a></u> <b>52 Megs</b> and about 20 minutes of a full battle <span class=sm>(I really have to add that a number of bards used terms such as 'noob' and 'loser' in describing the bard in this battle.

First, to clarify the plans:<br><br>Thursday: Our first go at this. This is going to be solely linkshell with Dworkin as our white mage and me playing the part of the Hot Shot Bard that's Incredibly Tough. :) Note, we won't be starting this until fairly late. I am not sure what time zone Alaska falls into, but Velderin can't start until after 10pm.<br><br>Saturday: A white mage that I've partied with and has a good reputation, Sqwert (how cute is that name?), has accepted my invite. He also has red mage high enough in level to use that, too, so that may be an option to consider following Thursday's battles.<br><br>Munnin has informed me that he will be away (in paradise, the rat bastard) till or through Sunday. I don't know if we want to plan on doing it again Sunday or not until we see how well we do.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'>Velderin</span style='color: yellow;'>:<br>We talked last night, so I think you're clear regarding how you'll be using SATA to help Sandroi pull the domovoi from the bard. I don't know how long it'll take for you four to kill each, but I imagine that it'll be wise to not use SATA except for pulling till we get a feel for the rhythm?<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'>Sandroi</span style='color: yellow;'>:<br>Please be sure to read titanmahler's guide that I have linked above. He talks about the paladin concentrating more on MP gear, since you'll be doing a lot of curing and only tanking one mob at a time. In this case, while I'm bard, you're welcome to borrow those MP pieces that I'm not using: electrum ring, electrum hairpin, and holy phial. Do you have any of your RSE? The gloves,&nbsp;&nbsp;legs, and boots all have nice MP on them.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'>Melee</span style='color: yellow;'>:<br>Skillchains! Sorry, Velderin, I missed earlier that you said you'd be looking into them.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'>Munnin</span style='color: yellow;'>:<br>Thanks for the input, which I'm interested in particularly for your experience in the battle already. I have a couple of thoughts.. First, by the time we get around to doing the battle together, I'll have equipment that you can borrow (Elegant Shield and Corsette +1) that will give you another +2 CHR. I know it's hard to trade off MP and CHR in your case, but you could also use my Noble's Ribbon which is another +3. I'm also buying gear with the max defense in those slots that lack CHR gear at 40. This, then, segues into the topic of food.. It's pretty standard in everything I read that the bard also use a tank's food. Boiled Crab: Def +21.9%, +4 VIT or Fish mithkabob: Def +25.4%, +2 VIT. Combined with Minne, wouldn't you be taking significantly less damage? The bard in the full video above is getting hit for 24 points. If you really wanted to, now that the Etudes have change, you could choose to boost your CHR instead of defense that way? Food for thought. In the coming days I plan on using fish mithkabobs and keeping Minne and Ballad on me at all times.<br><br>You also got me daydreaming about a two bard party. I haven't thought it through completely yet and I have come up with some potention pitfalls, but the idea is really intriguing.. Pre-battle, buff the melee with March, Madrigal, Minuet I, Minuet II. Bard 1 goes to sleep the Dvorovoi, bard 2 begins singing Minne II, and the melee advance to engage the sleeping Dvorovoi. Bard 1 runs back to Bard 2 and Horde Lullabye's the Domovoi while Bard 2 cures. Once the Domovoi are asleep, the bards together do some healing and then sing Ballad and Mambo. (Hmm, stack Minne I in there then?) This is the point where I get sketchy.. The melee will maul the Dvorovoi with the double song buffing I hope. Bard 2 can potentially start sleep early wakers. I would worry about their sleep cycle getting wildly random.. Would two Foe Lullabye's and two Horde Lullabye's be enough to keep them tamed despite differing sleep lengths and early wakers? Once we've got some experience I wonder if this would end up working better? Shoot, my Paeon II and III stacked give 6 HP per tick. Lots of unanswered (and wholly unqualified at the moment) questions atm. I must concentrate on the task at hand.<br><br>For the upcoming battles where I will be playing the part of the Hot Shot Bard that is Incredibly Tough, my to do:<br><br>Buy: corsette +1, some +3 evasion back item (or perhaps borrow? anyone? anyone?), Royal squire's robe, fish mithkabobs, and assorted juices and potions.<br><br><span style='color: yellow;'>Spoils</span style='color: yellow;'>:<br>If it's only linkshell members, like Thursday, I have no problem with people getting the scrolls they need. We're here to help each other like that. Once we all have what we need for our jobs we can begin selling and splitting the profits. However, once we start mixing it up with non-link people, that isn't necessarily fair. They might agree to that or they might want to get an equal part somehow. Either we sell it all and everyone gets Gil or we figure out the value of particular items and try to splite them evenly. Keep in mind, there's no need to feel stingy.. Once we have this down, we'll have plenty of opportunity to get all that we desire.<br><br>WT aka Anuule<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Wed Sep 15 13:25:33 2004 by wickedtribe</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?12670 target=akztarg><u><b>Anuule</b></u></a> - Elvaan - Child of Altana - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal.html?user=330593 target=akztarg><u>The Misadventures of Anuule</u></a><br>Rank 5, 41 BRD, 40 WHM, 25 THF 22 RDM, 20 BLM, 12 NIN, 11 PLD, 10 WAR, 10 RNG, 8 BST<br>AF1 (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - Mary's Horn (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - BCNM 40 (<span style='color: orange;'><b>0:0</b></span style='color: orange;'>)</td></tr>

( this gives you more time to heal up between attacks ) after the level cap i have about 60-62 chr, i can eat some caviar or enchant etude to get to 68 or so ). you should keep your armor and try to get 65 chr yourself. if you're my healer you'll be standing next to me and could sleep the random white that wakes up. or you could stand by melee. buff melee and sleep the random white that escapes my aoe and runs to the melee fight. this fight should really be cake with 2 bards, even w/o mary's horn. (=<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the way i know this fight to work is to have 2 healers, one bard, and 3 melee. at the start of the fight everyone buffs up and the bard runs to the arena's edge first, the bard's healer stands on the ramp.<br><br>  once the bard is in the arena the bard sleeps the black sprout in the center. this sends all the whites on the bard. the bard runs out of the arena, half way down the ramp ( or at the bottom of the ramp ) where you came in and horde sleeps the whites. the bard is going to get hit pretty hard [ ( 30+ dmg x 6 sprouts)/tick]. so the bard's healer has to be on the ball with the heal good juice. once the whites are asleep then things calm down a bit. bard can cast any buffs needed ( i generally do ballad + enchant etude. ) melee run in and everyone gets into position. one healer by the bard, one healer by the melee. <br><br>  it's important for people to stay in place. melee in the center arena and bard way out of the fight. while the melee attacks the black sprout, the whites will wake up randomly or all at once. if you get attacked, let the bard pull it back to the group of whites and sleep it. don't run around once you're in the fight. generally, if you keep the white sprouts away from the black sprout fight they'll stick to hating the bard.<br><br>  after the black sprout beat down ( watch out for floods ) have one puller grab a white sprout from the sleep pen. they'll go down a bit faster than the black one. bard just keeps on sleeping whites until the last one falls. </p>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

But I need to rant/think out loud and would appreciate anyone's thoughts that feels like reading. Maybe I'll rewrite it in the near future in Anuule's voice.<br><br>I've been kinda ... lost, lately. When I first started playing, my goal was to be a bard. I love playing support roles and the thought of helping the others do what they do better was very appealing to me. I levelled white mage to 18. Black mage up to 17 for warp. Thief to 18 somewhere in there.. When I made it to 30 with white mage, I quickly ran out and got beast master, ranger, and bard. Bard was ok.. I think it was fun more for the fact that during my stint in the dunes, I was very proactive with my parties and made them all myself. I remember fondly an awesome party midday, once, that was all JP. Once I reached level 20, however, I was not having fun.. -I think it was because I didn't feel like I was contributing much. The bard job is like that, I think. You don't see too much directly that you can point to and say 'I did that.' People can say 'I love bards' all they want, and it is nice, but I still don't manage to see much that makes me happy. I sold all of my instruments and went back to white mage with the teleport spells as my goal.<br><br>Going to back to white mage was a lot of fun. And once I hit 36 I went a hunting for my tele-scrolls. -Thankfully they're pretty easy to get as a white mage. Thank you Squenix! At this point I took a break. My black mage sub was underlevelled at 36 and I needed to upgrade equipment and spells. I played around a little with paladin and ranger and ninja. When a real life buddy of mine was near my bard's level, I even bought all my instruments again to level up with him so he could hit 30 and start working for some advanced jobs. I quickly found partying for the two of us was a pain in the ass, since it's really, really hard to find pickup parties that would have room for both a white mage and a thief. Back to making my own parties again. -After a while a person gets tired of always putting together a party and being the responsible person. It's kinda funny, yet sad, that we got within spitting distance of 30 and we ran out of juice. I had work travel for a week at a time and shortly after that two weeks of vacation away from the PS2. (He recently mostly solo'd -sometimes with help from me- up to 30. Hurray!)<br><br>Instead of finishing up that last 3000 xp or so, I was struck by the idea of starting red mage so that the two of us could duo later on down the road. I levelled up red mage from 0 to 20 and also brought up my black mage job to 20, also. It sure is sad, even when I'm relatively well pimped out, as an elvaan to see sooo many nukes get resisted. -It's even worse when you're partied with a taru black mage and see his nukes kicking butt. (I would find joy in those rare instances where one of his nukes would be resisted.. lol, sad, but true. &quot;Haha! See how it feels!&quot;) It was around this time that I was feeling pretty darn low as an Elvaan. I was considering turning to paladin simply because it seemed to me to be the only job to which an elvaan was naturally inclined. &gt;,&lt; This was sad, because I was really enjoying being a red mage. I went all out.. I made macros to switch out eq to specialize for melee, black, or white magic. I 'know' that things get better. Shoot, at level 20 a bunch of +INT gear is available, for example. But sometimes 'knowing' isn't enough. One has to believe.<br><br>Recently, I've played a bit of the beastmaster, which seems like great fun. It reminds me why I love playing necromancers in diablo 2. ;) I got thief up to level 20, also, as a way of making some gil. Even in some partying, I enjoyed that. I had a LOT of fun playing red mage/ninja with two enthundered weapons. I already have enblizzard (lvl 22) purchased from early on in anticipation of using it to hunt air elementals.<br><br>I think it's abundantly clear that I have trouble focusing at times. I have an awesome linkshell for the cool friends that I've made, but we don't play together very much. -And that's mostly my own fault. I've always been busy or not in the mood. Despite that, I don't think I'd ever trade in my linkshell. In reviewing my FFXI career, I have to say the most fun I have had has been playing as my white mage and red mage.. So I gotta stick to em.<br><br>Continue to level black mage till 30 or so, so that I have plenty of room for advancement as white mage with the black mage sub. I'm not sure if my affinity for red mage would ever translate from soloing into party play. But if it ever should, black mage and white mage would be there for subbing. And for the solo efforts, I'll keep ninja and thief levelled up.<br><br>Yeah, that's the ticket.</p>&nbsp;<br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?12670 target=akztarg><u><b>Anuule</b></u></a> - Elvaan - Child of Altana - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal.html?user=330593 target=akztarg><u>The Misadventures of Anuule</u></a><br>Rank 5, 41 BRD, 40 WHM, 25 THF 22 RDM, 20 BLM, 12 NIN, 11 PLD, 10 WAR, 10 RNG, 8 BST<br>AF1 (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - Mary's Horn (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - BCNM 40 (<span style='color: orange;'><b>0:0</b></span style='color: orange;'>)</td></tr>

Despite adventuring with many red mages in the past, I'd never taken the time to learn what it was like to be one. Nor had the thought ever occurred to me that I might be interested in being one myself.<br><br>Going back a little bit, to a time shortly before that fateful meeting, I had been feeling particularly directionless. I love being a white mage, sure, but after questing for the first set of teleport scrolls, I needed a break. I also needed to practice my black mage job some, as my skills as a white mage had finally exceeded my limited abilities as a black mage. In the subsequent weeks I worked at many new jobs and found them all unsatisfying for one reason or another. I even picked up the instruments again -after a not insignificant investment in new instruments, since I had sold the old ones when I had previously sworn off the way of the bard. This allowed me to adventure with Annise again, which was fun, when we weren't struggling to find a group of people that either had space for or would join us. I even found the job enjoyable, especially once I learned to sing the mana regenerating ballad for mages.<br><br>So I began to consider taking up the red mage job. The red mage is truly a jack of all trades, which befits my limited attention span. While master of none, a red mage is often the most capable of all jobs while adventuring alone in the wilderness. A red mage job would be perfect for those times when Annise and I are adventuring alone. Healing? CHECK. Buffing? CHECK. Debuffing? CHECK. Nuking? CHECK. Awesome weapon enhancing spells? DOUBLE CHECK. Count me in!! I couldn't understand why I hadn't thought of this before.<br><br>My early experience with red mage was very similar to any of the other jobs I had taken up. Red mage was decidedly easier, though, as I had access to useful healing and protecting spells sooner than almost every other time balanced with a respectable ability to solo. It was especially nice that most of my skills as a red mage benefited from my experience with my other jobs, especially white mage and thief. With no trouble, I quickly reached the point where I needed to join others to continue gaining experience. That experience was a mixed bag, though.<br><br>It is well known that Elvaan tend to not make natural red and black mages. It takes considerable investment in equipment to be as capable as most others are with minimal gear. This was a burden I was willing and determined to bear. -Or so I thought. I was disappointed to find that many of the monsters we fought in Valkurm Dunes were often able to shrug off my spells. Though noone said anything to me at the time, I still felt as if I was not pulling my weight as well as I should. -Yet I didn't have gil enough to afford better equipment. I was quite distraught and didn't know what I should do for a while there. Somehow I managed to keep motivated and did the best I could do for the parties that would have me. I slowly managed to learn what it means to be a red mage. With that realization, I returned to San d'Oria to switch out my black mage gear for white mage and returned to capitalize on my proven ability to healer and not worry too much for my offensive abilities.<br><br>After a couple of days, I am no longer as depressed with my new job as I was then. I realize that as I continue to grow and gain experience, I'll be able to find additional equipment to enhance my limited natural offensive abilities. This will in fact be helpful for when I turn once again to my black mage job. In fact, I am excited. In the near the future I'll gain the ability to use spells that will enhance my weapons with elemental auras. I have, in fact, already purchased the scrolls in my anticipation. I cannot wait to be able to utilize my ninja skills so that I can wield two fast daggers. Once enhanced with an ice element, they'll tear through air elementals, which are weak to ice damage. I cannot wait. &lt;evil grin&gt;<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Thu Jul 22 14:19:52 2004 by wickedtribe</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?12670 target=akztarg><u><b>Anuule</b></u></a> - Elvaan - Child of Altana - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal.html?user=330593 target=akztarg><u>The Misadventures of Anuule</u></a><br>Rank 5, 41 BRD, 40 WHM, 25 THF 22 RDM, 20 BLM, 12 NIN, 11 PLD, 10 WAR, 10 RNG, 8 BST<br>AF1 (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - Mary's Horn (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - BCNM 40 (<span style='color: orange;'><b>0:0</b></span style='color: orange;'>)</td></tr>

The pattern we have going is to party in the jungles around Kazham and when done I'll switch to my white mage job and teleport Annise back to La Theine Plateau, so that she only has to make the trek between San d'Oria and Kazham 1-ish times everyday. I'll then use my black mage job to warp back whenever I need to return.<br><br>Well, last night, Annise didn't show up till a little later in the evening and I decided to skip the levelling for the night and go to Giddeus to farm the hapless Yagudo for their necklaces. -Truly, they are not hapless.. They posess an intelligence and evil-purpose, I am sure, that the Taru-taru have so far refused to acknowledge. The people of Windurst continue to believe that their 'peaceful coexistance' is a reality, when it is only a facade that the Yagudo have built to lull them them into a false sense of security.<br><br>While taking my supper in the comfort of my house in San d'Oria, and shortly after talking with Annise, there was a knock on my door. A warrior I had partied with not so long ago (Altana forgive me, his name fails me at the moment..) stopped by to ask for my assistance. It seems he was in need of an escort to Davoi to retrieve a report from a knight there. I have been to Giddeus three times at this point and recall, also, my and Annise's cursed trip to Xarcabard.. I think he could see the uneasiness in my eyes and said it was no problem at all if I was too busy. I told him to come back in a short while, to allow me to finish my dinner and consider things. I knew I was still much too weak to handle the orcs that populate that outpost. I have heard of incidents where those possessing significantly more experience than I being cut down by the bow-wielding Farkillers. I prayed to Altana and felt a sense of calm and knew that I should help him. It is what Altana wanted me to do. It is, after all, my purpose to serve others.<br><br>I informed the warrior that I would help him and we met up shortly afterwards to head out. I teleported us to the Holla tele-point in La Theine to shorten our trip. (He enjoyed the ride.. I wonder if it was his first. It made me smile to see the joy and wonder in his eyes.) After a short ride on chocobo, we arrived at Davoi and located the knight just inside the entrance. I was amazed and thankful for our stroke of luck until he told us that he was missing a page, which he lost when fleeing from the orcs in the area ahead. In a moment of inspiration, I devised a plan to take advantage of my ability to remain invisible up until the moment that I cast a spell. I would cloak our presence from the orcs with invisible, and once he located the page, I would immediately begin teleporting us. This would allow him a few moments to grab the page and would leave him visible only for a short time, until we were teleported out of the outpost. Indeed, when we found the page with three orcs nearby, I was thankful that we had a good plan. He took only a few hits and managed to successfully able to grab the page.<br><br>Once safe in La Theine again, we parted ways, as he needed to return to that knight in Davoi to retrieve the rest of the report and I was headed to Giddeus. After a quick warp to Kazham to have a moogle help me switch to my thief subjob, I teleported to Tahrongi Canyon and rented a chocobo to travel to Giddeus. I take a certain thrill in the fact that I, a white mage, can now walk throughout Giddeus without a care. They have learned that I am not to be troubled with.. But it is easy to incite them, and once I anger one, the others quickly follow suit. I use this behavior to my advantage as I gather groups of them together and use my staves to call upon the power of the earth to crush them all.<br><br>Eventually I could hold no more necklaces -they're quite cumbersome!- and gave them to Nanaa Mihgo in Windurst Woods. -With her influence, I'll eventually be able to return to Norg and quest for several ninja spells. To judge how much progress I had made thus far, I travelled to Jeuno and stopped in at the inn that is rumored to be run by the Tenshodo. I sigh when I see that their prices are still somewhat high. Word of my deeds obviously hadn't travelled very far. I determined to return to Giddeus to continue my hunting. Before I leave, though, I stop by the auction house with hope that someone has finally made some elm poles. Bingo! Hurray! I gladly give the staff 4000 gil for one of the poles. While my attack will be somewhat slower with this heavier weapon, the nearly doubled damage over my best staff will certainly make up for it. Even luckier was bumping into someone who was willing to give me 1000gil simply for teleporting to where I was going anyway! -Though I didn't tell him that. ;) Effectively the pole only cost me 3000. I couldn't believe my luck. Certainly, Altana must be rewarding me for my selfless acts earlier.<br><br>I strode into Giddeus, approached the first Yagudo I saw and <i>Lo! I laid the smack down!</i> The improvement in damage is amazing. Not only that, but I was also building up more tactical energy with each hit so that I could call upon my weapon skills more frequently. I effortlessly cut down Yagudo after Yagudo. It was a bloody and gory business, but at the rate those beasts multiply, if it weren't for adventurers like myself, Windurst would be quickly overrun. As I was about to leave the area, I met a Taru bard, Makado, who was also gathering necklaces so that he could practice his clothcraft. We both finished off the night walking back to Windurst together chatting and sharing stories.<br><br>I believe he'll be a good friend.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Wed Jul 14 11:42:50 2004 by wickedtribe</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?12670 target=akztarg><u><b>Anuule</b></u></a> - Elvaan - Child of Altana - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal.html?user=330593 target=akztarg><u>The Misadventures of Anuule</u></a><br>Rank 5, 41 BRD, 40 WHM, 25 THF 22 RDM, 20 BLM, 12 NIN, 11 PLD, 10 WAR, 10 RNG, 8 BST<br>AF1 (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - Mary's Horn (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - BCNM 40 (<span style='color: orange;'><b>0:0</b></span style='color: orange;'>)</td></tr>

She seems determined to settle for nothing less than hearing her name spoken by none less than the king! I, being a supportive friend, have agreed to help her as best I can. Surely becoming well known can only help me in my efforts to serve the Goddess Altana.<br><br>We had done several quests together when we decided that we would assist knights with a supply run to one of our outposts to which we had not visited before. -Who knows when being able to quickly teleport to one of these regions might come in handy? Considering the list of outposts, we pick one that seems relatively nearby. 'Xarcabard?', I say, 'Why, that's only up north a short ways. Let's go there. I know that things can be quite difficult there, but I Altana has granted unto me the use of sneak and invisible.. We'll be fine.' We eagerly accept the mission and hop on a pair of Chocobos to make the journey.<br><br>As we pass by the knight near La Theine Plateau, he asks us where we might be headed. 'Xarcabard.', we reply. 'We're carrying supplies for the outpost there.' The knight barely restrains an astonished gasp and replies, 'Are ye mad!? You do know that the nether regions are guarded by all manner of demon, dragon, and undead. You'll surely find your death there!' I nod and state 'With Altana watching over us, we'll be protected.' 'That may be, but you'll not be getting there on those beasts. For there is but one way in and one way out of the northern reaches, and the way in is through Ranguemont Pass which is passible only on foot. The pass is guarded night and day and no one that enters may return through that gate, as there are monsters dire and cruel lurking within.' I look over at Annise and chuckle nervously and say 'Oops!' Annise shrugs and turns her Chocobo back to the north. I bid the knight fare well and thank you for the information.<br><br>We eventually reach the pass and the guard is incredulous when we state our intentions. I'm certain I heard him mumble something about 'your funeral' as he allowed us through the gate. As the gate thundered shut we could hear the stirring of those 'dire and cruel' creatures and I quickly called upon Altana to mask our passage. Within short order our protective cloak began to fade and I called it up anew. As we made our way along the pass, Annise and I became separated. I thought she was close behind, but I heard her from afar telling me that her invisibility was fading. Seeing ahead of me an area free from danger, I told her to hurry up and that we would be safe. Unfortunately, as she was passing some goblins her invisibilty failed and she was quickly cut down. It was a terrible, terrible sight to see. I comforted her and called upon Blessed Altana to restore her back to life. After resting for a short while, continued upon our journey.<br><br>Not too long after we started again, I found myself fleeing for my life from several bats. No normal bats were these.. They were of immense size, and once they heard my footsteps, as my sneak had failed, were extremely aggresive. They quickly dispersed my invisiblity and I could do nothing to save myself. I told Annise to quickly run up the pass while she was still cloaked and undetected. I soon found myself restored to health back in San D'Oria. I quickly ran back out to the pass again (and got the 'I told you so' look from the guard at the gate to the pass) and found Annise waiting for me at the exit onto Beaucedine Glacier.<br><br>Having found difficulty and death already, any sane person would have said, 'Wow, this sucks. Let's give up.', but NO! Not us! The clerics had always told me that my obstinance would be the death of me. We were doubly determined to see our mission through, though. We only had heard rumors of the glacier and had at best a vague idea of how to get to Xarcabard from the pass. It was told that great sabertoothed cats and giants called it home. Still, I was confident in my ability to cloak our passage. -How mistaken I was. We had barely entered the glacier when a cat came upon us while I was hastily reapply our invisble and sneak abilities. It moved with terrible speed and cunning and caught me in the act of hiding myself. Annise, safely cloaked, ran for safety while I was yet again reduced to nothing. How could Altana leave me so!? Why would she let her protection lapse in such terrible environs?<br><br>Waking again in San D'Oria I knew I could not leave Annise to fend for herself and quickly run back to the pass. The guard looked at me with surprise and laughed out loud at my misfortune. I inwardly vowed to not let him see that I had failed again. Altana's blessings saw me through to where Annise had somehow managed to stay hidden upon the glacier. Cloaking ourselves again, we started off, only to find that my invisibility was fading almost immediately! Annise took the initiative to make as much progress as she could while I stopped to reapply my invisibilty. -Yet again, I was caught by one of those terrible cats. My body was only but a ragdoll compared to it's powerful claws.<br><br>It was at this time, remembering my vow and contemplating failure, that another party happened upon my lifeless body. Another priestess of Altana was with them and took the time to return me to life. I would like to mention that being dead is an amazing sensation.. It is as if I am hovering outside my body. I can see myself laying there, but cannot feel a thing. It is quite disorienting! After thanking my rescuers, who quickly continued upon their way, I reapplied my sneak and invisible and did my best to catch Annise, who had, miraculously made it to the pass into Xarcabard.<br><br>We found a guard for Bastok standing watch at the pass to Xarcabard and found ourselves faced with a decision of quite some consequence. For a small fee, he would allow us to bind ourselves to that point so that, should we die, we could return there, instead of San D'Oria. This, however, meant that, should we find our quest impossible, that we would be stranded upon the glacier. Regardless of what dangers lurked in Xarcabard, there was no question, we would fullfill our mission. We had the guard bind us at that point and ran off to Xarcabard.<br><br>Xarcabard.. What a terrible place! Nothing can prepare you for the sights there. -Where undead walk night and day. Dragons lurk within the cliffs and demons appear upon ritualistic altars. Soon after entering my cloak fell once again and found myself considering my lifeless body upon the hard cold ground. How could Altana be so cruel!?<br><br>I soon found myself back at the guard who only scoffed at me as I awoke next to him. I quickly hurried back to Xarcabard, as Annise was left, once again, to fend for herself. It took many hours to find her again, and when I did, she was completely unprotected, yet somehow had managed to avoid any encounters. Before we even found the outpost, I came across a teleport point. Realizing that at some point in the future I might wish to return here, I pulled a sliver of crstal off for myself and Annise. Soon after, while we scrambled for a safe place to reapply invisibile and sneak, Annise was assaulted by a demon! A terrible creature, straight out of nightmares it was. With much relief, we eventually found the outpost and and delivered the supplies. Turning to the merchant there to have him teleport us back to the safety of home, we were startled to find that he, unlike all the others, did not have the ability. Annise and I simply stood there silent. Annise's face was devoid of emotion. After all we had been through to find this place there was nothing left to express our utter despair.<br><br>Having managed to cross Xarcabard without incident we returned to Beaucedine Glacier. The Bastokan guard instructed us that there were only two ways off the glacier.. One, the way in which we had come, yet could not return, and the other a pass far to the south that would take us through the mountains and lead us Battalia Downs outside of the great city of Jeuno. We set out to descend the glacier.. The journey was no less perilous, but at least we had had some experience in the area and knew what to expect. We had made our way past many sabretoothed cats, goblins, giants, and even stone golems when we again had difficulty with our protection. Altana forgive me, but after I was yet again killed, this time by a wandering Goblin and it's pet sabretooth cat, I found myself questioning her gifts to me. How could she allow her invisibility to fail us when so endangered. I now know, in retrospect, that is was simply her guiding us. -That we should never have been there and it was fitting punishment for my obstinance.<br><br>Annise again managed to escape harm and hid while I made the trek, once again, down the glacier. Hours later, we met near the bottom and saw that the exit was not far off. I cloaked her and instructed her to make a run for it while the protection lasted. I followed soon after and emerging from the pass found the relatively familiar environs of the downs. Here, at least, I knew we would have a good chance of making the journy to Jeuno. We struggled at times to remain invisible and silent, but eventually made it to Jeuno. -Hardly home, but at least safe. I then swore an oath to never go out so woefully unprepared and ill-equipped. Annise, she quietly collapsed where she stood from exhaustion.<br><br><i><span class=sm>Edited, Wed Jun 16 15:11:07 2004 by wickedtribe</span class=sm></i></p>&nbsp;<br><a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?12670 target=akztarg><u><b>Anuule</b></u></a> - Elvaan - Child of Altana - <a href=HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/journal.html?user=330593 target=akztarg><u>The Misadventures of Anuule</u></a><br>Rank 5, 41 BRD, 40 WHM, 25 THF 22 RDM, 20 BLM, 12 NIN, 11 PLD, 10 WAR, 10 RNG, 8 BST<br>AF1 (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - Mary's Horn (<span style='color: green;'><b>X</b></span style='color: green;'>) - BCNM 40 (<span style='color: orange;'><b>0:0</b></span style='color: orange;'>)</td></tr>
