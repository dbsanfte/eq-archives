<p>Some things to note when searching and viewing the quests:
<ul>
<li>
Information added through the comments will not always make it into the
main quest description. Please continue to e-mail anything substantive
that you believe should be added, as well as information on any new quests
you discover.</li>

<li>
Quests are faction dependant. Every class can do every quest, as long as
they have good enough faction with the quest giver. The suggested "Best
Class" is based upon who can use the ultimate reward for the quest, and
does not mean that only those classes can do the quest.&nbsp; In fact,
many classes may want to do those quests to get the faction and experience
bonuses associated with them.</li>

<li>
The minimum level listed for the quest assumes that you will be doing the
quest solo, or in a small group. Obviously, grouping with a full group,
or with people a significantly higher level than yourself, will allow you
to finish a quest at a lower level than suggested.</li>

<li>
The time to complete is an estimate, and can vary quite a bit depending
upon how lucky you are in catching a spawn and getting the right drop and
whether or not the Mobs you need are already camped.</li>

<li>
The rewards listed are the ones usually given. Some quests need to be done
multiple times in order to get the listed reward.</li>

<li>
This information comes from the players, and is not provided by Verant
or any other official source.&nbsp; While every effort is made to ensure
that the information is accurate and up to date, we cannot guarantee that
there are no errors or mistakes.</li>
