	   <tr><td colspan=2>Since we had been living at the farm for a long period of time we knew the area that we were in fairly well.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we knew that it was called Eastern Karana.  Another thing we found out about was that it was near a place that might need our services rendered to them too.  it was called High Pass Hold, and they said that there was a spot near the kithicor forest that was swarmed by orcs daily.  Now i thought to myself what would our little group have more fun doing than killing orcs.  And i couldn't think of anything.  So I told our little ragtag group of my idea, and it appealed to all of them.  So we decided to go have at it.  We started off in the morning but did not arrive there until it was almost time to camp.  So Radok decided to give his brother a call, because he said he was a few minutes away from where we were.  I said, but Radok you don't have a brother.  And he said yes i do, Mom just never spoke of him before because she thinks he is a disgrace to the family, what with being a rogue and all.  And i then proceeded to gasp.  I thought to myself oh no, a rogue, what shoulfd i say, you never know when a rogue will turn on you and be a backstabber.  But before i could so much as sqeak, radok was gone.  Only about a half hour later He arrived with a dwarf named Konrad.  I said, well he is not a rogue, he is a miner.  And konrad laughed.  He told me that that is what the dwarfs called themselves, but that out here in the &quot;real world&quot; they were called rogues.  I was ashamed at all the rogues i had known that had never told me the truth.  But Konrad said, anyway, enough about introductions, how about I go scout out your camp, and then join your little party?  We all agreed with great enthusiam since this was Radok's brother, and figured that if he could kill the orcs quicker unseen then we would be a better group.<br>&nbsp;<br>when the going gets tough, the cleric starts screaming OOM, OOM!!!!<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654</a></td></tr>

Come to find out she could teleport people to a place she had been before at a &quot;druid ring&quot; I didn't know what the crap she was talking about, but decided that we would give it a shot, because she said that there were wolves at this place that she wanted to send us , that were great to hunt at out season of age.  She teleported us to a place that she called East karana, and brought us to a little farm and told us that this family would greatly appreciate us killing the wolves that strayed by.  Sure enough we went and talked to the family and they said that they would feed, and shelter us if we would just kill anything that came by each and every day.  So we agreed and spent a year or so there, so as to help them, but when there was barely an animal a week that strayed into our territory, we bid the family ado.<br>&nbsp;<br>when the going gets tough, the cleric starts screaming OOM, OOM!!!!<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>the next day I woke with a start, gonnin was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought to myself now where did that little rascal get off to?  and then decided that he had just gone for some water.  Well, once i had gotten fully awake, lo and behold, he had not, i stepped outside of the door to see him dead, and 5 goblins were wating for us to come out too.  I think right then i screamed so loud that everyone in the village heard me.  Anyway, i grabbed my keg popper, and started bashing the hell out of them, trying to avenge my friend.  when Radok stepped into the fray to join me.  but by the time he had come i had defeated all but one of the gobbies.  He healed me then slashed the last goblin to pieces.  then i did what i have been trained to do.  I sat down, memorized a spell, then stood up and reanimated my friend.  He was a little better for the wear and tear than i thought he should be, but that was probably a good thing.  We set up to leave, and I decided right then and there, i didn't want my friends to ever have to experience death ever again.<br>&nbsp;<br>when the going gets tough, the cleric starts screaming OOM, OOM!!!!<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I woke up the next morning to Gonnin screaming and yelling my name.&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen fire beetles were attacking him, and the first thing i thought was &quot;why does he look so bad.&quot;  Then i jumped into action and started healing him, which worked rather effectively, except for the fact that he was without a good armor spell on him, so i put my two best armor spells on him, then healed him again and ran up to help.  Not but thirty seconds later Radok cam out of the tent, awakened by our yelling and screaming, and healed me and Gonnin, then wadded into the mix of dead fire beetles, live fire beetles,and me and gonnin.  In a few minutes we were surrounded by fire beetle corpses.  I was amazed, we counted the dead bodies,there were 17 of them.  That was the most things we had ever killed.  I sat down to meditate, so that i may gain back some of my mana, then realized that i had more than half of my mana.  I was getting stronger, as the days went on.  This was good to learn my limits in a crises situation, but i wasn't happy to do it in this way.  Suddenly i jumped up and cried out to Gonnin, what caused this.  To be honest i had figured that he got a little too carried away about his ability to fight everything.  But he pointed to a mere child, a hobbit named sammigaul, as i later found out.  He was dead, but i used my reanimate spell to find out a little about him.  He was of the 11th season, and was much like me in that he was orphaned at a very young age.  He had been trying to fight the fire beetles by himself.  But even though i was so mad at him, that i could throttle him, I couldn't help but ask him if he would join our group of friends.  Come to find out, this little fella was a druid, just like the other hobbit that i had come across.  I took an immediate liking to him, and took him under my wing.  That little hobbit was one of the best friends i could ever have asked for.  Me, gonnin, and Radok gave him some better armor that we had found in previous adventures, and made him grow, and get stronger faster than he ever would have if he had not met us three friends.  Soon he was able to help us travel faster than before, because he came across a spell that gave you the spirit, and speed of a wolf. after a few weeks of fighting in Unrest, we decided that we needed to go to another part of this intricate and wonderful world, so we went back to my house in Kaladim, and packed everything wewe needed to survive until we would return again. Then we fell asleep, dreaming of the heroic things and feats we would accomplish in the next journey.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri May 10 14:55:54 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>when the going gets tough, the cleric starts screaming OOM, OOM!!!!<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Today was a rather interesting day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened to stumble across my long time friend,Radok.  He knew that i was in the place that i have been to know as unrest, because his mom told him, so he b rought a friend, whos name was gonnin and i found him to be a funny little man.  He was a gnome.  And to top that off, he claimed himself a warrior!  Imagine, a gnomen warrior.  i chuckled aloud when this little friend of Radok told me that he was to help us fight tonight.  I was bigger than him, and probably more suited to deal with the rigorous battle that was to be launched on the undead.  But i figured, why not, I will let this poor gnome warrior (smirk) have his way with the zombies.  But alas, once I had given him a few spells that i had learned 4 seasons ago, he was at the front and center battling like the brothers that i had met the night before last.  If not better!  He was getting hit much less than the brothers had been.  Which meant that I could use my time helping finish the zombies off, instead of doing all that silly meditating, and healing, then inse and repeat.  But with this little fella, i could afford to take a whack at some of those awful undead creatures!  Oh what a glorious day it was indeed.  Not only had i found a friend who was as suprising in heritage as me, but I was able to do one of my most favorite things.  Clean this world of Evil!, and by my own hand, at that!  Oh I could tell this was a fantastic friendship that was being started as I sat there that night.  Needless to say, I had the most fun that i had had in many a full moon.  Once we had killed undead until we felt our insatiable urge to bring peace into this world, we went to the entrance of this foul place and set up our tent, where we would wait until the next morning to return to our cleansing routine.<br>&nbsp;<br>when the going gets tough, the cleric starts screaming OOM, OOM!!!!<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Today i found a very nice group of people. It was a rather diverse and interesting experience. Mostly in my travels all i have dealt with are my dwarven friends, who all are either warriors, miners, or paladins. But today i met a little hobbit who called himself a druid. He had the most interesting of abilities, he could make me go faster. I was amazed at first but then realized that he was overzealous, and was making the greater skeletons and zombies mad at him in a nice little section of the world that has been known to me as &quot;unrest.&quot; But now i am getting off of the subject. While in unrest i made the &quot;druid&quot; friend and met someone who called herself a necroman. I was amazed at first because i thought, but she is a woman, then she came to realize my missunderstanding, and told me she was a necromancer. I had fun hunting with her, because we were extremely good together at vanquashing undead, although she had an undead friend at first that i tried to kill, until she explained to me that that was her pet, and that she had complete control over him. Two of the other people in my new little group of friends were two barbarian brothers who had chosen the path of the warrior. They were 16th and 17th seasoned fighters, so they had a little trouble with moving away from me when i was meditating, and i didn't realize it until i looked up from my spell book and saw them killing a zombie out of my range. I was too far away to tell them that, and if i had shouted to them , i am sure more undead would have joined in the brawl than would have been good, or neccesary. Unfortunatly for me though a werebat joinmed in our little camp later in the night, and all but two of my new found friends, and me died, but lickily I got to talking to the little hobbit, and he said his brother was a cleric like me and was around my season, and that he had found a spell called reanimate, that would bring back people to life. I was amazed to find that there was such a spell for such an enexperienced player, but i ran back to my guild master as soon as i found out, and begged him to sell me the spell that i requested, which he did after much haggling, then as fast as my little feet could carry me, i ran back to my friends and reanimated them. I ran around, so overjoyed that i had gotten this beutiful spell that i reanimated one of my brothers guild members, and asked him to put in a good word for me in the guild, for when i become of the 20th season, so that i may join the guild. All in all it was a great night with new friends, new experiences, and a great deal of learning.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu May&nbsp;&nbsp;9 21:02:32 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>when the going gets tough, the cleric starts screaming OOM, OOM!!!!<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>even though I know all that i need to know about myself, my parents told me that when i found my journal, I might would want to explore a little into my past, and pretend that i am telling someone that doesn't know all that i do about myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they sad i might even want to pass it onto a little brother or sister if i find  one.  So here goes.  I am the parents of Dayton and Ginger Healer.  My brother Myar Healer is there legitamite son, whereas i am adopted.  They are all humans.  My father found me when a female dwarf ran by him yelling for help, and following her was a dragon.  He tried to heal her (he being a cleric) but the dragon made the final blow killing her.  My father slayed the dragon, and searched the female dwarf for any sign of life, but alas, he could not find one.  Although she was carrying me, swaddled in a bundle in her backpack.  My father say's that he knew that that was why he was there when she was running by.  To save me from an Evil and horribly disgusting death.  Although i was a dwarf, and made fun of horribly by the youth that i grew up with, i eventually came to be stronger, more wise, and be able to fight and play for much longer than my brother, who was of the 46th season, when i was only of my tenth , then suddenly, once i became of my twelfth season, my parents were killed in a raid that they had gone to with thier friends.  They ad been killed by the mother of the dragon my &quot;father&quot; had slain when he first found me.  I was shocked and would not even attempt to come out of our home for a season.  All i could do was wallow in my own misery.  Then my brother forced me out of my home.  He took me to a place called Kaladim.  I was amazed at all of the dwarves that were their.  I suddenly fit in.  He helped me settle in, and gave me a few items to help me out in my glorious quest to someday become strong enough and defeat the horrid dragon that killed my parents.  I met a few friends, that i later became the closest of friends with.  Some of them, one being a motherly figure to me (Xamba) and her son (Radok), helped me along the way, Radok being of the same season as me, we faught readily together, and it was an awesome experience, because he had been taught in the ways of the paladin, which was a warrior/cleric, as he liked to call himself.  And with my gifts of armor from my brother, my innate ability to heal, his strong ax, and his diehard attitude that he would never run from a fight, we were a tough combination to beat, and as far as i can recall, we were only beat once, and not bad, because i ran to his mother immediatly ( by the way, she had been called to the way of the cleric also) and she immediatly healed me, and ran to her sons body, where she magically reanimated his body.  I was shocked.  I had never known that such a great thing could happen.  I asked her if that was evil magic, and she saw my fear and explained that no, it was beutifull, and that someday the calling of reanimation would be one of my abilities.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu May  9 21:01:38 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>when the going gets tough, the cleric starts screaming OOM, OOM!!!!<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307639</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307654</a></td></tr>
