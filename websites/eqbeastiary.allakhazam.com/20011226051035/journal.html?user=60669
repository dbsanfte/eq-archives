	   <tr><td colspan=2>The troll warrior Braag did not perish that day.  The Frost Giant Elite quickly subdued the defenseless troll and secreted him to Kael Drakkal.  Braag remembered nothing of this journey; one of the giants had pounded his skull with his armored fist.<br><br>He awoke swaying gently back and forth.  The face of a frost giant was floating, upside down, in front of him.  Braag's head pounded and he was unable to hear.  He tried to look at his feet, which were also in great pain, and realized he was looking up.  The giants had hung him in chains attached to his ankles.  Heavy balls of iron were chained to his wrists pulling his arms towards the floor far below.  It was a most peculiar predicament for the troll.  He returned the gaze of the giant before him.<br><br>&quot;Hah!,&quot; the giant's voice bellowed deeply in the massive room,&quot;The troll is awake, and does not like his place!&quot;  The giant poked at Braag, sending him swinging wildly about the room.  The iron balls chained to his wrists began to tangle and spin.  Braag could feel his arms on the verge of ripping from his body.  With a massive effort, he stopped the entanglement of chains and tried to steady his swinging.  <br><br>The giant laughed again, and Braag heard the voices of three others from behind him join in.  Although the situation seemed hopeless, Braag was no normal troll, and he did not panic.  He looked again at his feet.  A simple pin binded the shackles on his feet.  Braag breathed in deeply and closed his eyes.  Keeping them closed and exerting tremendous force, he began to bend at the waist and raise his arms up.  He moved slowly and deliberately, lifting the cumbersome iron balls chained to his wrists.  Soon, he had his fingers around the pins holding the shackles and he gave them a quick push.  The shackles fell free, and with dexterity more than normal for a troll, Braag grabbed on to the loose shackles before he fell to the floor, even with the weight of the iron chained to his hand slowing him down.<br><br>Now he hung by his hands staring at three richly adorned frost giants standing in front of a great iron door.  Braag grinned at the look of shock on their faces.   The giant who had taunted Braag growled, pulled out a sword and began to advance on the troll.  Braag, hearing his approach, began to kick his legs, trying to gyrate around.  <br><br>&quot;Stop!&quot;  One of the other three commanded the advancing troll.  &quot;He is strong.  We will test him.&quot;  The giant advanced, grabbed Braag and lowered him to the floor below.<br><br>&quot;Troll!  You show power.  If you wish to live, you must prove yourself a warrior.  Rallos Zek commands it.  Glory is achieved only through battle.  Today you will not die without honor.  You have shown courage.  Now fight!&quot;  The giant motioned at Braag to face his tormentor.  The giant raised his great sword and grinned.<br><br>Braag had no weapon; his hands were chained to two heavy iron balls.  The giant brought his sword high and took a massive, crushing swing directly at the troll.  Braag dove nimbly to the side, at the same time pulling the ball and chain on his left arm with all his strength.  The force swung the ball in a great arc about five feet off of the ground.  The chain struck the giant behind his right leg, hurling the iron ball in an ever tightening circle around his leg.  It smashed into his ankle, obliterating flesh and sending chunks of bone flying about the room.  The giant screamed in pain and Braag gave the chain heavy tug.   The giant, already beginning to topple, fell quickly onto his back, smashing tables and sending a rack of weapons flying about the room.<br><br>The giant, unwisely, ignored the troll and reached for his mangled leg.  Braag swung the ball and chain on his right arm around behind him, measured the distance to the giant, and snapped the chain forward as hard as he could.  The powerful heave arced the iron ball through the air.  It whiplashed and plowed directly into the giant's skull.  His head did not explode, the iron ball simply dissapeared into it behind the giant's eye.  The giant fell back with a thunderous crash; blood poured from the wound in his head.  He was quite dead.<br><br>Braag turned to the three remaining giants.  They stood completely still, their faces set in stern judgement.  Braag gave them the biggest, toothy troll smile he could. <br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The elf awoke and tried to push himself up out of the snow.  Everything was a blur.  He was confused.  How had he not died?  What was this?  Warm furs and pelts covered his body.  He wasn't frozen on the river in Everfrost; he was in a very warm and comfortable bed.  His vision began to clear.<br><br>Judd stirred and looked to the crackling of a fire.  It glowed warmly.  Seated next to the hearth was the most welcome sight Judd had seen in many weeks.  The beautiful Lashara gazed intently at him.  He tried to push himself into a seated posistion, but fell back to the bed.  His strength had not returned.<br><br>&quot;You must rest a little more, Jaggedoak.  It is good to see you well.&quot;  Lashara stood up and sat on the bed next to Judd.  She held a small pot of broth.  Setting the broth aside, she lifted Judd's head and propped him up with some furs.  Her touch flowed through the ranger, giving him new energy.  She began to feed him slowly.<br><br>&quot;I found you on the ice.  You were nearly dead.  The shamans in Halas put us up in this room.  You must tell me what happened.&quot;  Lashara reached to feed him again.  Judd took her hand and placed the spoon back in the pot.  He placed her hand, in his, on his chest.  His heart beat fiercely.<br><br>&quot;I owe my life to you yet again.  I have longed to see you these past months.  How did you find me in such a storm?  Tunare has truly blessed you.&quot;  Judd smiled and did not continue.  A rosy blush filled Lashara's face.<br><br>Lashara averted her eyes and stood up.  She took a letter from the mantle,&quot;This was sent by Icewind.  He has an important message for you.  He will be in Highkeep in 5 days to hold a council.  Lunarsa will be there.  He requests your presence.  But, you can not travel, yet.  We will stay here another day and leave tomoroow evening.  For now, you must rest and recuperate.  Now tell me, what happened?&quot;<br><br>Lashara sat on the bed again and took Judd's hands in her own.  Her smile befuddled the ranger.  It was his turn to blush.<br><br>&quot;I th, th, think an assasin was sent by Pusbag to destroy me.  You may be in danger also.

There is a veritable army of barbarians downstairs...anyone of questionable purpose would not live past opening the door, if they made it into Halas at all. With all the goblin activity, they've doubled the watch on the only enterance to the city. Furthermore, unless someone saw me running from where I found you on the ice back to Halas, no one knows I am here, of that I have made sure.&quot;<br><br>Judd was starting to realize that he was no longer in his own clothes. She must have.....He blushed, but was secretly glad the woman had left his gloves on. Had she seen his deformed hand? Judd could only wonder. Lashara did not let on if she had. <br><br>&quot;Before you continue in your story,&quot; Lashara added. &quot;Does the wound beneath your arm need attention? I checked it over recently and it seemed that the salt water and the cold of the river had sealed it up better than any healing efforts I could make. You must let me know if that changes. I didn't carry you all the way back to Halas to have you bleed to death before my eyes.&quot; She smiled lightly at the man, assuring him that she would let no such thing occur.<br><br>Then the woman placed her hands in her lap and smiled softly him, and with a nod of her head. &quot;Sorry for interrupting you, Lord Jaggedoak.

Since then, I went to a total of 6 ranger pages and rated all your posts excellent (okay, so I suck, since I didn't go through and start rating everyone high marks ~ I tried to stick with just the posts I actually read).  Anyway, after 6 pages, and 2 hours (sorry still like to read the posts), you are still sage.  Well, from now on, whenever I see you or the other posters, I'm going to start rating the posts excellent.  It's rather sad that I feel obliged to do this, but it seems that posters such as yourself and  Pusbag are getting buried for no good reason, so I finally have to join the others and begin mass ratings.<br>/sigh<br>&nbsp;<br>Icewind Novastorm<br>Koada Dal Cleric of Tunare<br>&lt;&lt;Mith Marr&gt;&gt;</td></tr>

Many of those posts involve some type of dark humor that doesn't go over too well.  So, I get rated down.  But, the next day when I post again, all the excellent ratings take effect, and I am returned to my highest current rating.  I think that because of the number of posts I put up, I take some hits and my rating comes down reflecting that.  Soon as I post again my rating returns to it's average.  By now, it would be very difficult for anyone to permanently reduce me to &quot;Sage&quot;.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Judd Jaggedoak ended his long run in the Everfrost.  The rugged, frozen wilderness would afford him an excellent opportunity to back track whomever it was that was following him.  Judd had run from Freeport all the way to the realm of the barbarians without stopping to rest.  He knew that his pursuer would be far behind him by now.  But, the ranger also realized he was faced with a cunning foe who was sure to track him down all the way to the Everfrost.  It had to be the work of Pusbag.  He sincerely hoped Lashara was safe.  For that matter he hoped Icewind and all his other friends were safe also.  Because of his banishment, he might not see any of them for many years.<br><br>Once again in Everfrost, mammoths had overpopulated the tundra and the herd required culling.  Judd hired out of Halas to kill mammoths and return their tusks as proof.  On his fifth day on the icy plains, Judd sensed the presence of the &quot;other&quot; once again.  He prepared his morning as usual, hiding his camp beneath some snow and burying what tusks he had culled underneath a pine tree.  He carefully checked his provisions and filled his quiver with arrows.  Weapons ready, he set out onto the icy tundra and began to track mammoths.<br><br>But, he really wasn't tracking them at all.  This time he paid much closer attention to the other that was following him.  From his camp near the mountains Judd headed deep out into a white out snowstorm.  At dusk, he found himself at a great icy river that ran north to south all the way through the Everfrost.  The ice was hardened and slick, but, the nimble elf negotiated it with speed.  <br><br>Well into the night he came upon a hole in the ice.  It was still snowing incredibly hard.  Even with the trained vision of a wood elf ranger, Judd was having trouble seeing anything at all.  He cast an enduring breath on himself and jumped into the water. The cold was numbing, but he always cast magics protecting against frigid temperatures when he traveled in the north.  He swam to the far side of the hole and turned to watch the river.<br><br>After about an hour Judd began to wonder if the &quot;other&quot; had become lost.  His trap would not work.  He would have to come up with something else.  As he began to crawl out of the river, a dark lithe form sprang up in front of him.  Raised over it's head was a chunk of ice.  In it's other hand was a dagger dripping deadly poisons.  A Tier'Dal assasin!<br><br>Judd's first instinct was to fall back into the water.  The dark elf brought the chunk of ice down hard, but, it glanced off of Judd's banded head armor, mildly stunning him.  He began to sink.  The assasin leapt into the icy river after him.  Submerged in the murky cold, Judd recovered and began to grapple with the Tier'Dal.  They both began to sink further into the depths.  The dark elf pinned Judd's right arm and he was unable to draw his blade.  Instead, he reached forward and gripped the Tier'Dal's throat.  The dark elf, in turn, began to stab with her dagger into Judd's armor.  One strike got through and plunged deep into the flesh under Judd's arm.  <br><br>Judd grimaced in pain as the poison began to seep through his body.  The dark elf tried to break free.  She could not breathe under water as the ranger could.  Judd tightened his grip as they settled into the mud at the bottom.  The Tier'Dal struggled fiercely, gasped for air, and bubbles cascaded out of her mouth.  Judd could hear her scream as he broke for the surface.  He looked back and watched her dead form fade at the bottom.<br><br>Some of the poison had washed off in the water, but enough was in Judd's blood to weaken him.  Barely able to pull himself onto the ice, he collapsed in the deepening snow.  Time passed and the cold and weakened state left him immobilized.  The only warmth he felt was the snow that began to cover his body.  With one last effort he cried out for Tunare.  It seemed he would die here.<br><br>Lashara.  He remembered her smile in the torture chamber of Grobb.  Her confidence in the face of death.  He needed her now.  What a fool he had been, never taking a moment to talk to her.  Lahsara.  Judd Jaggedoak's thoughts began to fade..........        <br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Suddenly, there was a swirl of blue light before Judd's eyes. He though he saw another monster bearing down upon him to finish him off. It's bright green eyes were his last image as the world went dark. So familiar... The ranger passed out.<br><br>-- <br><br>Lashara, wrapped up tightly in her polar bear furs, peered down at her friend, and sent a silent thank you across the world to Encina. The druidess had taught her to cure poison very early on, and while the rangeress had not a clue how to cure a disease, she was happy she'd chosen to learn to cure poison instead.<br><br>She'd come to Everfrost a week ago, having had the druid teleport her to Surefall Glades, and then running the days trip to Halas. She too had be out here hunting mammoths on the ice covered river. Having heard a commotion nearby, she'd venture forth in hopes of finding one of those kamkazie goblins that had been stalking her for days. Instead, she was much suprised to see Jaggedoak pull himself out of the water and sprawl on the ice. With her keen senses, she'd instantly picked up on the scent of poison, and sat down to memorize the spell. When she stood back up, she cast quickly, afraid he was already dead. But closer inspection proved he wasn't - yet. Bending over her fallen comrade, she slipped off the fur and wrapped him in it. His soaking garments were already starting to freeze against his skin. With a quick cast of Spirit of Wolf, the woman leaned over and almost shyly scooped the man up in her arms. It felt a little strange, but she didn't have time for being prim and proper just yet. She turned and ran full speed towards Halas.<br><br>The barbarians were all to eager to help her drag an extra bed up to the room she had rented so she could keep close watch on her friend - in exchange for a few of the mammoth tusks she had collected. Respectfully keeping her eyes averted, Lashara stripped the unconscious ranger of his frozen garments and into a large cloth pair of pants a tunic she borrowed from the owner of the inn. Making sure her friend was comfortable in the bed, she started a small fire for extra heat in the tiny room, and sat down on the edge of his bed to watch, and to wait.<br><br>She was confident he would come around shortly....<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Hand maiden of Tunare<br>Ranger of the 30th sun<br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

I can go back and clean things up some and people won't think I wrote anything stupid the first time, huh?  I've been reading your journal because I saw your name in the ranger stuff too.  You are all doing gread stuff here all of you who post here are.  I noticed that your rating dropped since I was reading your journal before I went to the ranger stuff and I think that's terrible.  With the stuff you guys write you're all &quot;Gurus&quot; in my book.  Maybe you've got some enemies like RangaFlama who are making your ratings lower.  That's pretty sad, if you ask me.  I think people shouldn't be allowed to rate anyone else's posts below a certain rating unless they post a reason for rating them down first.  But I haven't been around for that long so I don't know how things really work around here.

Please be patient while I try to figure out why Outlook will not communicate with my current email services.  To Lashara, you have either recieved 10 copies of the same email from me  or none at all.  Soon we will be able to coordinate some type of storyline.  I did get your email from an internet email service.<br><br>As for me, I finally got my computer back.  It is ungodly fast.  I reinstalled all of Everquest and Luclin in about 20 minutes.  All the patches took about 8 or 9 minutes total.  That includes all the optional patches.  Wow! Needless to say I am happy.  Even with 16 new character models activated and updated zones, I zone in about 10 seconds.  So much for the myth that zoning time would be the same for everybody regardless of their computer speed.  Just my stupid email doesn't work.  Windows XP has made setting up email very difficult.<br><br>I made a Barbarian Beastlord on the FV server.  I couldn't get the name Mugali so I selected Subutai.  If anyone is cuious those are Mongol names of generals that fought for Temujin (Chengiz Khan).  I also made a Vah Shir Warrior on Tallon Zek.  Shar Val is a very interesting city and I am having great fun.  See you in game!  Here is a laugh.

Frelia because I just don't like the name anymore.<br><br>For the Firiona server I'm really strongly leaning towards a High Elf Wizard. Will let you know once I pick out a name, etc, etc. I know this would start me on the other side of the world.

My Christmas bonus had been earmarked for upgrades, as a gift to myself, but my wife's plans for the money really made more sense than mine, so I acquiesced.  Besides, she lets me have my own way far too often for me to be stingy about something like this.<br><br>Anyway, I just had to laugh when I saw your comment about why you do not level so quick.  I have the same problem.  When you look at my profile, you should see the following registered characters:<br><br>On the Saryrn Server --<br>-- Abufazzar, Vah Shir Beastlord<br>-- Damior, Erudite Enchanter<br>-- Djaidn, Half Elf Rogue<br>-- Djimn Rowanwood, Halfling Druid<br>-- Khoush Bloodeyes, Iksar Monk<br>-- Maroc, Dwarven Cleric<br>-- Warric, Barbarian Shaman<br><br>On the Firiona Vie Server --<br>-- Djian, Human Monk<br><br>In my journal, I posed a question about whether or not I should delete Djian, my Human Monk, and recreate Abufazzar there.  And I wanted some input from you, Pusbag, et al.<br><br>In light of the fact that you now have a Barbarian Beastlord there, would there be any advantage (meaning to the roleplaying group) in my leaving Djian there?<br><br>I ask because I am leaning strongly towards the roleplaying possibilities presented by the cat, but do not want to delete Djian if he can be of any help to your new beastlord, Lashara's new character, etc. on the FV server.<br><br>Just wanted some input.  I may bag the whole idea until I can see more of Luclin.  As it is, my system is not handling the expansion as well as I would have liked.  I may just piddle around until such time as I can get it upgraded or replace it altogether.  Then, there will be some serious play time overdue!<br><br>Good luck with the email problems.  Have you been able to get your ISP to give you the POP3 and SMTP server addresses for Outlook to hook into?  Beat them up about it -- that's what Technical Support is for.

Ironhom and his friends were forced to retreat to the elven outpost at Fironia Vie.  Ironhom shrugged off their stategic retreat.  They would be back.  After Queen Usula's minions let their gaurd down a little, of course.<br><br>The transactions for the druid portal complete, the four adventurers gathered near the bank.  Powerful magics crackled and hissed around them as the druid opened up the portal to the Butcherblock Mountains.  Ironhom did not like traveling the seas aboard ships, but, druid portals did not make him comfortable either.<br><br>Once in Butcherbock, the party said their goodbyes to the druid and camped for the evening.  Several other bands of adventurers had also set up camps near the druid portals.  Ales and tall stories were shared well into the night.  Tomorrow, Ironhom, Zanaq and Gnomoh would begin a journey to Mistmoore.  There they would do battle for a time against the various undead and servants of Mayong Mistmoore, who was an enemy to all forms of life on Norrath, be it dragon, human or troll.<br><br>The vampire overlord of Mistmoore even defied the gods themselves.  Ironhom shook his head.  Why must he always pick the most formidable enemies in life?  A barbarian warrior fell into the camp fire in front of him.  The drunken brute simply got up and walked away, smoke rising from his body, and took another ale from a pit full of them.  Ironhom chuckled and got up to join him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Lashara awoke with a start, and looked around the darkness of the room she had rented for the night. Her heart was pounding in her ears, and the tiny hairs on the back of her neck were tingling. She was frightened, she must have had a bad dream. Looking around for her bedclothes she discovered them kicked onto the wooden floorboards. With a tug she pulled the wraps back onto the bed and around herself, and leaning against the headboard of the bed, she closed her eyes and tried to remember.<br><br>Nothing came at first. But then in the silence of her memory a scream rang out. Her own. She remembered the stench of feces in the room where the troll had cleaved her fingers off. nconsciously she cradled them protectively with her other hand. The dream had turned then, to the death of the rogue elf, and his lifeless, headless body collapsing into the muck of the swamp. The ranger shivered at the memory.<br><br>But there was something more, something deeper tugging at the back of her mind. At last the image came,though it did not make sense to her. A black wolf running in terror through a forest, perhaps the Kitchor she noted to herself, pursued closely by a shadow-like figure. She wondered what it meant.<br><br>Unable to fall back to sleep, the woman went to one of her bags and removed the small bundles of silk she had purchased from a vendor nearby. With expert skill she wove them together as she sat cross legged on her bed, silently mulling over the events of the past few days, and wondering who her own pursuer had been.<br><br>Judd would have recieved the news of his banishment by now. She wondered idly where he would go now, and if she would ever see him again. In all her seasons, she had never known of a banishment, although she was sure they must have occured. It was altogether troubling to her. Worse still, if he were greatly distrought by the news, as she would have been, he might do something rash or dangerous and bring about his own demise. Could Judd's banishment have something to do with her dream?<br><br>This thought terrified her. For the rest of the night she stayed awake, casting over and over the only spell she knew to directly invoke the attentions of the All Mother, and asked again and again for his safety. Still, she could not shake the feeling that something bad was about to happen. When dawn broke, she gathered her things, and left for the day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Hand maiden of Tunare<br>Ranger of the 30th sun<br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The shock of being banished had worn off of Judd's psyche.  He stood on the dirt road leading from Freeport in the East Commons.  His face was wind blown from weeks spent outdoors.  The road was busy with human farmers and merchants traveling to and from Freeport.  Nobody took notice of the dusty ranger.<br><br>Judd was being trailed.  Of that he was sure now.  Even here, on this busy road, he could feel he was being watched.  Judd was a bit miffed that he couldn't see his adversary.  He had tried back tracking whomever it was several times to no avail.  His progress had been slowed playing cat and mouse games with this unseen opponent and it was time for a change in tactics.<br><br>Few people outside of Kelethin knew about Judd's legendary feats of endurance when it came to running.  At six years of age he was able to run from Akanon to Kaladim without stopping for rest or water.  He once crossed all of Antonica, stopping only once to sleep for a few hours.  Even though no one would know about it, he decided to set a record which would surely never be broken.  <br><br>Judd smiled, the run would be good to work out his frustrations.  He cast the spirit of wolf on himself.  He wondered how fast his pursuer could run.  At full speed he would reach the Kithicor woods at sundown in two days.  Many travelers would not pass through the haunted forest at night, but Judd had on several occasions.  He knew several paths that the undead Tier'Dal and Fier'Dal skeletons, ghouls, and ghasts did not follow.  Would his pursuer survive the run through Kithicor at night?<br><br>Judd began to run, quickly outpacing the other travelers on the road.  Beyond Kithicor, Judd would not stop.  He knew that once he exited the Karanas, he would continue north, all the way to the Everfrost Peaks and Halas.  He would not stop at all.  Judd felt good and thought that when he reached the entrance to Halas, he might just have to turn around and come all the way back again.  Who knew?  The journey may take several weeks.  His opponent could only conclude that Judd had gone insane.<br><br>So, Judd Jaggedoak raced through the East Commons, at the beginning of his great journey.  As the sun began to set in the west, Judd was filled with power and confidence.  He was surrounded by Tunare's blessings, and never felt more at home.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/roleplay as Ironhom Hammerforge, Dwarven Paladin.<br><br>Ironhom Hammerforge, dwarven paladin, made haste for Kunark after setting his affairs in order at Kaladim.  The news of the banishment of Judd Jaggedoak disturbed him, but, if Judd must regain his honor in Faydark in the wilds of Norrath, then so be it.  Honor was important to the paladin.  He understood that, at times, it required great effort and sacrifice.  He knew Judd would conduct himself well.<br><br>Ironhom teamed up with the gnomish enchanter Gnomoh Gnoles and the gnomish mage Zanaq Zamagnificent.  Also joining their raiding party was the halfling rogue Yuge.  And raid they did.  The Lake of Ill Omen was their first target.  Why not wreak havoc in Queen Usula's backyard?<br><br>They spent the first few days slaying goblins at what was known to locals as the goblin tower.  It stood at the far end of a valley west of the ancient Combine windmill.  Occasionally, they were also able to ambush a skeleton or sarnak recruit that passed by.  But their prime target was Iksar.  Any Iksar, be it shadow knights, necromancers, shaman or warriors.  <br><br>Many fell at the might of the adventuring party.  The only nemesis that caused them to fall into retreat was the Tier'Dal enchantress named Doohickey.  Several times she had used her powerful magics to disperse the adventurers.  She was cunning and evil beyond even the most wicked of Tier'Dal.  The Iksar had a very powerful ally in Doohickey. <br><br>Even with the infrequent setbacks, Ironhom and the others would stay in the Lake of Ill Omen for awhile.  Then perhaps, they would raid the Frontier Mountains and crush any giants that opposed them.  Either way, camping high in the mountains surrounding the lake, the guerilla band would be a thorn in the side of Queen Usula for some time to come.<br><br>/ooc - I took the liberty of infusing several of the people I hunt with on Tallon Zek into this little story.  There really is a dark elf enchantress named Doohickey.  She will attack entire groups of 6 adventurers.  She is fearless and probably the best enchanter I have seen in PVP (no disrespect to Gnomoh, a RL friend of mine).  Doohickey (with the help of only 1 Iksar Shadownknight) killed me 3 times last night in game.  Of course I had very little help, but when I did, we did force her into retreat once.  I can't giver her too much credit (lol).  Perhaps one day I will turn the tables on her.<br><br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Dwarven Paladin<br>Tallon Zek Server<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Regardless of the fact that she was being watched, the elven woman was uneasy. All the world knew she had been brought home to Kelethin, and anyone, good or evil, would know to seek her there. But no amount of speed seemed to allow her to outdistance her supposed follower. She resigned herself to the fact that she had a tag-along.<br><br>Sitting at the base of one of the eastern lifts, the ranger allowed the younger members of her guild to come to her. Upon each she cast the Strength of the Earth, Shield of Thistles and Wolf's Spirit, to help them in their battles. If Pusbag wanted a war, she would help to create the army that would be his demise.<br><br>As she gazed at the pages of the spellbook, a soft male voice asked from her left. &quot;Pardon me, my lady, but could your direct me to the ranger and druid guilds? It has been some time since I was in these parts and my memory is failing me.&quot;<br><br>She looked up to see a young, dark haired Fier'Dal male standing beside her, clad in leathers and carrying some sort of battle hammer. With a smile she acknowledged the druid. &quot;Of course, m'lord.&quot; She replied, and took him up the lift and to each of the guild houses.<br><br>She was suprised then, while ready to take her leave of him, he turned into a wolf, and not a greater wolf, but a Howler, and sat down at her feet. The words spoken softly into her mind were kind. &quot;Many thanks, lady. I have been away from these parts since my 38th summer, and was missing some of my spells. Perhaps, in recompense, I can help you by teleporting you anywhere you need to go? It would be the least I could do.&quot; <br><br>Lashara smiled. At last, a way to escape from her persuers. She kneeled and whispered her chosen destination in the wolf's keen ears. His yellowed eyes gleamed softly.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It was a dark day for the orcs of Crushbone.<br><br>A female woodelf, stood alone on the balcony of the orc throne room, mangled bodies of orc emissaries strewn about her feet. No one dared to come near her, not even the hunting party of Koada'Dal that had entered the place behind her and were now discussing the recent events of the banishment of Judd Jaggedoak. Lashara did not care to hear it.<br><br>Every so often, a stray centurion or leggionaire would pass below the balcony. She wryly estimated that their average life span after such a mistake was about 5 seconds. Fingers were intact, her bow at the ready, and Lashara was angry.<br><br>She would have been at that council meeting when Judd returned, if she had not been asked to leave by Maesyn after her uprising when she heard the judgement of the high council. Perhaps a truce with a vile troll was stupid on his behalf, perhaps some scouts had perished. She was sorry for that, she really was. But who was to say that the incident would not have occured if there had been no truce? If Pushead had simply wanted to spy on Faydwer, he could have abducted her anyways and no one would have been the wiser. And then perhaps she might be the one in pieces on the floor. And some troll in elf's clothing might be prancing about Kelethin right now. <br><br>It was really too bad that Lord Darish, Emperor Crush and D'Vinn had had the oracle evacuate them when she kicked down the place walls. Once in her career already Lashara had had D'vinn at the tip of her sword. It would have been nice again. And the wood elf was not feeling particularily merciful this day.<br><br>Perhaps Lashara's worst quality was her temper. It was a trait in herself she was well aware of, and one reason, among many, why she had chosen to follow Tunare and not the goddess's raging counterpart, Karana. Having this redhaired elf under the guidence of a god of storms would have been asking for trouble.<br><br>Most of her stolen equipment had been replaced by her guild family, the only family she had known for as long as she could remember. The Scouts, the Champions, and the Soldiers of Tunare had been her family all her life. And though none were related to her by blood that she was aware of, all were her Brothers and Sisters.<br><br>A few more twangs of her bow string, followed by the agonized scream of a dying centurion, and the wood elf slung her bow back over her shoulder. She would not stay here a day longer. Encina would be sorry for her sudden departure but would certainly understand. Lashara did not know where Judd had gone to, and she was not about to attempt to follow him. She would make a quick stop at a gnomish outpost and then leave Faydwer for the time being.<br><br>The high elves stepped from her path as she came down from the balcony. No one spoke. And then the wood elf smiled. &quot;Tunare's blessing upon you,&quot; she said quietly, and then began her trek across the Faydark. She had something particular in mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Hand maiden of Tunare<br>Ranger of the 30th sun<br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The sealed note from Queen Usula contained negotiations that Judd felt must be delivered to Kelethin.  He was not the one to decide such treaties.<br><br>When he walked into the guildhall for Faydark's Champions, he was surprised to see a high council of elves assembled.  Even General Jyleel was present from Felwithe to represent the King.  The druid guildmaster was here, along with the leaders of the scouts and warriors.  Judd approached Maesyn Trueshot and bowed.  He handed over the letter from  Queen Usula.  Maesyn gave the letter a brief lookover, sighed, and handed it to General Jyleel.  The general took it without looking at it.<br><br>Maesyn looked sternly at Judd Jaggedoak.<br><br>&quot;Ranger of the Faydark, Judd Jaggedoak, your name is well known in these halls.  Your years of service have not passed without the assembled leaders taking note of your accomplishments.&quot;<br><br>Maesyn raised his voice.<br><br>&quot;On this day, you stand before us to be judged.  All of your recent activities have been noted in the histories of the elves.  For allying with the troll Pusbag Infection, you are to be banished from Faydwer.  Your deeds have lead to the deaths of 3 Tunare Scouts and countless frogloks and lizardmen.  While they may not be allies to this nation, they are to be respected under Tunare's greater plan.  Your careless negotiations have put Faydwer in conflict with Grobb.  One of your guild was maimed in Grobb and it bodes well for you that she was healed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You will not return to your homelands until you have achieved the 50th season, becoming a true wanderer and understanding the duties that befit a Champion of the Faydark.  Never again will you enter into any negotiation without direct orders from your superiors.  You will conduct yourself in your time of wandering as a true Tunare Ranger, protecting all of nature where you see it attacked.  You will live off of the land, and find no sustenance in any city.  You will sleep outside of civilization.  You will send reports back to this guild on all things of consequence that you observe.  We know that your honor will preclude you from violating these dictates.&quot;<br><br>Having finished, Maesyn Trueshot turned his back to Judd Jaggedoak.  The assembled leaders also turned away from the ranger.  Without a word, Judd saluted them and left Kelethin.  He made haste for the docks in the Butcherblock mountains and did not turn back until the boat to Freeport had departed.  He stood silently at the stren of the vessel, and watched Faydwer fade into the mist.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

Try as he might, using every method in his ranger's bag of tricks, he could not lay sight on whoever/whatever was tailing him.  If there was even someone tailing him...<br><br>As he settled down for a long boatride, Judd still felt as if a pair of eyes were fixed on his back, leaving him restless and annoyed.<br><br>Was it a member of the council?  Or was it someone more sinister?  Tunare knows how Evil seemed to dog his every step these days ever since he had anything to do with the Troll Emperor.  That thought made him look down at the  long green fingers on his hand which remained such a vivid reminder of his recent adventures.<br><br>Well, whoever it is was not about to spoil a nice sea cruise if he could help it.  The tranquil slapping of the water against the hull always soothed Judd, and he had discovered long ago it was a wonderful opportunity to catch up on one of his favorite pastimes:  fishing.  Jaggedoak broke out the collapsable fishing pole he won in a game of chance against a gnome years ago, and placed a fishing grub on the hook.<br><br>Ahhhhhhh.  After breaking the seal on a cold bottle of ale Judd settled back for a nice relaxing sail.  Spying ghosts be damned, nothing was going to interfere with his fishing!  So he leaned back against the rail, propped the pole up, and soaked in the sunshine...<br><br>--Pusbag Infection<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ironhom studied Judd Jaggedoak's mangled hand with curiousity.<br><br>&quot;Hrrmm, the trolls seem to have done a good job on it.  But, I don't know about this plan of yours to &quot;grow&quot; your fingers back.  I think you could learn to wield your weapons again with a little training.  But this?  Pusbag had you tortured.  Why would you trust anything he says?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can not sit here in Faydwer training again for years and years.  The trolls will be looking for ways to move againt these lands and I must be out watching for them.  The Butcherblock is the only place a trollen army could land to assault the Faydwer and we must be prepared.  Now give me some more ale.&quot;  Ironhom was glad to give the elf more to drink.  Perhaps he would fall asleep before commiting to his plan.<br><br>Judd drank the ale and slammed the cup onto the table.  Tumpy Irontoe looked on in suspicion from behind the bar.  He was glad that an old customer like Lord Jaggedoak had returned, but he was uneasy at the innebriated state the elf was in.<br><br>&quot;Tumpy, another of your tonics please!  Where is that gnome with the blood?&quot;  Judd fiddled with an unopened bottle of wine in front of him, then stared at some wormwood root that had been pulverized in a dish.  Was he sure he wanted to go through with this?<br><br>The doors to Irontoe's Eats opened and in walked Gnomoh Gnoless, the powerful gnomish enchanter.  He spied his friends and took a seat at the table.<br><br>&quot;Do you have the blood you bald headed bean puller?&quot;  Judd sputtered at Gnomoh.<br><br>&quot;What, no hello, no thanks?  Gnomoh is here and I have your troll blood.  Do not fret.  Give me one of those tonics and then we'll get started.&quot;  Ironhom laughed and ordered another Tumpy's Tonic for Gnomoh.<br><br>After some discussion about what Judd was about to attempt, Gnomoh handed a vial of troll blood to Judd.  Judd tried to remember how Pusbag had described the mixture.  He had said to use three parts of wine to one part of the troll blood, then to mix it with the wormwood root.  Judd began mixing the ingredients, but, adding just a little bit more troll blood than the recipe called for.<br><br>Judd laid his injured hand on the table.  The index finger and middle finger were missing where the Cuddler had torn them off.  Ironhom looked at Judd and he nodded.  Ironhom sighed and pulled out a very sharp dagger.  He held Judd's hand down at the wrist and cut the ends of the two stubs off.  Blood began to pour onto a cloth they had set on the table.  A small crowd of dwarves that had gathered commented on how the elf did not cry out.  Nothing less was to be expected of a hero of Kaladim.<br><br>Judd saw the pool of blood forming on the cloth and drank down the putrid concoction of troll blood, wormwood root and wine.  Instantly he doubled over in pain.  A fire burned in his stomach.  To Judd it felt as if the fire creeped out of his stomach and began to move towards his injured hand.  His body broke out in a sweat.  When the fire reached his injured hand the pain became so great the bar began to spin about him.  If he had not drank all those Tumpy Tonics, surely he would have passed out.<br><br>Judd stared in horror at his hand.  Others gathered around gasped and some backed off.  Ironhom only shook his head; he had a feeling this might happen.  Green gnarly fingers began to grow where Judd's fingers had been cut off.  Almost immediately they grew to full length and the pain in his body subsided.  Judd was speechless.  He had troll fingers!<br><br>Judd flexed his new fingers.  They moved as gracefully as his old fingers had.  He grabbed his Trueshot longbow, which was leaning against the wall.  He drew the strings back with his former expertise.  Everything was back to normal, except for the fact that he now had two troll fingers.  Judd quickly put on a pair of gloves.  What would Lashara think?  What would Maesyn Trueshot say if he saw them?<br><br>&quot;I think I will need several more Tumpy Tonics.&quot;  Judd declared.  Ironhom looked at Gnomoh and they burst out laughing and ordered up another round.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Dec 14 10:03:00 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Judd's turn for the watch had come.  Braag unfurled his skins and promptly fell into a deep sleep.  Judd laughed silently to himself as the Troll began to snore loudly.  He was afraid the sound might thunder across the Eastern Wastes and spur the mating urges of a Frost Giant.  A heavy snow began to fall.<br><br>After about an hour, Judd saw a shape zig zagging through the wall of snow.  It was flying about 5 feet off of the ground.  He knew it to be a Fironia Drixie.  A sense of foreboding filled the Elven ranger.  The drixie would only come this far north if it posessed important news.<br><br>The drixie settled upon his shoulder and put it's small, dragon like head near the ranger's ear.  Few people knew that Judd Jaggedoak studied almost every known language in Norrath.  Dragonspeak was one of the languages he had mastered.<br><br>The little creature spoke quickly and when it's message was delivered, it flew a short distance away and gated out of the snowstorm.  Lord Jaggedoak stood frozen for a moment, then turned and stared at the sleeping form of Braag.  Silently he snuck up to their camp and gathered his belongings.  He faced the troll again and began to cast a spell.  Roots sprang from the earth and completely covered Braag.  Judd cast another spell and snared the Troll also. <br><br>&quot;What? What is this?&quot; Braag was now awake and confused.  Judd picked up Braag's weapons and began to run to the edge of the cliff they had camped near.  He tossed the weapons over the side into the sea.<br><br>&quot;Stop!  Jaggedoak!  Why did you do that?  Call off your vines!  Stop this at once!  You coward!  You ambush me in my sleep.  Pusbag was right when he said not to trust you!&quot;  Braag began to struggle against the vines.  Judd ignited the end of an arrow, notched it, and launched it high into the sky.  He knew a couple of Frost Giant Elite Warriors had passed by not too long ago and would run to this spot to see what the flare portended.  The Frost Giants had grown to hate Judd and Braag the last few weeks.  Already he could feel their footsteps rumbling through the earth.<br><br>Assuming the spirit of the wolf, he began to run for the great span and back to the Gnomish pirate camp.  He knew he could make it in one day if he did not stop to rest.<br><br>______________<br><br><br>As the pirate skiff appraoched the shores of the the Desert of Northern Ro, Judd contemplated the betrayal of Braag and more so the treachery of Pusbag Infection, the Troll Emperor.  The Drixie informed Judd that minions of Pusbag had abducted Lashara.  Although he had not seen her in years, his heart still burned at the news.  He had known nothing but cold fury since the drixie had departed.<br><br>He leapt off of the skiff and immediately started to run towards the south.  At this pace he could make it to the pier in the Oasis of Marr where the Bloated Belly docked from Kunark in less than a day.  The dark races used this vessel to travel to and from Kunark.  His hope was to cut off Lashara and her captors before they reached Grobb.<br><br>After he had cut the arm off the Ogre at the docks and burned his eye out, the brute gave up the information Judd was looking for. He was disheartened to learn that the Troll war party had already passed through a day earlier.  At full speed Judd knew he would reach the Troll city about the same time the war party did.  He fed the still living Ogre to a nearby crocodile and set off for Grobb.<br><br>________________________ <br><br>This story will be continued in Pusbag's journal.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>She was on a ship.<br><br>Wearily, the woman, climbed up the steps to the deck. It had been a long journey, and though she held dear all of nature, the water was perhaps her least favorite component. Swimming, at best, was tiring, and ship travel was far, far worse.<br><br>It was unknown to her the cause of her dramatic recoupery. Perhaps it was all the effort she'd put in, exhausting her knowledge of healing magics by casting as recasting the same spell, which had little, if any effect. Perhaps it was the stamina improving effects of the new spell Shrub has taught to her that enabled her to finally move about freely. Or perhaps it was a hidden blessing of Tunare, invoked by a high priest at the behest of her dear friend's quill - an action of his she still was not aware of. Whatever the cause, she could walk and do some mild physical activity. It was better than lying in bed.<br><br>Several minutes before her arrival on deck, she had heard the shipmaster call out that the shuttles to Faydwer were nearing. The woman closed her eyes and smiled. This meant she would soon be home. She hoped to land at the docks by morning, and walk to Kaladim from there. She knew the dwarves would remember her and welcome her as the ranger who slew hundreds of the goblins that threatened their unusual, but certainly fair, city. She would stay the night there, and, if she was lucky, make it to Felwithe the next day.<br><br>Motion on the water moved her from her thoughts. The shuttles were here. With controlled excitment the ranger made her way down the ramp to the boarding area of the ship, gripping the handrail all the way. The step onto the shuttle, as always, made her uneasy. She hated boats.<br><br>However the moment the shuttle pulled away from the ship, she sensed something was wrong. Though she hated ship travel, she was accustomed to it, and the shuttle was moving far too sluggishly in her mind. Concerned, peered down into the lower constructs of the tiny boat and realized with a scream that the shuttle's hull was filling with water. They were sinking! Too far now from the gangway to get back, Lashara realized she only had one option. As the shuttle passed around the stern of the boat, she jumped clear and landed on the narrow wooden ridge above the mighty ship's rudder.<br><br>She thrust her sword into the side of the ship for balance. Clinging to it, and trying not to notice the water rushing past in great waves so close beneath her fragile perch, she screamed for help from the people still on board of the ship. Her cries were lost to the wind and the rain. No one could hear her.<br><br>As a last resort, the elf reached behind her with her free hand and into her backpack, withdrawing the cords she had been making back in Firiona Vie to tie the bags she tailored. Quickly knotting them together into a rope, she bound the free end to an arrow, the other end to her belt. She prayed this would work.<br><br>With a zing, the arrow flew up over the top of the boat and arced gracefully down. A tug on the rope confirmed that the arrow had embedded itself into something heavy. Whether or not that something was stable was a factor in this equation she had to risk. Pulling her sword free of the boat's hull, she began to climb up.<br><br>Thankfully, the rope held. The woman dragged herself up over the lip of the boat and smiled faintly to see the hooked arrow she had crafted the day before embedded deeply into the floor of the deck. Exhausted and relieved, she sprawled on her back on the ship and looked up at the sky.<br><br>She hated boats.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Hand maiden of Tunare<br>Ranger of the 30th sun<br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Action report delivered to Emperor Pusbag:<br><br>/Shammar slipped over the gunwales of the mighty ship and closed in on her prey.<br><br>&quot;I saw Lashara lying there on deck breathing heavily as if from great exertion, closing her eyes in relief from the near death experience she had just participated in.  She seemed close to exhaustion, perhaps from a combination of seasickness and the task of saving her own skin so far from shore.  The prospect of swimming several leagues back to the mainland was daunting-- even to me, a Troll, who practically grew up in the waters of Da Swamp.  <br><br>I signaled to my accomplices that the switch was about to take place.  With one last examination of her face and body structure I began to recite the incantation that would transform me from the lovely Rubenesque Troll that I am to the horribly disfigured and anemic elf lying before me that would hardly qualify as a midnight snack.<br><br>Lashara was, I suppose, beautiful for an elf, most certainly becoming in the eyes of her fellow domesticated cattle, but her features lacked the salient marks of traditional loveliness:  hairy moles, warts, thick coarse hair, and most importantly, green skin.  Her scrawny build had no meat on her bones to entice members of the opposite sex and the smoothness of her flesh was quite repulsive.<br><br>Oh well.  I had a task to perform and my leige lord, Emperor Pusbag, had placed great confidence in my abilities to complete the mission.  I finished mouthing the words and felt the powerful magics wrap around my body.  My skin moved as if made of water, changing shape, color, and texture.  My body temperature rose a few degrees and the heft of my bulk melted away causing my clothing to slough off my body like a snake's skin.<br><br>I looked around me on deck and saw that the opportunity was perfect for the body-snatching.  There was noone on deck and the sailors were occupied in their work below, leaving me alone with Lashara.  I slipped from behind the crate I had been hiding behind and cast &quot;Stun&quot; on Lashara before she had a chance to react!  I stripped her of her clothing and thumped her on the forehead with my finger to insure she remained incapacitated and heaved her up over my shoulders.  Her lolling head drooped down and her eyes rolled around in their sockets causing me to wonder if I had been too forceful in my abduction.  However, time was slipping away and I might be caught at any moment by a wandering passenger, so I flipped her over the rail to my levitating crew, who speedily gated away back to Grobb with their prize.<br><br>Heheh.  I was no longer Shamaar the Doppleganger, but was for all intents and purposes Lashara the Ranger, consort of Jaddedoak, prisoner of Emperor Pusbag.   Heheh.  Even my laugh had that annoying tinkle of a windchime instead of the hearty guffaw of a Troll.  The magics being used were powerful indeed!<br><br>I quickly dressed and gathered Shamaar-Lashara's weapons and backpacks and prepared for my next move...<br><br>/Shamaar-Lashara casually leaned up against the deckhouse and let the sun soak into her lithe form as she planned her infiltration of Faydark.<br>***********************************************************************<br><br>/Pusbag read the report with greedy interest and roared with delight at the prospect of interogating his new prisoner.<br><br>--Pusbag Infection<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc <br><br>I can not speak for Lashara, but, I am dreaming up a new story for her freedom as we speak.  It actually fits quite nicely since (I am still without my computer) I went to Wizards today and logged Judd on.  I acutally took him away from Velious into Oasis of Marr on my to the Rathe Mountains.  I think Judd might catch wind of what is going on near the dock where the Bloated Belly arrives and departs.  Anyway, by the time we are all done with this stuff we should have a huge interwoven storyline.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>Wood Elf Ranger<br>Master Fletcher<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br><br></td></tr>
