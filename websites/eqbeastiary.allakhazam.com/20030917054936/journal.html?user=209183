As I've written previously, I have been eyeing my epic quest and would love to get this completed.  Unfortunately, the luck I've had with pickup raids has been less than appealing.  I've tried a total of three raids all of which have resulted in various failures.  <br><br>The last raid I attempted was at level 52 and had run to the druid rings after pulling all of my resist gear out of the bank and donning it.  After an interminable time it seemed of waiting for the raid to start, we began to make our way back to the lair of Nagafen.<br><br>We made it to the buff room where we proceeded to buff everyone up and began pulling the fire giant guards and dispatching them.  The monk who was pulling however, decided to pull Nagafen as well and the raid quickly got wiped.  After then waiting on CRs, we were then told to find a tiny coffin for Corpse Summons.  No CRs were going to occur since the giants we had cleared were beginning to reappear and thus made in place rezzes impossible.<br><br>This was the point where I decided to stop doing pickup raids and focus my attention on leveling.  Im now at level 54 and working various areas in PoI and the PoD making decent experience to boot.  Money has been less than spectacular but I have managed to eek together a semi-decent set of equipment with the money I have been able to pull together.  I figure at this point, the only chance I have of pulling off my epic is the lvl 60 dragons of Talendor and Gorenaire with the help of the guild.  This should be a bit easier now that our guild has grown considerably with the addition of the Reavers of Justice, a fine group of people.<br><br>Im figuring at this point I will continue leveling until 60 at which point I will shift a majority of the experience gained to alternate advancement.  <br><br>-Bael</p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

Well this one is anyway.<br><br>I have been keeping my eye on my paladin quest and reading up on things I have to do so that as events arise, I can join or participate as necessary.  My next epic item requires me to put the Book of Scale together from the Books of Frost and Fire dropped by Vox and Nagafen.  Sure these books are dropped by other named dragons but these dragons are a bit over my raid participation capabilities for the moment.  Vog and Naggy, however, are right up my alley and at 48, Im well within the expected level ranges for raids of this type.<br><br>In preparation for these raids, I spent about 1600PP a few nights ago buying various resist enhancing items to help me in these upcoming raids.  I was eagerly awaiting the chance to don these new items in my quest for the Fiery Defender.  <br><br>Arriving in PoK yesterday afternoon, I asked if anyone knew anything about any upcoming raids on Naggy or Vox.  I was then told to listen in to the private Vox and Naggy channels set up to coordinate the efforts of adventurers wishing to fell these mobs.  I logged into these channels and was a tad disappointed that a Naggy raid was already underway.  If I had been able to get on a bit earlier, I could have been a part of that.<br><br>Seeing Kalyaris online, I asked if we were still planning on going to Permafrost to kill the Elite Guards so that she could get her Icy Greaves for her lambent replacement.  She was game as was Brogain so we headed off to Permafrost to see what trouble we could stir up.<br><br>We arrived in Permafrost, a zone I had spent quite a bit of time in as previously, and we headed straight for the Kings room.  It was quite refreshing to head past all those Ice Goblins who normally would have agro'd a younger adventurer.  <br><br>Arriving in the Kings room, we began massacering the hapless goblins in the room.  What normally would have caused quite a problem for me earlier in the career was quickly taken care of with the strong bunch of adventurers who now stood before them.  After a few round of this, we finally found the Icy Greaves that Kaly wanted.<br><br>During our time down here, we also downed the High  Priest Zaharn and got his Coronet for Brogain and killed a couple of Ice Giant Diplomats for good measure.  We even took care of the Ice Giant Magus who was yellow to both Kaly and myself and black to Brogain indicating that he was a 51 level mob.  This guy was guite a load to handle and had a ton of hitpoint to back him up.  With the capable heals of Brog and myself, we finally brought him down without any trouble.<br><br>When we had zoned in, I asked Kaly if she had Vox on track.  I was pleasantly surprised when Kaly said she was and informed the Naggy raid leader who had killed him that Vox was up and that if they wanted some additional help on a Vox raid, the three of us would be interested.  After what seemed like an eternity, the only reply I got was &quot;OK&quot;.  Thus begins the start of the unorganized raid from hell.<br><br>Over the course of the next hour and a half, this individual attempts to rally support for a Vox raid over the Vox private channel and asks people to send him a tell with class and level.  We do so and await at least a confirmation reply or status of the raid.  Was it going to happen?  Was it not going to happen?  Where were we meeting?  Who was involved?  No one seemed to know so we figured they would have to pass us in the Kings room and we went back to our camp of the room just to pass the time.<br><br>In the meanwhile, Brog went back for KEI and I ran back to the Halas bank to pick up my resist gear in preparation for the raid and came back to meet everyone in the Kings room.  Soon thereafter, the leader of the Naggy raid (lvl52 Warrior) shows up in the same room and we invite him into the group while we wait for the others.<br><br>I ask whats the plan for the raid and get a short response back saying, &quot;I dunno, Prius is the leader for the Vox raid&quot;.  Ok.  I ask Prius where everyone is at since almost 2 hours have now passed since the plan to raid Vox was first announced.  After a while I get a response that everyone is on their way, they are just waiting on the level 60 and 65 buffers.  <br><br>This is the point where I began to really grow impatient.  I soon thereafter see test from Prius over the Vox channel asking if anyone KNEW of any 60 or 65 buffers who could help out.  KNEW??  I THOUGHT THIS WAS ALREADY A DONE DEAL!!  And of those who he said were already on the way, I think that after 1/2, there were maybe 2 or 3 other people in the Permafrost zone besides our group.<br><br>To make matters worse, the former raid leader who had joined the group was not even paying attention to the group.  He kept pulling mob after mob while the rest of us were trying to figure out what was going on.  One bad pull later (3 ice giants and the magus) and both Kaly and the warrior are dead and Brog and I are pulling the corpses back to the zoneline.<br><br>We rez our fallen comrades and I send a tell to Prius that it doesnt look like this is happening and Im just going to log.  I get a tell back pleading with me to stay, this is still happening and everyone is on the way.  The Vox channel was quite empty and everyone seemed to agree that this wasnt happening so I figured I would give it another half hour.  After that period had gone by I dejected told Brog and Kaly that I was just going to log and call it a night.<br><br>Thus went my first dragon raid.  Basically, it never materialized.  Having both led and participated in a number of raids with the Knights of Marr, I have come to expect at least a little organization and communication from the participants.  We had NONE of this in the Vox raid.  Had it been earlier in the evening and if I had more experience in leading dragon raids, I would have just usurped authority and organized this with Brog and Kaly.  As it is, I have never done a dragon raid and figured that the others had more experience with it.  I hate disorganization and I hate being misled even more.  I dont lay blame on anyone since organizing these raids is difficult but if I had seen some level of communication on the Vox channel, at least I would have known what was going on.<br><br>Oh well, hopefully this didnt go off and we can try again tonite.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri May 16 09:27:42 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

The next steps in my epic require me to put together a book of scale from the torn frost and fire books awarded as loot from both Vox and Nagafen.  In order to get those, Im going to have to join one of the raids to these dragons and hope my number comes up on the roll for the item.  <br><br>I believe my last journal posting was made at 44 or 45 and as such my raiding abilities were kind of limited.  Since then, I have been able to raise my abilities to 48 and could be considered a much more viable associate on one of these dragon raids.  The trouble is just finding out WHEN these raids occur.  Putting together a raid from within the guild isnt an option since the majority of us are over level 52, which is the maximum limit they are able to attack these weaker dragons.<br><br>In the time since my last entry, the Knights of Marr have furthered the efforts of our many clerics in their epic quests for the Sprinkler (clicky rez item).  The next step for Shorten, Heelyou and Heysus was to do that turn in and get Ixblat a HUGE fire elemental in Burning Wood to spawn.  <br><br>We got everyone together in the Burning Woods and counting all the KoM and friends in the zone, we put together just about 3 full groups.  The MT was a very high level warrior named Micromanaged and the rest of the adventurers consisted of a range of players from the mid 40s to the low 60s.  Our puller was the 60th level ranger named Curtis Bladegater, who also happened to be one of our guild leaders and the organizer of the raid.<br><br>The evening got started slowly, as everyone was a little confused as to where we were supposed to meet and who was going.  Once we got organzied, we moved to the Burning Woods zone close to the Skyfire zone exit and set up camp.  Our first cleric got in position next to the turn in mob, Curtis ran to the area where Ixblat was supposed to spawn and the rest of us readied our swords and spells.  Heelyou turned in the robe and gated back to the campspot while the rest of us anxiously awaited the arrival of Ix.  Curtis checked track and after about 5 minutes of not finding him eventually found him on track and moved in.  The next thing we hear from Curtis is, &quot;WHOA!  THATS A HUGE ASS FIRE ELEMENTAL!!&quot;.  I couldnt help but chuckle.<br><br>The wait on the pull back to the campspot was interminable as Curtis decided to stick a snare on Ixblat to pull him.  The problem was that Curtis was halfway across the zone when he did this and Ixblat decided to kill everything in his path.  Eventually, however, Ixblat DID arrive and our MT dove into action.  Sure enough, this was a HUGE ASS FIRE ELEMENTAL.<br><br>We had decided to have the MT stand on one side of Ixblat and have the rest of the melee'ers on the other side to minimize the AoE effect of Ixblats fire elemental form.  This worked perfectly and after a minute or so, Ixblat was dead and we were all alive.  We cheered Heelyou as he looted the sceptre.<br><br>The next go around for Shorten went swimmingly as well.  MT did his job, healers theirs and everyone survived yielding a sceptre for our short healer.  However, the respawn of the turnin mob for Ixblat was about 45 minutes to an hour so by this time, it was getting quite late and many of the raid had left.  Heysus arrived online late and since MIcromanaged had left, we chose the next MT in line who was Mystii a level 56 warrior (I think).  Heysus turned in the robe and Curtis once again pulled Ixblat into the area.<br><br>Mystii ran up and started fighting Ixblat and we followed in line but unfortunately, she succombed to Ixblat's wrath.  He turned on the next in line who was Gimillee the dwarf rogue and seeing his HPs dropping VERY fast, I cast a LOH on him hoping to spare him.  This only served to REALLY piss off Ixblat so he turned to me and in about 5 hits, took my 2500 hps down to nothing.   Next thing I see is <br><br>LOADING.....PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>Soon enough, he has slaughtered most of the raid and caused the rest to run for the zone exit.  The problem was that if we didnt get Heysus his sceptre, he would have to start the quest from the VERY BEGINNING.  Not wanting to do this, one of the raid members whos name escapes me now summoned the help of some of her guildies from The Armored Division.  We rezzed the fallen, rebuffed and were overjoyed to see 3 of her very high level guildies arrive on horseback.  It was quite impressive to see them arrive on their warhorses and even more impressive to know that one of them had even solo'd Ixblat.  We soon learned that the one who had solo'd Ixblat was actually one of the originators of the Knights of Marr and was formerly known as EboneKnight.<br><br>We got them into the raid and pulled Ixblat back towards the group.  This time with the help of The Armored Division, Ixblat went splat and Heysus was able to recover his scepter.  We all breathed a sigh of relief in knowing that Heysus's effort wasnt going to waste.<br><br>I have also grown significantly since the last journal entry.  I reached the magic age of 46 last week and was able to make my first journey into the Plane of Tranquility.  I have to admit it really was magical there with the lush growth and soothing music that emanated around me.  Its a shame such a zone cannot be experienced by younger adventurers.  I even took a short trip to a couple of the other planes to look around and found the Plane of Disease quite disgusting.  Looking around I could see what looked like hairs growing from the ground and discovered that the zone is infested with insect like monsters similar to ticks which would make sense for a plane of disease.  <br><br>Last weekend, we even managed to form a group in the Plane of Justice.  We grabbed Doormouse, Tulbil, myself, Brogain, Kalyaris, HPotter, Diiana and Sinyee and fought some of the creatures a ways into the zone.  The first two were easily taken care of but when Brogain tried to help Doormouse separate two mobs that had spawned so he could pull one, he pulled both unexpectly and was quickly rewarded with <br><br>LOADING...PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>The rest of us were soon to follow.   Once we recovered everyone's corpses (which was a fiasco in itself due to unwanted trains), we headed down the zone out area of PoJ and killed there for a little while before the area became so crowded with other people that we decided to leave.<br><br>We decided at that point to head back into Dulak to see if we could get some spell of Heelyou's which was part of a quest.  Earlier in the day we had spent considerable time in Gunthak and Dulak getting the quest spells for Sinyee, Swiftarrow and myself and had a pretty good idea of what to expect in the zone.  We even had 2 full groups formed and ready to go in Dulak.  Now all we had to do was find the deepwater emblem which was supposed to be dropped by one of the boat engineers.<br><br>When we got to Dulak we found that most of the boats were already camped.  We decided to go from boat to boat under invisibility to see if there was one boat that was uncamped.  We eventually found one tied up to dock #6 and cautiously made our way up the gangplank.  At this time we found out that Whitebalis had been spotted down on the docks below and some of us lost the invisibility as we rushed to her aid despite Curtis's warnings.  Once we left the relative safe confines of the invisibility spell of our bards, we attracted the unwanted attention of just about the whole bow of the ship and found ourselves in quite the battle.  We somehow managed to kill off most of the pirates  but found ourselves in more trouble when a badly injured pirate who was fleeing was able to escape our swords long enough to attract the attention of the rest of the ship.  The rest of us died at that point.<br><br>Yesterday, I was even able to see where the Paladin really shines solo and it is no surprise to know that it is against undead.  We had a raid planned for 8PM to head to the City of Mist and not wanting to get wrapped up in a group I would have to leave shortly, I decided to try my hand at soloing the undead skeletons in The Dreadlands.  I went to the small set of ruins in the NE corner of the zone and found that with my new Ethereal Healing spell, I was able to solo them one at a time with a minimum loss of health and downtime.  I later found out once the skeletons had been dispatched from this area that there were more undead in the Lost Valley by the Ancient Combine temple and worked on those for a while as well.  The experience was fantastic and they fell one after another to my sword with no down time.  <br><br>Im just hoping now that Sinyee and Brogain dont get too far ahead of us in levels.  They are leaving Kaly, HPotter, Swiftarrow, Diiana and I behind.  Im gonna have to create a secret monk character and train them so they lose a few levels :)<br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

They are the ones who first brought me into Echo Caverns and showed a young shaman how fun fites with the Taskmaster and his spawn can be.  They are the ones who I normally group with and who I can depend on for safety.  Finally, they are the ones who helped a 44th level paladin of Marr finally get his Soulfire.<br><br>Mind you, Im not just thankful only for my own boon.  Yes, I've spent plenty of time acquiring the necessary faction to successfully complete this quest and spent plenty of time doing the odd and menial jobs to prepare for this moment. On the contrary, what I'm really thankful for is being allowed to be a part of not one but THREE epic battles fought during the previous nights adventures.  Not only did they assist me in defeating the treacherous Sir Lucan D'Lere, former Paladin of Marr himself, who had allowed himself to be corrupted by hate and power but they also got 2 Blood Soaked Plasmatic Cloaks from the Plasmatic priest in the Temple of Solusek Ro for both Heelyou and Shortens Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh, their epic item.<br><br>The raid was postponed from the previous evening when it was found that Sir Lucan was no where to be found after helping Dulentik fight off an invading force of RyGorr Invaders led by Scarbrow in pursuit of his 5th Coldain ring.  Since Lucan was not around and it was getting late, we decided to postpone it until the following evening when we might have a better chance of finding Lucan.<br><br>The following day, one of the guild leaders Curtis Bladegater, scheduled a rather impromptu raid for both the robe and Lucan's testament.  The raid would be formed at the druid stones inside of Lavastorm and one by one, our guild began arriving at the rally spot.  Groups were formed and by the time we were to move out, I looked around to see almost 3 full groups of Knights of Marr assembled.  It was truly a proud moment for me knowing that I was a part of this troop assembled on short notice just for the reason of coming to the assistance of one of the members.<br><br>We ventured into the Temple of Solusek Ro and were led by Miggy Stardust who had done the turn in a while back.  Our clerics would do the turn in and then bring the priest back to the entrance of the temple where we were assembled.  Just before the turn in was to be done, we ran into our first bump in the road.  The group was feeling pretty confident at this time and friendly banter errupted between Swiftarrow and Hpotter.  Knowing they couldn't truly hurt each other with spells, Swiftarrow cast a lightning bolt on HPotter, instantly drawing the ire of one of the keepers guarding the entrance to the temple.  The keepers then attacked Swiftarrow who was then healed by Hpotter who was then the target of the keepers wrath.  A bit of confusion broke out and rather than kill the keepers who had attacked, everyone ran for the exit bruised and bewildered.<br><br>We reentered the temple and this time made sure that no area of effect spells like lightning were used in the battle to come.  This actually proved to be a fortunate event for us since Swift had planned to use his lightning in the course of the battle against the plasmatic priest and had no clue it would also hit the normally indifferent keepers.  Having to deal with the nasty spells of the keepers while trying to take down the priest could add quite a bit more difficulty to our encounter.<br><br>After we reorganized and got our clerics and pullers in position, the time was upon us.  Heelyou turned in his Coral Statue of Tarew, and ran as fast as his little dwarf legs could carry him back to the group awaiting.  Despite the fact that the priest was a fairly high level caster, the rumor that he could not be stunned and thus interrupted was found to be untrue.  As Whitebalis, Doormouse, Swiftarrow and the many other melee types in the group hacked away at his life, I would cast one of my stuns his way as soon as I saw him casting.  Throughout the entire battle, I believe he only got one spell off on himself and went down without major difficulty.  We all cheered as Heelyou removed the bloodstained cloak from the dead plasmatic priest.<br><br>After much celebration and congratulatory remarks, we decided to redo the quest for our other healer in the raid, Shorten.  This time around, we somehow had engaged the ire of the nearby keepers and after dealing the killing blow to the priest had to leave the zone to prevent anyones death.  I found myself hit by a near 700hp nuke from one of the keepers after I had healed our younger bard Toonz, whos health was dropping precipitously low.  Eventually, however, Shorten got his robe as well.<br><br>We then sent Tulanyeni a younger druid of ours to Freeport to check on the whereabouts of Lucan.  She arrived in town and found him plotting the downfall of my beloved Knights of Truth guild and relayed the fact to the rest of us.  We immediately began heading towards W Freeport to take down that dastardly fiend.<br><br>Having arrived in Freeport, we split our numbers into two groups.  One willing to take a nasty faction hit with the corrupt guards of E and W Freeport and one set aside for a support role if needed.  The plan was to pull Lucan near the E Commonlands zoneline so that those who didnt want to take a faction hit could zone out before the killing blow was dropped.<br><br>Doormouse, a very experienced monk and one who has pulled Lucan before, volunteered for that duty once again and asked if everyone was ready.  Having been given the go ahead signal he pulled Lucan out of his headquarters and began making his way out of the city towards us awaiting him at the zone.  As I watched the events unfolding, I saw our scarlet monk running out of the west gates of Freeport with about 6 angry guards chasing him.  I singled out Lucan began hailing him furiously as Doormouse dragged the rest of the guards well away from our position.  <br><br>Now that Lucan was isolated, his death was guaranteed.  With all the help we had knocking his health down, he was hardly a threat and as his hps dropped, the order to zone for those not wanting the faction hit was given.  He died shortly thereafter, spawning his true evil form, that of an undead skeleton.  This too fell quickly and we erupted into cheer as I looted Lucan's Testament of Truth, the item I needed to return to Valeron Dushire in the Hall of Truth for the Shining Blade of Truth, the final item for Soulfire.<br><br>Now on a roll, having captured 3 epic pieces in 3 raids, Ee then discussed what to do next.  Heysus needed to kill Ixblat, a dangerous fire elemental in the Burning Wood but soon found that even with our group, he might be a bit much to handle.  It was getting late at this time and people were starting to log.<br><br>I was quite anxious to complete this quest and only needed to turn the items into Brother Hayle in the Splitpaw jail.  Splitpaw is a gnoll lair hidden inside a burrow within South Karana and was originally a high teens - low 20s dungeon years ago.  The previous inhabitants were replaced by more dangerous gnolls, consisting of many caster types among their meleers.  This made the trip into Splitpaw that much more dangerous since a train of greens can still kill a red if there are enough of them.<br><br>I asked Brogain and Kalyaris if they were up for a very short adventure before they logged and was overjoyed to learn that they would assist me in finishing Soulfire.  We took the Antonica Spires in Nexus to E Karana and then crossed over the bridge in beautiful weather to South Karana.  <br><br>The speed song of Kaly's made the trip to Splitpaw short and sweet and we ventured inside, being forced to step over a couple corpses of adventures who had fallen to the deadly trains this lair was known for.  I wanted to complete this quest as quick as possible and without further bloodshed so the plan was to use Kalys song of invisibility to travel into the depths of Splitpaw oblivious to the angry eyes of its inhabitants.<br><br>This got us across the bridge and to the second door leading to the jail.  Something, however had spotted us and we soon had to fight 4 gnolls at once.  The battle wasnt dangerous for us but perhaps a bit protracted since there was a healer hidden somewhere who kept healing the mobs as they were about to die.  Eventually, however, we prevailed and after medding back the mana we had used, we headed into the jail area where Brother Hayle was being held.<br><br>Once we reached the jail, I instructed Kaly to stay outside by the lever that opened the doors so that she could let us back out and had Brogain come inside with me to operate the lever which opened Brother Hayles cell.  Having found Brother Hayle being held in the furthest back cell, I went in and hailed him after Brogain opened the cell door for me.<br><br>I turned in the note I had acquired from Highkeep and was instructed that I was indeed worthy of the Soulfire blade but that I needed to turn in my Testimony of Truth, the hilt from Xicotl in Mistmoore and the Shining Blade I had received for turning in Lucan's Testimony of Truth.  I handed all these items to Brother Hayle along with the note I gave him originally and was overjoyed as I now saw in my inventory a flaming 2 handed sword named Soulfire.  Finally, my Soulfire quest was complete.<br><br>I equipped the sword and stared at it for what seemed like hours, thankful for all the support I got from my friends in the Knights of Marr.  Wanting Kaly and Brog to be the first to actually see it, I headed back out with flaming sword in hand and swung it back and forth watching as the flames danced along its honed edge.  The blade unfortunately will be more of a status symbol for me, however, since it wont replace my Runed Frost Blade anytime soon but sure looks nice for ceremonial occasions.  As the three of us reformed , we headed back out the Nexus portal to log for the evening.<br><br>As we were sitting at the spires awaiting our port back to the Nexus, we ran across an unequipped magician who was on a corpse retrieval to Najena.   Having been so overjoyed with all the help I recieved in my quest for Soulfire, I felt like giving something back to others in need.  I offered my services to retrieve her corpse and escorted her back to the entrance of Najena.  I told her to wait at the entrance where the rest of her party was waiting and ventured inside to retrieve her lifeless body which I then brought back to her at the entrance.  I dont know which made me feel better at this moment, my pride over Soulfire or the reward she graciously offered me for the help I provided.  Having gotten all the help for Soulfire free of charge, it wasnt right for me to accept her pittance for the work any honorable paladin should normally offer.<br><br>The satisfaction of the entire evening was award enough.</p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

The ToD was a great choice for that since the difficulty of the goblins there was a perfect match for the expected levels of our raid attendees.  <br><br>The plan was to have everyone meet outside the ToD at 9PM sharp so that we could have a good 3 hours of raiding inside.  I had planned to fight our way to Chief Rutgus's ledge hoping to snag a couple of  Idols of the Thorned for our party.  I had been looking for a replacement to my Goranga Idol and this would have been a perfect replacement for it.  Im sure I wasnt the only melee type hoping to grab this :)<br><br>Our first snag of the evening, however, didnt even occur inside the temple and delayed the start of the raid by about an hour.  I had assumed everyone would know where the ToD was and could safely find their way there to rally.  This was my first lapse in judgement and resulted in the untimely death of Monkay, a low 30th level monk who had tried to travel there with Toonz and Weelesprechon.  It took a good while to find Monkays corpse and get him rezzed and in the meantime, Weelesprechon said he had to go.  Eventually we got Monkay rezzed and  moved to the entrance to ToD and I made a mental note to have my future rally spots in well travelled safe areas to minimize this downtime.  Chalk one up to experience.<br><br>We formed two groups, one melee based and one caster based.  We were lucky to have two bards in our group so our tanks could benefit from Kalyaris' melee songs and our casters could regen mana faster with Toonz's mana song.   Our melee group consisted of myself, Swiftarrow, Kalyaris, Punchybob, Monkay and Heelyou and our caster group consisted of Sinyee, Hpotter, Brogain, Toonz and Aznar who would pull any adds off of our casters. This party format has worked well for us in the past and hopefully would work well for us now.<br><br>We entered the temple and once inside the main room, I pointed out a ledge in front of us with a tunnel behind it and told the group that once we go in, that the way out is much different.  This wouldnt be an issue since we all had maps and we had scouted out the exit in a smaller group a few days earlier.  Little did we know.<br><br>As the highest level and most sturdy tank in the melee group, I became the main assist (MA) and would pull the goblins back to the rest of the group after Soothing the surrounding goblins to minimize what we had to attack at any one time.  This worked perfectly throughout the entire evening and I cant begin to describe how well our raid took down even the tougher pulls involving multiple goblins.  Aznar was a great benefit in the caster group as he quickly regained agro from any stray goblins who felt they needed to attack the casters.  The battles were fast and furious and even better, quite safe.  Having two clerics in the raid was quite a benefit as we were never in any mortal danger during the raid portion of the evening.<br><br>We made our way through the temple using the soothe/pull routine and found quite a few items which we divvied through the raid.  We found an Eye of Milnoc off some named mob which had 10 charges of Identify as well as a Wisdom benfit as well as a Mantle of Mirth off of Soothsayer Dregzak.  We eventually sold the Mantle to a vendor for 45PP since no one wanted it and the stats were just mediocre.  A little further in we even grabbed a Whip of Strangulation and a Circlet of Shadows for Toonz and Sinyee.  Its quite odd seeing Sinyee, a necromancer, with an armored cap :)<br><br>We eventually made it to the Chief's ledge and were a tad disappointed after clearing the area that the Chief was not up.  Our plan was to camp the area and clear the surrrounding mobs until he spawned but alas, we were in for a setback.  Swiftarrow had told us earlier that he would have to log at midnight but we convinced him to come anyway, not really thinking how we would get him out when the time came for him to leave.<br><br>We eventually decided that we would form a small group of me, Swift and Kalyaris to sneak out without fighting using Kaly's invis song.  This worked well through about 80% of the way out but ended up in a fiasco as we were spotted by a Goblin Stalagknight who could obviously see thru our invisibility.  We tried dispatching him but soon found ourselves beset by 5 other goblins at the same time.  We tried to run out the rest of the way but all three soon fell, almost within sight of the exit.<br><br>Getting the rest of the raid out safely called for some creative thinking.  It was soon decided to have Sinyee and Hpotter gate out so that they could form a new group with Brogain, Heelyou, Toonz, Monkay and Punchybob which would then sneak out as far as they could without fighting.  They made it to the Stalagnight who spotted him, dispatched him and the other monsters and found our corpses laying at the top of the tunnels.  A little bit later, the brave adventurers rezzed their fallen comrades and left the confines of the Temple of Droga.<br><br>All in all, we called it a successful evening, having gotten some nice items and loot and much wiser for the experience.  I think Ive learned that its much safer to organize the raid in a relatively safe area and then move en masse to the raid location than to try to organize the raid outside the spot in question and I've also learned how deadly it can be to help someone leave a raid before its done.  Live (or die) and learn :)<br><br>I also was able to try out my new Silver Chitin Hand Wraps which I saved up for multiple levels now and got quite a bargain for them at 3150PP.  Ive seen them going for anywhere from 3200PP to 3900PP and was lucky to find them when I did.  Im thinking of spots for our next raid and am eagerly eyeing the Temple of Frozen Shadows, a primarily undead zone.  Pally's should rock there!<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

This was being done in preparation for my previously mentioned Soulfire class.  I was already &quot;kindly&quot; with them and it took 6 stacks more to bring my faction up to &quot;warmly&quot; where it needs to be.  To bring me to this point I think I spent about 2-300PP and used up about 10-12 stacks of bonechips to raise faction from whereever us Freeporters start to warmly.  Oh well....I think Im ready to continue on with the quest.<br><br>As the evening progressed, we began discussing where we would adventure.  I dont remember WHO it was who suggested Kael but after much discussion, it was decided we would head to Kael and fight storm giants.  It was originally going to be just us lowbies consisting of myself, Swiftwarrow, HPotter, Diiana, Brogain, Kalyaris, and Sinyee and having 7 of us, we decided to break out into our standard raid format consisting of two groups...one with healer and meleers and the second consisting of the casters.<br><br>As we were trying to get organized, an inquiring Duuthraka (short little gnomish necro type) asks the guild if hes needed anywhere.  Normally Im one of the people who are most confident of our abilities but having never beeen here before, I wasnt about to turn down the offer for assistance from a 50-something level necro.  We add Duuth to the casters group and head into Kael.<br><br>It was at this point that our ranger Swift became lost.  Hes not the only ranger in our guild who seems to have this &quot;direction deficit disorder&quot;.  I wonder if the people who play rangers are directionally challenged in RL and thus choose them thinking their tracking skills will counter their real life disabilities.  Regardless, once we recoverd our lost-Ranger &quot;Swift&quot; we head down to fight the two guards outside and finish them off quite easily.  One of the guards conned yellow to me and the other conned red.  After the smackdown we laid on them, I didnt doubt our abilities (much anyway) anymore.<br><br>I had originally thought that Kael would be nearly devoid of players.  Im not sure why I thought this but you dont normally see PoK spam from players &quot;Forming Kael Group...LFM&quot; like you do many other fighting areas.  Upon zoning inside, I see quite a few high level peeps (all red to me) sitting at the zoneline doing who knows what.  Sinyee suggests we do a /who and take a look at the average level player in the zone.  We were shocked to see that there was not another 40th level (much less LOW 40th level) character in the zone much less an entire group composed almost entirely of them.  Seeing this, I began to have second doubts about whether or not we could do this.<br><br>I also had a chance to see and talk to a LONG lost friend here while we were waiting at the zoneline.  I turn to my right and see a female gnome named Devynne standing in the zone.  Devynne is an alt for Kassil, the RL and in-game wife of Dexter Aldertree, original founder of the first guild I was in &quot;El Norma&quot; and MMORPG fanatic-extraordinaire.  Dex and I have known each other since 1996 and have stayed in touch since.  He was the one who originally told me about EQ and got me to purchase it when it first came out and we had a pretty consisten EQ group going very much like the one we got going now.  We all fought as a team and enjoyed each others company above all else.  Dex has since been out of EQ for quite some time and each new MMORPG that has come out, Dex and I always wound up together.  Dex's new game is the Star Wars Galaxy exclusive beta and I had Kassil pull Dex over to her keyboard so I could give him a little friendly crap.  On a side note: all exclusive beta testers got two free SWG open beta accounts (one for them and one for a friend) and Dex has given me his other one.  Coming soon, I shall get to experience the Star Wars Universe for myself:)<br><br>I said my goodbyes to Kassil when the group was ready to head in and trotted down the hallway to recruiter giant at the end of the hallway.  We decided to skip attacking this one since he was on a different faction than the others we would soon meet.  A bit further down the hall, we came to a long bridge guarded by two frost giants on either side.  We used our standard Soothe/Pull tactic to pull one at a time and dealt with each one in turn.  Heading across the bridge, we did the same thing to the giants on the other side and realized that these giants might post a bit more of a challenge since they were casters and these giants could not be stunned and thus interrupted.  Their spellcasting ability, however, didnt pose much of a threat to such an awesome group.<br><br>We continued our soothe/pull approach at the bridge and continued our giant killing until we saw Whitebalis ask what was going on.  We invited her to join us so that we might be able to increase our abilities even further.   Once she arrived, we headed further in when she and Duuthraka figured we could handle tougher giants.  We worked our way down the tunnel to the bottom of the shaft which opened up into an enourmous cavern populated with a sundry of yellow and red storm giants.  These giants seemed much more advanced than the mountain giants we'd fought in the Frontier Mountains having carved elabrately decorated buildings out of the bedrock within the cavern.<br><br>We decided to start off slow to see what we could handle and pulled one of the Watchers which was blue to me.  Again, we found these were easily handled.  I had handed the pulling duties over to White, deferring to her knowledge of the area and we continued our massacre of the giants.  The group even managed to successfully fite two Watchers at once when a couple pulls attracted the attention of nearby mobs.  <br><br>Feeling pretty good about ourselves, we pressed our attack.  Whitebalis disappeared around the corner to the left and headed into one of the giant buildings for another pull.  As she came running back out with a giant sorcerer on her tail, she returned to the group and decided to confront Sinyee while the rest of us attacked the sorcerer.  This is where things turned sour.  After about 10 seconds, Sinyee began yelling on Roger Wilco to root and attack her.   When it finally dawned on the rest of us that she had been possessed and had been actually attacking Sinyee, Brogain and I began cancelling magic on her to rid her of that curse.  Unfortunately, Sinyee couldnt withstand the furious blows inflicted upon him by his former group-mate and passed away.  Fortunately, we were able to bring Whitebalis back to reality and purge the charm and we finished off the sorcerer, a bit smarter and better prepared if another situation like this were to arise.<br><br>Once Sinyee was revived, and the group healed we returned to killing more manageable mobs.  Whitebalis continued pulling and declined my offer to assist her with my Soothe line.  This is one thing we would soon regret as she once again had a pull go awry.  Right before she pulled, she mentioned we MIGHT get two and before we could reply we saw her incoming with Captain Bvellos and another sorcerer.  Try as we might, we just couldnt get a handle on the situation and suffered our first-ever TPW (total party wipeout).  Dejected, bruised and beaten we were saved from major experience loss by the high level heals of Heelyou, one of the outstanding high level clerics in our fabulous guild.  We vowed vengence and added him to our melee group and shifted Brogain, our original cleric to watch over the casters.<br><br>Soon thereafter we were joined by Joaqime (sp?) one of our high level paladins who had helped me get the hilt from Xicotl in Mistmoore along with Tulbil and Gaiele a week or so prior.  We figured if we were going to get payback, more firepower would be necessary.<br><br>After rebuffs for everyone, pulling duties shifted from Whitebalis to Joaqime since he could withstand a slightly heavier beating.  Hpotter had logged a while back and Swift had just left the giant fort but was still on Roger Wilco and was looking at the list of monsters in Kael on Ilia's bestiary to see what else is in there.  Joq decided to head off into a building in front and to the right of us and said he had a named mob in front of him who was red.  He asked if he should pull and we tried to get the name of the mob from him before he pulled so Swift could tell us what we were in for.  He must have missed our question cause after some debate we decided to try to kill it and he pulled.  When I clicked the assist button to see what he had attacked, I noticed the name of the mob was Kellek Felhammer and relayed that information to Swift.  My jaw dropped when I found out Joq had just pulled a level 60 mob and I pulled out my rosarie beads and began to recite my last rights.<br><br>The battle was fast and furious and I found out the hard way that Felhammer (actually a merchant in Kael) could hit me multiple times for 200 a pop.  We had decided earlier that all the tanks (Whitebalis and I) would wait for his signal before attacking.  Before I even began attacking him, he was smacking anyone who was anywhere close to him.  Fortunately we had the uber healing ability of Heel in the group which brought even the staunchest warrior back to full health from near-death.  <br><br>Amazingly, this uber-mob eventually fell to our blows.  We whooped and hollared and were amazed that a group consisting of mostly low-40s could bring down a much tougher mob.  Granted we had the likes of White, Joq, Duuth and Heelyou to do most of the work but bringing down such a significantly tougher mob was quite satisfying.  Unfortunately, his corpse &quot;poofed&quot; as he died leaving us with no experience and no loot for the effort.  Regardless, it was quite a victory.<br><br>One of the best parts of having a paladin pull is the ability to use the soothe line of spells to pull individual monsters to the group, thus decreasing the risk of a bad pull.  Most groups dont ever take advantage of such an ability and the fact that a high level paladin like Joq was in the group made our pulls much easier.  Once we told him that giants can indeed be soothed we rarely had any problem with the pulls.<br><br>Note I said rarely, the next fight Im about to discuss happened so fast that Im not exactly sure what happened.  I do know however that we got 2 fairly high level giants one of which was (Noble Hessen) in the pull one of which happened to be a caster.  As combat ensued, the melee'ers attacked one mob while the casters parked the second.  These giants had very high magic resistance and as such, broke root very quickly.  As the tanks were beating on the first, I noticed the second run up to Heelyou and start wacking on him while the first was being hit.  Not wanting Heelyou to fall in combat, I ran up to the giant attacking him and taunted him back off saving Heelyou and giving him the time he needed to fully heal Joq who was near death.  Unfortunately, the ire I drew from that giant was such that I quickly fell to his blows and White and Joq finished the first off and I once again found myself in PoK where I was bound.  Fortunately, the time I bought the group by removing him from Heel was enough to finish off the second.  Even tho I died, I felt victorious that I was able to sacrifice myself for the rest of the group.  Additionally, we looted something called the Scale of Hselga which is an item used in a wizard spell quest.  Fortunately we were save because if Heel had died, we would have had another total party wipeout. <br><br>When I was eventually returned to the group, I noticed the lack of Duuthraka.  Looking in the text buffer I noticed the following quote from Duuth, &quot;I AM SO SCREEEWWWD!!&quot;  Asking what the matter was, we found out how dire the situation actually was.  He had been summoned by one of the storm giants into some room and was now feigning death while being surrounded by 4 red giants to him.  This was perhaps the most comical part of the evening.  <br><br>Taking advantage of Duuth's vulnerability, we all started making fun of his situation.  Reference to Star Trek, Rocky, and other famous movies were thrown his way knowing that if he even tried to move he was in for a smackdown.  Even Duuth was laughing at the dire situation.  We decided at this point that the best way to handle this would be to have Gaiele log her magician in and summon the helpless gnome back to the group.  Once this was done and Duuth was back in safety, we called it a night and headed out Kael.<br><br>It was quite an evening of adventure.  Giants galore and a chance to group with the infamous Duuthraka.  I enjoy getting a chance to know others from the guild better and although we've exchanged reparte in guildchat before, it was much more fun experiencing it in person.  Although the actual xps and loot gained from the mini-raid was minimal, the sheer enjoyment I got from experiencing something new made for a wonderful evening.<br><br>Im so close to 42, however, that its time to get back into an experience grind. :)<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Apr 11 10:52:44 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

It was just us &quot;lowbies&quot; and unlike the former, the majority of mobs we fought were blue to us.<br><br>We buffed and formed up in Greater Faydark and began to run southwest towards Mistmoore.  Aside from the camp of Teir'Dal Elite I stirred up but thankfully outran, the trip to Mistmoore was uneventful.<br><br>Forming up outside the castle, we formulated a plan of attack which would be to fight our way to the front door of the castle.  Without a 'chanter, crowd control would be handled by me with my Soothe capability so everyone would stay behind me until I called for them forward.  This plan of action was tested as soon as we reached the front gate.<br><br>Dealing with the deathly ushers and initiates at the bottom of the chasm, I told everyone to stay put while I soothed the mobs on top.  Im not sure what happened here...maybe I forgot that Gdaien was NOT on voice chat with us and I only gave that command in voice but as Im soothing up top, I see the shape of a ranger shoot past me and into the waiting embraces of 5 evil creatures up top.   No sooner does this happen than everyone else comes shooting up here as well.  Gdaien must have really riled them up since his hitpoints dropped so quick, neither Brogain nor I had the time to heal or Lay of Hands him and his soul passed this mortal plane.<br><br>By this time, the number of mobs had increased significantly and we were probably battling 8 or 9  blues with an occasional green and everyones hitpoints were being depleted.  Add to the fact that a named skeleton named Sir Bronthas was pounding on us and I thought we were done for.  I tried to get everyone to head back to the zone while I tried to grab agro with my undead nukes but Brogain would have none of it.  We debated furiously about sacrificing the life of one to save the rest but no one would have it.  If one should fall, all will fall.  <br><br>We continued battling with me Expelling Undead, Kaly and Swift hacking away and Hpotter and Brogain healing when necessary.  I did use a Lay of Hands on Kaly once when I was unsure whethers Brogains complete heal would hit in time but despite my doubts we prevailed battered and bruised but alive and well.  Without Gdaien I doubted the ability of us to defeat a force of superior numbers but in the end, our might overcame that adversity.  I completely underestimated the ability of a low 40s high 30s group to deal with the dangers of Mistmoore.  It was something that I wouldn't underestimate the rest of the evening.<br><br>We rezzed and healed up and restated the plan that I would pull from inside the house and that everyone was to stay until I give the notice to move up.  Most of these creatures were successfully soothed so we were able to clear up to the foyer without any major battles.  At this point, we moved our camp into the foyer where I would pull to.<br><br>From this point on, there isnt really much of significance to talk about.  We learned a couple things during our stay here.  First of all, casters need to be dealt with first.  During one battle with multiple casters we found one caster that we were beating on was constantly being healed by the other.  We switched a couple meleers from the first caster to the healer and quickly finished them both off.  Second of all, we found that we could handle even the worst pulls with good communication.  There were times where we had to deal with 7 or 8 mobs at a time and when this happened, mobs would agro our healers which was quickly dealt with when Brog and Hpotter told us they were under attack.  Our melee force quickly switched targets to regain agro and kept our healers safe.  Finally, we learned that we didnt have to endure long pulls such as those in OT or DL to get good experience and loot for our levels.   Essence of Moonlight, Fine Steel Weapons and Gargoyle Eyes could all be sold for good money and a couple of dinged during the evening. We also fought our way into the ballroom and got Kaly her very own Gypsy Lute for her lambent quest.<br><br>The only notable event of the evening was our exit from the castle.  As we were moving out of the foyer and back towards the gate, Gdaien must have seen me warp towards the gate and ran in front of me while I was soothing the guards at the gate.  Rather than fiting them one at a time, we found ourselves fighting 4 at once but these were easily dealt with.  A couple of battles later and we were back at the zone and saw the corpses of Wolfkins and Diiana lying there.  I still dont know what exactly they ran into...whatever it was it must have been nasty.<br><br>We rez our fallen comrades and decide to call it a night.  Diiana and Wolfie decided to camp at the zoneline so they wont have to run far to join us tonite when we come here again while the rest of us decided to run back to the Felwithe book so we could sell our loot and lighten our pockets a bit.<br><br>Im going to have to take a look at the Mistmoore maps in preparation for venturing further inside.  I need 2 cauldrons from the Mistmoore cooks and Im not exactly sure where they are located.  Hopefully its somewhere we can handle.  Seeing how we prevailed so far, I doubt there is much that stands in our way here.  We shall soon see!<br></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

Truth be told, I felt the same way but hour upon hour of safe pulls just for the sake of experience just wont cut it.  Although I love Sinyee, HPotter, Swift, Brogain and Kaly to death....I had to do something with a bit more palpable results :)<br><br>Off and on for the last few weeks, Ive been looking into a strange paladin only sword named Soulfire and working on increasing my faction within Qeynos and Freeport which was recommended by Skifire, another paladin in our guild.  Apparently Soulfire is part of an &quot;epic&quot; quest for the Fiery Avenger and is supposed to be an upgrade to my first quested weapon Ghoulbane.  Although the stats of Soulfire are nice, it wasn't going to replace my Sword of the Morning. Figuring Im going to have to do it sooner or later, I might as well get it out of the way.<br><br>The first task at hand was to find the giver of the quest itself.  This was a problem, however, since my sources differed in how to go about getting the quest.  Some sources didnt even mention how to start the quest and just assumed you had a weapons list for Zimel's Blades.  Undaunted, I figured I would check within my guild headquarters in Freeport to see if I could find anything out on my own.  <br><br>Finding out nothing from the first couple of people I spoke with, I ventured out back behind the guild and spoke briefly with a man named Merko Quetalis who wanted me to help Altunic Jartin in the West Commonlands.  Swiftarrow offered to help me track this individual and finding him quickly,  I tell him I am there to help at which point he asks for a tunic to help him defend himself better.  Having bought one prior to talking to him, I offered the tunic and was then told that he needed help with a thief named Squire Narl who had been harrasing him of late.  Swift and I followed Altunic back to his hut and found Squire Narl again ready to pounce.  He was no match for the Weighty Polearm I wielded and in one swift blow was decapitated.  I took the head and gave it back to Altunic as proof of Narl's death and was given a Token of Generosity for my assistance.<br><br>Showing the token to Merko, he asked if I was ready to continue with the test.  I nodded my head and was then told to fetch him a spider venom sack as proof of my worthiness.  Having killed many of these spiders in the Deserts of Ro and giving these sacks to Sinyee for his poison making skill, I knew I was worthy of the quest.  Hpotter happened to have one on him at the time so he gave me the venom sac which was turned into Merko.  To prove my allegiance to the Temple, I was now to kill a traitorous guard named Willia, hiding in the nearby sewars.  Confronting her, she pleaded for her life saying that she was coerced into duty with the vile Freeport Militia by Sir Lucan.  Although it may be true, she had already condemned her fate by killing Merko's wife and was also quickly dispatched.  I looted the Token of Truth off of her and showed it to Merko.  He then asked for both tokens back in return for proof of my nobleness in form of the Testament of Truth.<br><br>I then explored further through the guild and talked to Kalatrina Plosskin who asked if I was worthy of her quest.  After telling her I was indeed worthy, she asked me to find a Temple of Truth spy within the Freeport Milita so that I could give him a letter letting him know his mother was sick.  Finding him behind the Freeport Militia headquarters, I gave him the note and got a price list from Zimels Blades which was hidden in Sir Lucan's quarters.  I was told to report back to Kalatrina Plosskin in the Temple of Truth and was then asked to show this to Rashinda Elore in the Office of the People in N Freeport.  She told me that Zimels Blades was a weapons shop in N Freeport subsequently bought by Groflah Steadirt and that they used to be good friends.  I headed off to see what Groflah knew about this Zimels Blades.<br><br>Arriving at Groflah's Forge, I spoke with Groflah who nervously told me that we could not talk here and that he wanted me to meet him at the Seafarers Roost in E Freeport later.  Later that evening, I arrived at the Roost and after waiting a number of hours saw Groflah enter and presented him the pricelist.  He looked at it and deciphered a bit of it and told me that he and Zimel saw an evil knight wielding some sword a while back.  Despite my best efforts I could not get any more information from him but was told that he really missed Tumpy Tonics which he used to drink in Kaladim.  My guess is that with a couple more Tumpy Tonics, I can loosen his tongue a bit more.<br><br>Going by my information sources, I knew I needed two other items for Soulfire, the Hilt of Soulfire and the Brilliant Sword of faith.  The Hilt was being held by Xicotl, an evil Shadow Knight in Castle Mistmoore and the sword could be found on Sir Lucan.  The easiest item to get at this point would be the Hilt so I asked our guild for some asssistance in obtaining it.<br><br>It was at this point that my call for help was answered by two of the more senior members of our guild, Gaiele the Magician and Tulbil the Ranger.  Both were very familiar with Mistmoore and were sure we could handle it on our own.  We formed up in Lesser Faydark and headed off towards the Castle.  It was at this point that another high ranking guildmember named Joaquin offered to join us.  He was a paladin himself and was very familiar with the location of Xicotl within Mistmoore.  This was good since I had only been in Mistmoore once long ago and never went any further than the secret entrance to the jail within the cemetary.<br><br>Once we were formed up, we headed up to the front door of the castle and were mobbed by about 4 or 5 deathly ushers and other monsters who tried to prevent our entrance into the castle.  After they were all dead, I was pretty confident in our abilities to handle anything within the castle.<br><br>We began making our way inside and found ourselves in the ballroom.  We heard the pleading of a Gypsy Dancer who pleaded with us to help her leave the place but was attacked by her anyway.  What a great way to ask for help by attacking your would-be rescuers.  After a ferocious battle, the ballroom was littered with the corpses of gypsy musicians one of which held a Gypsy Lute which was needed by Kaly for her lambent armor quest.  We looted this one assuming we would help Kaly multiquest it later.  She and Brogain were unable to join us at the time since they were still in the Dreadlands with Sinyee, Swift and Diiana.<br><br>We began moving towards the bedroom and spa where Xicotl was supposed to be hiding and ran into quite a group of gargoyles, ushers and other more deadly mobs.  This fight proved to be one of the more challenging of the evening as Gaiele found herself mobbed by quite a few monsters.  Even with her powerful spells, her hitpoints were falling very quickly and not wanting to lose Gaiele at this point I quickly healed her with my Lay on Hands.  We quickly regained the upper hand and soon finished off the remaining threats.  As part of the loot, we found a robe which Gaiele looted for a lower lever character of hers.<br><br>We made our way into the bedroom and began waiting for Xicotl to arrive.  During the meantime, we killed quite a few Gargoyles some of which contained the valued mistmoore granite which I needed for my armor of Ro quests.  During the evening I think we happened upon 5 or 6 of these which should be all I need for that armor.  <br><br>It was getting late and Kaly and Brog's group in the Dreadlands was disbanding so the two decided to join us in Mistmoore.  Once they reached the zone, Tulbil hid himself in camoflage and snuck back out of the castle to meet them at the zone.  Once they were in the group, Gaiele summoned the three of them back to us within the bedroom using her Call of Heroes spell.  I'll have to find a way to repay Gaiele since that spell uses an expensive pearl for each cast.<br><br>We continue wiping out all the spawns, now with ease and eventually find Xicotl inside his spa.  He was probably the toughest monster we fought all evening but our might prevailed and I had my Hilt.  YEEEEHAAAAA!<br><br>We decided to head back out and see if we could find another Lute for Kaly so she wouldnt have to multiquest it.  We headed back down to the ballroom and waited for the gypsy musician to spawn.  We were disappointed that the first set of musicians didnt have the lute but were rewarded when the second set of spawns did indeed posess Kaly's lute.<br><br>Since we were in MIstmoore, I asked Tulbil if he had any cooks on track from which I could get cauldrons off of for the Armor of Ro.  He said there were cooks on track and that he was going to pull them.  He disappeared down the hall for some time and began to get attacked.  He was mezzed and losing hitpoints so we all headed thru the doors he went thru to see if we could help.  This is where things got a little hairy. <br><br>Arriving outside the dining room, we saw a group of 10 or more monsters attacking Tulbil.  Another hectic battle ensued but the only real danger was to Gaiele's pet who had to be healed with a Lay of Hands by Joaquin.  Unfortunately I dont think we made it to the cooks and since it was getting late, we decided to call it an evening.<br><br>We fought our way back out of the castle quite easily and went our separate ways quite richer and more experienced in the process.  I know I couldnt have gotten the hilt by myself at my level and can only thank Gaiele, Tulbil, Joaquin, Kaly and Brogain for all of their assistance.  With a group like that, I look forward to another adventure within Mistmoore to cleanse the world of Norrath of the vile evil known as Mayong Mistmoore.<br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

Echo Caverns is an area adjacent to Shadow Haven and is comprised of a lower level &quot;mutant&quot; and &quot;needelite&quot;   area and a higher level Task Master and Underbulk area.  I came here with Miauu a couple months ago and found the area quite a challenge with decent loot and very good experience when you factor in the dungeon bonus.<br><br>Sinyee, Hpotter, Swift and Diiana decided to stick to Iceclad Ocean in the hopes of finishing a couple of quests while Brogain, Kaly and I headed on to Echo Caverns.  The first spot we grabbed was the underbulk room adjacent to the The Deep which had an area with Fiends, Underbulks and Stonegrabbers which were static monsters.  One of the nice things about EC was that the monsters didnt move much and there were many areas to set up camp away from wandering monsters.  Because we had no fear of adds, it was a nice change from Guk where that was a constant fear.<br><br>I have no idea how long we stayed here but the normal monsters were easily dispatched by the three of us.  I have really come to respect the ability of Paladins and Clerics to pull single mobs using the Pacify line of spells which made it all the more safer.  Loot off the normal mobs was so-so with a couple PP per person usual loot from the stonegrabbers and various items which sold for 5 or 6 PP which fell off the fiends and the underbulks.  One item which seemed particularly nice was the spores from the fiends which seemed to grant a +2 STR, +2 STA and -2 CHA benefit to anyone holding it as loot.  It seemed strange because this effect was noticable without equipping the item.   Maybe its a bug?  Regardless, it was nice for a melee type.<br><br>We also fought a couple of notable monster types.  Fireclaw is a giant underbulk, a type of insect creature which looked like a cross between a pill bug and a horseshoe crab which had quite a few HPs and a nasty ability to damage you with a direct damage spell.  With the superior heals from Brogain and the combat spells from Kaly, we dispatched him multiple times throughout the evening and all looted a Fireclaw carapace which is a halfway decent cloak item which grants protections against magic and fire.  We also found his more rara drop, the Fireclaw which is a decent weapon usable only by beastmasters which procs that same DD spell that fireclaw hit us with.<br><br>The other notable monster in there was Trilcor a named fiend who had quite a few hitpoints and a nasty ability to stun/spin melee'ers attacking him.   Seemed I was the one who usually got hit with that and we all had a good laugh over that as Kaly and Brog watched me pirouete in place.  Despite the difficulty in dispatching him, he had no notable drops.<br><br>Later in the evening we decided to head down into the Taskmaster room where the Taskmaster resides with his 6 undead slaves in addition to the regular monsters in the area.  Figureing that the Taskmaster was a form of undead, we thought that since Paly's and Clerics were undead specialists, we could handle this room.  We were so right.<br><br>We met up with another paladin there who joined the group and began pulling the taskmaster room.  Between two paladins procing with ghoulbane and Instrument of Nife and Brogains Expel Undead spells, all of the undead including the Taskmaster went down quite easily.  The last time we cleared that room we noticed a new monster in the taskmaster room.   It was a snakelike creature with a head of snakes named Xilnov.  I told the group that he often spawns after the TM room is completely cleared and that he is NOT to be trifled with.  We decided that discretion was the better part of valor and left him be :)<br><br>The loot in the taskmaster room leaves the rest of the zone to shame.  Each of the undead slaves drops a pickaxe which can be sold at the local zone vendor for  a little over 7PP a piece so we left with a very nice chunk of change for a days effort in Echo Caverns.<br><br>We returned again last night and immediately claimed the taskmaster room as ours after finding it empty.  The biggest surprise of the nite was Brogain's fit at not finding the Yadra-KEI 'bot available in the Nexus and had to settle for a second rate KEI from someone else. <br><br>While Brogain was looking for his KEI-fix, we joined forces with an Iksar monk who was a great addition to the team.  With his damage dealing abilities, the monsters we faced stood no chance.<br><br>This zone is going to be good for quite a few levels yet.  We all have dinged at least one level in the last day and Brogain is only a couple blue from 42.  I cant wait to reach that level 40 mark since I consider the 40s a significantly higher level than the 30s.  Theres just something about the &quot;4&quot; which makes me drool :)<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Apr  1 10:02:48 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

As we age, we learn from our experiences (at least we're supposed to) and take action in the future that will not put us in harms way. At least thats the way is supposed to work.<br><br><br>Im no longer a teenager and should have a good solid base of experience from which to choose the safest actions for myself.  I've played EQ for years and have raised Baelnorm to a very respectable level with a minimum of twinking.  I know how dangerous Guk can be having spent a couple days in there killing the live frogs up top with a different character.  Even then, I died a couple times from some of the deadly trains which can result from combat.  I disregarded my past experience and Sinyees advice, the most notable which was &quot;I've seen 2 groups of 50 get wiped out here&quot; and pursuaded the group that we'll be fine.  After all, it couldnt happen to us, we're immortal.<br><br>Diiana, HPotter, Brogain, Kalyaris and myself headed into Lower Guk to do a bit more exporing and possibly to find some mask which drops off the ghoul assasin.  The biggest problem we had to deal with was the faction of Sinyee and Kalyaris.  Froggies hate necromancers (after all, who doesnt) and stared at Sinyee ready to attack.  Kaly the bard, supprisingly, was also KOS to the live frogs.  In her early years, she was grouped with players who decided to kill the live ones wontonly.  As such, her faction was ruined.<br><br>We decided to make our way down to the dead level.  In my past, Ive fought all over the top side but never a group brave or worthy enough to head downstairs.  This was a chance I was looking forward to.  Kaly sung her invisibility song and Diiana invis'd Sinyee and off we went.  We make our way deep into the upper region and somehow the froggies saw thru Sinyees invisibility.  Brogain trys to heal, froggies dont like that, froggies train.  I cant remember if anyone died here since we died so many times...I have lost count.<br><br>Next HP follows me into the zone and goes swimming off blindly and stumbles into a ghoul Wizard.  Two casts later, HP is dead and upon resurrection, decides to go elsewhere.  In hindsight, probably a smart move.<br><br>A bit later, Diiana buys the farm and decides to leave.  I feel real bad for her since she is now reconsidering groups in favor solo'ing.  She HAS died quite a bit recently which I feel quite bad about but I can assure her that I trust her completely and would put my life on the line to protect her.  I actually used my LoH on her twice yesterday during some of the bad situations which developed.<br><br>Down to Sinyee, Brogain, Kaly and myself and I retreive the corpses, rez Brogain with my measly 20% rez who then rezzes me and Kaly.  We run into more live froggie problems when Sinyee agros them and we get separated.  I finally round everyone up, proceed into the bedroom in the dead area and pull a bit into this area safely.<br><br>We're doing well finally.  I have Ghoulbane up with Instrument of Nife and with Kaly's speed song, find myself proc'ing 3 or 4 times against each undead monster we have to fight.  They arent resisting Soothe either so we can pull in small manageable numbers.  I then revert to a teenager and with some pursuading from Brogain, decide to venture into the bridge close to the assassin and pull the wizards.<br><br>The first two are a piece of cake.  Once we learned to stun them when they began to cast, they never were able to get a spell off and with a few wacks of Ghoulbane, went down like a cheap 'Ho in Saigon.  The third one was a ways back and as I was maneuvering into position to pull him, I fell off the bridge and into the waiting arms of a couple of ghoul knights.  I calmly tell the team not to interferre and that Im going to &quot;take it for the team&quot; and die down there so I didnt cause an ugly train where we ALL died.<br><br>Brogain would not have any of it and stood above me and convinced me that I wouldnt die so I began swinging at the ghouls.  My life is dropping quick so he heals me and ends up agroing 4 which subsequently kill him.  They are then back on me and I die too.<br><br>This is where the story of Shorten, one of the high ranking clerics of the Knights of Marr (one of my guildmates) comes in.  Kaly asks the guild if there are any clerics that can help minimize the experience loss with high level rezzes and Shorten graciously offers his services.  <br><br>Any normal person who's died twice in the span of an hour would stop whatever it was they were doing but not us.  I wanted vengeance and was sure there had to be a way to succeed here.  Brogain felt the exact same way as I and I have really come to respect him as a fellow adventurer.  We are so alike from the joy of exploring to the sacrificing of oneself to save another that its a real pleasure to be around him.  Kaly (his RL girlfriend) didnt want to abandon us and Sinyee who has even more experience with EQ than most of us, was just laughing at the situation.  Where most would get upset or frustrated and leave, Sinyee stuck with us for whatever reason....probably amusement above all else.<br><br>Anyways, Shorten rezzes us all in the bedroom and decides to take us to the room where the &quot;ass master&quot; (assassin) is located.  We Invis to Undead and head past where I died last to a room with a couple ghoul knights.  We begin working on those knights and somehow agro a HUGE train.  It got so bad that Shorten yells to the group to run which we try.  All of us have been stuck with some sort of a snare and die quickly.  Shorten rezzes us AGAIN and this time, we decide to leave rather than risk any more deaths.<br><br>In summary, Guk was a complete and utter fiasco.  I like a challenge but without a group who knows that place inside out and can handle finding the way to the multiple zones by themselves, it is not a place for the unwary to go.  Thanks to Shorten who saved us quite a large loss of experience and I think most of us left with about the same amount of experience as we entered with.<br><br>Im so close to 40 now I can taste it and it may be time for at least a few sessions of safe killing.  The Snow Cougers in IO are a great source of experience and can be killed quite easily so I may spend some time there.  I cant exactly rule out not going back to Guk at some other point but until I find a group who knows it better than I, I will stick to other zones :)<br><br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>38th Level Paladin<br>Knights of Marr<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Mar 30 09:48:50 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

We decided to organize another assault on the orc mines and decided to rally the troops at the RyGorr fort in the Eastern Wastes.  The group would consist of myself, HPotter, Swiftarrow, Sinyee, Diiana, Kalyaris and Brogain the smart ass cleric :)<br><br>Ive always wondered how in the world greed and selfishness defines a persons character in the real world and how those same persons are defined by those same characteristics in a game like EQ which encourages cooperation above all else.  It was nowhere more evident than at the fort lastnight while we waited for everyone to arrive.<br><br>HP, Swift, Sinyee and myself had formed a group and were pulling RyGorr centurians and Legonairres and were in the middle of a fite when a level 50 ShadowKnight runs up and says, &quot;Piss off!  We're camping the RyGorr fort.&quot;<br><br>He then went on and shouted &quot;n00bie guild&quot; and went back to his group.  I understand that camping specific mobs is a necessary part of the game but nothing pisses me off more than high level groups thinking they can camp an ENTIRE area.  Add this to the fact that he disparaged the name of the guild which I have become so close with and I was fuming.  A number of tells went back and forth between the more cool-headed Sinyee and this &quot;gentlemen&quot; and we decided we would leave the Orc Chief to his group.  <br><br>The truth of the matter was that we were even goin near that guy anyway since he would mop the floor with us.  At our levels, we can barely manage a single Elite Guard much less 2 of them and the Chief.  Fortunately, Sinyee was able to calm this guy a bit and actually coax an apology from him.  The icing on the cake, however, was watching this guy's group (all low-mid 40s) get completely waxed by the chief and his cronies.  I believe we added insult to injury when we offered to rez the entire group :) LOL  It was then at this point that some of his group mates apologized for their compadres attitude and comments.<br><br>We soon had all 7 of us at the rally spot and decided to form a raid group so everyone would get experience from the kills.  It took a bit to understand how the raid works and a bit longer to get it set up so everyone could loot but we finally managed to form 2 groups...one melee group consisting of Swift, Brogain and myself and a second caster group consisting of Sinyee, Diiana, Hpotter and Kaly.<br><br>We discussed how we wanted to get to the hunting area at the bottom of the pit and decided that some exploration would be fun and decided to work our way down the winding passageways.  <br><br>We all zone into Crystal Caverns and begin our journey downwards into the depths of the mines.  We round a corner and find the much valued Herbalist cowering in the corner in the face of such might.  We easily dispatch him and find him carrying a Blackened Crystalline Robe which we gave to Sinyee.  <br><br>We fought a few more and moved further down and upon reaching the bottom found the Inspector watching over his miners and dispatched him too.  On him we looted a Crystalline Belt which was also distributed to the most needy in the group.<br><br>We continued fighting down here for an hour or so and decided to explore the Coldain town a bit.  We headed eastward and after some selling and banking in the Coldain town, found another exit from the town heading eastward away from the orcs and decided to follow it.  This passageway opened up into a large frozen chamber with a broken bridge populated with tentacled beasts known as Tentacle Terrors all of which were easily dispatched. We went further in and ran into a druid and ranger sitting in an area filled with a group of 3 terrors which decided to attack us.  This ranger and druid had previously declared they were camping the terrors and after waiting a bit for them to take these terrors off us decided to just kill them when they made no effort to do so.  No hard feelings were made since we told them we were just exploring and that they agro'd us so we moved back out and were going to scout out the spider area when we found it too was camped with a mid-50s level character who was obviously farming it.  Its a shame when such high level characters feel the need to deny lower level characters who can actually make experience killing these monsters but such is the life in Everquest. :/<br><br>It was getting late so we decided to make our way back out of the Caverns.  We found our way back to the orc area and while clearing the lower level, we managed to deal with a pretty large train of about 8 or 9 orcs led by the Foreman and a couple of watchmen.  Our expected great teamwork quickly dealt with the threat and we medded back up in preparation for our exit.  This battle also turned out some decent loot as we found the Foreman's Skullcap.<br><br>We make our way up the passageway to the southwest which then turns left and heads upwards towards the pit.  I ask the group to hang back a bit while I Soothe each of the mobs to avoid another big train but in the process Kaly falls off the ice bridge across the pit and manages to stir up a pretty big train.  Everyone except Kaly is now on the bridge and fighting quite a few orcs up top while kaly is telling us of all the orcs down below her and on her.  During the fite up top, I had to use my Lay on Hands with Brogain to keep him from falling and after killing these orcs, raced back downwards since Kaly was now being attacked.  Unfortunately, we were unable to save Kaly before she died :( but having a cleric in the group quickly brought her back to life.<br><br>We healed and medded up once again and once again set out on our trek upwards which this time was uneventful since we now knew what to expect.  We fought quite a few Oracles on the way upwards but none of them held the vaunted Cloak of the RyGorr Oracles which we had been hoping for.<br><br>We left the Crystal Caverns and decided to call it a night soon thereafter claiming it a very good raid all things considered since a few of us dinged levels and we came out of there with three decent items for various group members.  <br><br>Another good night for the Knights of Marr!<br><br>-Bael</p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

I had run this trip numerous times and since it was day was fairly confident the Dragoon guards had yet to begin their nightly patrol of the area and that I should make it to the book with a minimum of problems.  That confidence was soon broken as I see a figure come running out of the city gates with a Dragoon on their tail so I high tailed it from that point on towards the book.  Just as I became satisfied that I had successfully outrun the 'goons, I am wracked with pain as two guards begin carving up my innards with their steel.  Im nearing the book and hope that I can make it before I die but even the soothing balm of my own Lay Of Hands cannot keep me from leaving this earthly realm.  I find myself back in PoK and hope that I might find one of my cleric guildmates available to do a quick rez so that I minimize the loss of experience.  Heelyou, one of the many clerics we have in the guild, was quite helpful and answered the call.  He took time away from his adventuring day and rezzed my corpse and even sent a few useful buffs my way.  This is one of the things I love about our Knights of Marr Guild.  People like Heelyou, Lokey, Aznar and many others will go quite out of their way to help others in need.  I try to do the same to those who might benefit from my skills as well so that I too can uphold the tradition of being known as one of the more altruistic guilds on the server.<br><br>I quickly port back to PoK and begin looking for group members but it was still early and none of the regulars are on yet.  There was however quite a few of the Europeans on and I was greeted by Miauu, the Danish pussycat, who has rocketed up in experience due to his inhuman ability to play for 48 hours at a time.  I also soon saw Baedil, the English ranger, who I've grouped with many times as Pjrell but who I had yet to group with as Baelnorm.<br><br>Baedil sends his greetings to the guild and asks if anyone needs a 39th level ranger.  Baedil and I decide to start forming a group and head out to the Great Divide to hunt some dire wolves while we wait for others to join up.  The first dire wolf isnt too bad as Baedil, obviously more proficient at the sword than I, and I easily dispatch it.  The second one becomes a bit more of a problem as we attract the attention of a wandering giant and are forced to flee back to the Plane of Knowledge.  We zone back and decide its best to hunt here with a larger group :)<br><br>Its about this time that everyone begins to join the day.  HPotter, Sinyee and Diiana join the group a bit thereafter and we let Baedil know that we are a &quot;silent&quot; group...meaning that we dont do a whole lot of typing in group chat.  The reason for this is that we have all found Roger Wilco (a voice chat program that works with EQ) is vastly superior to typing into group chat.  For me at least, hearing another voice on the other end of the line reminds me that there are living, breathing people behind each of their online avatars and as such, during stressful or exciting encounters its very easy to detect that excitement in your groupmates voices.  Roger Wilco has also saved our butts more than once since it is quite a bit easier and faster to tell your groupmates of adds or other problems thru voice than it is to take time away from what you are doing to type something into the buffer.  My favorite reason for using RW however is more personal in nature since I consider everyone on that channel a close friend whether Ive known them for 2 years like I have a couple people or whether I met them yesterday.  RW just brings us that much closer.<br><br>As posted in previous journal entries, I have been bitten by the adventuring bug as of late and wanted to do something a little bit different than the experience grind in The Overthere.  The five of us, Sinyee, Baedil, Diiana, HPotter and myself begin discussing places to go and quickly decide upon the  Ry'Gorr fort in the Eastern Wastes.  We head out there and begin levying wanton destruction upon the hapless orcs there and find that even the dangerous RyGorr Orc Chief doesnt stand a chance against us.  <br><br>We decided that we would see what kind of drops we might find as loot to take back with us and began hoping for some of those valued Rg'Gorr armor pieces.  Although we didnt find any of that armor, we did happen to loot quite a few Orc Fang earring, Crystalline eyes, Orc Fang necklaces and velium weapons to distribute throughout the group.<br><br>I told the group about some of the fantastic treasures to be found in the Crystal Caverns accessible from a portal stone just inside the orc fort and we made up our minds to head down to the bottom where we might be able to find the Cloak of the RyGorr ORacle or Herbalist Packs from some of the monsters down there.  After having Diiana and HPotter invis and levitate the group, we head into the fort and zone into the Crystal Caverns.<br><br>We make our way down to the bottom of the pit using levitate and are immediately greeted by the RyGorr Herbalist who is quickly dispatched.  We find one of the valued Herbalist packs which has 6 slots and a 20% weight reduction and set up camp in the hallway between the Foreman and the Coldain town.  I begin pulling everything I can find and we have little trouble dispatching whatever comes our way.  <br><br>A couple hours later and quite a few platinum richer, we decide the best way to learn the layout for future ventures would be to work our way back out.  Unfortunately the zone is so complex that even with a map, the way out is difficult to follow.  Add the fact that only Baedil and I had been here before and knew little of the way back out and it would soon show to be quite an adventure to find our way back out.<br><br>I study the map carefully and ask Diiana to invis me so that I could scout a bit while the others med to full for our journey out.  I find the pit itself and figure that the way in has to be the way out.  I go back to the group and we fight our way into the pit and climb the ice ridges that ring the ledge.  We fight our way to the Ice Bridge guarded by two orcs and head through only to find thats a dead end.<br><br>We head back down to the bottom of the pit looking for an alternate exit and find that our group has attracted quite a bit of attention from a number of Orcs.  Diiana mezzes as many as she could but the sheer number of enemy forces us to choose retreat as the better part of discretion and run to the Coldain city and the waiting protection of the guards.  We arrive at the city without loss of life and begin asking others in the area for help getting back out.  <br><br>Unfortunately, the exits they are telling us about are referring to areas where we have never been nor did we know how to get to so we were back to square one.  As I studied the maps, I saw one route we had been to but which looked like it was a dead end and decided to try it once more.  It led upwards to an ice ledge overlooking the pit but which on the map showed a ledge which went around the wall of the pit.  As we made our way back there, what had looked like a dead end actually did show a ledge encircling the pit which is only visible if you move to the right side of the rock outcropping.  We made our way around and saw about 5 orcs at various locations on that ridge which could be trouble if engaged all at once.  To avoid the number of orcs we would have to deal with at one time, I soothed each one of them so that we would limit the number of orcs engaged.  This proved to be quite easy and in the process we found a Cloak of the RyGorr Oracle on one of the Oracles.  We let Diiana have this one and told HPotter we would get him one soon enough.  Unfortunately for our shammy, none dropped the rest of the evening.<br><br>Once around the ledge and across the bridge, we followed a number of other tunnels upward and were soon greeted by the warming rays of sunlight back in the orc fort.  We made our way invisibly back outside and waved goodbye to Baedil who had to call it an evening.  We probably spent a good 2 or 3 hours down in the pit and had little trouble dealing with orcs while we were down there with exception of that one time as we were trying to leave it.  We decided then and there that Crystal Caverns was due for another visit sometime soon!<br><br>The rest of the evening was spent with two other Knights of Marr disciples, Brogain the cleric and Kaly the bard.  The first orc we faced was one of the chief's Elite Guards which were easily dealt with previously which turned out NOT to be the case this time.  It was at this point we realized just how valuable Baedil had been with his 3 extra levels of training over any of us.  Fortunately, we made it out without major problems and continued our assault on the orcs within.<br><br>Our major mistake of the evening was soon to come.  As I went into the compound to draw some of the orcs out, I saw a monk running out with an Elite Guard on his tail suddenly feign death right at the gates to the fort.  The elite who was chasing him just stood over him watching the fake corpse for any signs of life.  Being the honorable Knight of Marr that I am, I pulled the Elite guard off of him with a Cease, dispatched it with the help of the group and Brogain and I healed the monk back to full health.  <br><br>As I went back in, I was hit by some type of ice spell which knocked away a good chunk of my health.  As I stood around looking for the source of the spell, I was hit by two more and decided my best course of action was to run back to the group waiting outside.  Brogain healed me back and I told the group I had no idea where that had come from as there were no mystics or oracles in sight.<br><br>As I was heading back in to find the source of our troubles, I ran into 2 elite, the chief and a centurian who must have initially been agro'd by the monk who then added us to their hate list when we healed that monk.  My proximity to them in the fort must have drawn them out and we were suddenly beset by 3 of the toughest orcs in the fort.  We tried the best we could against these foes but quickly saw Brogain and Diiana fall under the heavy blows of the enemy.  The order to run was given and the remaining survivors tried to flee the area.  Sinyee survived only through the ability to feign death and I only survived because the mobs had agrod Brogain, HPOtter and Diiana as they frantically healed and tried to mez the mobs to get it under control.<br><br>I fled as quickly as I could not even looking back and soon saw the damage inflicted on the group.  It was almost a total party wipeout and only Sinyee and myself survived.  After a bit, the party was reorganized, rezzed and healed and we went through the rest of the evening without incident. <br><br>One of the prized posessions of the evening went to Kaly, our bard, who looted an Orc Stringed Lute which granted a Dex and Sta bonus to her as well as Orc Fang earrings and Necklaces distributed throughout the group.<br><br>Soon thereafter we called it a night richer and much more experienced.  I look forward to the mid-level raid planned for tonight and will suggest we head back down into the Crystal Caverns to further explore the riches that lie therein.<br><br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>35th Level Paladin</p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

The tedium of pulling individual mobs killing them and then repeating just was getting to me.  My adventuring-spirit just got the best of me and I had to move...be free!  I was SURE there were other spots mid-30s could hunt and wanted to see more of Everquest.  I've been here since EQ went live and Ive seen just the tiniest fraction of the zones.<br><br>After spotting Sin and HP online, I asked what everyone was doing.  Sin and HP were working on HP's cleric alt (why a shammie would want to try a cleric is beyond me...it would seem they play very similarly) and I had just arrived in PoK from the Overthere.  I happened to bump into Diiana in the PoK as well and we formed up when HP asked me when we were going to finish the parts of his Totemic Armor quest we had started.<br><br>For those of you unfamiliar with some of the Shaman quest armors, the Totemic armor quest allows mid-20's Shaman to begin questing for a very cool-looking plate armor useable only by Shammies.  Pjrell did this quest in his youth as well and had just about a complete set of Totemic sans breastplate and helm which both require the drops from ultra-rare mobs.<br><br>HP had started this quest about 10 levels ago and for one reason or another just never got around to completing it.  The fact of the matter was that he had just about everything he needed except for centaur charger hoof chips for the arms and legs.  He had already spent abotu 310PP for the two Dufrenite that were needed and so it would be a waste to let those two gems go to waste.<br><br>We all decided to meet in The Nexus to take the scion portal to Antonica which would place us just right at the bridge leading to S Karana which is where we would find the hoof chips.  This is where we lost Diiana for the evening due to connection problems.<br><br>We head into S Karana in search of chargers and while over there head into Splitpaw briefly to see how the change in ownership of that place has affected the difficulty in killing of those mobs has changed since I was here last in 1999.  Back then I used to come here with a full group of old friends and completely own the place.   I remember getting to the point back then where the majority of mobs were green to my 22nd level bard and the only thing that would give experience were the named Gnolls.  Now, it seems they are a bit more tough :)<br><br>First couple gnolls we met were a mix of dark blue and light blue and although they did hit pretty hard, we made out ok.  Even got one or two fine steel weapons off them in addition to the Splitpaw hide gloves.  These were given to Sin since he said he could find a good home for them.<br><br>Not wanting to venture any further than the double doors since there were only 3 of us and we were enchanter-less since Diiana had already logged out of disconnect frustrations, we went out and were lucky to find the hoof-chips on the second charger we killed.  Even though there were no faction hits by killing those chargers, I felt dirty after killing such noble man-animals.<br><br>We head into Lake Rathe to finish up HPs quest and swim over to the Ogres who accept regular Dufrenite  gems and then return either ground or powdered dufrenite in exchange.   HP had them convert the whole gems into the powdered and ground forms which were required for the recipes and we were off to the barbarian camp where the final totemic pieces are made.  Halfway across the Lake, we realized we were missing two essential items for the armor...the banded armor which gets changed into the final Totemic pieces!<br><br>We discovered that Sinyee's cleric could make that armor so he offered to log Nalisha in and get those pieces made for HP.  Once Nalisha arrives with the banded pieces, we head to the barbarian camp and make HPs armor.  I have to admit he sure doesnt look like the leather armor wearing n00b that he used to 1 month ago.  Hes finally shaping up to be a cool looking shammie.  God does he look alot like Pjrell &lt;sniff&gt;.<br><br>Its this point where Swift logs on and the four of us decide to hunt in South Ro with the intent of maybe having the ancient cyclops spawn so that we might be able to start outfitting ourselves with some J-Boots.  Swift and Sinyee are there well before HP and I are since the two of us decided to make the run from Lake Rathe to Rathe Mtns to the Feerott to Innothule to S Ro :)  That was a long but uneventful trip.<br><br>The four of us are now grouped in S Ro and Swift is using his tracking skills to check for the ancient cyclops.  Nothing shows for a bit so we go about killing bunches of undead and spiders when Sinyee spots one of the largest spiders I have EVER seen.  We decide to attack and find that its named Terrorantula.  I begin wacking away and BOY does it pack a punch.  It was hitting quite hard and had a nasty poison as well.  It took quite a few heals from HP to keep from passing into the afterlife and finally we found a tactic that worked on it.  Sinyee had it snared and cast some sort of spell on it which REALLY pissed it off so while it was running after him in slo-mo, Swift and I were smacking it from behind.  It eventually fell to our onslaught and swift looted quite a few Terrorantula silk and gargantuan spider leg.  Terrorantula never showed its ugly head the rest of the evening.<br><br>We also dispatched a couple of sand giants as well which yielded some decent money as well as another couple of items such as Essence of Sunlight and Sands of Ro.  I later tried to sell these items in the bazaar and found someone willing to buy the Essence for 100PP a pop (we found and sold 2) but the Sands didnt even sell for 5PP.<br><br>No ancient cyclops showed up during our stay there however and the xps was very slow since the giants are an uncommon spawn.  I'd LOVE a set of jboots for Bael since I really hate how slow us non-SoW'd types run.  Maybe I will return his this weekend.<br><br>-Baelnorm<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Mar 22 08:59:57 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

At the very least, I would find a WR group and get some experience while I waited for that elusive scroll to drop.<br><br>It was about 6:30PM EST and I expected the mines to be camped heavily.  I sent out a message stating that I was looking for a group and got no reply so in I went.  To my surprise, the MR was completely devoid of players hence I drew the ire of the 4 pickclaws that were sitting in the room.  I was only 34th level and although I could probably solo 1 or 2 of these things, 3 was going to be iffy and 4 was completely insane. <br><br>I shouted &quot;train&quot; (not like anyone was there to hear it) and hauled my pally butt out of there to the guards and safety.  After the area was clear, I headed back in a bit more wary of the mobs down there and started looking for others to form a group with.  <br><br>Once back inside, I started single pulling the gobbies using a combination of soothe and cease.  I would soothe the monsters around my intended target  and then pull him from a distance with cease.  This worked pretty well until either the soothe's wore off or additional goblins spawned but I had 3 on me.  As I was trying to decide whether to stay or run to the guards, my battle was joined by a ranger who dove in to take some of the monsters off me.  We joined forces and finished off the last thief.  <br><br>I asked him to be on the lookout for a no-drop item called Amstaffs Scroll and he chuckled and told me to check the thief.  Sure enough, the thief dropped the scroll which I picked up and placed in the bag given to me by Ruathey which also contained the ghouls heart from Unrest, Noblemans hilt from Najena and the Blade of Nobility found in ButcherBlock.<br><br>I combined the items as instructed at which point Ruathey's bag disappeared.  In my hands Ghoulbane appeared in the bags place and the fruits of my labors (and my guildies) were complete.  I had a very special 1 handed sword designed for me/by me against undead.  It wasnt going to replace my Sword of the Morning as my 1HS weapon of choice but would definately find use against any of the undead I might fight in the future.<br><br>My memory of the xps here in HKH was always that it was pretty good so since I didnt have the ability to gate back to PoK or to get to OT where Sin, HP and Swift were fighting, I decided to stay in HKH for a bit and see how the xps was for level 34.  Diiana even decided to head my way so I looked forward to the company.<br><br>The eventually consisted of 2 beastmasters, a pally, a ranger, and enchanter (when Diiana eventually got here) so I started looking for a healer type to help with the group.  We didnt need ALOT of healing since we were so tank heavy the mobs were going down real quick but if one person took all the beatings from a bad pull, it could be really dangerous.<br><br>This is where I met and grouped with the &quot;idiot shaman from hell&quot;.  I'll leave his name out of this journal entry because I dont want to COMPLETELY disparage whatever reputation he has left in HKH much less that server so I'll refer to him as &quot;Clueless&quot;.<br><br>I eagerly invited Clueless into the group and let him know that he was the only healer in the group so he had healing duties.  We have our group positioned in the WR and a warrior pops on top of me, tanks begin hacking away and 2 Frost Rifts later, the mob is dead.   Those Frost Rifts should have been my first clue that something was wrong with Clueless.  The monsters were dying easily enough with the beastlords, pally and ranger beating on it but why a shammie would waste that much mana on a single mob was beyond me.  <br><br>I didnt think too much about it at the time and went to healing our ranger, HippieChick who must have been taunting and hitting like crazy.  Try as I might I couldnt out taunt her and I was doing pretty good damage myself so I considered myself lucky to have such a formidable ranger on my side.  That luck would turn on us in later battles.<br><br>I was able to single pull with the Soothe/Cease combo pretty easily but there were times we got unexpected adds.  Up to this point, I found myself spending way to much mana after battles healing HippieChick and sent a message to Clueless again informing him that he was the primary healer.  No response from him.  <br><br>Up to this point, Clueless ALSO had a nasty habit of breaking the mezzes on the adds that we unexpectedly got so I asked the group to /ASSIST me  since I was doing the pulling.  Everyone except for Clueless seemed to understand this since he continued to break mezzes in subsequent battles.  Additionally, he was neglecting his healing duties, preferring to cast DD and DoTs on these mezzed mobs.  He was really becomming a liability to the group.<br><br>We healed and medded up after the the battle and with about 50% mana on me, I asked for a group mana check.  Everyone responded with a good to go so I went down the hall to check the RR.  I saw one gobbie and tried to soothe it but ended up pulling all three back with me to the WR.  With a chanter mezzing, we could have handled this easily but Clueless kept casting damage spells on the mobs which Diiana had mezzed.  Luck turned on us when another mob showed up in the room we were fighting and started wacking away on HippyChick who's health bar was dropping very quickly.  I quickly typed out  a request to heal Hippie and saw nothing happen.  I had already used my LoH to save Hippie once so it wasnt available and stepped out of combat and started trying to heal her with my spells.  I couldnt keep up with the damage caused to her and she was killed.  My health was now dropping and I was out of mana so I had to step out of combat and hope that the beastlords were able to keep agro off me.  Once I was sure that they could keep it, I stepped back into combat to see our shammie standing in our combat circle poking the gobbies with his spear.  This REALLY irked me since any shammie worth his weight (much less any other healer) would have been on his butt medding trying to salvage a small amount of mana for a well-timed heal spell.<br><br>How we survived without further casualties is a mystery to me so I told the group to head up to the bank to rest without fear of surprise gobbie visits.  I took this time to ask Clueless what the hell he was doing and was absolutely furious that someone died on my watch when it could have easily been avoided.  I asked him why he wasnt healing and he told me he was out of mana.  I then told him that he was wasting mana on his damage spells and hadnt healed the entire time we were down there.  Getting no reply and feeling that he was completely Clueless, I typed in a fit of rage that he was the worst shammie I have ever had the chance to group with and booted him from the group.  I apologized to Hippie and the rest of the group and explained the circumstances for his boot from the group and was relieved to see that I wasnt the only one to feel this way.  Given the dearth of healers in the zone at the time, Diiana and I decided it was better to make the run to The Overthere and group with people we could count on and said our good byes to the group.<br><br>It was at this point that I realized that HP and I had had problems with Clueless in the past.  We had an awesome group going in Paludal Caverns at the second bandit camp and were clicking on all cylinders.  We were in the middle of combat with a bandit when we see Clueless run up to our group followed by about 10 Phlarg Fiends.  These fiends kill Clueless and then engage us.  We manage to eventually deal with all the enemy and heal and med back up without any casualties.<br><br>This same scenario happens two more times with Clueless as the main culprit with the end result of our cleric dying this last time.  At the time I was convinced he was intentionally training us and had the group send a petition to the powers that be.  I begin to tear this guy a new one asking why he was intentionally training us and got a reply that he wasnt, he was just clueless.  I told him that due to his idiocy he got one of our group killed at which point he sent me an apology thinking he was sending it to the person that died.  I told him not to apologize to me but to apologize to the cleric that died.  I then got a long apology written by Clueless which he has sent to me by mistake.  He was even Clueless when it came to apologies sent by /tell's.<br><br>It was a helluva flashback and one would think that by level 29 (which Clueless was), one would have a general idea of what is expected of him.  I have seen 1st level shammies with more knowledge of their roles than he had and how he managed to reach 29 was beyond me.  I would have thought that survival of the fittest would have weeded players like that out by now but it seems that the world of Everquest is not picky on who lives and dies.<br><br>Joining up with the group in The Overthere was a very pleasant experience as the experience came quick and easy and even when we unexpectedly got additional monsters attacking, they were dealth with quickly and efficiently.  I dinged level 35 with the group and was quite thankful to have them as groupmates.  I stayed with them for a few more kills and then decided to log along with Sinyee and Diiana looking forward to the next great group I could be a part of.<br><br>I think its about time to head to some other decent zone to do some adventuring in.  I think everyone is starting to get a little tired of The Overthere and are itching to do a little more exploring.  HPotter still needs to finish off his Totemic leggings and vambrances quest so we might head off to S Karana to get the last piece he needs for those which is a Centaur Charger hoof.<br><br>I'll have to do some reasearch to see which zones might be interesting but Hollowshade Moor holds some promise.<br><br>-Baelnorm<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Mar 20 10:48:48 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>

I had already had a level 39 Shaman and had decided to just create another character from scratch to level alongside HPotter (HP for short).  When HP saw my shammie and all the things he could do, he decided then and there that a shammie was what he wanted to be.  So, he created his shammie and I chose a Paladin tank as a compliment to his shammie healer.<br><br>Started off in Freeport and after talking to some of the people in the pally guild was told of the Truthbringers armor quest.  After researching some of the items I realized that it was well within my newbie capabilities :).   Off I went, newbie sword in hand and began hunting small ore and other sundry items to combine in my &quot;armor kit&quot;.  <br><br>The first week or two was pretty non-descript, consisting of alot of spiderling, wolf, bear and later spider killing.  Piece by piece I put together my Truthbringers armor and finally had the final breastplate to put together.  <br><br>The only problem was that I needed a giant fire beetle carapace and regardless of how many I killed I could not find one on any of the creatures.  It was about this time that I was fortunate enough to meet another friendly paladin, about 10 seasons my elder, who told me to look in some shops and he would keep an eye out for one.   He also graced me with my first &quot;twink&quot; item for this character, a Silvery War Axe which happened to be vastly better (what a surprise) than my newbie sword.  His information paid off as I took a trip out to W Commonlands to visit the inn.  <br><br>Checking the inventory of the innkeeper there, I was overjoyed to find just the carapace I needed and willingly paid about 5PP to purchase the item.  Once I completed the suit of armor, I probably stared at my new duds in 3rd person viewpoint for 5 minutes, admiring the new ensemble.  I felt sorry for HP as he obviously enjoyed the questing too and wondered if there was any newbie armor for shammies.  Unfortunately he would have to wait until his mid-20s when he could start his Totemic armor quest.<br><br>Fast forward about 2-3 weeks and about 10-12 levels.  HP, Swift (another friend who got hooked on EQ) and I were running through BB on our way to Crushbone when I happened upon a large congregation of people sitting near the Dagnars Cauldron zoneline.  I was greeted by a level 51 Ranger named Aznar who just so happened to be one of the officers of the guild.  My curiousity got the better of me and I asked Aznar many questions about his guild, The Knights of Marr.  Was the guild good or evil, did they have a wide variety of levels, what was the guilds mission, etc.   Everything Az told me convinced me that this was going to be a great group of people to be joined with.  Problem was their minimum level requirements for primary characters was 25 and Bael was only 15.  So I decided to join the guild with my shammie as primary.  To wear the guild tag on the alternate characters, I had to be at least level 15 (which I was) so both Pjrell and Baelnorm joined The Knights of Marr on that fateful day.<br><br>Once HP and Swiftarrow saw Bael with the guildtag, envy once again set in and I had to break the news that they had to wait another 10 levels before they could join themselves.  I tried to get them ready for a guild by inviting them to groups with other KoM alts and soon they too were invited into the guild.<br><br>Fast forward now another 18 levels.  HP, Swift and I have been grouping pretty consistently with various KoM members although most consistently with Sinyee the necromancer and Diiana the enchanter.  We have all hunted together for pretty much the last 8 levels.  We've been to LOIO, Frontier Mtns, The Overthere and just recently Unrest, Najena and Highpass Hold Keep and pretty much leveled together.  Its a group I can really count on to come through during tough times.<br><br>Case in point....I decided to do the Ghoulbane quest as a change in pace since The Overthere was really starting to bore me.  It required 4 separate components, a ghouls heart, the blade of nobility, the Noblemans hilt and Amstaffs scroll.  I happened upon the blade by chance when I sent out a tell asking if anyone knew where the crazed goblins were.  They asked if I were a pally and after telling them so, I got a reply saying it was currently sitting in a goblin corpse which I quickly looted.<br><br>The heart turned out to be a completely different experience.  HP, Diiana, Sinyee and I headed out to Unrest to see if we could find the heart.  No one except for myself had ever been here before and I had never been inside the house where the goblins dwelled supposedly harboring this heart.  We cautiously make our way inside and easily deal with 2 undead.  We make our way to the second floor and end up with a major problem.  While making our way to the open area at the back of the house on the second floor, we managed to stir up about 8 monsters including monks, crazed goblins, various skellies and others.   Diiana is mezzing like crazy, Im trying to keep the mobs off all three casters and HPotter is trying to keep Diiana and Sinyee (as well as their pets) from dying.  What made matters worse is that as one would die, another would wander up and join the fite.  <br><br>We finally prevailed beaten, bruised and out of mana and rested a bit before pulling again.  This process including the agros from hell went on for about 3 hours and never did the heart show up.  Dejectedly we headed out of the manor and as pure luck would have it, the last ghoul we fought on our way out happened to have the heart.  <br><br>We then decided to head to Najena to get the hilt.  I've been there a couple times since Kunark, Velious and Luclin came out and usually noticed that it was pretty empty.  Add to that that its a lowbie-dungeoun I told my group that it might be a tad boring.  Regardless, they wanted to go and I really wanted their company so along we went.<br><br>The mission in Najena was to collect the hilt from the &quot;skeletons&quot; which spawn in various spots in the dungeon.  We head in and find it virtually empty.  There was one other paladin in the zone, and he was nt venturing any further than the first set of gates.   I asked if he were hunting the hilt and was told hes been there for 8 hours and hadnt found one yet.  My enthusiasm for Ghoulbane instantly shifted as I bagan to think a more approriate name should have been &quot;Campbane&quot; since I've already spent 3 hours camping Unrest for a single item.<br><br>We spent another hour or two just by the stairs and pond in Najena killing the 3 skellies around that area and never got a drop.  It was late and the group was ready to log so we called it a night.  The three casters just gated back and I camped there in the dungeon determined to get the hilt the next day.<br><br>Ysterday, I eagerly log into EQ and Najena to renew my search and find only one wizard in the zone looking for some focus items.  I move from camp to camp killing the skellies in turn, hoping for the awaited drop only to be let down by lady luck.  I felt like the unlucky gambler betting that the next hand &quot;will be the one&quot; only to see a pair of deuces show up instead.  After another 2 hours of this and again, just about ready to leave, I am attacked by a skeleton which had the hilt on its body.  Three items down, 1 to go.<br><br>Its about this time that Diiana asks me what Im doing and I reply that Im heading to Highkeep for my last quest item.  She asks if I wanted any help and looking forward more to guild companionship than anything else said sure.  I zone into Misty Thicket from PoK and find not only Diiana but HP, Swift, Sinyee and hear that another guildie, Gdaien is going to join us.<br><br>We head to Highkeep to find the pickclaws completely camped.  Being the only paladin in the zone at the time, I ask in /ooc for honors to loot the scroll and everyone says &quot;NP&quot;.  The 6 of us wait up top and help a young group attend to exceptionally bad pop of gobbies and offer all of our buffs to any of those willing.<br><br>Eventually Sinyee and Diiana go outside to kill the orcs for faction while Swift and HP join the WR group for xps.  I meanwhile stay up top watching the young group in front of me and helping out where I can while I waited for that elusive drop.  <br><br>Finally a melee spot opened in the WR which I joined to at least get some xps while I waited for the drop.  I was only a half a blue away from dinging 34 and dinged it rather quickly in such a strong group and logged shortly thereafter yet without the scroll.<br><br>Im still camped in HK and hope to find that scroll tonite.  Hopefully it will be quick so that I dont have spend too much time away from THE GROUP :)<br><br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>now 34th level paladin<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Mar 19 15:55:02 2003</em></p>&nbsp;<br>-Baelnorm ElMarr<br>56th Season Paladin of Marr<br>Knights of Marr <br><br>- Pjrell Champeaux<br>52nd Circle Shaman of the Tribunal</td></td></tr>
