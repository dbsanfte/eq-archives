	   <tr><td colspan=2>During my time at the Aviak village, I heard many stories of the problems gnolls were causing in Lake Rathetear. It seems they set up a village at the mouth of the canyon that led to the lake, making it nearly impossible for anyone to advance to the water. The gnolls swarmed all adventurers who dared to approach their village and the canyon was quickly becoming a boneyard of dwarves, humans, elves and others.<br>Since I felt I had adequately pacified the bird-people, I decided to head for the lake and see if I could solve this problem. I was accompianied on my journey by the female druid Shandel.<br>We arrived at the mouth of the canyon which led from the Karana Plains to Lake Rathetear. We spent several minutes using our magic to prepare ourselves for what lie ahead, then proceeded to the gnoll village.<br>The village was nothing more than a few ramshackle shelters at the mouth of the canyon. I scouted around and saw that the lake was just beyond the village. The gnolls had constructed a dock at the site and a gnoll magic user with a familiar seemed to be waiting for something there. As I finished my trek around the village, I counted no more than half a dozen gnolls and felt confident Shandel and myself could end this threat ... if we could avoid the attention of the caster while we dispatched the rest. Magic is a variable that is just too unpredictable to take lightly.<br>I returned to Shandel and gave her the details of my recon. She agreed with my assessment of the caster. Our plan was to avoid the caster by attacking gnolls one-by-one, with Shandel ready to call upon the power of nature to entangle any extra gnolls who became aware of our presence.<br>As I snuck towards our first intended victim, I heard a splash from the direction of the lake, then a shout, followed quickly by an explosion. I turned to see a halfling sprinting through the camp, with the caster in pursuit. This of course alerted all the other gnolls, who joined the chase.<br>The halfling seemed to have magical speed as he ran past us and out of the canyon. He escaped safely ... leaving seven gnolls to bear down upon Shandel and I.<br>Shandel managed to entangle two of them before the mob reached us. I dove into the pile to prevent them from reaching her, my focus on the caster. As I attacked what I perceived to be the biggest threat, I was shocked to notice that several more of the creatures also had the ability to wield magic. They used their powers to create illness in my body. I felt feverish and poison creeped through my veins.<br>I was unable to keep them all from Shandel, as the gnolls proved to be far more powerful than we had originally estimated. Two snuck past me and assaulted her. She could not stand against their combined might and began to retreat farther into the canyon. I was holding my ground, but the three who remained seemed destined to overpower me at any minute. The situation would only worsen when the other two gnolls freed themselves from their bonds.<br>Suddenly, a burst of swirling colors filled the air and the gnolls dropped their attack to stare at it, mesmerized. I felt my wounds begin to heal. I turned briefly to see a halfling and human, both wielding magic and both ready to assist me in this battle. I saluted them, let out a mighty bellow, and launched myself at the main caster once again. He regained himself long enough to put up slight resistance, but he hit the ground dead before he could cast any more evil spells.<br>The tide had turned. The halfling and I picked off the gnolls one-by-one, while the human kept the attention of the rest with his swirling display. As the last one fell, I turned to thank my new companions once again.<br>The halfling was named Ooomid and wielded the power of nature as did Shandel. The human, Mecha, identified himself as an enchanter. They told me they had seen Shandel retreating through the canyon and assisted her. She had told them of my plight, but her wounds were too grave for her to assist in the battle. However, they assured me that she was safe and would recover soon.<br>I suggested that after a brief rest, we check out the village one more time to ensure that it was empty. Ooomid and I ventured into the camp ... at the exact same time as a gnoll patrol returned. After a few stunned seconds on the side of both groups, we attacked. The gnolls returned the favor and we gave ground in an attempt to lead them back to Mecha, our magical backup. We manuevered the beasts back to our camp, where Mecha and a healed Shandel joined the fray. What could have been a difficult battle turned into a rout.<br>After another short rest, I journeyed back to the gnoll camp one more time. Finding no more evidence of life, I was satisfied that we had, if not eliminated, at least seriously crippled the gnoll force in the area. I made my report to my comrades. Mecha and Ooomid were on their way to another area of the lake and headed off. Shandel decided to join them. I had business to attend to in Qeynos so I went the opposite direction, but not before assuring them I would be willing to fight by their side any day.<br>******<br>The journey to Qeynos on foot is a long one. Much of the trip is along a river called The Serpent. There is not much danger on the banks of this river, despite its somewhat-ominous name. A few bandit camps are the biggest threat for less-experienced adventurers, but I had nothing to fear from the likes of them.<br>The miles began to drag on as I entered what are considered the Western Plains of Karana. I had decided to continue traveling at night rather than rest, but as midnight approached I felt it was time to make camp. Just as I prepared to stop, I spotted a lone figure standing at the bank of The Serpent, staring off into the water. Thinking him another bandit, I decided to scare him off or destroy him. There would be no safe camp here.<br>As I approached though, I noticed that this man's armor gleamed too brightly to be a bandit. He was too clean and well-groomed. In fact, he gave the impression of being a man of nobility.<br>I announced myself so as not to startle the man. He turned to me and beckoned me to approach. He introduced himself as Ryshon Hunsti and said that he was here seeking enlightenment. He asked if I was looking for the same and I replied that I was. He mentioned something vague about a sword then turned back to his vigil over the water.<br>I pressed him for more about this sword. He said it was far more than just a sword. It was a blade crafted by noble men and blessed by the gods. I asked him why he had mentioned this sword to me, and he said he could sense my holy power and knew I would use it for good.<br>Ryshon knew nothing about the current whereabouts of the sword, but he told me of another man who might. He mentioned that a dwarf named Kanthuk Ogrebane was also familiar with the sword. Ryshon gave me a note to present to Kanthuk which would ensure that he would speak with me. I yawned my thanks as fatigue began to set into all my muscles. Ryshon assured me that I could camp there as he would remain up on watch all night. I asked what he was watching for, but he had already turned back to the water and forgotten my presence. I fell into a heavy sleep.<br>When I awoke the next morning, Ryshon was nowhere to be found. I began my journey to Qeynos ... reluctantly. I wanted to sprint for Freeport and a boat that would take me to my homeland and Kanthuk. But I had made a promise to be in Qeynos by the next day, so I continued my journey, mind adrift with thoughts of this sword, &quot;forged by noble men, blessed by the gods.&quot; <br>&nbsp;<br>Gawayne Paendrag - 24th Dwarven Paladin of Brell Serillis - Bristlebane server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Upon crossing the bridge to Southern Karana, I was greeted by a bard of fantastic power. She offered me a strange item - the skull of a cyclops. I asked her why she was presenting this to me. She merely stated that I would need it someday, then bowed and departed. I gathered up the skull, pondered its significance momentarily, then began the trip to the aviak village.<br>Along the way, I discovered what could best be described as a village of skeletons. As I am a holy paladin, I spent some time hacking apart these abominations to Norrath. I gathered up the bone chips that were left to present to my guild when I returned to Kaladim, then continued on.<br>After a long trek across the plains (including some run-ins with strange beasts I was later told were called &quot;elephants&quot;), I arrived at the aviak village. It resembled a series of bird houses, connected by a single ramp that ended at a large main house at least three giants' heights above the ground. As I inspected the structure, I saw a horrible sight. A fellow adventurer slipped from the top level and plummeted to the ground, never to rise again. I said a prayer for her soul, reminded myself to be cautious, then proceeded to the ramp.<br>There I was met by a ranger named Quisnost, who was looking for people to band together in battle against the birds. I agreed to join. The other members were Prymate, a mighty warrior, Athiena, a young but knowledgeable bard, and the magic-users Nelwen and Sanfilar.<br>Prymate and Quisnost headed to the gypsy camp in North Karana to have their souls bound close by. I led the others in several small skirmishes with the birds. The aviaks here were very similar to those of my homeland; they hit hard and can take a beating. I've always respected their fighting strength, and these early battles in Karana served to solidify that respect.<br>When the other warriors returned, we began to battle our way to the top level, or what adventurers refer to as the &quot;penthouse.&quot; We fought the lower-ranking birds, mostly darters and rooks, creatures that any of my party could have defeated on their own, although not without a struggle. A vicious harrier was our first difficult opponent. Our combined might was too much for it, but I knew facing more than one such foe at a time could be our downfall.<br>We carved our way to the penthouse and discovered six low-ranking birds waiting for us. I used some of the spells granted me by my god to Lull and Root the aviaks so that we could fight them in smaller numbers. We dispatched the first batch easily, then sat to recover and wait for more to appear.<br>The trouble began with a lowly darter. He was the first to venture into the room and the first to taste our steel and fire. However, before he fell, another aviak appeared - an avocet, the mightiest of the birds in the village. It was far stronger than any of us and the darter had distracted us enough for the avocet to sneak up and begin its assault.<br>After we killed the darter, we turned our attention to the avocet ... but before that battle even began, a harrier, stronger than the first, appeared and blitzed Quisnost. He and I bore the main brunt of the attack and we were quickly staggered. Someone sounded a retreat as the life was beaten out of us.<br>Rather than run, Quisnost and I urged our companions to fight on. We held our ground and the others quickly returned. Prymate was especially handy in this battle, slicing the foul birds with his magic blade. We focused all our energy on the avocet and soon he began to waver. The powerful bird became the first to run, but we cut him down before he could summon help.<br>Our attention quickly turned to the harrier, who was continuing his assault on Quisnost. I slashed at the feathered warrior, but soon noticed that Quisnost's wounds were critical and that my compatriots were doing far more damage than I. I stepped back from the fray and began to heal my injured comrade. While my powers are still limited, I managed to keep Quisnost standing long enough for the party to get the harrier running. We finished him off, exchanged hearty congratulations on our hard-fought victory, then sat to mend our wounds and meditate.<br>At that time, I pondered something that had bothered me much of the day. Although I initiated most of our battles with the birds, during the fights they routinely turned their backs on me to battle other members of the group, members they viewed as more powerful, more of a threat. I had to admit that despite the fact I was the most seasoned adventurer of the group, I was the weakest link in battle. I could use my battle instincts to give us an advantage, but when it came down to straight melees, I was not needed in this group.<br>We fought several more battles, then I wished my collegues luck and departed. I knew that I needed to acheive more power if I was to be a true holy paladin of Brell Serillis. I had a strange feeling that the cyclops skull I was given was part of that puzzle, part of my journey to obtaining more strength.<br>But my thoughts flickered back to my days as a young paladin and talk in the guild hall. I had often heard stories of &quot;holy swords,&quot; hidden somewhere in Norrath, waiting for a paladin of true strength and virtue to discover and wield it in righteous battle. One in particular I recalled by name.<br>I decided to continue my battles in Southern Karana for a time, but my main focus has become gathering information to begin my quest for a holy sword. I am going to seek Ghoulbane.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Feb&nbsp;&nbsp;3 15:26:48 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gawayne Paendrag - 24th Dwarven Paladin of Brell Serillis - Bristlebane server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I crossed the Ocean of Tears and landed at a place called Freeport. It was a busy place, full of merchants and travelers. Humans were much more common in this land than Faydwer, as were, I was told, ogres, trolls and dark elves. I made a note to myself to travel to their lands in the future.<br>I went into a tavern. I bought some ale and asked the bartender where I could find adventure on this continent. He suggested the plains of Karana. He mentioned that the southern plains were especially dangerous, with cities of gnolls and aviaks.<br>From the very beginning of my career, my guild had put a bounty on the aviaks who roamed Butcherblock. Hearing that my old foes also brought terror to this continent, my destination was clear. I began the long trek to Southern Karana.<br>I passed through the common lands and a place called Kithicor Forest. It was inhabited by undead monstrosities, so I spent some time battling those creatures.<br>I then journeyed to Highhold. As I was leaving that place, I was attacked by a group of gnolls. I had several encounters with gnolls while in Steamfont. I didn't like them. I destroyed the group that assaulted me and then continued on my journey.<br>The run along the shoreline was long and uneventful. The bridge to Southern Karana was a sight for sore eyes. True action was now close at hand.<br>*to be continued*<br>&nbsp;<br>Gawayne Paendrag - 24th Dwarven Paladin of Brell Serillis - Bristlebane server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I was in Firona Vie, nursing my sorrows when the letter arrived. The reason for my distress was that I lost my most loyal and valiant friend, Gwendilynne. A powerful magic user, we met as young adventurers and formed a strong friendship. We journeyed together constantly, often turning down offers to join more powerful groups so that we could stay together.<br>Our adventures led us to Crushbone, Steamfont and finally the Lake of Ill Omen. Perhaps the name should have been a warning. We spent much time in the Lake, battling the hordes of goblins and sarnaks who controlled the area. We earned numerous rewards, made numerous friends. With Gwendilynne's help, I earned much esteem in my guild for victories over the hated goblins.<br>Then the rumors reached us. Gwendilynne heard that someone found a way to reach the moon. I told her that was nonsense, but she was intrigued. She was a true adventurer and even the possibility that she could reach the moon was too much to resist.<br>I urged her to stay. She urged me to go. I told her that there was too much work for me yet in Norrath and I could not. So we parted ways; I stayed to battle the goblins and she went off in search of the moon.<br>Word reached me weeks later. Something horrible had gone wrong in her attempt to reach the moon. The magic needed to make the trip was too powerful to control. She gave her best effort, as she always had, but the strain was too much ... and my friend was lost forever.<br>I spent many weeks drowning my sorrows in drink when, as I said, the letter reached me. It was from another friend, a young warrior named Jehosophat. He and a paladin (his name escapes me, but his courage was great) requested my help. It seems they had been given the task of acquiring the heart of Ambassador D'Vinn and the head of the orc prophet, two of my old foes from Crushbone.<br>This was welcome news. Not only would I have the chance to help a friend, I could gain vengeance on some old foes and take my mind off the loss of my friend.<br>I journeyed for days across the ocean. The time passed slowly and my rage built slowly as I prepared myself for a difficult battle. I was determined to defeat D'Vinn and the prophet this time. They had handed me myriad defeats in the past, but this time I was stronger. My holy powers had grown and I knew they could not stand against me.<br>Setting foot on my home continent for the first time in months, I wept. This is where I had met my friend, Gwendilynne. I recalled the time she had saved me from certain death at the hands of undead abominations in Steamfont. I was battling alone, outnumbered, when a fireball streaked by and destroyed one of my foes. The tide turned, we emerged victorious. I smiled at my comrade, then collapsed at her feet due to my wounds. She stood watch over me until I recovered. She saved me ... and where was I when she needed me? I could have stopped her, but I let her go.<br>I rose and let out a mighty bellow. I swore I would never lose a friend again if it was in my power. I ran off towards Crushbone. I cared not if I lost my own life in the process; Jehosophat would complete his quest safely.<br>I arrived at the entrance to the cave. Jehosophat and the other paladin were already waiting. I'm sure they could sense something was wrong. I used my holy powers to prepare them for the battle and we entered the lair of the orcs.<br>Many orc guards were stationed near the entrance. They refused to attack us; they sensed our power and trembled in fear. My companions were prepared to let them be, but it had been too long since my loss and too long since my last battle. I began slaughtering every orc I laid eyes on. They tried to flee, but they could not escaped my crystallized blade.<br>Countless orcs fell before we reached the castle. We entered the throne room and discovered a group of young adventurers giving their all in combat with the orcs. I used my holy powers to heal their wounds. One, Diavola, returned the favor, using her powers to prepare us for what lay ahead. Everyone exchanged best wishes, then we were off to the tower.<br>As we climbed the steps to the tower, I took the lead, remembering how powerful our foes truly were. As I peered around the corner, I saw the dark elf Ambassador D'Vinn waiting for us. I charged him and the battle was on. My blade carved through his armor, but the evil elf used his shadow powers to sneak behind me and stab me in the back. Enraged at his cowardice, I let out a mighty yaulp and redoubled my efforts. D'Vinn began to stagger. With one final swing, he fell at my feet and expired.<br>While I healed the others, the young paladin carved the heart out of the dark elf and stowed it in a pouch. Half of the quest was complete. We just needed the prophet now.<br>Before he appeared however, we heard a savage growl. I turned to see Emperor Crush himself had arrive. He wanted our blood. He battered me mercilessly before I could gather myself and counterattack. The youngsters injured him severely while I recovered, and then it was my turn. Blood blurring my vision, I bellowed at the leader of the orcs, my sworn enemy. I lunged forth and impaled him on my blade. As I inspected the body, I discovered to my distaste that the fiend was wearing Dwarf-crafted armor. I removed it and donned the armor myself. It was time for that armor to protect the forces of good.<br>As we continued to wait for the prophet, we were startled by the unexpected ... the return of D'Vinn! Some how, he was able to defy death with his evil powers. After another fierce battle, he fell once again. I took his heart this time and prayed to Brell Serillis that his evil was removed from Norrath forever.<br>The prophet appeared shortly thereafter and fell easily. The young paladin severed the head, placed it in his backpack and we departed, quest complete.<br>The orc guards cowered before us as we showed them the head of their prophet. They feared our power, and we gave them reason to. I sent as many as I saw to join their leaders in hell before I left Crushbone.<br>My companions and I journeyed to Kaladim to show our respect for the warriors guild. We presented them with the belts and shoulder pads of our orc foes and they rewarded us with gold and weapons, though we asked for none in return. After that, we retired to an inn to relive our adventure.<br>The next morning, I parted ways with Jehosophat. He had joined a mighty guild hall and was off to join them on more quests. I could not join them, he said, but I made him promise to summon me again if he needed my help. He agreed, we exchanged best wishes, and then he was off.<br>I was lost now. I had no real purpose. One friend dead, the other no longer needed me. I had become accustommed to traveling on my own or with a select few. I felt the best way to acheive my true power was spending time in isolation, one-on-one with my foes, meditating on the teachings of Brell Serillis.<br>However, something had changed with the passing of Gwendilynne. I felt empty without her company. The adventure with Jehosophat emphasized that feeling. I needed to journey with others, to assist them in their goals ... and, just maybe, they could assist me in mine.<br>I decided to depart the shores of Faydwer. Too many strong memories of my time with Gwendilynne. I headed to the port. I planned to journey to Antonica, a land unknown to me, and see what it offered.<br>As I boarded the ship, I took one last look at my homeland. I knew not when I would return, but I knew some day I would. I would return when I had brought honor to my guild, to the Paladins of Brell Serillis.<br>And I promised myself one thing as the ship left the docks: If there truly was a way to reach the moon, I would get there. For my friend.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Feb&nbsp;&nbsp;2 21:02:09 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gawayne Paendrag - 24th Dwarven Paladin of Brell Serillis - Bristlebane server</td></tr>
