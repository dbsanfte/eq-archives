Solitude is a wonderous thing as one meditates along the sea's shore.  Waves lapping endlessly far down below the snow covered cliffs restore a new calmness after intense moments slaying a Frost Giant or Ulthurk Warrior.  The moments are for reflection, composition of self and words.  They are the times when silk is twisted into threads, the threads woven into fabrics and new armor prepared for young mages and wizards and agile young monks.  The breeze that blows across the water and coats my beard in crystals of frost also carries the scent of cooking Frost Giant steaks, gifts of those that help to slay the menace of these frigid lands.  And as the embers begin to settle for the night's darkness, the last sticks of firewood give a strong blaze of light I use to take gold and work it to a piece of jewelry, meticulously attaching the cold gems in hopes of creating something of value.<br><br>The fingers of the hands attempt to control the thoughts of the mind.  Small picks cut soft gold into tiny delicate fingers that become wrapped about the pink facets of a star rose ruby.  Another necklace is formed, a beauty perhaps to be admired or grace the chest of some young lady, but otherwise, yet again, a cheap bauble hardly worth its weight in gold.<br><br>The old man lifted the ornate jewelry towards the heavens and let the beams of Luclin itself give a different life to each rose colored facet.  He held it thus, two hands as though to place the piece about the moon, pausing, remembering.<br><br>Odd life abounds in peculiar plains and mountains on the seemingly beautiful and peaceful org of reflected light.  A beauty that decieves the soul and can quickly lead the unwary to a quick and cruel death.  Even large mushrooms break root and attack those that merely seek to return from a place named Maiden's Eye to the town of merchants known as Shadow Haven.  The hands bring the necklace upon the lap, yet the eyes study the moon far overhead.  Much is there that is not seen from this Norrathian place.<br><br>And freedom abounds.  Several times now the old cleric stood before peers and friends, joining a young warrior with his beautiful monk bride.  Yet others await willing to bind themselves together as one to explore the lands and partake of adventures.  She, too, has accepted a hand in marriage.  The man she has chosen is most certainly the best of rangers, the most knowledgeable of leaders, and man most surely able to take her on adventures few dare travel between.<br><br>Yes, I am free.  Her laughter as she sits beside him.  Her eyes that sparkle without need of flickering firelight.  Her body that molds to his within his encircling arms.  She is happy.  That is all that mattered.<br><br>The sound of yet another group of giants taking over the compound reminds me that there is yet a struggle here to be continued.  Not tonight though.  Tonight is a night to ponder the future.<br><br>I have spoken to the Dain and seems there is something of value in the giant city of Kael Drakkel.  Having once traveled through the winding streets to the Wakening Lands, I remember the excitement and wonder of what lies beyond.  Tales of dragons heard, stories of sirens and drakes listened to with growing excitement, and beyond the yet unseen haze panthers is purported to be a great city of dragons.  Yes I am free now to search for locks of siren's hairs that will make my next shawl.  Yet more sirens await to provide sea shells for yet a greater shawl.<br><br>The old man's body settles yet lower within the matting of tree boughs gathered for his bed.  Sleep comes as goals and adventures speak out his name.  The cold wind yet causes the shawl about his shoulders to dance to its forces and the beating of waves upon the shores.  The wind lifts a page from the tattered book of jewel crafting, as though an invisible spirit beckons the slumberer to make yet another item.  It is unheeded as the cleric dreams of standing before a dragon and conversing with such a grand beast.  More pages turn, the wind howls unnoticed, and the book of jewel crafting slips from bony knee to the embers at his side.  A page, that held promise, darkens, cracks, then bursts into the last great brilliance of the campfire as hungry flames lick and devour the tattered pages and oiled leather bindings.<br><br>The end is just another beginning.</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

Wearily he scanned the icy wastes for a likely camping spot. There! Down by the shore. Keen elven eyes picked up a flare of light, and then another.<br><br>On legs rubbery from exhaustion, he carefully picked his way towards the camp site. As he neared, his caution diminished for he could see but a single figure asleep by a dying fire. He moved stealthily into the camp, scanning for an ambush. <br><br>When it was evident that no attack was forthcoming, Kaellin stopped to consider the owner of the camp. An elderly man, as humans reckoned such things, in the accoutrements of a priest of the Prime Healer - fallen asleep by his own fire.<br><br>Kaellin sighed. Shrugging off his own cloak, he gently laid it over his slumbering host and settled down by the fire to keep watch. He knew full well the dangers that stalked the night - he was one of them after all - but was tired of the bloodshed. He decided that this human would wake to see the dawn, even if the Waywatcher must die to make it so.<br><br>/ooc on<br>w00t. Another striking post!

Again I was asked to aid in foray against a dragon.  Lady Vox.  Though the fear enveloped me and the dread of death lay heavy on my shoulders, I could not stop my adventurous inner flame from growing brighter and eagely accepting the challenge.<br><br>I am sure one could read the 'better' and 'correct' ways to slay a dragon, so I will not speak of the long tense moments waiting and accepting the flurry of buffing magics by friends ot the raid leader.  Instead I am placing in this journal, my tribute to heroism and bravery to ones that face such a magnificent beast as Lady Vox.<br><br>I was assembled in group four.  Around me stood enough excited and eager people to fill over eight full companies of combatants!  Quips and advise bounced about the walls and all was a confusing swirl of activity.  This, my second dragon raid, my first against the Lady Vox, mate to the great red Lord Nagafen who triumphed over us in the last raid, caused my heart to beat wildly and my eyes glitter whether in tremulous fear or brave foolishness, I have yet to determine.<br><br>We were told to advance.  The warrior was to face the Lady alone, save for the three clerics that would continuously cast complete heals six seconds from one cleric to another upon his brave corpse.  That is the picture that yet stays in my mind.<br><br>The warrior was a friend of mine.  I have known him for nigh 30 seasons, though most times I was too young to trail him through his adventures.  I admired his courage then, but never till now felt as I did that moment.  Bolaliel stood there at the stone-blocked entrance.  Garbed in silvery white armor, Reiely ever at his side, he stood alone and fearless.  'Alone?' You ask, 'he had three clerics and a paladin of great stature at his side!  You call him alone?'<br><br>Yes, alone, I repeat.  For others would follow him mere seconds after his entrance into her lair, Bolaliel alone would smite the dragon continuously, forcing her to keep her attention focused on his sharp-edged sword.  At that moment in time, just before rolling the stone to one side, Bolaliel was utterly alone.<br><br>The actual rush as we forged into the lair was a mad house.  Pausing combatants blocked the passage of others trying to enter the lair.  Jostled from side to side, I struggled to enter the lair myself and begin the duties that already called me.<br><br>Giants!  How many I have no idea!  I saw a glimpse of the white dragon, but most of my vision was obscured by three, perhaps four, very perturbed and unwelcoming giants. I heal, and healed, slowly my group began to die somewhere in the ever growing mound of corpses.  I eventually stood as the last of my group, depleted of mana and beset upon by a pair of very determined giants.  I started to run.  Two steps, a small stone, a hammering fist.  Death comes a calling on a cleric.<br><br>The assault failed when surely it was thought impossible to fail.  Either the giants should have been pulled somehow or the message impressed upon all that pausing in the narrow bottle neck of the opening would not allow all to enter the fray.<br><br>One would think that we had learned our lesson.  But the hew and cry became increasingly loud for revenge.  The troops were again assembled and unlike the raid into Nagefen's Lair, our numbers increased!  There were nine full companies and more clamoring to be grouped!<br><br>'Lady Vox, sits shivering in fear all alone.  We have removed her giant friends.' A group leader not part of the assault team announced with a chuckle.<br><br>Apprehensive yet, again I followed my group leader to the forefrount of the assaulting party and again I say the silver-white form of the brave warrior.  Knowing me as he did, he must have remembered all the time I trembled in fear.  He turned and waved, smiling without fear.  'Just cast complete heals on me whenever you can, Lal.'<br><br>I swallowed hard then and made a vow to myself.  This warrior, who was not even in my group, was entrusting his life on my ability to heal.  I vowed then that some day a warrior of the Green Knights would stand at that stone.  I will be behind him, perhaps with Lady Azrielle on one side and Lady Serrienna on the other, ready to take the fight to Lady Vox.  Guildmaster Lord Jeharlondor will have pulled the giants with his party.  Sir Radom will be over the companies of casting wizards.  Lady Enderi and Sir Daughfus Trueheart will command the wave of warriors and such that will follow us into the lair.<br><br>Yet I wonder whose form will stand before me?  Each warrior I feel close to taking that position, great in courage and friendship, moves onward to the lure of greater guilds.  Sir Tankzaar, Sir Oagarbuk, who will be left to stand courageous at the rock?  But my dream will not die.  Someday one Green Knight will stand before that rock.  I shall clap him on his back, give him courage, and follow him with pride into the very home of Lady Vox.</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

I can only hope those interested will find this information.  I have been in KC nearly 24 hours straight, yes in one sitting at the keyboard. (Next quest, of course, is increasing spousal faction.)  The information I present here is what I (emphasize I) found in this adventure and a few previous adventures.  My first of which is posted in this site.  As far as accuracy, I will try to be as accurate as I can be.  As far as mob and loot tables, I'll leave that to the parser readers.<br><br>For you that are first entering KC, note that there are two ways close together to enter this dungeon.  From the Dreadlands zone you have the option of entering in the right or left side.  Please enter the dungeon using the left entrance.  There is a possibility you will live a little longer.  This is also the first of many times you will be told about the left.  Left always zone left, in or out of KC, zone left.  There is only one left.  I do not care how you remember this but left. Left the KC to sell.  Left all alone.  Not the hand with which I eat my food, assuming you are right handed.  LEFT! ZONE LEFT!<br><br>EDIT for clarification: Please when you are in Dreadlands use the left as you look to the KC zone.  From the KC perspective, thus looking in the opposite direction you will be coming into the right side.  As you visualize this from KC perspective the RIGHT side is the side people are coming in or are recovering.  Should you leave the KC zone use the LEFT side, again this is from KC perspective.  The reason this is so vital to understand is that Trains are very frequent and by zoning in the wrong side you may find yourself dead before you can escape.  Also you can lose great player faction should you err and train the players that are trying to recover and rez in the right hall.  You have been warned as best I can explain this.  Always zone using your left, whether in Dreadlands or KC.<br><br>You have entered KC using the LEFT entrance available from Dreadlands and probably see scattered about more than one or two corpses.  If it is a busy day, at the LEFT wall of this area sits many players LEFT naked or LEFT wanting to get into groups.  Following the hallway it turns right and then there is an area called the entrance which goes to your LEFT across bridges and through towers, but if you continue this initial walk straight you will turn and come to the exit that is called LEFT.  Zone out LEFT.  You have LEFT KC.  When you go into KC you will eventually get a train, take the train out the left side.  If you do not take the train to the LEFT exit but take it to the other zone line, most likely you will be LEFT all alone forever!  LEFT.<br><br>As far as classes and levels?  I imagine there are better classes then others, but still there MAY be a time and place for every class.  The ones I see most easily finding groups are Clerics and Enchanters.  Both are nearly absolutely essential for adventuring much past the moat camps.  Warriors, Monks, Shamans could possible be the next easiest to find groups.  Rouges, Paladins, Druids probably fall in about here and the Wizards, Magicians unfortunately seem to find it the hardest to find groups.  Some classes I am simply to unfamiliar with to list such as Necromancers and SK's.  Rangers are useable at times but the eggshell armor allowed to them is a cleric's nightmare, though a Ranger who KNOWS his class, limitations, and abilities can prove invaluable. Though of course there may already be a sufficient quantity of your particular class at any time.  As in all zones some classes can get into groups younger than others.  Will you instantly get in a group, do not count on it, but you should be able to if you are patient.<br><br>The first 'camp' location is the entrance.  With the dungeon empty of all other players this is of course the safest place to camp.  It can be held forever.  Add one other group camping anywhere, even a solid group of 60's would find it a challenge to remain in this camp.  Remember BLACKBURROW?  Psshaw!  That aint nothing!  At the merest mention of train, immediately move away from the camp and plopping your arses done on or near the wall and better closer to the point you entered the castle.  Naturally if you are a high enough group you can bust up some trains, but then obviously you should not be camping this location.<br><br>The entrance camp has a further characteristic of being the beginning of nearly every camp. You want to camp LCY?  YOU WILL most likely start your camp busting at this entrance.<br><br>Camp level 2.  The left moat.  Just past the first two sentries you can turn left or right holding tightly to the wall and set up camps in the corners.  Generally you are safe from any trains, except of course your train.  As an expert at meditation, I chose to plop down as far into the corners as possible.  I cringe every time I see someone else dangle their legs over the edge of land and into the moat.  You will find you can give yourself something to do.  It is the same when your group has decided to do battle at the narrowest pieces of land or standing toe to toe at the water's edge.  Things swim in that water and will happily camp YOU.  But using some common sense this is probably the safest camp to hold for an extended amount of time.  Nearly every class can benefit a four hour camp here.  With knowledgeable healers, you can even do this camp I believe without clerics or enchanters.<br><br>Pull mobs from the water, pull the two sentries, pull from right moat area, pull from the bottom of dog tower, possibly even pull from the bottom of the skel tower.  Assuming no one else is camping any of the areas.  You can pull live dogs from the water and dead things that need to be made more dead.  Dog tower is live dogs and skel tower is dead things.  Will you get awesome loot? No.  You will get experience in a controlled fashion.  You have a possibility of getting some decent things, but that should not be your reason for camping there.  Perhaps most utilized for groups that are waiting for their desired camp to open or by the intelligent younger players learning more about the zone.<br><br>Third camp right moat.  This ranks very close to left moat as desirable for younger players.  However it is sometimes utilized by higher players to begin pulling from the basement.  Since I do NOT pull, I have no warning to give you about what you will find when the puller swims under the water and enters the basement.  One point worth mentioning is the peculiar pathing the basement mobs take when they are pulled.  They land much closer to the corner (where you would camp if you were on the other moat) then you might expect them to.  Please camp directly in the corner if you are not pulling the basement.  If you are pulling the basement settle yourselves with the meditators about 2/3's to 3/4's away from the corner with the melee's between the sitters and the corner.  Allow the mob to climb onto the land and the melees can do their thing while clerics, enchanters, wizards etc can do the things we do behind the fight.<br><br>Fourth camp Dog Tower most commonly called Cappy's, Captains, or a variation of any of the above.  Cross the first bridge and you have entered the tower.  I know there are stairs off to the right and the camps that I have been on have been at the top of those stairs.  This is not a real safe place to learn about this zone but it is the best place to get a feel about this zone.  From my limited exposure to this zone I know of no location that does not have spawn points that aggro where ever you plan on camping.  In other words, though I am not the wisest of the zone, I know no place you can simply sit without something spawning near enough to aggro you.<br><br>The Captain inhabits this occasionally and is probably the first named mob people desire to take on.  His loot is nice, but then so is his amount of hitpoints.  A careful puller can keep the group well occupied.  A cleric is a wise choice to have, though an enchanter can be replaced by a ranger and possibly others that can ghetto park.  I do Know that a ranger keeping his eyes open and casting harmony on wandering mobs is nice.  Particularly if you are just not ready for that third mob to join the fracas.  Here, like in the Dreadlands, aggro control is a premium if you wish to allow your cleric to heal you and not run out of mana.  Please begin now to ask that only one of the group get the aggro and keep it until near death.  These critters hit hard enough that it becomes a Cleric's nightmare watching the aggro make cycles through the members of his party.  Eventually he has to decide who to heal and who will risk death.  All that is negligible if you the melee will control your aggro.  By letting the one meat shield absorb the damage a 45 cleric will find it nearly a breeze to keep everything running smooth.  By using celestial heal and an occasional greater healing all is peachy keen.  Start making your cleric use superior healing on five other players and you will be the next train asked (shouted) TRAIN LEFT.  Exit this camp by going down the stairs and crossing the bridge to the entrance camp and turn left.  I hate to say you need to turn right to actually zone.  But please remember left at the T.<br><br>I have yet to group with a damage caster in KC.  Damage dealt by these mobs can be high.  Get a pair of these Doggies on a nuker and there will not be time enough to save them.  If you enter KC with the intent of blasting the mob, know your class.  Wait to make that Nuke the ending of that dog's life.  If you are impatient and nuke instantly the group should just disband your corpse and leave you LEFT alone.<br><br>This camp is not too difficult for new players entering the castle to meet up with a group in its camp location.  With pullers frequently pulling the downstairs and entrance you can fairly safely get to the group.  Perhaps even your puller has been clearing the floor you are on and bring the lower level up to you using stairs on the other side of the tower.<br><br>A few cautions.  I would recommend you do not fight to close to the wall at the top of the stairs as it is open to allow you to fall off the wall and into the moat or on the ground below.  Nor would I recommend this as the preferred method to escape the tower.  The doggies will still attempt to deal with you and your swimming may not be that great so you could not only have your little train waiting for you on the bridge but have a fresh train on your tail from the water.  For the ones that meditate, sit down on the floor along the wall to the right of the stairs or on the stairs nearer the top, again using the outside wall.  You can almost see the spawn points at these locations and hopefully your melee classes are between you and them.  Since I have not scouted out that floor I do not know if there is a better site to camp the Captain.  Perhaps I will get someone to make me invisible and look for myself.  What I would prefer if it were possible would be to find a camp more in the center of  the tower on the wall over the moat and bridge closest to the Castle proper.  Perhaps there is an area more open to allow greater visibility and thus more warning when doggies begin to pop.  However the top of the stairs is a doable camp location IF you can control the adds you can get.<br><br>Fifth camp skeleton tower.  I have read that this is a camp location, however  I have not heard of it being camped and also obviously I was never involved in a camp there.  I believe the tower to be filled with a collection of dead that needs dying and I am guessing it is slightly more difficult as some of the dead have pets.  Whether there are dead with pets in the tower, I can not factually say.<br><br>The Castle Proper.<br><br>The sixth camp site and the one most chosen for its variety and possible loot is the left court yard.  LCY.  The place to set camp is in the corner diagonally from the structure that is the stairs going up.  You can not see the stairs as the stairs are on the backside and curve around counter clockwise.  You might see the top of the stairs from the LCY but, in truth, I never looked.  Actually I guess I should say that I do not remember seeing them as I have hunted there in a group a couple of times.  I do not remember a spawn directly in that corner, however there are several spawns in the courtyard and they are a mixture of live and dead.<br><br>To get to this camp site start at the entrance camp and begin pulling.  The sentries right there, then the doggies in the lower part of their tower, then begin the extraction of the mob from the chosen courtyard.  When the courtyard is empty or only one or two left that you know your group can handle at one time, then bring your group into the courtyard and into the correct corner.<br><br>Pulling.  I again must advise that I am a cleric, thus seldom ever pull.  However, again assuming nothing else is camped, you can pull from the RCY, the skel tower, the dog tower, and the opening in the wall near where the stairs go up.  You will get a wide variety of creatures.  And if you are not careful you will soon get more than you can handle.  Though I do not know why,  in my camps of LCY no one pulled down the stairs.  I believe that this would be a good place to pull from also.  There is a mob just near the top of those stairs and a lookout is sometimes a short distance beyond that.<br><br>As far as individual mob, the one most likely to need special attention is the Spectral  Curator.  This seems to be a priest class mob that can cast complete heal.  It can also debuff your group, though it is not a group debuff.  Personally when a Curator is pulled I stand and keep it targeted ready to break any casting on his part using the three stuns I have memmed.  I try to use the lowest stun first, then progress up the level of stuns, since he can begin to cast again before the normal stun has become available to reuse.  For the shorter time of casting I simply wait to read that a Spectral Curator begins to cast, when I do not have that spell available because it has not refreshed in time I use the next one up.  Since I use my two highest stuns and the lowest stun, should I feel the Curator is going to cast before the other two have become available for recasting, I begin to cast before he begins to cast by guestimation.   Keeping this fellow from casting makes the cleric&amp;#8217;s need to heal his groupmates much less and shortens the time of the fight considerably.<br><br>Another word of warning.  When you begin to run with your train, please make sure you do have sow.  That is something everyone should have at all times, as far as I can see.  And as you begin to run, be aware the jutting of the wall makes it slightly less obvious where you should turn right and onto the bridge.  Running to the camp the bridge seems very wide.  Running to the zone with a gaggle of dead and live chasing you, you may be very surprised to find you have passed the opening and are now standing in RCY and a fresh supply of mob eagerly wanting you.  Again take your train left at the entrance camp.  Shouting train is nice, even appreciated by all, however it happens so frequently that those at the entrance have already been trained several times and should be ever vigilant of the activity coming across the bridges to them.<br><br>A second word of caution.  LCY is the path of most trains coming from the castle.  You may find every thing is going just fine and suddenly find yourselves surrounded by a half dozen or more irritated mobs.  That is perhaps the greatest drawback to camping LCY.<br><br>Now you could have chosen to camp the RCY.  Unlike LCY this is an open room with a door on one side near the corner, a narrow opening to the moat, and a balcony of sorts on the moat wall.  There is a spawn in every corner, one in the center of the moat wall, and a spawn in the moat wall.  I again do not pull so not sure what exactly is beyond the door, though the puller brings dogs and dead from there.  The construct and the hand, two different entities, that can spawn in the wall need to be pulled out of the wall in order to fight them.  I tried once for a few seconds one time and was not successful, as the room repopped before it came out of the wall.  However to pull it, I saw our puller simply stand there and eventually the hand or construct felt invited to party with us.  Set up your camp in the middle of the wall on your right as you enter.<br><br>Some dos and don&amp;#8217;ts:  Do not fight in the doorway near the way out over the bridges.  Fight only deeper in the courtyard preferably in the middle of the wall where you are camping.  Do keep casters from casting.  Things can gate and things can heal and things can do all manner of unfriendly things.  You read a caster begins to cast, stun.  Stun again.  Do not get all excited in run in a big circle in the room.  The aggro range of the mob will allow a fight right at the wall, but if you venture closer to the center of the room you will bring everything else into the fight.  They may come anyway, but your careless running will invite them much sooner.  Also you will have an enchanter.  Or you should have.  That enchanter will have his hands full simply parking all the critters that want a part of you.  Seems most every dead thing has his pet dog.  Chanters, park everything, pets included.  The rest of the party kill the parked mob in the order the chanter determines.  Please be aware that he might have six or seven things parked all over that room.  Assisting is vital.  Chose one player to be the one to attack and all others assist him.<br><br>Unlike the LCY, RCY is not in the path of all trains.  However all trains will join you should you be foolishly fighting too close to the entrance of the room.  Thus this room is easier to hold for a long time.  However also realize that people miss the way out and can bring in a host of unfriendliness into your camp.  I would chose RCY as perhaps the second best location to bring your inexperienced friends.  It is much less influenced by non-group activity.<br><br>To begin this camp, again start at the entrance and begin pulling until you can enter RCY with few enough mobs to establish yourself.  Also by pulling to the entrance, you are spacing the spawn times in a more comfortable time span.<br><br>The last camp I wish to talk about is the hand room.  Pretty much started like you would start the LCY camp.  Only when your group is assembled in LCY you will now go up the aforementioned circular stairs and the previously mentioned mob. Take the group as a whole up the stairs and kill that first one, and if the other is there take him out also.  When those are finished, you turn slightly right and find yourself in a squarish opening with the moat down there over that short wall.  Do take a few seconds to look about you!  There are several ways to turn, not all that noticeable until you are excitedly running for your life.  One thing to be aware of is that opening you will come to in your flight just before where you need to turn left and find the stairs.  You may not notice it when you came up, but you will notice it when you are running.<br><br>Once you control that square area, the puller will go down the wall aisle.  There is a short set of steps in that aisle.  I believe there is also a door, not that I opened it, but I believe that is where mob sit patiently awaiting for someone to foolishly chose those steps to med or swap spells.  You can walk the aisle and not get aggro, you can sit and have an unfriendly beating on you before you get a spell memmed.  You need to sit and med go back to the square area, or warn the others and let them kill off the two that will aggro through the walls.  However your party should not yet be moving from the square area until the hand room has been pulled.<br><br>The hand room is down that hall/aisle turn to the right at the end, the only way you can turn, then turn to the left at the first opening.  Although this begins to get a little fuzzy here, the hall will take you to a half door and then you are in the hand room.  It is square with a square depression.  Fill it with water and you would have a nice small swimming pool.  Fill it with angry foe and you are in deep doodoo. <br><br>To break this room you should have a monk.  Perhaps an enchanter could mez the hands in the room, but so far my experience has been monks pulling the hands using FD.  The times I have gone to that camp, the hands were singularly or double pulled and quickly dispatched.  Please do not do that exactly.  Pull one hand and kill it, take a minute or two, three even, and then pull the next hand. Once you have pulled three of the four hands and dispatched them, bring the group into the hand room and finish the last hand.<br><br>Unfortunately I do not know the spawn time of the hands.  I do know that each time I have been in that camp with a fast pull and camp, we have had more than we can handle holding the room.  You would be well advised to pull the room slowly and then learn the spawn time before letting the puller do his happy thing.  If you plan on being there, plan on learning the camp first.  It has always been the confusion of hands spawning just as the puller yells incoming and brings in his unfriendly that has caused the camp to collapse in ignominy.  With two clerics and an enchanter the first camp was lost by the puller getting trapped in VS&amp;#8217;s domain.  The last camp with an excellent enchanter of mid 50 or better, failed when a pair of hands spawned as the puller brought in his prize.  Mez failed twice and he was dead before the heal spell finished casting.  Had he not had two hands and an extra pulled mob, I believe we could have held that room all night.  In RCY he was able to keep everything neatly parked.  In the hand room he was the first and admittedly the only one to die.  I believe he would not have died had we pulled the hands and killed them more slowly and separated the spawn times.<br><br>Med on the wall opposite of the door and things should be okay.  The room is small enough there is no safe place to med, but at the far wall you are furthest from the door and nothing aggroed us through that wall.<br><br>As in all things Everquest, if you want some of the good loot from the hands, you will need to camp that area for a long time.  It is a small area that is very active, and when you run screaming to the zone, you might impress a few novices by the train you will be pulling.<br><br>Trains:  When we wanted back into the RCY, it took us better than an hour, maybe two, to re-enter the court yard.  Just about when we had the path cleared, the rumblings of a train was heard and before that train was dealt with, the path was once more spawned.  Since that night there were camps all over the zone, Trains were coming in on top of each other.  Couple that with people not knowing to zone out left, oops LEFT, two or three trains and a host of players battling it out was impressive to say the least.  There was no concern as to whose dog or specter was whose, there was no concern if you healed your group or another person.  I would heal my group first then start searching to cast heals anywhere and everywhere.  We were all too stubborn to simply cede the entrance and simply zone and wait a couple of minutes to let all of KC calm back down.  But is was fun.  I hate to think of the prize loot that was left uncollected and simply rotted.  Even when the battle was over no one seemed interested in looting, perhaps fearful of taking someone else&amp;#8217;s loot.  So hardly anything was looted.<br><br>If you wish some idea of what it is like during a massive raid, come into KC when the basement, warlord room, and hand room all collapse within a few minutes of each other.  You will be surrounded by Ubers in their skivves numbering around thirty or so and a similar number of mob.  Have a fast computer and a good connection, the fireworks have just begun.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jan  8 00:05:56 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

I am alone as I burrow into the bank of snow and try once more to wrap the worn bearskin tight about me.  Alas, though, I find my numbed fingers pulling the cold hard shield, the Aegis of Life.  Surely a wonderous gift, I do acknowledge, with its imbued powers giving me yet more understanding and ability at casting spells.  Yet, it is times like this that I miss the weight, comfort, and simplicity that humble cape provided.  Perhaps in the light of the new dawn I shall find a Blood Dire Wolf and take possession his harness.<br><br>Darkness has decended and even the fire grows dim as the wind continues to rage and the swirling snows makes keeping an alert guard up nigh impossible.  As I have learned I must due, I close my eyes to these simple worries.  Rodcefe Nif shall protect me as he sees fit, it has become that simple.<br><br>Yet I fear to close my eyes.  And I have succeeded for the last several nights by traveling and minor fights with the denizens of Velious that attack a weary traveler.  But tonight my body feels as much numbed by fatigue as by the cold.<br><br>"To keep me warm at night, my hero!"  Her voice was a pleasure, so light and airy that I can still not find the words to describe the sound and how it feels.  Her long lashes lowered as I could not help but stare at her, and her faced warmed with the blush of embarassment.  "Yes, my hero, I collect these kisses and remember them during my time of loniness."<br><br>My heart ached as I yearned to pull her close, yet I know she is far to perfect for one such as I to hold and taint.  So I stood, lost in grief and dispair, as she flittered to yet other heroes and stole her kisses.  So gracious and beautiful, I could find no fault in her.  She was like a butterfly going from flower to flower.  Too beautiful to be captured, too rare and precious to be constrained.  Sure there were those far greater than I that held her for a moment, their laughter ringing out together in mutual jests and teasings.  But always she stole her kiss and lifted freely from the clasping arms to gather yet another kiss from another joyous soul.  I know I can never hold her for I am too jealous.  But I shall ne'er forget the feel of the lips that lightly brushed mine nor the velvetness of her blushing cheek when I dared to touch her face.  Just as she will ever be free, I know I am forever bound to serve her.  I am empty yet I am full, I am content.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

Sometimes, if I think the person selling it needs money and is relatively low level. Why? First of all, there is not a good market for 10-slot bags that are only 10% reducing and weight 3 stones. Why is that? Because I can go to Iceclad safely at nearly any level and purchase a 10 slot toolbox for 9pp that weighs only 3.5 stones and 0% wt. reducing. There then is no reason to expect any but the most foolish of players to pay 100pp, 80pp, or even 20pp, for a bank slot increasing bag. <br><br>How about its wt. reducing and carrying items? First it is only 10% wt. reducing. Should be enough said, but for those that have a few moments more than thinking capacity, evil eye bags are 8-slot 70% reducing and cost 300-350 pp. Herbalist bags are 25% and 6-slot. Many other containers can also be looted far more reducing then 10%. <br><br>Now let's couple some of this with the idea of many items that need to be stored that weigh 0.1 stone. You need the slots but don't even notice any weight reduction at all! And a master looter, porter, whatever, will be greatly encumbered filling a 10-slot bag with FS weapons or Brass Armor, hence will be walking to sell in WC or Highpass Hold Keep long before his slots are filled. <br><br>Recommendations: Carry the much lighter 0.8 stone 6-slot 10% wt. reducing bags until you can get your sewn evileye bag or herbalist pack or other quested, looted wt. reducing container. Use a cheap 10-slot deluxe toolbox or two for your many tiny wt. items and an 8-slot sewing bag for those infrequent giant-size items. Let's math it out if you need help here. 7x3=21 leaving 1 slot for a light source or other item that needs looting. This is filled with 10-slot bags. 4x0.8= 3.2 + 4 (sewing kit) + 2x3.5 = 7(toolboxs) =&gt;3.2+4+7=14.2 saving nearly 7 stones in weight. To make the 10% bags save you 7 stones you would need to carry 70 stones in your toolboxs and sewing kit! You still have 24 slots in the 4 6-slot bags that you could have put all that heavy stuff inside and still have the 10% wt reduction. <br><br>Moral: A fool and his money is soon parted. <br><br>So buy your sewing kit, kill spiderlings, make cords, kill bears and get LQ pelts and save your money. You will be richer in pp, talent, and satisfaction, and still carry more items than you can bear. Can't find any thing but those silly MQ and HQ pelts? Combine with a skinning knife in your sewing kit until LQ. Patiently save your pp to buy the evileye bag, or hehe, get some pleasure from looting your own. <br><br>Would I buy your pelts? Maybe, but not to make money, only to help you as you struggle to play untwinked. I personally know no one dumb enough to waste 100pp for a tailored backpack. Yes they might still exist, but I just do not feel comfortable about ripping other players off. Hehe I get ripped enough to know how it feels.<br><br>Postscript to above:&nbsp;&nbsp;Please save your HQ pelts for yourself.  Keep trying to make them whether you are trivial or not.  When you get one successfully made (always a possibility, though less probable at lower tailoring skills) replace the tool boxs you are carrying with your own 10-slot bags.  Just don't get rapidly encumbered by replacing the 6-slot bags unless you get a lot better than 10% reducing bags.  Even summoned bags of shamans and magicians (?) would be better than the 10-slots, though for obvious reasons risky as they *poof* if you go LD and can't get back on in time or the server crashs thus LOSING everything in them!<br> <br></p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

But also heavy in this decision was the incomprehensible notion that Nagafen is able to protect himself completely from those that are of fifty-three seasons or older.  As his life and death are such an extreme portion of my eventual epic quest, I need ponder the paths I must follow to attain this most potent artifact.  A third aspect of this decision has to do with my own guild.  Of late I have been alone to celebrate my victories and absent to enjoy the victories of my mates.  The Order of Green Knights is a young and small guild where ties are close and feelings run deep between us.  I miss them and go to stand behind them.<br><br>So today I set sail for Butcherblock, thence to Freeport itself.  After the beauty of the elven outpost of Firiona Vie and the far too short huts of the dwarves in Butcherblock, I found Freeport a relief and also a saddness.  It was a heart mixed with these feelings that I set off to the Bazzaare in the Eastern Commons.<br><br>I happened to over hear someone willing to part with a Charred Guardian Shield.  I asked the fellow how much platinum would he be willing to accept and recieved the cost as being four hundred platinum pieces.  Not having been greedy in the looting of the denizens of the castle, I am not a wealthy cleric, so offered him three hundred fifty platinum pieces.  With a laugh he suggested perhaps five hundred platinum pieces.  Obviously my bickering skills need some quick upgrading!  So I was left with the problem of whether to spend over half of my life savings for a shield or go without.<br><br>At that moment I heard a plaintive whisper asking if I would ressurect his/her fallen companion.  Naturally that now took precedence over all else, so as I walked the tunnel between Eastern Commons and Northern Ro, I decided to splurge and buy the shield if he were willing to take my four hundred platinum pieces.  I urged him to be patient and directly after this resurection I would gate to the bank and meet back with him in the tunnel.<br><br>Finding the corpse was pleasantly easy in the drifting sands near the camp the Dervs had erected.  However ressurecting him proved quite challenging!  Asking good Rodcet Nif to bring forth poor creature, all seemed well but nothing happened!  Another attempt failed as did several more attempts!  In a quandary I beseeched the Masters of the Game and was happily surprised by his very promptness!  He bid me cast again, yet that too failed in the attempt!  He then summoned his powers and cast, proclaiming that it worked.  Alas it did not!  He bid me to tell the lost soul to camp and return, again the spell was cast yet too soon the special vision the lost soul got faded too quickly and that too failed, though of course the Master had left for another missive thinking all was once more well.  I offered again my limited abilities and failed.  So bid the sould to camp yet once more and stand poised in utmost vigilance should his vision appear.  Thankfully that seemed to solve this most perplexing riddle.<br><br>I then proceeded to bank and tunnel and purchased the fine shield and was so very grateful that merchant was so patient.  I was pleased to have given him the four hundred, simply because he was so very kind.<br><br>I purchased a port to Northern Karanas and found some guard hiding in the far northeastern corner.  Querying him I found him to less then honorable so, well, er, took his helm and, ah, unfortunately his head was yet within it.<br><br>I swam to the bridge, hoping to rinse the stench of his blood, perhaps in my aged condition forgetting the flesh yet in my pack.  When I happened to enter Southern Karanas I ventured amidst the undead in search of some fellow named Grimroot.  He was, as usual, absent his post, so I settled at the bank of the river and caught fresh fish and attemted to construct fish rolls.  Alas I am such a terrible chef, I have much trouble making a rat sanwich, which even the youngest of bakers learn at youth.<br><br>Running out of worms to bait my hook, I figured to see if Grim-dude was yet about his post.  Instead of Ol'Grim I saw a dwarven cleric from the Forever Exiled guild slaying much undead.  I saw he was having little trouble and seemed not interested in the possible loot of the fallen, so I asked him were he awaiting Grim's return?  He laughed, that trait so enjoyable about dwarves, "Do you think I am here to kill skeletons?"<br><br>Admittedly that had crossed my mind for when I was younger I came at times to try and rid the foul stench of death from the land, though I had much more troubles with success then.  But when he had again slain a beligerant skeleton, he agreed he was wanting to have a special word with Ol' Grim.<br><br>Naturally, I made began preparations to camp and rest.  However just before I closed my eyes, I got the most peculiar question:<br><br>"Are you going to KS me?"<br><br>I was so stunned I froze and could not open my eyes!<br><br>First Sir, I am a Green Knight.  That should tell you the answer to your question.  Honor between mates and others is our highest priority.  I honor your attempts as much or more than I wish to be honored in mine.  I could not think to Kill Steal.<br><br>Second Sir, I am Laleldil.  I must be true to myself above all others.  Were you unfortunately slain in your attempts and I successful to bring the foul to his death.  I would sooner ressurrect you and bid you loot your victory before I would deign touch the corpse you were caming.<br><br>Third Sir, I am sorry you have happened upon such people that you seemed to expect such vile treatment.  I hope someday to be at your side when that happens again.  I will stand beside you.<br><br>I wish you luck Sir and pleasant hunting.<br><br>For others: should you walk with a Green Knight you walk with one that holds honor most dear.</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

I have faced death and lived and I have faced life and died.  I have seen great ones felled and seen young ones trumpting joy of victory.  I?  I am a cleric, sworn to heal for Rodcet Nif, sworn to honorability through the Order of Green Knights.  I have experienced much, yet seem to forever find I have experienced nothing.  Upon my back still rests the tattered remains of my bearskin cloak and I have never yet seen the Planes of any kind, nor laid eyes upon a mighty dragon.<br><br>Yet agian I opened my eyes just within the Castle, where I began to quickly prepare for the day's events to unfold, summoning food and drink as was my want at the start of every day.  No longer surprised, I discovered myself alone except for the terrible creatures of the Castle.  Yet as frequently happens others came into the castle and a small group was beginning to form.  Though not an impressive grouping, we were just beginning to assault the castle and its inhabitants.<br><br>Eerily a voice whispered to me, asking if I would be willing to delve deep within Nagafen's Lair and lay the beast to rest.  Since I had not as yet gotten too deeply involved within the group nor was the group in direct danger with my leaving, I gave notice to the group that I was indeed going to join a raid against the fell dragon.  Attempts to locate a replacement cleric went unsuccessful and it soon became apparent that others in the group were also being invited to join the foray to the depths of the Lair.  Thus, as this young group began to disperse, I was soon ported to Lavastorm's peculiar environs and entered my first experience with a dragon.<br><br>Alas all was not going so well right from the start, since I had died by a great host of creatures pulled from the interiors of the castle.  Even as the mists around me swirled and opened in the port, the ressurection effects and absence of mana was painful to experience.  Seemingly my accompanying group members were deaf to my pleas for patience, because they soon bounded over crevice and rise.  It seemed only the dire warning that my bind point was in Firona Vie gave them slight pause.  Every attempt to sit and concentrate to increase my magikcal potential was interrupt by wandering foes.  Once more near death, I literally begged them to keep the beasts from sending me back to a far away continent, thus seperating me from my scant few belongings.  It was almost with grim humor and unexpected pleasure that I told them when asked to dispell magically the charm upon one of their friends that I had still no mana and thus no way to abet them in thier problem.<br><br>Be that as it may, the group eventually, a few moments, later deigned to appease my whimperings of fear and agony by returning to the druid ring and allowing me the blissful influx of magiks and health.<br><br>Upon my sitting and meditating the events unfolding and about to unfold, more valiant heroes and heroines began to assemble to slay the dragon.  I, admittedly ill prepared in all ways for this adventure, informed those about me, including the Master Leader of my utter lack of experience and knowledge, gathered courage from those about me.  Shocked is a light description of how I felt when I petitioned the very etheral mists of the zone as to the clerics in Lavastorm.  There were but three clerics in the zone, a Vicar of some note, whispering he had yet to experience an assault on Nagafen, and a cleric of forty three seasons.  Though quite unnerved to be, at present the second highest cleric attending such an event, I took what comfort I could as others explained they had partaken many, many times in Nagafen's demise.  As I settled in my bear skin cape (wonder if I will ever set it aside, though I do not feel I will ever set this garment upon another's back) I listened to the reports that an invasion group was nearly complete in the clearing of foes up to the fire giants.  You, unless you are a weak-armed cleric with little skill or experience, will never know the joy that flooded my very being when the petition to the mists revealed that there were now about a half dozen clerics amidst us, one having attained the most senior level of knowledge and carried the lure of every cleric, the epic weapon.<br><br>The rush to the entrance to the Lair, after the groups were formed merely for entry and not the assault on the dragon, was more of a mad scramble and seemed quite chaotic.  Admittedly I have nothing upon which to judge the unfolding events since this was my first such foray into the Lair. My only previous entrance into the Lair was quite by accident while I was searching for the Temple of Ro when questing for my gauntlet.<br><br>Things seemed to run steadily down hill from my zoning into the Lair.  Beset by gnolls (?) at the entrance, though easily defeated with little or no damage, my ignorance blossomed as I soon found myself lost remembering only a lava edge and a room just beyond with a ramp upwards.  I could sense my group mates distress and I tried to heal them, yet they were too far away for my magiks to reach.  My frightened advance and climbing the ramp seemed to bring me no closer, and the sounds of battle diminished.  I raced back down, jumped actually, and closed my eyes and hoped I entered the correct passage before me.  I found the lava edge and a quick turn of the corner gave me the pleasure to find my accompanying group.  Alas I had a Lava Crawler (?) nibbling on my bottom and they were quite busy with some fell spiders.  Though I managed to land a heal on my group leader, all further spells were interuptted and I soon lying in the dirt bleeding from foul wounds as the crawler took his last bite from my carcus.<br><br>So quiet and serene the land of Lavastorm seems after that surprising introduction into the Lair.  Alas my meager possessions resided somewhere within those vile passageways and I was naked at the druid ring.  Further to lay the heart heavy was that I was not alone!  Several of the Dragon Assault party was with me in their less then impressive attire.  However I was not left long to contemplate the situation, ere I was again summoned to my corpse.  Joyfully I looted my now more familiar state and proceeded to contemplate the events as the mana began to fill once more this fragile body.<br><br>As more and more corpses began to be dragged into the area we were in, which was the room with the ramp I had once previously ascended in hopes of finding my group, I kept busy healing the stricken and resting as my own health slowly returned.  Apparantly the area was being hunted by a small group and our sudden arrival of stricken and healthy gave immediate confusion.  With a few Dragon Party members in poor health, we, much to our dismay, felt forced to slay any and all intruding enemies, much to the previous hunters dismay and grief.  Eventually enough were ressurected and healed that we could, with heartfelt apology to the hunters, move our motely group up the ramp and thus towards our upcomming fate.<br><br>Actually I should mention that we were not all that bad an assembly.  Though admittedly I was again unnerved as the leader of my group advanced to a fire giant and died even though I was casting Superior Heal immediately upon his first wound!  He and I were equally stunned.  He apparently believing I was a lax cleric and I have never experienced one of my charges dying in the duration of a superior heal cast!  And if it had landed it was all too apparent that it would have been an exercise in futility!<br><br>Praise Rodcet Nif he learned extremely fast not to have the whole and entire attention of a Fire Giant!<br><br>Otherwise it was quite comforting actually in our advance through the giants.  Even though the pullers frequently were slain, we managed to quickly dispense our justice on the giants even when there came three to interfere with our goal.<br><br>Almost too soon, though my short little dip in lava was terribly frightening, we were all hale and hearty at the entrance to the dragon's lair itself.  There is a peculiar feel when one views for the first time the stone entrance carved into the resemblance of a dragon's mouth open with sharp stalagtites and stalactites for the most foul fangs warning of impending peril.<br><br>Immediately new groups were assembled and orders given to begin the buffing.  Odd and peculiar buffs were cast in all directions!  See Invisible? Much to my education these seldom unused and seemingly wasted buffs were as much protection and more valuable than the group magical resistence and health buffs that they defended.  Nagafen could and would begin to remove any magical defenses we had upon us, so the important ones were deeply covered in great layers of 'useless' protections and spells.  As group after group became covered in various magiks they were asked to bed and relax so as not to allow the 'buffs' to slowly deplete.<br><br>When my group was bedded, so to speak, we entered a dreamland where disembodied spirits talked.  Aye!  I was one of the disembodied!  Jesting and light heartedness and frequent assurances that all was at hand, I listened quietly to the chatter and awaited the instructions the Master Leader was about to speak.<br><br>Though not his exact words, this is my best remembrance and interpretations:<br><br>"We are a group of thirty bent on the destruction of the foul dragon Nagafen.  Certain items are reserved for certain others, though some things will be available to all with a need before greed basis.  These are the groups that will be formed...."<br><br>I heard my name listed in the second group, and was heartened that my leader was someone I had grown to appreciate in the short time of this adventure.<br><br>"The actual assault will begin with group one and upon my command all other groups will immediately assault and finish slaying the fell dragon."<br><br>Uhm, sounded simple enough.  Basically wait for a 'go' then 'go' in and begin healing my warrior.<br><br>Unfortunately between times of my leaving the realm of the disembodied to the reoccurence of mind and body, somehow the groups were redivided into six equal groups of five, and the warrior I anticipated to heal was replaced with another.  Though unnerved by this rapidly changing chain of events, I remember Maduber as a valiant and exceptional fighter of some great merit.  It was simply then just a change from one fighter to another.<br><br>It began then.<br><br>Group one charged up the ramp and disappeared.  Suddenly the call came for all to invade Nagafen's domain.  I too, seemingly following instructions, went up the ramp, found steps and a portal into a large area.  Near the back side of the area that was Nagafen's nest, a great battle was being fought.  Almost immediately Maduber was in the midst of battle and taking wounds with greivice rapidity.  Unaware, not that it matters, that I was also being ripped assunder by the dragon's foul roars.  Hardly had the first spell landed to heal Maduber when was I knocked senseless then passed into death at the center of Nagafen's nest!<br><br>I 'respawned', so to speak, quickly memorized Superior Healing and raced back to the dragon's lair.  While traveling up the steps I encountered many racing in terror down the steps.  Imagine my shock to see Nagafen still a full quarter alive and heeding his summons to join him as dinner!<br><br>Again I quickly memmed Superior Heal and also too Celestial Healing, and raced again to attempt to target any one to heal.  Between being feared and summoned I died several more times.  Realizing the futility of trying to heal anyone, I changed tactics to try and assault the dragon directly.  Memorizing an attack spell of some note, at least for a cleric, I raced up to the dragon, hearing the warning given casters repeated between my dense ears to be within melee range for a spell to land successfully, and stood directly under the dragon and began to cast my spell.<br><br>Luckily for a moment the dragon ignored me.  Unluckily the spell was resisted.  Further ill luck came as the dragon simple swated me three times and left me dead again at his feet.  My instruction on dying and futility ended sometime after my seventh death, when I simply quit counting death as significant.  Already my  forty-ninth season was history as well as my intentions to aide somehow in its death without reorganizations.<br><br>It did not happen.<br><br>What strength a warrior naked and unarmed against such a foe?  Quickly recovering his foul health, even the magiks of the casters were easily overcome.  My heart and hopes sank as the last death was by a dragon now nearly fully healed and my meager possessions lay somewhere buried in the pile of corpses that the laughing dragon reigned over.<br><br>Lamentations and accusations abounded, much to my dismay.  Surely those of experience were aware that a hastily assembled group of the inexperienced could lead to a raid of less then stellar success.  Perhaps they were correct in some of their accusations and criticisms.  One thing I do know that they, with their sharp tongues, were saying was not true.  If assaulting the dragon and forcing it back into the corner to be slain was good, then clerics, at least to heal the fighters, must too enter the lair.  The pretense of incredulity as to my entering the lair utterly floored me.  How did they expect me to heal them when they were out of range?<br><br>There was naught to do of course but to begin the sombering ritual of gathering the dead from the steps and finally the incredibly brave rogue (15 seasons old?) actually sneaking into the blodied lair itself to pull the multitude of corpses from the heap.  Wadl you were heroic and most amazing!<br><br>Gratefully I accepted the ressurections by the most high priest and her epic weapon.  As I meditated and healed others, I would soon once more be ressurected and left with no mana and weak.  Other than Wadl the Amazing Rogue and one other Vhenlador (?) there simply was not much use for healing or clarity as the bodies began to pile up around us.<br><br>Although there was talk, and the pretty and powerful Enchantress eager to take revenge, it was also a time when others felt it was time to go their way and find other things to do.  Unfortunately enough were leaving and there were few takers on the mists to join us so the final tally was Nagafen bunches Dragon Party zero.<br><br>Thus was, and so far is my full introduction to the Lair of Nagafen.  Though I had to decline an invitation to raid Vox's lair the next evening, it was not from fear of dying, I have done that quite a bit actually now.  Nor was it from any fear to go anywhere with the leaders of this raid.  We all learn, sometimes painfully, with every misstep.  I would gladly follow this particular guild into a fight.  Hopefully they will invite this simple cleric on another raid when they have it early in the day as I sadly work like a vampire in the dark of night.<br><br>To those I have met on this raid I thank you, for instruction on how to live and how to die.<br><br>Hehe I also now how Tynnkny came so soon to battle, unless I am mistaken, of course.  A dead corpse from a death caused by a mob, not a duel as that only last ten minutes I heard, can act in what I would describe as a death bind.  In the worst case emergency ressurecting that corpse might prove the only way to bring oneself so quickly to battle as a warrior.  Receiving a complete heal and scooping up weapon, though admittedly not the prettiest, especially as being a troll, or most effective, fighting without armor, does give a warrior something to fight with anyway.<br><br>Postscript to whom it may concern:  I have apparently only lost a slight bit of memories, apparently from over eagerly looting a corpse.  So I am once more, halfway... er nearly halfway... through the 49th season of experience.</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

The challenge he offered me while I fought for the cause in the sandy and often blizzard realm of the Dreadlands about Karnor's Castle was to locate and defeat an Ancient Shardwurm and loot the spell he had given it to carry.  Thus I had inadvertantly, at least on my part, managed to find myself in the following predicament.<br><br>I hunkered down deeper into the slight warmth that the deep snow of the strange yet beautiful area about the dark wurm hole called Greater Divide.  How could I have ever happened to be clutching my ragged bearskin cloak and staring at the formidable line of Giant Spearmen?  Surely this was all a mistake!<br><br>I had been deep within the wurm hole, struggling mightily to heal and protect two over eager wurm slayers of admittedly great skill and even greater generousity.  Many wurms were struck down and looted, yet none were the wurm I needed that carried the gift of Rodcet Nif that I craved.  At times we were heavily besieged on all sides as those great brutes fought to evict us from their lair.  Oft times it was slightly slower with just two or three attacking the Fair Enchantress and her friend.  Never was there a moment when we were left in peace and the mana presense was critically low at nearly every moment.<br><br>Busy I was, yet never too busy not to hear a call of need.  At first I thought it was the call of a friend and brother in our guild, the Order of Green Knights, yet later I learned such was not the case.  I responded to the call and heard a calm voice suggesting perhaps I would like to aide another's quest.  Unfortunately I seem to be ever eager to adventure and so I heartily agreed to make my way up the river and thus to meet in front of the Dwarven Town there that is hidden behind the mists and sprays of a great water fall that creates the river at its foot.  Time was passing fast, and the other two members of the wurm group was not slowing down in the least, so eventually I had to beg them to allow me to leave.  The air was filled with the rumors of war.  I could not fanthom why, was there not enough evil in the world that war was ever to be engaged?<br><br>Frazzled from my just ended fruitless wurm adventure, I was stunned by the sight that greeted me.  Aye the sun was shining brightly, that enough of a surprise from being in the darkened depths of the lair.  But to my utter surprise there was a great multitude of people assembled with great arms and even greater magiks!  I was in complete awe as I gazed about me in an area I often found near deserted.  Priests of near every god of great level was joined with the most vile Iskars, Trolls, and Dark Elves!  Aye the Shamans, Warriors, Wizards and, yes, people of all races and classes were seeming to be joining forces!  And all of them seemed very learned and aged, thus once more teaching me the humility of being one so young in his god's sevice.<br><br>The one that called me from the depths of the wurm cavern greeted me and asked if I would set awhile as the forces began to assemble in groups.  I tried to count the assembled, yet there were far too many for me to count.  This list I gathered of just the wizards, magicans,and other summoners of instant death, was at least twenty or more names of notables that were every one more senior and experienced than I.  These were perhaps the fewest in number!<br><br>Right behind me began to assemble a group that both inspired me and filled me with great fear.  It was the ressurection group headed by a godlike cleric of great report skill and he carried a weapon of great magiks.  Reportedly he could raise the dead and bring back all remembrances and skills!  Flanking him were two fearsome rogues of great experience and I can not now recall who else attended to this Supreme Healer, I was simply to filled with awe and a great fear as I contemplated with my lack of knowledge what possible event might be occurring that a group like this was summoned to perform resurrecting of the fallen!<br><br>Lists were ever being compiled, and I was sore afraid to add my name to the list of clerics.  Thankfully, Rodcet Nif be praised, clerics were the first asked to join the gathering by list.  I was assigned to an Eastern Battalion.  Battalion?  Yes, the Master Leader was forming not groups as I have only experienced, he was literally forming armies!  Dutifully I ventured to the site of the Eastern Battalion assemply point, there met already a multitude of many all mightier than I. It appeared, though clerics were first assembled by list, much planning had already occurred and many already knew before hand into which Battalion they would be engaged in.  Perhaps the lists being compiled by the Master Leader was more to ease the tremulous that joined his cause or perhaps just to make sure all unexpected participants were charted and assigned, such as I was.<br><br>I knelt humbly by a great white bear and asked what was going on.  (Why not ask a bear?  Seemed far less threatening then the skeletons, Iskars, Ogres, Trolls, and others who just by the glint of their weapons or sparkling of their Magiks caused my heart to beat rapidly and my knees to tremble to the verge of collapse!)  To my astonishment the bear began to speak in soft dulcimer tones explaining he was a shaman who was giving service to the Master Leader Tynkny (spelling is off I know) who was completing a great quest, this last part was known as the tenth ring.<br><br>It seemed that when Tyknny (sounded like Tiny)gave something to the Dwarves of Coldain and/or something verbal, the leader of the dwarves would accept his offer of alliance to defend the dwarven outpost.  This was no small event.  Instead it was and incredible and awesome enough event that the snows, hills and even the carvern and the wurms took note of!  Nothing and no one was going to interfere in the upcomming event.  No wurm would spawn and attack anyone, even the wolves that frequented the area would slink off to hide will the terrifying event took place.  Were it not for the tone of his voice and his calm demeanor I too would have fled the area, what possible event would be so dire and terrifying that even the wolves would tuck tail and hide until all was returned to order?<br><br>"We are about to engage in a war.  It is quite simple really," the great bear spoke as he examined his mighty clawed paw leisurely.  "We will either succeed in defending this small simple minded folk or die."  I stared at him, his great maul curled in a smile and eyes glittering in anticipation of the kill!  I surely swooned in fear for I remember not much else, save a wild race to a small valley and the orders to defend such valley from giants soon to appear.<br><br>Unfortunely I do remember one utterly mystifying thing (for I know no other term that would detail this strange...er.... thing!)  I was chosen my the Eastern Battalion Leader to lead a group of five others!  Forgive me Nif for my so tremulous quivering, yes I thank you deeply that the great bear was also of the group!  Though I remember not his name it sort of remined me of something like apignew but that is very far off and that is certain.  Then there was the sudden race through the deep snow to the valley as directed and the admonishment still ringing in my ears to never, at any time, advance towards the Giant Spearmen as they would summon you and with great alarcity impale you to a most indignant death!<br><br>Which brings me once more to my huddled form in the old bear skin cape deep in a bank of snow, taking what comfort I could take from the sight of the great bear comfortably gazing at the line of Giant Spearmen.  Around me swirled rumors even more confusing then the oft swirling gusts of snow.  "Are we in the right valley?"  "Aye the giants will be attacking from the spearmen's left flank coming up this valley."  The sound of battle came easily through the frigid cold!  "All ASSIST ME ON ..." the sound of the Master Leader rang through out the zone.  "Heal Tynnkny!"  "Attacking ..."  "All attack ..." "WE are being flanked to the right, swing right!"  "... down, ressurect him!"  I trembled as the words, excited by war, yet seemed so controlled and experience, came to my ears.  And yet I could only wait, stare with the bear at the yet unmoving line of Spearmen, and dread the fear welling in my belly.<br><br>"Eastern Battalion assist to your right!"  Those words rang in my ears, stunning me to sudden shock!  I leapt up and saw the great bear and our whole battalion already scrambling up the sides of the valley, some already disappearing as they dropped over the top!  I too raced, though admittedly more to just be with someone far away from the territying yet unmoving line of the great enemy, then in great anticipation of battle.  Yet, too, I had given my word, thus a solemn unbreakable vow to a person I am sure does not know I even exist.  I let duty, the fact that I am, though young and unworthy, a healer of Rodcet Nif, and my sudden friendship with this great bear take me over the hill and into a swirling cyclone of events that engulfed me.<br><br>I had thought the Eastern Battalion had advanced apparently much farther than we had!  For immediately I recognized we were just south of Coldain!  The Middle Army was in a terrific contest with many dead and dying littering the once glittering pure white of the Great Divide with blood and corpses of fallen heroes and hewn giants!  The beast beside me roared in pleasure and raced down the slippery slope and launched his great bulk into the very midst of the advancing line of giants that treatened to break around the Middle Battalion's flank!  With the drunkedness of war, I too raced to battle that which assaulted the hosts of my Master Leader.<br><br>(Sure wish I could remember that bear's name, for Tynnkny would be amazed at his fearlessness and bravory!)  Appigneu ?  not correct I know.<br><br>The great bear received a might blow that sent his blood and fur to add further to the ruined picturesqueness of the wonderous area.  I immediately began to summon health for him, casting the mightiest of heals of short spell duration.  Yet Superior healing seemed hardly to dent the terrific damage done to my newest of friends!  Again and again I cast the healing spells, yet the etheral mists of the zone seemed to deny me the ability to heal any of my quickly ailing group!  Futilely I stepped closer, the bear's bulk filling my vision as he still, though now half alive, rose on his hind feet and took massive bites of giant flesh and spit them to the ground.  Fully, terrifyingly, twenty or thirty seconds after I cast my first heal spell, I saw a slight rise in the bear's health.<br><br>Then I was driven, still standing, feet first into the frozen snow and ground, crumbling instantly when the giant brought his great fist down on my head!  Perhaps it took more than one blow, yet the swirling confusion of the zone and the terribly ther mists, most assuredly had frozen me at the giants feet and thus to my sudden painful death.<br><br>By the time I had awakened at the bind point just inside Coldain, I was already being revived by the godlike cleric!  Instantly I was standing at my corpse, though with little health, very tired, and no mana with which to heal.  I immediately looted the corpse at my feet and felt the sudden fresh breeze fill my mind and yet other magiks from the attending enchanter!  Wisdom filled my mind, though I would need a second to rest to accept the influx of mana from the mists.<br><br>With just a heals worth of mana I sluggishly went to find my group of which only the great bear and another.  As I approached the littered area of corpses and battle, again the etheral mists of the zone began to dull my senses.  Though I saw not my great friend, I head his call from the original valley we were to defend!  I immediately tried to race to his aid, yet came immediately upon yet another great contest!  Several giants were far too close to the town!  I immediately began to heal, and thus apparently, again sealed my fate of death.  The last I saw as I crumpled into the snow was the giant stepping over me and another giant fallin like a great tree, felled by our mighty forces!<br><br>Though the etheral mists of the zone was greatly impeding me, I managed several times to enter the great war, once even to attain the battle in our valley and finding comfort that the great bear had taken over leadership of the group and had gathered most of my former members and another ungrouped participant of this terrible great war.<br><br>I can not now tell you whether we managed to defeat the enemy in or valley or if indeed they managed to flank us.  For as the etheral mists hindered me, giants seemed every where, storming down slopes determined to slay those oddly indifferent ungrateful dwarves!  Soon I was back at the entrance to Coldain, advancing drunkedly with fatigue and battling a mist that threatened to obliterate me utterly from the zone.<br><br>I saw it then.<br><br>It was in essense the last of the great battles.  The wave of the giants, think it was called the third wave, was comprised of their most elite and highest ranking giants.  Reputed to have been all of sixty seasons, though I could not confirm that rumor.  Not only were there few of them left standing to assail the dwarves, Tyknny was swinging his weapon standing toe to toe with the greatest of all giants.  Corpses seemed to be tripping friend and foe alike at every movement.  Many valiant heroes and and heroiness contested the advancing giants dressed as on the day of their birth, taking just the moment to heft great sword or spell ere returning to Tynnkny's aide.<br><br>Despite the infernal ehteral mists that sorely treated me, I saw my greatest of heroes, being bashed and slashed for great damage.  My last successful targeting and casting was at that great hulk of Troll flesh. Perhaps ogre? Tis hard at times to discern the difference without looking at the purple eyes and hooked beak of a nose!  The spell of mine or another, though I heard confirmation through the mists that Tynnky ws completely healed, landed solidly and gave me great joy.  Alas the mists refused to lessen their assault on my person, and I could do more but futilely attempt to heal who Tynnkny was calling someone to heal.  Unfortunately I saw Tyknny fall in death, yet was shocked to see him come running near naked from the town, stoop and retrieve just his weapon and again assail that terrible giant!  The giant was soon felled and a great shout of victory was heard through out the zone!  Apparently, though there were yet a couple giants left standing, the war, and its goals were seemingly complete.  'Course it helped, I presume, as the giants that were left standing were suddenly overwhelmed in great forces and sent rapidly to the blood soaked tundra.<br><br>I could barely sit there, the excitement and joy, no perhaps better called elation, ran so deep and wide throughout the area.  Congrateulations flew through the air and continued impressively even when those wolves, dwarves, and wurms re-entered the Greater Divide.  (Seemed quite a rude shock when the most ungrateful of dwarves actually attacked one of the gallant that had just successfully saved their hovel from being swept from the face of Norrathe!)  Be that as it may, there were yet more rejoicing and congratulations as items looted found new owners.  Laughter and shouts filled the area.<br><br>My quiet voice for a sow went unheeded, so I just shrugged my shoulders, again huddled into the warmth of my comforting robe, and began the short walk to the Eastern Wastelands and the Dreadlands that summoned me to regain the level lost.  I guess in my excited state I was too eager to accept or wait for a ressurection, accepting the full mana as a greater gift then the memories of the past.<br><br>Though I learned I was not a good enough cleric to battle giants and etheral mists of a zone in battle, I was happy and joyous in heart and spirit.  To that great warrior, I owe many thanks.  To that great bear I owe much comfort and beg the day comes when I might again be at his side, more secure in my abilities to heal.  To the others that attended that great war, you have instructed me in ways not imagined previously, and I thank you everyone.  But mostly I wish to thank whomever it was that first whispered to me of their desire for me to partake of the event and Rodcet Nif for inviting me to be where I was when I was.  Were it not for that unknown individul and my quest to obtain the elusive spell, I would not have been able to partake in the most exciting adventure in my 44 ... er 43 .. hehehe ... seasons!</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

Hp, Cleric, uhm, that's me, have no idea, about 1.5k maybe.<br><br>Monkey pulls mob, FD's, Warrior A gets aggro, enchanter waits (Everwise) lets Warrior A develope good aggro, Tash, Slow, etc, Warrior B starts attacking.  Perfect A is the only one losing hp and is slowing going to half health.  Cleric's finger itching to cast CompHeal!<br><br>Warrior B begins to taunt!  NO!  Warrior B begins to lose hp gets a bubble down and has aggro!  Warrior A not getting it back!  CelHeal Warrior B (10% mana comsumption).  Not healing fast enough! Cast SupHeal (10% mana consumption)!  B gets nervous or something, quits hitting, Cel heal times out hardly healing at all.<br><br>Warrior A now just getting to two bubbles, announce inc heal to warrior A, announce incoming CompHeal(near 20% just a bit less) to Warrior A, watch the ungodly slow spell begin, watch ranger go ape@#%^ and get aggro!  Cleric begins to panic.  Ranger dropping faster than spell cast!  Ranger screams heal me!  Cleric futiley clicking SupHeal, not able to heal.  Finally Warrior A completely healed, cast SupHeal (10%).  Monkey going Ape@#%^! CelHeal monkey (10%).  Warrior A gets aggro back!  Two bubbles down, mob nearly dead, CelHeal A (10%).  Loses aggro to Warrior B again, monkey wants more, celHeal B (10%), CelHeal monkey (10%).  Mob falls dead, CelHeal has healed all to full, monkey zooms off, brings two more!<br><br>Stupid Cleric always 00m!<br><br>Help!<br><br>Ideal!  Warrior keeps above aggro to two red bubbles, all see inc heal, all see inc CompHeal (20%) to Warrior A all begin counting and watching his health.  He is at one bubble and 7 of 10 secs passed, let him KEEP aggro, three seconds later he is half bubble or less.  Whoohoo! completely healed! Cleric sitting on his tailend!  Lost half a bubble in the first second.  Taunt, slash, stomp on his toes, P!SS in his boots, I do not care get the aggro!  Warrior A quit swinging!<br><br>Warrior A either retains Aggro and lives, or B got agro and he lives.  Whoever has aggro, keep it!  Ranger playing a DoT with his weapons.  Mob dying, Warrior B two bubbles low, CelHeal (10%).  Warrior A casually chomping on the mob.  CelHeal just keeping up.  Warrior A goes taunt happy gets aggro.  Mob dies.  CelHeal finishes on B now just half bubble low, Warrior A bubble low, Ranger, Enchanter near full if not full, monkey gets a shot of GreatH (5%).  Cleric at 55% or better since I am allowed to sit through most of the fight, probably closer to 65 or 70m.<br><br>Uhm, cleric gtg at 70m, monkey do your thing!<br><br>Side bit:  Ranger see that wandering Mob headed for aggro range of fight?  You don't?  Please do!  Harmony it and it might just walk through the fight and not get involved!  (It does that frequently I am happy to report in Karnor's Castle, Captain's room.)  Enchanter decide if we want it as next target, mezz or not, you decide.  Has the aggro maintenance of the group allowed the cleric to stay seated and med?<br><br>Please the cleric only has som much mana whether he has a wisdom of 200+ or my 180.  200 mana is not much!  One fairly heafty heal and it is gone!  You want a round of AoF?  Sure, coming up! Six members AoF 55% mana drain.  Not a good time to pull multiples!  Oh you want Reso too, 6 or less Reso's and cleric is 00m.  Uhm not willing to wait are you?<br><br>Why did you put AoF and Reso on him and not me? I am bigger!  Duh, because he dies faster than you?<br><br>Enchanter, you will have AoF, or now Shield of Words, Reso, and Symbol on at all times.  You will tell me when they have gone!  Know that often times in heavy battle even I do not have shields on any longer so have no idea when yours are dropping!  I LOVE YOU MAN!  You die, good chance we are all dead men walking.  You mezzed a mob?  Mind blur.  Demand the mob gets rooted! Don't allow the mob's filthy weapon to soil your pretty dress, er robe!<br><br>Please help the cleric.  Watch the aggro.  Careful demanding buffs then not waiting.  Kill that silly puppy that keeps me from staying on my lazy *&&.  Else go bring me, or take me to get some armor with clickable effects!<br><br>If you are reading cleric is 00m and you, the mighty warrior has just recieved a greatHeal.  For pete's sake do not go wading back into the fray!  You got the greater healing only because that is all I have left!  Da mob wipes that out in seconds, far sooner than I can med it back! Please, Please let that other warrior keep aggro even though he is only two red bubbles left alive!  Maybe the ranger has some mana and can heal you a little, I DO NOT!  Let me med to get whatever slight mana I can to put on the other warrior!  If your near dead standing corpse is within range, that mob is going to kill you!  It is even better if I get up and start swinging my silly little club then for you to taunt him with your near corpse condition.  And believe me I am no battle cleric!  But I do have 1.5k or so hp more than you do now and not all that bad at defense! (188)<br><br>/rant off<br><br>Sorry lost three today and mad as heck!  Puppy would not let me sit, warriors playing too much tag with aggro, no enchanter and bard trying to help keep warriors alive out of mana song range, not that I was able to sit and enjoy the music!  We owned that right moat and basement pulls for a long while!  We were a great group.  Bard was enchanter equivalent to above, wizard the ranger.  Still awed watching Cronchoker keeping mob busy and not getting too hurt!

	     <tr><td valign=top id=fs8 class=mform><span id=notbold>By:</span> <a href=poster.html?user=46685><span id=Sage>Laleldil</span></a><br><b><span id=Sage>Sage</span></b><br><span id=notbold>91 posts<br><span id=notbold>Score</span>: Excellent [4.80]</td><td valign=top class=mform width=100%><p>In another journal one asked how to view the pictures he took as he wished to tell an illustrated tale.&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end I will put a more detailed filled description as to how I manage the pictures.<br><br>First of all you are going to take some great pictures!  That gorgeous enchantress that just gave you a round of crack and even now is casting yet another spectacular spell would be the perfect subject.  Or is it that elephant lying dead at the very top of a tree in Southern Karana the picture you want?  Or perhaps you are providing a detailed description of a dungeon for your guild mates and want them to actually see the turns and rooms before they are confronted with monsters of all kinds.  Pictures of course can clear things up or make them murky depending in your skill and patience.<br><br>Before you take that picture though think a few seconds on why you want the picture and to what you hope to use it!  Is it a new found friend you wish to immortalize in living, er dead, color?  Please leave the display PC names on.  Make sure the name tag is nicely contrasted and legible.  Should you rather tell a tale in role play then most likely you would not like the confusion of so many overlapping names 'dirtying' the picture.  Surely Sir Galahad never rode into battle with his name tag joining a host of other name tags!  If you are making a pictorial sequence for others to follow, try to put your curser pointing at the key part you wish them to notice.  But most of all have fun and snap frequently.  Quick punching the - key can give something interesting, I'll explain later.<br><br>Using the F10 key changes your screen I believe from a windowed format, to a windowed format with clear frames, and then a full screen picture without anything else on the screen. A third F10 will bring you back to the original screen.  What you see picture-wise is the same content in all three modes with just the size of the picture varying.  The windowed picture has just as much view area as the full screen only smaller, like looking at a 5x7 or an 8x10 of the same picture.<br><br>Using F9 alters the angle from which the picture on the screen is viewed.  It is a camera-like function.  Perhaps as you are trying to explain the pathing of a mob or which entrance to go through, the overhead view would explain it best. In Karnor's castle the first two guardians run to the center of the path, then come down the center to attack you the intruder.  On over head view can be used with lines drawn in towards the center and then down the hall.  By doing this with several diferent monsters you will notice how they move to get friends just before they come for you.  By attacking the right one on the right side, will it still run to your left and then to you? Uhm, a picture can help.<br><br><br>You have now taken your pictures:  Where are they?<br>Answer: In your Everquest directory.  If you did the normal install, probably, if I am not mistaken, Verant thought it would be nice to put Everquest in your Program folder on the main root of your C drive.  For those of you who have decided to put the game in a games folder, like I did, then Everquest is in that folder.<br><br>Question: Where and what are they?<br>Answer: Eq0000.bmp is the first picture you took.  The next one is eq0001 and so on.  Now I am not a computer whiz, so I won't even try to explain what a bmp file is other than it is apparently one of the simplest of graphics files that most all programs can display, from your paint program in windows accessories to the most complex of programs.  It is huge.<br><br>Question: How do I view this picture?<br>Answer: By finding the file with windows explorer, most likely you can preview it right in explorer.  You can also double click the file name and your default image viewer for bmp's will open the picture.<br><br>Question: Now what?<br>Answer: Now you have to decide what you are intending to do and how many pictures you are going to be taking.<br><br>I, personally, created a screenshot folder in everquest.  Inside screenshot I created a temp folder.  Since I use PaintshopPro5, though I imagine most all image programs like imagefolio, PhotSuite, etc have similar mechanics, I will go through the process I use.  P5 has a convert sub program under file tab.  By setting the destination folder to temp, I can select all the bmp from eq0000 to the last eq00xx and simply click convert.  Whala! eq0000.jpd in temp folder and eq0000.bmp in everquest folder.  CAREFULLY delete eq0000.bmp, you might check eq0000.jpg first but it should be okay.<br><br>Now you still got some things to do!  Rename these files!  Your next screenshot will be eq0000.bmp!  You now already have a eq0000.jpg!  Make yet more folders!  I made folders for various zones like SKarana, EKarana, HighholdP, etc.  'Guildmates' is another good name and 'maps'.  Name your new eq0000.jpg something informative.  skarana0000.jpg perhaps.  You can now save 10,000 pictures of skarana and all of them can have a different name, everyone of them right where you expect it to be (time wise).  Sneaking in at level 12? skarana0000 might be the first sight you saw.  Now a fearless uber warrior skarana1223.jpg will be much lower in the list.<br><br>Break out and dust off your cdwriter!  If you become addicted to taking pictures you will want to start cleaning your C drive of the thousands of pictures you quickly accumulate!<br><br>Remember the previously mentioned quick punches of screenshot key I mentioned earlier?  Lets look at that for a second or so.  You are witnessing a a terrific battle and not really doing all that much yourself.  I am a cleric so have some seconds at times to do this.  Quick go put pc names off, quick go to full screen adjust view, sit, jump up, look higher, sit again, and start punching key.  Whew!  Fight was won and you took 25 pictures.<br><br>Now outside of Eq.  I still use P5.  I convert as normal.  Use the program my friend created to automatically sequencially rename pictures.  Now we have fight0000.jpg to fight0024.jpg.  Open P5's animation program.  Insert pictures in sequence and create animated gif!  Ah! a short home movie of the fight in living color!<br><br>If I figure out how to give access to a program from my website I will put a flag here to send you there should you want a sequencing naming program.  Since it was a modification of another program he wrote to move files and such it is slightly confusing, but the part I use is exceptionally easy.<br><br>Though windy, I hope this helps all the aspiring journalists to get their pictures!  Display them proudly, not everyone has gotten where you have been and we eagerly await your illustrated tales of glory.<br><br>Laleldil Tremulous &lt;Order of Green Knights&gt;<br>49 Cleric in Rodcef's service<br>Tholuxe Paells server</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

Not to start any discussions on what guild is better or any other flames, I do not wish to leave my guild.<br><br>However since my guild is young and will be slow to mature to the ability to do planar raids and epic proportion raids, I would like to find a way to go on various outings that will teach me the better ways of being a cleric and also the methods and other aspects that need attention for a guild to start these endeavors.<br><br>I have followed the links here on Allakhazam's page and found the Tholuxe Paells Server and its forum.  I have perused the general discussions pages for quite some time and various other pages and unfortunately this server seems rift with flames and animosity at the high end of the game.  I am sure that this is not enveloping all high end players or even most of the players in the variuous guilds, yet in the general discussions page, threads become unbearably long with flames that have nothing to do with the original intent of the post, or at least as I see it.<br><br>Obviously I am not qualified to even come close to having a working relationship with alot of these people, however I have bumped into one or two of them during the game and have had no problems with them and at least one of them has helped me out in Karnor's Castle.<br><br>This I hope has shown that my question I am about to ask needs not be answered in flames or other than helpful manners.  Please if you need to flame someone, something, or even me, please go to the server site, a flame page, or just email me at laleldil@qtm.net.  Thank you.<br><br>I would like to be 'adopted', so to speak, by another guild that would be willing to help teach me the ways that would be most benefical to my guild.  I would, of course, be willing to follow all the adopting guild's requisites except to leave my guild.  I do not have naything of real value as evidenced by my low wisdom and few funds, yet I would attempt to follow your guild's customs to the best of my ability that do not conflict with the Charter and spirit of my own present guild.<br><br>Things that I would like to learn are how to be an excellent cleric, what is the way raids are run and executed, and anything else the adopting guild would think would help me help my guild mates.  I am not an officer of the guild that I am in, yet I am seeking this assistance on my own, so do not wish this message to anyway tarnish my guild's reputation.  It is a noble guild of friends that I hold dear.<br><br>Again please no flames or cuts and slams to other guilds or other individuals.  Any positive and teaching postings to this journal would be and will be read and heeded to the best of my ability with the gratuitousness befitting a Knight of the Green Order.<br><br>Thank you for your presence and thoughtfulness<br><br>Laleldil Tremulous<br>a 49 cleric in search of learning and wisdom</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

With luck the Temple of Life would hold me even higher within their favor and perhaps even give me a more noble quest to perform.  I paused in the Pass to again look into the ever continuing struggle underneath the Keep.  True to form, young folk of Norath had again banded together and valiantly fought to stop yet another rush of vermin that threatened the security of the Keep.  I watched from the top of the stairs, occasionally casting the spells I had come to accept as my greatest of gifts the Temple had bestowed upon me.  As the furious pace slowed and all seemed secure for the moment, I continued by own travels and headed out across Eastern Karana.<br><br>Actually travel had become somewhat easier as I had put a few more seasons behind me.  Being allowed the ability to set my own bind spots, something I have never yet been able to accurately understand,  gave me some advantages others were not so fortunate to have.  When I am overcome and need the gods to bring me back, I usually, if I remembered, had a much shorter travel to &#8216;loot my corpse&#8217;.  With this freedom I had ventured farther afield around Freeport, my adopted town, and Qeynos, the town I seemed to have originated from.  I, though obviously not bold and brave, hence the name that was given to me by the Temple, Tremulous, had traveled a few seasons across the mighty ocean wandering Butcherblock, Faydwer, and parts to the Karanas with a few hard fought seasons spent in Split Paw Lair.  I often thought of a cleric I had met in Qeynos and tried to emulate him in every way possible. I still warmed my innards to remember one fine beautiful morning outside Felwithe.<br><br>I had just gotten up from my rest and meditation when this most spectacularly beautiful High Elf lady asked if I could help her get her corpse.  Hehe, how could I refuse!  Summoning forth the magiks given me, I covered her in every form of safety I could give her.  Protection of the gods, more health from courage, and the symbol that was mine at the time.  Not stopping there, perhaps admittedly to impress her, I continued my casting buffing her against the perils of poison, disease, fire, cold, and even magik!  I gallantly stood up as she giggled nervously and offered to escort her to her corpse.  &#8220;Really, kind Sir, my corpse is just over the rise there.  I will be quite safe enough in your magiks and my invisibility!&#8221;  Suddenly she disappeared!  Though I heard her yet before me, &#8220;Perhaps now safe from you.&#8221;  Once more her laughter tinkled like silvery bells in my ears.  Yes, as I think about it now, perhaps she was correct.  She was beautiful!<br><br>But that was long ago and even her name is becoming cloudy from poor memory.  Eyllane?  My how terrible it feels to begin to forget the beauty we have seen.<br><br>Coming across Eastern Karana I managed to kill a small number of giant spiders of varying breeds.  As I neared the wooden bridge to Northern Karana, I happened upon a Crag Spider, perhaps noted as being one of the deadliest spiders of all Antonica.  Though not completely filled with the mana I could have had, I quickly smote the spider with magiks, then began to swing my Wraith Bone hammer as fast as I could swing it.  As unfortunately it seems to happen frequently, my magikal buffing began to drop of one by one.  Cold, fire, and magic buffs were of no loss, but I became scared when the poison buff also faded away.  Not to be out done, the last three buffs also decided to fade away, leaving me alone to face the spider with only my hammer and my small pool of mana.<br><br>The spider&#8217;s sharp talons cut into my skin frequently, then his evilly poisoned fangs bit into my arm and I felt the searing burn as the poison was pumped into my body!  I swung frantically at the dark head and merely glanced the chitinous surface.  Another talon stabbed into my thigh.  One that gave me the pleasure of hearing it cracking, making the spider scream its eery scream as my hammer bashed it into pieces!  Though, at first thought, close to the safety of the bridge that the spider could not cross, it became terrifyingly evident as the poison coursed through my body and weakened me, one of us, possibly both of us was going to die.  Savagely the battle raged for what seemed like hours and mere seconds.  Talon cutting deep as often as my hammer cracking the tough skin of the spider.  Green ichor from the spider mingled and blended with the bright red of my own freely flowing blood.  Panic and terror threatened to make my swings even weaker and more inaccurate as my health was dropping just as fast as the spider seemed to be flagging.  As the last of my magiks was again resisted by the spider, I knew my death had once more come to claim me.  I cried in frustration and gave one last mighty crushing blow with my hammer and the spider turned away!  Do I run to the bridge and safety?  No there was no safety there, the poison yet ran through my body and my death was already sealed.  Angrily I charged after that terrible menace, blow after blow not landing and crashing against the bright red bulb of evil.  Finally with one last screech of pain the spider crumbled in a heap.<br><br>I stood panting feeling the last of life leave my body.  I knelt and examined the corpse and found nothing of value.  The last I remembered was collapsing in the blood of our battle and coming to rest on the hard slick shell of the spider.<br><br>I entered into the town of Riverdale.  The streets were quaintly curved around tiny little cottages.  Strange how serene an area can be after the terrors of Kithicor Forest.  In a small open area between two such small cottages I observed an old dwarf overseeing the play of a pretty little elfin girl whose age was hard to tell.  After all, dwarves live several hundred years, elves even twice as long, and us humans hardly ever see a hundred, yet we all seem to age the same.  Would the young elfin Maiden be a hundred, thus far older than I and almost half as old as the dwarf that sat tending her?  I put her age as I could understand, she was about five, maybe six tops in human years.<br><br>The little maiden crawled up into the old dwarven lap and nestled against the chest of the old dwarf.<br><br>&#8220;Tell me a story.&#8221; Her voice sounded so sweetly as an elderly Elfin Matron came forth from the cottage behind them with a tankard of Dwarven Brew and a thin narrow class of Elven Wine.  &#8220;Please.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; the Dwarf groused, thought he twinkle in his eyes gave away his true feelings.<br><br>&#8216;One day very long ago, a young man was walking through the hills of Butcherblock, following a trail not often used.  Well he happened upon the main path just as a young elfin Maid, not too much older than you, came crashing out of the brambles and briars that lined the main path.  The young man quickly and gallantly came to the Maid&#8217;s rescue, casting a root to the orc that chased her, a heal to the Maid, then struck quickly and fiercely against the orc with both magik and might.  Well the battle ended almost before it began and the orc soon lay at the man's feet.&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;The two decided to travel a ways together for safety.&#8217; The dwarf gave a grunt of laughter, &#8216;not that the man needed any protection!&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;He began to lead down the somewhat narrow path with the pretty Elfin Maiden, almost as pretty as you, following closely behind.  Wouldn&#8217;t you know some orc would have jumped out of the trees along the path and gave the Maid a mean and vicious blow with his rusty sword.  As he rapidly turned to attack he saw the orc&#8217;s arm uplifted and poised to come down to deal a deadly blow to the beautiful maiden.  Instantly he stunned the orc with magik and rushed to put himself between the injured elf and danger.  This orc legionnaire was even harder than the previous orc and the battle raged for several long minutes, yet once again the man was able to defend the beautiful Maid from evil.&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;Well the man decided perhaps it would be best if the Maid walked in front of the man, then he could protect her cute little bottom.&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;&#8216;Grandpa!&#8217; the cute little girl laughed and playfully swatted him with her tiny hand on his worn battle armor, &#8216;you bad.&#8217;&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;Uhmph, the old dwarf laughed, &#8216;Well she was beautiful to look at as he followed her.  But suddenly two more legionnaires crashed through the underbrush and charged down the path, only this time they came from up the path and again attacked the maiden first.  The man again had to rush to interject himself between the Maid and danger and nearly fell as one legionnaire&#8217;s sword clanged against the man&#8217;s up held shield.  As the force of the blow resounded amid the trees, the man let out a grunt as the pain to the blow to his unprotected side landed solid against his ribs.&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;Well the Maiden eyes just seemed to flash in anger!  It was something to see!  Those pretty blue eyes blazing, she stopped one of the orcs completely!  As the man gave battle to the one before him, the Maid let off a flurry of magiks.  The orc&#8217;s eyes showed his quavering fear as he was suddenly much weaker and slower.  More and more of the man&#8217;s hammer blows crushed against him and he tried to run away in terror.  The man easily killed the orc with just a few more strikes against his gutless body.  The second orc was still just standing there, though the terror could be seen in his eyes!  The man rooted the orc with magiks then simple beat the helpless orc to death.  The foul villains!&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;The battle was short but very educational.  Alone, neither of them, man nor maiden would have survived the dangers of the path.  The cleric could not have killed without the aid of the enchantress and the enchantress could not of cast her magiks before their vile weapons would have cut her down.  It also taught them that one before the other was not the safest of ways.  No, it was much safer to travel side by side, shoulder to shoulder.&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;Well the path wound around the area and frequently their arms touched each other, though not intentionally mind you!  But soon their accidental touching became more pleasant and it was not long before they were laughing and chatting and even sometimes holding hands.  They talked of many things and shared many stories until the path stopped with two smaller paths branching off, one to the right and one to the left.  She had planned on taking the left path and he had planned on taking the right path.  They stopped and turned to face each other, he looking down into the beautiful slender elfin face.  He was no longer certain that he wanted to go down that path alone, and he could see by the look in her pale blue eyes that she too was uncertain of her desires.  The two touched hands together again, only this time it was intentional, a reaching out between man and maiden.  Her hand lifted slender fingers that caressed the man&#8217;s cheek and lips and he could not stop his own hand from reaching out to touch the trembling lips of the maiden.  In unison the hands came together, lips finally meeting and their embrace tight.  Man and Maiden seemed to fit together, he larger and stronger covering her frail slender body, she dainty and soft felt perfect within his arms and upon his chest.  As they stood there silently, he felt how soft she was, yet also felt how strong she was.  She was not a helpless young maiden, no, she was an enchantress with a backbone of determination, strength, and resolve.  He also learned he was not strong and mighty as he had thought he was.  His knees trembled just holding her! Then they parted, though still unwilling to loose the hold on the other&#8217;s hand.  The man and maiden looked down the paths that they had thought to travel.  Both seemed to lead in relative safety to whatever destinations life&#8217;s paths take them, yet to take either of the paths together was impossible.  Fingers entwined tightened and they chose neither path but stepped together out into the unknown.&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;Grandpa you funny! You not taller than Grandma so you could not look down into her &#8216;pretty eyes&#8217;!&#8217; The young elfin girl giggled.  Her tiny hands touched the garrulous old man&#8217;s face as she giggled.  &#8216;Dwarves are always shorter than Elves and you just a softie old dwarf&#8221; <br><br>&#8216;With that the old Elfin Enchantress, the old Dwarvin Cleric, and the small child laughed in the way only possible by the love of togetherness.&#8217;<br><br>I seemed to remember a touch to my body as I laid against the cold remains of the spider.  A breeze seemed to fill my mind and wisdom flowed freely.  Too I vaguely seem to picture old gray dwarven eyes looking at me then the swirl of healing that was far greater than anything I had yet been able to cast.  Yet when I rose from the dust, there was no one about me!  Nor was there any signs on my person that I had just fought a most deadly fight.  If it were not for the corpse of the spider, perhaps I would have felt myself insane.  Yet the remembrance of Riverdale was just as clear, though there was no proof to be seen!  I could not have imagined it for I had only once been to Riverdale and though promptly getting lost, soon departed the same way I entered.  Surely I would have remembered such a sight if I had truly witnessed it!<br><br>Confused I put one boot before the other, going to the river and washing the grime of death from person and weapon.  When I stood I glanced again to the site of my last battle, still nothing, just the bulk of the dead crag spider.  Slowly I turned away, that dream or vision bringing back the memory of that beautiful Elfin Maiden so many seasons and battles past.  It was a strange empty ache as I stepped unto the wooden bridge, one I knew neither the magiks of Enchantress or Cleric was ever going to be able to fill or heal.<br><br>As the man began to cross the bridge an Elfin Enchantress began to appear.  Then beside her appeared an old Dwarven Cleric and an old High Elf Enchantress with a young elfin girl standing between them<br><br>&#8216;Thank you Mother and Father.&#8217; The beautiful woman said.<br><br>&#8216;He isn&#8217;t much is he?&#8217; Grulos grunted.<br><br>&#8216;Not yet, but he could be.  After all you weren&#8217;t such a great cleric if I remember right at his age, without me around.&#8217;  Playfully and to the little girl&#8217;s delight the enchantress bonked the cleric&#8217;s helm with her rod.  &#8216;Remember?&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;Bah!&#8217; Grulos grunted, &#8216;he just isn&#8217;t good enough for Eylianna.&#8217;<br><br>&#8216;I got to hurry!  Love you.  Honey please be good and keep practicing.&#8217;  The elfin woman knelt and gave her daughter a huge hug.<br><br>&#8216;I will Mommie.&#8217; The girl said hugging her mother back in return.  How unjust had been the cruel fates that had stolen her father ere she knew him!<br><br>Without further ado, the man&#8217;s form was growing smaller with every step.  With a sound so faint as to be near silent, the enchantress once more took up the trail of the man.  Upon crossing the bridge she saw a lion patriarch sniffing the man&#8217;s footprints, tail twitching, a deep growl rumbling in its mighty chest.  But when Eylianna finished weaving her magik the lion simply blink and wander away.  A danger he had never even known.<br><br><br>Laleldil Tremulous<br>Thuloxe Paells  (one day I'll spell it correctly)<br>49 seasons a humble cleric<br>&lt;Order of Green Knights&gt;</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

So to all intents and purposes Qeynos was my home.  As I sat there, I admired the new piece of jewelry that I had purchased from Chronchoker, an enchanter that wandered the area frequenty.  (You know that was so long ago I can't even remember what that shiny bit of metal and gem was?)  I felt though, and remember this well, how the gem, held in its precious metal workings, gave me an ability to accept even more of the magical flux that was so vital to casting the spells of healing.  I can also remember how I came to convince Chronchoker to sell me the jewelry at a substantial loss.<br><br>As I seemed to always be doing during my last couple of seasons, I was sitting in the tunnel just outside of the Burrow, healing and medding, simply to be faced again with yet more injured clamoring for heals.  It was a dificult time for me as I would have to gather every ounce of courage to step into that evil nest of gnolls and just as I would straighten my shoulders and work the tensions out of my arms with the swinging of my staff, new fighters would come crashing in around me and beg for heals with dire warnings given of a multitude of gnolls indiscriminately killing everyone in sight.  Chronchoker had entered the tunnel and watched me as I struggled to heal the others and heard my oft repeated wail of the inability I had to gather enough mana of life to heal all that needed healing.  I will never forget his generosity when he sold me the jewelry for the cash I had on me at the time, a few platinum pieces.<br><br>But that was really not the way this was to go.  For I was sitting there, just resting, relaxing and enjoying a few moments of idleness, when Sweepor, my friend a half dozen or better olser than I, dropped to his ankles and playfully knocked my book to one side.<br><br>"We are moving!  Come on!  Get Up!" He laughed as he bonked me on the head.  Naturally the thought of moving was not appealing to one such as I, I felt safe here!  But since he was going, there was little else I could do but leave with him.  The kindly priest in the temple comforted me in Qeynos, but he was never there beside me in the Burrows!  Stay and be forever alone or go and be with a friend in a strange place?  I make friends hard, so I had little choice.  When he said follow me, I did.<br><br>Please remember that to this point in my short life of ten seasons, I had only been in Qeynos, the Hills to the north, a few tremulous adventures into the depths of the Burrow, and one short jaunt to his homelands of Surefalls.  The only thing I knew of Western Karanas was that there was a werewolf that roamed frequently along the road near the Hills and he was something that could easily kill me.  My friend was always somewhere else with his older friends, and since I am not much of a boy of words, I never was with another that wanted to go to the Karanas.<br><br>Before we reached the Hills darkness descended all about us, (even today that seems to be the case whenever I need to travel, darkness of night or rain or both).  After a quick lesson, I learned how to follow him and still catch a glimpse of the strange and terrifying lands of Western Karanas.  Why was I terrified you ask?  Wasn't I with my friend and weren't both his other friends with us, all proven and well-armed?  Why did I not feel safe with a Lady Paladin, a mighty Warrior, and Sweepor a ranger?  It was not comforting to go down that narrow road in the dark and here Sweepor's reminiscing of his being caught by the werewolf right here and with all the corpses littering the area he might still be around.  It was not comforting that someone had cast on them some spell they called Spirit of Wolf, yet I had never even heard of that spell before.  No it was the most terrifying moment in my life when Bolaliel and Reiely disappeared in the darkness and I was left nearly alone with absolutely no idea where I was!  It was a mess trying to cross the Karanas, if I concentrated on using my new found skill at following, I would slam into a tree.  If I tried to avoid the trees, I would lose the ability to follow.  Not only did we eventually make it through Western Karanas, I then learned we needed to cross most of Northern Karanas.<br><br>Perhaps I hadn't studied enough geography in school, but I didn't know a Northern Karanas existed!  (I am glad Sweepor either didn't know of the Griffins or simply thought it best not to tell me about them.  If I knew then what I know now, I know I could never have made the run to a place called a druid ring.)  Nearly exhausted from the wild dash across this land of unknowns, I sat next to a tree.  I know it was a tree, I swear it!  But I also know I saw it moving and nothing like a tree that moves to the song of a mighty wind.  Jumping up I tried to find comfort with standing nearer my friends, but with a tree actually moving around, I heard a stranger say you have to 'group' with me for us to leave, and Sweepor warning that we needed to leave right now as danger was approaching from the northwest.<br><br>"Now Lal or we are all going to die!" Sweepor told me.  Now I had only 'grouped' with Sweepor a couple of times, three I think, and wasn't very adept at that simplest of functions, and I had spent most of my life all alone, so to speak.  Top that with a healthy portion of terror and I was nearly bawling trying to get it to work once again.<br><br>"Oh @#%^!"  Was the last thing I heard as suddenly the air seemed to split open around me, things that looked solid seemed to swirl all around me.  Yet nothing obscured that last sight I had as a bird-like creature screamed in furry right in front of me!<br><br>"Everybody ok?" Reiely laughed with unbridled excitement.  "That was close!"<br><br>"They said all we need to do is run east." Bolaliel said as he took off without further warning.  (If you get lost, just run east, you'll run right into Freeport, Sweepor told me.)<br><br>Thankfully I did manage to follow them, and as dawn began in front of me, I found myself 'bound' at the gates of a strange city.  Hardly had the dust settled when the other three decided they were going to the Oasis and all thought I should remain behind, being so young and all.<br><br>As I stood there and watched them go, I felt more alone than I had ever felt before.  Sure there were alot of people all around me but I felt utterly alone.  Orphaned apparently at birth, finding what solace I could find at the temple in Qeynos, at least I knew there which way was North. I knew I could kill a giant bat.  I could even kill a gnoll with my staff if I was careful enough.  When they disappeared, I had nothing to comfort me.  Was there even a temple in Freeport? Would Rodcife Nif know I was even here?<br><br>It was pitiful believe me.  I could get lost just going around a building.  Imagine my surprise when I 'zoned' and then had no idea where I was and couldn't even zone again.  To this day I have no idea how I got lost so quickly.  I guess I was the dumbest person in the world as I was so near the bank and actually going up to people and begging them for directions to the bank.<br><br>"Come on."  I turned at the sound of the voice.  It was the cleric, wise and mighty at 14 now, the one that had bound me at the gate.  I had seen him a couple of times in Qeynos and I admired him and his confidence.  Admired? No coveted!  He led me to the bank then slowly led me to the temple and then slowly took me to the entrance to West Freeport.<br><br>I heartfully thanked him for his patience and time.  Then a Lady gave me something, a pinkish gem.  She was a complete stranger to me.  I accepted the gift and thanked her for it, but didn't really appreciate what she had done.  It was just a gem, probably one she just didn't want anymore, though I certainly was poor enough that even a gold piece was cherished.  I stepped into the merchant's place of business and began to sell my bat wings, and rusty weapons, the last items from my adventures into the Hills and Burrow and was going to sell that gem too.<br><br>36 PLATINUM!  Good Praise what is this gem for?  So I quickly snatched it back from the eager grinning merchant and buried in deep in my Backpack.  I would never sell it!  To see who had given me this precious gem I questioned who all was in town at the time.  Standing near the bank were people 50 and near 60 seasons old!  The Lady who had given me the gem was 52 seasons old and a Priestess?  Though I diligently searched for her, and got lost more than a few times, I never did find her again to really express the gratitude I felt.  Surely I should give it back, and I would have tried, though I am sure she would have just laughed and sent me on my way.  It was her exceedingly great generousity that allowed me to purchase my 14th season spells.  I even now feel terrible that I cannot remember her name.  Though Damzing the cleric that bound me and led me around will never be forgotten.  Though Damzing isn't quite right I know if I ever see him again I will instantly know him...Damasing I think is closer. (Yes I did meet him many seasons later and his name I think is Damsing, I remembered to thank him again.  Funny how the past was so trivial to him, his deed so simple, he had no I idea why I was adament in my thanks.  He could not understand how his few brief minutes of caring had given me such great comfort.)  And Lady Priestess, should you ever read this, please accept my apology for not being so thankful that I should have been.  I tried for a long time to find you, but I could not.<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>

Though I wish I were as adept a stroyteller I may never succeed in bringing the life of a cleric to such realistic proportions as Shrikke has done with the Shadow Knight and another Cleric has done, I will try to give the gists of my simple life.<br><br>Of course, as others must have, I never knew of my Mother and Father, I was just there one day, standing in the streets of Qeynos with a note in one hand and a wooden club in the other.  Once the note was taken from my trembling fingers, my life became a blur.  My instructions were clear, memorize the first spell of healing and the first spell of protection, I was warned, then prove myself a value to the God of Life - Rodcef Nif.<br><br>A value?  It was hard and bitter.  Death? It was frequent.  Fortunately Rodcef found enough favor in me to bring me back time and again.  Flippy loved to chase me and some Queen of the Fire Beetles loved to clamp her pincers about me and cut my frail young body in two.  Yet I grew, I learned, I scribed more spells, and called upon Rodcef Nif frequently to stike the foes that swarmed the open entrance to my new home.<br><br>Yet my friend, a ranger, waited impatiently, till patience grew thin and he left to adventure in to the bowels of the evil hole called Black Burrow.  I envied him his courage and skill, yet fear held me close to the only place I knew.  Until the day I, following him closely begging for yet another adventurous tale, saw him disappear in the middle of the street.  Confusededly I stepped forward and saw the path littered with the remains of young people I had recently spoke with!  Looking to the North, I just caught the last glimpse of my friend going over the hill as a Gnoll suddenly roared and attacked me.<br><br>His laughter when I spoke of my first adventure injured me greaviously and spurred me to perhaps my most ill-fated decision.  Alone I adventured to the Maw of BLack Burrow.<br><br>The carnage!  There within the narrow dark confines of the tunnel sat many that yet bleed from wounds.  Bodies broken and crushed!  My heart ached and I called forth the power and beg to be allowed to heal these injured souls.  Rodcef, in his wisdom, allowed precious little healing, yet it was enough.  The people smiled, rose, then disappeared!  I sat to contemplate and meditate this phenomena that the God of Life had shown me.  Just as I seemed to have been refilled with his blessings, warriors, casters, and asundry of other folk suddenly tumbled and fell to the dust upon which I sat.  It was the same people that had just so very recently smiled and disappeared!  For three solid days this happened, healing with the power of Life, meditating, only to be once more covered with the blood of the returning fighters bewailing the fate of others less fortunate that has been over run by a great 'train' of gnolls.<br><br>Fortunately, one might say, there was a pause to the carnage and I stepped where others had tread and saw the great pit before me.  At my feet I lay many I could only mourn, already they being far beyond any power so far bestowed upon me.  A voice of a friend called to me and urged me to enter the home of the Gnolls itself, to pass through a door and meet at a small bridge.  I diligently and cautiously followed the right wall, memorizing every detail should I need to flee for my life. <br><br>I passed through the door, went up a slight rise, and was attacked instantly by some scrawny gnoll.  In terror I turned to run and screamed in fright as elite gnolls burst through the door.  Near mindless, I ran, my only desire to see the open plains of the hills, sunlight, green grass!  I stumbled and crashed into and through the gnolls, frantically trying to open the door as their weapons slashed and their fist pummeled me.  Miraculously I found the way to the pit!  I knew I was steps away from safety.  No not the first opening in the wall, into the tunnel!  Yet in my terror I missed the tunnel and stepped into ... I do not know!<br><br>I fell and landed with a splash in some water.  Gnolls laughed in their snarls as I frantically swam to the far side.  My last glimpse of life was through the water becoming pink with my own blood as Razorgills began to consume me alive.<br><br>The Rodcef, in his humorous ways, set me back up naked and bid me get my corpse.  I, scared to death, managed to make it back to the Burrow and even avoided the gnolls that spawned there (thank you again kind people for dispatching those that appeared so quickly and efficiently).  I searched for a pool, yet found none!  I peered over the lip of the hole and studied the water far below, could I have somehow fallen down there?  I shuddered in fear, that slight movement enough to loosen the stones under my feet and I pummulted downwards.  I had no time to scream in terror!  I sunk below the surface and saw many corpses.  None appeared to be my scrawny little hide, though I had precious few seconds to search as the Gills once more relished the taste of young human flesh!<br><br>I sat in the streets of Qeynos and wept bitterly. Gone forever was that fantastic staff given to me by my friend.  Gone indeed was everything.  Though I had had no armor to speak of, I had taken most of my few platinum pieces that most regretable day and I faced life without weapon, armor, food and drink, and less than a handful of copper pieces.<br><br>"What's the matter now?" Sweepor laughed.<br><br>"I have nothing!  That great and wonderous staff you gave me from deep below those vile tunnels is gone!"  I dreaded to tell him that!  How great a value that weapon must have been to have been acquired with such a risk!<br><br>"I'll get your old corpse!"<br><br>"No!" I protested.  Surely I could not stand his death on my foolishness too!  Yet I could not convince him otherwise.  I had to follow, then wait anxietously for word of his most certain demise amongst an ever growing crowd of injured fighters of good against these vile blood thirsty gnolls.<br><br>"There is no pool." I heard him say as I laid my book to one side.  "You must have fallen into the pit."  <br><br>"No! I made sure to stay far from the edge of the pit!"<br><br>He stood there, uncertainly then said he would check to make sure.  He returned to inform me what I knew already, only my naked corpse was within the waters of that pit.  "There is only one other place you might have gone." I saw him shudder.  "I will get your corpse with your permission."<br><br>I begged him not.  "Would my death be worth you indecision to consent my pulling your corpse?  For I am going now to get it."<br><br>However he managed to recover my corpse I can only imagine, but I know one thing for certainty: do not go anywhere near that great tree with its hewn doorway!</p>&nbsp;<br>A simple cleric of Rodcet Nif on Tholuxe Paells</td></td></tr>
