My mandate is to bring all of Norrath to heel and crush the opposition using guile, deceit, pestilence, agony, and Death.  When every land, Plane, and kingdom bows down in defeat before the God of Hate a new Age will begin and Darkness shall cover the earth.

The battle had been a terrible one and it was not over yet.<br><br>Another group appeared in the pass from the east.  Their armor was heavily dented and their shields were split.  They were covered with blood and sweat.  <br><br>&quot;The giants are too many for us,&quot; said one human warrior as he gasped for breath.  &quot;There are a great of our number fallen on the other side of the pass.  The giants chased everyone far into the pass before we escaped.&quot;<br><br>Gorfrey looked around at the dozens of wounded and realized he had run out of bandages.  I must do something, he thought.  Seeing a group of fellow dwarves getting ready to head back into the mountains, he decided to join them.  <br><br>When the party arrived on the other side of the mountain pass, Gorfrey was shocked to see a large number of slain humans, dwarves, and elves strewn all over the landscape.  There were even dead Iksar and ogres.  Such a fight, he said to himself.<br><br>Suddenly from up ahead an elf ran screaming towards him, pursued by three large hill giants.  The adventurers nearby immediately began to defend their wounded and the corpses of their friends by attacking the giants.<br><br>&quot;Brell, give me strength and make my aim true,&quot; Gorfrey whispered as he drew an arrow from his quiver and fixed it to his bow.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Gorfrey was irritated.&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey across the continent had been extremely difficult and he was physically and psychologically exhausted.  He had been beset by a group of female bandits in Western Karana and had to kill them all.  He had been attacked by griffawns twice on his journey and both times the nearby human guards would not help him.  Now on his way to Highhold Pass he had been attacked by a gnoll that had been raised from the dead by evil forces unknown.  <br><br>Standing over the dead (again) corpse of the gnoll, Gorfrey began to wish he had never made the journey to Qeynos in the first place.  He had certainly seen a lot of wondrous things, but the benefits of the trip so far seemed to be outweighed by all of the bad things that had happened. <br><br>Pocketing the dead gnoll's money, Gorfrey headed east towards Highhold Pass where he hoped to get some more water and perhaps a decent night's rest.  The humans there seemed a bit stand-offish with him but had warmed to him somewhat as he slew many of the orcs and gnolls that constantly attacked the human outpost.  <br><br>I should be home again in another week or so, he thought.  Faydwer.  Kaladim.  The dwarf picked up his pace as he entered the pass that led across the mountains.  He did not want to be caught in the plains of Karana at night.  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Apr 18 10:35:47 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Gorfrey took a long drink from his flask of water and then wiped off his bearded chin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hike across the mountains had been both tiring and dangerous.  After fighting off bandits and orcs near Highpass he had managed to make his way down the mountains to the enormous plains of Karana.  <br><br>In the distance he could see a settlement, with what looked like fields with crops and activity of some sort.  He made his way there to find a small community of humans.  They were not very friendly, but at least they were willing to trade with him.  <br><br>After buying more water and bandages, Gorfrey started towards the large bridge that he could see off to the west.  Between him and the bridge, there was something large hidden behind the trees.  He moved closer to investigate.  Suddenly he realized what it was. <br><br>A griffin! he thought.  A young one, but still very dangerous.  He began to back off to wait for it to move on, but the animal spotted him and moved to attack.  <br><br>Pulling out his two-handed bastard sword, the paladin quickly parried a blow but the griffin struck him anyway, gashing him across the head and shoulders with its large claws.  Gorfrey quickly counterattacked and delivered two quick blows that caused blood to spatter across the dirt road.  The griffawn continued its rapid attacks on him and began to wear him down.  Gorfrey continued to slash and thrust with his large sword but the griffawn was winning.<br><br>Undaunted, when it seemed Gorfrey was soon going to be killed, the dwarf said a short prayer to Brell.  Instantly the paladin was completely healed.  Suddenly facing a completely healthy opponent, the badly wounded griffawn began to retreat.  The young paladin pursued it and finally slew the beast just short of a fence next to a field of wheat.<br><br>Gorfrey turned to look at the idle human guard, who stood there slowly chewing on a stalk of grain and scratching himself in a private place.  <br><br>&quot;What kind of a guard are you?&quot; Gorfrey angrily asked.  &quot;Were you going to wait until it turned on you to do something?&quot;  <br><br>The guard looked at the dwarf with an expression of blissful ignorance and disdain.  His face and neck had turned a deep red from the sun. Spitting on the ground, the human turned and said &quot;Weeeyeell, you lived, didn't ye? So what are ye complainin' about?&quot;  The guard grinned to show off the few teeth he had left.  He then laughed in a strange manner that sounded like some strange animal.  &quot;Kyee-yuh, kyee-yuh, kyee-yuh, kyee-yuh.&quot;<br><br>Gorfrey stared at the human guard and blinked. he squinted to look more closely, making sure this wasn't some goblin trying to pass as a human.  No, it was a human, he realized.  At least technically.<br><br>Just then the wind shifted and Gorfrey got a whiff of the tall and dirty human.  Sweet Brell, the dwarf thought to himself.  Has he been rolling in manure?  Dwarves are not known for their cleanliness, but as a paladin Gorfrey was a bit atypical in his personal habits.  The human reeked worse than many of his fellow dwarves, the paladin thought.  He didn't think that was possible.  Why doesn't he take a bath?<br><br>Repressing his urge to throw the human in the river, the dwarf shook his head and continued towards the bridge.  He still had a long way to go to get to Qeynos and he was losing daylight.  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Apr 15 12:37:45 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Gorfrey stared at the lone sentry on the bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark elf apparently had no idea anyone was watching him.  He merely stood his post trying to stay awake.  <br><br>Boring night, my friend? Gorfrey thought to himself.  Well, it is about to get a lot more interesting.  <br><br>Drawing back a bladed arrow on his bow, Gorfrey aimed at the nodding sentry and let it go.  The arrow penetrated the elf's thin armor on his sleeve and stuck through the other side.<br><br>Shocked by the pain, the dark elf was fully awake now and turned to look for his attacker.  By now the dwarf was upon him.  Gorfrey slashed the elf deeply across the back and then again across his chest.  Blood spurted across the guard's tunic and began to soak his clothing.  In desperation he looked around for another guard to help him but there were none.  Struggling to parry the powerful blows of the dwarf, he staggered backwards away from the bridge and into the woods.  He realized he was dying.  <br><br>Gorfrey relentlessly pursued the staggering guard.  He clearly had an advantage as he was stronger and using a two-handed weapon against the weaker and wounded elf, who was using a one handed sword.  Finally Gorfrey slashed the dark elf guard across the neck, causing blood to spray widely across the ground and even across the dwarven paladin's face and shoulders.  His head almost severed, the elf blinked, tried to speak and then fell forward.  He stopped moving after a few seconds.  <br><br>Gorfrey wiped his bloody sword on the guard's tunic and said a brief prayer of thanks to Brell Serilis.<br><br>&quot;It is a shame that Innoruuk will not pity your soul, my friend,&quot; Gorfrey whispered.  &quot;But what do you expect from the god of hate?&quot;<br><br>Picking up the fallen guard's bronze sword, the paladin disappeared in the direction of the commonlands.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Apr  7 14:10:24 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The many human citizens of the town of Freeport began wondering about the high concentration of elves in the city just a little more slowly than they should have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given their recent alliance with the elves, they suspected no dupicity, and this was a near fatal mistake.  Seemingly overnight, elves of every discription were running in the streets, taking over inns, gem shops, merchant stalls, and as a final insult, taking an active role in the government.<br><br>Still, the humans acted surprised when the new governer of the city declared all humans to have a curfew of 8 PM, and that Elven be the new Spoken Tongue in the city.  The elves were many, and even those with strong ancestral hatred were clearly working together.  The monks of the city began to notice the odd emblems carried by many of the elves...  it was the symbol of Rallos Zek.<br><br>Now, Freeport is perhaps one of the most unique cities in all of Norrath, because here you can see dark elves and high elves, wood elves and dwarves, gnomes and barbarians, and even the occasional erudite and troll socializing together.  Nevertheless, there had always been the underlying tension between the inhabitants of the city and the darker races (specifically the Tier'Dal)...<br>&nbsp;<br>Icewind Novastorm<br>Koada Dal Cleric of Tunare<br>&lt;&lt;Mith Marr&gt;&gt;</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Gorfrey had just finished off a vicious deepwater crocodile when he noticed the deep rumbling sound coming from the west.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Oh no, he thought.  Is that what I think it is?  <br><br>A halfling came running over the hill as fast as his furry little feet would carry him.  &quot;Giant!&quot; he screamed.  &quot;Cazel is coming!&quot;  He sprinted past the small group of adventurers on the beach.<br><br>Gorfrey looked at his companions.  &quot;Run!  Head for that outcropping on the water!&quot;  The young dwarf took a running jump for the water, followed closely by his two friends.  <br><br>As they swam to the rocks, the rumbling sound grew much louder as the giant topped the dune in front of them.  Cazel was chasing a small group of adventurers who repeatedly hit him with their magic spells.  He was so intent on destroying them he did not see the smaller group on the column of rock in the pounding surf.<br><br>Gorfrey quickly drew an arrow on his bow and let it fly.  The arrow bounced off the giant's thick armor.  <br><br>Gorfrey's jaw dropped.  That had never happened before.  He drew another arrow and tried again, this time aiming for a spot of exposed skin.  The arrow flew true and hit the giant, who didn't even seem to notice him. <br><br>Gorfrey looked at Kinnan, his barbarian companion and shook his head.  &quot;Like a gnat on a bear.  It didn't even get his attention.&quot; <br><br>The large shaman laughed.  &quot;I think you need a bigger bow, my friend.  And bigger arrows.  Perhaps you should wait a few more seasons until you try to take down such a large foe.&quot;  <br><br>&quot;My spells had no effect either, young paladin,&quot; Ana giggled.  The beautiful high elf enchanter had also tried to slow down the giant to no avail.  Cazel had resisted every spell she had.<br><br>By this time the group of powerful and experienced adventurers had slain the mighty giant.  Gorfrey stared at the enormous corpse as the tiny adventurers looted its purse. <br><br>I can't believe it did absolutely nothing, Gorfrey thought with shock.  Although paladins were supposed to be humble, Gorfrey took great pride in his skill as a warrior.  This experience taught him a lesson.  He sighed.  He had a long way to go before he could take on such a mighty creature. Even longer before he could take it alone.  Yes, much more work I need, he thought.  <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2> It must be another one of those poor, mislead Druids again, I thought to myself as the portal subsided. My eyes began to clear, and what I saw amazed me, yet, scared me. Standing in the midst of the portal, were two figures. One, a Halfling. But this was no Druid. He weilded two giant swords, a waists length at the hilt, and as the blade went on, it got thinner and thinner, untill finally less than a needlepoint, with the Halfling tounge scribbled down the length of it. The Halfling himself even surprised me, he had the arms of a Dwarf, and a strong one at that. His hair brown as treebark, eyes a green colour. His face was in a great smile, as Halflings usually do. He also had the belly of a lazy, worthless Halfling. Yet, for some reason I felt that he was not worthless.<br>If the Halfling surprised me, the other thing made me wish I was lost in the coal mines with Cazic-thule chasing me! A great, dark figure that seemed to be staring deep, down into me, and through me, twisting my heart in the grasp of evil, melting away my courage. I began to fear that I had come across a Necromancer, cloaked in darkness.<br>&quot;Hail, we mean you no harm. But, may I please ask your name, rank and class?&quot;, the curious looking Halfling asked, with a sneer on his face.<br>&quot;Erm, well, fine. I am Carneyfolk, a Paladin of the 13th keg.&quot; I announced, gaining some of my courage back.<br>&quot;Heh, we found one without even looking.&quot;, proclaimed the Halfling, still with that sincere smile.<br>At that instant, I saw the dark form move over the Halfling, and engulf him in darkness, before moving over to me. The last thing I saw was a Halfling, laying on the ground. Not breathing.<br><br><br>The dark figure muttered but one word, as it pried the heart out of the dead Dwarf. &quot;Fools&quot;. The figure then dismissed the darkness flowing around and through it. And, in it's place, stood the Halfling that had been slain. He moved over to the body of his dead servant, and dispelled the illusion on him. In it's place, an Iksar Necromancer lay. He casually walked over to the Iksar, and took three empty bottles from the corpse, put the heart in a bottle, and began to whistle a merry tune as he made his way to Kaladim.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Mar 20 16:48:58 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>What?<br>When?<br>Why?<br>Who?<br>How?<br><br>Fools.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Pusbag had been sulking for days now.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of his kingdom and everything that represented weighed heavily on his mind, depressing him constantly through the days and weeks which followed his release from Gezz's enchantment.  All he had planned for, all those he plotted against, and all the time spent was wasted.<br><br>Once he made it back from the lair of the dragon Pusbag began to search for those he knew and cared about.  He hadn't seen hide nor hair of Samisen or Braag since his abduction and wondered where they were.   Finally, Pusbag had slunk around Grobb shrouded in invisibility only to discover his beloved city had been reduced to the ruins it had been when he gained control of the Troll's capital city years ago.  Totem had stripped everything of value from his citizens and ruled over them with a cruel and uncaring fist.  The Trolls wandering the streets seemed disconsolate and worn down, seemingly moving without any self-pride, purpose, or dignity.<br><br>At first it broke his heart to see his brother Trolls so listless and browbeaten, but as he continued his search around Grobb it became increasingly evident that Totem was strictly a figurehead for the Iksar.<br><br>The Iksar.  Pusbag's heart burned at the thought of those traitorous lizards who sought at every turn to undo him and his destiny.  As fury heated his emotions from depression to sullen rage his spirit began to rise with the formation of a new goal.  He would seek to destroy Usula and her cursed spawn, even at the cost of Evil's hold on Norrath.  He would purify the world of its' unworthy ilk and dedicate their souls to Innoruuk as he separated body from spirit.<br><br>Pusbag slipped into the armory and saw his personal armor sitting in a heap in a corner gathering dust.  He placed each piece on with care, delighting in how it formed to his body becoming a second skin.  The magical properties of the enchanted combat clothing rippled through his frame imbueing him with even more power than he already had.  Looking around he noticed the absence of his favorite weapon, his enchanted mace/scepter.  No doubt it was in the clutches of that vermin, Totem.  Pusbag made his way silently towards the throne room, passing by the guards as if he were a ghost.  <br><br>With a move made easy by years of practice under the tutalege of Angiisan, he casually snapped the necks of those charged with the task of protecting their king.  <br><br>Totem looked up at the sound of flesh smacking loudly on the cold floor of the throne room.  Seeing his guards dead in a pile made his green face pale...<br><br>Pusbag Infection<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Gnomoh Gnoless sat wearily on the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of his greying hair had been burned from his head.  Part of his right arm had been singed to the bone, and his body was covered with cuts and bruises from tumbling over rocks and ancient lava flows.  He had nearly lost his life impersonating the Iksar Gezz and guiding Pusbag into the Skyfire Mountains.<br><br>&quot;I can heal you Gnomoh, but, it will take time.  Tell me, how did you escape the dragon in the end?&quot;, Icewind asked as he carefully tended to the Gnome's wounds at his home in Felwithe.<br><br>Gnomoh looked at the healer with weary eyes,&quot;Color flux.&quot;, he stated plainly.  He paused for a few moments and continued.<br><br>&quot;Eldrig kept casting his various spells and I kept stunning him.  After what seemed like days of a stand off he withdrew a short distance and I was able to gate back to here.  I had only enough mana left for the gate spell, I was very fortunate indeed.&quot;,  Gnomoh shook his head as he relived his near fatal encounter with the dragon.<br><br>&quot;I do believe I gave Pusbag plenty of time to escape.  I told him he was free to seek his vengeance on the Iksar.  That part of the geas will remain; until the end of his days, Pusbag will be consumed with a burning hatred of the lizardmen.  Nothing else will matter to him.  He should be very good at it.&quot;<br><br>Icewind smiled at the thought of the enraged Pusbag killing all the Iksar he could find.  But, lurking near the surface of his thoughts, was a profound worry of what Dragonkind might do if the lay waste to the Iksar once again.  Would they stop there?  Icewind was afraid that the plan of the nations of Faydwer to turn Dragonkind agianst the Iksar might eventually bring Dragons back to Faydwer, where they once ruled long ago.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Usula waited patiently for the council members to gather at the Court of Pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had recent reports of greater activity in the Skyfire Mountains among the Dragonkind.  This, of course, posed serious threats to Iksar internal security, and should be addressed immediately.  Further reports from the Dreadlands were just as ominous.  With the activation of the old combine gate to the Nexus, her homeland was once more easily accessible by outsiders.  She feared what Mistmoor would do when his ally Sathir sent word of the increased dragon activity.  Her hope, if she could determine a proper course of action, would be to turn the two ancient foes against each other, and thus greatly strengthen the Iksar position on Norrath.  With no internal threats from Kunark, the Iksar could truly begin the rebuilding process.<br><br>When the leaders of the council arrived, Usula immediately briefed them on her information.  Strangely, she noted that the Hierophant seemed totally unsurprised, while the rest of the members were all in various states of disbelief.  Fortunately, over centuries of adversity, the Iksar learned to recover quickly, and after the brief shock of the announcement, the council members began @#%^ering out a plan.  Usula, not a member of the council herself, quietly departed to meet with Culris.<br><br>Her recent weeks had not allowed her to meet with Culris, but she was glad of this opportunity now.

The old sailor just shook his head and continued to unload supplies.<br><br>Wow, I like this place already, Gorfrey thought as he strode in.  The barkeep and the other patrons were all female elves.  And very attractive ones at that.<br><br>&quot;What can I get you, stranger?&quot; asked the beautiful young elf behind the bar.<br><br>&quot;Just some water, my lady.  By the way, would you happen to know where I can buy kiola nuts?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have them right here,&quot; she said with a barely suppressed smile.  &quot;How many do you want?&quot; <br><br>&quot;As many as I can carry.  They are for a friend,&quot; the young dwarf sheepishly replied.  He was not sure what to make of this charming and friendly beauty.  Well, she certainly is very pleasing to the eye.  There aren't any other dwarves around.  Who will know?  Gorfrey summoned up his courage before speaking again.<br><br>&quot;My name is Gorfrey.  May I have the pleasure of your name, my lady?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cleonae,&quot; the wood elf replied, somewhat taken aback.  She was clearly was not used to having any dwarves around, much less one that was so polite.  &quot;I have heard your name.  You fight the orcs, do you not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, my lady, I do.  The orcs have made a great many incursions into the Faydark.  I have been fighting them for some time.  It is my duty as a protector of Kaladim and a soldier of Brell.&quot;  Gorfrey cut himself off.  I must sound like a pompous fool, he thought.  He looked at his feet, suddenly conscious of how he looked.  Why am I such an idiot in front of females?<br><br>Cleonae eyed the young dwarf carefully.  This has to be the cleanest dwarf I have ever seen, she thought.  He almost looks... handsome?  <br><br>&quot;Well, I must be on my way now.  Brell guard thee, Cleonae.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And may Tunare guard thee, Gorfrey.  Fare thee well.&quot;<br><br>Stepping outside the tavern, Gorfrey started for the docks, realizing that the ship was going to leave soon.  While he was pulling on his pack, a voice from the darkness said &quot;Hand over that money pouch, dwarf, or I will have your life.&quot;  <br><br>Gorfrey pulled out his bastard sword.  &quot;Come get it,&quot; he shouted defiantly.  &quot;Or are you afraid to face me as a true warrior?&quot;<br><br>Angered by the insult, Zyle Bensmill lunged forward with his spear.  The paladin parried the thrust, then bashed the taller pirate with his shield.  Blood spurted from his lips.  Quickly casting a spell, Gorfrey blinded Zyle with a flash of light as he slashed him with his sword.  The pirate staggered backwards.  He clearly had underestimated this small dwarf.  Gorfrey continued to slash through the pirate's thin armor as he struggled to stay on his feet.  Zyle quickly realized he was in trouble, and began to stagger back into the woods.<br><br>Seeing his opportunity to finish his opponent, Gorfrey leaped upon the pirate and buried his sword in his back up to the hilt.  The pirate fell forward onto his face, completely lifeless.<br><br>Wiping his sword on the fallen pirate's clothing, Gorfrey said a short prayer for the pirate's soul.  He looked out at the docks and realized the ship had left.  <br><br>&quot;I guess I will be here a little longer.  Well, is this a sign, Brell?&quot; he asked with a mischievous grin.  Taking a golden earring from the dead pirate, he wandered back towards the tavern, hoping that Cleonae would like this gift.  At least he hadn't gotten any blood on it.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Mar  4 16:06:05 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey Bellhewer, 2ic Battlemaster<br>Paladin of the 31st Quest, Knights of Shining Light<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 13th Quest, Tain Shari<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The sun slowly rose above Fortress Talishan, spilling light into its courtyard. Standing up on the watchways, Eiczk watched young warriors practicing below. &quot;This lot will be lucky if one of them makes Footman.&quot; He thought aloud. Looking up he studied the rays of light pouring over the Fortress. He had risen early, as many things needed to be done. Papers to look over, reports to read, and at some point he had to go see Usula. He had begun to understand why Eator hated paperwork so much: It was downright boring, and never seems to end. The nightly reports that had come in by the time he rose were normal, quiet most everywhere, occasional skirmishes with the few remaining goblins and giants. Nothing really that new. However one report disturbed the warrior. News of Wurms stirring in the Skyfire Mountains. <br><br>A scout had reportedly seen an Iksar leading something up into the mountains. He had been following the trail of corpses that were left behind. Most unrecognizable, and they looked... chewed according to the scout. He had not followed the Iksar far to avoid entanglements with any of the locals. Shortly after loosing sight, sounds of combat were heard accompanied by the roaring of the Wurms. The scout fled the mountains with a few on his tail, trying to turn him into lizard stew. This lone Iksar was disturbing, something about it just wasn't right. Eiczk knew there were no soldiers sent on any missions up that way. Vek, Glox, and Xog had reported no approved incursions into the skyfire mountains by the council. He was not so sure about Glosk or Usula doing so. In fact he doubted the two would do this. He would of course still have to ask, but nicely this time. There would be no real reason for them to stir up the dragons, there would also be no reason to stir up either of the two after gaining so much. It was best to attack the Dragons in force, that way they had no time to group up. This stirring could present a nasty problem for New Sebilis. <br><br>He leaned over the railing, watching 3 soldiers escort another iksar in, dressed in a dark greyish leather, the garb the outpatrol was wearing. Eiczk did not recognize him though. He had ordered several legions to patrol the water around Kunark, and any unrecognized vessels were to be boarded, and sunk if not friendly. The Swiftails, Scaled Mystics, and the Brood of Kotiz had also sent detachments to aid in spellcasting and fighting. The members had been given either grey robes, or a greyish leather to help hide them as they swam. Several small boats trying to sneak in had been sunk so far. They had also put a nasty dent in the Elven fleet that still patroled nearby. Eiczk was pleased when reports told him of the boats moving further and further off the coast. They had a navy now, but small groups of Iksar making tactical strikes on lone boats was still a very effctive deterrant. <br><br>He turned to meet the entourage that had worked its way up to where he stood. The Trooper leading the escort addressed him. &quot;Sir, this is Xarnth of the outpatrol. He comes with news. He will not give his report, rank or business to anyone sir. Except to say that he must speak with you.&quot; Eiczk looked surprized. &quot;Well now, that does not bode well. Orders were for any on the outpatrol that if reports were to be given, they were to be given to their guild's commanding officer. Amongst the warriors that is Trooper Fryp. There are also Shaman, Monks and Necromancers assigned to the outpatrol. So which guild are you from, and why do you come to me?&quot; Xarnth cut his eyes to the Trooper that escorted him in. &quot;Trooper, give us a moment, but stay at hand if I call.&quot; The Trooper saluted, bowed, and walked partway down the stairs. &quot;First of all, regardless of what guild you are in, when you come to Fortress Talishan you give your name, and business when asked. If you are a warrior, you give your Name, rank and orders to be within the Fort. The guards challenge anyone who comes near for security reasons. Do not stray from this in the future. Now what is so urgent you have to speak directly with me? I have lots to do, and if this is not of the utmost importance, I will insure your Commander gives you plenty of reason not to violate the chain of command.&quot; <br><br>Eiczk stared at the Iksar, frowning angrily. He hoped the answers forthcoming would give him reason to report Xarnth. He hoped this because somewhere he knew inside this information meant more bad news. Leaning against the railing overlooking the Courtyard of the fortress, he waited.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Feb 28 02:02:10 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Eiczk Draygoner<br>35th rank Warrior<br>Legionnaire of Cabilis<br>Xegony<br><i>-Death comes to all, but for the fallen it shall come with a vengance.</i></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The gnomish necromancer stood at the front of the small boat. Thoughts of what would happen soon drifted through his head as he stared at the calm water leading to the land of Kurnak. The three other gnomes on the boat he had found at the oasis, and after explaining about his uncle's fate at the hands of the Iksar, they were eager to help in his attacks. Of course, the promise that they would split 100% of the profits gained in the venture helped a bit too.<br><br>The gnome dusted off his black robe, glowing runes shimmering slighty in the darkness. He nodded to himself as he thought of his newly found friends. Jan and Thenen, two brothers who claimed to had visited the far place of Odus and apparently obtained thier armor there. They both wielded swords of some sort. The last gnome never spoke besides to chant the prayers of his spells. The necromancer didnt know the name of the gnome or even particularily trust the guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they would do better than any Halfling or Human, they were determined and loyal to something more than coin, they were loyal to their ideals. They knew that the wrongs the Iksar had commited must be fixed.  <br><br>All of these thoughts went through the gnome's head as he boat slipped silently through the water. Jan and Thenen slept on the deck of the ship, snoring softly next to their packs. The young necromancer walked into the ship and was about to go to bed as the whole ship shuttered violently. He ran up the stairs to see Iksar on board the ship! Jan and Thenen had jumped up and donned their armor with extreme speed and most of the buckles and fastens were not done correctly. They stood back to back as the Iksar snarled and struck at them with odd shaped weapons. Mana began flowing from his fingertips as the gnome began casting the spell which had brought death to the orc a few days ago. Jan leapt forward and swung wildly at an Iksar, cleaving a long wound in its chest. The Iksar fell backward off the ship as it clutched at its wound. Another Iksar slashed with a sheer blade that neatly shattered Thenen's shield as he attempted to block the blow. An Iksar was suddenly surrounded with dark mana as the spell was completed and fell to its knees, in obvious pain as its skin seemed to bloat outward. Jan impaled the Iksar through the neck as it writhed in pain.<br><br>&quot;Wha- that spell was supposed to kill it! Why didn't it work?&quot;, the gnome necromancer exclaimed.<br>&quot;Who cares, lets finish these two off!&quot; Thenen said quickly.<br><br>As he turned his head back to the Iksar he hastily tryed to parry a blow from it's odd weapon yet failed as he was unaccustomed to its useage. His sword broke in half, and in a moment the Iksar had slashed thrice more, one at the legs, causing him to fall to his knees, then at the chest, blood split all over the ship as the final blow to the neck finished his existance on Norrath. Jan flew into a rage and swung wildly, fear, hate, and anger burning in his eyes as he fought the last two off. The gnomish cleric and necromancer casting thier spells behind him seemed to be an eternity away as he fought with strength he had not ever felt before. The Iksar sought to use this against the gnome as they stepped out of reach of the gnome's blade and knocked over two lanterns, setting the boat ablaze in the middle of the sea. They smiled fanged grins as they dove over the side of the burning ship, their mission accomplished. Jan feel to his knees, sobbing as he held his brother's body to his chest, blood staining his armor. The Necromancer ran to the side of this burning ship and shouted:<br><br>&quot;Iksar hear my words! You shall pay for your offenses against my people! You shall pay for my families loss! You will learn to fear the sound of my name! I Azuthe shall hunt down every last one of you and slay you where you stand!&quot;<br><br>The Burning ship began to sink as the gnomes frantically tryed to put the flames out.<br><br><br>Far out to sea the Iksar known as Xarnth looked to the other hunter to his left. Eiczk would need to hear about these gnomes, but they would not survive the night.<br><br>Azuthe (Name Pending) <br>Gnome Necromancer <br>Former 24th Circle of the Dark Arts<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Feb 27 23:02:58 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
