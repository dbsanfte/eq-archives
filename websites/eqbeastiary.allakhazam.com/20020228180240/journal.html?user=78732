	   <tr><td colspan=2>Of the Erudites<br><br><br>	The so-called &amp;#8216;high men&amp;#8217;, or Erudites have a most interesting past, ceded in the history of the human cities, but broadening out into something much larger.&nbsp;&nbsp;To set the stage, at this time, Odus was held tightly by the Kerrans, while on the newly renamed Antonica, the humans had built their first two great cities.  Freeport in the east, and Qeynos in the west.  Already Freeport had become corrupted by the arts of necromancy, which had come from Neriak, only a short journey to the north.  Qeynos on the other hand, remained dedicated to law and justice, under the rule of the Bayle family.  <br><br>	Inevitably, conflict entered the land, and humans fought themselves, as well as other races without them.  The fields were stained with blood, as new explorers returned from the human frontiers with incredible news.  Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, and magic flourished to the North (in Neriak) and to the west (in the Faydwer).  As the human cities were sent into more and bloodier turmoil with this news, a small group of intellectuals were becoming dissatisfied with the situation.  Lead by Erud, they desired to learn more about their new neighbors, and this mysterious magic power.  And so they did, one by one, they stole spells, guides, grimores and tomes from the great elven and gnomish libraries.  Finally, deciding that they had had enough of the constant strife in the great human cities, they prepared to set off for new lands.<br><br>	In secret, they gathered in Qeynos, and found passage to a small continent called Odus, where they could study in peace.  The new settlers called themselves Erudites, because Erud was their leader (as opposed to calling themselves Erudites, because Erudite is an adjective that means well learned and intelligent&amp;#8230;nice one there Verent).  Their spies continued to pilfer knowledge from Neriak, Felwithe and Ak&amp;#8217;anon as the Erudites set up their great city of stone.  There was just one problem.  The Kerrans, a sophisticated race of cat-men had already laid claim to Odus, and objected to the Erudite&amp;#8217;s demands that they leave to make way for the new (and arrogant) High Men.  But the Kerrans could do little to destroy the great new walled city of Erudin, so they were content to inhabit the southern portion of Odus, thinking the Erudites would leave them alone.<br><br>	Meanwhile, in Erudin, the Erudites were assimilating all the knowledge they could, and after some time, divided their magical castes in the same way the gnomes had done, and the elves long before both of them.  The high council banned (secretly) any study of Necromancy, not allowing those spells and tomes to be taken back to the city and studied.  But these measures were for naught&amp;#8230;Miragul, a powerful and well-respected member of Erudin society discovered these lost arts, and began studying them in secret, collecting a small following.  As his following and his knowledge grew, the Erudite High Council took note and made possibly the greatest mistake they had ever made: they declared war on all those who studied necromancy.<br><br>	The streets of Erudin went up in riots, as a great civil war began on Odus.  The newly branded Heretics fled from Erudin, and waged war in Toxulla forest.  The carnage was incredible, as the Erudites used nothing but magic to battle each other.  Miragul himself had left, and did not reappear on the scene of erudite history for many years; instead he escaped to Antonica and began to gather all the knowledge he could.<br><br>	The final battle of the Erudin Civil War was fought in the southern portion of Odus, and the Erudites succeeded in blasting the hole out of the ground, a massive pit, reaching down and touching the plane of underfoot itself.  The Kerrans who had coincidentally, inhabited this portion of Odus were transported somehow to Luclin, a hidden moon, far above the planet.  The Erudites fled back to Erudin again, afraid of the destruction they had wrought.  The heretics used the great pit and built their city of refuge, Paineel, on the sides of the hole.  It was not before long that they learned of their grave mistake, that they had touched the plane of underfoot (Brell Serilis).<br><br>	They tried their best to seal the breach, erecting a huge door between the floor of the hole and Brell&amp;#8217;s great plane.  But it was to no avail, rumor has it an over inquisitive gnome opened the door, another rumor has it that Master Yael broke it down personally.  Either way, the fact stands, the door fell.  Master Yael entered the Hole with a legion of his elemental troops on night, and slaughtered every single man, woman and child.  Only those above ground were safe, the upper city was saved.  The lower city was blocked off, to keep the monsters from rising again to finish the job.  The lower ruins of Paineel have become a staging ground of an elemental army, and a festering place of restless spirits, slaughtered in that bloody night.<br><br>	The success of Erudin and its inhabitants in uncovering the magical arts led to a backflow of knowledge across the crossing, to Qeynos, and then to Freeport, and the first human spell casters learned from the art of the Erudites.  Qeynos declared that all heretics were to be killed, but the Erudites freed their travel routes by using the long neglected sewers below the city.  Erudin and Paineel are at a silent war; too afraid of the destruction they caused to fight openly, but still hating one another deeply.  Erudin controls the only seaport, and has attempted to keep it as closed as possible.  One attempt to build a bridge across Erud&amp;#8217;s Crossing to Erudin from Qeynos to increase travel met with 3 quick assassinations of the project directors.<br>(Note, I will add information reguarding Miragul, and the Kerran's forced Exudos later)<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Naldiin Aredhel'istar<br>Magician, 52th Circle<br>&lt;Povar-Tarrew Artisiens&gt;<br>Xev Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Of the Erudites<br><br><br>	The so-called &amp;#8216;high men&amp;#8217;, or Erudites have a most interesting past, ceded in the history of the human cities, but broadening out into something much larger.&nbsp;&nbsp;To set the stage, at this time, Odus was held tightly by the Kerrans, while on the newly renamed Antonica, the humans had built their first two great cities.  Freeport in the east, and Qeynos in the west.  Already Freeport had become corrupted by the arts of necromancy, which had come from Neriak, only a short journey to the north.  Qeynos on the other hand, remained dedicated to law and justice, under the rule of the Bayle family.  <br><br>	Inevitably, conflict entered the land, and humans fought themselves, as well as other races without them.  The fields were stained with blood, as new explorers returned from the human frontiers with incredible news.  Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, and magic flourished to the North (in Neriak) and to the west (in the Faydwer).  As the human cities were sent into more and bloodier turmoil with this news, a small group of intellectuals were becoming dissatisfied with the situation.  Lead by Erud, they desired to learn more about their new neighbors, and this mysterious magic power.  And so they did, one by one, they stole spells, guides, grimores and tomes from the great elven and gnomish libraries.  Finally, deciding that they had had enough of the constant strife in the great human cities, they prepared to set off for new lands.<br><br>	In secret, they gathered in Qeynos, and found passage to a small continent called Odus, where they could study in peace.  The new settlers called themselves Erudites, because Erud was their leader (as opposed to calling themselves Erudites, because Erudite is an adjective that means well learned and intelligent&amp;#8230;nice one there Verent).  Their spies continued to pilfer knowledge from Neriak, Felwithe and Ak&amp;#8217;anon as the Erudites set up their great city of stone.  There was just one problem.  The Kerrans, a sophisticated race of cat-men had already laid claim to Odus, and objected to the Erudite&amp;#8217;s demands that they leave to make way for the new (and arrogant) High Men.  But the Kerrans could do little to destroy the great new walled city of Erudin, so they were content to inhabit the southern portion of Odus, thinking the Erudites would leave them alone.<br><br>	Meanwhile, in Erudin, the Erudites were assimilating all the knowledge they could, and after some time, divided their magical castes in the same way the gnomes had done, and the elves long before both of them.  The high council banned (secretly) any study of Necromancy, not allowing those spells and tomes to be taken back to the city and studied.  But these measures were for naught&amp;#8230;Miragul, a powerful and well-respected member of Erudin society discovered these lost arts, and began studying them in secret, collecting a small following.  As his following and his knowledge grew, the Erudite High Council took note and made possibly the greatest mistake they had ever made: they declared war on all those who studied necromancy.<br><br>	The streets of Erudin went up in riots, as a great civil war began on Odus.  The newly branded Heretics fled from Erudin, and waged war in Toxulla forest.  The carnage was incredible, as the Erudites used nothing but magic to battle each other.  Miragul himself had left, and did not reappear on the scene of erudite history for many years; instead he escaped to Antonica and began to gather all the knowledge he could.<br><br>	The final battle of the Erudin Civil War was fought in the southern portion of Odus, and the Erudites succeeded in blasting the hole out of the ground, a massive pit, reaching down and touching the plane of underfoot itself.  The Kerrans who had coincidentally, inhabited this portion of Odus were transported somehow to Luclin, a hidden moon, far above the planet.  The Erudites fled back to Erudin again, afraid of the destruction they had wrought.  The heretics used the great pit and built their city of refuge, Paineel, on the sides of the hole.  It was not before long that they learned of their grave mistake, that they had touched the plane of underfoot (Brell Serilis).<br><br>	They tried their best to seal the breach, erecting a huge door between the floor of the hole and Brell&amp;#8217;s great plane.  But it was to no avail, rumor has it an over inquisitive gnome opened the door, another rumor has it that Master Yael broke it down personally.  Either way, the fact stands, the door fell.  Master Yael entered the Hole with a legion of his elemental troops on night, and slaughtered every single man, woman and child.  Only those above ground were safe, the upper city was saved.  The lower city was blocked off, to keep the monsters from rising again to finish the job.  The lower ruins of Paineel have become a staging ground of an elemental army, and a festering place of restless spirits, slaughtered in that bloody night.<br><br>	The success of Erudin and its inhabitants in uncovering the magical arts led to a backflow of knowledge across the crossing, to Qeynos, and then to Freeport, and the first human spell casters learned from the art of the Erudites.  Qeynos declared that all heretics were to be killed, but the Erudites freed their travel routes by using the long neglected sewers below the city.  Erudin and Paineel are at a silent war; too afraid of the destruction they caused to fight openly, but still hating one another deeply.  Erudin controls the only seaport, and has attempted to keep it as closed as possible.  One attempt to build a bridge across Erud&amp;#8217;s Crossing to Erudin from Qeynos to increase travel met with 3 quick assassinations of the project directors.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Naldiin Aredhel'istar<br>Magician, 52th Circle<br>&lt;Povar-Tarrew Artisiens&gt;<br>Xev Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A Historical Essay on Basic Kunark Lore<br><br><br>Before the Empire:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shissir and the Green Death<br><br>	The first great empire upon Kunark was the Shissir.  A race of snake-men, they enslaved the entire continent as the dragons were organizing.  It is unknown if the trolls had been created yet, but I believe they only took form later.  The Iksar who now hold central Kunark were enslaved by the Shissir, who were more organized.  They used their Iksar slaves for labor and for food.<br><br>	The Shissir Empire rolled from Chelsith, the ruins of which now lie in the overthere, slowly rotting under the watch of scorpikie and the outpost of Venril Sathir.  The Shissir were an arrogant race, and explored the dark necromantic arts, much of which would later be unearthed by the Iksar and put to their uses.  Eventually the Iksar angered the gods, and it was decided they were to be eliminated.  Follows here, a text from &#8220;Before the Green&#8221; &#8211; from the library archives in Cabilis:<br><br>	&#8220;From it's green core the face of death begun to form. It was of no god they knew of. It opened its giant maw and spoke in tongues unknown. From the mouth of death rushed forth a green mist. The Shissar shaman began to cast spells in hopes of shielding their city and the necromancers began to assault the mist with great spells. All were futile. The mist rushed forth. The first snakes to be swallowed by the mist had their scales and flesh rot and fall from their bones. Horrid screams of suffering could be heard from within mist.&#8221;<br><br>This date sets the beginning of the Iksar calendar, at 0 B.G. (before green, referring to the mist).<br><br>	The Destruction of the Shissar was total, and left Kunark devoid of any ruling force.  Chaos followed with the froglocks, giants, dragons and the newly forged Iksar tribes fighting for resources and space.  <br><br><br><br>Tribal Rule: The Iksar Spread<br><br>	The Iksar spread out from the ruins of Chelsith outward across Kunark.  They formed into five tribes.  The Jarsath were a primitive, cannibalistic tribe whose ruined city of Varnek is located in the center of the lake of Ill Omen, sunken beneath.  An entrance to the ruins, also known as Veksar, has not been found to date.  The home of the Nathsar tribe seems to be the fortress at Chardok, but I only infer this because of items of their make seem to show there the most.  I am unaware where the Kylong or the Obulus tribes dwelt, and if anyone has information to this, please feel free to post it.  The Kunzar clan, the most important and powerful, ruled from the city of Charsis.  <br><br>	These tribes fought amongst each other, the froglocks, and perhaps the scorpikie.  I believe the scorpikie themselves were created by the Shissar, but they could have been products of Rile&#8217;s rule, and thus to come only later.<br><br><br><br>The Rise of the Kunzar, The United Iksar, and the foundation of the Sebilisan Empire<br><br>The mightiest of the Kunark Iksar clans was the Kunzar clan.  All that was needed was a strong, powerful and intelligent leader.  And this came in the form of Venril Sathir.  <br>Venril was a powerful warrior mage, dabbling in both battle and in magic, as well as an accomplished strategist.  He used his necromantic powers to summon an unrelenting army of undead to supplement his own formidable force of Iksar.  A native of Charsis he lead the Kunzar armies against the other four tribes, defeating them and placing them under his control.  AG 313, the Iksar Empire is forged under the banner of Venril Sathir.<br><br>	Sebilis, the new capitol of the united Iksar Empire, now renamed the Sebilisan Empire, is built in what is now called Trackanon&#8217;s Teeth.  Venril Sathir then enslaved the mountain giants, the froglocks and the forest giant, and enlisted them to build the great monuments across Kunark.  The slaves built great highly ornate gates and statues, to the point where now the ruins cover Kunark from north to south.  The two great military disciplines now form under Venril, the Crusaders of Greenmist (in reference to the Shissar killing fog) and the Court of Pain (weaponless warriors, now known as monks).<br><br>	Sathir grew old as his empire gained near complete dominance of Kunark.  He decided to cheat death by making a deal with Innoruuk to rise undead, unhindered by all things mortal, including death.  The great ritual was set up for the transfer of Sathir&#8217;s to immortality.  But the heir of the Sebilisan throne, Rile had different plans.  He broke the ritual, trapping Sathir&#8217;s soul in a gem, much as Miragul lost his own soul within a gem trapped within Permafrost Keep, which he hid.  He had the body cremated, and the remains can be found within Karnor&#8217;s Castle.  <br><br><br><br>The Sebilisan Empire beneath Rile and Atrebe: The war of Scale, and the End of the Empire<br><br>	Once his accomplished father was out of the way, Rile assumed command of the Sebilisan Empire.  I believe it was about this time the great City of Mist was constructed, but both Sathir&#8217;s and Atrebe&#8217;s reign could have suited the construction.  An article on the city of mist will follow shortly.  Rile was an extremely capable warrior in his own right, and was served by three great warlords, Kurn Machta, Karatukus and a vampire named Cosooth.  As a note, Kurn&#8217;s tower was named after Machta, something that should be obvious, but bears mentioning.<br><br>	Between the three great warlords and Rile&#8217;s own effort almost all of Kunark was most defiantly in the hands of the great Iksar Empire.  Several small groups of giants remained unconquered, and the Iksar had not begun their assault on the dragons of the Ring of Scale.  The threat to the dragons was obvious though, and the conflict seemed inevitable.  Thus the great dragons of Kunark called a conference.<br><br>	Thus the great dragon lords were brought together on how to deal with the Iksar.  Many of the younger dragons, lead by Trackanon, a blue poison dragon, advocated swift destruction.  But in the end patience prevailed, and it was decided to only steer events from afar, and not wage war directly.  <br><br>	Trackanon disagreed with this decision and decided, with some of his younger supporters to act decisively.  In the year 406AG, they attacked an Iksar fleet (with the captain Vlsk Irontail and Emperor Rile aboard) and destroyed it.  For the next 50 years the Ring of Scale and the Sebilisan Empire.  As Rile was already dead, his son Atrebe took control.<br><br>	Atrebe was not a warrior like his father, but instead of a necromantic bent, and went to creating new armies for the Iksar, much as the Shissar had many ages before.  To augment his ground forces, he created the Sarnak, half Iksar, half dragon.  These Sarnak have become a powerful force and have branched into a more magical and studious group named after their father, the Kly (residents of Danlir).  He also created the Sokokar, a froglock and dragon pair as flying mounts for his troops.  I have never seen one of these beasts, but if there were evidence of any still existing, I would love to be told of it.<br><br>	The battle raged and with their new beasts and weapons the Iksar began to make advances against the dragons, but the battles were bloody.  Atrebe passed away, and his son, Ganak, much more like Rile in his warrior ways, took over.  Above the Field of Bone was waged the greatest battle of the war, in which both the leader of the Ring of Scale (Jaled-Dar) and Ganak were killed in battle.  The battle itself in a draw, but not before a final raid on Sebilis in which the dragons took out the imperial palace and the final brood of the emperor, eliminating his line forever.<br><br><br><br>The Emerald Circle, and the fall of the Iksar<br><br>	Without an emperor, a new leader had to be selected.  Instead of yet another emperor and more years of dynastic rule, the Iksar selected to create the Emerald Circle.  Made up of five lords, each from the original tribal states, they attempted to increase the power of the Iksar, without having it destroyed at the hands Ring of Scale, who was now rebuilding and meddling in all affairs on Kunark.  During this time, the City of Mist prospered, and the Iksar slowly began to rebuild.<br><br>	The council dissolved into the original five tribes as they bickered.  Then even these tribes began warring on each other.  The Ring of Scale pits each leader against the next, just as they had planned to at the beginning.<br><br>	With the weakened power of the Iksar, the slaves in Sebilis saw their time to revolt.  The giants began sacking the outposts, and the blood-gill goblins invaded from Faydwer, and have by now set their bases around and in the Lake of Ill Omen.  According to one diary entry recovered from the city of mist the castle there was attacked, rumored to be by froglocks lead by a dragon (possibly Trackanon).  The City of Mist was reduced to ghosts as the Iksar fled the cities to escape the onslaught.  The Dragons finally decimated the cities, and Trackanon himself settled down in the ruins of the once great city of Sebilis.<br><br>	The Iksar Empire was no more.  The goblins, new to the continent began to build tunnels similar to their homes.  The Sarnak seized control of Chardok and a Jarsath fortress near the Lake of Ill Omen.  The undead seized the City of Mist, and the froglock and servants to Trackanon took over old Sebilis.  Kurn&#8217;s tower was inhabited by Buryani and undead.  The Iksar themselves hid for an extremely long time.  Only one great action is recorded before I find records of Cabilis having been founded.  The Crusaders of Greenmist, their remnants, made one final crusade, fighting across the Overthere, the Dreadlands and through Karnor, dislodging a tribe of Goblins.  They turned to where Cabilis is now, then occupied by more Goblins, but an evil pact gone bad destroyed the great army before it reached Cabilis.<br><br>	Kunark was ruined and war torn.  The Trolls rose and fled from the now burned out continent.  The froglock did seize the swamps, and strange creatures moved into the Emerald Jungle.<br><br>	The Lands of the Iksar were destroyed.  That is all for now.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Naldiin Aredhel'istar<br>Magician, 52th Circle<br>&lt;Povar-Tarrew Artisiens&gt;<br>Xev Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>An open letter to the Scholarly Naldiin Aredhel'istar,<br>Sir:<br><br>I find your writings in stark contrast to the teachings expounded by the clerics of Tunare, and will point to two specific instances.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage and enjoy an honest response to my observations, and pray that you do not take this post as a flame.<br><br>1)  The clerics of Tunare teach that Innoruuk was not the original god of the Elves, but that Tunare, the Mother, was the first god of the elves.  I would refer you to the (ooc starter kit) legend of the first king and queen, and the jealousy of Innoruuk at Tunare's perfect creations.  I would further suggest that your theory on the war between the elves is in error due to the idea that Dark Elves would ever come to the aid of a Dwarf.  I have never seen this happen, though admittedly, my knowledge is a bit limited in this regard.<br><br>2)  You state that "as a Dragon is to an Elf, so is Veeshan to the greater gods, such as Tunare.."  On what grounds do you base this assumption?  Do you have evidence that suggests Veeshan even still exists, and that through this existance, she can overpower the gods of Norrath?  I have walked the mountains of skyfire, and I have seen the dread wurms;  I know I would never stand a chance against one of those beasts, and yet, I know that I am not consumed or threatened by them.<br><br>In your response, most noble sir, I would like you to refer me to the locations of the libraries and vendors of lore that you have quoted.  I can easily travel the continents of Norrath, with the assistance of wizardly friends, so I have no worry over the distance needed in order to collect these writings.<br><br>Most humbly yours,<br>&nbsp;<br>Icewind Novastorm<br>Koada Dal Cleric of Tunare<br>&lt;&lt;Mith Marr&gt;&gt;</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To the scholarly fellow, Naldin Aredhel'istar,<br><br>I am most gratified that you did not take offence to my post, and even more gratified that you would supply me with answers to my observations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can continue, however, I would like to continue this discussion.<br><br>As to your first response, I would simply say that there are a great many sites with a great many stories, but these stories are not necessarily true.  I was asking more for evidence to support your argument from within Norrath (or from without from a credible source such as Sony or Verant, no offence intended to Allakhazam).  If our records in the marble halls of Felwithe are in error, I would like to know; but if, as I suspect, the records are correct and your story is wrong, I would like that to be brought fourth.<br><br>As to your second point, I would not deny, even in mad ravings, that Veeshan is not a powerful god.  I merely question your statement that Veeshan is greater than the Mother of the Elves.  Certainly you would agree that Brownies, as an example, are much smaller than giant spiders.  Yet, I doubt even the drachnids could stand against a simple brownie outcast.  My point is simply that size is not an acceptable measure of power.  You site Veeshan's claws as an example of the god's power, and I acknowledge that it is so.  I would site to you, however, the forest growth, the unicorns of the lesser faydark, and yes, even the elven people, as an example of the power of Tunare.  Who can say which is the greater?<br>&nbsp;<br>Icewind Novastorm<br>Koada Dal Cleric of Tunare<br>&lt;&lt;Mith Marr&gt;&gt;</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>IN response to Tochail the Sage,<br><br>The "War of the Broken Crown" was distributed pre-beta.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is from Verent.  The source stands as reliable.  Please, do go and read it.<br><br>     In referance to the information in the halls of Felwithe.  The elves first did follow tunare, but were twisted from her, for as the king is, so is the nation.  At the time of the empire, the elves followed Innoruuk.  As stated by the Verent issued writings.<br><br>  And while a brownie outcast may be able to tangle with a drachnid, these are the exceptions to the rule.  The power of Tunare is in the unicorn, and the farie.  The power of Veeshan is in the dragons, the greatest of beings on Norrath, short of Mayong Mistmoore (that point can be argued).<br><br>  To truly get a size comparisen, a brownie outcast attempting Vox would be a much better comparisen.  Tunare is great, that is true, but Veeshan is the greater.  Simply by her immense size (think as big as Norrath) she could overwhelm the other dieties.  <br><br>To quote everquest.com;<br>"Veeshan is the great crystalline dragon who rules the Plane of Sky. She needs no allies but considers Brell Serilis an enemy"<br><br>To need no allies, means that you are the strongest one out there.  Consider this, if all the dragons were to mobalize to one point, all the wyvrns, drakes, true-dragons, and thier servents, what would remain?  The Storm Giants can hold only a single faction of dragons.  The Iksar empire was decimated by a second.(There are three known groups of Dragons, The greatest is the Claws of Veeshan, the original brood, then the RIng of Scale, and finally the union of Vox and Nagafen, which could be spread to unclude the sleeping Kerafrym, with all his insanity)<br><br>And Kerafrym, the ultimate dragon (but still under Veeshan) can overpower any force of Norrath.  If these lesser imiatitions of Veeshan herself are any indication, Veeshan has power beyond anyones wildest dreams.<br><br>The greatest creation of Tunare was the elves, yet both Kelethin and Felwithe would serve for little more than kindaling had the ring of scale not been parried by the Vampire Mistmoore (pre-Kunark Gm events made this abundantly clear--Venril Sather and Mayong Mistmoore both work activly against the dragons of kunark...)<br><br>And, as for Tunare's might, Woushi, a single true dragon, seems to hold her own within the Wakening Lands, the most sacred of Tunare's forests.  The Giants and the Dragons activly wage war accross tunare's forest, meaning that it cannot impede them.(THis is fact.  The dragons do hold thier own in the Wakening lands, with Woushi hunting Giants, and giants attempting to kill Woushi, seemingly ignorant of the powers of the forest)<br><br>And, to make the dominance of the Cystalline Dragon complete, Tunare is not even as large as one of Veeshan's single talons.  (this can be determined by sizing Tunare against the giant gashes in Velious)<br><br>That is All<br>&nbsp;<br>Naldiin Aredhel'istar<br>Magician, 52th Circle<br>&lt;Povar-Tarrew Artisiens&gt;<br>Xev Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Most noble scholar Naldiin Aredhel'istar:<br><br>I thank you for the clarifications you made in regards to the history of the elven people, and will gladly be doing some more research of my own into the matter.<br><br>As for your conclusions of Veeshan, I would offer only one small observation.&nbsp;&nbsp;IF Veeshan is so much greater than the Combined might of the gods, why does she not simply destroy Brell Serilis, if she considers him an enemy?  It would seem to me that if a dragon does not like you, it tends to attack, and as you have observed (though I paraphrase) the created are a reflection of the creator.  I would again caution you against assuming that size makes any difference in power, especially when it comes to considering the ways of the gods.<br><br>On an altogether different topic, I am curious about the histories of the Iksar empire.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>My view, the Kunark project, and Veeshan<br> A work on Kunark would be very extensive, and most liekly done in multiple peices.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it is next on my list.  After Kunark is Miragul, and, more genrally, the Heretic wars.<br><br>  The pact Brell made with the other gods was secret, for a reason.  It seems that gods cannot enter eachother's planes.  During the corruption of the Lesser Faydark, Cazic Thule, using trechery, temperarly defeated TUnare, i think if he could have, he would have continued into the plane of growth.<br><br>   Also, it might well be that Veeshan just doesn't fit.  <br><br>But, the most likely reason, they are immortal.  Innoruuk never directly assults Tunare, just curtails her interests.  Rallos Zek angered all the gods, and all they did was seal his plane, not kill him, not disinhereit, no power stripping...etc.<br><br>The combined might of the gods will parry her, but, if you cheak your manual, it took most of the gods, working together to stand a chance against her Children.<br><br>I would also venture that Rallos Zek is the next strongest, as the giants rank number 2 in Norrath.  THis is only a guess, i cannot confirm, but His avatar was more powerful than many of the gods individually.<br><br>That is all for now.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Naldiin Aredhel'istar<br>Magician, 52th Circle<br>&lt;Povar-Tarrew Artisiens&gt;<br>Xev Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>My Historical Findings on The War of the Broken Crown<br><br>While now it is taken for granted that the elves are split distintly into three different groups, there was a time when all the elves were united a single empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;The collective elves called themselves the Dal, wiht the wood elves being considered wild elves, living on the fringes of the empire.<br><br>The Elven Empire was massive, from the Elven Capital of Caerthiel in the loping planes to the fair elven city of Takish-Hiz, is what is now the Desert of Ro.  At that time though, it was not a Desert, it was the great Elddar Forest.<br><br>On Ranthok's ridge, the nation of ogres lived, still shacken from the fall of Rallos Zek.  In the Butcher Block Mountains the Dwarves of Kaladim held a small nation as well.  Both of these peoples lived in the shadow of the Elves, whose empire was many times more powerful than thiers.<br><br>But the peace could not last forever.<br><br>Causes of the War of the Broken Crown:<br><br>Many of the Elves had grown sick of the corruption within the Empire.  They become distrustful of Innoruuk, attacking all that signified him.  They turned instead to Tunare, the goddess of growth, and the mother of the elves.  This was blasphemy to the Loyalist Elves who still followed Innoruuk.<br><br>It is unknown to this scholar if the slow destruction of the Elven city of Takish-Hiz also contributed to the war, but i would guess that it did.  AS Solusek Ro grew angry with the Elves, he detoryed thier city on the continent of Tunaria (now Antonica).  This would have created a need for the elves, to move, and the loyalist Capital of Caerthiel sat on the continent that was the next logical choice.  Add this to the growing distontent, and the tension was ripe for war.<br><br>The Rebelious elves first attacked Wielle,an Elven outpost where Freeport now stands, North of the resting place of the then dieing city of Takish-Hiz.  The loyalists within the outpost were killed.  This action brought on a war that lasted for years upon years, as both sides recruited those undecided to help them with thier fight.<br><br>The Ogres, in a rare moment of brilliance, choose this time to attack the dwarves of Kaladin.  Because the Elves could not lend aid to thier short allies, the ogres could give battle without fear of the powerful Elven armies decending upon them.  This also took the Dwarves out of the War of the Broken Crown, ensuring that thier alliance with the loyalists would mean nothing in the coming conflict.<br><br>The Deciding Battle: Aerignon<br><br>At Aerginon, the loyalist armies finally encircled the rebel armies near what is now Felwithe.  The rebels were trapped and unable to effectivly fight the coming onslaught.  The Emporer himself came from Caerthiel to the field of battle to direct his victory personally.<br><br>But what was about to become a crushing defeat for the forces of rebellion soon became a turn around victory.  The wood elves (then called wild elves) attacked the Loyalist forces from outside, pinning them between the Rebels inside the trap, and the wild elves outside it.  The emporer was killed by an assasin's dagger, and the armies of Caerthiel were forced into a route after a long and bloody battle.<br><br>After a few more years of fighting it became clear that without the Emporer the loyalists had no chance to defeat the Rebels.  The Rebel armies pushed the loyalists back to thier Capital of Caerthiel, and that night prepared to raze it to the ground.  During the night, a priest of Innoruuk led the people within Caerthiel, along with much of thier knowledge, through a great hole in the earth, and into the darkness.  Mayong Mistmoore and his servents seem to be the only Innoruuk worshiping (at that time) forces to stay on Faydwer, most likely protected by Mayong's powerful magic.<br><br>The Rebels charged the city, only to find that all the loyalists had escaped through unknown means.  The Rebels razed Caerthiel to the ground, and much of the glory of the Elven Empire went with it.  Without the aristocracy and leadership that the Empire had had before the war, it collapsed.<br><br>Aftermath<br><br>The once unified race of Elves was now split in three, with the newly named Dark Elves hating the other two.<br><br>The Rebels set up thier city of Felwithe on the spot at which the Emporer had died.  They declared themselves the High Elves or Koada'Dal.  The Wild Elves established themselves only a short distance away, in the treetop city of Kelethin, and they became known as the wood elves or Fier'Dal.  Both the High Elves and the Wood Elves took Tunare as thier main god.<br><br>For the loyalists, the patth from Caethiel was long, and the time in little or no light gave them enchanced night vision, and darknend thier skin.  When they finaly did reach the surface again, they created the fortress city of Neriak, under the earth of the Nekulatos Forest.  They spent thier time plotting to restore the empire they had lost and defeat the Elves that had forced them from thier homes.  They are called Dark Elves, or Tier'Dal, because of the color of thier skin.<br><br>IN the End, two great cities lay in rubble, Takish-Hiz had succumb to Solusek Ro, and Caerthiel had been annihalted by the High Elves.  Three new cities stood, none of which were as glorious as the great cities of the past.  The marble towers of Felwithe, the treetop platforms of Kelethin, and the underground metrapolis of Neriak.<br><br>In the end, the greatest change, was the once unified Elven Race, became a race at war with itself.<br><br>That is all.<br>&nbsp;<br>Naldiin Aredhel'istar<br>Magician, 52th Circle<br>&lt;Povar-Tarrew Artisiens&gt;<br>Xev Server</td></tr>

The location of his castle (The lesser Faydark) leads me to beleive that he lived (in the more traditional sense) before the break of the elven empire.  The great capital city of the elves was located then in the hills of shade, it was called Caerthiel.<br><br>A vampire's power increases exponetially as they age, and thus it is with Mayong.  He must have been a powerful spell caster in his life because he sems to have been the only living being able to keep his mind after transforming into the un-life.  Venril Sathir was thwarted by his son, and required the assistance of a god, and Miragul tried it alone, and failed.  Mayong is older than both of these creatures.  MUCH older.  Miragul made notes of Mayong's minions while he was still in erudin (one of the librarians there has a small scrap of Miragul's journal, for a small price.)<br><br>Mistmoore's power extends too every corner of Norrath.  He has cut much of the travel in Kunark to peices by heavy use of Drachnids.  Drachnids are half dark elves, half spiders, another foul experiment of Mayong's.  The drachnid's are based out of the Dreadlands, but have also set a practical siege upon the compound at Firiona Vie, all at the bidding of Mistmoore.  The ocean of tears also bears his mark, as a small contigent of his gragoyles.<br><br>Mayong Mistmoore's greatest power is located within his castle, which he is hardly ever present.  The entire grounds and castle are packed with creatures in thrall to the Vampire lord.  These include living well armed dark elves who bow before Mistmoore, as well as lesser vampiric servents.  Also full mindless undead (damphryes, will-sappers, etc) dwell within his castle, and a pack of blood wolves below it.  A renegade shadowed man is either held by spell or seeks asilum within the Castle, and will not attack anyone unless you have angered the Temple of Ro (he is renegade against his fellow shadowed men).  The scarecrows and Jack-o-lanterns in Unrest and the planes of Karana were created by a long dead minion of Mistmoore, as recorded in Miragul's journel.<br><br>The castle itself is a major obstacle in challenging Mistmoore.  Hidden within the Lesser Faydark, it is hard to assail due to the army of dark elves who dwell there, and it's position ontop a steep crag and over a narrow bridge.  It isn't a long jump of logic to say that the High elves and Wood Elves launched assalts upon it as they set up thier own cities, seeing as how Mistmoore is the effective simbol of everything they hate<br><br>Mistmoore himself does not follow any god.  He helped to defeat Lanys T'vl after she was disowned by Innoruuk, and complete Malevolence, but he does not follow Innoruuk.  He did not interfere when Cazic Thule took temporary control of the lesser faydark.  He did directly oppose the Ring of Scale, and by assosiation, Veeshan herself (as a Dragon is to an Elf, so is Veeshan to the greater gods, such as Tunare, Bertoxxulos, or Thule...).  This leads me to beleive that Mistmoore has nearly godlike powers on his own, otherwise he would have been smashed.<br><br>It is unknown his relationship with Miragul, although both knew of eachother.  It is similarly unknow how he treats with Venril Sathir, although i would assume decent relations, the castle in the dreadlands (Karnor's) is in Venril's hands, and the Drachnids in the Dreadlands seem to protect it.<br><br>Mistmoore opposes the joint Bard guilds, although the grivence is not known to this scholar (if you know, post it).<br><br>That is all.<br>&nbsp;<br>Naldiin Aredhel'istar<br>Magician, 52th Circle<br>&lt;Povar-Tarrew Artisiens&gt;<br>Xev Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>(This is under re-editing, just so that you know, and will be reposted above under the Kunark Thread)<br><br>My observations reguardling the inhabitants of the Crypt of Danlir...<br><br>As is well known, many creatures in what was the Crypt of Danlir, but could now be described more as the laboratory of the Kly, are unique in that place in Norrath.<br><br>The history behind the Crypt is not long.&nbsp;&nbsp;Danlir was a rich Iksar noble, who wished a secert burial when he died.  This the first several sets of tunnels were dug, he died, and was burried there.<br><br>This is infrence, but i belive that a group of Sarnak, under relegious or scientific motivations (either they couldn't preform thier FOUL experiments, or they couldn't practice thier relegion...) broke from the main Sarnak collective.  I say relegious, because many of the greater Kly are refered to rank-wise by what appears to be faith status (believer, follower, etc).<br><br>They 'set up shop' at the lowest levels...and began digging new caves.  Well adapt at mind control and coercion, they captured, instead of killed most of those that entered the crypt, creating an army of mindless minions.  Gnomes, Erudites, Tier'dal, and Iksar have all been seen there.  Oddly, although evidenced by the precense of thier heads in preservation jars, the froglocks have not been 'coerced' into joining the ranks of the Kly...but just killed instead.<br><br>The leader of the Kly, is simply named 'The Kly'.  (ooc: something like the Minoans, named because thier kings were all called Minos, which is now stipulated, is thier word for "king").  His room is adorned with two fine wooden shelf/cases with books and scrolls, presumably of research, and the already-mentioned froglock heads, (perhaps FOR experiments).<br><br>It is entirely possible that all the creatures in the crypt were created by the Kly to defend themselves.  The Kly look exactly like thier Sarnak brethern and on rare occasions (read: Gm event) have been known too help the Sarnak collective in battle.<br><br>That is all.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Naldiin Aredhel'istar<br>Magician, 52th Circle<br>&lt;Povar-Tarrew Artisiens&gt;<br>Xev Server</td></tr>
