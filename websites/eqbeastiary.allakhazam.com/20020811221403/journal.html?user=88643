It takes one of noble character, unable to refuse a cry for help, jumping into the frey without concern for his/her own life or limb. Kaldolur Britebeard has received such a calling. 
He travels the length and bredth of the world, doing good wherever he can. He only seeks out those who know (and show) the meaning of words such as honor, respect and courage, to travel with. He refuses to associate with or do business with those who exhibit the disgusting qualities of greed, rudeness and cowardice.
Although he has completed many quests in his journeys, he remains on one quest inparticular that he seldom speaks about. Many years ago, during the infamous Dwarven-Goblin Wars, Kal was seperated from his wife and children. He returned from the wars to find their humble home in Kaladim a blackened and smoking hull. There has been no evidence come to light to indicate that his wife (whom he affectionately calls 'Dinkie') and his children are still alive, but Kaldolur is not without hope. He prays that someday they will be reunited once again, even if it takes his entire life.
Until that day comes, keep an eye out for a stout, yet short, dwarven paladin in brilliant plate armor fighting valiantly and helping wherever he is able. And don't worry about that perpetual scowl that creases his brow. If you greet him politely in friendship, you may just win a friend for life.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I stood poised, ready to attack, for what seemed like hours, unable to move. I was stunned at the sight before me... struggling with what I knew in my heart to be right, and what was considered 'acceptable' by my order....<br><br> * * * * *<br><br>&quot;Good Paladin, can you help my friend?&quot; the petite woodelf had asked with a concerned look. She was a pretty, young thing (as elves go), and her deep brown eyes reflected her genuine heart.<br><br>Sitting in my favorite booth in &quot;The Drunken Swine&quot;, I looked up from my mug of ale and raised a skeptical eyebrow. I could tell she was a druid by her earthen choice of clothes and armor.<br><br>&quot;He was trying to recover the knowledge of an ancient spell,&quot; she continued, &quot;but has been hindered by a powerful skeleton that protects it.&quot;<br><br>My ears perked up at the mention of undead... my specialty. And who was I to refuse a cry for help? I pursed my lips and gave a &quot;forced&quot; reluctant nod (so as not to seem too eager), and downed the rest of my ale. I stretched, arching my back and slid out of the booth.<br><br>&quot;Stand close to me, Sir Dwarf, and I shall call upon Tunare to take us to my friend's side...&quot;<br><br>She took a step forward to place herself toe-to-toe with me... almost too close, and smiled at my discomfort. She moved her arms in languid curves around her body and I felt a cascade of tingles across my skin as she wove her transportation spell. There was a sudden rush of wind and a flash of light, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing in a mist-laden jungle.<br><br>She smiled again, this time with a hint of pleasure in her eyes and motioned for me to follow her.<br><br>The jungle was teeming with all sorts of sounds... very alive. The massive trees loomed like giants on every side. The druid obviously knew where she was going, so I followed her - occasionally catching glimpses of the wild creatures that inhabited this place.<br><br>After several minutes, she stopped and stood still. Although I could detect no change in our surroundings, it seemed as if we had arrived at our destination. She put her fingers to her lips and let out a high-pitched &quot;trill&quot;. The sound was returned almost immediately.<br><br>&quot;He's here,&quot; she stated matter-of-factly.<br><br>We moved in the direction of the return whistle and suddenly a massive stone edifice rose out of the mists, very much in need of repair. &quot;Naturally,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;because it wasn't constructed by dwarven masons!&quot; (That much was obvious.)<br><br>A male voice, slightly accented (I couldn't quite place it), broke through the fog...<br><br>&quot;Ah, I see you have brought assistance...&quot;<br><br>The mists parted, and out from behind a huge, broken pillar stepped a -<br><br>&quot;DARK ELF!&quot; I spat. My hands went easily to the axe strapped on my back. In one smooth motion, I pulled the druid behind me and gripped my weapon in front of me in a battle-ready stance.<br><br>A cool hand touched my shoulder and the druid's soft, almost musical voice spoke.<br><br>&quot;Wait!&quot; she pleaded, &quot;He is my friend!&quot;<br><br>This statement stunned me more than if it had been an ogre's maul. Racial tensions had been the cause of many a bloody battle between the elves and the Tier'Dal. The dark ones were hated throughout all of Norrath for their evil ways and commitment to the black arts, as well as to the vile god Innoruuk. To find one that had &quot;befriended&quot; a woodelf of Tunare was unheard of! He must have her under some sort of spell...<br><br>I spoke through clinched teeth - determined to free this young lady from the Dark One's influence.<br><br>&quot;Release your control over this innocent one and I shall allow you to leave this place unharmed.&quot; It was not a request.<br><br>&quot;Brave Knight, please hear me and understand!&quot; she begged, &quot;Yes, he is Tier'Dal, but I swear to you, he has cast no mesmerizing spell over me. I call him friend by choice - for I have witnessed his selfless deeds in battle, and his willingness to help others!&quot; She was speaking very quickly at this point, in an attempt to get through to me before I did something rash. &quot;Please do not judge him with blanket prejudice because of the vile actions of his people! Examine his heart and then make your decision!&quot;<br><br>I stood for what seemed like hours, hearing her words, but reluctant to allow them to penetrate the armor I'd placed years ago around my emotions. I scrutinized the dark elf standing calmly a few feet in front of me. He remained motionless with his hands resting at his sides - making no move to defend himself. I could easily have buried my axe in his chest before he blinked... but somehow, that didn't seem &quot;noble&quot;.<br><br>Conflicting thoughts battled in my mind and I shook my head to clear them. The people of Neriak were the sworn enemies of the Paladins. They had joined with the Ogres and Trolls to do battle with and violate everything that was pure and good and right. To ally with the dark elves was a death sentence, according to the rules of the Temple of Marr. They were responsible for countless slayings of untold innocents, just to further their cause in the world. They were the enemy and deserved no mercy. But the druid's insistance had certainly given me pause...<br><br>Suddenly a hideous cackle split the damp air. The soft ground between us burst open and threw the three of us off our feet. A slender bone arm reached from the grave and grasped my armored ankle, trying to drag me into the depths of the dead. I managed to maintain my hold on my axe and swung viciously at the skeletal hand. The monster shrieked and relenquished its hold just long enough for me to scramble out of reach. It placed its &quot;palms&quot; on the edge of the hole it had created and drug itself up from the ground.<br><br>Clods of mud fell from the skeleton's fleshless form as it rose to its full height. In life this beast may have been human, but now it was impossible to tell. Now, it was an abomination... an afront to all that was living.<br><br>&quot;AHHHH-hahahahahah!&quot; It cackled again as it lunged at the druid who had not yet regained her feet.<br><br>I brought my axe down hard toward the groping skeleton, feeling the crunch of bone. It screamed, this time in rage - and turned to face me. It shook off my axe as if it had been wielded by a child. The evil magic that has raised this monster from the grave was also providing it with inhuman strength. Its slashing fists pummeled me as we traded thunderous attacks. <br><br>Brell's blessing flowed through me and into my axe, and delivered a shattering blow. The skeleton was knocked back several feet - a reaction I was not prepared for. I mis-timed my next swing as my weapon whistled harmlessly past my foe, forcing me to stumble to my knees.<br><br>That was all the opening the skeleton required. It cackled in anticipated victory and dove for my off-balance body. The ice-cold grip of the grave seared my skin as the monster clutched my throat. Stars and bursts of light, like gnomish fireworks, exploded in front of my eyes. I tried to recall the words to my spell of expulsion, but the pain drove them from my mind. I tore desperately at the unyielding bone fingers... to no avail.<br><br>I couldn't breath... losing... consciousness. The lights before my eyes grew brighter as the thin veil between this realm and Brell's began to slowly part.<br><br>Suddenly the weight of the skeleton was ripped from my chest. The mocking laughter the beast had been spouting turned abruptly into a scream of suffering. Air raced back into my aching throat and lungs, throwing a dark blanket over the bursting lights. I rolled to my knees, coughing and gagging, and raised my pounding head just in time to see fire leap from the dark elf's outstretched hands. The flames smashed mercilessly into the animated bones of the undead and shattered them into miriad pieces.<br><br>Silence.<br><br>I collapsed back onto the wet ground - my strength having been sucked away. My breath came in heaving puffs and gasps. My heart threatened to explode from my chest.<br><br>The dark elf too, was breathing heavily, his magic having taken its own share of strength. I heard the soft rustling of his robes as he struggled to his feet.<br><br>&quot;What a horrible creature...&quot; the young druid panted. &quot;Tunare be praised its vile presence can no longer violate the beauty of this jungle. I'm sorry for your pain, Sir Knight...&quot;<br><br>I felt a strong, smooth hand in mine. I gripped it firmly, gratefully and pulled myself into a sitting position... and stared right into the face of the dark elf!<br><br>My first instinct was to pull away - the skin of my hand crawling at his touch... but he held my hand tight. Our eyes locked - and I saw, not the hatefulness I had expected... but thankfulness.<br><br>&quot;You risked yourself to save my friend, good Sir Knight,&quot; the dark elf spoke in a deep but soft voice. &quot;That is a debt I shall not soon forget. My magic was not strong enough to defeat that creature... but because of your help, he will plague us no more. Thank you...&quot; and his lips parted in a genuine smile.<br><br>Again the conflicts rushed over me. Everything I had been taught about these people seemed untrue as I looked at this man. He was... different. He could have let me die - or even run away with the druid while the skeleton's attention was on me... but he stayed. He stayed and saved my life.<br><br>My face flushed crimson as I realized the hatred of my prejudice had been glaringly plain. I cleared my throat and accepted his help, regaining my feet. My eyes narrowed as I examined him one last time - searching for any sign of duplicity... but I found none. Finally I returned his smile with a crooked one of my own, and gripped his hand in one firm shake.<br><br>&quot;It was...an honor to do so.... friend.&quot;<br><br> * * * * *<br><br>I look back on that day often with wonder. For so long in my life I judged people by outward appearances: the color of their skin, their land of origin, whether they were male or female. But since that time, I have learned to look deeper. Since then I have met and made friends with several &quot;Dark Ones&quot; who have proven themselves to be courageous, noble and trustworthy. No longer am I close-minded and cold. Now I live by the advice of young woodelf druidess: &quot;Do not judge others with blanket prejudice, but examine a person's heart and deeds and then make your decision.&quot; Wise words... wise words, indeed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Kaldolur Britebeard<br>Dwarven Paladin of the 50th season<br>Vazaelle</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&quot;The dogs are restless...&quot;<br><br>I stared into my mug of ale. I thought the old dwarf was drunk half out of his mind and had lapsed into babbling, so I didn't bother responding. He shifted slightly on his barstool and turned to face me, so I knew I could no longer politely ignore him.<br><br>&quot;Hmph!&quot; was all the comment I could muster. I had just returned from a month-long venture in the frozen lands of the Great Divide and I was weary from the journey. I wanted nothing more than to sit by the fire, smoke my pipe, sip warm ale - and relax.<br><br>The old dwarf leaned in close and I reeled from the alcohol on <br>his breath. His glassy eyes met mine and I saw a twinkle of coherence.<br><br>&quot;A NOBLE Paladin would want to know if people were in danger.&quot;<br><br>With his emphasis on the adjective - and the implied question of my character, he immediately had my full attention.<br><br>Two hours and a half-dozen mugs of ale later, found me on the north road to the volcanic mountains of Lavastorm.<br><br>The &quot;dogs&quot; the old dwarf was referring to, were the Solusek Kobolds of Nagafen's Lair. I was familiar with the area. I had joined a band of adventurers some time back and we braved the fiery canyons and tunnels of the dragon's keep, perched precariously on the edge of a lake of lava. The kobolds primarily lived in the tunnels and caves that led to &quot;old Naggy&quot; - so the odds of my actually running into the red dragon were practically nil. But something had agitated the kobolds (probably a bunch of headstrong kids turned adventurer-wanna-be's). That was why I was here. <br><br>The air was oppressive. The thick black ash from the volcanoes choked the breeze out so that nothing moved. Even the breath from my throat seemed to stop dead just past my lips. I began to sweat in my armor - a strange contrast to the chill the cold metal had left on my skin just a few days before in the snowy wastelands of my Coldain cousins.<br><br>I found the shadowy mouth of the cave with little trouble. &quot;Heh... right where I left it,&quot; I mused. Pulling my axe free from its sling upon my back - allowing the light from its enchanted, double-edged blade to brighten the dreary grey walls - I moved inside.<br><br>The stench was incredible. I was reminded forcibly of the old dwarf's breath which was almost as rancid. But this was different. This was the smell of death, decay. <br><br>Despite the aura from my axe, I stumbled over something on the floor... strangely soft. I muttered a quiet curse and adjusted my two-handed grip to see, not a rock as expected, but the body of an elf maiden. And not just one body... but a dozen. They were piled up along the walls and floor - elves, halflings, dwarves, humans - some with faces still contorted in the painful throes of death - screaming silently.<br><br>My heart skipped a beat, and I was forced to swallow the bitter bile that was rising in my throat. &quot;The dogs&quot; were indeed restless. In the distance, echoing off the tunnel walls, a wolf-like cry split the dark.<br><br>I drew a deep breath (difficult in the humid air) and prepared to delve deeper, when a raspy voice coughed near my elbow. I whirled around to find a young dwarf on his hands and knees gagging and gasping for air. I reached out and placed my hand upon his fevered brow and murmured a healing prayer. His breathing grew easier and his cough ceased. He nodded his thanks.<br><br>Again, I began to move deeper into the cave when the young dwarf stopped me.<br><br>&quot;Please sir, can you heal my friend?&quot;<br><br>My eyes fell to the floor where lay the many bodies of the kobold's victims. Even the High Clerics of Underfoot would be hard-pressed to undo all of the damage here. But if I could help one... I smiled at the young dwarf.<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; I replied. &quot;Which one is your friend?&quot;<br><br>He moved into a dark corner and pulled back a tattered cloak to reveal the body of a huge warrior - a barbarian by the looks of him. His shield was crumpled like paper, his chainmail hung in wisps about his broad shoulders and blood covered nearly every inch of his massive frame. Despite the heat of the lair, his body was cold in death.<br><br>I closed my eyes and knelt before the young barbarian's corpse. The words to Brell's Reviving Prayer formed in my mind, and I felt the exultation of His healing power course through my body. A brilliant blue light lit the chamber, so intense it shone even through my clamped-shut eyes. The moment passed. The power ceased. I slumped back - exhausted... always a side-effect of an answered prayer of this magnitude. Several minutes ticked by. My strength returned and I opened my eyes expecting to see the ill-fated but grateful duo with a request for safe escort from that place.<br><br>They were gone.<br><br>I was alone amidst the piles of bodies. A small frown creased my forehead as I rose to my feet. I looked up and down the passage but saw no one. Then, like the howl I had heard earlier, a voice echoed from down the dark tunnel - deeper within the cave...<br><br>&quot;Hey look! We haven't gone this way yet!&quot;<br><br>It was the voice of the young dwarf.<br><br>I sighed deeply in disappointment. Not only were these kids blundering blindly into a dangerous land, bringing destruction on themselves and everyone unfortunate enough to be caught in their wake, but they expected me and others like me to &quot;bail them out&quot; when they got in over their heads and didn't even offer so much as a &quot;thank you&quot;.<br><br>Several options came to me there in the dark - some not very paladin-like OR noble. But then, the words of Brell came to me as recorded in his book of wisdom, &quot;The Book of Duke (of Below)&quot;: &quot;Do not your good deeds in order to be seen by others. But rather do them in secret, so that Brell, who sees all things good and bad, will reward you at the end of your days.&quot;<br><br>Turning to leave, I offered a small prayer of thanks to Brell. I would return to this place - with a well-armed party of warriors to deal with the kobolds. I didn't need the admiration or the thanks of men... I had the thanks of my God.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Jun 13 13:16:31 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Kaldolur Britebeard<br>Dwarven Paladin of the 50th season<br>Vazaelle</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The snow crunched beneath my boots with every step. My breath puffed billowing, white clouds in the sharp air. Tsigoleog and I were hunting Frost Giants in the frozen Eastern Wastes of Velious. Tsig is a mighty wizard, and has the ability to go toe-to-toe against many beasties in the known world. I often stand in awe of his firepower.<br><br>We had been at this for what seemed like days, trying to put a severe damper on the population of Frost Giants in the area, and we had managed to work ourselves into a rhythm, in the hunt. We would spot the giant, announce our find with a hearty &quot;Hail!&quot;, Tsig would cast a spell to slow the monster down and fear it and then we'd pound the daylights out of it. My pack was filling up with gruesome trophies of war: giant toes and heads. All was going well, until...<br><br>&quot;Hail, a Frost Giant!&quot; I called to my companion.<br><br>Like so many times before, I pulled out my axe, ran straight up to the giant and began whackin', expecting the slow-moving behemoth to stumble and run. Almost instantly, I knew something was seriously wrong. WHAM! <br><br>I was hit with a series of ceaseless blows. The incredibly powerful fists of the giant smashed into me time and time again, driving me to my knees. I could barely raise my axe to get a swing in. What in blazes was different about this beast?!<br><br>Tsig could see instantly that I was getting waxed. With a few arcane gestures and some well-articulated words, he nuked the Frostie for an insane amount of damage. Sparks flew, and a barbaric roar split the air. The giant was not amused.<br><br>By the time I got to my feet, the giant had nearly crushed my wizard friend beyond recognition. The foul beast was jumping up and down on his frail, seemingly lifeless form. I could see that this called for drastic measures. I dropped my axe, ripped off my gauntlets and dove for Tsig's body. Murmuring a prayer to Brell, I placed my hands upon him just in time. Power flowed through me and into his battered body. His wounds healed instantly and he was restored to full health in the flash of moment. <br><br>Seeing that all of his &quot;hard work&quot; was for naught, the giant turned his wrath once again on me. I recovered my axe and after several more hard-fought minutes, toppled him like some hideous tree.<br><br>I collapsed into the snow, not really caring if any wandering Ry'Gorr of other giants happened by. I lay there, having only the strength and energy to gasp for breath. My blood flowed from beneath my armor and onto the snow. I knew we had escaped death by only the merest of fractions.<br><br>After several long moments, I had caught my breath and managed to sit up. I turned and found Tsig in much the same condition as myself. We looked at each other without words for quite some time. Finally, a small glimmer creased Tsig's dark eyes and the corner of his mouth twitched slightly. His voice cracked a bit as he spoke...<br><br>&quot;Umm... I wasn't ready.&quot;<br><br>We laughed. Slowly at first, because it hurt so much, but then we abandoned all caution to the wind and laughed harder. We dropped to our knees and continued our mirth - the humor of the moment bouncing off of the nearby hills. We laughed until we cried - our lungs, throats, faces aching with the effort.<br><br>An apology on my part would be forthcoming later, of course, in the form of spiced ale. Tsig forgave me, thankfully, for he is my good friend. The event was behind us, and we had survived. But you can rest assured, I'll never wade into battle again until I'm certain that he is ready!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu May 23 15:18:48 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Kaldolur Britebeard<br>Dwarven Paladin of the 50th season<br>Vazaelle</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I quickly surveyed the corpses littering the cavern floor... and soon realized that one of them was mine...<br><br>It was a simple quest, maybe even a little frivilous. I had been made aware of a magical bag that would make the items I carried in it considerably lighter. Normally a strong, healthy dwarf wouldn't have to worry about such things - but the concept intrigued me. I set off for the Tenebrous Mountains.<br><br>There were several items I needed to collect upon the way... all of which seemed to fall into my possession with relative ease. The final item I sought was reported to come from one of the foul residents of the Tenebrous Mountains... a Grimling runner.<br><br>&quot;Bah,&quot; I thought, &quot;'tis just ONE dirty little grimling... this will be easier than I thought.&quot;<br><br>I pulled mighty Soulfire from its scabbard so the light from the holy blade would guide me through the dark cave. I had heard stories that the runner's path brought him to the mouth of this cave frequently. I was prepared to sit and wait - perhaps even munch a few fish rolls in the process. <br><br>After a short walk, I could see pale light of the setting sun coming through the mouth of the cave. I was close to the spot I would camp. Soulfire tucked snuggly back in place, I walked with little care to the rock-hewn opening, wanting to catch a glimpse of the sun over these mountains that reminded me of home. There was no-telling how long my prey would be in coming heedlessly to his death.<br><br>I squinted against the sun, much brighter than I had anticipated. I raised my hand to shield my eyes - when I stopped dead in my tracks. There he was. I was standing face to face with a shaggy-headed, brown-skinned grimling. It was the stench of him that brought me back to my senses.<br><br>Soulfire flew from my scabbard, it's fiery blade ready to bite deep this foul creature. Our weapons clashed... he was quick, I had to admit. Several of my swings broke through his defenses, causing his blood to flow. As fast as his life was draining from his body, I would have thought to see fear in his eyes. But there was none. He glared at me with a calm assurance - almost as if he knew he wasn't going to die.<br><br>His weapon dealt a fair amount of damage to me as well. I began to sweat and wince in pain as the battle wore on. We seemed to be evenly matched - but surely my superior armor would help me be the victor.<br><br>Suddenly, I was brought to my knees by an incredible force. The crushing blow nearly knocked Soulfire from my hands - and the furious attack didn't let up. Someone had been waiting behind the rocks for the right moment to jump to the aid of the runner... I was barely able to lift my head against the barrage - to see a vampire!<br><br>I wasn't prepared for this! Scrambling madly, I crawled at first, then stumbled to my feet - trying desperately to find refuge in the cave I had just left. The vampire's claws tore at my flesh, my blood flowed freely. Just before I blacked out, I prayed to Brell - and his total healing flowed through my hands and into my battered body. For an instant, I toyed with the idea of facing this foul creature... but the rate at which he counteracted my healing quickly showed me otherwise.<br><br>I turned wildly - made one last swing with my sword before I would reach the solace of the dark cave... I could feel the cool air, safety was only a step away... I fell. The pain was gone... I knew no more.<br><br>Some time passed - I don't know how much, but suddenly I felt my spirit being pulled from someplace warm, comfortable - back to the real world. When I opened my eyes, there stood another holy paladin... an elven woman. She had been traveling from Katta Castellum through the mountains and saw my battle from a distance. She arrived too late to stop my demise, but made short work of the vampire and his filthy grimling buddy. And then, admist the carnage, she restored my corpse to life.<br><br>An embarrassed explanation on my part followed - to which she smiled understandingly. Then, true to the elven way - with respect for life and being prone to generosity - she reached into her pack and handed me the very bag I was seeking. &quot;I have the makings for several,&quot; she told me, &quot;and I always make it a point to keep collecting the items whenever I'm in the area.&quot;<br><br>I'm sure my bows, salutes and thank-yous sounded hollow to her, but I was very grateful. It just goes to show that the creed by which I try to live my life is true... &quot;Cast your bread upon the water, and after many days it will come back to you - pressed down, shaken together, running over.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put - do good for others without thought of reward, and it will come back to you in far greater ways that you could imagine. I will continue to live by this until the day I hang up my sword forever. The good that has been done to me - I will return to others...<br>&nbsp;<br>Kaldolur Britebeard<br>Dwarven Paladin of the 50th season<br>Vazaelle</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Although I'm dwarf, small in stature, I am proud of the fact that I have worked my way up through the ranks to become a 30th Paladin of Brell - untwinked, of course. Granted, level 30 is far from the pinnacle - but it is a worthy achievement none-the-less. Right?<br><br>You can imagine my chagrin then, as I stood before Marko in the Hall of Truth and inquired about the mystical sword, Soulfire.<br><br>"Art thou a squire?" He asked with no expression upon his face.<br><br>Squire?! Surely I had misunderstood him. Of course he hadn't had ample opportunity to recognize that it was me, Kaldolur Britebeard: slayer of thousands (well, most certainly hundreds) of orcs, defiler of DVinn! Why I personally have wandered the feces-strewn halls of Blackburrow, slaughtering gnoll commanders and elite by numbers untold! The fire goblins of Solusek have learned to tremble at the mere mention of my name! I wield the mighty sword Ghoulbane!! How dare he?!<br><br>But... if I fail to respond in proper manner, I will never receive the quest for the second Holy Sword. I swallowed hard and bit my lip...<br><br>"I..." Blast. "I am a s-squire." I murmured in a quite tone.<br><br>And just like that, Marko was off like a shot, explaining the steps I needed to take to prove myself worthy to the Paladins of the Hall of Truth. He had no idea the hell he had just put me through. He was also (apparently) unfazed at the monumental revelation I had just made. Hmpf! Oh well, what do you expect from a guy who hangs around the garden all day, just waiting for eager young adventurers to come do his dirty work for him?<br><br>Although the incident hadn't impacted Marko at all, it certainly made an impression upon me. And I learned a valuable lesson. No matter how experienced we become, no matter how many adventures we've got "under our belts", no matter how many seasons we live through - there is always still more. The important thing is, that we learn during those times, and always seek to improve ourselves - not in the eyes of others, but in our own eyes.<br><br>I've traveled across the Commonlands since that day, bought drinks for an old man at the Seafarer's Roost on the Freeport Docks, and even spent time with a babbling, deranged prisoner in the dungeons beneath the Freeport Arena. And with each adventure, as each day dawns anew - I ask myself one simple question: "How can I become a better person today?".<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Kaldolur Britebeard<br>Dwarven Paladin of the 50th season<br>Vazaelle</td></tr>
