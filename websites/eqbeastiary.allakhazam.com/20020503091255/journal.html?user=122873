Carefully replacing the journal where he found it and replacing the mask that hid a grim visage from the rest of the world, the Waywatcher silently returned to the forest.

Days and nights of blood and violence and vengeance had left Kaellin a grim, bitter warrior, with little room for such fine things as companionship. Phreda's journal was like looking into a different world - one of happiness, and optimism, and friendship. Kaellin promised himself that he would look in on her again - perhaps even exchange a story or two over ale...<br><br>Then his mind turned to darker things and the momentary respite from the endless struggle faded.<br><br>/ooc on<br><br>Love your journal, little lady!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>We did it, we finally joined a guild.&nbsp;&nbsp;Phanny and I arranged to meet Renlaria and a druid friend of hers in West Commonlands, to formally tie the knot with the Sands of Time.  Phanny was at first hesitant, because she didn't want to have to go to a lot of meetings.  This guild doesn't have any!  They just do good deeds and keep each other company.  <br><br>Renlaria offered to show me some of the guild has to offer its members.  Wow, I never saw a Wurmslayer before...  As Lemoni would say, she was bedecked with fineries.  She said I could borrow some things too, but I told her I wasn't in it for the goodies.  And I'm not.  (Yeah, let's see how long that holds out!)<br><br>Fortune also smiled upon me and Phanny, even before we joined the Sands of Time.  We ventured down into Runnyeye to survey its challenge; we found it a worthy place to spend some time.  Phanny has a quiet place to sit while I scout out for monsters.  The Sporali are funny looking candy-shaped creatures, who keep to themselves and are easy to find.  The Pickclaw goblins are plentiful; although they are tougher to beat than the Sporali, they often wear nice armor which makes up for the trouble.  I am already wearing a shiny black cape that we pulled from one of the Pickclaws with glee.<br><br>Oh yeah - I was charmed for the first time!  It was awful! One of the goblins used me against my sister.  I couldn't tell what was going on, but I could hear her cries of confusion and pain.  After I regained control of myself, I found myself next to her.  She said I attacked her!  She was scared half to death, because she knows I'm a death machine with these claws.  <br><br>I felt bad that I hurt her, but that's just the sort of problem adventurers must contend with.  Sometimes enchanting goblins take control of your brain and make you do bad things to your little sister.  <br><br>Come to think of it, I used that excuse when I was a kid, but my parents never believed me.  I swear, this time it's true!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed May  1 08:55:34 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While waiting for Doggans to arrive, a ranger named Jadl asked me if I'd like to hunt some bandits with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;I put him off until I was able to talk to Doggans (Phanny wasn't yet ready for action); we agreed to group with Jadl and a Vah Shir beastlord named Rawtooth.<br><br>We ran along the bumpy narrow path to the bandit camp at the far end of the stinky Paludal pool, then made camp behind one of the Recondite tents.  The situation deteriorated almost immediately....  Doggans was intent on picking fights with the bandits, despite the cries for regeneration on the part of our casters.  At times it seemed as if he didn't notice his own critical wounds.  I wished Phanny would arrive to relieve those fellows from the burden of healing.  They really weren't cut out for that business.<br><br>During the middle of one skirmish, I heard someone ask if &quot;camp two&quot; was taken.  Not knowing what they meant, I shouted back &quot;Which camp is &quot;camp two?&quot;  No reply.  A few moments later Phanny arrived.  She healed us tanks, and we all sat for a rest.  Suddenly six people gathered at the other end of the Recondite camp and proceeded to slaughter all remaining bandits.  We watched in astonishment.  Angry, I beckoned the others in my party to join me in the middle of the Recondite camp, in an effort to re-establish our territory.  The six strangers spread out around us and proceeded to kill every bandit as soon as it appeared.  Instead of being able to split the camp in two, they decided to take the whole camp without regard for us.  <br><br>I had a few private words with Mikull, the one of the six who had asked if &quot;Camp Two&quot; was taken.  Apparently WE were at Camp Two. I asked him why he bothered to ask if he obviously didn't care that someone was at the camp already.  I told him I shouted back asking which camp was Camp Two, so I could tell him if it was taken or not, and he said, &quot;No you didn't.&quot;  He further said that &quot;Since we made it all this way, we aren't going to leave now.&quot;  He expressed an insincere sounding apology and returned to his mates.<br><br>The five of us were out of luck.  There was apparently no room in Paludal Caverns for us.  We gathered at the entrance to Shadow Haven to contemplate our next move.  Jadl said he needed to bank, and ran off.  We all waited for him to return.  After a few moments, he shouted &quot;HELP ME!!!&quot; We looked around bewildered.  He from BEHIND us into Shadow Haven, with a train of bandits on his tail.  We picked off the bandits quickly.<br><br>He expressed disgust at the situation and said he was nearly killed.  Phanny asked him to walk back to her so she could heal him, but he didn't appear or answer.  A few minutes later we asked what he was doing.  He said &quot;I'm meditating - I had to spend all my mana healing myself.&quot;  That didn't make any sense to us - why didn't he just let Phanny heal him?  We resumed our conversation, waiting for him to return to us.<br><br>There we were, sitting and waiting for him to meet us in the main tunnel to Paludal Caverns, and joking with each other.  Suddenly we hear him again - &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE!!!  WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING ME??!!&quot;  Once again, we look around bewildered.  Once again he comes from BEHIND us with a half a dozen bandits chasing him.  <br><br>How did all four of us manage not to see him pass us by TWICE in the brightly lit tunnel?  He didn't see fit to meet us and tell us he was ready, he just ran right past us into the bandit camp.  After escaping the last batch of bandits, he told us very angrily:  &quot;Why didn't you follow me?  You're all a bunch of dumb newbies, and I'm not going to group with you anymore.&quot;<br><br>Me: &quot;Hey, some of us aren't newbies.  We never heard you say &quot;Follow me&quot; or &quot;I'm ready to go&quot; or anything like that.  We all thought you were still banking or meditating.  We wouldn't have done that to you on purpose!&quot;<br><br>So he left us.  We were all glad; however, between the outrageous camp theft and Jadl's strange behavior, the rest of our adventure was cloudy and dull.  Rawtooth, Doggans, Phanny and I went as far as Hollowshade Moor to find a suitable hunting challenge, but we found none.  We eventually split up, giving each other meager smiles and kind words before camping individually.<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Apr 24 10:46:47 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While contemplating our next move, Phanny caught sight of a similarly experienced fellow hanging out in Rivervale.&nbsp;&nbsp;She engaged him in conversation, hoping he would join us in Runnyeye.  He suggested we meet his friend Doggans, a halfling ranger, on the moon.  Since we didn't have any better plans, we agreed.<br><br>While waiting for the Nexus Scion to zip us up to Luclin, a couple of powerful casters buffed us like crazy!  They laughed and called us the &quot;Little Biggles.&quot;  I rolled my eyes but smiled too - it does sound pretty funny!  What is it about tall people that makes them think short people are &quot;cute?&quot;  I want to come up with some knee jokes to counter with.<br><br>I arrived at the rendezvous point before Phanny (she always drags her feet in Shadow Haven) and met Doggans and his Erudite enchanter friend, Huzyour.  While waiting for Phanny, two fellows ran past whose guild (Drunken Bandits) I have been wanting to join.  Those two were the first Drunken Bandits I had ever seen in person!  I flagged them down.  They asked if they could join us in our Recondite Bandit smashings, which was all right by us.<br><br>As a full party of six, we quickly decided that the camp across the wetfang pond would be more exciting.  Unlike last time, we had enough combined swordpower to enter the camp en masse instead of pulling bandits out a few at a time.  We gathered at their campfire and slaughtered continuously for a day or so.  The bodies stacked up around us like the Orc headquarters in Highpass!  We barely had time to eat or talk.  It was a blast!<br><br>Our party members were amusing and energetic.  Having two clerics around meant that neither one had to meditate constantly, a real treat for Phanny.  The Drunken Bandits, Dok and Zuruel, were as entertaining as I had expected.  I suspect I would fit into their guild just fine.  Unfortunately, their strict entrance requirements will require extra legwork on my part - but won't guarantee a spot for me.<br><br>The evening was definitely improved by friendly messages sent by friends - Potas and Renlaria.  Renlaria is a friend of Zargoth's; she introduced herself quite a while ago, and has been friendly ever since.  Renlaria suggested her own guild, the Sands of Time.  She said they were a service-oriented group; everyone was generous, hard working, and often silly.  That sounds pretty appealing, as does the lack of bureaucratic hoop-jumping.  They aren't as active as the Drunken Bandits; is that an advantage or a disadvantage?  I'm not sure.<br><br>Anyway, after no one had the energy for another bandit, Phanny and I said goodbye to everyone but Doggans.  We arranged to meet him the next time we are ready for more battling, hopefully in a few days.  He was a friendly chap, and willing to wait until we were ready.  I'm really looking forward to our next adventure!<br><br>Not only that, but I'm glad that we had some success after that awful Unrest experience.  It felt good that friends sent us greeting, and that I now have TWO guilds to consider.  Things are definitely looking up.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Apr 24 22:31:18 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As we approached Greater Faydark, a bard buzzed past and whistled appreciatively at us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he stopped, told us we were a strikingly cute pair of little ladies, and asked us to model our armor for him.  Surprisingly, he didn't sound like a cad at all!  Quite the contrary.  After we twirled around a bit, batted our eyelashes and giggled, he offered to run us to our destination.  We started to decline, but he kindly insisted to do us a favor.  He whipped out his little guitar and ran off, with Phanny and me in tow.  His song caused us to zoom faster than I have ever gone before in my life!  The spirit of wolf has nothing on this song!  WOW!  Phanny and I laughed all the way to Kelethin, dodging trees and unsuspecting wood elves.  This must be what a kite feels like.<br><br>At the lift to Kelethin, Phanny buffed our new friend very well.  We separated to settle our own bidnass... not long after that, we heard him shout, &quot;Good night everyone!  Especially to the lovely ladies Phreda and Phanny!&quot;  (Something like that, I can't remember his exact words.)  That was nice.  Oh, I wish I found out what his name was!  We never asked!<br><br>We're in Rivervale now, visiting the family and our training guilds.  We have other options for future destinations - Lake of Ill Omen, Highpass (the goblins couldn't hate me more anyway!), or maybe Everfrost.  I liked hunting elephants, and wooly mammoths are supposedly even bigger!  Yowza!<br><br>It would not be exaggerating to say we were demoralized by our fiasco in Unrest.  Phanny was in real danger of losing her right to cast her latest series of spells.  We have entered a nebulous period, feeling too weak for half of the world, and too strong for the other half.  I suppose this is what is called 'growing pains.'<br><br>To try to cheer ourselves up, Phanny and I got our hair done.  She now sports blonder hair, which is now pulled away from her face into twin buns with sticks holding them in place.  I also opted for the hair sticks, (fitting for a warrior that even her fashion accessories are sharp and potentially lethal!), but didn't dye my hair.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings, Phreda!&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been quite a long time since we corresponded last.  It is good to see your adventures are going so well, save the unfortunate events in Unrest.  (I know your pain well, my friend, believe me.)<br><br>I have had adventures in many places of late!  Recently, my good friend Goldiggin and I have been to such places as Upper Guk, Solusek's Eye, Permafrost, and the Rathe Mountains.  <br><br>Goldiggin and I have left the 7th Legion, mainly because so many members have gone, and few have joined.  We are now associated with a wonderful group called the Fallen Wolves.  Such a close knit family of friends!  Why within a weeks time, Goldiggin and I were in a regular group of six:  Ahmai the High Elf cleric of Tunare, Boebi the Ranger, Zorntok, beastlord of the Iksar, and Bristal, the Dwarf paladin of Brell invited Goldiggin and I into their &quot;pack&quot;.<br><br>This outstanding group has helped me to collect three of the four items I need to complete a quest for a staff much prized by wizards, the Staff of Temperate Flux.  I expect to acquire the last item very soon.<br><br>As for your adventures, I might advise you to try the Netherbian Lair in Luclin.  There are good challenges and money to be found.  I especially advise you to look for creatures called a Swarmcaller or Swarmleader (I'm terribly sorry, but I forget which carries the item I mention below.)  <br><br>One of these creatures is said to have a magical breastplate called Netherbian Chitin, which is harder then Fine Plate, if you can believe such a thing!  It is also considerably lighter, and is imbued with magical enchantments to make its wearer more powerful.  I strongly ugre you to get one of these, I promise you, you will be glad you did.<br><br>Warmest regards,<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Apr 12 16:31:13 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Arjaizen Izrhume<br>31st Circle Wizard of Erudin<br>Fallen Wolves</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc I don't do the EC flea market either... at least not to buy items.&nbsp;&nbsp;I may go there to sell. :-)<br><br>I haven't done much questing with Arjaizen before.  Anything beyond newbie quests requires that you are either far beyond the recommended level to perform it (if you plan to solo it,) or that you have a near full group to succeed.  Since I had few opportunities to do anything with a group for a long quest, I just didn't bother.<br><br>With the Fallen Wolves, it's like a new world has opened up.  They actually -wanted- to travel with me in pursuit of the quest!  We also acquired good experience in SolA, great cash in Rathe Mountains, and a fair amount of each in Permafrost.<br><br>Check the questing search engine on this site to find quests in any given level range for the class you want.  It can help to do a wish list of items you'd like to have, and see what it will take to get them.  That's what I did, and the Temp. Flux Staff was just what the wizard ordered. :-)<br><br>I wish you could join the Fallen Wolves too, my friend.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, after all this time, the Recondite bandits aren't much of a challenge anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagnor's Cauldron was chosen as our next destination.  <br><br>We stopped at the Felwithe bank momentarily, so I could trade my claws in for a Velium sword and an axe.  It is supposed to magically infuse me with the strength of a berserker if I use it, provided I am strong enough to wield it correctly.  I am on the verge of being able to use the magic on my weapons....  Might as well exchange my claws now so I don't have to come back, right?  Ohhhhh....<br><br>Dagnor's Cauldron looks like...  blue lint.  A large lake sits in the middle of it; goblin pirates scurry about.  We saw a camp with a human, elf and dwarf; one of them offered to heal us for free, but we had no need for it.  We killed a few goblins but quickly grew bored.  A couple of thwaps is all it takes to conquer the little green pirates.<br><br>A dwarf ran passed us, so I hailed him and asked him where we could find some action.  He told us, &quot;Unrest!  Follow me!&quot; and led us through Dagnor's Cauldron on the coast of the lake to a tunnel.  We thanked him heartily; his parting advice was, &quot;If you don't find the zombies outside to your liking, go into the haunted house.  The most terrible creatures rest in there.&quot;  All right!  Once again, our adventure sounds straight of a storybook!<br><br>Unrest was an abandoned mansion with zombies running around in the yard.  We found a topiary maze, but didn't want to get lost in it.  The zombies were very weak, so we headed into the house.  On the way there, we passed a giant ghost dwarf.... weird!  Phanny and I both did a double take.<br><br>Once inside the house, Phanny and I battled dark-boned skeletons and ghouls.  They hit surprisingly hard, and like to gang up on a girl.  Also, I discovered to my horror, my weapons were not nearly as effective as my claws.  I hadn't done so little damage since my 15th season.  And now I am 24!<br><br>We hid in a corner room while Phanny meditated.  While we waited people would scream in panic &quot;train to zone!&quot; every few minutes.  We could hear them from inside the house even!  The house, by the way, was very cool.  I was eager to explore more of it.  As soon as Phanny was ready, we ventured down a dark hallway.<br><br>Not 20 steps down the hall, a crowd of dark-boned skeletons tackled us.  We were nearly finished with them, and exhausted, when the ghost dwarf appeared from around the corner and attacked!  We tried to escape.  I died on the front porch of the house, and Phanny died a few feet ahead of me.<br><br>Determined to be more careful next time, we retrieved our corpses and settled in a small corner room next to the front door.  I would pull one or two monsters to Phanny instead of blithely wandering around the house.  Unfortunately, the place was empty of monsters except for a ball room - which was full of them!  No fewer than five skeletons and the ghost dwarf (who appeared with the skeletons AFTER I got their attention) chased me back onto the front porch and killed me.<br><br>Determined to be more careful next time, as well as being angry, frustrated, and bent on not letting the haunted house defeat us, we decided to stay on the front porch this time, and pull monsters from the front rooms while avoiding the ballroom and hallways.   This worked for a while....  However, during one fight, A third skeleton joined the two we were fighting, and killed me.  Phanny would have saved me, but at that moment a festering hag snuck up behind her and killed her with two hits.  Neither one of us actually saw her killer.  We died too quickly to turn around even.<br><br>The way we figured, even if we could have found a group of brave people to join us in the haunted mansion, no one party member could withstand such strong strikes from festering hags or ghost dwarves - not at our level of expertise anyway.  We grumbled our way back to our bodies once again, ran back to Lint World, and camped in the fluffy blue wilderness.<br><br>My next mission is to retrieve my claws.  It was a big mistake not bringing them with me.  The only question now is, where should we go next?<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yet again Phanny and I set out to tackle the bandit camp near Shadow Haven.&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the place was packed with other groups of hunters; there was no room for us.  I consulted a ruddy map I got from someone in the Bazaar, which indicated a second camp across the lake from the camp we were familiar with.  We decided to check it out.<br><br>This camp was empty of bandit hunters, and full of bandits!  The arrangement was perfect, except we needed one more person to ensure our survival in case of an all-out bandit attack.  Phanny contacted a lonely dwarf warrior, who met us at the outskirts.<br><br>Gnarf was his name.  He had the most fabulous pair of swords I had ever seen.  They made my nice claws seem paltry by comparison.  He was a nice guy though, and put his Centi longswords to good use.<br><br>As a team, we worked together well.  Between two warriors, a whole pack of angry bandits would be reduced to mincemeat in moments.  Phanny hardly had to heal us, and spent an unusual amount of time fighting them with us.  I pulled bandits out of the camp with my bow and arrows, and kept the flow almost constant.  It was a blast!<br><br>During one brief quiet time, Gnarf pulled out his fishing pole to try to get some wetfang fish for dinner.  His fishing line wouldn't go to the water though!  I laughed and said, &quot;I'll show you how to fish!&quot;, jumped in the water and tackled a wetfang with my bare hands (well, claws).  I accidentally shredded the fish beyond hope of bringing up a fillet, but I did grab one of its eyeballs back to my friends.  I offered it to Phanny to eat, but she wrinkled her nose up at it.<br><br>During another rest, I sang to them the (only) dwarf drinking song that I know.  They applauded and cheered and jumped for joy! That was a really great feeling!  I got some of the words wrong, but decided then and there to get the song all right and sing it to other people too.<br><br>After a long while, Gnarf had to leave to help some of this guildmates retrieve a corpse.  We said goodbye; he told us he hadn't had so much fun in a long, long time.  Cheers, Gnarf!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Mar 30 16:57:14 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Once again, Phanny and I were alone - the rest of the crew had gone their separate ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;We knew we could probably take a band of gnolls on our own, which sounded like an amusing proposition.  Unfortunately, all the gnolls in the immediate vicinity were engaged by other adventurers, none of whom seemed to suffer from a lack of a short, vivacious tank-healer duo.<br><br>So we made our way back to the aviak huts to give them one more chance.  We met and made friends with a dwarf druid named Bamazo, and agreed to tackle the aviaks as a unit.  I also agreed to sell him the zombie skins that Gapeers Johannis likes at the Rivervale clerics' guild.  Bamazo was trusting of us to purchase three stinky flesh swatches, but we knew he would not be disappointed with Gapeer's Acolyte's anklet.  However anticlimactic, the final resolution to that protracted zombie flesh affair was satisfying.<br><br>It wasn't long before the three of us realized that, despite Bamazo's fearless hut raids, the aviak huts were ultimately boring and unchallenging.  Suddenly the Paludal Caverns were looking a lot more entertaining, even though we spent so much time there my skin was starting to turn pale.  I asked Bamazo if he had ever been there, and if he would like us to show him.  We promised that he'd see a lot of action, to which his ears perked up.  The matter settled, he gave us all the spirit of wolf; we ran the short distance to the spires and zipped up to Luclin.<br><br>True to our promise, the Recondite bandits weren't shy.  Bamazo was ever so pleased at the hectic pace -- we were too!  He was a handy chap to have around, knowing well when to fight and when to heal his party members.  He was also a pleasant conversationalist, another invaluable trait in a fellow adventurer.<br><br>Phanny and I are talking in private about starting a guild.  We keep meeting the nicest people.... Unfortunately everyone we would want to invite is already in another guild.  Some guilds are very large and active, and we can't immediately offer those same benefits.  Still, I daydream about an all short guild while I hack away at bandits.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Mar 30 16:24:23 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

I asked her if she remembered you, and she did!  Her name is Ermintrude, remember her?  <br><br>Anyway, we tried to fight the aviaks, but I accidentally irritated an avocet.  He chased us into the Lake Rathetear area.  It was funny - I didn't know my way around South Karana, so Ermintrude was yelling, &quot;go south!&quot;  I fled while fumbling with my compass.  Almost ran into a few trees too.<br><br>Guess who we saw in the entrance to Lake Rathe?  Potas!  That's how he was so speedy in meeting us.  He was horribly outnumbered fighting gnolls, so the three of us helped beat them off of him.  The four of us stayed there for many hours, killing gnoll embalmers, exhumed gnolls and unusually tough skeletons.  They are so disgusting!  Nasty!!  Bleah!  Nevertheless, at least Lake Rathe is active.  There are too many people fighting over too few aviaks in South Karana.<br><br>Anyway, I really liked your friend Ermintrude, and hope to see her again someday.<br><br>Hugs and kisses,<br>Phreda<br><br>P.S. Phanny can resurrect now, hooray!<br>__________________________________________________<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Mar 25 18:57:22 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>We had a long day, so I won't write much -- <br><br>Phanny and I took the teleporter back down to Norrath this morning, to land in North Karana.&nbsp;&nbsp;Phanny led me to the gypsy camps so she could bind our souls back on Norrath.  If we had died before she cast the spells, we would have been delivered unto the moon!<br><br>Neither one of us has ever been to South Karana before, and neither one of us thought to find a map first.  We crossed the bridge that separates North from South and surveyed the empty, rolling plain.  Our goal was to find the Aviaks, a race of small birds who were rumored to pack quite a punch.<br><br>&quot;Which way do we go?&quot; Phanny asked.  &quot;Follow me!&quot; I exclaimed, and bounced away. &quot;Do you know where we're going?&quot; Phanny called out.  &quot;Not a clue!&quot;  I giggled, still running.  I was excited to see a new area, and glad we didn't know exactly where the aviaks live.<br><br>We ran up tall hills to get a birds-eye view of the land.  Whenever we saw a large structure, we'd make a beeline for it.  In this manner we discovered a city of Centaurs, a playground populated by putrid undead, and pyramid flanked by wussy skeletons and zombies.  <br><br>The centaurs were entirely new to both of us.  I thought they were only in storybooks!  While they seemed indifferent to our presence on the outskirts of their village, we chose not to risk raising their ire by bothering their people.<br><br>We did, however, knock down two elephants.  One of them nearly crushed Phanny as it sank to its knees in the throes of death.  I took a tooth from one, and Phanny saved a tusk from another.  That tooth is about the size of my fist.<br><br>Phanny was dragging her heels after running ALL DAY.  The sun was setting fast and we hadn't made camp yet.  Luckily, just as the sky was turning purple, we spotted a group of huts with Aviaks.  We hunted a straggler guard before we settled here for the night.<br><br>It's late, we're sure to have a busy day tomorrow!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Derek, (a.k.a. Scrappy, Scrap Dog, TOR!) was practically the first friend we made in Knoxville.&nbsp;&nbsp;We go WAY BACK.<br><br>Anyway, Derek landed a lead role in an indie feature-length film, which had its &quot;world premiere&quot; last night at ValleyFest, our regional annual film festival.  Throwing all hope of a decent night's sleep out the window, we drove to Knox Vegas and met the extended posse at the theater.  Derek was there of course, as were his parents.  <br><br>The movie was ****ing HILARIOUS.  It's a darn good thing it was supposed to be a comedy, because the audience was in stitches.  The last time I heard so many laughs in a theater was for &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou,&quot; a few years ago.  <br><br>The reason I'm bothering telling you this is this:  Derek portrayed a slacker/perpetual college student/video game freak, a true addict.  He couldn't stay away from his computer.  It seduced him with a sexy voice when he was not using it.  &quot;I wish you'd put your hands all over me....  I love how you turn me on....  Let me satisfy you for hours, and hours....&quot; <br><br>His gaming was practically all he talked about with his friends.  He'd excitedly describe in excruciating detail epic conflicts, near deaths; the camera would flashback to Derek and the computer screen.  Meanwhile, his buddies would pretend to stab themselves with their dinner knives.<br><br>And what he was playing? Yep, you guessed it.  I almost squealed when I instantly recognized the first clip, that of an Erudite entering Toxx Forest.  Later there was an extended flashback of a heavy PVP fight.<br><br>It was very amusing for us to sit next to Derek in the theater, watch him on the big screen getting financially cut off from his onscreen parents, and hear his real life parents behind him cheering the onscreen parents.<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>We took a break from fighting the thieves' camp in the Paludal Caverns to sell their former possessions and shop around a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Phanny and I wandered into the Bazaar of Shadow Haven.  We were surprised how empty it was!  We never really noticed it before.  Most of the awnings have no merchants under them.  We ran around almost an hour before we found someone to buy from us.<br><br>It gave me an idea though - Phanny and I keep a few of the better pieces of armor when we loot it.  Now that our bank box is almost full, we could borrow one of those awnings in the Bazaar and sell them like merchants do!  Actually, Lemoni might be a better candidate for that.  I'll talk to him about it, and to Phanny too, when she wakes up.<br><br>Oh yeah - we saw the horse stables!  They were beautiful animals.  We even saw a couple of little horses who were the perfect size for us, but they were SO expensive.  We'll probably never have that kind of money.  sigh....<br><br>The next time we entered the Thieves' camp, Foddaman was gone.  That was too bad, it was down to me and Phanny now.  Up ahead an Erudite caster fellow and an Ogre(?) sat quietly on a rock.  Phanny asked them if they were waiting for the thieves to come out, but neither one of them answered her.  We shrugged and walked to the center of the camp.  Big mistake - six or seven thieves surrounded us completely, shouting loudly.  Between the inability to see beyond the circle of thieves around us, and the incredible din they caused, Phanny and I kind of freaked out and ran willy-nilly just to escape!  Unfortunately, Phanny died in the tunnel.  I barely made it back to Shadow Haven with my life.<br><br>We approached the camp a second time with much more caution.  After a few fights, however, the thieves converged upon us like before.  Phanny and I fought like mad, picking off one to find two more replacing it behind us.  Our health drained, the blows we dealt slowed from increasing exhaustion.  <br><br>Then suddenly, some of the thieves started dropping like flies, and a GIGANTIC bear walked up behind Phanny!  I screamed, thinking he was a monster who would swallow her whole.  Phanny gave me a curious look, turned around, and saw the bear.  She screamed too!  We scattered.  <br><br>After screaming and running for a few seconds, we both stopped for breath to discover that the camp was once again quiet. The bear wasn't eating us either.  I sighed hard, then looked over to where we were fighting; the rest of the thieves were dead.  We crept up to the bear and looked up at his steamy snout.  The bear was chuckling at us.<br><br>&quot;Pifpaf's my name,&quot; said the Erudite, &quot;and this is my pal Oddball.&quot;  &quot;Pleased to meet you sirs, you really saved us!&quot; Phanny exclaimed.  I bowed to each of them.  &quot;We'll help you pick off the bandits while we wait for the owlbears.  We need something from them.&quot;  That sounded good to us.<br><br>So for the rest of the day, Phanny and I had two guardian angels.  Pifpaf zotted the thieves so we could save our energy; Oddball the Bear (who was the ogre? from before) healed us during battle.  Phanny meditated sitting UNDER the bear, for better protection.  That looked pretty funny!  He could have squished her flat though, all he needed was to forget she was there and sit on her.<br><br>Oh yeah - one of the Vah Shir thieves had a sweet set of claws.  I pried them from his hands after he fell.  They were of amazing quality.  To my great dismay, they didn't fit!  Argh!  I can't wear them at all.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Mar 14 15:04:00 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I met Phanny in Rivervale, where she finally satisfied her obligation to Gapeers Johannis.&nbsp;&nbsp;He rewarded her (and Rainah's and Lemoni's and Zargoth's!) diligence by giving her a beautiful anklet.  She replaced her dingy, well-beaten scarab boots with the anklet, and stuck her foot out for me to see.  Phanny is especially glad that her feet are now free of the constrictive scarab shell.  We halflings are not the shoe-wearing type, but as a travelling warrior, I can't afford to forgo any type of armor for the mere sakes of comfort or tradition.<br><br>While I was doing a relatively poor job of gathering silks and pelts for Rainah, Phanny, clever girl that she is, figured out how to get to the moon.  She learned that a wizard spire in North Karana has been converted to a lunar teleportation device, and where we could find it.  The prospect of going to the moon was so exciting, we couldn't resist!  <br><br>I never knew those pretty white spires were wizard spires until that day.  We talked to a lady standing between them, and she gave us a stone to carry.  It looked just like a diamond, but was way too big to be genuine.  Soon the spires activated and everything went black!<br><br>Thump, we landed on a platform in a cavernous room.  We exited to a long hallway PACKED with people!  There were so many odd folks of all races milling around, Phanny had much difficulty walking to the other end.  <br><br>We saw several merchants with awnings attached to buildings, but they all told us they hated our type and wouldn't sell to us!  Pshaw!  Nobody ever said that to me before!  That was too bad, too, because some of them had really nice things for sale.  One merchant had beautiful robes, perfect for Lemoni's next birthday.  Oh well.<br><br>We eventually found the exit to Shadow Haven. (That's what the city is called, although a more fitting name would be &quot;Curmudgeon Haven!&quot;)  We overheard the guards call our destination &quot;Paludal Caverns.&quot;<br><br>The carved rock walls of Shadow Haven's outskirts turned dark and mossy.  After a short distance it opened up to a huge cavern.  Below us we could see a camp of what looked like an rainbow coalition of thieves and miscreants - gnomes, halflings, humans, elves, and Vah Shir.  Thrilled with the opportunity laid out before us, Phanny and I gave a hoot and dived in!<br><br>The thieves, catburglars (who really were cats!), demogogues and pickpockets turned out to be worthy opponents.  We met and formed a group with an elf ranger named Foddaman McFodda.  He was just a little bit older than us, and let us do all the looting!   That was very generous of him, especially since the loot consisted of nice bronze armor and weapons.  Like Highpass, the place was hopping.  We barely had a moment's rest from one bad guy to the next; often we were bombarded by two or three at once.<br><br>Only once did we suffer a casualty, and it was me.  There were just too many burglars, not to mention an owlbear (what strange creatures they are!)  Once conscious, I limped back half naked to where my comrades were nursing their wounds.  After gathering my stuff, I said, &quot;cheer up! have some beer!&quot;  and handed Foddaman four short ales.  <br><br>He drank them all immediately and started jabbering incoherently.  I thought he was speaking Elf to us, but Phanny laughed and said he was too drunk to talk!  He couldn't walk very well either.  That looked like fun, so I chugged my remaining four short ales and joined him in complete inebriation!<br><br>Three hours later, we were STILL drunk and talking like idiots.  Short ales last a long time, even with my considerable Biggles alcohol tolerance!  Phanny sat patiently and waited for us to regain the ability to walk straight.  We tested our sobriety by attacking a lone sensate reishi mushroom before we rejoined the thieves camp.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Mar 22 10:49:39 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I had the weirdest dream last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably shouldn't have eaten all those meat pies before bedtime.  <br><br>I dreamt I was very tall, much taller than normal.  I felt like me; didn't ever catch my reflection in water though.  (Maybe that's impossible in dreams?)  I could run very fast too, and cast spells.  I couldn't cast on monsters, and actually, I'm not sure what those spells did when I cast them.  It was fun to make all those blue and green lights fly around my body though!<br><br>The landscape was so strange, unlike any place we've ever been.  It was night-time all the time, neither sun nor moon to brighten the pitch black sky.  There were big rocks and little rocks, and plants that looked like skeletons until you walked right up to them.  It felt like a desert, except it was cool instead of hot.<br><br>Phanny wasn't anywhere to be found.  There were little two-legged lizards running around everywhere, and the fattest worms I've ever seen!  They were bigger than snakes.  Little skeletons also wandered around, many of whom carried funny little dolls.  I killed one and put its doll in my satchel to give to Rainah later.  She has wanted a doll for quite some time now.<br><br>Later, I don't know how I got there, but I was someplace where the moon looked so big, it seemed to take up most of the sky!  There weren't many trees around, and they had weird blue leaves.  They dropped fruit which tasted good, but I don't remember their flavor anymore.  <br><br>I walked down a path, trying to find my way home.  Suddenly a skeleton attacked me.  Now, normally, I just swat them away, but he stunned me instantly!  I regained my bearings and fled.  Other skeletons whom I passed started chasing me also.  After a little while, there were at least a half a dozen of them behind me.  I ran and ran and ran, the way you do in nightmares: you feel your legs running, but you don't seem to be able to go very far.  <br><br>I finally woke up with a shudder.  Day was breaking on the Commons. I was glad to see the sun again.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Mar  6 16:28:01 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Guess who I bumped into in the Commons, while slaughtering spiders with an unfair advantage?&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainah!  She looked awful!  She was pale and almost green, and she had bandages all over her legs, arms, and head.  I gave her my sack full of pelts and silks; she was very happy to receive the bounty.  She then asked me where Phanny was.  &quot;She's in Misty Thicket I believe,&quot; I told her.  &quot;Her Barbarian friend needs help surviving the scary goblins!&quot;  Rainah smiled knowingly.  It wasn't too long ago that the goblins in the Thicket posed a danger to her too.<br><br>I asked her why she needed to talk to Phanny, and if I could help with anything.  So Rainah sat down and explained the situation to me.<br><br>Lemoni and Rainah wanted to surprise us with the rest of the weird flesh bits we needed to satisfy Mr. Johannis at the cleric's guild.  They already picked up the zombie sailors' flesh from Wisp Isle, so they ran the very long way from Qeynos, the Karanas, Highpass, Kithicor, and West Commons to Freeport.  My, that was one heck of a trip!  <br><br>On the way, Rainah attracted the attention and ire of a dark elf named Gex(?), who proceeded to zap her to death!  While Lemoni was waiting for Rainah to meet him again, (she had to wait for morning to cross Kithicor,) a strange phenomenon occurred which had everyone shouting and running around in a tizzy!  All of a sudden, hundreds of bixies and willowisps, and some GRIFFONS too, descended upon East Commons and attacked anyone they saw.  Lemoni was unfortunately overcome by no fewer than five willowisps.  He eventually found himself standing next to Rainah at the entrance to Kithicor, both of them mostly naked.<br><br>Anyway, they reached Freeport, and entered the sewers as Phanny and I did earlier.  They had no problem coaxing drowned zombies out of the bottom of the pool (Rainah and Lemoni can both swim a little bit), but after a few fights they were both diseased!  They could not risk another fight while half dead, so they decided to wait for the disease to fade.  <br><br>First, to pass the time, they entertained each other with their illusions.  After that became dull, they decided to practice swimming.  They discovered that if they turned into gnomes, they could swim in shallower water.  After a while they noticed that if they weren't sitting still, the disease would drain their health.  &quot;That's okay,&quot; they told each other, &quot;we always have bandages.&quot;  But then they realized they were OUT of bandages.<br><br>They ran as fast as they could back to Freeport, then split up to ask each merchant for bandages.  The first several had none, and the elves' health dropped to very dangerous levels.  Luckily, Lemoni found a merchant selling bandages in the Arcane Science complex, and bought a sack full of them to split with Rainah.  She sat quietly and waited for him to heal himself and return to her, because she would die if she ran to meet him.  <br><br>They were very lucky they didn't die a slow, painful death!  They were still diseased after their fiasco, and still haven't accomplished their task.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As predicted, I couldn't take the peace and quiet and went for a little jaunt!&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't until 9:00 p.m. that I left home, a terrible time to run through Kithicor.  So, to pass the time until morning, I ran around Misty Thicket, killing spiders for the silks, wolfs for their pelts, and wasps for their wings.  (I'm helping Blikxen Entopop with his bug collection.)  One halfling offered to sell me spiderling silks for one plat each!  I wasn't THAT desperate, so I turned down his offer.<br><br>Sometime in the early morning, Itaknoir sent me a message telling me he had a present for me!  Woo hoo!  He told me to stick around Misty Thicket, and he would port there soon.  Late afternoon, he arrived and gave me two weapons - a handsome velium two handed sword, and kodiak claws!  The kodiak claws were admittedly a bit less powerful than my current claws, so I tried to give them back.  But he said, &quot;keep them - I sold fifty of them already.&quot;  Well, okay!  <br><br>Then he said, &quot;hold still...&quot;  and started casting a spell.  As the green glow subsided, I felt so different.  I looked down and realized he turned me into a wolf!  THAT WAS SO COOL!  Excited, I ran circles around him, jumping and barking.  So fast, so powerful!  Then I ran back to him and licked his hand, which seemed to be the most sincere thanks a wolf could give.  Halflings heard me shouting with glee and surrounded Itaknoir, all asking to be turned into a wolf too.  He was clearly amused to turn a dozen halflings into wolfs and unleash them into Misty Thicket, so he happily obliged.  <br><br>After saying goodbye and promising to visit him again soon, I ran off toward Kithicor, figuring I still had time to cross it before the undead commenced their nightly rounds.  (To my dismay, I reverted to my normal self by the time I reached Rivervale.)  As I started to run through Kithicor, I realized it WAS awfully dark in there!  It was 8:00 p.m., definitely night time.  I ran as fast as I could to the Commonlands.  Destination:  Nektulos Forest!  I had a score to settle with a certain border guard.<br><br>The border guard wasn't there though!  A gnome in a black robe with a red demon familiar sat where the guard stood before, but he wasn't aggressive at all.  So I decided to find the guard myself.  A path led into the forest, so I followed it in a semi-sneaky fashion.<br><br>After a good long walk I spied two large things.  One was a gigantic tree laying on its side on the ground, apparently chopped down.  The other thing was a stone structure that looked like a tent without the canvas.  And in front of that structure were two guards!  I could tell even from a distance that I would most likely beat them easily.  Then one of them spotted me and started running and yelling.  <br><br>I turned around and let them chase me for a bit. I wanted to get closer to EC before I let him have a taste of hobbit revenge!  Some tall folk passed me and, assuming I was in trouble, starting hitting the guards following me.  Not wanting to lose my prey, I turned around then and started clawing a guard.  The words, &quot;that's all right, I don't need any help,&quot; had not yet escaped my lips when the tall folk ran away!  I was confused by their actions until a third guard ran up and hit me HARD.  Ow!  I glanced down at the pool of blood at my feet and realized I could only survive a few more of his blows.  I limped as fast as I could back to the Commonlands, while all three guards played target practice on me.<br><br>I'm a bit chagrined now, but am determined to see what's in and beyond this forest full of evil, and to see what's under those big guard helmets too!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Feb  7 09:09:13 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Miss Biggles,<br><br>It both dismays and amuses me to learn of your particular interest in our fair city. I thought it fitting to pen this letter in hopes of answering a few of your questions, and perhaps assauge your curiousity without the need for violence.<br><br>Our guards, as you may have already ascertained, and not Drowic themselves. Of course, the only way you might note this is to realize that they are a foot or so taller than Ourselves. Every once and a while, a human from Freeport or Highpass will come to realize the true powers of Hate, and swear his fealty to Innoruuk. These humans flock to Our gates, begging for our enchanters to turn them into Dark Elves, the Perfect Children of Our Great Father.<br><br>Of course, this cannot be accomplished, since humans are not born with the dark blood in their veins and are thus unworthy of Our Form. However merciless you might think We are, the Drow do not openly slay Our brothers in Hate. Rather, we give them a chance to serve us, as pets.<br><br>Outside the dark guilds, in the bowels of Our Great City (which you will never see), is a den of ghouls. These ghouls have taken up residence here as they love to feed on the skeletal pets summoned by Our Heretics. We tolerate their presence as they also keep the place clear of rats. Any human warrior that comes to us is allowed to prove his worth by battling these ghouls. If he survives, he becomes a guard of the forest. If he is found unworthy, he joins the ranks of the many undead to roam the Forest of Eternal Night.<br><br>Humans, as a rule, are inferior to the Drow. They are less intelligent, less agile, less charming and they are generally more crude. Were it not for their brute strength, We would have no use for them at all. But human guards do make lovely pets and if one is slain by a brazen halfing, it is of no great loss to Us. <br><br>In fact, the Drow have pet servants from all the races of Norrath. Do stop by Neriak sometime, and seek me out. I do think you would make a lovely little slave.<br><br>Cordially,<br><br>Mistress Chaesendra D`Morte<br>Ambassador of Neriak<br>Daughter of Innoruuk<br>Childe of Hate<br>Leader of the Order of the Raven<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 44th sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>These last few days have been nice and relaxing, but already I'm eager to set out once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Phanny can't come out and play, I might take off without her for a while!<br><br>Not too long ago I saw a young druid in Misty Thicket killing a fire beetle with all the strength he had!  I watched him to make sure he would not be killed, then gave him all the money I had on me (only about 10 silver!).  As I turned to leave, he said &quot;Thank you very much!  Now I can buy a spell!&quot;  <br><br>I stopped dead in my tracks....  He looked pretty unequipped.  But my non-magic-using head forgot that some halflings have to pay for spells on top of everything else.  My heart went out to that little guy!  I ran right back to him and gave him all my food, water, bandages, my fishing pole and all my worms too!  It was all that I had to give him at the moment. He bowed and thanked me again; I practically bounced away.<br><br>That was a while ago, and I still hadn't replaced any of those items.  So yesterday evening, as the sun was setting (always a good time to be outside!) I wandered around town, picking up fishcakes and such to refill my travelling bag.  I wanted to play with my fletching kit too!<br><br>As soon as I wandered into the main square in front of the tavern and bank, I was accosted by no fewer than three halflings, all begging me for things simultaneously!  Two wanted money, and one wanted a weapon.  The fellow who asked for a weapon was already carrying one!  Not only that, but he had some fairly decent looking equipment too.  I couldn't believe his nerve.  I scooted past them all and went into the bank to retrieve my fletching kit.  <br><br>While rooting around in my safe deposit box, a FOURTH halfling tapped my shoulder and quietly asked me for money.  I turned around, ready to start shouting - but stopped because it was a girl.  She said she was a warrior and needed some help.  Well... maybe it wasn't fair of me to help only one, but I felt a kinship with this fellow tank girl.  <br><br>I inspected her to see what she needed, dug around in my bag of looted armor bits, and found a banded mail chestpiece that would fit her.  Sure that she would be pleased with it, I presented it to her.  And do you know what she said?  &quot;Do you have anything for my head?&quot;  She was already wearing something on her head.  It didn't make any sense, and it made me mad.  I replied, &quot;you mean, instead of the banded mail?&quot;  She quickly said, &quot;never mind!&quot; and ran off.<br><br>What is it with kids these days?  Instead of cutting their teeth in Misty Thicket, they bum around Rivervale and bother people.  I never did that, ever.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Feb  6 07:51:47 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc<br><br>After a couple of months of regular updates, Tales of a Halfling Tank Girl is unusually silent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Phreda is taking a temporary rest, while I build Lemoni up to a useful level.  In the meantime, I've posted a few things in Pusbag's journal, which I hope you will enjoy.  My RL sister and I will soon bring our enchanters to 16, at which point we'll go revive the Diminuitive Dynamic Duo.  I can't wait!<br><br>Now that Lemoni has some half decent spells (namely Illusion: Dark Elf, Charm, Choke and Bind Affinity) he isn't as aggravating as before.  A lot of people have said they got tired of their enchanters and deleted them before they even made it to level 12.  Also, after playing him the last week or so, his personality has started to gel.  <br><br>He has four different colors of robes, keeps all of them on hand, and changes them frequently.  He has also developed a fondness for exotic foods, (Arctic Scallops anyone?) and a corresponding disdain for &quot;rations.&quot;  Those aspects, along with his vocabulary, make him seem rather... effete.  But he isn't a stuffy guy.  For instance, the other day, Lemoni was singing &quot;She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain&quot; to Rainah as they ran through the Karanas.  I'd make him more of a goofball, but what would people think about a color-changing elf with snooty food and dumb jokes?  Enchanters are hard to solo!<br><br>Some characters are natural extensions of who the player wants to be, or perceives herself to be.

After weeks of eyeing your journal suspiciously, with an &quot;I'll get the that one soon&quot; in my mind I finally said down and read it cover-to-cover. How wonderful!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc<br>Gee, thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp;I WILL keep writing, it's too much fun not to.  Playing makes me want to write, and writing makes me want to play.  It's a vicious cycle, really.  Also, I'm trying to recruit Phanny (my RL sister) to sign up so she can add her own side of the story to my journals.  She writes better than I do.<br><br>Being so close to the ground is great; as a tank, I rest easy knowing the casters behind me can see over my head.  However, once Phreda is strong enough, she'll be tackling giants, dragons, yeti etc., and the height not be such an advantage!  She might resort to a pair of stilts!<br><br>Thanks for the invite, I certainly will consider it.  Starting a completely untwinked, hybrid-class character sounds appealing, and knowing I'd have friends waiting on me would help finalize the decision.<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>How delightful it feels to take that heavy chainmail off for a while, knock back honey meads at the Fools Gold, and run around the old stomping grounds in my bare feet!&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't spent so much time at home since I decided to become a warrior.  I'm still working on my fletching.  Mistakes are still pretty common, but I happily lose track of time tying all those little parts together.  And of course, revenge on those annoying bixies is also sweet.  Stupid bixies!<br><br>I finally got to visit with Lemoni.  After dropping off my tradeskill goodies, he went to the orc camps in Misty Thicket to kill time (and orcs) until I arrived.  We spent an afternoon chatting outside, enjoying the lovely weather.  <br><br>I watched him hawk his jewelry; he always kept one eye on the entrance to Misty Thicket while we talked, and gave a shout about his wares when he saw a potential customer wander into town.  On more than one occasion we were surrounded by hobbits a bit younger than me, clamoring for this ring or that bracelet.  He seemed to stand taller when he had customers lined up; he obviously enjoyed getting attention for a job well done.  And his auctioneer's skills have noticeably improved as well.  He has quick and informative answers for any questions about his jewelry, and he usually bowed and thanked each customer heartily.  It made me feel better about where my money was going.  <br><br>Phanny and I have done some serious talking together lately about what we were going to do with ourselves.  Lemoni has already helped us out with his jewelcraft, and his potential is sky-high!  Rainah recently started training to be a tailor. I took my old unused sewing kit out of the bank, and am filling it with silks and pelts to give to her for practice.  <br><br>But other than my fletching, which is really just to kill time while Phanny meditates, Phanny and I aren't doing anything to better ourselves.  Phanny has tentatively decided to try her hand at blacksmithing, and I chose brewing.  If anything we might save a bit of money drinking a river of homebrew instead of the fancy storebought ales and brandies we've grown accustomed to.  I love to drink, but Phanny has raised it to an art form.  She can really pack it away!  And speaking of packing it away, she must carry a whole knapsack of bottles with her. She never seems to run out, and always has some to pass around.  I'd like to eventually surprise her with my own personal brew.  What should I call it.... Phreda's Fine Lager?  yum yum.<br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>At last the time had come to conclude our business in Highpass and run home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeks upon weeks of hunting orcs, goblins and gnolls yielded a sack full of bloody pelts and ears, yuck!  Phanny and I weren't enthusiastic about turning them in to the appropriate captains spread about, but the nasty creature bits wouldn't do us any good elsewhere.  Luckily, on the way to the gnoll guard captain, we were stopped by an elf (or half elf?) who wanted to buy any pelts we had.  As it turned out, he bought all our pelts and ears, and paid a plat apiece for them!  I can't imagine why they would be worth so much to anyone.  We were just glad to get the stinky things out of our knapsacks.<br><br>Instead of taking the short way back to Rivervale through Kithicor, we decided to take the long way back through East Karana, the Gorge, Runnyeye, then Misty Thicket.  Seemed like a good idea at the time....  Phanny had extra bloodlust that afternoon, and wanted to smite a few more creatures before we reached home.  <br><br>We chased down and killed a large spider in East Karana.  The poison dragging us down, we rested and bandaged.  Then out from nowhere this huge, deformed monster came and started screaming at us!  He was muscular in a lumpy way, wore ratty clothes, and had one huge eyeball in the center of his face.  His fists were huge, and connected with our poor poisoned bodies very easily.  Phanny and I stood up and ran in opposite directions.  He could only follow one of us, so he picked me and proceeded to beat me to a pulp.  While I took his pummelling, I tried to take a closer look at him, but he was too ugly to gaze upon for more than a few seconds. After that beast, I lost interest in East Karana and begged to go straight home.  <br><br>Just as Lemoni promised, there were boxes of goodies waiting on me in Rivervale when we arrived!  I opened them to find hundreds of wooden sticks, sharp pointy things, and feathery bits.  I also received a fletching kit (reminds me of the sewing box I don't use), a quiver and a hickory bow.  As icing on the cake, Lemoni tucked two enchanted silver rings in with the parcels.  The rings are supposed to increase my intelligence so I can learn fletching more easily.  I need all the intelligence I can get!  It isn't one of my strong suits.<br><br>I asked Marshal Lanena for a few more pointers, then settled down in front of the Fools' Gold for a stab at fletching.  After a few bungles, I made my first stack of arrows!  Then I ran to Misty Thicket to try out my new weapon.  Although the range was not as long as I had hoped, it was extremely amusing to target a bixie, draw my bow, and kill the little bugger with one arrow! <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jan 28 13:06:50 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>We are so happy!&nbsp;&nbsp;For we have finally earned the right to carry our family name into battle and across Norrath.  Bukko would have been proud of us.<br><br>We're STILL in the mines....  We met a friendly, capable group of folks down there, and proceeded to wipe a hundred more goblins off the face of Norrath.  After all this bloodshed, I don't think the Pickclaw goblins could hate us any more than they do now.  (Eh, like I respect their opinion!)<br><br>One of our party members was an Iksar shaman named Comoto.  He was tall, spindly and scaly, and to top it off his hat resembled a cow skull complete with horns.  Phanny took a liking to him almost immediately.  Comoto fell down and played dead whenever we had a few moments to spare, and she thought that was hilarious!  Even after the first dozen times he did it.  It was hard to tell if he was practicing a valuable shaman skill, or enjoying sending my sister into fits of giggles.<br><br>Comoto did assert that playing dead actually saved his life countless times.  At one point, when our numbers were low and the goblins had the advantage, he played dead while the rest of us fled upstairs.  The goblins didn't bother him at all! I wish I could play dead, too.  But when I fall down, I don't usually get back up!<br><br>Grumble grumble - another time, Anulle ran upstairs so the guards could forceably remove a couple of goblins from his back.  I followed him upstairs to help; sometimes the guards don't kill the goblins fast enough and a person can die at the guards' feet.  Unfortunately, I accidentally hit Captain Orben instead of the nearest goblin. Instead of focusing on the goblin, he started hitting me back!  I screamed, &quot;I'm sorry I'm sorry!  I didn't mean to hit--&quot; and died in the hallway.  He should have figured I was aiming for the goblin!<br><br>Phanny now wants to rest in Rivervale for a while.  I'll go back home with her; my new archery equipment will be there any day now, and I'm terribly eager to start playing with it!  I hope to meet Lemoni there this time. I have almost 80 plat to give him from all my efforts in Highpass, so he can work on his jewelcraft some more.  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jan 28 12:22:15 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>25 Warrior<br>Sands of Time - "The Red Cross of Bristlebane"</td></tr>
