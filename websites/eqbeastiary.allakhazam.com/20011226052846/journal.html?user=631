	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have read all of your posts to date and I have enjoyed them thoroughly. I would like to see more in the tale of Shrikke but, I am sure I would be most pleased with anything that you wrote. You see, I once played a Wood Elf rogue named Beofwulf on the Morrell-Thule server however, my father's computer was barely able to run it. <br>     Due to an eternity of LOADING... PLEASE WAIT, I decided I was not getting my $10.00 a month's worth. I would load so slowly that I would miss my stop on boats. I have a job now and have saved up $600.00 and am working on getting a Dell computer in the range of $850-1000. I think it is something I can handle and and something that can handle Everquest.<br>     I have missed playing very much and reading stories of Everquest, for me, has become the next best thing to actually playing the game. Many people post stories online and some, of course, are better than others but, few are as good as yours. IMHO Anyways, now that you have taken a trip on the gravy train, hopefully you will get something out of this. Thank you very much and keep up the good work scribe.<br><br><br><br>Beofwulf (at heart)<br>Rogue: 19th Coin<br>Morrell-Thule<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"Damnation is eternal.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A small apology.  I expanded the story a little bit and have included the entire Part 15. instead of just the part I added.  <br><br>This is the last of Shrkke for a bit.  I am thinking of a story line for another of my characters, so look for that in the future.<br><br>Again, I can not thank enough those who have supported the story with their comments and encouragement.  And of course...if you have any suggestions, please don't be afraid to post.<br><br>Part 15.<br><br>I could tell many stories about my time in the Test.  Battles fought, hunger, cold, the constant struggle for dominance over our environment and over each other; all of these were part of the two years that I spent as a broodling in the wilds of Kunark.  Did I learn what the Test was meant to teach?  Yes, but it was not until many years later than I understood what I had learned and what the nature of the Test was truly.  The Test, above all things, teaches the lesson of balance.  When to use violence and when to compromise, when to seek your own glory and when to sacrifice for the group, when to fight and when to hide, all these lessons of balance, most races learn once they reach adulthood.  The Iksar learn them long before we ever step outside the influence of our own land, because in reality during the life of an Iksar, the Test never ends.<br><br>Before I opened my eyes, I knew that I had passed the Test.  How you ask?    The feeling of a warm clean blanket over my skin and the mattress under my body gave it away in an instant.  I had been keeping third watch, waiting for the sun to finally come over the mountains, when suddenly; I was back among my people.  I could smell the warm food being cooked by the slaves in the kitchen.  I could hear the footsteps of other Iksars walking the halls.  I waited a long time with my eyes closed, savoring the feeling of safety that I had not felt in the last two years.  I did eventually open my eyes.  I discovered I was in a small room with a fire pit set in the wall.  A small fire was burning giving me enough light to see.   Over a chair sat a tunic I assumed was for me to wear and on the table was a pitcher of water and a washbasin.  I cleaned myself, and then put on the tunic.  I was ready for whatever was next.  I went to open the door, when I noticed something the shadows had hidden from me, my backpack.  All the items that I had called my own during the Test, where there, placed neatly in my bag.  On top was my lightstone.  I had not even noticed it had been removed from my neck.  As I picked it up and held it for a moment, a flood of memories came rushing back to me.  I recalled the excitement of learning that both the belt and the robe that we had looted from the dead Hapzass both were magical in nature.  It was also the first time I had heard the word &#8220;twink&#8221;.  I remember the day when we buried broodmates, Tursbaj and Gluzligz.  Both were casualties of another clutch running through our camp while being chased by a goblin warrior.  I remembered when hunger forced us to raid and drive out another clutch so that food would again become plentiful in our part of the valley.  I remembered Larriz.  He was sleeping soundly when I had last seen him.  Had he been taken out of the valley at the same time I had been removed?  I hoped so.  I hoped to see him again in the near future.<br><br>I put the lightstone away and closed up the backpack.  It was in some ways like putting away my childhood.  I tied the top of the bag and placed it under my bed, only to be taken out and my adventures remembered when life needed a touch of balance. <br><br> I opened the door to the torch-lit corridor to find a Crusader standing guard.  He looked down at me and almost smiled.  &#8220;Are you finally are ready to start training in earnest, broodling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to learn.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Are you sure, broodling?  I would not want to hurry you into the next stage of life prepared for you by the Lord of Fear.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to start,&#8221; I stated with just a hint of confusion in my voice.<br><br>&#8220;Well broodling, it has been my experience that most would rather start their new paths on a good foot.  I believe that means that your tunic need to be turned around the correct way.&#8221;  I looked down, and sure enough in my hurry to get out the door; I had put my tunic on backwards.  I quickly slipped it around to face the proper direction.  &#8220;Excellent, broodling.  In another couple of years, you might be able to put on your own shoes.  Come with me.  You have a meeting with Arch Duke Zog.&#8221;  I followed the Crusader down the familiar corridors of the temple.  We walked through the teleport pad to the upper levels.   The Crusader pointed to a ladder attached to the back wall.  &#8220;Climb the ladder, broodling.  At the top, the Arch Duke is waiting for you.  You must hurry.  The Arch Duke does not like being kept waiting.&#8221;<br><br>I climbed the ladder as quickly as I could.  Upon reaching the top, I could see the Arch Duke waiting on a balcony looking over our city.   However, the simple task of getting off the ladder to where I could reach Arch Duke Zog was made suddenly difficult.  The floor of the room was built so that one had to make a difficult jump from the ladder in order to reach it.  I steeled my nerve and made an attempt at jumping for the landing and was rewarded being knocked unconscious by the floor in the room below me.  I repeated this activity for the next two hours, climbing the ladder and jumping to the landing, usually taking damage in the process.  Eventually, I succeeded.  As I pulled my bruised body to the balcony, I hailed the Arch Duke and bowed.  He turned and motioned me to come closer.  As I stepped closer to the Arch Duke Zog, he took me by the shoulder and pulled me next to him where I could look over the city of Cabilis by his side.<br><br>Without taking his eyes from the city he asked me, &#8220;How are you feel, broodling.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Respectfully, Arch Duke, I feel tired and bruised.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Why do you feel tired and bruised?&#8221;<br>&#8220;The climb to meet you was difficult, more difficult, than I thought, Arch Duke.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I know you could see me standing here, broodling.  Why did you not call for help?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Arch Duke.  It seemed important that I overcome the obstacle myself.  I believed that somehow the leap from the ladder to the room was a test of whether I was worthy of speaking to you.&#8221;<br><br>Arch Duke Zog nodded slightly.  Then pointing out into Cabilis, he continued, &#8220;Broodling, what do you see out there before you?&#8221;<br><br>I looked out into in the city where Crusaders and Troopers stood guard, where groups of Frogloks under the watchful of eye of the Toilmaster re-build fallen and decayed structures, where the Kloks bought and sold goods from under their tents.  &#8220;I see my home, Arch Duke.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I see my home as well, broodling.  But I also see a people under siege who are battered and bruised from the trials of the past. A once great empire that is now a shadow of it&#8217;s former self.&#8221;  He turned suddenly looked at me, &#8220;And still our enemies seek to destroy us.   Do you know why?&#8221;  I shook my head to indicate I did not.  &#8220;Because, broodling, they fear us.  They fear our dedication to our race and culture.  They fear what each of us is willing to sacrifice in the name of our cause.  The fear what can be accomplished when a people have a clear purpose without distraction.&#8221;  He turned and looked back at the city.  &#8220;Do you know why I had the floor built so far away from the ladder, Shrikke?&#8221; <br><br>I was surprised when he used my name.  &#8220;It is a test.  To see who is worthy to speak to you.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No, broodling.  It is a reminder to every Shadowknight of Greenmist that the road to the top is often filled with painful challenges and most often those challenges must be taken on by without aid.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;So, if I had asked for help getting off the ladder&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I would have killed you.  You would have not had the spark that a true Knight of the Greenmist needs in order to succeed.  Go now&#8230;learn, fight, and understand.  Become strong and intelligent.  And above all, know that the whole of Norrath is fearful because another Iksar Shadowknight will soon walk the earth.&#8221;<br><br>Part 16.<br><br>The path to becoming a Knight of the Greenmist is long.  Before I was sent out to serve my people, I had spent five years learning at the feet of the guild masters lessons in both blade and spell.  It was on my thirteenth hatching day that I received my Pawn&#8217;s khukri and sent out to the entrance of the city to help guard my people from the creatures that roam the wilds.  <br><br>Today, the Iksar are still re-building our empire and our city.  Today we still have enemies without and within that would happily destroy our race and our way of life.  However, today, they failed to destroy us.  And today, the Iksar grew stronger.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I did not have much time to add to the story this week.  For those who are following the story, I am sorry.  I will try to add a little more sometime next week, but with Thanksgiving on the horizon, who can say :-)<br><br>On the issue of Thanksgiving...Everyone is aware of the issues that are going on in the United States.  I think that in the light of the events of Sept. 11th that we all feel a little closer to our families and each other.  I would suggest that you make known to your loved ones how you really feel about them during this season.  Tell them how thankful you are that they are a part of your life, because in the end you never know when you will never again get that chance. <br><br>Again and as always, please don't be afraid to give me comments and suggestions on this contining story.  Writing only gets better when you have critism.<br><br>Part 15.<br><br>I could tell many stories about my time in the Test.  Battles fought, hunger, cold, the constant struggle for dominance over our environment and over each other; all of these were part of the two years that I spent as a broodling in the wilds of Kunark.  Did I learn what the Test was meant to teach?  Yes, but it was not until many years later than I understood what I had learned and what the nature of the Test was truly.  The Test, above all things, teaches the lesson of balance.  When to use violence and when to compromise, when to seek your own glory and when to sacrifice for the group, when to fight and when to hide, all these lessons of balance, most races learn once they reach adulthood.  The Iksar learn them long before we ever step outside the influence of our own land, because in reality during the life of an Iksar, the Test never ends.<br><br>Before I opened my eyes, I knew that I had passed the Test.  How you ask?    The feeling of a warm clean blanket over my skin and the mattress under my body gave it away in an instant.  I had been keeping third watch, waiting for the sun to finally come over the mountains, when suddenly; I was back among my people.  I could smell the warm food being cooked by the slaves in the kitchen.  I could hear the footsteps of other Iksars walking the halls.  I waited a long time with my eyes closed, savoring the feeling of safety that I had not felt in the last two years.  I did eventually open my eyes.  I discovered I was in a small room with a fire pit set in the wall.  A small fire was burning giving me enough light to see.   Over a chair sat a tunic I assumed was for me to wear and on the table was a pitcher of water and a washbasin.  I cleaned myself, and then put on the tunic.  I was ready for whatever was next.  I went to open the door, when I noticed something the shadows had hidden from me, my backpack.  All the items that I had called my own during the Test, where there, placed neatly in my bag.  On top was my lightstone.  I had not even noticed it had been removed from my neck.  As I picked it up and held it for a moment, a flood of memories came rushing back to me.  I recalled the excitement of learning that both the belt and the robe that we had looted from the dead Hapzass both were magical in nature.  It was also the first time I had heard the word &#8220;twink&#8221;.  I remember when we buried broodmates, Tursbaj and Gluzligz, on the same day.  Both were casualties of another clutch running through our camp while being chased by a goblin warrior.  I remembered when hunger forced us to raid and drive out another clutch so that food would again become plentiful in our part of the valley.  I remembered Larriz.  He was sleeping soundly when I had last seen him.  Had he been taken out of the valley at the same time I had been removed?  I hoped so.  I hoped to see him again in the near future.<br><br>I put the lightstone away and closed up the backpack.  It was in some ways like putting away my childhood.  I tied the top of the bag and placed it under my bed, only to be taken out and my adventures remembered when life needed a touch of balance. <br><br> I opened the door to the torch-lit corridor to find a Crusader standing guard.  He looked down at me and almost smiled.  &#8220;Are you finally are ready to start training in earnest, broodling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to learn.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Are you sure, broodling?  I would not want to hurry you into the next stage of life prepared for you by the Lord of Fear.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  I am ready to start,&#8221; I stated with just a hint of confusion in my voice.<br><br>&#8220;Well broodling, it has been my experience that most would rather start their new paths on a good foot.  I believe that means that your tunic need to be turned around the correct way.&#8221;  I looked down, and sure enough in my hurry to get out the door; I had put my tunic on backwards.  I quickly slipped it around to face the proper direction.  &#8220;Excellent, broodling.  In another couple of years, you might be able to put on your own shoes.  Come with me.  You have a meeting with Arch Duke Zog.&#8221;<br><br>Happy Thanksgiving all!!<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After a number of tales, I thought it was time for a bit of a rant.  I was playing one of my favorite alternate characters, a dwarf paladin.  He has newly started his 20th season and is excited about getting rid of the damage cap and getting the Ghoulbane he welds to finally proc. <br><br>Well, without pause, I ran to the Estate of Unrest eager to make the undead of the zone completely dead once again.  Upon entering the zone I searched for a group and was invited to join a group of four in their high teens - another dwarf pally, a gnome enchanter, a druid, and a cleric.  Being the highest level character, I was asked to pull and was happy to do so.  With the Spirit of the Wolf running through my veins I started pulling the dark boned skeletons and ghouls that roam the lower level of the Estate.  I was exceptionally pleased to see the the message - "A ghoul has been hit for 137pts of non-melee damage"  I love that sword.<br><br>Anyway, after clearing the easier part of the first floor (round room and attached hall) and easily dealing the undead, I poked my little dwarf head around some of the rooms to inspect some areas in which I have less knowledge.  As you can imagine, I was soon shouting "Train to zone."  Four ghouls and a couple other skeletal types who's names I can not currently remember began chasing me out of the Estate.  I was not too concerned.  I still had SOW and the zone was fairly empty.  I could lead these creatures to zone without endangering the party at large.  I made my way out of the side door, again shouting "Train to zone."  Made my way to the point between the bush mazes to find that the creatures had stopped chasing me and were killing my party members.  They were a heroic group ...they thought I was about to be killed and came to save me.  I could not leave them to die.  So, with a LOH on the other Paladin who was almost dead and a couple of quick heals for the enchanter, I jumped into battle.  All the time, yelling for the others to run.<br><br>The outcome was not as bad as it could have been. Three of the five members made it to zone.  The enchanter and I did not survive the experience.<br><br>So as I ran back from Greater Fay, I was thinking a few things.  The first, have faith in the character that you have asked to pull...or ask someone else to pull.  Pulling creatures comes down to judgement and all good pullers know that their first job is to keep their group safe.  In the lower end game, that means when a pull goes bad that the puller leads the creatures to zone and avoids this group.  In the higher end game a bad pull basically means the puller stops in a good location for his/her corpse to be recovered.  If your puller does not know these rules, get someone else to pull.<br><br>Secondly, I thought that even though the group I was playing with could have used better judgement, that they had acted heroically and well within the spirit of roleplaying.  It was exciting fighting a battle with monsters everywhere, knowing that there was little doubt that this battle was going to end poorly.  I sometimes get tired of pulling for experience or camping for a specific item and find the real heart of the games comes from when you lay your life on the line in a seemingly hopeless battle.<br><br>I really like this game.  It allows me to talk to friends that I would normally not see regularly.  It gives me opportunity to meet new and unusual people.  It gives me a bit of an adrenalin boost that has not been as much a part of my life since my wife and I started having kids.  (My wife always thought I was nuts for wanting to ride my bike up a dirt trail, just to have the experience of riding back down at very high speeds around rocks and trees.)  <br><br>I complain as much as everyone about specific parts of this game, but where else can I get 25-30 hours of enjoyment for 10 bucks a month and stay in touch with old friends at the same time?<br><br>My final thought?  Have a good time out there. Real life has enough stress without adding stress to what is supposed to be the fun part of our lives.<br><br>Good hunting all!!!<br><br>From Parttime and his alter ego...<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Excellent Sir Parttime.  I to play a dwarf paladin on the PVP server Tallon Zek.  What you said about the bad pull is correct.  I suspect that perhaps the players you were grouped with were not high enough level yet to recognize that you were trying to pull the train away from them.  Also, I have hunted Unrest many times, and can tell you that trains from inside have a mind of their own.  Sometimes when you you pull them outside they will run in the opposite direction around the estate to chase you to the zone.  This pathing can cause the train to become larger and more dangerous; or, it can cause it to attack the group you were so valiantly trying to defend.<br><br>What I am trying to say is that Unrest is a dangerous zone where stuff like this happens all the time.  Look at the good side.  You died after using your lay on hands and healing and brawling, allowing most of your party to escape alive.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Oh, mightest of the self proclaimed lords of the green, smelly, butt iching types...<br><br>It has been known for many seasons that the armies, lead by Innoruuk, have been gathering.  And do not fear, my fellow Iksars and I will be more than happy to stand still and wait for your (What did you call it?  Oh..yes.)  Your "Great Offensive(tm)" to come wandering into our lands.  Actually, we thank you for bringing our past slaves and servants back to us, instead of us having to extend our reach and dragging them back from the ill fated life they live in "Da Swamp".<br><br>Trolls don't make the best slaves but could be considered amusing in a "Look, that troll has his finger stuck in his nose" sort of way.  Plus, make excellent fertilizer when ground up properly.<br><br>Dragons, Giants, and our own creations have waged war to wipe the Iksar from the face of Norrath.  I'm assuming that a bunch of liquored up, green, pimply butted trolls will be more of an afternoon tea party, then a real war.<br><br>And if you want to know fear, I would suggest you consider what happened to your kind the last time your failed your god.  He turned you into the gelatenous blobs you are today.  And to add insult to injury, turned your woman into the third...behind female ogers and dwarfs...ugliest creatures on the planet.  No wonder your race is so hostile.<br><br>I welcome your kind to my continent of Kunark.  Please come over and pick up your maid uniform anytime you like.<br><br>With all due respect and in the tradition of the rant...<br><br>/ooc I'm assuming this is a fun bantering of words.  Pusbag, I have enjoyed your posts over the last year.  Please feel free to post here anytime you like.  Your particular sense of gaming is refreshing :-)<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I don't have time to proof this copy...sorry for the mistakes.  I need to get home or my wife will make it so I will need a rez. in real life.  Have a good weekend all.<br><br>Part 14.<br><br>Chasnic and Zzrantan both disappeared one night about a moon after the scale wolves attacked our camp.  Larriz and I did not see them go to say our farewells.   We assumed the Testmaster had determined they had passed the Test and where ready to start their lives serving the Emperor as the will of Cazic Thule dictated.  I was pleased to find Zzrantan&#8217;s mace, which I had originally found on the body of a dead shaman, leaning up against a tree where he had been standing watch.  It was a good weapon compared to the dagger that I wore on my hip.  I offered Larriz the dagger.  He declined the offer, saying that he would rather depend on the strength of his own hands, then the weakness of steal.  Monks, in my opinion, are an odd bunch.<br><br>We adjusted to the change as best we could, considering there were only two of us left in the clutch.  Battling creatures became, essentially, more of an exercise of avoidance than of confrontation.  The lack of fresh meat made both of us rely more heavily on our foraging skills than we had previously.  Also, the possibility of a raid from another clutch became a more likely event with only the two of us left.<br><br>Luck served Larriz and myself well in the avoidance of succumbing to such a raid and provided us the opportunity to join another clutch.  It was twenty days since Chasnic and Zzrantan had disappeared in the night.  Larriz and I were doing what we did every moment we were not guarding or sleeping.  We were trying to find food for the day.  In coming down the path to our camp with a bag full of roots that we had managed to dig up by the stream, Larriz poked me and pointed down at the trail.  In the dust could clearly see the foot and tail prints of a number of Iksar heading towards our camp.  Larriz and I quickly stepped off the trail and headed quietly towards our camp.  I must admit that Larriz was much better at traveling silently.  It seemed that every time I moved a leaf rustled or a twig snapped.  Larriz on the other hand moved so quietly that at times I would simply lose track of him.  Nevertheless, we arrived at a hill over looking our camp without being noticed and in time to see a group of five Iksars going through our camp.  They seemed upset, probably because no food could be found.  We could hear who seemed to be the leader of the clutch, a smallish Iksar wearing a robe and holding a staff, yelling and pointing at different locations around the camp directing each broodlings to search in places where food may be hidden.  They did not realize that all the food we had was in the bag sitting next to me.<br><br>It was a long time before they gave up their search.  After much discussion they decided that we must have some hidden stash of supplies somewhere and the best way to get those supplies was to capture us.  Larriz and I had decided that we had two choices.  The first, to simply disappear until they left and make due without the bedding and other supplies they would surely steal.  The other choice was to try to convince them to let us join their clutch.  The first option had little short-term risk, but would result in some serious long-term problems.  The second choice was dangerous at the moment, but if successful gave us the protection of a clutch once again.  There is a saying:  Better to fight the dragon you know is at the gate, then to ignore it and be surprised when he returns.  The dragon, in this case, was the leader of this clutch.  <br><br>We watched the other broodling hide themselves around our camp, trying to determine the best way to present ourselves to them.  We noted with some humor that the leader of the clutch had placed himself as far away from where battle was likely to start has he could.  Shaking our heads, Larriz and I sat on the hill above our camp eating the roots we had found discussing possible methods of dealing with this current problem.  In the course of that discussion, we came upon a plan.   And according to the plan, I needed to take hostage the largest broodling in the other clutch.  I did not say it was a good plan.<br><br>I crawled through the underbrush towards where the broodling that Larriz and I had come to the conclusion was most likely the main warrior of the group.  She had placed herself near the path entrance to our camp, I&#8217;m assuming to ambush us and cut off our line of escape once we that entered our camp.  I moved slowly from bush to tree with dagger in hand.  Did I mention that stealth was not one of my greatest strengths?  It took me quite a while to finally get in position where I could easily subdue the broodling when the forest itself betrayed me.  A light breeze ran through the forest just as I was about to place my dagger at the throat of the other broodling.  She turned to watch the leaves rustle and out of the corner of her eye, saw me coming up behind her.  I lunged at her hoping to knock her to the ground before he could get her weapon pointed at me.  I partially succeed.  I did knock her to the ground, but she drew a line of blood from my neck beneath my ear and along the line of jaw in whipping her short sword around.  Luckily, I pinned her arm to her body before she could reverse the blade.  We rolled together in the leaves of the forest, one of us trying to get an opening.  Cazic Thule was with me.  I ended up on top and managed to bring the hilt of the dagger down upon her skull, stunning her for a moment.  Unsure how long she would remain stunned I hit her again.  After the second strike, her body went limp.  I looked up to the forest around me.  I was in danger.  The scuffle had not gone unnoticed by the other broodlings who were quickly coming my direction.<br><br>&#8220;Stop!!  Everyone stop!!&#8221; I yelled.  &#8220;Or she dies.&#8221;  I could see the other broodlings stop with their weapons in hand.  I rolled the unconscious broodling closer to the path and into a more open area.  &#8220;I and another want to join your clutch,&#8221; I said to them.  &#8220;Who leads you?  I would talk to the leader.&#8221;<br><br>A voice came from the brush on the other side of the camp from where I held my hostage.  &#8220;I lead this clutch,&#8221; said the small Iksar in the robe as he stood on a rock to see over the top of the foliage what had transpired.  He made no movement toward where I held my prisoner.  &#8220;I say who belongs and who does not belong.  I am Hapzass.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Hapzass, I and my clutchmate would join your group.  The Testmaster has taken two of our clutch and then left us without others to help.  My clutchmate is wounded in the woods and I now hunt alone.&#8221;  Stopping for a breath, &#8220;I am quick and resourceful as this proves.  I would be able to pull my own weight and my clutchmate would be a great asset when he is mended.  What say you?  Quickly, please.  I do not want to battle this one again.  Do not force me to kill her.&#8221;  I pressed the dagger against the fallen broodlings throat.<br><br>&#8220;Kill her and save me the trouble.  She has failed and I will not tolerate failure in my clutch.  Or do you not have the stomach to kill, pup?&#8221;  Hapzass smiled at me.  &#8220;You are not in the position of strength you thought.  You did not think I was willing to sacrifice one of those within the clutch?  Unfortunate for you.&#8221;  He motioned at the other broodlings, &#8220;Kill them both.&#8221;<br><br>I looked at the broodling who had their weapons drawn.  They looked at me with my dagger against the throat of the fallen Iksar.  One of them turned to Hapzass and spoke, &#8220;He will kill her Hapzass.  We have room for one more.  You are being shortsighted.&#8221;  <br><br>&#8220;Are you questioning me, Gluzligz?&#8221;  Pulling his staff closer to him body.  &#8220;Do you think you can question my authority?  I am leader by right of power.&#8221;  The staff began to glow a little.<br><br>Gluzligz bowed his head and spread his hands.  &#8220;No, Hapzass.  I do not question your right to lead, only your decision in this instance.  We could take this one into the clutch easily.&#8221;<br><br>Hapzass snorted, &#8220;Foolish broodling.  We do not need another with my power&#8230;especially this one.  Shadowknights are pretenders of my art.  Kill them or I will do it myself.&#8221;  The staff he held began to glow brighter.<br><br>How did he know I was bound to the path of the Knights of Fear?  It was a question I did not know the answer to for a very long time.<br><br>Gluzligz turned back to me, &#8220;Please do not kill her.  She is my sister and a good warrior.  We can take you into our clutch.  I&#8217;m sorry we can&#8217;t take you both, but our food supply can only feed six.  You understand?&#8221;<br><br>I looked at Gluzligz and smiled.  &#8220;I understand, Gluzligz.  If your camp can only hold six then six it will be, broodling.&#8221;  I pressed the knife harder against the fallen female&#8217;s throat and Gluzligz&#8217; face went pale.<br><br>Hapzass screamed, &#8220;Shut up, Gluzligz!!  This is my clutch.  I hold the power here.  You will not&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>It was at that moment that Larriz stepped out of bushes behind Hapzass and calmly caved in his skull with my mace.  The leader crumpled to the ground without a sound.  Larriz struck again and yet again to make sure the broodling was dead.  At the sound of metal hitting flesh all three broodlings from the other clutch spun around and watched with open mouths as the life of the leader of their clutch came to an abrupt end.  Larriz stood up from finishing the task and waved at me with a big grin across his face.<br><br>The three broodling spun back towards me, weapons at the ready.  I smiled and stood up, removing my dagger from the throat of the fallen broodling.  &#8220;Gluzligz, you did say only six?  Correct?&#8221;<br><br>Gluzligz looked confused for a moment and then broke into a smile.  &#8220;Yes.  Yes I did.&#8221;<br><br>The other two broodling began to understand the nature of the event and everyone began to relax then Larriz broke the silence with a startled cry.  &#8220;Shrikke, the staff this piece of froglok dug was holding, I went to pick it up and it disappeared out of my hands.&#8221;<br><br>Gluzligz eyes went wide.  He spun around and yelled at Larriz, &#8220;Get everything off his body&#8230;quickly.&#8221;  <br><br>Larriz started looting the corpse as quickly as he could.  He had managed to get the belt and robe off of the dead broodling when suddenly blue lines of power exploded from the corpse with a blinding flash.  There was a bright flash of light and a quiet popping sound.  With that the corpse was gone.  Larriz walked out from behind the bushes rubbing his eyes with one hand and holding the robe and belt of Hapzass over the other.  &#8220;I got these,&#8221; indicating the robe and belt.  &#8220;But what in the name Cazic Thule&#8217;s claws what that?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It was a gate spell, broodlings.&#8221;  The Testmaster appeared as he walked out of the forest.  &#8220;Someone has gated the corpse of Hapzass out of the valley.  Someone has interfered with the outcome of the test.  Someone will soon be answering to me.&#8221;  He paced around where the corpse had fallen.  &#8220;They break with tradition and the will of the Emperor.  This must not be.&#8221;  He must have been talking to himself for as he spoke he never looked at any of us.  After a few moments more of muttering and swearing, the Testmaster stopped suddenly looked at all of us.  &#8220;Get back to your camp.  Shrikke. Larriz. Gather your belongings and go.  I have no need for you all getting in my way.&#8221;<br><br>We hurried and gathered our bedding and cooking supplies out of our shelter.  We stepped out ready to travel to our new camp in time to witness the Testmaster heal the fallen broodling.   She was confused, but held her tongue until we were out of earshot of the Testmaster.  She then made us stop our travels until we explained fully the events of the day.  Her name was Tursbaj.  After a complete explanation she looked me then Larriz over.  Then turned back to me.  &#8220;If you had said you where going to kill Hapzass, I wouldn&#8217;t have fought so hard.  Let&#8217;s go.  It&#8217;s getting late and we need to find dinner.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here is the lastest.  I want to send out a special thanks to Mugali and the Honorable tochail for the encouragement.  And although I doubt Verant will ever drop me a line to ask for creative assistance, I am honored that you appriciate my words and this story.<br><br>I hope you enjoy the next installment.  And again, don't be afraid to post your thoughts on how to improve the story :-)  Have a good week all.<br><br>Part 13.<br><br>The Iksar have few holidays.  And unlike most peoples, those holidays we do observe are not in remembrance of the Iksar when we were at our best.  We do not set apart days of celebration to pay tribute to a victorious battle or to the hatching day of a powerful leader or even to the memory of our god.  We chose instead to celebrate our defeats.  The day Emperor Rile&#8217;s fleet was destroyed is a holy day.  The day that our race was chased out of Chardok by our own creations is day that we come together to celebrate.  Why is this you ask?  The reason is simple.  Our past victories have taught our race nothing.  Only in times of defeat has our race become truly wiser.  Only when our weaknesses have been exposed and our deeds have been crushed along with our hopes upon ground have the Iksar grown as a race.  We celebrate these days of failure so that we will not forget our weakness and continue to dedicate ourselves to not repeating our mistakes.<br><br>Our small group survived the next couple of moons with few incidents.  Chasnic and Zzrantan taught Larriz and I how to forage food from our surrounding and to recognize the difference between the creatures we could conquer and those who would certainly end our lives.  They did not do this out of compassion, but out of a need for us to be members that would contribute to the continued welfare of the clutch and eventually whose judgment they could trust in a fight.  We tried not to disappoint them.<br><br>The clutch was not again tested again until one evening when Zzrantan was on watch.  I was awakened by the sharp sound of a stone coming through the open window and ricocheting against the back wall.  Instantly awake and knowing that Zzrantan had thrown the stone to alert us to some danger, I sat up in bed with the three other broodling listening for a hint of danger before running out to meet it.  As I sat on my sleeping mat, a sound could be heard, just on the edge of perception like the cry of a child.  Chasnic must have heard it as well because he quietly swore.<br><br>&#8220;Shrikke, you and Larriz, gather wood.  Now!  We don&#8217;t have much time before the pack gets here.  And try to be quiet.  Maybe they will pass by&#8230;maybe.&#8221;  Larriz and I scrambled out off of our mats and headed out of the hut.  Upon exiting, we saw that Zzrantan was already trying to get a fire started.   Chasnic on the other hand simply came out of the hut, stood in the middle of camp and sniffed the air and listened to the noise that had grown loud enough for me to understand the danger&#8230;scaled wolves.<br><br>Zzrantan spoke to us as he struck iron to flint, trying to get a spark to alight.  &#8220;It is not a mature pack that comes our way, but a litter that has just been chased out of its den, I think.  Fire will keep them at bay, if I can get it started before they reach our camp.&#8221;  Larriz and I hastily moved the wood that we had gathered for the morning to where Zzrantan was desperately trying to give life to a flame that would save our lives.<br><br>Chasnic sniffed the air a couple more times and pulled his weapon from its sheath.  &#8220;Hurry, Zzran.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I know&#8230;I know,&#8221; spoke Zzrantan as he struck the steel to the flint over and over again.  Moments pasted and the yips and barks from the pack could be heard clearly when finally one of the sparks started to produce smoke.  &#8220;Almost there&#8230;just a few more moments.&#8221;  From the smoke the hint of a flame could be seen moving it&#8217;s way through the pieces of bark and pine needles Zzrantan had used for kindling.   We all moved around Zzrantan and around the fire pit with our weapons drawn, facing out into the darkness again, waiting the beasts to show themselves.  I saw the first hint of a true flame glinting off the darting eyes of Chasnic who stood beside me when the first attack came.<br><br>The scaled wolf pup came out of the forest at a full run past me and towards the fire pit.  I turned to block the wolf and protect our small fire when a second beast, following closely behind the first, leapt out of the darkness, blindsided me and knocked me to the ground.  The first wolf avoided the small flame burning within our fire pit and headed back to the darkness of the forest, but not without Chasnic and Larriz landing a couple of glancing blows on the pup.  The second pup did not slow down after knocking me to my back, but continued over the top of my form and directly through the small fire. Scattering it and the rest of the fuel into small bits of glowing wood.  As I tried to get back to my feet, I heard a thud, a snap and a sharp yip as Zzrantan&#8217;s mace found the wolf&#8217;s passing form and broke it&#8217;s spine.   As I looked up and saw the struggling pup trying to get up, I knew that our group was just as damaged and paralyzed as the broken wolf without the fire that now lay in small, scattered flames about the fire pit.<br><br>I stood up with my small dagger in front of me.  At least twenty of the creatures now ringed our small camp.  Growling and short barks could be heard from all around.  &#8220;Chasnic, is it the light or the heat that the wolves fear?&#8221; I asked.<br><br>&#8220;The wolves are night hunters.  They do not like the light a fire shines,&#8221; he replied with a voice tight with fear.<br><br>I dropped my weapon and placed my hands to the crystal hanging around my throat.   I had not practiced with the stone around my neck since I had started the Test.  Would I be able to find the lines of force before the wolves charged in mass.  I heard Chasnic and Zzrantan yell at me, then the sound of the wolves rushing into the camp.  I found the force just as the first wolf landed on my chest, again knocking me to the ground.  As my head hit the dirt the light from the stone burst forth from the stone.  I passed out.<br><br>I know that I was unconscious for half a day.  I awoke with light streaming into our hut with my clutchmates standing around talking about what they would do if I did not wake up.<br><br>I sat up slowly, &#8220;We must have won?&#8221;  They turned to me as one with surprise in their eyes.<br><br>Chasnic almost smiled,  &#8220;We did, although you will have to tell us how, exactly. &#8220;<br><br>I told them about the stone my teacher had given me.  About how she had taught me how with concentration I could make the stone shine.  But, unfortunately, doing so took away all my energy.<br><br>Chasnic slapped me on the side of the head, no so gently.  &#8220;Well don&#8217;t do it again unless you tell us.  It&#8217;s a good thing the wolf pups left; because we were all mostly blind after your little show.  I&#8217;m still seeing spots.&#8221;<br><br>They let me rest for the day until my strength had returned a bit.  We ate well.  Scaled wolf is excellent, if you are hungry enough. <br><br>I sat third watch that night.  As I gazed into the blackness listening for the sound of goblins and lone scale wolves, the Testmaster suddenly appeared in front of me.  &#8220;I&#8217;m very surprised,&#8221; he started, &#8220;that your clutch is still alive.  How did your clutch kill the goblin, Shrikke?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;There was no goblin here, Testmaster.  Our clutch was attacked by a pack of scale wolves last evening.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Scale wolves?  But scale wolves do not use magic, young Shrikke.  If it was not a goblin, then who exactly used magic this last evening?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I did Testmaster.  I was given a&#8230;&#8221;  He stopped me with a wave of his hand.<br><br>&#8220;I do not want to know,&#8221; the Testmaster stated closing his eyes and shaking his head.  &#8220;The use of power is not forbidden in the Test, but it is a rare thing for reasons that you may not be aware of right now.  Have you studied with the Necromancers by any chance?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No, Testmaster.  Squire Mharkas has been teaching me to meditate since I was two seasons from hatching,&#8221; I said.<br><br>&#8220;Squire Mharkas is foolish, Shrikke.  She puts you and herself in danger, too much danger if you favor my opinion.&#8221;  Looking around the dark forest the Testmaster began to speak words of power and fade away.  &#8220;Good hunting, Shrikke.  I have other problems to deal with tonight.&#8221;  With that, he was gone.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To those reading this series of posts...my thanks for your encouragement.  I have again put fingers to keyboard (since my boss has left early anyway) and have continued the humble beginnings of our friendly Iksar Shadowknight.<br><br>Please don't be afraid of making comments and suggestions or pointing out issues of lore that maybe be problematic.  Good weekend all.<br><br>Part. 12<br><br>Squire Mharkas did pack enough food for a meal.  I did not eat much of it, my stomach was jittery thinking about what the night could bring, but that did not stop the rest of my clutch from eating a hardy meal.  In between mouthfuls of food each told me a little of their history.  Chasnic was the oldest of broodlings.  His father was a warrior and his mother, a shaman of the Lord of Fear.  He figured that he had maybe two moons until the he had passed the test and returned home.  I asked him what path he would follow, his mother&#8217;s or his father&#8217;s.  He was not sure. <br><br>Zzrantan by his own statement was a warrior.  His mother was a warrior.  His father was a warrior.  His father&#8217;s line had been warriors from the time Emperor Rile had ruled the land.  I believed it.  He was big and strong, but not given to much creative thinking.  This is not saying that all warriors are not creative, but intellect is not necessarily the attribute that warriors tend to cultivate.  <br><br>If it was obvious that Zzrantan&#8217;s path was that of a warrior, it was more apparent that Larriz&#8217;s path was that of a monk.  Slightly smaller than even me, but with movements that where coordinated and flowing, it was apparent that the Court of Pain would have another lethal member of it&#8217;s society, if we survived the night.  Larriz had become a part of the clutch only a fortnight ago, but he had found his place in this group as scout and lookout.<br><br>What would be my role in this small group, I thought?  Only time would tell.<br><br>In the pack, as well as the food, were a couple complete changes of cloths, a blanket, a small shovel for camp hygiene, a pot and my burnout lightstone.  The Squire had attached the lightstone to a leather strap that could be hung around the neck.  I quickly tied the lightstone around my neck, and tucked the stone under my tunic remembering the Squire&#8217;s comment that the stone could be a blessing or a curse in my future.<br><br>The meal was quickly over.  I, along with everyone else, began gathering wood and rocks for the night to come.  My trips back and forth in search for weapons gave me an idea of my surroundings.  Our camp was placed in a slight bend in the stream.  The stream wasn&#8217;t large enough to provide any protection, but someone would have to move fairly quietly not to be noticed coming across it.  Preparations where complete for the evening just as the night became truly dark.  I was informed that usually everyone sits guard once per night, but because of the possible danger, everyone was going to spend the night awake.  Each broodling hidden themselves around the camp looking out into the darkness in a different direction.  I got to watch the stream, being that it was the easiest direction to cover.  So, with the dagger firmly in one hand and a pile of large stones next to me, I started my first night of the Test peering into the darkness of the forest awaiting the coming of chaos.<br><br>I waited a long time.  The nighttime sounds where unfamiliar, but none of the other broodlings seemed to be concerned.  As the night continued, I relaxed.  Maybe my clutch mates where wrong.  Maybe nothing would happen tonight.  I do not remember when I fell asleep, but I do remember hearing Zzrantan&#8217;s crying out the alarm.  I woke up with a start, my hand on my dagger and my heart beating wildly.  I spun in the direction of Zzrantan&#8217;s cry to see a skeletal shape walking into our camp.  The figure walked in a straight line, apparently unaware of the four of us.  Chasnic yelled out for everyone to hold their positions.  The skeleton walked to the fire pit in front of our tent and stopped as if it was warming the flesh it did not anymore possess.  Suddenly the creature turned and headed directly towards Larriz&#8217;s position.  How had it sensed Larriz?  I learned later, that the undead had an uncalculated amount of hatred for the living.  That hatred seems to bestow the undead with an uncanny sense.<br><br>The skeleton moved toward Larriz with speed and purpose and Larriz followed suit, running away from the spectral entity.  I could hear Larriz screaming for help as he wound his way through the trees.  Even with Larriz speed, the skeleton was quickly making up ground on the broodling.  Chasnic and Zzrantan both yelled instructions to the fleeing Larriz.  I heard enough of their instructions to know that they wanted Larriz to get back to camp.  I believe Larriz heard them as well, because moments later he came running into camp, the skeleton on his heels.  The skeleton was about to pummel the small broodling in the middle of camp, when a stone came flying out of the darkness, striking the skeleton on the side of the head.  The skeleton backhanded the running Larriz, sending him flying across the camp, then stopped and turn towards me.  I threw that rock?  Squire Mharkas would not be impressed with me.  It was foolish to have the taunted the creature, when I was the least prepared to deal with it.<br><br>As the skeleton turned towards me and started moving out of the camp in my direction, two forms converged on it.  Zzrantan with my mace in his hand swung an overhand blow that cracked the arm off the skeleton. Chasnic struck a blow to the creature&#8217;s leg that connected, but did not seem to do much damage.  The skeleton forgot about me completely and swung its one remaining arm around in a roundhouse that struck Zzrantan solidly in his ribs.  The broodling sagged under the blow, but did not fall, and again swung his mace.   The mace struck the skeleton again, this time collapsing the ribcage.  And again Chasnic swung his dagger.  This time the leg snapped and the rest of the creature fell to the ground in a heap.   Zzrantan struck the skeleton a couple more time for good measure as Chasnic headed over the still form of Larriz.  Chasnic rolled the Larriz onto his back and shook the fallen broodling.  I heard Larriz moan and Chasnic helped the wounded Larriz onto his feet.  Chasnic then started to explain a couple of tactical concepts to the young Iksar.  The most important of which is that running around in circles makes it impossible for your clutchmates to help you and in the future, if a creature was attacking, that the appropriate course of action was to either stand and fight, or run to where your clutch can help you, then stand still and fight. <br><br>We all went back to our positions, peering into the blackness of the forest. And I did not have any problems staying awake.  Two other skeletons walked past our camp, but not close enough to sense our little group.  All was quiet, when I heard the shouting.  Someone or something was heading our direction.  As it got closer, I could hear it crashing through the undergrowth, yelling at the top of its lungs.  I picked up a rock in one hand, not sure of what was about to happen.  As the creature got closer, I could tell that it was shouting for help in Iksar.  Chasnic heard the shouting as well and told everyone to hold positions.  Out of the brush and splashing through the stream came another broodling.  He had blood flowing over his face from a slash over his eye.  His clothes where ripped and slashed, either from a battle or from his flight through the woods.  I watched as he entered our camp and fell to his knees in exhaustion.  He shouted that he needed help, that a skeleton had destroyed his whole clutch and was chasing him.  Chasnic stepped into the center of the camp and walked over to the young Iksar.  Chasnic asked the broodling to which clutch he had belonged.  The broodling told him, but added that everyone was dead.  Chasnic asked the broodling to describe the skeleton, quickly.  The broodling gave a description of a skeleton well over three arm spans tall, with bones covered in scales.  Chasnic nodded his head and placed his hand on the broodling&#8217;s shoulder.   The broodling looked up with some hope, thinking that he had been saved.  He never saw Chasnic&#8217;s dagger as it entered his chest and punched his heart.  The gleam faded away from the broodlings eyes and Chasnic laid the young Iksar on the ground.<br><br>He told everyone to stay alert, especially for a large skeleton coming towards camp.  And he added that if we heard him yell to run, that we where to run without looking back.  He then left and returned to his own hiding place to again watch the night.<br><br>Eventually, the morning did come and Chasnic told everyone to come out from hiding.  We all looked the worse for wear.  Zzrantan was still favoring his one side a lttle where the skeleton had struck him and the bruise above Larriz eye was nto quite completely healed.  Chasnic and I had not taken any real damage, but where very tired.   Zzrantan moved the corpse of the dead broodling to the edge of the camp and we all sat down around the fire.<br><br>It was a hard night and no one was talkative, but I had to ask the question, &#8220;Why did you kill him, Chasnic?  I thought we where short a member?  Was it just because he was from another clutch?  I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;<br><br>Chasnic looked at me and almost smiled, &#8220;No, I did not kill him because he was from another clutch.  I would not kill another broodling simply because of where he lived in the valley.&#8221;  He sighed.  &#8220;His clutch had attacked or been attacked by what sounded like a scalebone skeleton.  The creature was too powerful for his clutch to defeat and was definitely too strong for our group to deal with adequately.   That skeleton, if it were following him, would have walked right into our camp and destroyed him and us.  I merely hasten the death that was already assured and lessened the possibility of our own.  We barely survived the decayed skeleton&#8217;s attack.  Anything more powerful and we would have joined the undead in their next walk through the valley.&#8221;<br><br>I nodded in acceptance.  &#8220;Chasnic, I have one other question.  Do you know the location of this broodling&#8217;s clutch?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes.  It is not too far from here,&#8221; stated Chasnic.<br><br>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m guessing that we need to loot what we can off this one and head over to the other camp and see if the skeleton has provided us with some extra supplies before any other clutch relies what has happened.  Correct?&#8221;<br><br>Zzrantan laughed.  &#8220;Exactly.  Welcome to the Test, Shrikke.&#8221;<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings again.  I'm sorry I have not posted in a while.  RL and work gets busy and sucks up my EQ time.<br><br>The next installment of Shrikke's Bio.  I need to wrap this up I think or it will become a book unto itself :-)<br><br>Thanks again for praise and encouragement.  Please feel free to comment or suggest.<br><br>Part 10.<br><br>Life without purpose is worthless.  Find a being without purpose and you have found nothing.  Find a purpose without a being and you have found opportunity.  Truly, all other races on Norrath hate the Iksar.  Even the Dark Elves who celebrate death, torture and bloodshed will generally not deal with those of my kind.  There is a reason for this.  The Iksar can be expected to do exactly what will suit the purpose of continued existence for our race without hesitation, emotion or thought of sacrifice.  If that means the death of an innocent or a thousand innocents or entire race, that is acceptable as long as the Iksar advance in power.  However, we do not enjoy such practices in and of themselves.  We do not glorify in the death of another.  Death is a tool.  Fear is a tool.  We use tools to build our future; we do not let the tools dictate that future. <br><br>I do not remember coming to the wilderness from my home with Squire Mharkas.  I do not remember how I got a large bump on my head.  I was told once that often trauma to the head can cause the loss of memory.  I do remember beginning to regain consciousness and my head throbbing when a great river of power flashed through my body.  I was instantly awake and alert.  My eyes opened to an adult Iksar who I had never seen standing over the top of me wearing a blue robe with a mace hanging on his belt.  He said nothing to me, but stood up, turned and walked into the dark forest.  He then began to speak quietly to another I had not seen, standing under the darkness of a tree.   I could not make out their words, so I started looking around trying to judge exactly where I was and what exactly was going to happen.  It was dark just before dawn.  The world around me was a mixture of trees and ebon hues.  The Iksar in blue robes nodded his head and began to walk away into the forest.  He had not taken twenty steps when there was thrum of a longbow from the direction of silhouette behind the tree.  I turned, to see an arrow lodged at the base of the skull of the blue robed Iksar.  He slumped face first onto the forest floor with hardly a sound.  I reacted by backing quickly into the shrubbery behind me hoping that I was not the next target.<br><br>The shadow behind the tree stepped out into the clearing as he concentrated on unstringing his bow.  It was an old Iksar, slightly bent with age.  He finished with his bow and looked around the clearing until his gaze fell upon the shrub where I was desperately trying to become one with the fauna.  &#8220;Come out broodling.  Your death will not come by my hand today.&#8221;<br><br>I slowly made my way out of the bushes, my gaze never leaving the old lizard.  &#8220;Why did you have to kill that one?&#8221; indicating the dead Iksar.<br><br>&#8220;It is the rules.  No one may know where the Test is conducted, except for myself and the leaders of each of the major guilds.  Any who happen upon this place by accident must be killed.  And any who are sent here on purpose are meant to be tested.  That one failed.&#8221;  The old Iksar pointed toward the bundle prepared for me by Squire Mharkas.  &#8220;Take your pack.  And keep up, the camp is a short ways away.&#8221;<br><br>I grabbed my bag and turned to see the old one already making progress through the dark undergrowth.  I would have to hurry to catch up, not having any idea where this place was located, or how to find my way back to my home if I got lost but I needed something from the dead Iksar.  I sprinted over to the body and grabbed the mace that still hung from the Iksars&#8217; belt.  I could not see it going to waste here in the forest.  With the mace in one hand and my bundle over my shoulder I ran to catch the old one.  For a moment I thought he had lost me.  In time, I spotted him ahead and managed to keep him in sight until I finally caught up with him.  He did not say anything about the mace although I am sure he knew from where I had gotten it.  He moved easily for an ancient one.  Age did not seem to hinder his movements through the woods as I nearly ran to keep up with him.<br><br>The rays of the sun where just beginning to stream over the tops of the mountains, giving the forest a tint of purple, when the old Iksar held his arm straight out to the side as an indication for me to stop.  My question was halted with a motion.  &#8220;Move behind that tree and do not move until I come for you, broodling,&#8221; he whispered.  I quickly made my way behind the tree and looked back the way I had came in time to see the old one with a motion of power gather the shadows of the forest around him and disappear.  He was a Knight of Shadow, like Squire Mharkas.<br><br>I waited quietly behind the tree, holding my newfound mace tightly with both hands, listening to the sounds of the early morning forest.  Each sound I heard making me suspect a hidden threat.   I spent until the sun was clearly above the mountains jumping each time a bird would take wing or rabbit would run for cover.  Eventually, as the morning passed and the old Iksar did not return, I grew tired of jumping and started enjoying the forest scene around me.  With my back to the tree and the warm morning sun shining warmly on my green scales, I started to dose.<br><br>I awoke with a start with a knife pressed up against my throat.  Three Iksars about my own age or a little older stood in front of me, while a fourth held the knife firmly under my chin.   The one holding the knife spoke, &#8220;What clutch are you with, broodling.&#8221;  I hesitated to answer.  I did now know what he was talking about.  Seeing my hesitation, the largest of the three in front of me pulled a dagger from her belt.  &#8220;We do not have time for dealing with this problem.  Sorry broodling, the Test is over for you.&#8221;  And with that, she lunged forward, trying to sink the knife into my belly for a quick kill.  I moved.  Luckily the one holding the knife to my throat seemed just as surprised at the abrupt attack as I and also jumped away.  Luckily, he managed to miss cutting my throat as I twist around the tree and away from the incoming knife.   Instead of the knife burying itself in my stomach, I felt the blade force itself through my scales and into my flesh along my ribs.  I would have made it behind the tree and hopefully into a full run if not for something getting caught between my feet.  Instead, as I dove around the tree and out of the way, I tripped and fell headlong into ball of arms, legs, and tail.  Cursing and thinking that death was just a few steps behind me, I reached down to remove the object that, even as I tumbled, was hampering my escapes.   My hand fell upon my looted mace.  Hearing the others coming towards me, I grabbed the mace with both hands, got me feet under me, and as I heard one of them coming up behind me, I stood up swinging the mace in a full circle.  I had never killed another being before.  I had seen many slaves and prisoner killed, but had never killed anyone myself.  The mace came into contact with the skull of the closest pursuer.  There was a sound of metal hitting bone and the young Iksar fell to the ground in a mass of blood and scale.  The weight of the mace spun me around even after the blow.   I tried to quickly bring the mace back to face my enemies.  When I did, they stood two arm lengths away from me, holding their own weapons, but they where not looking at me, but behind me.  I cautiously looked over my shoulder to see the old Iksar standing off to the side and behind me.<br>	&#8220;A poor showing, broodlings,&#8221; talking to the three young Iksars.  &#8220;This one should be dead if you had worked together.  However, may I be so bold as to suggest that you consider attacking an enemy instead of the newest member of your clutch?&#8221;  The others dropped the tips of their weapons and started looking at the ground in shame or frustration.  &#8220;Now you are again short two members.  It will be a difficult year, I think.&#8221;  The other three broodlings looked at me, then at the body of their fallen companion.  The old one continued, &#8220;The broodling doesn&#8217;t have a name yet, but considering what just occurred, I think we shall call him Shrikke.&#8221;<br><br>Part 11.<br><br>The Test of Sufficiency is a period between a broodling&#8217;s sixth and eighth season when a broodling is taken out to the wilds of Kunark, placed with a clutch of other young Iksars and left to endure.  Food, water, shelter and safety are in questionable supply during those years.   Young Iksars must learn to not only forage from the forest all they need to survive during the two years, but also be prepared to protect themselves and their clutch from the wandering creatures of the area and the intrusion of other clutches.   <br><br>The Test, from what I could discern, is held in a very large, round valley with only one pass.  The Testmaster, the ancient Iksar who introduced me to my clutch, guards the pass.  His responsibility was to regulate the types and numbers of creatures that entered the valley and to place candidates into clutches when they began the Test.   His greatest challenge seemed to be keeping balance within the valley.  Balance between the creatures of the area and the various clutches camped around the valley.   Too many creatures or creatures possessing too much power would simply overrun the clutches, too few creatures would limit the opportunity for each clutch to work together and be tested effectively.   In all things of the valley, the Testmaster was ultimately responsible.<br><br>How the Test came into existence is unknown to me. I would guess that the guild leaders may have some of the lore concerning the Test, but I have not asked and I doubt they would freely give such information.<br><br>And so, I found myself with three other Iksar broodlings wondering the wilds of Kunark.  It seems that I had &#8220;accidentally&#8221; killed the oldest and strongest of the broodlings and at the same time interrupted a raid that the clutch had planned upon another nearby group.  The broodling I had killed was named Ysshis.  She had wished to become a trooper and train at the Guild of Warriors after the Test.  Instead, the group looted her body, gave me the clothing, and buried it with their own claws so that it would not attract unwanted creatures.  Goblin whelps, I was told, are attracted to the bodies of the dead.   I had never seen a goblin.   I had a feeling that would change in the near future.<br><br>The Testmaster waited until the body was buried to depart. &#8220;I take my leave of you broodlings.  Chasnic&#8230;&#8221; the oldest remaining Iksar in the clutch &#8230;&#8221;inform Shrikke of the rule of the Test, as well as the penalty for breaking the rule. &#8220;  The Testmaster looked at the sun through the trees, then back at us.  &#8220;It is getting late in the afternoon.  I would head back to camp and set defenses for the night, if I where you.  Of course, I am not you.&#8221;  With that he turned and wandered into the forest, moving quickly through the growing shadows.<br><br>Chasnic turned to the three of us as the Testmaster disappeared from sight.  &#8220;I am Chasnic, this is Zzrantan, and he,&#8221; pointing at a small broodling burrowing under a fallen log, &#8220;is Larriz.  There is one rule to the Test.  Don&#8217;t leave the valley or you will be killed.  You may leave the Clutch, you may make your own camp anywhere in the valley, you may do whatever you want, but it you try to leave the valley, death will find you. Any questions?  No? Good then.  We need to get out of here.  Zzrantan, you don&#8217;t think that the Testmaster was giving us a hint of something that could happen tonight?&#8221;<br><br>Zzrantan was a big broodling, nearly a full head taller than myself.  In the sheath at his side he wore the looted dagger that had opened up the gash along my ribs.  The wound was basically healed, but the memory had not faded.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;probably.&#8221;  Zzrantan looked around the forest with a bit of anxiety   &#8220;Goblin crap.  We need to get back to camp if the dead are walking tonight.&#8221;<br><br>Chasnic turned back to me.  &#8220;Get your stuff and give that mace to Zzrantan.  He will make better use of it than you if the dead come to visit tonight.&#8221;<br><br>I hesitated a moment before handing the mace to Zzrantan.  Zzrantan reached out his hand and spoke.  &#8220;I could take it after the dead have made you one of their own?&#8221; <br><br>Understanding the threat, but unwilling to give up my mace.  &#8220;In trade for your extra dagger and sheath.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;  Zzrantan untied the dagger and sheath from his waist and tossed them to the ground at my feet, &#8220;Although you will have to clean the dagger.  It has some blood on it, I think.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I think that you will not find my weapon to be any cleaner.&#8221;  I handed the mace to the larger broodling and picked the dagger and my pack off the ground.<br><br>Chasnic turned to the small broodling digging under the fallen log, &#8220;Larriz, have you found anything to eat?&#8221;<br><br>A dirt covered head popped up over the log.  &#8220;Yep, but only a few grubs and earthworms.  I hope that Shrikke&#8217;s parents where good enough to pack him a meal he can share with the rest of us.&#8221;<br><br>I hadn&#8217;t looked in the pack.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; shrugging my shoulders.<br><br>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;  Chasnic said.   &#8220;Either you have some and will share with the rest of us or not.  We don&#8217;t have time to look for anymore.   Larriz grab what is there and let&#8217;s go.  I would rather be waiting for the dead, if they come, then be chased by them.&#8221;<br><br>The discussion was over.  As I ran through the woods behind Zzrantan I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder sort of night this would become.  These broodlings believed that the dead would walk the forest tonight.  I wondered about the dead Iksar in the blue robe.  Would he come back to claim his mace.  I almost laughed when I decide that it was not my worry anymore, the mace was in someone else&#8217;s hands.<br><br>We stopped by a small clearing next to a stream.  A small hut of logs and branches sat against a large boulder with a small fire pit in front.  &#8220;That is our home.  And for the next two years it is your home, Shrikke.  That is if the dead don&#8217;t kill us all tonight.&#8221;  I was hoping for some type of sarcasm to follow the statement, some indication that things where not as bad as I thought they were going to be.  Unfortunately, it did not come.  &#8220;Listen to me and Zzrantan.  Do what we ask, quickly.  And watch everyone&#8217;s back.  Now the first order of business if for us to gather some wood for the fire and find some fist sized rocks.  But first, Shrikke&#8230;see what you have in the pack.  I don&#8217;t feel like eating earthworms tonight.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think the Honorable Naldiin did an excellent job condensing Iksar history.  There are a few holes that need to be filled in current events that I have questions about and can only speculate.<br><br>1.) How did the Iksar's become followers of Cazic Thule when it was certainly Innoruk(sp?) that gave them freedom with the coming of the Greenmist.  I'm assuming the makers of the Iksar where followers of the Lord of Fear and therefore the Iksar disposition is more apt to follow his leading.<br><br>2.) The troopers of Cabilis talk of the Emperor, but none have seen him or of this councel of five that is spoken of in the ancient texts.  The Necromancers seem to be the real power in Cabilis at the moment.  How did that happen?<br><br>3.) The test of betrayal within the SK guild for the Crusader's Khruki follows the events of an SK traitor who wishes to give ancient and holy texts to an agent of Mistmore.  The plan is stopped, but such dealings with Mistmore is a concern in the future considering the Necro's would be most likely to align with the ancient Vampire.<br><br>4.)  I am wondering if Innoruke(sp?...again)in the coming war will again claim the Iksar as his own and whether the Necro's will back him in his conquest of our race.  I do not think the SK guild would support this - Even though we use Necro spells, we are more aligned with the Shamans of our culture.<br><br>Okay...these are just wonderings on my part.  I do not know what the coming war will mean to my people, the Iksar, but I know it will be interesting to find out.<br><br>I'm sorry that I was not able to respond earlier, friend Tochail.

We of the necromancers freed our kind once, and we would not see them as slaves ever again.<br><br>Usula of the Wurmbane Clutch<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To the elf Judd<br><br>Softskin, you need not wish us Luck.  We of the Iksar make our own luck... but your observations are correct;  it is better for us to ally ourselves with Mistmoor over the Dragons, but not for the reasons you would assume.<br><br>As an elf, whose primary use in Cabilis is to make Smoked Wood Elf, I think you underestimate the might of our newfound empire.  Regardless of what Pusbag may think (trolls being a bit dillusional and all), we of the BroodofKotiz are masters of death, plague, and disease.  We are further masters of the undead, and have fashioned spells to aid us in their control.  Our monks are the best in all of Norrath simply because Cazic felt it necessary to give us the ability to regenerate our health quickly.  Our warriors, while not able to wear those plates of metal favored by other races, are quite dextrous and strong, and their cunning more than makes up for their discomfort with the plate armor.  And, even though I dislike the shadowknights and shaman of our race, they have powers and are powerful in their own right.  My point, softskin, is that while I believe we would side with Mistmoor in any upcoming conflicts with the dragons, it is not out of fear that we do so.  We are strong enough to withstand Mistmoor, and strong enough to withstand another assault by the cursed dragonkind...  but we think it prudent to ally ourselves with one who has directed efforts against dragonkind in our past... perhaps the old addage of the enemy of my enemy is my friend would apply here.<br><br>Usula, Iksar Necromancer<br>Queen of Fear<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The next post about our growing Iksar.  Hope you enjoy.  Thanks again for the praise and please feel free to make suggestions.  Good hunting to all who travel Norrath.<br><br>Part 8.<br><br>No one had to tell me that something was going to happen on the day that I reached my sixth season.  As each of the group I played with reached their sixth season, they simply disappeared.  I was concerned, but not fearful.  What is the worst that could happen?  My suspicions where confirmed when Squire Mharkas unexpectedly walked into my room the night before my sixth hatching day and placed a bundle on my bed.<br><br>&#8220;You will need this tomorrow, hatchling.&#8221;<br><br>"Thank you, Squire.&#8221;  Looking into the eyes of my teacher, &#8220;May I ask why?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Tomorrow you start another stage of development.&#8220;<br><br>"I thank you for the lessons I have learned, Squire.&#8221;  I reached under my bed to a box that contained the lightstone.  I opened the box, thinking that I would return the lightstone to Squire Mharkas.  The lightstone was not in the box.  I looked up at the Squire in confusion.<br><br>Squire Mharkas shrugged her shoulders.  &#8220;I have placed the lightstone in your pack.  I would suggest you keep it hidden or it will be taken from you.  There will come a time when it will be useful to you, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Again, thank you, Squire.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It is nothing, hatchling.  In fact, it might well become a curse rather than a blessing.&#8221;  Squire Mharkas stepped closer to me.   &#8220; I will remind you now, as I have said before, do not let anyone know that you have practiced magic up to this point.  The ones that will take over your training do not understand magic or it&#8217;s use and will punish you for even a hint of its power. &#8220;   Squire Mharkas turned to leave my room and stopped at the door.  Without turning around she gave me a final piece of wisdom.  &#8220;Remember hatchling, power is drawn to purpose.  Find your purpose and power will come to you.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I will remember, Squire.&#8221;  I looked at the pack on my bed then back at the Squire.  &#8220;Squire, I have one more question, if you please.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, hatchling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;What is your purpose and am I part of the power that has been drawn to you?&#8221;<br><br>The Squire almost smiled.  &#8220;When you figure out the first part of that question, you will know the answer to the second, hatchling.  Sleep now.  You will need it.&#8221;<br><br>Part 9.<br><br>Squire Mharkas sat in front of the fire holding a cup of warm mead with a blanket over her legs and tail, thinking about what the future could bring.  The Test of Sufficiency was a foolish tradition in the option of the Squire. A full third of the hatchlings would not survive the test.  &#8220;What a waste of potential,&#8221; she thought.  But traditions must be followed.  Every hatchling must past the Test in order to be admitted to one of the major guilds.  A parent, or caretaker in this case, could choose to have a hatchling skip the test, but the hatchling would then be delegated to a life of menial labor and have no real chance of success.  Even Kloks had to participate in the Test.  The Test was the only way to start climbing the rungs of power that lead to glory.  &#8220;He will succeed&#8230;He must.&#8221;<br><br>In the glow of the fire, feeling the warmth of the bright flames, Squire Mharkas heard the steps of an individual coming towards her front door.  The individual stopped and without knocking opened the door to the squire&#8217;s home.  Wordlessly, the intruder made his way through the house to the hatchling&#8217;s room, quietly opened the hatchling&#8217;s door and moved inside.  There was a cry of surprise from the hatchling, a hollow thud from a bunt object, and a sound of a small body hitting the floor.  This was the tradition, that each candidate would be &#8220;abducted&#8221; from his or her home by a member of the sponsoring guild.  To be taken out to the wilds of Kunark to be tested and the participant&#8217;s worthiness determined by skill, strength and luck.  Luck was always the unknown.<br><br>The Crusader walked into the where the Squire sat with a large bag thrown over his shoulder.  &#8220;This hatchling was not asleep.  Did you not give him the sleeping powder in his evening meal?&#8221;<br><br>Squire Mharkas staring into the fire did not look up at the Crusader.  &#8220;Of course I did, Crusader.  But I did not watch him eat his meal.  Maybe he was not hungry tonight?&#8220;<br><br>&#8220;Maybe you are foolish squire with little to occupy your thoughts except your own housework?&#8221;  the Crusader spat back.<br><br>Squire Mharkas did not move.  The Crusader was much more powerful than her.  A direct confrontation would be pointless.  However, confrontation can come in many forms and is usually is best when not direct.  Mharkas lifted her head from her warm mead to look directly into the eyes of Crusader Cotat.  &#8220;He is my charge until you leave this house, Crusader.  I hope you have not damaged him without my permission?&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Cotat shifted the weight of the bag hanging over his shoulder.  &#8220;The hatchling is not permanently injured, I assure you, Squire.  It was your responsibility to see to it that the transfer was done without incident.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You are wrong, Crusader Cotat.  It was my job to place the powder in the hatchling food.  It is your responsibility to take the hatchling to the place of testing.  I believe that one of the requirements is that the hatchling must be at full health when he arrives at the testing location.  You have attacked a hatchling under my care without my permission, damaged him before the Test of Sufficiency and then hiss at me how I have not fulfilled my responsibilities?  For the attack alone, Crusader Gikzic could have you stationed in the swamp watching the frogloks for a number of seasons."  Looking back down into her mead, "I will file a complaint tomorrow.&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Cotat eyes glinted in the firelight, &#8220;I had to subdue the hatchling.  He attacked me.  I had to defend myself.  Crusader Gikzic will understand that.&#8221;<br><br>Squire Mharkas slowly shook her head with a look of disappointment on her face. &#8220;True, but I&#8217;m sure your fellow Crusaders would be interested to know how you felt threatened to the point of bearing by an unarmed hatchling. That would make for interesting conversation in the barracks, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Cotat knew he was beaten for the moment.  &#8220;My apologies, Squire.  I have misspoken myself tonight.  I will take the hatchling to the testing ground, with your permission.  I am sorry if I have offended you.&#8221;  The apology was spoken by one who knew he had no choice to bend, but would not forget.<br><br>&#8220;You may leave Crusader.  I will talk to the Testmaster in the morning to make sure that the hatchling does not accidentally receive any more damage between here and the field.  I would hate to think that you would so careless in the transport of the hatchling as you where in his abduction.  But what am I to think?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You may think what you wish, Squire.&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Cotat spun on his heals and left the home, quietly closing the door behind him.  Squire Mharkas went back to watching the fire and drinking her mead.  She would have part of a season until she received her next hatchling&#8230;what to do with the time.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Another longish post and again please don't be afraid of commenting on the story.  I'm always up for new ideas.<br><br>Part 6.<br><br>It was six cycles of the moon before I actually got the lightstone to shine.  As I meditated with Squire Mharkas night after night, I had begun to actually feel the forces around me.  Those forces came from everywhere: from Squire Mharkas, from the stone beneath, from the air, even from my own body.  I could, while concentrating, feel the weak forces emanating from the burnout lightstone in my hand.  All I needed to do was connect the force around me to those coming from the stone.  This night I actually managed to grab a line of power from the object closest to the lightstone, my own hand, and feed it into the lightstone.  There was bright flash that I saw through my eyelids, then blackness.<br><br>I woke up sometime later; feeling as if I had been ran over by a rhino.  Unable to move any of my limbs, I tried to open my eyes and was greeted by the sight of Squire Mharkas standing over me with a disapproving look on her face.<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I should praise you or punish you.&#8221; Shaking her head.  She turned around and left the room leaving me to fade back into sleep.<br><br>I slept for what seemed like a long while.  After a time, I was able to stand up and walk out of my room.  The kitchen was vacant of movement.  It was early morning, before the slaves started breakfast.  I walked through our home without any real intent except to stretch my limbs.  I still felt weak, but I knew I would live.<br><br>I jumped as a voice called to me, &#8220;Hatchling, come here.&#8221;  I walked into Squire Mharkas&#8217; room.<br><br>The Squire was lounging on her sleep mat when I entered, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I awoke you, Squire.  I will try to be quieter.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You did not wake me up.  I have been awake for quiet a while.&#8221;  Looking me up and down. &#8220;How do you feel, Hatchling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Weak, Squire, and tired, but I feel stronger as well.  Does that make any sense?&#8221;<br><br>Squire Mharkas almost smiled.  &#8220;Yes.  It makes sense.  You touched power.  That is apt to make you feel stronger.   However, you made a mistake.  Do you know what mistake?&#8221;<br><br>I knew that I had done something wrong.  Squire Mharkas used magic and the forces around her everyday without ending up in bed.  I thought about how I had connected the lines of force.  There was no mistake in connecting the forces together or the lightstone would not have glowed.  Maybe I needed to control that connection better.  That was it.  I had connected the lines of force, but had not controlled that connection, draining me of my force.  I explained my thoughts to the Squire, sure that I had come to the correct conclusion.  I was rewarded with a tail slap to the side of the head that made the room spin.  As I tried to recover, another blow hit me, knocking me against a wall.  I was still weak enough that I could not focus on the series of attacks that crashed against my body.  I was dipping in unconsciousness when the beating stopped.  Squire Mharkas picked me up by my tail yelled for a slave.  She handed me off to the slave with some instructions I could not understand in my state of disrepair.<br> <br>Soon I was being carried through the streets of Cabalis thrown over the shoulders of froglok.  We stopped and I was unceremoniously dropped on the ground.  The world rocked for a while as I tried to get my eyes to focus.  I did eventually get control of the swaying in my head, and managed to prop myself up on one elbow.  I looked up to see an army of frogloks scrambling up and down busily working on the latest construction project.  I turned my head the other direction to see the calves of a Taskmaster, standing next to me.  I stood up.  The Taskmaster did not even look at me.  I then turned and bowed.  &#8220;Honored Taskmaster. I believe I am at your service.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, you are.  I have been instructed to teach you a very important lesson, hatchling, about the use of power.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;What lesson is that, if I may ask, Taskmaster?&#8221;<br>His whip snapped before I even saw the moment.  My eyes watered at the strap caught me across the small of the back.  <br><br>&#8220;No. You may not. From this moment you are a slave and until someone tells me different you will continue to be a slave.&#8221;  The whip cracked again, this time across the back of my leg.  &#8220;Get to work slave.&#8221;  I paused to ask a question, but stopped as I looked into the face of the Taskmaster.  &#8220;Slave, I would hate to have to have to kill you for not moving fast enough.&#8221;  My question stuck in my throat.  &#8220;Good. Help that group carry those stones to the builders.  I would suggest moving quickly.&#8221;<br><br>I lived as a slave for the next cycle of the moon. And except for sleeping in a pen by myself, I was treated no different that any of the other slaves. The Taskmaster&#8217;s whip was always ready to help speed up my lagging movements.  Twice I was given beating so serious that I thought I was going to die as a slave.   I remember, over the course of the next month, I learned some of the language of the froglok and thankfully, how to eat without actually tasting the food.  However, I did not have any great insights about the lesson I was being taught.  Until one day&#8230;<br><br>I was doing what I did most days, moving rocks, when a shout came from one the other side of the worksite.   One of the slaves, a very large human with blue tattoos over most of his body, suddenly charged a guard.  The human, catching the guard by surprise, wrapped the guard around the waist with his own arms, pinning the guard&#8217;s hands to his side.  The human, in an unbelievable feat of strength, lifted the guard off his feet and with a quick movement and a sound like a branch breaking, snapped the spine of the guard.  The human, throwing the guard down like a broken doll, looked around to see the other guard running towards him with a short sword drawn.  The human picked up the dead guard&#8217;s whip with one hand and a stone as large as a fist with the other.  As the guard got a few paces away from the human, the human threw the stone at the guard.  The guard was expecting the stone and raised his buckler to deflect the object.  However as the guard raised his buckler, he did not see the human take an impossibly long step towards him.  The guard was very surprised as he lowered the buckler to see the chest of the human directly in his path.  The guard tried to raise his weapon, but the butt of the whip had already come crashing down, caving in the guard&#8217;s skull.  The human looked around and saw no more guards.  In fact, all of us slaves looked around and saw no more guards.  I suddenly did not feel so good.  Yes, I was a slave, but I was Iksar and a young Iksar at that.  If any of these slaves decided to take out their frustration out on someone, the most likely target was I.  Luckily, the slaves where not interested in retribution, they were interested in freedom.  With a roar that made my scales rattle, the human grabbed the guard&#8217;s sword and buckler and lifted them in the air.  All the slaves suddenly had a choice, follow this large human and probably be killed or stay at the worksite and certainly be killed.  They chose to run.  In a croaking, screaming, roaring hoard, the slaves ran out of Cabilis toward the Swamp of No Hope.  I suppose they headed that direction because most of the slaves where frogloks captured within that swamp.  I was told later that all where killed as they tried to escape.  I believe that for the most part.<br> <br>Squire Mharkas found me later all alone at the site moving rocks.  &#8220;When I heard about the uprising, I decided to come down and see how you faired.  Are you well?&#8221;<br><br>I stopped from moving rocks and looked at Squire Mharkas.  &#8220;Yes.  I am fine.  And I have figured out the lesson, Squire.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You have, slave?  And what lesson would that be?&#8220;<br><br>I looked around the site, &#8220;After the human killed the guards today, I was suddenly aware that there where only two guards.  There were at least fifty slaves.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes.  Continue.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220; Slavery is an exercise in the use of power.  By using other&#8217;s power, you do not deplete your own.  By using the workforce of the other races around us, the Iksar can use it&#8217;s own power for other more productive pursuits.  I made the mistake of using the force from myself to power the lightstone instead of using the other forces around me, thereby making myself weak and vulnerable to the beating you gave me.&#8221;  I looked into the face of Squire Mharkas knowing I had come up with the correct answer.<br><br>She did not say anything.  She reached out and took my hand.  &#8220;Time you go home, hatchling.  You need a bath.&#8221;<br><br>I slept well that night.  The first time I slept well in what seemed a very long time.   However, that lesson changed the way I looked at my life.  Squire Mharkas would not find me as open to suggestion as before.  She would also find that I would never again be placed in a position of weakness easily.<br><br>Part 7.<br><br>&#8220;Squire Mharkas, are you my mother?&#8221;<br><br>Squire Mharkas purposefully put down the scroll she was reading and turned to me standing in the door of her study.  &#8220;Why do you ask, hatchling?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;One of the other hatchlings was taking about how he had hatched with his siblings in the home of his parents.  I remember hatching to your face.  You have never said you where my mother, but I thought it might be the case.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No.  I am not your mother.&#8220;<br><br>&#8220;May I ask who is my mother and father, Squire?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No.  I will tell you someday, but today is not that day, hatchling.  Now leave me, I have studies to perform.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes, Squire.  Thank you.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am humbled by your response to Shrikke's Bio.  I just hope these aren't getting too long for everyone to enjoy.  Please feel free to make suggestions and comments.  I have a pretty thick skin.  Good hunting.<br><br>Part 4. <br>  <br>Soon after the death of the halfling slave, my daily routine changed.  Up to that point, I would usually have a day with balanced amounts of eating, sleeping and playing organized by Squire Mharkas or one of slaves.  Added to my routine just before bed, was a time of meditation with Squire Mharkas.  I, like most two year olds had very little experience with sitting in one place for extended periods of time and would often not be meditative for very long.  I would try my best to stay quiet and concentrate on whatever topic the Squire had given to me, usually without much success.  It was odd to me at the time, as stringent as Squire Mharkas was about most of my activities; she was patient in this one.  No matter how often I would ask a question or squirm about on my pillow, she would quietly remind me of the task at hand.<br> <br>It was a number of cycles of the moon before I had any idea of the purpose of this nighttime ritual.  This night, Squire Mharkas told me a tale of a Lord Shadowknight named Dzanthul.  This Lord was given the task of killing a giant that had been plundering the countryside and killing many Iksars.  He had no trouble finding the giant.  The brunt had left a trail of death and carnage that a blind froglok could follow.  When he finally had caught up with the giant, he found a score of Iksars skinned and hung in the trees ready to be eaten.  Enraged by the sight, Dzanthul rushed into clearing to kill the giant.  The Shadowknight did not know that the giant had a helm that made him invisible and did not see the swinging axe the giant wielded.  The blow from behind caught Dzanthul in the ribs underneath the arm, throwing the Knight into a heap on the edge of the clearing.  The blow would have killed the Lord Shadowknight if not for his magical Dreadscale armor.  The giant thinking the Shadow Knight dead, sat down to feast on the skinned Iksars.  Halfway through the meal, the giant heard a moan come from the fallen Knight.  The Knight was regaining consciousness.  The giant cursed himself for not making sure the Shadowknight was dead and picked up a very heavy stone to crush the Lord.  At that moment, Dzanthul regained consciousness and rolled on to his back.  Seeing the giant coming towards him, with the large rock over his head, the Shadowknight quickly cast a spell of Steal Strength upon the giant.  The giant, weakened, was unable to hold on the to rock.  The rock came then crashing down upon the giant&#8217;s head, killing him.  The Lord Shadowknight plundered the body of the giant, taking the helm for his own, and returned to his home as a hero.<br><br>I asked Squire Mharkas if the story was true.  She said that the story was true.  I then asked her how the Lord had cast the spell.  She said that he had practiced for many years to sense the forces around him and that through controlling those forces; he was able to absorb the strength of the giant.  I knew I could ask one more question before Squire Mharkas and I began our nightly exercise.  I asked when was I going to be able to start practicing like the Shadow Knight Lord.  She said that I already had started.  <br><br>Then I understood.<br><br>Part 5.<br><br>I was in my fourth year.  As was the custom, after the morning meal, I would be taken by one of slaves to a courtyard just outside of the Temple to play with other Iksar hatchlings.   Throwing sticks and balls, chasing each other around the courtyard, and swimming in the canals where common activities.  Occasionally, one of the adult Iksars would organize a game of hide and seek.  Little did we know how important that particular game would become to our continued existence.<br><br>I remember a day when the sun shone high in the sky and was hot even before midday.  We asked the supervising Trooper if we could go down to the canals to swim.  Even at four years, an Iksar is at home in the water.  The Trooper said no, without explanation.  This confused our little playgroup.  The sun was hot and the canal was not running swiftly.  Why would he not let us swim?  He was being cruel without cause.  We crowded around the Trooper, asking incessantly for him to allow us swim.  His face grew hard and with a sweep of his pike he pointed towards the canal and told us to swim all we wanted.  <br><br>We all started running to the canal, suddenly a thought occurred to me and I stopped.  I turned toward the trooper, &#8220;What is the reason you do not want us to swim?&#8221;<br><br>He looked at me blankly.  &#8220;Funny that you ask, but as your playmates will find out, this is the time of year when the fish in the canals are breeding.  They will attack anything that jumps into the water. &#8220;  <br><br>Without thanking the trooper, I turned and ran after my friends yelling, trying to warn them about the fish.   They did not hear me.  Most were fortunate and got out of the water before the fish did any real damage.  Two of those playmates, I never saw again.  And one was considered &#8220;lucky&#8221; because the fish did not kill him, but took only an arm.  That hatchling now works in the slave pens, passing out meals and removing the filth. I would like to hear, sometime, his comments about luck.<br><br>The Trooper brought me before Squire Mharkas and told the story. I stood listening to the story with my head hung low.  I was ready for my punishment.  I was not sure why, but I felt as if I had failed my friends and Squire Mharkas.  Failure always has an effect and I was ready to come to terms with that effect.  The Trooper finished the story, bowed to Squire Mharkas and left our rooms.  I looked up, expecting a harsh conclusion to this day, to see the Squire looking pleased.  She must have seen the look of confusion on my face, because she knelt down, so she could talk to me eye to eye.<br><br>&#8220;I would have been angry if you had jumped in the canal with the other hatchlings.  You would have had your life made uncomfortable for many cycles of the moon.  I would have been angrier if you had died today.  So angry, I would have raised your bones and used them as an example to my next student as to what happens to foolish hatchlings that do not think through an event through before acting.   You did think today before you acted.  You asked the correct questions at the correct time.  That is success.  The hatchlings that were lost today are lost because they failed that test.  They were your friends and I&#8217;m sure you feel sorrow, but we Iksar do not have the luxury of surrounding ourselves with fools.  Even if those fools are our friends or our students.  Foolishness only leads to death.&#8221;  She paused and took my hand in hers.  &#8220;You pleased me today and today I will give you a reward for your success. &#8220;  In my hand, I felt her place the cold form of a crystal.<br>	<br>&#8220;What is this,&#8221; I asked, turning my hand over to look at the clear crystal.<br><br>&#8220;This is a lightstone&#8230;a burntout lightstone.  It comes from a creature called a willowwisp.  A normal lightstone shows a clear light.  This one does not have that ability on it&#8217;s own anymore.  However, if a person can concentrate hard enough and bring the correct forces to bear on the stone, it can again shine brightly.  I bought it for you too practice with when we meditate each night.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Thank you, Squire Mharkas,&#8221; taking the stone and placing it in my pocket.<br>	<br>&#8220;One more thing hatchling, do not tell anyone about the crystal. And I do mean anyone, not a slave or another hatchling.  To do so could have effects that neither of us will be able to deal with.  Do you understand?&#8221;<br>	<br>&#8220;I understand, Squire. I will obey.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I don't know if anyone is reading this, but posting the story motivates me to write a little more.  I hope you enjoy.<br><br>Part 2.<br><br>Good and Evil&#8230;Light and Dark&#8230;Moral and Immoral.  The whole of Norrath wraps themselves in the cloak of one or the other, trying to define themselves and the world around them.  The Iksar is not interested in such concepts.  Ask an Iksar if an act is good or evil, they will not be able to answer.  One beings act of savagery, is another&#8217;s act of conscience.  However, ask an Iksar if an act will promote or lose a cause.  That question, he can answer.   An Iksar is not defined by morality or lack thereof or even by a chosen cause.  It the skill and efficiency in achieving the goals of that cause that an Iksar is judged by this people and himself.<br> <br>The first two years of my life where spent as most children&#8217;s.  Learning the language of my race, testing my physical abilities and being taught lessons in obedience.  Squire Mharkas was my earliest teacher.  Her duties required her to make sure that I had enough to eat and place to sleep and most importantly, that I understood the principle of cause and effect.  At the earliest age and Iksar realizes that actions have consequences and that those consequences are often long lasting.   Sometime after my second year Squire Mharkas made it clear to me that I was to use the small pot in the corner of the room to relieve myself.  Making a mess anywhere else within room would be unacceptable.  Soon thereafter, I did have an accident while sleeping.  In the morning, Squire Mharkas saw the mess I had made.  She did not say a word to me.  She quietly told our halfling slave to remove the bedding and went about her daily duties.  As the evening approached and I was instructed to rest, I went to my room to find that no clean bedding had been brought back.  I did not ask Squire Mharkas about the lack of bedding, it would have been a waste of time on my part.  This was the consequence to my action.  Was it fair?  No, I was a young hatchling without complete control over my body.  I could not change that fact.  And I had tried my best to follow her directions.  Was I angry?  Yes.  However, consequences are rarely concerned with your ability or intension or even how angry you get.  What I did understand was that it was winter, the stones where cold and it was going to be a very long night.<br><br>As I tried to sleep with my knees against my chest, shivering uncontrollably against the wall of my room, I began to cry.  Are you surprised?  We Iksar can feel and express sadness.  We do not cry as some races do with the shedding of tears, but our expressions are just as heartfelt.  As I whimpered, I looked up to see the halfling slave come into the room.  Hoping that she had not been sent in by Squire Mharkas to quiet me&#8230;disturbing the Squire during here mediation and sleep period was not to be recommended&#8230;I quickly went silent.  The slave walked up to me and gently placed a blanket around my shoulders, patted me on the head and said something in her native tongue I did not understand and walked out of my room.  In retrospect, I know that the blanket was her own.  Actually, that the blanket was the only one she would ever receive as a slave.  I was grateful to her.  The blanket was not as good as my own, but it was warm and I quickly went to sleep.<br><br>The next morning I found the halfling slave&#8217;s body in the corner of the kitchen, with her throat cut.  As I stood looking over the body unable to put in perspective the scene before me, I heard the voice of Squire Mharkas.  &#8220;You may keep the blanket, unless you soil it.  I hope the death of the slave hurts you in a small way, I will not have lessons that I need to teach you be circumvented by anyone.  You have great potential, and it is my duty to see that you meet that potential.&#8221;   Squire Mharkas walked up beside me.  &#8220;Her death is not as important as the lesson you will learn.  My goal is to give you the best chance of successes.&#8221;  Pausing for a moment, she continued, &#8220;If I fail to teach you and you fall from the path set before you because of that failure, both of us will truly envy the death of this slave.  Now, it is time to eat.&#8221;<br><br>Part 3.<br><br>Crusader Gikzic looked up from his study of an ancient tome to watch Squire Mharkas walk into the room.  She was an able student of magic, but not the strongest of fighters.  Her rise to squire had been based mostly due to her ability to teach hatchlings.   To make them not only learn, but understand the lessons they were given.  She had had good success with hatchlings of little or no real potential.  However, her most recent charge was a hatchling with potential that was better than average.  It would be interesting to see how well she did with this one.  Motioning for the Squire Mharkas to join him &#8220;How is your hatchling progressing, Squire?&#8221;<br>	<br>Pulling out a chair across from the Crusader, Squire Mharkas sat down. &#8220;I had to kill my home slave this morning, Crusader.  I will need another.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Take whichever you want, Squire, but how does this answer my question about the hatchling?  You are not trying to change the topic, are you?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No, Crusader.  I had to kill the slave because she interfered with the hatchling&#8217;s training.  I think the lesson turned out to me more poignant than I could have hoped.  The hatchling is learning lessons quickly. He has a reasonable intellect.  I would like to start him learning the basics of spellcraft, with your permission.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;He is a little young, Squire.  The guild of Necromancers would not accept a hatchling of his age into even the youngest of their study groups.&#8221;<br>	<br>&#8220;I relies that, Crusader.  However, the hatchling is ready.  I am willing to teach him myself.&#8221;<br>	<br>&#8220;That will not go down well with the Necro&#8217;s.  They do not permit the teaching of magic outside of the Guild.  Sons and daughters of scale wolves if you ask me.  Keeping magical power out of the hands of the other guilds.  You know, I once heard of an Iksar studying spells outside of the realm of the Necromancers.  Enchantment, I believe it was called.  I think his brain sits in one of the jars within the Necromancer Guild.  Still alive, if you believe the Elders.  Are you sure you would want put yourself at odds with them?<br>	<br>&#8220;I am willing take that chance, Crusader.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Why?  Why put yourself at risk for a hatchling?&#8221;<br>	<br>&#8220;Because of his potential.  His rise will be greater than mine, in time.  With due respect, maybe greater than yours, Crusader.  I will be pulled up with that rise if I am careful.  I wish to give him, and myself the best chance to make that rise.  The knowledge of magic will be useful to him during the Test of Sufficiency.  Give him an edge over chaos.&#8221;<br>	<br>A silence pasted between the two Knights of Scale. &#8220;I will not give you permission to teach the child, however, I do not forbid it.  You are on your own.  If the Necromancer&#8217;s Guild gets information on this topic, you are alone.  I will not interfere with whatever may happen to you or the hatchling.  Are we in agreement, Squire?<br>	<br>&#8220;Yes, Crusader.  We understand each other.  My thanks to you for your wisdom on this issue.  May I take my leave.  I have much to study today.&#8221;<br><br>Crusader Gikzic turned back to the tomb he had been studying.  &#8220;You may, Squire.&#8221;  Squire Mharkas stood up and headed toward the door she had entered.   Looking up from the book,  &#8220;And Squire.&#8221;  Squire Mharkas stopped with her back to the Crusader.  &#8220;Good luck, Daughter of Rile.&#8221;  <br>	<br>&#8220;Luck has very little to do with it.  I think you taught me that, Crusader.&#8221;  <br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings all and welcome to my Tales and Rants.  My main character is an Iksar Shadowknight by the name of Shrikke Hopestealer.  I was in a creative mood one day and wrote up this short introduction to his history.  I hope you all enjoy.<br><br>Part 1.<br><br>&#8220;What is my name,&#8221; you ask.  I could tell you, but you would not hear most of the sounds, let alone be able to pronounce my name properly.  In truth, I doubt my name matters to you.  My race and I are merely the fuel for stories that frightened travelers tell around campfires while the wind howls and the moon is dark.  We have been, until recently, delegated to the role of myth and phantoms of the imagination.  Our existence used to scare children of your kind into eating their meals or quieting before sleep.  Do not misunderstand, we welcome&#8230;nay, embrace the part that we play in the lives of you and your offspring but it is a foolish practice in my opinion.  One day in the future those grown children will have to face the object of their childhood nightmares and in that instant will feel the horror of those stories.  Then, they will die.<br><br>The Iksar is unique among all the creations in Norrath. We alone remember all the events of our life even from the time of our birth.  The memories from the day we are hatched to the moments leading to death are recalled clearly.  In truth, we Iksars even remember some time spent before we hatch, within the egg.   The egg is remembered as a place of quiet security.  Those early moments of life basking in ignorance of the world around are cherished throughout the life of an Iksar but that peace is never repeated.  Whether a blessing or a curse, we can all remember that comfort.  Unfortunately, the warmth of the egg is the last warmth that any Iksar experiences. <br> <br>We also remember the day when the egg can no longer support our continued growth.  It is not lack of space or food that drives a young Iksar out of the security of the egg, but the sudden lack of air.  The place that had, for our entire existence, provided food, comfort and protection, tries to kill us.  All young Iksars initially experience panic.  Some let the panic overcome them and do not survive.  Others move from panic to anger.  That anger leads to the destruction of the place of our conception and forces us into the outside world of contention.  <br><br>Thus, I started my life with the betrayal of the egg.  As I started to feel the air within my egg get heavy, I kicked and punched those walls that contained me.  The more I thrashed about, the more quickly the little remaining air was consumed.  I could feel my lungs burning with the exertion, my consciousness beginning to blur.  At that moment, I knew anger and at that moment I knew freedom.  I broke from my jail, pushing my snout through the newly formed hole and began breathing deeply.  After the first hole, the rest of the egg collapsed quickly.  But unlike others of my kind, I did not start life with my siblings or those who shared their spark with me.  I emerged on a cold black stone, seemingly alone.  <br>	<br>The eyesight of a hatchling is sensitive in the beginning.  My eyes tried to adjust to glow of the dim light.  Suddenly, out of the gloom, a figure moved close to me.  I tried to move away, but my limbs where not yet strong enough.  As the figure moved closer, I could see that it reached towards me.  Thinking again that I had been betrayed, that this enigma was trying to end the life I had so recently fought to claim, I lashed out, biting the figure and tasting for the first time, blood.  A noise came from the shadow as it jerked away.  Again, it came at me.  Reaching for me.  This time I was not quick enough.   The figure grabbed me behind the head and instead of the death I was certain was to come, lifted me up to I could look into her face.   I did not know what she said at the time, it was just sounds.  I know now, because I have said them myself to hatchlings as they emerged into the world.  She said, &#8220;Welcome to your path, brother, Son of Rile, Follower of the Greenmist.  We have been waiting for you.&#8220;<br><br>Epilog 1.<br><br>Squire Mharkas walked through the halls of the Temple with the hatchling wrapped in her arms.  Coming down the opposite direction, Crusader Gikzic passed but turned to look at the Squire.  &#8220;Your hand is damaged, what has happened?&#8221;  Squire Mharkas look at her bleeding hand.  The cut would heal quickly, but was still somewhat painful.  &#8220;This hatchling drew blood when I tried to pick him up, Crusader.&#8221;   Crusader Gikzic bent do look into the eyes of the newest member of the order of Shadowed Knights and received a hiss for his troubles.  &#8220;An excellent beginning, Squire.  An excellent beginning.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>
