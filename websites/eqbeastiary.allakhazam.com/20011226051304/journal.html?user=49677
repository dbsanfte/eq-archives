Now ain't that sweet!  *Evil grin*  Well, I'm glad you're pleased and/or amused with what you read.<br><br><i>(Now you have to hunt down all my posts and rate <b>them</b> as 5's!  (Doh!  I s'pose I'm not supossed to make these suggestions, am I?  *Grin*  I'll just continue the slow grind toward guru status, then.  (The scary thing here is that I now have enough posts and sufficient karma that i'm more-or-less immune to rating.  (No, I'm not asking anyone to test this!)  But, I'd have to post rather a lot of dross, before my karma sank any significant amount.  And likewise, it will take me rather a lot of posts that people feel shine, before I get my 'guru' tag at 4.15.)))</i><br><br>I don't have an awful lot of time at the moment.  Sheesh.  I don't even have enough time for everything I should be doin', let alone for EQ!  So, sadly, you'll just have to be patient with me.  I should have some spare time in January, so I'll be making a very serious effort of wearing out my keyboard then.  And after that, it's the summer.<br><br>As for yourself and others having similar experience with petitions, I suspect most people have.  Sony is a business, and in the abscence of any real competition, they don't <b>have</b> to make much of an effort with this.  So they don't.  As frustrating as I find this, I understand it.  (And I can't honestly say I would do it any different.)  (<i>There is a Dilbert cartoon, where he [Dilbert] loses the connection in his mind betwen his work and his pay.  He ends up wandering around flicking his fingers, because he gets paid the same for this as for working. This <b>is</b> the way the real world works!  *Grin*</i>)<br><br>Anyhow, thanks for your post and the sentiment of appreciation.  (It really does make a difference!  (Now, everyone send both Allakhazam and Ilia a mail each telling them they've done a great job!  (Well, maybe in a month or so, when the SoL havoc has slowed down.  I think they'd be a bit perturbed by several hundred thank-yous at the moment.  *Laugh*)))<br><br>See ya in Norrath.<br><br>AlAaraaf.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"Te aurdire no possum.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey.<br><br>It's been a wee while, since I posted anything new.  <i>(Obviously this will be cause for great distress to everyone!  *Smirk.))</i>  Mostly, this is 'cos it's the end of term and I have several shedloads of work to do!  Ugh!<br><br>But...<br><br>It's Friday morning and SoL is now available in the UK.  I've been to my database lecture, scurried along to Game and now have in my possession a copy of the new expansion.  (I don't have a video card with T&amp;L, so I probably ain't gonna get far, mind you.)  <br><br><LI><b>First impressions:</b><br><LI>My god I hate the cover art.<br>Now, this ain't the first time I've seen it, if we're honest.  It's on Sony's EQ site.  And it's on the new patcher.  But, is there a good reason Firiona Vie should look so, awful?  The rest of it is fine and hunky-dory.  Just airbrush her off, or something.<br><LI>It's big too!  When it says 450Mb on the case, that's without any of the textures.  (In fact, I have just finished exporting my Everquest file from drive C: to drive E:, 'cos there's just no way I can free up another gig of space. <br><i>There's a sly advantage to this.  I still have my complete pre-Luclin installation on C:  So, if this all goes wrong, I can still play!  *Grin*</i>   <br><LI><b>The installer has an advert for 'Falcon Northwest PCs'?!?!?!?  Have only just discovered that one!  I've just paid for an expansion and it's carrying advertising?  *Spit*  Someone should be kicked in the balls for that!  I'm not at all impressed.  (Added to which, it's a US company.  Since they must be expecting to sell a coupla thousand copies in the UK, surely that's just vacant stupidity?)  Ok, we'll leave this one alone.  </b><br><i>(Onto disk two.  Adverts for Sony's online games.  This is acceptable to me.)</i><br><LI>Do horses make any sense to you?  (I haven't seen 'em and I surely can't afford one, but...  As far as I understand it, a horse makes you run fast.  Nothing more than this.  (Except for high level Paladins and Shadow knights, whose horses apparently fight.)<br>So, why does Verant think I will pay 10KPP for a horse, when I can buy TBoots, or the multi-quest for JBoots for 5KPP?  Seems that either pair of boots are more useful.  And cheaper...  What's the deal?  (Someone let me in on the secret, huh???<br><i>(Ooooh, it's loading new textures for the Tomb of the Sleeper.  It's gonna be a while before I get to see any of them!  *Grin*)</i><br><br>Oh for cryin' out loud.  I'm finished installing and the servers are down <b>YET</b> again!  As I have said before, I'm studying software engineering and I have a lot of sympathy, regarding the difficulty in writing bug free code.  (And I'm not writing anything with even a shade of the complexity of Everquest!)  However, I am beginning to wonder what the hell they've been doin' during the Beta testing.  Since I have a lecture to go to in an hour, I guess I won't be getting to look at the new and improved EQ, will I now.<br><i>(Just as a side thought, do you suppose that if every EQ player was refunded the cost of the downtime, out of John Smedly's pay packet, do you think this would get fixed a bit faster?  Yes, I know we're talking about very little money per person, but across 400K people, that's a whole lot of money.)<br>....<b>*Chink*</b>...<br>....The penny drops....<br>This <b>is</b> the Beta test, isn't it?  *Sigh*<br></i><br>Back to the subject in hand...<br><br><LI>Aren't the system requirements a bit steep?  Frankly, I'm ok.  I recently upgraded a lot of bits of my PC.  The only thing that's not up to scratch is the video card.  And that's getting done over Christmas.  <br>Still...  An awful lot of people seem to have gotten the shaft here.  (Which just doesn't seem to make much business sense to me.)<br>Seems to be an awful lot of people who're semi-shafted by the complexity of upgrading too.  I spent a while trying to explain to an in-game  friend how to disable the onboard video on the motherboard, so they could install a new card.  (She'd called Dell, who suggested they boot into safe mode and just uninstall the drivers.  Should they not know that's not gonna be enough???)  <br><br>Eeeek.  I gotta go!  Lecture in thirty-five minutes.  (And no EQ for me!)  I'll continue this later.<br><br>AlAaraaf.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>"Te aurdire no possum. Musa sapienum fixa est in aura."</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey.<br><br>Slow day today.  After about a dozen edits, I finally managed to get the UBB code for a link right.  On the vague offchance anyone wants the commands, I found this link, that details the commands:<br><br>Commands are <a href=HTTP://www.chinaglass.co.uk/ubb/ubbcode.html target=_new><b>here</b>.</a><br><br>There <b>is</b> an equivalent page within this site.  I know there is, because I have seen it!  But, I can't find it.  If anyone knows the URL and wants to email it to me, I'll change the above link, to the more friendly Allakhazam address.<br><br>Hope this is of use to y'all.<br><br>AlAaraaf.<br>"Death is coming..."<br><br>=================================================<br>One thing:<br>When you create a link using the tag, you need to strip the http:.// <i>(Again, no '.'!)</i>  Otherwise it refuses to work.  (This is the bit where I keep naffing it up!)<br>&gt;Edit: 18/11/01<br><br>=================================================<br>Crud!<br>I just noticed the page I linked to doesn't include bullets.  I know these can be used here, but I can't remember how they work.  I should probably just compile a list of UBB commands as a post.  *Sigh*<br><br>...A little later...<br><br>Bullets are done with the [ li ] tag.  <i>(No spaces!)</i>  As always, this is pretty much the same as HTML.  But, you don't ned to use '[ul]' or '[/ul]'.  I think I'll have to give serious thought to doing my own UBB code list.  *Grin*<br>&gt;Edit: 19/11/01<br>&nbsp;<br>"Te aurdire no possum.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi.<br><br>I died a few days ago...  <br><br>I'm sure you're all highly impressed by this statement.  In fact, I also died yesterday and once again today.  I die a lot.  Mostly it's ok.  But, there was something special about the death a few days ago.  I lost my level!  Yet, even that isn't was special about it.  (I lost my level again today!  (Not the same level!  I'm now just a bubble and a bit from L43.)  Still, no big deal.)  <br><br>I was killed by Joshel the large!  This, in case you arent already aware, is the diminutive fellow who stands waiting for the ferry in Iceclad ocean.  Essentially what happened, was that a pop-up advert kicked me out of Everquest.  Now, because Everquest uses DirectX to try to hang onto control of your computer, even when it doesn't have focus, it still soaks up any commands entered.  (This is very bad design, BTW.)  So, having crashed to the desktop, I noticed a webpage and thought I'd check for an update.  <i>F5</i>  Nothing happens.  No matter, I'm not really interested and I don't wanna miss the ferry.  I switch back to Everquest and I'm dead...<br><br>When I scroll up a little, I immediately realised I had cast a DoT at Joshel, who was suitably unimpressed and beat me to a pulp.  I honestly can't say I blame him.  Anyhow, I went and collected my carcass and asked my guild if anyone knew a cleric who had a few minutes to spare.  (A member of my guild switched to a cleric alt, so I didn't have to yell too long.)  While waiting, for the kind cleric, I spent some time catching snowflakes...<br><br>Have you ever noticed that Norrathian snowflakes aren't actually little round dollops?  I never had.  I'd kinda assumed they were basically the same as the rain.  <b>Nope!</b>  Snowflakes are little stars.  <br><br>This sorta thing really impresses me.  It's an attention to detail thing.  <br><br>Probably the most amazing thing about Norrath has to be the sunsets.  I live in a top floor flat, with a real good view of hills and mountains.  From time to time, I get to see some amazing sunsets.  But the sunsets in Everquest impress the hell out of me.  This is something that probably every player with any aesthetic sensibility has noticed.  <i>(It's pretty hard to miss.)</i>  <br><br>The world of Norrath is full of these things.  Part of what makes them special it that unlike the sunsets, they're not something everyone sees.  And it's nice that despite the certain knowledge that this would be the case, someone took the care to craft them.<br><br>One of my biggest complaints about Everquest is that there are zones I'll probably never be able to go sight-seeing in.  And I want to!  I wanna be able to wander through the temple of Veeshan and gawk at the dragons.  As it is, the best I can do is watch Talisman get wiped out in their <a href=HTTP://www.guildvision.org/movies/Wipeout.wmv target=_new><b>video</b>.</a>  And the dragons are pretty damned fuzzy in that!   <br><br><i>(I just can't get the link right.  Gonna have to pester Illia for the UBB code page.  *Grin*)</i><br><br>One other thing I will share with you.  I think the music for the crystalline passages in the Crystal caves is marvellous.  Go listen to it.  Most of the music in Everquest just bugs me.  In fact, I play with the sound off, because it's mostly awful.  <i>(I wonder if they'll revamp that in SoL.  Not much chance, I guess.)</i>  But this is different.  In fact, I've even been known to go sit in a cave and just sit and listen, as a break from the constant EXP grinding...<br><br>Anyhow.  Just some thoughts, I felt were worth sharing.  <br><br>What do you love about Everquest?<br><br>AlAaraaf.<br>"Death is coming..."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Te aurdire no possum. Musa sapienum fixa est in aura."</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi.<br><br>A curious thing happened last night...<br><br>I registered my journal as being active and wrote two posts.  After this, I went to bed.  When I woke up, since I had no lectures today, I thought I'd have a look at my journal and see if anyone had visited, to see what I had to say about the world.<br><br>Now, since I had just started, I had taken a small liberty.  In order to cozen a little extra traffic to my journal, I rated it with five stars.  *Blush*  (Illia, you should <b>NEVER</b> have given people the chance to rate their own posts!  *Cackle*)  So, upon logging on, I first checked my Karma.  No changes there.  <br><br>When I went into my journal, I noticed that the rating on my rather long and sprawling post regarding petitions had moved to 3.90.  (My default karma was 3.80, which suggests that one kind person gave me a 4.00.)  No additional comments, but since they obviously liked my post, I won't complain.  The curious thing was that the rating for the whole journal had dropped to three stars.  *Sigh*  <br><br>Now, this would suggest that some charming person decided to give me a rating of one.  (Reserved for flames and posts with no redeeming factors!  *Weep*  How cruel you can be!)  I shall just have to assume that this was done in the name of dragging my journal down to the 'normal' 3.00.<br><br>But, I shall ask of you once again...<br>If you don't like what I have said.  (Here, or in my other posts.)  Please say so and tell me why...<br><br>Anyhow, I have an exam tmorrow, so I'm gonna head for Norrath and study relational modelling and QBE, while meditating between kills.<br><br>Have a nice (death free) day.<br><br>AlAaraaf.<br>"I know I can win every fight.  That doesn't mean I'm not going to try!"<br><br><br><i>PS:  On the up-side, thanks to the kind rating of certain people, my karma has moved to 3.87.  The slow climb toward Guru status continues.  *Grin*</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Te aurdire no possum. Musa sapienum fixa est in aura."</td></tr>

I have a few ideas for things I'd like to see here in Allakhazams.  (Not a whole lot.  I'm a pretty happy bunny where that is concerned.  *Grin*)<br><br>I'm just gonna edit the list as new things come to mind, or when I think an old idea was askew.  Obviously, since the likelyhood of Sony/Verant reading this and deciding to put something in, is a little lower than the probablility I'll grow wings, there's no real need to be serious.  But, ignoring the seriousness thing would make this even more futile than it already is:<br><br><b><u>Everquest</u></b><br><br>Combine whole (or partial) stacks of stuff when making things: <br><i>Is there anything worse than the whole dismantling stacks of items to combine things for trade skills?  There are few changes I'd like more than the opton to grab a whole stack of each component and make them into stacks of new stuff.  All in a single combine.  I'd happilly accept a <b>much</b> higher chance of failure and no chance to gain skill for this.</i><br><br>Lose the current frontpage at the official site.<br><i>I hate the current front page on Sony's official site.<br>I don't like the image.  It has no content.  It takes ages to load.  And in all honesty, how many people are impressed by the animation on Firiona's staff and the lighthouse?  (How many people even notice the lighthouse???)<br>Please, just lose that stupid ugly page and go back to the old one.  Which of course is where you have to go anyway.  Do you see the flaw?  It adds nothing and it's just sucking up people's bandwidth.  Great.  Just great!</i><br><br>On the subject of the official site, I'd also like to see:<br><i>A JavaScript pop-up that tells you pertinent important messages.  (All servers offline for scheduled patching. ~ All servers of for unscheduled patching. ~ XXXX server off for maintenence.)  Wouldn't this be nice?  To have a little useful information somewhere you don't have to hunt for it?<br>This is one of the basics of interface design.  Sony/Verant have people working for them who can design and create a world like Norrath and they can't manage to build a well designed website.  Seems just a little strange.<br>I'm pretty sure I could do this in about five minutes.  (And I'm not that hot with HTML and JavaScript.  Illia could probably do it in under a minute!)</i><br><br>Useful quests:<br><i>I really like doing quests.  I like following a storyline and acheiving something of this kind.  This is not to say I'm particularly good at questing.  I invariably get myself killed and often more than once.  That's ok.<br>My gripe is that questing is really just for items.  The dificulty here is that by the time you can do the quest and obtain the item, you probably have something else that's more useful.  (This has been the case for me on a few occaisions, and I am completely untwinked and don't group often!)<br>What would be nice, would be that I could do a quest and the reward would be a big ol' chunk of EXP.  A chunk of EXP that's comparable to the EXP I could've earned killing stuff, instead of questing.  <br>This is, of course, not an entirely original wish.  I've seen similar things suggested by a number of people.  But, it would definitely make questing far more fun.</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Allakhazam</u></b><br><br>User Karma guide:<br><i>I know this exists.  I've seen it!  But I'll be damned if I can ever find it when I want it.  Personally, I'd just love it if you'd stick a link to this on the menu on the left of the screen.</i><br><br>Ubb commands list:<br><i>Really this is the same as my comment about the user karma guide.  I have only just started playing with UBB code.  I'm reasonably ok with HTML , so it's not too painful, but a guide somewhere handy would be great.<br>(My biggest problem is actually that I keep trying to use tags with the &lt;&gt; brackets used in HTML.  I'll get used to that, eventually.  *Grin*)</i><br><br>(Please don't get the wrong idea.  I love this site.  And these're pretty minor issues.  They're just close to the top of my head just now.)<br><br>Expect more unfulfilled desires...<br><br>AlAaraaf.<br>"Death is coming..."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Te aurdire no possum.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Good morning children.<br><br>Patch day has just finished.  (Well, I am assuming it has finished.  The last I heard was that it was extended to 23:30 GMT.)  Patch day <b>always</b> catches me unawares.  Not for any particularly good reason.  I just don't check for it and so the first I know is that I try to log in and Norrath just ain't there.<br><br>This of course leads to vast amounts of extra traffic to sites such as Allakhazam and to Sony's Everquest forums.  And, every time I bother to read the forums, lots of people are very unhappy with the service they receive.  The bulk of this particular post, started off as a reply in one of these forums.  Essentially, one person wrote a post in response to all the complaints, the essence of which was this, <i>"I have petitioned on around twenty-five occaisions and on each occaision my petition has been handled quickly and acceptably."</i>  The poster was Bubulu.  (If you don't agree with my assessement of your post, let me know, I'll happilly admit my error, if I got something wrong.)<br><br>As they are wont to do, Sony/Verant fairly swiftly locked the thread.  It was moving a little away from the technical support side, I will admit.  Still, the somewhat draconian way they manage their boards doesn't seem designed to promote user-friendliness.  What the hell, it's their board.  I don't go there often anyhow.<br><br>I wrote a reply detailing my experience of petitioning and in-game customer service.  This was written far quicker than is my preference, but this was with the expectation the thread would die pretty quickly.  The following is the slightly expanded version of my original reply:<br><br><i><br><b>Petition 1:</b><br>When I was about level eighteen, I hunted in Kurn's tower.  On one occaision, I was fortunate to be in a fairly strong and effective group.  We were wandering around the lower levels, hunting the burynai and undead.  Our aim was to get to the skeletal jester's room and hunt him.  When we were about half way there, the server died.<br>I don't know what this was.  It wasn't for patching, but all servers died.  It was off about thirty minutes.  No big deal in any important way.<br>Unfortunately, when I returned, I was alone in the middle of several burynai who had obviously been told to watch out for me and to avenge their lost kin.  This they extrememly quickly proceeded to do.<br>Feeling somewhat put out at this, I petitioned.  (Lets not forget that Kurn's tower has a maxture of living and dead monsters and this makes corpse retrieval pretty tough!)  I was online for about two hours after this and didn't receive a reply.  Ultimately, I did manage to get my body out, without further death.  (Which is not to say it didn't involve several near death experiences and a few nasty trains to zone.)<br>I'd be willing to accept that after a server crash, there was probably a whole stack of petitions, for similar complaints, so maybe it's understandable.  I wasn't really too put out and sometimes these things happen.<br><br><b>Petition 2:</b><br>My next petitioning event occurred just a few levels later.  I logged in (starting in the Field of Bone) and promptly plummeted through the ground to the base of the zone.  I took a couple of hundred points of damage, but happilly did not die.  It was close and if I'd been just a couple of levels lower, I'd have been a pancake.<br>The Field of Bone seems to have quite a few problems with spaces between walls and the like.  Many's the time I have hunted something which has run through the walls of the pit and escaped me, only to return when part healed and pummel me fromma location where it is safe.  (Isn't that a bannable offense?  Go ban these cheating creatures!)  None-the-less, I still love FoB.  It's by far the nicest newbie zone I have experienced.  (In my perhaps not entirely humble opinion...)<br>Well, being that being chucked through the world is probably not entirely normal, I petitioned for help.  After about fifteen minutes, I got bored and Gated out.  (Making it a pretty minor error for me.  An inconveinience, but no big deal.  If I had been a non-Gating class, on the other hand, this would have been a <b>HUGE</b> problem.  I pity the people who suffer this.)<br>I played for about two hours, before quitting for the day.  In this time, I did not receive a reply from my petition.  I'm willing to accept that they maybe looked at me and decided I'd fixed it for myself.  (Recent experience suggests to me this is not the case!  I'll explain more later.  (If soap operas can use cliffhangers, is there any reason I can't???))  Either way, I got no response.  I'd have been happy with, "Hi.  Sorry we didn't get to you in time to help.  Take care."  It's conceivable they were busy, but it's not such a good argument as in the first petition.  I'm inclined to be less forgiving this time.<br><br><b>Petition 3:</b><br>At level thirty, I could no longer contain my need to explore the world.  This is not simple for an Iksar.  After a few levels, I found it necessary to return to Cabilis to avail myself of the merchantry and banking facilities.  I had previously discovered that certain NPC's outside the port of Firiona Vie were both displeased by my presence and immune to my cloaking myself in the shadows.  I therefore decided that although I would return through the Firiona Vie zone, I would avoid the dock.<br>Interestingly, it is possible to swim off the edge of the zone.  (You just know this is gonna be bad, don't ya?  Actually, it's both better and worse than it seems.  Someone recognised this problem in this zone and has a fix for it! (I'm so impressed. (Seriously. Not sarcasm. Good design.))<br>You get a message explaining you have fallen through the world and will be moves to a <b>safe</b> place.  The only problem is that you're dumped at 0,0 in the zone.  Which if you're an Iksar necro, means you're surrounded by creatures that are both KoS and see through invis!  These creatures promptly dismember me and I discover myself back on the other side of the world.  (I lost my level to boot!  *Sob* <br>So, I register myself a petition.  (I was so demoralised, that I couldn't be bothered hauling myself across the world to get my corpse.)<br>A guide showed up within ten minutes. (Very impressed.) She asks what happened.  I explain my plight in great detail. The guide asks me to wait.  Within ten minutes the guide has agreed to ressurect and to move my carcass close to Lake of Ill Omen zone, where I can loot it safely.  (I'm very pleased.  Not really much more I could ask for here.  The response was quick, the guide was courteous and my problem was resolved.)<br><br><b>Petition 4:</b><br>I have just made level forty-one, killing terrors in the Crystal caves.  I have decided that the experience they give is getting rather small and decide that hunting the Ry'Gorr orcs might work well.  I am concentrating on the four Ry'Gorr centurions that spawn at the posts in the corners inside the fort.  I kill the two closest to the CC zone with brutal efficiency.  I now try for one of the centurions close to the entrance.<br>This is where everything went wrong.  I pulled the roaming orc.  Now, I knew immediately that I had screwed up and bolted for the CC zone.  And I made it.  Except that I restarted naked in Thurgadin.  And I had lost my level!  *Whimper*<br>Now, a little detail...<br>I hit the zone with a tiny slither of life.  (Literally two pixels of red on the bar!)  I received the message, 'Loading, please wait.'  Now, if I had died legitimately, I should have had the overhead view, a death message and a message when I respawned in Thurgadin to the effect that I had lost my level.<br>The other peculiarity was my experience loss.  I was 2 1/2 blue into level forty-one, before death and 1 1/2 blue from level, after death.  Now, if I died in level forty, I would have lost precisely one blue bubble.  So it seems remarkably odd that I should end up with less experience than if I had died with far less experience.<br>So, once again, I enter a petition...<br>And,again, a guide is with me within minutes.  (I'm so impressed.  All I ever hear is people complaining and again I have an almost instant response!)  I explain in considerable detail what happened.  I am asked to wait.  After a while, I am asked to '/report' the section of text, where I zoned/died.  I do this.<br>I am now told that the server GM says there is no bug.  I asked if I could speak to the server Gm and was told that he wasn't online.  (She was speaking to him through ICQ.  Well, it's workable, but I'm <b>REALLY</b> not impressed.  So, I was told to email the GM about this.  <br>This happened about one R week ago and I have never had a response.  <br>Now, as far as I am concerned there <b>IS</b> a bug here.  There isn't really any room for debate about this.  <br>Either:<br>*  I died before zoning.  In which case the display was incorrect.  (Bug)<br>*  I was killed by the orc while zoning.  Which should not be possible.  (Bug)<br>*  I was killed by something in the zoning process.  Which also should not be possible.  (Bug)<br>The only room for debate was whether I should, or should have not died.  The presence of a bug is a certainty.  But the GM doesn't want to speak to me.  *Shrug*  I guess he's off my Christmas card list.<br>(The only good thing, is that someone told me, "Get on with it.  If the GM contacts you, he'll contact you."  Korie, you are my conscience and my common sense.  (Hey, I don't have either of my own.)  But seriously, I was getting very wound up.  As a small side note, this seems very good advice for people dealing with guides and GM's.)<br><br><b>Petition 5:</b><br>After losing level forty-one, I was just too annoyed to bother EXP grinding again.  (This is particularly cruel, since I ignored all the Halloween GM events, to get out of level forty.  It was worth it, but it was harsh losing the level.)  So, I went questing.  Specifically, I went to Permafrost to complete the Word of Shadow quest in the temple of Solusek Ro.<br>After some trouble and one death, (caused by my own stupidity,) I have the final component and I run back to the temple, ready to claim my reward.  I go to Vurgo and hand him his not, and the two books he requested.  <b>NOTHING</b>?!?  No!  This has cost me three deaths in all and nothing?  Now, those of you who have done the quest might notice he also wanted some coins.  But, it had been a long time since I started and I forgot about this.  I felt very frustrated and, well, simply put, robbed.<br>So, I apply petition number five.<br>And then I check on Allakhazams and discover Vurgo wanted some coins.  (There is a design aspect here.  He only tells you what he wants when you give him a shadowed book.  Now it was about two months of RL time, before I had the other stuff for him.  If he'd reminded me what he needed, I wouldn't have had this problem.  No matter.)<br>I hand over the coins and get my book.  I'm not gonna equip it, I want it just for the effect.  I'm so happy.<br>I check and there is one trainee guide online.  I send him a tell, explaining what I did and asking him to delete my petition.  He tells me that that's fine, but that he will send me one more tell.  (For his report.)  He sends me a tell saying, 'I believe you need no help, if it is acceptable to you, I will close your petition.'  I say yes and appologise profusely and everyone is happy.<br></i><br><br>Now, you may recall that in connection with the second petiton, I said I don't think that someone looked at my situation and decided everything was ok and closed the petition.  This is based upon the guide in petition five's comment about sending a tell for his report.  This suggests that guides have to file reports on the petitions they handle.  (Which would only be common sense, really.)  But, that makes it look far more like ignorance, than thoughtful consideration, where my second petition was concerned.<br><br>So...<br>There you have it.  My experience of in-game customer service.  Certainly not so bad as many people have complained of having experienced.  At the same time, not so hot either.<br><br>I certainly have no problems with any of the guides I have spoken to.  They have always been perfectly courteous.  And, in the instance of petition four, I would be willing to accept that they probably have no choice but to accept a GM decision.<br><br>I have read in a number of places that guides aren't really given the tools and/or authority to do anything useful.  From my own experience, I'd be inclined to take a middle of the road stance.  (Or at least to wait for more empirical data.)  <br><br>I'm not at all impressed with the GMs role in this.  Whatever his response, I'm inclined to think that it's sheer ignorance to hide offline and fail to reply to an email for a week.  If he genuinely doesn't have the time to answer an email within a week, let alone to be present online, there is a major problem with the staffing levels.  (This occured at about 23:00 GMT.  So pretty much peak playing time!)<br><br>And there you have it...<br>All my thoughts on my current customer services experience.  And the first post in my journal.  Let me know what you think.  (Be nice.  I don't mind if you think I am talking abject rubbish and feel the need to say so, but say it in a useful way.  Tell me <b>why</b> you think I'm talking rubbish.  (It really irks me when people rate my posts badly and don't say why they had a problem with it!))<br><br>I'll share more of my thoughts with ya, when I have the time to construct them into useful posts.<br><br>AlAaraaf.<br>"Death is coming..."<br><br><br><br><br><i>PS:  Happilly, I have regained level forty-one and have a nice healthy slab of EXP to hold it in place!</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Te aurdire no possum.
