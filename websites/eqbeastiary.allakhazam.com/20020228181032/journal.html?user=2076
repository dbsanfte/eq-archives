	   <tr><td colspan=2>The sun slowly rose above Fortress Talishan, spilling light into its courtyard. Standing up on the watchways, Eiczk watched young warriors practicing below. &quot;This lot will be lucky if one of them makes Footman.&quot; He thought aloud. Looking up he studied the rays of light pouring over the Fortress. He had risen early, as many things needed to be done. Papers to look over, reports to read, and at some point he had to go see Usula. He had begun to understand why Eator hated paperwork so much: It was downright boring, and never seems to end. The nightly reports that had come in by the time he rose were normal, quiet most everywhere, occasional skirmishes with the few remaining goblins and giants. Nothing really that new. However one report disturbed the warrior. News of Wurms stirring in the Skyfire Mountains. <br><br>A scout had reportedly seen an Iksar leading something up into the mountains. He had been following the trail of corpses that were left behind. Most unrecognizable, and they looked... chewed according to the scout. He had not followed the Iksar far to avoid entanglements with any of the locals. Shortly after loosing sight, sounds of combat were heard accompanied by the roaring of the Wurms. The scout fled the mountains with a few on his tail, trying to turn him into lizard stew. This lone Iksar was disturbing, something about it just wasn't right. Eiczk knew there were no soldiers sent on any missions up that way. Vek, Glox, and Xog had reported no approved incursions into the skyfire mountains by the council. He was not so sure about Glosk or Usula doing so. In fact he doubted the two would do this. He would of course still have to ask, but nicely this time. There would be no real reason for them to stir up the dragons, there would also be no reason to stir up either of the two after gaining so much. It was best to attack the Dragons in force, that way they had no time to group up. This stirring could present a nasty problem for New Sebilis. <br><br>He leaned over the railing, watching 3 soldiers escort another iksar in, dressed in a dark greyish leather, the garb the outpatrol was wearing. Eiczk did not recognize him though. He had ordered several legions to patrol the water around Kunark, and any unrecognized vessels were to be boarded, and sunk if not friendly. The Swiftails, Scaled Mystics, and the Brood of Kotiz had also sent detachments to aid in spellcasting and fighting. The members had been given either grey robes, or a greyish leather to help hide them as they swam. Several small boats trying to sneak in had been sunk so far. They had also put a nasty dent in the Elven fleet that still patroled nearby. Eiczk was pleased when reports told him of the boats moving further and further off the coast. They had a navy now, but small groups of Iksar making tactical strikes on lone boats was still a very effctive deterrant. <br><br>He turned to meet the entourage that had worked its way up to where he stood. The Trooper leading the escort addressed him. &quot;Sir, this is Xarnth of the outpatrol. He comes with news. He will not give his report, rank or business to anyone sir. Except to say that he must speak with you.&quot; Eiczk looked surprized. &quot;Well now, that does not bode well. Orders were for any on the outpatrol that if reports were to be given, they were to be given to their guild's commanding officer. Amongst the warriors that is Trooper Fryp. There are also Shaman, Monks and Necromancers assigned to the outpatrol. So which guild are you from, and why do you come to me?&quot; Xarnth cut his eyes to the Trooper that escorted him in. &quot;Trooper, give us a moment, but stay at hand if I call.&quot; The Trooper saluted, bowed, and walked partway down the stairs. &quot;First of all, regardless of what guild you are in, when you come to Fortress Talishan you give your name, and business when asked. If you are a warrior, you give your Name, rank and orders to be within the Fort. The guards challenge anyone who comes near for security reasons. Do not stray from this in the future. Now what is so urgent you have to speak directly with me? I have lots to do, and if this is not of the utmost importance, I will insure your Commander gives you plenty of reason not to violate the chain of command.&quot; <br><br>Eiczk stared at the Iksar, frowning angrily. He hoped the answers forthcoming would give him reason to report Xarnth. He hoped this because somewhere he knew inside this information meant more bad news. Leaning against the railing overlooking the Courtyard of the fortress, he waited.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Feb 28 02:02:10 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Eiczk Draygoner<br>34th rank Warrior<br>Legionnaire of Cabilis<br>Xegony<br><i>-Death comes to all, but for the fallen it shall come with a vengance.</i></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The gnomish necromancer stood at the front of the small boat. Thoughts of what would happen soon drifted through his head as he stared at the calm water leading to the land of Kurnak. The three other gnomes on the boat he had found at the oasis, and after explaining about his uncle's fate at the hands of the Iksar, they were eager to help in his attacks. Of course, the promise that they would split 100% of the profits gained in the venture helped a bit too.<br><br>The gnome dusted off his black robe, glowing runes shimmering slighty in the darkness. He nodded to himself as he thought of his newly found friends. Jan and Thenen, two brothers who claimed to had visited the far place of Odus and apparently obtained thier armor there. They both wielded swords of some sort. The last gnome never spoke besides to chant the prayers of his spells. The necromancer didnt know the name of the gnome or even particularily trust the guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they would do better than any Halfling or Human, they were determined and loyal to something more than coin, they were loyal to their ideals. They knew that the wrongs the Iksar had commited must be fixed.  <br><br>All of these thoughts went through the gnome's head as he boat slipped silently through the water. Jan and Thenen slept on the deck of the ship, snoring softly next to their packs. The young necromancer walked into the ship and was about to go to bed as the whole ship shuttered violently. He ran up the stairs to see Iksar on board the ship! Jan and Thenen had jumped up and donned their armor with extreme speed and most of the buckles and fastens were not done correctly. They stood back to back as the Iksar snarled and struck at them with odd shaped weapons. Mana began flowing from his fingertips as the gnome began casting the spell which had brought death to the orc a few days ago. Jan leapt forward and swung wildly at an Iksar, cleaving a long wound in its chest. The Iksar fell backward off the ship as it clutched at its wound. Another Iksar slashed with a sheer blade that neatly shattered Thenen's shield as he attempted to block the blow. An Iksar was suddenly surrounded with dark mana as the spell was completed and fell to its knees, in obvious pain as its skin seemed to bloat outward. Jan impaled the Iksar through the neck as it writhed in pain.<br><br>&quot;Wha- that spell was supposed to kill it! Why didn't it work?&quot;, the gnome necromancer exclaimed.<br>&quot;Who cares, lets finish these two off!&quot; Thenen said quickly.<br><br>As he turned his head back to the Iksar he hastily tryed to parry a blow from it's odd weapon yet failed as he was unaccustomed to its useage. His sword broke in half, and in a moment the Iksar had slashed thrice more, one at the legs, causing him to fall to his knees, then at the chest, blood split all over the ship as the final blow to the neck finished his existance on Norrath. Jan flew into a rage and swung wildly, fear, hate, and anger burning in his eyes as he fought the last two off. The gnomish cleric and necromancer casting thier spells behind him seemed to be an eternity away as he fought with strength he had not ever felt before. The Iksar sought to use this against the gnome as they stepped out of reach of the gnome's blade and knocked over two lanterns, setting the boat ablaze in the middle of the sea. They smiled fanged grins as they dove over the side of the burning ship, their mission accomplished. Jan feel to his knees, sobbing as he held his brother's body to his chest, blood staining his armor. The Necromancer ran to the side of this burning ship and shouted:<br><br>&quot;Iksar hear my words! You shall pay for your offenses against my people! You shall pay for my families loss! You will learn to fear the sound of my name! I Azuthe shall hunt down every last one of you and slay you where you stand!&quot;<br><br>The Burning ship began to sink as the gnomes frantically tryed to put the flames out.<br><br><br>Far out to sea the Iksar known as Xarnth looked to the other hunter to his left. Eiczk would need to hear about these gnomes, but they would not survive the night.<br><br>Azuthe (Name Pending) <br>Gnome Necromancer <br>Former 24th Circle of the Dark Arts<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Feb 27 23:02:58 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hidden behind the wooded crest of a hill, the two young adventurers gazed intently at the dwarf camp hidden among the mountains of Faydwer.<br><br>&quot;Who are they?&quot; whispered Arione.<br><br>&quot;Bandits,&quot; replied Gorfrey in hushed tones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Former members of one of the mining guilds in Kaladim who have strayed from the true path of Brell.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can we take them?&quot; asked Arione.  The young wood elf was clearly eager to pick a fight.<br><br>The somewhat older dwarf scatched his beard thoughtfully.  &quot;I don't know - there are many of them, and they are skilled in combat.  I think we will both have to use magic.  I will lull those two in the tents, and you will have to root the one with the wooden leg.  Then we can take take the one on the far right.&quot;  <br><br>&quot;I understand. Then repeat with the others?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yes, then we can work our way through the lot of them.&quot;  Gorfrey smiled at his new friend.  This young ranger was eager to learn from him, and had proved an adept student.<br><br>&quot;Let us begin then,&quot; said Arione as he crawled forward over the crest of the hill, remaining carefully hidden from view.  <br><br>Gorfrey quietly invoked the power of Brell, and two of the bandits were lulled into a semi-conscious stupor.  He then rose and fired an arrow into the shoulder of the closest bandit.  <br><br>The bandit cried out in pain.  Nearby, the bandit leader Peg Leg saw Gorfrey and drew his dagger from its sheath.  As he started to run, vines near his feet slowly wrapped themselves around his ankles, slowing him down.<br><br>Seeing his successful spell take affect, Arione drew back his own arrow and let it fly, striking the bandit Gorfrey had wounded.  He then quickly drew a second one and watched with satisfaction as it struck the writhing bandit in the leg.<br><br>Cursing and in pain, the bandit struggled up the hill and closed upon Gorfrey and Arione.<br><br>Unknown to them, Qued had been sleeping off the previous evening's drinking in the bushes where he had fallen after passing out.  The screams of his fellow highwaymen caused the hung-over dwarf to suddenly awake with a start.  <br><br>Realizing he was behind them and that they did not see him, Qued leaped onto the back of the elven ranger, slashing with his dagger.  Arione reacted quickly, grabbing his sword and shield as he kicked the shorter dwarf in the chest.<br><br>Gorfrey now had two of the bandits attacking him, and a third was running towards him.  &quot;Arione!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Cast the root spell NOW!&quot;  <br><br>Nothing.  &quot;ARIONE!&quot; Gorfrey bellowed as the third dwarf bandit ran up and started pounding on the paladin with his fists. <br><br>&quot;I'm here!  There was another one we didn't see!&quot; replied the ranger as he blocked Qued's thrusts with his shield.<br><br>&quot;Run, Arione!  Save yourself!&quot; Gorfrey shouted as he slashed a bandit deeply across the chest, causing him to drop lifelessly to the ground.  Two more to go.  <br><br>Run to where? thought Arione as he suddenly realized he had no idea where he was.  Gorfrey had led him to the camp, and now he had no idea which way to go.  Seeing a stone tower in the distance, Arione sprinted towards it with both Qued and a female dwarf following close behind.<br><br>Gorfrey had slain yet another of the bandits, but he was quickly tiring and had taken a lot of punishment.  He knew that a dwarven guard post was not too far away, but he also knew that it was highly likely he would run into goblins along the way.  He staggered along the path, knowing that he would have to chance it.  Luckily, the goblin camp was deserted. <br><br>Closely followed by two bandits, Gorfrey pounded on the door of the guard hut on the road to Kaladim.  &quot;Open the door!  The bandits are right behind me!&quot;<br><br>The door flew open and the heavily armored dwarven guards grabbed Gorfrey and threw him inside on the rug.  The bandits did not see them coming until it was too late.<br><br>After taking some time to recover from his wounds, Gorfrey thanked the guards for their kindness and care and set out again towards the now empty bandit camp.  <br><br>I must find Arione, he thought.  I hope he is safe.   <br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Gorfrey<br>Paladin of the 16th Season, Legions of Might<br>Zebuxoruk Server<br><br>Paladin of the 7th season<br>Test server<br>"Dark elves....

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The traveller spotted the inn across the great open expanse of the Western Common Lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;The light was on, and there seemed to be activity inside.  Maybe now I can get some rest, he thought.  The journey from Kaladim had been a long one. The young dwarven paladin Gorfrey was covered with sweat and dust as he strode through the door of the inn.<br><br>&quot;Barkeep, an ale, if you please,&quot; he shouted in a weary voice.  He dropped his packs upon the floor and clambered onto a stool.  <br><br>The barkeep eyed the young dwarf warily.  &quot;Here you go - that will be six silver pieces.  No tab here for you.&quot;<br><br>Shrugging off the attempted insult, Gorfrey didn't even bother to blow the foam off the top of the tankard as was his custom.  Taking a long deep drink, he slammed the empty mug back on the counter.  He quickly downed five more, after paying the barkeep in advance for all five.  Tired from his long voyage across the sea and not thinking about anything but his fatigue and the stout ales in front of him, the young paladin  did not see the hidden danger. <br><br>&quot;I have travelled far and I am weary. Do you have a room for me?  Or is my money no good to you, sir?&quot; <br><br>&quot;We have a room for you,&quot; the barkeep said ominously.  &quot;But first you will have to speak to Zytl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And who is Zytl?  Is he the innkeeper?&quot; the dwarf asked, beginning to sense through his alcoholic fog that something was amiss.<br><br>Just then the dark elf dragoon Zytl burst through the door behind the dwarf.  Gorfrey had not quite gotten his trusty bastard sword out of its sheath when the sneering Zytl stuck his first blow, and then his second.  Slowed by the alcohol and weakened by his wounds, Gorfrey staggered out the door and began to flee towards the road where he had seen a human guard post.  <br><br>If I can make it to the guards, surely they will protect me, he thought.  Just a little further.<br><br>Sure enough, the toll booth and its gate loomed ahead of him in the darkness.  Collapsing at the feet of one of the guards, Gorfrey gasped &quot;Dark elf... attacked me... please....&quot;<br><br>The guard fingered his Freeport Militia tunic and looked down at the slowly dying dwarf.  He looked up to see the dark elf coming to finish the job.<br><br>&quot;Save yourself, paladin,&quot; the guard muttered.  &quot;Where is your god Brell now?&quot;<br><br>/OOC on<br><br>Pusbag,<br><br>Sorry it took so long to respond to your post on my journal.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The Iksar and the Troll spent a fortnight traveling through the Dreadlands and then the Burning Woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iksar Gezz had given Pusbag permission to use his magical skill.  Of course, this was to defend Gezz only.  Pusbag was delighted to put his shamanistic talents to use once again, without fizzles no less, and proceeded to slaughter a large feast for himself.<br><br>As they traveled, the Burning Woods soon gave way to a rocky, desolate landscape.  The sky burned with red fire.  Dark clouds hung above the two travelers.  The sky itself seemed to burn.  Pusbag and Gezz climbed higher into the rocks, and soon found themselves tranversing around pools and fissures of magma.  The molten rock added to their trevails and they progressed slowly.<br><br>&quot;Gezz, where are we, I have not been to these lands?&quot;, Pusbag asked his companion.<br><br>&quot;These are the Skyfire Mountains of Kunark.  Only the greatest adventurers come to these lands, the bravest souls.  Perhaps you will have a chance to test your bravery this day.&quot;, Gezz replied as he leaned on his staff.  <br><br>No sooner had he finished when a screaching cry rose from the east.  Pusbag turned and to his astonishment saw a drake flying rapidly in their direction.  Instead of the normal leathery wings possesed by most dragonkind, this one had four clear wings, much like a monstrous dragonfly.  The beast flew in low and attacked Pusbag with it's massive claws.<br><br>Gezz shouted,&quot;A chormadrac, fight!&quot;, and began to cast a spell.  The beast slashed and hacked at Pusbag.  Some of the strikes got through, but, the Troll had faced greater foes in the past.  He cast choking spell on the chromadrac, but it resisted and cast a spell of it's own!  Pusbag could feel his blood begin to boil.  Soon his entire body was filled with intense pain.  As Gezz's spells took effect, the beast slowed down.  Enraged, while at the same time enjoying his pain, Pusbag began to land crushing blows against the beasts flank.  It fell from the sky and two of it's wings were rended on the sharp rocks.  Gezz sent a bolt of magic into the drake as Pusbag delivered a final blow with his mace.  <br><br>As the chromadrac breathed it's last, Pusbag sat down and began to rock back and forth in agony.  The spell the creature had cast still boiled thoughout the blood in his body.  Gezz walked over and cast several spells on the Troll and soon the enchantment faded.  <br><br>After awile Pusbag looked at him shrwedly and plainly stated,&quot;You are no Iksar, you are an enchanter!  I know you!  You are....&quot;.  <br><br>Pusbag had no chance to finish.  Suddenly the world faded before the two adventurers.  Pusbag felt himself flying over the landscape, bumping off of rocks, tumbling through the air.  He and the Iksar were promptly dropped to the ground at the feet of a large Dragon.  The Dragon's skin was green and dulled with age, yet power emenated from it.  It also possesed four clear wings, like those of the chromadrac, but was much larger and fearsome.<br><br>The Dragon hissed, it's breath stinking and virulent,&quot;What brings lesser beings here, to slay my kin?&quot;.  The Dragon rested it's gaze upon Pusbag and Gezz as they stood up.<br><br>Gezz spoke,&quot;Eldrig the Old, I bring you treaties from the Empire of the Iksar.&quot;, Gezz stated as he bowed slowly,&quot;Would you here this message?&quot;<br><br>Eldrig thought for a moment,&quot;Speak you words, scaled one, the other will remain silent in my precense, lest I slay him.&quot;, the Dragon looked closely at Pusbag, who in turn did not move.<br><br>Gezz spoke,&quot;I have been sent by none other than Grandmaster Glox, the newly appointed leader of Cabilis.  Our words are this:  The Iksar have long suffered from our defeat at the hands of Dragonkind.  Yet, from this suffering we have learned a most valuable lesson, patience.  Long have we waited for the day when we would rise to power yet again, and our day has come.  The nations of sofskins fall before us and our power grows.  Yet Dragonkind dissapear from history.  They venture forth no more.  They waste away in the homes and lairs.  Kunark belongs to the empire of the Iksar, and we will have it no other way.  Cabilis demands the surrender of all Dragonkind on Kunark.  They are to leave within a fortnight, leaving behind all their stolen treasures; otherwise they will suffer the wrath of the Iksar!&quot;<br><br>Gezz finished his stunning pronouncement by spitting on the ground at the foot of Eldrig.  Pusbag began to slowly back off.  This Iksar, or what ever he is, was clearly quite insane.  Eldrig did not move for nearly a minute.  His skin began to turn a deeper shade of green and his eyes glowed with hatred.<br><br>Gezz turned to Pusbag,&quot;Run you stupid Troll, you services are ended!  Seek your vengeance or become a slave to the Iksar!  Do not let your ambition lead to disgrace again!  Run!&quot;.<br><br>Gezz turned and began casting a spell at Eldrig.  Eldrig sent a tremendous bolt of power into the Iksar.  Gezz's spell sent a flash of colors into the air about Eldrig, blinding and stunning him.  Pusbag summoned up the spirit of the wolf and began to run.  And run he did, faster than he ever had before.  Behind him, he could here the thunder of spells as Eldrig and Gezz fought each other.  Pusbag was free of his geas, for a moment he thought of his revenge, his justice.  Quickly thoughts of vengence were replaced by fear and he ran even faster.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A small gnome sat down by the coast of the oasis, darkness already falling as the sun set behind mountains of sand. He could feel the sand cooling gradually under him as he lit his lantern and began to attempt to decipher the Tier'Dal book he had found. He fliped through the pages slowly, making notes on the translations in his native tongue in as many places as possible. He finally recognized one of the spells as a spell which would summon a skeletal servent of so medicore strength.<br><br>&quot;Now why would any inteligent necromancer have such a low power spell in a book with all these spells I can't even hope to understand?&quot;<br><br>With a lack of anything better to do, the gnome began to slowly copy the spell into his own book, in his own tongue. He stood to cast the spell, darklines of mana flowing around his body as he chanted the spell. He tossed the chips of bones on the ground to serve as the focus for the spell and said the final binding words...<br><br>Nothing happened.<br><br>He stared at the pile of bone chips on the ground as the mana feld the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;His spell hadn't fizzled, he knew that, he had said the words exactly at they were written.  He compared the writings in the two books again, and swearing quietly, wishing he had spent more time listening when he had been taught the dark tongue. Suddenly he heard a noise behind him and spun around to see an orc dressed in platemail running at him full tilt. He began casting the spell again, hoping it would work and the servent would engage the orc as he cast other spells. The dark lines of mana flowed again from his hands wrapping around his body. He completed the spell just as the orc reached him and nearly fainted from shock as the orc seemed to explode into flying mass of gore and blood, splattering the little gnome and all of his things.<br><br>&quot;What in the name of.....&quot;<br><br>The gnome stopped as before him stood a skeleton dressed in Platemail, standing ready and at his command.  The gnomes jaw dropped.<br><br>&quot;Is this what I-Did that orc just-WOW!&quot;<br><br>The gnome grabbed his quill and began to write in his thankfully not-so-bloody spellbook, writing notes on the incantation, not resting until the sun had nearly risen.<br><br>The gnome thought to himself as he prepared to sleep in one of the many hunts along the oasis,<br><br>'Tomorrow I shall begin my travel to Kurnak and with the aid of this spell, the Iksar will be sorry they ever existed in Norrath!'<br><br>With that final thought in mind he slowly drifted to sleep.<br><br>Azuthe (Name Pending) <br>Gnome Necromancer <br>Former 24th, now 23rd again Circle of the Dark Arts<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Feb 20 17:04:01 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc on<br><br>The tapestry is disturbing not because of the content, which every broodling should be quite accustomed to, but due to the unusual hues woven into the fabric.&nbsp;&nbsp;Call it a bit of psychological warfare, if you will, since the guest would always be facing the tapestry when in conference with Usula.<br><br>/ooc off<br><br>Usula examined both of the documents Eiczk handed to her, and grumbled a curse directed at Glosk.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;As always, Eiczk, you are brave and honest in your questions and the voicing of your opinion.  However, the line between intelligent questions and impertinence is fine,<i> and you would do well not to cross it.</i>&quot;</span style='color: green;'>  Usula's voice indicated more than words the danger Eiczk had come close to with his words.  Nevertheless, Usula visibly calmed herself, <span style='color: green;'>&quot;I shall answer your questions.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your father and mother were both sent to be killed for a very simple reason.  I cannot say I agree with the judgment, but I also cannot question the timeless wisdom involved.  Simply, your family wished to raise you.&quot;</span style='color: green;'>  Usula paused at Eiczk's startled expression.  <span style='color: green;'>&quot;Think about it, most intelligent one.  Can you name any in the Legion raised by their actual parents?  Can you think of any in the Brood who know who their parents are?  I tell you truth, young one, the Shaman make sure that the youth are raised by the society as a whole, not by individual parents.  True, we can take on the name of the clutch, and thus your surname of Draygoner, and I have taken the name Wurmbane.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, we are both descended from families who have challenged dragons.  Further than this, I fear I do not know the answer you seek.  I do not know why Glosk targets your family, though nothing surprises me with that viper.  Perhaps your mother was a great necromancer, and that is the reason he had her killed.&quot;</span style='color: green;'>  Usula raised her eyes, <span style='color: green;'>&quot;Have you never noticed that there are no female members of the Brood of Kotiz in power, excepting myself?&quot;</span style='color: green;'>  <br><br>Eiczk blurted out &quot;Well, if what you imply is true, <b>HOW</b> are you alive?&quot;<br><br>Usula's eyes fogged for a moment before she responded.  <span style='color: green;'>&quot;I was taken far from Cabilis at the time when my power was developing, and by the time I returned, Glosk found he could not challenge me any longer.  Still, however, there are few females in the Brood of Kotiz.  Perhaps that is a fact due to the manipulations of the gods, I do not know.&quot;</span style='color: green;'>  Though Eiczk was intrigued, knowing there had to be more to the tale, he did not question Usula further.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;If you wish, I can look into the matter of your parents death further, and into the nature of your family name.&quot;</span style='color: green;'>  Eiczk nodded.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;In answer to your second question, I do not know what machinations that Harbinger Glosk has in store for your family.  He will not challenge me, however, and I would have you at my side.&quot;</span style='color: green;'>  Usula gave a non-committal shrug.  <span style='color: green;'>&quot;If you are asking what I want from you, well, the answer should be plain.  You are perhaps one of the most capable of the Legion, possessing not only great skill, but also an abiding intelligence that makes you more dangerous than your brothers.  Such a one can be a valuable ally in making Cabilis great once more.  I dream of Cabilis, Eiczk, and think you share the same dream.  If I did not think so, <i>you would be dead now</i>.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>Usula paused to take a sip from her drink.  Eiczk realized it was fruit juice.  He did not know why he found it strange, but now that he reflected on it, he had never seen Usula drink anything other than water or fruit juice, and for that matter, had never seen her eat anything but roots and vegetables (though she had served meat often enough).  Odd how such thoughts come to one at the most peculiar times.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;Your last question demonstrates what I mean.  Though I should have Prime Heirophant Vek killed for assuming to meddle in <b>MY</b> affairs, I suppose I shall drop that consideration, for now.  What do I plan to do <i>with Trakanon?  What do I plan to do with the dragons?</i>  Can you not guess by my surname?  I <b>am</b> Usula Wurmbane&quot;</span style='color: green;'> This was said in a haughty voice <span style='color: green;'>&quot;and I shall forever thirst after dragonblood.  They must be absolutely and utterly destroyed!&quot;</span style='color: green;'>  she responded to her own words with such venom that her eyes seemed to glow.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;I believe we are done here for the moment Legionnaire.  Wait here while I scribe a note to War Baron Eator, and then return to me on the morrow.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>Usula grabbed a parchment and a quill and began to write a letter<br><br><BLOCKQUOTE><b id=fs8>Quote:</b><hr size=1><br>Most Honorable War Baron Eator,<br><br>Greetings.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It was during Pusbag's young teen years that he had his first significant experience with outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unkk and Pusbag had been playing with the skellies near the decrepit tower when they found themselves in a situation which overwhelmed their budding skills as magic users.  A giant water moccassin had bitten Pusbag after he and Unkk were slightly beat up from a nasty duel with a skeleton.  The snake had aggroed on the Trolls while fending off the skel's slashing sword.  Pusbag took a step backwards from the force of the blow and placed a foot on the normally placid viper's neck.  As soon as Pusbag's foot released the snake, it reared up and bit him three quick times in succession.<br><br>Unkk lopped off the head of the skeleton and proceeded to fend off the snake while Pusbag cast a series of heals on himself, but to no avail.  The poison was coursing through his veins weakening him to the point where he was becoming lightheaded.<br><br>All of a sudden, as darkness enveloped him he saw a glimpse of a young human woman's face and a soft cloth being placed on his wounds.  Within moments a large portion of his health returned, but the deadly venom was still knocking down his health.  Another bandage was administered to the bites.  More health returned.<br><br>Unkk had just finished off the snake and saw a hated foreigner-- a human! --bending over his best friend doing what for all he knew was inflicting a vicious wound that meant certain death to Pusbag.  As he screamed out in rage at the unexpected attack on his friend he raced over to assist Pusbag in repelling the invader.  In the blink of an eye he found himself on his back with his whole body numb and unable to move.  He blacked out shortly thereafter.<br><br>Angiisan moved back over to the hurting Troll.  She had no idea why she felt compelled to help a monster like this enormous Troll, but something inside her moved her hands to stop the poison from ending the life of the hideous creature.  She skillfully bound his wounds and nursed him back to the land of the living, all the while keeping him pinned to the ground by her knee.<br><br>For some mysterious reason, Pusbag was utterly at the mercy of the helpful woman since he was singularly unable to get to his feet.  However, that wasn't the only reason he remained still, she had an aura about her which calmed him, soothed him, and left him utterly content to lay on his back.  He lolled his head over and saw Unkk unconscious on the ground next to him.  &quot;Shhhhhh.  Your friend is fine-- just rest.  This poison will soon pass from your system and then you'll be free to go,&quot; he heard the woman quietly say.  As his strength returned, he slowly sat up.  The woman gracefully moved into a low crouch with one hand up in front of her body, the other poised to strike above her head.  Pusbag saw her foot lightly resting on its' toes in preparation to kick him under the chin and snap his head back.  He slowly showed her his empty palms to let her see he meant no harm when he realized she had spoken to him in his native tongue.  Amazed, he asked, &quot;<span style='color: green;'>Who are you?  And what are you doing here?  Why would you help me, a Troll?</span style='color: green;'>&quot;  <br><br>&quot;So many questions!&quot; she replied.  &quot;My name is Angiisan...&quot; and so one of the strangest episodes in Pusbag's life began as she explained what it was she was doing there in Innothule Swamp.<br><br>--Pusbag Infection<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

Knowing Da Swamp was filled with her species enemies, the Trolls, she had been careful not to attract the unwanted attention of the massive creatures while she harvested some Frogloks.  Yet when Angiisan had seen the plight of the hurting Trolls she felt some compassion and decided to intervene on their behalf.<br><br>Her bandaging skill saved Pusbag's life.  She always carried a large selection of aloe bandages (her favorites) and put them to use in healing the Troll's wounds.  If you asked her why she went out of her way to help a racial enemy she would have shrugged and told you it was an impulsive decision.  She was well known in her guild for thinking outside the box, which was also why she was a rising star in the Ashen Order.  An unconventional mind combined with deadly skill in unarmed combat made her a formidable foe.<br><br>&quot;Well, my two Trolls, where shall I begin?&quot; she asked.  &quot;Let me start at the beginning...&quot;<br><br>And with that she told her tale.  Trolls love a good story and sat raptly at attention as Angiisan wove an intricate plot of love, loss, and friendship.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&quot;I was born to a middle class merchant's family,&quot; Angiisan said, &quot;and led a normal childhood life for the most part.&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents were loving and in love, and took every opportunity to spend time together.  They doted on me and my siblings, yet were gently disciplining when we strayed too far from the rules they set out for us.  All in all it was a wonderful life we led in Freeport.  Father made a good living making and selling coats to rich and poor folks, Mother stayed at home and gave us a nurturing safe place to grow.<br><br>However, unlike my three brothers and two sisters, it seemed I was always seeing life from a different perspective.  Early on I was drawn to the martial arts with the high flying kicks, acrobatic leaps, and the lightning quick kata.  Every day after schooling I would be found haunting the yard in front of the Ashen Order watching the Masters in front practicing their craft.  I would try to follow them move for move, day in, day out, until the Guild Master called upon my parents one evening and asked to be given the opportunity to personally train me.  <br><br>He must have been convincing, because my parents called me into the kitchen and told me I was being given permission to join with the Order when I finished with my schooling.  I was to enter the guild as a novice and begin training as a monk!  <br><br>It was the best time of my life-- I was allowed to return home at night to my family after a long excitement-filled day of martial art training.  The Master exposed me to techniques that Grandmaster Bo had developed centuries earlier, methods which included staves, knives, chain, unarmed combat, and improvised weaponry.  Later, I was shown magical kata that involved disciplines in basic natural forces: stone, wind, water, light.  <br><br>The Master honed my innate abilities and expanded my repetoire, which in turn moved me up in the guild standings.  I was given special assignments which utilized the various techniques of sneaking, hiding, feigning death, among others.&quot;<br><br>*to be continued*<br>--Pusbag Infection<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Pusbag now had been under the spell of the lizard, Gezz, for many days-- weeks perhaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seemed to drag on as he followed his master through Kunark killing indiscriminately at the whim of his &quot;owner&quot;.<br><br>He had one thing to be grateful for and that was that due to the enormous amount of death he dispensed upon any living thing they came across, the iksar had allowed him to feed freely upon the corpses.  His stomach no longer growled constantly and he in return ended the lives of a proportionate number of victims for his master.<br><br>Pusbag noted that there was a small part of him which was not given over to the iksar who commanded his actions, a part which objectively analyzed his behavior and movements.  It was this tiny piece of free will that Pusbag hoarded like it was a gem of enormous price.  He refused to relinquish this bit of his spirit and hid it from the scaly creature manipulating him.<br><br>*************************************************************<br><br>Gezz the Iksar enjoyed playing with the Troll, making him do as he chose, especially knowing that it would cause Pusbag's teeth to grind if he were able to make such a movement on his own-- which, pleasingly, he wasn't!  It was a wonder to see this extraordinarily powerful Troll kill various creatures with a style of fighting unlike anything he had ever seen or even heard of.  The giant Troll combined a weapon style with a rare unarmed combat kata, which rendered him virtually undefeatable in a fight.  He marveled at the fortune of whoever had luck to bring Pusbag to where he was today-- in his geas.  Whoever it was must have barely escaped with his life, since to face this deadly Troll was like entering the Arena unarmed versus a squadron of enraged spectres intent on evicerating you. <br><br>He noticed the Troll was hungry by the coveteous eyes he cast on his victims, so he granted permission to the Troll to take his fill.  Watching him eat, the iksar's jaw dropped at the prodigious appetite of the colossal Troll.  He ate continually and with abandon, as if he expected to never take a bite of food ever again.  Incredible!<br><br>Thinking about the present situation, Gezz was grateful that the Troll was unable to cast his magical spells since that would mean he had regained his will.  Yikes!  The thought of facing Pusbag intent on revenge using <i>all of his skills-- combat and magical</i>, was one which caused an involuntary shiver to pass down his spine.  And for a creature as an Iksar, fear was an emotion that they as a race were most unfamiliar with.  What an uncomfortable feeling!  He was glad he was a member of the superior race and one who had Usula to lead them into glory.  It was inevitable for the iksar to rule.  It was destiny!<br><br>On this thought, he shrugged off the taint of fear and commanded his Troll to follow.  They had a destination to get to and all this introspection served no purpose but to delay his plans.  He would soon see if Pusbag's weapons prowess were the match for a dragon.<br><br>Destiny.  <i>This</i> was a thought on which the iksar should spend energy.  Soon, very soon they would do what this <i>mere</i> Troll could not do-- rule the world.<br><br>--Pusbag Infection <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Feb 19 15:45:40 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Culris proceeded to his private quarters, beneath the grotto of the keeper's hidden from any prying eyes within New Sebilis. It was there he would meet the three, and begin their dark enchantments.<br>Many saw Culris round Cabilis, and only thought he was a slave to Usula, at beck and call, or the most, he was mearly a jumped up spy who dabbled in the dark arts. However, Culris possesed much knowledge, and in his travels, he had encountered many a fasinating tome, containing scriptures about the nature of each race, including the trolls and the elves. From this he gained the knowledge that there is only one type of elf.<br>This was shocking to him, but as he read more, he began to understand, for elves are muich like gems, turn them, move them, and you will see different shapes and colours, but it will still be the same thing. Such were elves, the High Elves were the side that was noble, and wise, the Wood Elves were natureous and loving for all that lived, and the Dark Elves were cunning, plotting and intelligent. However, since the begining, Innoruk seperated out these parts, and watered them down with the blood of the humans, and so this oneness was lost, and the elves began feuding with each other, no longer a one people, but many races, each different. But there in lied the answer to the question, how do you destroy and elf? Since elves are immortal, they cannot die truely, they can be killed, and certainly, their bodies can be burned, but they will simply be born again, in a new, strong body, but the same spirit will endure. No, to kill an elf, you must destroy the spirit, and in one of the darkest tomes, in the blackest dungeons, in the most evil of lands, he had found how to do this. Indeed, the knowledge had very nearly cost him his life, since tomes such as these do not give secrets easily.<br>Entering the room of incantation within his quarters, he saw already the Three has assembled, each acknowledging him with a slight nod. They had been busy, for the circle of Rites had been drawn, the the three corners defined. There only remained the components, and the spell itself.<br>&quot;You have what i sent each to get yes?&quot; He queried<br>&quot;Aye&quot; each replied and presented him, in turn, with a corked up vial, and each he placed in a rack. One was filled with a emerald leaf green, a pure colour of nature, the blood of a Fier'Dal druid, a priest among the Fier'Dal. The second was filled with pure black, that seemed to glow, if such a thing was possible. This black was not the matt black of deadness, but was a black that was alive in its feeling, an example of pure darkness, taken from a Tier'Dal priest or Innoruk, a necromancer. The third vial contained a reddish pink substance, not bright pink, but the pink of new born flesh of the humans. This was the blood of the Homodia'Dal, half elves, and from a paladin, holy knight who linked Tunare and the Marr twins in an alliance. When all three were placed in the rack, Culris removed the fourth vial, that was secreated about his person. This was the blue blood he took from the evoker of the Koada'Dal. He placed this in the last slot of the rack, and carried it to the center with him.<br>&quot;Take your daggers, and form the circle&quot;<br>Each of the three took station on one of the points, on the outer edge of the circle, where the three corners had been drawn. Once they had, they began to chant, cerimonial daggers in hand, and sawying in motion. Culris donned his black robe, and took position in the centre of the cirlce. Although there were no instruments, the air seemed to fill with beats rom drums, deep and filled with bass.<br>&quot;I call upon the dark powers!&quot; the chanting contined the word powers<br>&quot;I call upon the unholy trinity&quot;<br>&quot;trinity, trinty, trinity...&quot;<br>&quot;Innoruk, Brextoxxilos, Cazic-Thule!&quot;<br>&quot;Thule Thule, Thuel...&quot;<br>&quot;Take this offerings, and make them into what they should be!&quot;<br>&quot;be, be, be, be...&quot;<br>&quot;Hear us, head our call&quot;<br>&quot;call, call, call..&quot;<br>&quot;Give us, as trust us, as we trust YOU!&quot;<br>And with the call, each necromancer thrust their dagger into their heart, and fell, as totally darkness filled the whole room.<br>When they awoke, many hours later, the four necromancers found their daggers stabbed far into the ground, one at the end of each point, and Culris' in the exact centre of the room. And, balancing on the hilt of the centre dagger was...<br>Light, pure white light, captured within a vial of liquid.<br>&quot;What is it..?&quot; one of the Three whispered<br>Laughing out, Culris answered<br>&quot;It's what we asked for! There is only one way to kill and elf, and that is with the blood of the true elf! This is what we have, Dal Blood, or as it will be Dal Bane! They took our offerings and combined them! We have the key to the downfall of the elven races!&quot;<br>With that, he grabbed the vial, and wrenched his dagger from the ground. Then he put a bung in the vial's end, and hid it among his robe and left his chambers, still leaving the Three there, to contemplate what had happened, and to clean up the chalk and candles..<br>&nbsp;<br>Culris Wurmbane<br>Lord of the Brood<br>Mithaniel Marr</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The return to Cabilis, while without great fanfare, was truly a triumph for Usula.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she would never say it, she was most pleased with the competent and capable warrior Eiczk proved himself to be.  Truly, she thought, her trust in the legionnaire was not misplaced.  She hoped he would find some small use for the token reward she had given him, but his occasional scowls only produced a fit of chuckling in her.<br><br>In Cabilis, after she had dismissed Eiczk to whatever entertainment he wished to partake of, Usula met with Culris.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;The Tier Dal are as arrogant as I had expected.  It was sheer ease that allowed my party to sneak into Neriak and steal some of their precious journals on Necromancy.  I think we shall benefit greatly in the knowledge of their arts.'</span style='color: green;'>  Usula stated.<br><br>Culris examined the texts and had to grudgingly admit that the knowledge contained therein was new, even for practiced members of the Brood of Kotiz.  They would add much power to the Iksar, of that he was sure.<br><br>Usula went on to describe the layout of the city in detail, including the general layout of the land, the guard posts, and the most prominent members and guild leaders.  All of this was valuable information if Culris was to pull off the plan he had so long worked to complete.  When her report was complete, Usula retired to her personal chambers in order to study some of the works she had taken.  Her personal interest was taken by the book <i>Mind Wrack and the Essence of Magic</i> by one Lyxol X&amp;#8217;Tempo.  Apparently, the Tier Dal necromancer had discovered a way to steal the manna essence of an individual creature and spread it out to up to six companions.  Usula wondered how this spell could be used in conjunction with a contingent of Shadow Knights and Shaman (vile creatures they may be, but still Iksar) against a highly magical foe.  Usula wondered if the spell would work, and if they would work against Dragons.  She studied the text the entire night and well into the next day before finally exiting her chambers.<br><br>Summoning a skeletal monk pet named Xabober, she sent him off to fetch Eiczk to her chambers.  At that time, Eiczk was in the Field of Bone, overseeing several young recruits.  He was not surprised, however, at the summons of the necromancer.  With determination mixed with a small amount of dread, he entered into her chambers.<br><br>She was seated on the floor, as was her custom, in the reception room.  Looming above her was the tapestry showing the defeat of the Iksar so long ago.  Eiczk had never become used to the unsettling tapestry.  With a flick of her wrist and a glance from her poison green eyes, Usula gestured for Eiczk to sit across from her.  Seeing no way to politely refuse, he did as he was bidden.  Usula was drinking something from a flask, and offered him a cup.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;I believe you are now worthy, Eiczk.  You are both brave and knowledgeable, a very commendable combination.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc sorry this one is so long, but I got to writing, and just couldn't stop. I hope everyone enjoys this. and for those monty python fans, please excuse the inclusion of a line from the quest for the Holy Grail. I was watching it while writing this. And on a side note.. the depection of the fall of sebilis does not really make Eiczk uncomfortable, as you will soon see. its the possibility of a recurrance of that event that does. No biggie, just so you know. /ooc off<br><br>Two Iksar stood by the water's edge, both with swords in hand. One old, One young. Side by side they stood still as statues. Each was stripped to the waist, Their armor set aside. Without warning both moved in unison, swinging their blades in a tight arc, then reversing it and swinging upwards. Again they stood still. Their blades stood at ready, out perpendicular to their bodies, both hands on the hilt. They both spun to the left, and swung in a wide arc, a blow that would decapitate any bipedal being of their size. Again stillness came. &quot;Ready the blades!&quot; called the old one. &quot;The blades are ready.&quot; answered the young. They both begain striking and dodging, moving through various sword strikes and ripostes. All the while in unison with the other. To them time moved like a river over flat ground: Slow and even. To others watching it would seem a whirlwind of movement and color. Just as quickly as they began, they stopped. Blades were again at the ready. &quot;Sheathe your honor, young one.&quot; said the Elder. Both closed their stance bringing legs together, swords moved from the ready position as the two slid them into their scabbards. The old and the young both stood upright, hand on hilt, staring towards the water. as one the two intoned: &quot;<I><span style='color: green;'>May fear guide our spirit and our blades. Honor to the fallen in combat, death to those who fail in it. For Sebilis, our honor is always ready.</span style='color: green;'></I>&quot; An old saying brought new again. An old warrior raising the new.<br><br>&quot;Do you know what you ended up standing in?&quot; the younger one said with a smile. &quot;Oh shut up Eiczk. I know all bloody well what I am in. If I ever find the Burynai that left this, I will have a new pelt to hang on my wall.&quot; <br><br>War Baron Eator was an older Iksar, tall lithe and scarred heavily. He moved off of the mess, scraping his foot through the sand. Eiczk just laughed. &quot;Well old friend perhaps if you had watched your turnings instead of that bird up on the ledge, you would have spaced yourself to avoid ... putting your foot in it, shall I say?&quot; With a growl Eator moved off towards the gulley that led back up to the remainder of the Field of Bone.&quot;I can't help it.. I'm hungry.&quot; The younger iksar grabbed their armor and walked along side him. &quot;M'lord, I thank you for practicing with me. It was enjoyable as always.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Must you always be so formal all the time, hatchling? as if we had not known each other for many years now. I could count on one hand the number of times you have slipped and called me old friend. Perhaps even minus a few fingers.&quot; Replied the War Baron. Eiczk sighed, casting his eyes downards. &quot;Yes, sire, it must be. You are the War Baron of Cabilis, leader of the Legion. I am a Legionnaire. Though we are friends as well, I still owe you the respect of your rank.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Very well you young whelp one day I'll get you to relax some, now lets head back. There are papers on my desk I have to dig through and sign. I would sooner face the Troll army than that, but it must be done.&quot; <br><br>The two walked up into the field, circumventing the pit, as it was shorter. A lone skeleton came running in their direction. &quot;Oh boy, more practice.. looks like those papers get to wait.&quot; Said the Baron excitedly as he unsheathed his sword. The younger stayed his hand seeing something the elder did not. Eiczk had been known to have very sharp eyes. &quot;No that is not a skelton from the pit. That is a servant of a necromancer. Looks like one of us is needed.&quot; The skeleton stopped and began chittering away as if they could understand. How they made that noise without any larynx was till a boggle to both. Since both looked at the creatured with confused stares, the skeleton grabbed Eickz's arm, and pulled him. Eiczk slid his sword out of its sheath, swinging upwards and removing the skeletons arm. The cadaver stared at the bones on the ground. With his blade held high, he spun backwards, bringing the blade around with considerable force. Force that severed the head of the skeleton, and released the incantations that held it to the mortal plane. &quot;Well it looks like we know who is summoned, M'lord. I do so believe you have those papers to sign, and I have to go see Usula.&quot; The War Baron nodded and started off to cabilis. A group of Partisans that had been standing on the ledge above the ocean formed up on the War Baron as escort. The War Baron began lecturing them on the forms he and Legionnaire Draygoner were using. Eiczk dashed off ahead of them.<br><br>Arriving back in fortress Talishan, Eiczk stopped momentarily to grab some bloodwater to cool himself. He also removed a small bundle from his quarters. A calm feeling had come over him. Of all the things he enjoyed doing, He loved practicing with Eator. Even if it was to train recruits. The baron had sort of taken him in when his father and mother were killed. At the time he was only 7. To Eiczk, though he remembered his father, It was Eator whom he believed took the role. When he arrived In the Tower of Death. Usula was waiting.<br><br>Her question was like striking a brick wall. Very uncomfortable. He had come to ask questions given the light of the most recent events, but had not expected this. Despite the discomfort, he maintained a cold expression. &quot;First Usula there are things you must know, if you do not know them already.&quot; He removed his sword, Laying it upon the ground. It was a long sword, Blade almost as thick as the Quilions, tapered to a sharp point. The blade appeared as metal, but somehow seemed harder. Upon the hilt was a large black scale. Usula had seen this blade before. Along with the two Ykeshen short swords tucked behind his belt, this comprised part of the arsenal of weapons he mainly used. &quot;This blade has been in my family since after the fall of Rile. It has passed from father to son down countless generations. Before Rile we were slaves to the evil of Venril Sathir. Taken from the Jarsath tribe and forced to work in the forges that founded Sebilis. After Sathir fell, and Rile became Emperor, we were freed. He gave us a name... Sh'ethok. Translated from the ancient language of the Soriz.. Forge Keepers. We stayed in service of Rile, and forged the armors and weapons that would eventually be used during the war against the Dragons. We were however still considered slaves, and were not allowed to serve in any of the guilds. <br><br>The Sebilisan people laughed at us, tormented us and slew our children out of spite. Then came the day that Rile died. His ship was beset and destroyed in a storm conjured by the dragons. Many were angry and wanted blood for his death. All they seemed to do was add their own to the mettle. One of my ancestors cared for Rile, and felt that his death would not go unanswered. He took a blade and led the sons of Sh'ethok out upon the battlefield. He was the eldest of my family. Many warriors laughed at them, some tried to scare them off. Unabated, they attacked the dragons as if Thule himself drove them. Of the 30 dragons that were there that day, only 2 left living. Not one of the Sh'ethok died. They swore to defend Sebilis until not one Dragon yet lived. That still stands today. Atrebe, Rile's son finally allowed them into the Warrior's guild. It was not long before many were leading our troops against the dragons. My Grandsire took that day a mighty claw and a scale from one of the fallen dragons.&quot; Eiczk touched the blade lightly, and it seemed to glow softly. &quot;He forged them both into this blade. My grandsire's name was Eiczk Sh'ethok, we just call him the Sh'ethok. <br><br>As my family grew in fame people began to fear them, and called them The Dragonslayers. Not one of my kin has ever fallen in combat against a dragon. They have all wielded this blade. After Sebilis fell and our people were scattered the meaning of the dragonslayers was lost. Soon the name was truncated to what we know today. Draygoner. This happened many many generations ago, and only the first born of our family is taught its history. My mother did not know the history back to Sh'ethok's day until later in my life. On my naming day, my father was out scouting and was not present to name me. My mother chose my name without any knowledge of its past. I am also not first born. I had an elder brother, of whom I will not speak. It is, however, enough to say that he no longer lives. <br><br><br>Even though my brother died after my father, My father taught me the history. I am the first to break our history, my mother said. None were to ever be named after our grandsire. I am. Only the firstborn are to know the history of our family. I am Secondborn. The sword of the Sh'ethok must be passed from Father to Firsborn Son. I took this blade from my brother's hands after he was killed.&quot; <br><br>Usula took all of this in like a sponge. &quot;This is most interesting, but what does it have to do with anything you wish to know?&quot;<br><br>Eiczk smiled. &quot;Quite simply, I have broken almost every tradition in our family. I intend to keep it that way. There is another tradition my family has, one I do not like. From father to son this blade has passed. The blade is passed when the Firstborn recieves his summons to the Guild appropriate for his abilities. For my brother that was from the Crusaders. In every generation back to the day of Sh'ethok, within a month of the sword being passed on, the Father is killed somehow. Also each generation, the mother disappears or dies at the same time. Not a single Draygoner has taken a wife that was not a necromancer. My mother and father were killed by a Giant Ambush in the Frontier Mountains. They had been told that the giants were fleeing the mountains, and to investigate the cause. When they arrived apparently the Giants were actually mounting an assault force. The gathering was well known by the guilds in Cabilis, but not informed to my parents.&quot; Eiczk reached behind him and pulled out the small package he brought with him. Out of it he pulled a dagger and old parchment. The dagger he laid beside his sword. The scroll he read aloud. <br>_________________________________<br><i><br>&quot;War Baron Eator<br>Fortress Talishan<br><br>Greetings to you Noble Eator,<br><br>I am writing to you to inform you of a joint venture between our guilds. As you know Trooper Draygoner has a wife within our guild. Since we have need of recon to the Frontier mountains you are to send Trooper Draygoner there post haste. Do not inform him of his mission. that I will leave to our representative His wife will acompany him as our representative.<br><br>I also reccomend you begin training his replacement as I feel that he will be moving on to better things after this assignment. This is not a request Eator, I cannot stress the urgency of this assignment.&quot; </i><br>_________________________________<br><br>He finished reading and looked at Usula. &quot;It is signed Harbinger Glosk.&quot; He tossed the paper at her feet. He then picked up the dagger. Upon the dagger's hilt there was a setting for some gem, but the gem appeared to be missing. &quot;This was given to my mother before they left. As you know we have Giants captive within the city repairing some of the damage they once caused.&quot; Eiczk pulled from the bag a small black pearl and placed it in the hilt of the dagger. The hilt looked identical to the ring Usula had given him. Immediately the dagger began to vibrate and emit a loud high pitched squeal. Soon the sound was intolerable and painful. The iksar removed the pearl, and the sound stopped. &quot;I have found that this dagger does this when within 10 metres of a Giant. There is a giant outside working on the tower at this minute. Harbinger Glosk gave this to my mother personally. From research I have done here in the tower it looks that the brood has had every male of my line killed back to the days of Rile. So what is it I want to know?&quot; Eiczk held up a finger &quot;One, why did the brood have my mother and father killed,&quot; Raising another finger, &quot;Two what does the brood intend of me, being of the Draygoner line, &quot; a third finger raised, &quot;and Three, what is it you wish of Trakanon?&quot; Usula looked shocked at him.<br><br>&quot;Ahh you see those books you had are very old. I am not a magic user, but I know the scripts used in Necromantic and Shamanistic practices. After all we have both guilds here, my mother was a Necromancer, and my little sister is a shaman. I will not disclose her name to you as I fear for her safety. Those books are neither. I have a good memory Usula, and remembered some of the script. Some Questions posed to the shaman proved most interesting. The script is Elder Elvish, and parts of it are Dragon speech as well. The names of the books were Mind Wrack and Essence of Sorcery according to Prime Hierophant Vek. He could be wrong. his dragon was rusty. He did mention that from what he heard of them, both books were in studies of draining mystical energy. Last time I checked we only have one foe that requres that potentency of magic, namely Trakanon and his friends. So, Usula I request that you answer these questions three. I would hate to see you become another Dag and be slain for studying forbidden arts. I also warn you, Dragons are my family's mortal foe. Ally yourself with them in any way and you make a foe of me. I must beg your forgiveness I almost forgot. I have something for you.&quot; He pulled a small parchment out of his armor, and handed it to her. it read as follows:<br>_________________________________<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>To Council Member Usula<br>  Tower of Death.<br><br>  Usula, <br><br>  It has come to my attention that as of late you have been using the Legion of Cabilis to further the goals of our empire. I applaud you and encourage you to continue. However, from this day forward any requests of military action must be approved by the council as a whole, not upon a whim of yours. I assign you as a Liaison, Legionnaire Eiczk Draygoner. If you have military requests Let him know as he represents the will of the Legion. I have notified Glox of this, and he has aggreed that military action will be decided in full council. <br><br>               <b>We will not be puppets anymore.</b><br><br>May Cazic grant you victory, <br><br>War Baron Eator</i><br>_________________________________<br><br>Fury seemed to roll off Usula in waves.<br><br>&quot;I trust that Eator was quite implicit in his instructions? Know this Usula, I do still serve you because your interests serve Cabilis, and because I like you. Eator will soon be too old to lead, and will be stepping down. I am one of three other candidates for that position. Though it would pain me to see you opposed, if you do take path with dragons in anyway, the legion will stand behind me against you. I ask that you answer me in truth now, I will not hate you for your interest in the dragons. Neither will I seek action against you so long as answer my questions with Honor and sincerity. <br><br>The Legionnaire waited patiently for her answer.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Feb 19 01:32:31 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Eiczk Draygoner<br>34th rank Warrior<br>Legionnaire of Cabilis<br>Xegony<br><i>-Death comes to all, but for the fallen it shall come with a vengance.</i></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Unbeknownst to Eizck, Usula was doing nothing so much as marking the leaders of the Tier Dal.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be impossible for her to approach their queen, but the marking of the prominent leaders of the various guilds was much less complicated as they were not so well protected.  The Tier Dal were more arrogant than the Iksar, and Usula counted that a weakness.  After all, the Tier Dal would never expect two Iksar to come to their lands, and especially not to come to the very heart of their abode.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;Wait here&quot;</span style='color: green;'> Usula said to the legionnaire <span style='color: green;'>&quot;and continue to read.  Do not respond to anything or anyone until I return.  Oh&quot;</span style='color: green;'> she continued as if an afterthought <span style='color: green;'>&quot;Be prepared to run.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>Usula cloaked herself in shadow and entered into the complex housing the Necromancers and Shadow Knights of the Tier Dal.  Inside the building, she noted the power of the guild leaders.  It seemed, by the traffic within the complex, that the Tier Dal had many who followed the dark paths.  Many more than the Iksar, at any rate.  Still, she was extremely aware of the limitations of magic.  Hidden as she was, she exited the complex and entered into the great library of Neriak.  There, she took several interesting books from the walls and placed them into her sack.  She had what she came for.  Unfortunately for the Tier Dal who happened to be in the library the same time she was there, they found only the comforting arms of Innoruuk waiting for them after their death.<br><br>Eizck gave a small start when Usula suddenly placed her hand on his shoulder from behind.  He did not flinch, much to his credit.  <span style='color: green;'>&quot;Time for us to return to Cabilis, Eizck.  I think we have found what we needed.  Still, we would not want the Tier Dal to be too comfortable in their city, now would we?  We must be off.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>Eizck did not respond.  Then he heard the shouting.  If nothing else, the Tier Dal were quick, and guards were rushing to the Library.  Eizck, remembering some of his battles in the Overthere, did not think he would like to stick around much longer.<br><br>They made it to the entrance before they were discovered.  Apparently, Usula did not care for sulking.  She cast aside her robes, hissed loudly, and <b><span style='color: red;'>destroyed</b></span style='color: red;'> the guard at the left side of the entrance.  The guard at the right responded quickly.<br><br>Fortunately for Usula, Eizck responded just as quickly and engaged the guard.  Usula cackled as she began a dark enchantment, summoning an undead servant to her cause.  The dark boned assassin backstabbed the hapless Dragoon, and Eizck finished him off.  Nevertheless, the battle caused several other Tier Dal to rush out.  Usula sent her pet at them, but as it was specifically crafted for assassination, it did not stand long against the combined might of the now stirred up Tier Dal.  <br><br>Usula, laughing the entire time, called for Eizck to follow her as she set off at a run, heading south.  Sounds of pursuit were clearly evident, but Usula continued to laugh.  Eizck ran quietly and with determination, rather surprised that Usula had the endurance to run such a distance without tiring.  Then again, he thought, she does not have much by way of armor, either.<br><br>After a while, they reached a structure that was becoming rather familiar to Eizck, and he was not surprised to see the Lunarsa sorceress standing at the pinnacle of the structure.<br><br>Still, there was someone standing between the two Iksar and the High Elf.  It was a Tier Dal, and well equipped at that.  Eizck immediately engaged the elf.  The battle was furious, as the elf was quite skilled with the sharp edged weapon he carried.  Eizck thrust, but the elf countered.  The elf lunged, and Eizck riposted.  The battle went on for only thirty seconds or so, but to Eizck it seemed hours.  Finally, he was able to lunge and deliver a deathblow to the elf.  Then it was that the noticed he was injured, and rather severely at that.  Knowing that pursuit was close behind, he joined Usula and the Lunarsa upon the platform.<br><br><br>Both he and Usula were standing in the Dreadlands, near the ruins of the old Combine Empire a moment later.  The Lunarsa was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>Sighing, Usula cast a spell, and in doing so, groaned a bit.  Eizck saw his wounds disappear at a rapid rate, much more rapid than his natural regeneration would normally allow.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;Why must I waste my time casting such a spell upon you Eizck?&quot;</span style='color: green;'> Usula asked hauntingly.  He had no reply.  Usula then reached into her sack and pulled out a ring.  Handing it to Eizck, she said <span style='color: green;'>&quot;Here, perhaps this shall make you a bit less likely to be so easily injured.  I will not abide injured servants.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>Eizck looked at the ring.  It was a black pearl velium ring, and imbued with a magical essence.  Eizck had not seen it's like before, and was amazed.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Usula Wurmbane<br>Iksar Necromancer<br>Empress of Fear</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The Dreadlands. A place Eiczk hated. Covered in ice, crawling with Vermin, it was not his most favorite of places. He was still glad to be back from his journey. The twinge along his side was subsiding as he healed, but the fury inside was not abating. The woman was crazy. He so much wanted to ask Usula if she liked stirring up wasps nests as a child. He also wondered if she remembered the stings. He had taken her across the continent of Antonica for what... <b><span style='color: red;'>BOOKS!</span style='color: red;'></b> Then she commented on her having to heal him constantly. &quot;I wonder how she would do against a Tier'Dal Blademaster.&quot; he thought . He had only fought a few of the softskins, but that one was no apprentice, nor was he a common guard. That Eiczk had only received a gash across his flank was by the will of Cazic. Granted he had enjoyed the fight. However he was so busy worrying about anyone attacking Usula, that he failed to realize the enjoyment. At least she had enjoyed it, he could still hear her laughing.<br><br>The Iksar looked at the ring she had just given him. It was a beautiful Black pearl, set within velium. He had seen such rings before, they were supposed to aid in your speed. This one looked slightly different. At first he had wanted to throw the ring at her and tell her what she could do with it. Instead he pocketed it. &quot;I will make sure to use this as needed,... my lady.&quot; This last he added with a questioning tone, as if to question the worth of her title. He bowed stiffly, and coldly stalked down the Spire. How she could get under his scales so easily now was a puzzle that made Eiczk's head hurt. Since he had all but declared for her, he was tied to her surely as stink on a troll.<br><br>He drew his sword and started towards the tunnel that lead out into the frozen wastes. Usula followed. As they walked he thought through things. <br><br>&quot;She takes us to the den of foul sofskins for books. Why? I don't recognize those books. She also was gone much too long to have just gotten those and come back. What else had she done? We also go quietly along allowing no one to see us. Then we break out of the city killing guards and Thule knows what else she killed in Iksar style, as if to paint a sign. She wants everyone to know who was in Neriak, and that we possess those books. Those books hold import, and I hope they were worth the risk.&quot; Eiczk sighed. He was not one for puzzling out the machinations of a necromancer. He understood combat, not politics.<br><br>Usula seemed to glare at him, such that he could feel it with his back turned. It would be a long journey home.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Feb 17 23:25:47 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Eiczk Draygoner<br>34th rank Warrior<br>Legionnaire of Cabilis<br>Xegony<br><i>-Death comes to all, but for the fallen it shall come with a vengance.</i></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The small gnome sat quietly behind a rock watching the two iksars converse before the robed one cast a spell and faded from view.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not daring to speak to cast the spell which would make the Necromancer visible to him.  He waited quietly wondering why he had taken all the precautions of following these Iksar all the way from the desert, almost always cloaked with the invisiblity that his art granted him.  <br><br>He knew only two things: These Iksar were obviously important, and they MUST have had something to do with the death of his uncle.<br><br>A tear came to his eye as the thoughts of his Uncle Attalon came to mind.  He quickly pulled himself together, realizing much time had passed as he thought to himself. He heard a soft sound to his left and turning quickly, he saw nothing.  He sat confused for a moment before he realized that something was there, only cloaked with magic. He crouched lower behind his rock, knowing that he was no match for these two Iksar yet, and wondering again why he followed them. The noise's source became apparent as the robed Iksar appeared behind the armored one and said it was time to go. The Iksar left the city with a large comotion, the little gnome slipping past as teh Robed Iksar destroyed a Dark Elf by sheer force of will. The gnome was suddenly very glad he hadn't attempted any reckless attacks.  The Iksar took off in a run, the Tier'Dal momentarily distracted by a skeletal pet the Iksar had conjured. The gnome ran as fast as he could after the Iksar, again wondering why he was following the Lizards. He could not keep up with them as his legs were much shorter than theirs. He began to perspire as he ran on, his eyes closed wishing again and again he hadn't left the safety of Ak'Kanon(sp?). He suddenly tripped over something and landed face down in dirt.  He cursed quietly as he looked to see what is was that he had tripped over.  A black tome marked with a skull on the cover lay on the ground.  <br><br>&quot;That damn Iksar must have dropped this.&quot;<br><br>He was about to toss the book as he happened to glace at the binding of the book.  Tier'dal runes covered the binding.  <br><br>&quot;Huh? She must have stolen this... hmmmm...&quot;<br><br>He heard footsteps behind him as he stood up, and began to panic before he realized his Invisiblity was still working. He looked around then cast the Gate spell which would bring his to the relative safety of the Oasis in Ro.  A flash of mana and the Gnome and book disappeared.<br><br> Azuthe (Name Pending)<br> Gnome Necromancer <br> 23rd Circle of the Dark Arts<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A cold breeze blew through the Nektulos Forest. The trees swayed in the breeze, as if dancing to an unknown piper's tune. Eiczk wondered who the piper was, and if he was also dancing to that same tune. He sat on the edge of a small camp, munching on his favorite snack... Vein worms. Sleeping not far away was Usula, Council Member of New Sebilis. They had been traveling for some time through the wilds of Antonica. Since Freeport and the surrounding areas were under constant watch, he had led Usula through the Rathe Mountains, and up through Lake Rathetear. It had been an arduous journey, of which he was not sure why they were making it. It took them a week to finally arrive at their destination. High Hold Pass was not the best of locations for Iksar to sneak through unnoticed. In fact one guard had seen them, but did not live long enough to give alarm. He also increased the few meager rations Eiczk had brought by a factor of 10.<br><br>The two had come from Kunark upon one of the new Naval ships that were built. They moved fast, and were not rickety like that old barge that used to run from Timorous Deep to the Overthere. When they were underway Usula had informed him this was a recon mission into Tier'Dal Territory. &quot;Those lands are dangerous, even for one of your great power.&quot; He had warned. However she did not listen. Her plans were to penetrate the Third Gate of Neriak for some purpose. The Third Gate was about as far into Neriak as one could get. It also was home to the Necromancer, Cleric and ShadowKnight guilds. The oddest part was why it was they who had to come. A Member of the new council and a Legionnaire of Cabilis; to what end did this serve? Soldiers and Troopers usually did recon missions. If it evolved dealing with Magic, the Brood or The Scaled Mystics were involved. So why did they have to come? He cared not that it was risky, but the logic of it escaped him. <i><b>Any incursions into hostile territory with high-ranking officers or members of the court are to be escorted by a minimum of 30 warriors and 10 Shaman or Necromancers.</b></i> This was the rule set forth concerning officials. Granted this would have to be changed as it was made during the times of the Empress, but it still stood as a rule of the Legion. &quot;So what is so important that others cannot be trusted with this task.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I don't think I really want to know&quot;, Eiczk thought.<br><br>Now they sat encamped not too far from the outer gates of Neriak. He was on guard, as was Usula's Minion that had come with her. The young warrior lifted his head, smelling the air. It feels so much like being inside a spell, He thought. The air did seem to have an energy to it, none of which felt good. The other eerie part was the sounds of the forest, or lack there of. Breezes blew occasionally bringing cold drafts along with it. They also stirred the trees. He could hear them creak as they swayed. However, that was all he could hear. No birds, no sounds of any other animal that moved. Eiczk really did not like this place. *SNAP!* It was the only warning the warrior received that someone was within a few paces of their camp. Wasting no movement, Eiczk brought up his bow, and loosed an arrow. It flew true, right into the eye socket of a Dark-Elf. The elf spun around from the force of the impact, then collapsed to the ground in a bloody lump. Not moving, the Iksar listened for any other sounds nearby. Silence answered him coldly. The soon-to-be-food was dressed in a very dingy robe, which looked as if it had been stored folded for some time. &quot;An initiate of some kind, nothing more than a child!&quot; he thought out loud. <br><br>&quot;Yes, a child. One of their new Necromancers.&quot; Echoed a voice behind him.<br><br>&quot;You are awake, my lady. It appears Cazic has seen fit to send us more rations. Though I would rather he sends more Vein Worms.&quot; The lizard grinned devilishly. Shouts came from the northeast, screams and the sound of metal on metal. &quot;Combat!&quot; Eiczk cried. His hand went to his sword loosing it for battle. <br><br>&quot;No my friend, we go not to battle now. It is time for us to be silent. We must journey to the city now. I have been waiting for this.&quot;<br><br>Usula stood and began casting some dark magic. The now decedent body was engulfed in some strange noxious fire. After the flames cleared only a spot of char remained. They stole away, creeping towards the Gates of Neriak. It did not take long to get there. A long tunnel carved into the side of the mountain marked the entrance to the Tier'Dal fortress. Normally it would be Flanked by guards, and supported by others scouting nearby. There were no guards. &quot;Odd.&quot;, mumbled the warrior.<br><br>&quot;This is where we part company, I did not ask you to come in with me, as it gets dangerous from here.&quot; <br><br>Eiczk looked at her, and responded in kind. &quot;Over my dead body! I am not letting you go in there without some protection. No matter how great your power is, their numbers alone say you will die if you go alone. I will follow you if it means going into the heart of Freeport Naked! You cannot die, as Royalty... err I mean as Council members are more important than any member of the Legion. We may die that you shall lead us.&quot; He still was getting used to the fact that Usula was no longer the Empress.<br><br>&quot;Very well, here then.&quot; Usula pulled 2 large cloaks out from the pack her pet was carrying, and tossed one to him. &quot;This will make travel easier through the gates. And crouch down some, remember we are larger than these softskins, we will be questioned if we do not appear as Tier'Dal.&quot; <br><br>Eiczk nodded to this put on the cloak and ducked down to what he believed to be the height of a sofskin elf. The cloaks covered every inch of their scales, and the hoods were deep enough to hide their facial features in shadow. They strode into the city, Usula just behind the Warrior. <br><br>It did not take long before they were passing the dark-skins. Legionnaire Draygoner found it hard not to out sword and carve a way to safer ground. As they passed amazingly most just nodded to them. They were not questioned. It did not take long to reach the third gate, though many times they had to step aside to prevent from being run over by guards. They all seemed to be running towards the gates. Pity he could not understand what half of them were saying. Only a few used Dark Speech. Usula led them to a large building that looked like the jaws of a great beast. she pulled him aside, and sat down, handing him a book. <br><br>&quot;Look like you are studying it.&quot; Usula whispered.<br><br>Eiczk complied. keeping the hood of his cloak down, he began reading over the book. With the long sleeves covering his hands, it was difficult, but he did manage. It was comprised of symbols and words the Iksar had never seen before. As he studied the book, he kept looking around trying to see if anyone noticed them. The softskins around him just walked by hardly giving them a glance. The common occurrence of cloaked figures studying in the dark worked as an excellent guise. <br><br>&quot;What now, my lady?&quot; the warrior inquired.<br><br>Usula smiled a knowing smile, and replied:<br>&quot;Now we wait for the fun to begin.&quot;<br><br>Eiczk felt that this was going to be a long, bad day.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Feb 17 17:30:52 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Eiczk Draygoner<br>34th rank Warrior<br>Legionnaire of Cabilis<br>Xegony<br><i>-Death comes to all, but for the fallen it shall come with a vengance.</i></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Pusbag looked up from his mumblings and rantings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Icewind Novastorm stood before him.  Behind Icewind was the usual collection of Dwarven guards, weapons sprouting off of their hearty frames in all directions.<br><br>Pusbag gave Icewind a great toothy smile,&quot;So old friend, have you come to gloat?  While you enjoy yourself, perhaps you could give me some food?&quot;.<br><br>Icewind said nothing, then began to cast a spell.  Pusbag was no intiate, he was well schooled in all manners of spell casting.  Yet, these were Koada'dal words he had never heard spoken before.  He stared at the High Elf and growled.  His eyes became heavy, and he fell asleep, completely oblivious to what was happening.<br><br><br>___________________________________<br><br><br><br>The former Troll King awoke.  The sun glared down from above.  Wherever I am, thought Pusbag, it is high noon.  He sat up, and noticed suddenly that he was in full armor.  A great iron mace lay on the ground before him.  He stood and picked it up.  It weighed at least fifty stones.  It wasn't his beloved sceptre, but, it would do.  It had powerful magics in it, he would have to discover what they were.<br><br>Pusbag turned and looked to the horizon.  He recognized this place.  He was in the Dreadlands of Kunark.  How he came here he would very much like to know.  A tall Iksar stepped from the underbrush to his left.<br><br>&quot;Ahh, you are awake Troll, good!  It is time for us to begin our journey.&quot;  The Iksar picked up a bag from the ground and began to walk away.  In his right hand was a long gnarled staff.  Pusbag had no intention of doing anything the Iksar said, yet, he was completely within the creature's will.  Briefly, he fought with every ounce of his will, then succumbed to the desire of the lizard man.  Pusbag knew from that moment on he would have to protect and follow the Iksar where ever this adventure led.  He could not fight the geas, the great quest placed upon him.<br><br>&quot;Where are we going friend?  I am famished.&quot;, Pusbag blurted out as he set after the Iksar.  <br><br>The Iksar stopped and turned around,&quot;Here, I will make us invisible, then you won't be so hungry.  When night comes we will hunt up a feast.&quot;  The Iksar cast a some spells, rendering both of the travelers invisible.  Pusbag was curious, he hadn't known the Iksar to cast such invisibility spells. <br><br>&quot;Who are you? Where are we going?,&quot; he asked again as they set out.<br><br>Without looking back, the Iksar said,&quot;You know of me Troll, for now you may call me Gezz.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>With the Three under his command, and in his new, but still scarred state, Culris began his diversion for the Tier'Dal.<br>Although he saw his queen as greedy, and liable to fall as the Shissar and the first Sebilisian empire had, he none the less carried out what he was asked. He knew that certain things could be done to save those who mattered, but first to matters at hand.<br>He proceeded from his hidden chambers to the Haggle Baron's. There, hidden away in a room of his own construction was something that would destroy the already shakey alliance with the Koada and Fier'Dal. What he had was caught in the Dreadlands, killing iksar knights and mystics, cutting them down one by one, till Culris came, and defeated it in a glorious battle, that only he and the... thing... were the survivors of. What he had was a Koada'Dal Evoker, a dangerous female indeed, and only with a power protection around the room was Culris able to enstill her. However, she was sudued, and imprisoned for many seasons now, but if knowledge of her came out to the Lunsara or the Icewind, the alliance would be broken.<br>As he entered the room, the Koada'Dal acknowledged him, one artist of magic to another. Addressing her in that of a Elf, though rather shakily, he relayed the story of why he had been absent of late, and developments over Norrath, though she was a prisoner, Culris was not an unreasonable jailer, and kept her informed of events, well-fed and provided items for experiments, but he knew not to be so lax, for she still pined for the Faydark.<br>Then he came to the matter of the Tier'Dal, and noticed that the elf became agiated when their name was spoken. This would aid him much he thought.<br><br>&quot;How would you like to help iksar?&quot;<br>&quot;I will not aid you, you treat me well, but i am still imprisoned&quot;<br>&quot;very well, but help against... black?...elves?&quot;<br>&quot;If i can help destroy them, then i will, the fallen must be saved, and only death can realse them&quot;<br>&quot;Then help me...&quot;<br><br>With this Culris produced a vial, and the Visceral Dagger, used only in incantations of upmost importance<br><br>&quot;Give wrist white elf&quot; Culris commanded<br>As the wrist was produced, he quickly sliced it open, and captured the blue blood of the Koada'Dal into the vial, until it spilled over. Thn he corked the vial back up, and secreated it about his person and went to the door. The elf was writhing on the floor, apparently losing blood was hurtful, and she could not regenrate skin and flesh where the wound had been. Such was the weakness of all those who were not the children of Cazic-Thule.<br>With a quick movement of his clawed hands, he exchanged wounds with the Koada'Dal, the open wrists closing on her, and opening on him. He quickly concentatred and the regeration effect of the iksar closed the wounds, leaving a faint scar, and a few drops of green blood on the floor.<br><br>Culris then left the elf to her amusements, and he prepared the spell to distract the Tier'Dal while the mission was performed<br>&nbsp;<br>Culris Wurmbane<br>Lord of the Brood<br>Mithaniel Marr</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>With Culris fully restored to her, Usula began working on their plans for the nasty softskins known as the Tier Dal.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had heard of their great library and the many secret necromantic spells offered only in Neriak.  She also knew that if anything, Neriak was more unassailable than Kaladim had been.  While Culris consolidated Iksar supremacy over Kunark, Usula brought along Eizck (now her personal assistant) and headed to the Warsliks Woods.  Eizck, ever bold and curious, tried to pry information from Usula, but she was not forthcoming.<br><br>When they approached the docks, Eizck realized they must be either inspecting the new sea-going ships, or they were themselves going on a trip.  He somehow suspected the latter, as Usula seemed to be carrying a small pack with her.  She did not tell him to pack anything though, which was a bit of a surprise.  Then again, knowing her as he was beginning to, he wondered if she would just as soon live off the land.<br><br>Therefore, Eizck was not at all surprised when they both boarded one of the new ships, which already had a full crew of monk-sailors, and set out north.<br><br>Once the boat had departed, Usula was a little more forthcoming.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;We have need of a small reconnaissance mission into the heart of the Tier Dal territory.  As you are so familiar with softskin lands, and as I have such ability, we shall steal into Neriak and see whats about.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>&quot;Those lands are dangerous,&quot; Eizck warned &quot;even for one of your great power.&quot;<br><br>Usula smirked.  <span style='color: green;'>&quot;I have no great fear of the little softskins, and neither shall you.  We do nothing to let them know we are there, and they do nothing to see us.  They would not expect us to come into the heart of their power, especially since we made it so obvious our concerns were over Kunark.  I expect that Culris will be arranging matters so that the Tier Dal have other matters to worry about besides the guarding of the Third Gate.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>Eizck blinked.  It was a sure sign he thought Usula bereft of her senses.  Surely not even the great dragons would dare enter the deepest and darkest portion of Neriak.  Seeing this, however, Usula explained.<br><br><span style='color: green;'>&quot;Trust me Eizck, I have no desire to become a martyr.  We have to much important work to accomplish.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>Eizck shrugged, knowing that regardless of the outcome, he was bound to this powerful necromancer to whatever fate held.<br><br><br>After having dodged a few Elven vessels, the ship finally paused off the shore of the desert of North Ro.  Usula and Eizck dove in and swam to shore, whereupon, Usula quickly summoned a skeletal servant to carry her small bag.  Eizck, in the meantime, began to polish his weapons and clean his armor in an attempt to assure the salty water did not cause them damage.<br><br>Usula turned to Eizck and said, <span style='color: green;'>&quot;Now it is your turn to take me to the black forest and then on to the entrance of Neriak.  I do not expect you to enter in with me, as that would take great courage.&quot;</span style='color: green;'><br><br>Eizck led the way, and as he had anticipated, they lived off the small meals they were able to forage from the land.  Before the week was out, they were in the dark forests hiding the entrance of Neriak.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sat Feb 16 17:00:08 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Usula Wurmbane<br>Iksar Necromancer<br>Empress of Fear</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As &quot;Olunea&quot; rested on the wharf in the glowing sunshine she contemplated just what her next move should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;There had been no word of where Pusbag was or whether he was even alive, which was surprising due to the enormous portent of such information.  <i>If</i> he was alive the security of his confinement was very tight particularly since rumor was the coin of the realm in Norrath.  Such knowledge was valuable beyond belief in the right hands and ears, yet with no iota of scuttlebutt on anyone's tongue it was becoming increasingly likely Pusbag was truly dead after all.<br><br>Samisen had noted for weeks the passage of a dwarf who was a messenger between the office of Ironholm and the various arms of the bureaucracy running the city of New Freeport.  She took particular notice of how Ironholm's lackey would pass by a dark alley on his way to communicate with the many faceless drones intent on counting their beans.  <br><br>One of the thieves in her employ waited for the clueless dwarf to make his way from the Bureau of Foreign Affairs (where diplomatic dispatches originated once they arrived from Kaladim) to Ironhom's office, which took him past the thief's isolated ambush site.  Upon hearing the approaching footsteps of the message-laden dwarf, the rogue slipped out of the shadows and slid a poisoned blade between the ribs of the dwarf.  Immediately the body slumped silently in death into the arms of the rogue where he was carried into a dark room and divested of the bag of money, messenges, and financial statements he carried.  The bag was passed to a darkened figure dressed in identity hiding flowing robes who, upon receiving the pouch, disappeared from sight.  The dwarf's body was disposed of, near a tavern where he was known to frequent and engage in drinking contests.  A death of another dwarf in yet another drunken brawl would not be of interest to anyone, even if he was Ironhom's messenger.  What would be cause for alarm, however, would be the loss of the diplomatic pouch.  However, no clue would be left to its' location.<br><br>********************************************************<br><br>Sometime later Samisen met with Braag in a secret location and showed him a very important document.  It stated that Pusbag was indeed alive in Kaladim after being tortured at the hands of the Iksar and delivered to the dwarves as a peace offering from Usula.  He was to be held as a political prisoner until a decision could be made about his fate.  The page was signed by King Thex himself with his royal seal.  There were other items of interest such as the disposition of forces, numbers of supplies, total of wealth, some of which Samisen knew from her surveillence of New Freeport and her close association with Quick, the leading human councilmember.<br><br>After cursing that lizard-witch, the two Pusbag loyalists began to formulate a plan to rescue their King...<br><br>--Pusbag Infection<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Pusbag had been released from his bonds, but had been permanently detained in a room deep in the heart of Kaladim.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some form of long lasting magic had been cast on him and the fizzles which had become increasingly frequent had become a permanent fixture here in the dwarve's home city.  He could not cast a single successful &quot;Gate&quot; or even a lowly &quot;Summon Food&quot;.<br><br>With little food his stomach growled incessantly these past weeks and the little food that was given him was hardly palatable to his gourmet tastes.   No word had reached him of the fate of Grobb, Braag, or any of a thousand other concerns the former Troll King had, and so to hold boredom at arm's length he practiced the intricate kata his adopted human sister, Angiisan the monk, had taught him as a youngster.  He had always found it soothed him when he worried about various details of leadership.  If nothing else, it kept him in fighting shape if the opportunity to rip the heads off of some of his captors presented itself since he had no weapons.  <br><br>He wondered where his royal scepter was.  Who was wearing his incredible enchanted armor?  What faction was running Grobb?  Where was Usula, Braag, and Samisen?  Well, no use in speculating about things over which he had no control. <br><br>Pusbag continued to stew in his room and wait for others to decide his fate.<br><br>*************************************************************<br><br>Meanwhile Braag met with Samisen deep in the desert of Ro.  They shared information, ideas, and goods all the while keeping an eye on their surroundings.   They had no desire to be ambushed by a wandering Sand Giant, especially since they had become quite numerous since the fall of Freeport.  The presence of the huge monsters ensured that the meeting was kept secret.<br><br>Eventually the two nodded their heads and went their separate ways, Braag to the south and Samisen to the north.  Each had their ears open for any news of their leader, Pusbag Infection and longed to have him leading them in battle against their foes once again.  No word had leaked of his whereabouts as of yet, but they knew that such a secret could not be kept for long...<br><br>--Pusbag Infection<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Feb 15 16:53:39 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc on <br>Hopefully this helps set the stage for an invasion of Tier'Dal territory by the Iksar... at least a bunch of the guards are occupied now.<br>/ooc off<br><br>Bing, an old Druid friend of Phreda's father, was the first to notice the tromping sound coming from his right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Snickering, he poked the halfling next to him to get his attention.  &quot;I hear somebody coming, get ready to have some fun!&quot;  He tucked his half-eaten fishcake into a coat pocket to free his fingers for wiggling.  &quot;Do you have something to wash this down with?&quot;<br><br>His friend did not have time to reply.  A cry from the first human guard sent the other forty nine on a collision course with the halfling troop.  Cocky from their recent troll victory, they were caught completely off guard; the halflings all screamed incoherently and scattered!<br><br>Phreda, part of the front half of the caravan with the rest of the warriors, first heard the battle cry of a human guard, then a dozen screams of halfling terror behind her.  She turned around to witness chaos - halflings fleeing in every direction like a gnome's fireworks explosion.  Suddenly dozens of human guards were upon them.  Two warriors on either side of her were immediately slain with long, heavy swords.  Realizing the odds of the halflings surviving this skirmish were slim to none, Phreda followed her nose and ran, pausing only to run her claws through a guard attempting to intercept her.<br><br>She ran to the top of a very steep hill and steeled herself to meet the guard who chased her.  She got quite a headstart owing to natural halfling agility, not to mention the massive adrenaline rush from a deadly confrontation.  The guard gave a roar and swung his large sword straight at her jugular.  She ducked the sword and countered by slashing his midsection with her Icetooth claws.  Before he could swing a second time, she split the muscles of his left thigh.  The human lost his balance and tumbled down the rocks, head over heels, to the bottom of the hill.<br><br>Spent, Phreda sat hard onto the ground and surveyed the scene beyond.  Thankfully not many halflings laid motionless on the ground.  However, it appeared as if the humans were enjoying themselves too much.  Many laughed as they chased and terrorized the little folk, toying with them like naughty children trying to herd piglets.  <br><br>Phreda rubbed her eyes and sighed.  Their party was at least temporarily dissolved, they looked like fools, and more importantly, they lost some of their own.  She didn't know where she was in the forest; she had a compass, but was unaware of the location of sentry posts and other bad areas.  <br><br>Suddenly she felt a blade lift the hairs on the back of her neck.  Phreda froze.  A voice with a strange dialect said quietly, &quot;Look what we have here.... A brazen lass who brings evil to our home.  You don't belong here.  Answer for yourself!&quot;  Phreda slowly turned around and was shocked to see three strange halflings in tattered leather dress, all pointing daggers at her.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Feb 15 04:26:51 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Phreda Biggles<br>20 Warrior, Bristlebane<br>Have bandages, will travel</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Munc just had huffed and puffed his way back into the halfling territory when he heard the tromping of horses' hooves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsheathing his sword he slipped between the trees and saw humans (food!) driving the small people around in sport before dispatching some to the hereafter.  He quickly got behind some of the riders and swung his sword making a clean cut in the human's neck, causing it roll down the horse's back like a bowling ball.  Another went down due to the surprise attack and keen edge of Munc's blade.  Several more died to the deadly whirling metal, until the humans shouted out &quot;Retreat!  Retreat!&quot;  Turning around, Munc saw some movement in the bushes where a green leather-clad hobbit had a knife to the throat of one of the female halflings who several days earlier had pecked open wounds in his stout legs.  Reaching back, he drove the sharp point of the sword deep into the back of the green halfling, skewering him like a shishkabob.  The knife wielding halfling writhed briefly before giving up the ghost.  Munc quickly spoke to the wide-eyed lady halfling warrior standing in front of him, &quot;Me no hurt little snackies!  Me only want to talk to yoo!&quot;  Just as quickly, Munc threw his weapon down on the ground and opened his hands proving he was unarmed.  &quot;Munc need to see little snackies 'bout sumptin.  Me promise to not eat yoo!  No stream prej-dice pleeeeese!&quot;<br><br>As the humans and rouge halflings rode or ran off to escape the attack from the Troll, the original halfling war party surrounded Munc nervously fingering their blades or magical staves.  The richly dressed hobbit stepped forward and addressed Munc, &quot;Well?  What have you to say, foul creature?  It must be very important for you to have come back all that way just to die at our hands.  Speak!&quot;<br><br>With that invitation, Munc began to explain what had happened in Grobb and the treachery of the Iksar against his Emperor, Pusbag.  He was interupted several times by the halfling leader for clearer details causing Munc to start from the very beginning each time.  Very soon the halflings realized it was best to let the Troll finish his story, since he was dumber than a sack of hammers.  At his present rate it would be well into the evening before he finished his tale.  <br><br>Eventually Munc stopped speaking.  The silence was palpable since it was not yet clear why the Troll had come back to the Rivervale area.  &quot;Well?  Why did you come back here, Munc?&quot; asked Phreda, who was more feeling more kindly towards the Troll due to his intervention on her behalf.<br><br>&quot;Me want to be halfling now.  Me no more want to be Troll.  Trolls got bad king.  King Totem no good!  Me no more want to be Troll.  Me can lift good, help yoo fix snackie city, kill bad tings.  Me no eat yoo, me promise,&quot; answered Munc.<br><br>The halflings got in a big circle and began whispering, every once in a while poking a head up to give the Troll a frowning look.  Munc stood wringing his hands as he did when nervous, and dancing from foot to foot like he had to go to the bathroom.  Finally the leader walked up to the Troll.  &quot;Ok.  You must promise to serve us faithfully and never eat another hobbit.  That, and you have to revoke your evil ways and become a vegan-- that means you eat only plants.&quot;<br><br>Munc's face showed horror.<br><br>&quot;Oh, alright.  You may eat animals, but only those ones we tell you are acceptable to eat.  Rats and such.  You promise?&quot; asked the hobbit.<br><br>&quot;Yuh!  Yuh!  Munc promise!  Me make good snackie!&quot;<br><br>And with that the halflings got a major upgrade in their defense.  Munc stood guard, hauled trees, stone, lifted wooden beams, and cleared Rivervale of the brush which clogged the streets of the once-beautiful city.  He quickly slew the goblins which encroached on the western wall of Rivervale and secured the halfling's borders, much to the delight of the deputies assigned to guarding the hobbit complement.  Munc had never felt more at home.  More importantly, he felt he had made a friend with Phreda, something he never had before.  Soon, he tagged along behind her like a love-struck puppy whenever he finished whatever tasks assigned to him by the overseers.  Phreda was initially annoyed by the attention of the giant creature and the catcalls of her fellow warriors, but soon saw a different aspect to the friendly Troll's personality.  In his rapt devotion to the little halfling, he displayed a kindness rarely seen by even the most compassionate of her kind.  The two were soon fast friends and would seldom be seen not in the other's company. <br><br>--Pusbag Infection<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Feb 15 16:28:50 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Late one morning Phreda and Munc were fishing in the river flowing through Rivervale.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, Phreda was using a fishing pole and bait, and Munc was leaning his head close to the water, and yelling at any trout which happened to swim close by.  His troll visage combined with the sudden noise usually killed the fish outright.  He would then pluck the floating fish from the water and swallow it whole.  <br><br>Munc held to his promise of eating only smaller prey found in the area, but his stomach was in perpetual mid-grumble.  &quot;I miss da Grobb,&quot; Munc said, &quot;but da Grobb is a bad place.&quot;  Phreda put her pole away and sat down next to him.  They looked at each other and frowned.  &quot;Will Phreda snackie help Munc fix Grobb?&quot;  Munc asked plaintively.  <br><br>Phreda chewed on her lip thoughtfully.  Rivervale was restored more or less to its former state, and a messenger was already en route to invite the rest of its citizens home.  The town was dreadfully quiet, and Phanny wasn't there to provide her with common sense. &quot;You mean like an undercover operation?&quot;  she asked.  Munc furrowed his bristly brows.  &quot;We would have to be sneaky,&quot; she explained.  &quot;We can't just walk up and kill the bad guys.&quot;  Munc was clearly disappointed.  &quot;But we can kill bad guys in da Grobb if we're sneaky!&quot;<br><br>A few hours later, they set off toward the Troll Swamps. Munc was well laden with fishcakes and beer, and Phreda sat on his shoulders.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>When the Lunarsa reappeared in Usula's chambers, Icewind was with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed quite stiffly to the necromancer, but made no comment.  Usula looked pensive for the first time in her very long career, and she bowed low to the cleric of Tunare.<br><br>&quot;I would ask a boon of you Novastorm and offer something valuable in return.  In the chambers behind me lay the corpse of Culris Wurmbane, a necromancer you have known in your past.  He is very important to me, and I ask you raise him from death.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why should I help you, dark <b>witch</b>?&quot; Icewind asked her a bit spitefully.<br><br>&quot;Because I have never invaded your lands.  While the Faydark sat ripe for the picking, I stayed my soldiers hands, and your forests were spared.  This however, it not what I wish to say.  Forgive me, it is not often when I ask a favor, and I have grown unused to anything other than immediate obedience.  I have no quarrel with you softskin elves, Icewind, and I can see to it that the Iksar never invade your forests.  I also offer whatever wealth or possessions I have.  Culris <i>must</i> live again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Release my aunt from whatever beguilement you have placed upon her, and I shall consider your offer.&quot; Icewind retorted.<br><br>Aaean laughed.  &quot;I am under no beguilement nephew.  Usula and I have had an understanding since before you were conceived.  I saved her from goblins when she was just a hatchling, and she promised never to invade the Faydark in recompense.  She has always kept her pledges, always.  You may think it distasteful for me to associate with necromancers, but you forget that I am a wizardess, and not a follower of the All Mother.  Many is the time I have hunted with such as her, and always I do things of my own choosing, whether you wish to understand them or not.&quot;<br><br>Icewind glared at his aunt, wishing her words were false, even as his soul knew they were true.  &quot;Fine, swear never to set claws in the Faydark, Usula.  Promise no Iksar will come to the Faydark with the intent to harm my people, and I will resurrect Culris for you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thus I promise, Icewind.  You have my word as a member of the Wurmbane Brood.&quot; Usula responded quickly.<br><br>Icewind glared at her once more, then turned to his aunt.  &quot;Bring me back to the Faydark after this, aunt, and then forever banish yourself from my sight.&quot;<br><br>Aaean chuckled.<br><br>Icewind proceeded to the back halls Usula claimed as her private quarters and saw the corpse carefully cushioned on the floor.  Then he saw the head, or lack thereof, and gasped.  &quot;This will take a mighty blessing from Tunare to restore, Usula.  I pray you honor your bargain, or nothing shall save you from the wrath of the righteous.&quot;<br><br>Usula nodded, watching intently as the cleric began scribing mystic symbols into the air and chanting in the sing-song way of the elves.  An hour passed, then finally many strands of blue manna surrounded Culris, and before Usula could blink, he was standing, severely weakened and looking extremely tired, before her.<br><br>Without thought she rushed to Culris and gave him a hug.  He blanched, but then was surrounded by more strands of glowing blue magic.  He was healed.<br><br>Without a word to the necromancers, Icewind turned to is aunt and said, &quot;Take me from this house of death immediately.&quot;  Aaean complied and gated with Icewind to the Greater Faydark.<br><br>&quot;Culris, my lord, you are returned to me.  Now we must strike against the Tier Dal before they gain control of Antonica.  They were the only faction that did not participate in the debacle known as Pusbags Great Offensive.  Oh, before I forget, here are some new clothes I had crafted especially for you from the skin of the troll barbarian.  I have deemed the legionnaire we had been discussing as a true asset to our cause.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Eizck stood in the midst of Warsliks Woods, working sword-forms. They helped him relax, and focus himself. He may not be a monk, but Glox had taught him a thing or two to control his anger when he was younger. The blade circled him as if moving of a will of its own. Arcing through tight circles, then shifting as if to parry an invisible blow. It helped him forget pain. His thoughts fled back to what happened in Grobb.<br><br><i>The troll moved very quickly for one of its girth. His axe came sweeping at Eiczk's head, but the iksar warrior dodged, spun around and decapitated the troll. &quot;So much for another of these foolish guards.&quot; he said. Another troll advanced, sword in hand. at the same time he saw Pusbag leap at Culris. Eiczk moved to stop him, but pain struck him like a boulder. He could not move. The troll swordsman had pinned him against a rock like a goblin on a spit. Fear fled into him with a vengance. Culris' death would mean great pain for the one who had brought him here, instead of mounting his head on the walls of Cabilis. He snarled at the foul green blob grinning at him, his eyes sinking from green to a fiery red. He spun his offhand sword, striking upwards. The beast's arm fell to the ground. With the trollish sword sticking out of his shoulder, Eiczk leaped towards where he saw pusbag. Fear filled him, he would not fail Usula. Using momentum to swing his damaged arm, he brought the butt handle of his main blade down on Pusbag's skull. It made a very satisfying &quot;Crunch&quot;. Pusbag would be left to Usula to handle, as it would take more than a weak knock on the head to kill a troll. Smiling he turned to see the crushed body of Culris, all joy fled. He pulled the sword free of his own body, and turned to face the armless swordsman who had delayed his attack on Pusbag. &quot;You will pay for this, food!&quot; said the warrior. Eiczk plunged the troll's blade through his skull, and the corpse dropped like a sack of bad veinworms. He had failed to protect the Clutchmate of a council member. He looked at Usula seeing sadness in her eyes, and shared in her pain. He had liked Culris, for what little time he knew him.</I><br><br>Fear controls us, gives us strength. Draw on it and you will never fail. Eiczk heard the words of his father calling from the distant past. He ran his fingers across an old scar on his ribs. That had been given to him by trolls long ago when he first set foot on Antonica. He had gone to Grobb to seek food and supplies. They greeted him as if he were one of the Softskins. He remembered the darkness of Grobb all too well. Escape had been only thanks to a young troll who had never seen an iksar before. The troll had healed him a little, but could not heal many of the wounds inflicted. Especially the wound upon his ribs. One of the Troll shaman had sliced his ribs open, tormenting nerves. Neither shaman nor necromancer had been able to heal that scar. He hated the Green foul beasts. They stunk, and tasted nasty. However their meat made excellent field rations. The Legionnaire focused back on the present realzing that someone had been saying his name. To him it had been a distant wind blowing through the trees. &quot;Umm.. Legionnaire? are you alright?&quot; said one of the nearby troopers. &quot;I'm fine. I was just deep in thought. what is it Trooper?&quot; The trooper advanced slowly and spoke again &quot;Well sir, I come from the western post. we... um... well you see... One of the giant prisoners has run amok, and killed several of the guards.&quot; Eiczk sighed. &quot;And you were where Trooper? I instructed you to stand on hand to stay any &quot;rebelious thoughts&quot; the few remaining prisoners would have. They are useful in our naval construction.&quot; &quot;Well sir,&quot; continued the trooper. &quot;I was following what I thought was a goblin that escaped. You know, the tunnels to the lake and all still being checked.&quot; Eiczk raised an eyeridge at the thought. &quot;Yes Trooper I know. How unfortunate.&quot; <br><br>Eiczk stepped towards the trooper, and brought his sword up in a sweeping motion, ending with the blade pointing to the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trooper fell to the ground, split from groin to skull. &quot;Mount this rubbish on the walls of the western outpost. You there, soldier!&quot; He pointed to one of the soldiers, whom he had fought with in grobb. &quot;You are to proceed with 15 more soldiers to reinforce that post. Make sure that the slaves work as they need to. I will handle that rouge Giant. Do not disobey me. Others will watch for goblins, though I doubt we will see many free anytime soon. move it, Trooper!&quot; The soldier smiled at being raised in rank. Eiczk knew this one would not fail him. &quot;Also, if by some chance you do see it to follow shadows as your predecessor did, know this. I will not kill anymore men. However those whom are too weak to serve will be turned over to the Brood for punishment. I gave the trooper Mercy for his weakness, the Brood will not. NOW GO!&quot; <br><br>He barked the last of this as the trooper and 15 soldiers peeled off towards the western fort. One drug the garbage that was the ex-commander of the outer fort. Eiczk managed a grin, the body would keep fear working the soldiers as much as the threat of being turned over to Necromancers. He really did not want to loose anymore soldiers. Every last member of the Legion, from the warlords down to the Partisans knew what had happened to Pusbag. They did not want to face that punishment. The fallen are the best example, he remembered his father saying. Eiczk turned towards the building where he had set up camp for the time being, only to see Footman Moglok standing there. &quot;Yes footman, what is it?&quot; he snapped. &quot;Well, sir I come with a summons from the lady Usula, she has need of you.&quot; the Legionnaire sighed, Fear gave him strength. Perhaps today was the day he died for his failure.&quot;Very well footman, Oh since you failed Warlord Vyzer in returning the Gubnubb brothers' heads, I have a task for you. Go out to the outer fort, near the entrance to the Overthere. There is a Rouge Giant loose. Bring me his head, or I will assume he has yours. I will make a decent trooper of you yet Moglok.&quot; The footman ran off into the woods as Eiczk ran towards Cabilis. Fear drove him to obey, and gave him strength.<br><br>/OOC ON<br>Sorry I have not posted recently, other familial duties took a higher priority.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Pusbag Infection, deposed King/Emperor of the Trolls and All Norrath, carefully observed all the goings on of the tasty creatures intent on hurting him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprising to anyone but himself, the only <i>real</i> discomfort was his stomach which remained perpetually half empty.  Yes, the tortures and pain inflicted on him were uncomfortable, even excruciating at times, but what that traitorous whelp, Usula did not seem to understand was he <i>enjoyed</i> the sharp sensations of hurt coursing through his nerve endings.  While the immediate pain was undesirable, the surge of adrenaline it produced afterwards was liberating and intoxicating.  He laughed to himself.  This showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that gecko which posed as a Empress had no idea what made Trolls-- and especially him -- tick.  He had been inflicting pain on himself since he was old enough to do so simply for the sheer joy of it.<br><br>Granted, the flaying of his flesh was trememdously painful, but Pusbag had reached new levels of ecstasy at the same time.  He only wished these vermin holding him would feed him a decent meal, because the only thing which truly bothered him was the constant gnawing of his stomach which remained forever empty.  Having all these Happy Meals walking just out of his reach was the <i>real</i> torture.  <br><br>Usula.   Hmmmmm.  She betrayed him both in word and deed.  How would he turn this to his advantage?  He had lost literally everything from his kingdom to his clothes, yet he had been here before.  He started out as a poor Troll with nothing, so this was nothing new.  But that did not mean he intended on staying here depending on the good will of these <i>cattle</i> to survive.  He needed a plan.<br><br>He noted that the Iksar and now the dwarves had bound and gagged him to prevent him using his tremendous magical powers by voice or finger waving.  That option for now was blocked.  He had recovered from the injuries gained by the tender loving ministrations of that Iksar/salamander's torturing due to his inate regenerative abilities, so he had much of his legendary strength back, but now was not a time to test the power of those who held him captive.  Indeed, if he could get some mild pain inflicted on himself he could easily double his strength with the rush he got with raw nerves.<br><br>He elected to play it safe for now and pretend to be groggy and helpless, just as he had back in Kunark.  <i>Whew!</i>  Yet that axe had just about ended everything when he arrived in Kaladim.  <i>That</i> was a close call.<br><br>He took stock of where things were at the moment.  Grobb was, as far as he knew, in the hands of Usula.  Beyond that he really knew nothing.  Were the rest of his loyal comrades still alive?  Had all his coffer and treasuries been emptied?  Most likely, he thought ruefully, at that last question.  The remaining issue then was how would this play out?  No telling since he was at the mercy of these cursed cattle at the hands of his new arch-enemy.  Given the chance he would return the favor and make a nice bathrobe from that Skink's skin.  Usula would pay if Innoruuk gave him the chance.  His hate began to burn in his chest fueling his will to live.  <br><br>Only time would tell how this would play out and he wasn't dead yet...<br><br>--Pusbag Infection<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Feb 12 12:16:18 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

Blue arcing magic seemingly burst out of the air before them, followed by a large slumped over Troll.  The Troll, a dazed look on his face fell straight forward, and collapsed in the dirt in front of Kaladim.  Guard Dunn ran forward with his battle axe raised high, ready to deliver the killing blow to ancient, hated, enemy of the Dwarves.  <br><br>&quot;Wait! Dunn stop!&quot;, Guard Dunil screamed after his friend.  Dunn's blow veered at the last moment and the axe buried itself deep into the dirt near the Troll's head.  A crowd of Dwarven citizens and visiting Elves and Gnomes began to gather. <br><br>Guard Dunil walked up to the motionless Troll and poked him with his foot.  A low moan escaped from the Troll, and the crowd stepped back several steps.  This obviously was not a normal Troll.  Even for a male, he was a least a foot taller than the average Troll.  Even though his skin appeared to be unmarked, one who knew Trolls would be able to discern that this Troll had been horribly tortured.<br><br>Guard Dunil turned to his partner,&quot;Dunn, summon the guard and fetch Canloe Nusback.  Strange omens find this Troll at our doorstep.  The King will want to question him.  Hurry now!&quot;<br><br>Guard Dunn ran into Kaladim, and soon a dozen members of the Stormguard poured out.  A few minutes later, Canloe Nusback arrived.  The Stormguard had rolled the Troll over onto his back.  He looked much like a dead green cow, his girth adding a new hill to the Butcherblock Mountains.  Canloe stopped a few feet from the troll, his jaw dropping in astonishment.  Quickly he came out of his lull and began snapping orders.<br><br>The Troll was bound thrice over with the strongest ropes.  Canloe instructed the Stormguard to gag him tightly also.  Then he had the guards at the entrance quadrupled.  He spied a Fier'Dal ranger in the crowd, one of Faydark's Champions, and pulled him aside.  As Canloe whispered instructions in the young ranger's ear, the Elf's eyes grew wide until it seemed they would pop out of his head.  When Canloe finished the Elf sprinted away and dissapeared into the hills, as was their way, in the direction of Greater Faydark.<br><br>The Troll was carried into Kaladim and bound to a post in the arena.  His gags were tightened once again.  Barrtih the Brave, the greatest living Dwarven warrior stepped forward, pushing through the guards surrounding the Troll.  The Troll's eyes opened, he moaned, tried to move, but failed, then scanned his surroundings.  A mixture of apprehension and malice crossed his face.  He made another futile attempt to stuggle against his bonds, gave up, and settled his eyes on Barrith.<br><br>Reaching into a pouch at his belt, Barrith began to fill a pipe.  A broad smile stretched across his face.  &quot;Pusbag Infection, King of the Trolls, prisoner of Kaladim.&quot;, Barrith plainly stated and began to laugh.  &quot;Who would have thought?  The King will be most interested in this.  What has happened to your kingdom, Troll?  How far you have fallen?&quot;  Barrith laughed again and stared back at Pusbag, the fallen Troll Emperor.  He puffed on his pipe, chuckling at the misfortune that brought the great Pusbag to this.<br><br>__________________________<br><br><br>A council was convened.  Stormguard thoughout the Butcherblock were tripled.  Pusbag was kept, bound a gagged, in the arena.  Barrith and a horde of Stormguard stood watch over him.  High priests of Brell were on hand in case the Troll somehow attempted any magics.  The next day, the King of the Elves and Gnomes would arrive, and along with the King of the Dwarves, the interrogation of Pusbag Infection would begin.<br><br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Dwarven Paladin<br>Tallon Zek Server<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>
