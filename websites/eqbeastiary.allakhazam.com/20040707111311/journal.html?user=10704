I could feel the power, a drawing in of coldest air, transformed by my inherent power into a minor ice cloud that could be settled on a target, flow into and then from my fingers. <br><br>I would get the intial stages of casting accomplished and Guardian Aron or one of the other Guards would have already taken care of the bandit. I never really saw a complete cast of the spell. In all honesty, I was terrified. I was sure I was not going to survive the encounter, but it was over in a matter of moments. I was in one piece, and exhilerated, even if I was really only a bystander.<br><br>The guardians went on their way and Aron thanked me for my support, adding "You need to head into the forest at hand here and practice, not only your magical talents but also how to determine which targets to choose, how to handle a weapon, even how to run if need be. You need to start forming your own hunting and killing style, determine when to cast and when to hit, and when to protect yourself. Your mind must be a sponge now, if you are ever to aide in the defense of this land, let alone fight in incursions into the pagan lands. Off with you! The night is at hand, and you must hunt your dinner, find a place to rest and think of all that has happened this day."<br><br>I ran from the river, back to near the towering wall of the Association. Light was coming from the ramparts and from a nearby gathering of stones. I could not see the source of the light near the circle of stones and so I went to investigate, perhaps it was someone else's magical abilities? I reached the stones and saw that the glow was coming from a carving of a dragon on largest of the stones. There was writing on another stone. I had the ability to read apparently. It mentioned the ability to bind myself here and return by releasing my will, whatever that meant. <br><br>The thought struck me that I was becoming insensitive to the wonders and mystery of the day. I was taking what skills and knowledges I had for granted. I was no longer asking myself from whence they had come. It was as if I had settled into an acceptance of the challenges awaiting me, some inner core was hardening with resolve. I wanted the answers, to who and how and why. Where and when were resolved, but the rest would have to wait. I would have to make my way patiently... accepting whatever gifts, whatever companionship, whatever knowledge was granted me by the Ghods or a God. I did not have a clear grasp of that. <br><br>I was feeling chill. The night was falling faster. I caused my magical torch to be lit and felt hunger for the first time. I needed to hunt something that the merchant would buy from me, something to make a few more copper so that I might buy the simple cloak that the merchant had for sale. I headed to an area where I could see others who looked to be in similar circumstances. They were hunting a variety of small creatures and placing items from the kills in the rather roomy backpacks they carried. The thought of the backpack caused me to acquire one. Truly, a magical time and land. <br><br>I noticed a dappled lynx cub nearby and knew I had my first real target. I shielded myself, made sure my stick was ready in my hand and let fly the ice cloud spell. That caught its attention. I let the spell go again, and again, a complete rush of power flinging with each cast! It was injured, but still it came, determined to put one of us out of it's misery. It reached me and I beat it back unmercifully with the stick. I was more animal then it was at this point. At last, it was finished. I took what was edible and what was sellable, thanked my luck and headed back to the Association. <br><br>I sold the skin, bought a plain grey woolen cloak to wrap around myself and then found a common area where a large pot was holding what looked to be a stew of some kind. I asked about joining and was told to take my meat to the spit, draw some ale for myself and partake of the fellowship. The smell was enough to make me ravenous. The people were quiet but friendly. Some said hello, others just nodded. I found a bowl, a spot, some bread and sitting on my new cloak, ate and watched and listened and prepared to go back out into the forest for some night kills. The very good ale however, went to my head. I laid down in my spot, my head on the overturned bowl, spread my cloak around me, and fell into a much needed rest.</p>&nbsp;<br>Nolarita Aurelius, <br>of DAoC, EQ, UO, and finest of all..Legends of Kesmai </td></tr>

My hands were icy, but I was ready. The river took a few minutes to get to. I then followed it until I found the road. There were resplendently dressed guardians on the road, and all around them there were people hunting what looked to be rather small creatures of various types. <br><br>I was fascinated for several minutes by spells being fired in all directions. So beautiful to look at, and then I recalled my abilities, rather sheepishly, and tried my hand at casting a protective shield over myself, just in case a wandering animal decided it liked my scent. I concentrated for a moment, said a quick prayer to God, gazed at some distant point, and cast the spell. Suddenly I felt a rush of power from my feet, a coalessing of forces from the ground and from my inner core. I threw my arms up and out and from my finger tips came a very large bubble of pulsing maroon light that completely surrounded me. The light quickly faded, but I was left with a sensation of covering, a bit like a very fine gauze all over my body. I was delighted! It worked! It was easy, only a few seconds of concentration and power were required, and instinctively I knew I had a much deeper resevoir to pull from. <br><br>I soon caught site of Aron, quite a handsome figure in all his armour. In the interest of study, I tried to cast the shield spell on him, but, alas, it was for self protection only. Thank God it did not misfire or cause him to become angry or injured! In my excitement, I had not been thinking clearly and just fired blindly. He seemed to be laughing about something when I at last introduced myself and handed him the note. I was sure it was my ignorance. He thanked me for the service, with some coppers, but I was too overwelmed by the site of several nere' do wells running up with guards chasing them to pay any attention to the coinage. They looked to be coming straight at us! <br><br>Gaurdian Aron shouted something at them and turned to me and said "Have at them Nolarita! You have a spell of injury, USE it!" I concentrated on several of the attackers quickly and flung out the other spell I seemed to know.....</p>&nbsp;<br>Nolarita Aurelius, <br>of DAoC, EQ, UO, and finest of all..Legends of Kesmai </td></tr>

He wants me to take a note to the Gaurdian Aron who can be found near the Riverbank on the only road in the area. With something akin to gratitude, I take the note and thank him. It helps me to have a task, to focus on something other then my anxiety and ignorance. <br><br>I spent a few minutes walking around the Lethantis Association to make sure I knew where I could find the Mistress again and also to note who else may be there for guidance. I was pleasantly surprised to find a clothing merchant very near, as I knew that I would soon need more protection from the elements and any creatures I might hunt. There were also armed guards, a rather comforting site.<br><br>I spoke to the merchant about prices and how to come by some quick copper to purchase from him, but he was not very informative and really quite busy. I noted the presence of many types of people, and some of the gear they had on, to try to get a feel for what I should acquire. I gave my self time to try and remember the basics of life and movement, much came back quickly to me. My confidence was growing. It was time to journey out from this safe place.....</p>&nbsp;<br>Nolarita Aurelius, <br>of DAoC, EQ, UO, and finest of all..Legends of Kesmai </td></tr>

Not knowing what else to do, I speak to her. She seems to know that I am confused. She bids me welcome and tells me of the the dark times at hand and the need for defenders of this place. I now know I am in Albion and that Camelot is the name of the main keep. I know something of this, but, only bits and pieces make their way through the cloud that surrounds my mind. A king named Arthur, a Queen ~ Guinevere and something about a table. AH, that brings a sting of pain to my head. A table....a Round Table and Knights, but it is gone again. <br><br>The Mistress tells me other things as I stand there. She tells me of my magical abilities, what spells to use and why a sturdy tree branch has appeared in my hand. She tells me of guilds and arts and pathways. She tells me I have a magical torch to light my footsteps and how to call it to me when needed. I am bewildered by it all and simply stand there and take in what she has to say. People continue to come and go around me, no one noticing me or my dress or my astonishment. The people, in fact, seem very like myself, unsure and overwelmed. <br><br>The day is passing into twilight when Mistress Trethia takes pity on me and says that I may ask her questions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you know of me Mistress? How did I come to be here? Why am I in pain? Who is it that I am longing for? Am I dead?" I asked as quickly and as quietly as I could.<br>   She gazed at me deeply with something akin to sorrow on her face, but her voice was light when she said "I know that you are from another time and place, and that many others have come here like you. You are confused now, but time will tell you all you need to know about from where and whence you came. I am not permitted to tell you. All that I can tell you is that you must now make your way in this world. <br><br>It is your choice how you are to go about that, but I know that based on your race, Avalonian, you are inherently good at magic. I know what spells you have now and what will be available to you, based on which path you choose. I can tell you of whom to seek and when to seek them, but that is all. <br><br>As for being dead...do you feel dead? Does this resemble your idea of an afterlife? Do people struggle, hunt, kill, steal, anger, and covet in the next world? Because, I can assure you, they do those things here. You must be on your guard, you must study and grow, you must live to fight another day. You will be needed in the Battles ahead."<br><br>With that she told me that it was time for me to speak to Clorustos, the man standing next to her and then to be on my way, to hunt, to study, to meet new people and find new places. " A blessing upon you Nolarita of the Avalonians ~ may the Ghods keep you and protect and guide you and may you solve the great mystery in which you now find yourself. Come to me again when you have had some time to work on the things we have discussed." She turned to someone else then. I turned to Clorustos with my heart pounding and my knees weak and introduced myself......<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Nolarita Aurelius, <br>of DAoC, EQ, UO, and finest of all..Legends of Kesmai </td></tr>

I am awakened, but I feel fear and cannot open my eyes. I am not sure where or who or what I am. My mind is in turmoil. I cannot focus. Faces swirl by in the darkness, I feel pain in my heart, great pain and longing. I plead with the unknown. Please! help me...Time passes, a voice in my head, that is not mine, says that I am Nolarita, an Avalonian and that I must open my eyes and begin my life anew, but I am so alone, and there is one who calls to me from the darkness....and then he is gone, but the pain lingers around my heart like a cold fist clenching it...My own voice says not to be a coward, to get on with it and so I open my eyes. I see grey stone, massive walls. People run past me on all sides. I seem to know that I am in something called the Lethantis Association and that I must talk to the woman who is standing in front of me....I know that I have been before, but I know not where or how or when. I am aware that the clothing I am wearing is barely sufficient to keep out the damp let alone protect me from I know not what. I am feeling much anxiety, but also, a sense of wonder is coming upon me....I somehow recall being older, wiser, not this young, frightened woman who is still mostly girl. I decide to talk to the woman and take the first steps to recover from whatever has caused me to forget everything, somehow change from whomever I was and come to this place of mystery.........and so it begins anew.</p>&nbsp;<br>Nolarita Aurelius, <br>of DAoC, EQ, UO, and finest of all..Legends of Kesmai </td></tr>

I did get into Beta 4 and tested the rogue in Midgard. Pretty interesting. Based on the descriptions I have read at all the sites, ALL the characters are going to be worthwhile for one thing or another. Basically, the best advice is to make your first character something you really WANT to play.

This has now been fixed, so the character named "Bandersnatchy SnatcherDeBandy" will now appear correctly, I'm sure to his great relief. <br><br><br><br>- The checkbox to not show help tips will now work - i.e. if you check it, no tips will be shown when you level between levels 1 through 5. <br><br>- Combat Styles now have different colored "trails" depending on which type of weapon they are used with. <br><br>- The [Tab] key that removes the interface now removes spell effect icons as well. <br><br>- The "you jump to location xxxx" debug message that printed when you zoned into cities and dungeons has been removed. <br><br>- You can now use shift-left and right arrow to move the curser inside the chat input box to edit text. <br><br>- You can shift-up and shift-down arrow to go back and forth between your last 10 commands (sends, etc.). <br><br>- You will no longer see the Tips help box pop up after level 6. <br><br>- When you move while interacting with an NPC, and the NPC interaction window goes away, you can now interact again with that same NPC and you'll see the text that you had seen before. <br><br>- We are now experimenting with "sticky" combat. Use the /stick command to stick to your currently selected enemy, and you will follow him quite closely, while you can continue to fight him. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS FOR TEST PURPOSES ONLY AT THIS POINT. We may remove it once we test the dynamics of the proposed feature. <br><br>- You now get the health bar for doors correctly. <br><br>- Doors should now be better synchronized (i.e. you won't see them open when others see them closed, etc.). <br><br>- All combat styles have changed. Please see the list in this release note for the new styles you character has been given. <br><br>- There were some problems with Left Axe combat styles. These have been fixed in this round of combat style fixes, so now Left Axe styles should do more damage than before. <br><br>- Several spells effects have been fixed and upgraded. <br><br><br><br>WORLD NOTES <br><br>- Midgard should now have the full complement of dye stores scattered throughout the towns in the Home region. <br><br>- The denizens of the Cursed Forest have now made themselves known. Like Raumarik of Midgard, the Cursed Forest is not an area to go if you are looking for quick experience or easy camps. It is an extremely high level zone with only a handful of monsters that do not respawn quickly. Additionally, some of the monsters may require more than one group of higher level players to defeat. <br><br><br><br><br>CRAFTING SYSTEM NOTES <br>- Component pieces of Leatherworking, Metalworking, and Woodworking for Weaponcrafting have had their timers cut by 50%, which means you can make weapons in 2/3 the time you could before. <br><br><br><br>COMBAT STYLES <br><br>We have significantly upgraded and buffed out each Realm's combat styles. These are similar to, but not at all the same as what you are used to. This will require some getting used to, so please get to testing them, and let us know what you find. <br><br>Albion and Midgard styles have their proper names; Hibernian Styles have been redone but do not yet have final names. <br><br><br>Albion Weapon Styles <br><br>Slashing: <br><br>2 -

Of course, our servers will be open and ready to go on that date even though the majority of the players will not have the game in their hands until a few days later. We thank the community for the patience that it has shown regarding our reluctance to announce this date until we were confident that the game would be shipped as planned. <br><br>Let me take this opportunity to also talk about a couple of subjects that the community has asked about for many months. The first subject is what type of different servers will be available at launch. Mythic is committed to setting a new standard for meeting the varied needs of our community. Ever since this project began we have been discussing and making plans for the widest array of servers ever seen in this industry. We have heard the community&#8217;s concerns and over the next six months Mythic will be launching many different types of servers. At launch, our first server type will be one geared to those members of the community who have asked for a &#8220;Role-playing&#8221; server. While DAoC is already skewed toward role-playing with its three competing and non-cooperative realms, this server named Percival, will only be the first of many new community-enhancing features of DAoC. Due to the nature of this very competitive industry, we will not make any announcements about the next server type, other than it is tentatively scheduled to debut in early November, until the server is ready to go into beta testing. <br><br>The other thing that I would like to spend a little time talking about is what is up next for Mythic after the release of DAoC. Mythic is committed to making DAoC the premier MMORPG in the industry. To this end Mythic will not have a &#8220;Live&#8221; team dedicated to the product after the game is released. Rather we will keep the entire company working on the game to keep the content, improvements and, of course, the repairs flowing smoothly until we have met and exceeded that goal. What you see at release from DAoC is just the beginning of the product&#8217;s evolution, not the end. In coming weeks I will update the community as to what major features and enhancements will be added to game over the coming months. Suffice it to say that we have heard what the community has asked for and we will not disappoint them. <br><br>Once again, I thank the community for its support during the development of DAoC and I look forward to seeing you in our shared world. <br><br>Mark <br><br>Version 1.16 26 September 2001 <br><br>============================== <br><br><br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>======================== <br><br>- When you buy an item that you cannot equip, you will now get a dialog asking you if you really want to buy it. <br><br>- Region music has been fleshed out a little more -- you now get region music in more places, and more tracks play. <br><br>- There are two buttons on the keyboard config screen - one for "RPG defaults" and one for "FPS defaults". FPS defaults are the original set for the game. RPG defaults are from other popular online RPGs. <br><br>- You should no longer "walk in place" on death (for a few moments) any more. <br><br>- You should now see spell animations and effects all the time. There was a bug where they weren't displaying at all under heavy network load. <br><br>- You will now climb ramps and steps much more smoothly, without needing to jump. <br><br>- Rangers now receive the correct skills and spells alluded to in yesterday's patch notes. <br><br>- Thief poison can now be purchased in stacks of 10, and can be stackable to 20. <br><br>- You can move faster while hidden now, which is dependant on your stealth specialization. <br><br>- Backstab and Backstab II Critical Strike combat styles will now stun. <br><br>- Critical Strike combat styles have had their damage raised across the board. <br><br>- You can no longer do critical shots on every shot by using the "auto release" feature. This was a bug. This is not a nerf. Please repeat - it was a bug. <br><br>- When taking over a keep, the keep's front door should now come back closed (it had been rebuilding itself in an open state, which was very silly). <br><br>- We are slowly raising the levels of all Realm Guards approaching the levels that we want them to be for release. Realm Guards were reduced in level for testing purposes, but will be slowly getting tougher as we approach the release date. <br><br>- Realm Guards will now agress on you regardless of level. <br><br>- We know about the many exploits that some of you are using in Realm Combat, and will be addressing them in the next few days. <br><br><br><br>TRADE SYSTEM NOTES <br><br>================== <br><br>- Need to note that the merchant cost of Siege Engine pieces was raised 50% (they were exactly the same as the cost to craft them, which made it so there was no reason to do so). <br><br><br><br>WORLD NOTES <br><br>=========== <br><br>- One New Dungeon: <br><br><br>Name: Varulvhamn <br><br>Realm: Midgard - Skona <br><br>Level: 31-36 in 3-4 person groups <br><br><br><br>Background: Varulvhamn is an underground lair wear some werewolves take up resident. Most of the werewolves that live here tend to be less militant than those in Skona, though not necessarily less aggressive towards humankind. Two types of werewolves live here, the "common" werewolves and the wolfaur. Wolfaurs and werewolves differ slightly. Wolfaurs tends to be older-generation werewolves and as such, are almost "natural" in their forms. Because of this, they are further removed from their ancestral savagery than normal, "younger-generation" werewolves. The majority of their society (with the exception of those who are in positions that require aggression, such as wolfaur headsmen) tends to be less aggressive than their werewolf counterparts. Much to the annoyance of the werewolves, the wolfaurs tend to be more philosophical, open-minded, and even willing to accept their human Nordic neighbors.While the wolfaur are not openly aggressive toward humans and their companions, they will defend their kindr <br><br>ed if needed. Local werewolf nobles also tend to gather in Varulvhamn to discuss matters of politics. <br><br><br><br>-Spawn rates in Nisse's Lair tweaked. <br><br>-Two Barkeeps added to Jordheim. All other associated barkeeps throughout the land are NOW functional. <br><br>-Levels of the guards in the frontier keeps have been modified upwards. <br><br>-All crabs in game are now set to type INSECT, and thus charmable. <br><br>-All frogs in the game are now set to type ANIMAL, and thus charmable. <br><br><br><br>SPELL SYSTEM NOTES <br><br>================== <br><br>Cleric changes: <br><br>- Heavenly Visions is now a PB AE Mesmerize on a timer. <br><br>- Increased recast timer on Drive Evil line. <br><br>- Increased cast time (slightly) on Stunning Flash line. <br><br><br><br>Sorcerer/Cabalist changes: <br><br>- Moved a generic snare line into the Body Destruction list. The spec list roots now come at higher level, and are area effect. <br><br><br><br>Mentalist changes: <br><br>- Mentalist's were bugged in their mana spec list... this list has been reverted back to its original form (which is to say, no one uses it) for the time being until a better revision can be implemented.<br><br>Version 1.15 25 September 2001 <br><br>============================== <br><br>This is a major update, with lots of spell system updates, enhancements, and changes. Read the "spell system notes" section closely. <br><br><br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br><br>======================== <br><br>- Skalds now have Charisma/Strength/Constitution as their primary/secondary/tertiary stats. <br><br>- Rangers now have a spell line to specialize in. See the Spell System Notes for full information. <br><br>- The exp curve has been slightly modified to make level 4 easier. Level 5 and 6 are a hairsbreadth harder to compensate. <br><br>- Personal sends now appear by default in all chat tabs. If you wish to change this, you can by configuring the chat interface. <br><br>- You can no longer follow yourself or your pets using the /follow command. <br><br>- You can no longer change your last name (once you have one), and you now must be 10th level before you can get a last name. <br><br>- You can disband a group member, even when he's far away. If he's out of range and cannot be selected, you must use "/disband " <br><br>- Resurrection spells that are designed to do so now correctly teleport dead players to the caster's feet. <br><br>- "/assist " now works - previously it only worked on the selected player. <br><br>- /bandage command has been removed. It was never fully implemented. <br><br>- Pets should now move around correctly in dungeons. <br><br>- Your character's race now shows on the character sheet window. <br><br>- Fixed spurious messages on zoning (you get experience, the dies, etc.) <br><br>- Rings and bracers will now correctly drop onto empty slots. <br><br>- You can now access the Spells Document at <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/docs/spells.html." target=_new>http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/docs/spells.html.</a> <br><br><br><br>SPELL SYSTEM NOTES <br>================== <br><br>- Disease durations were tuned down, the effect was made the same at all levels, and at higher levels disease spells are area-of-effect. <br><br>- All spells are now using their new names; check www.darkageofcamelot.com/docs/spells.html for the new lists. <br><br><br><br>Ranger changes: <br><br>- Rangers have had a new skill added, Pathfinding, which is the Ranger magic specialization track. See the latest spell list to see what spells are awarded and at what levels. <br><br><br><br>Cleric/Friar changes: <br><br>- Adjusted levels of Major Restoration line. The second resurrection spells should no longer be overwriting the L15 major heal. <br><br><br><br>Eldritch changes: <br><br>- Increased range on Shadowburst line. <br><br>- Increased radius of Null Storm line. <br><br>- Added Strength Dispersal line (Str/Con debuff). <br><br>- Paralyzing Wind line is now a mesmerize, with longer duration. <br><br>- Negate Sight line now debuffs Dex/Qui instead of just Dex. <br><br><br><br>Magician changes: <br><br>- Increased damage of Aura of Turning line. <br><br><br><br>Shaman changes: <br><br>- Added Fungal Rejuvenation line (Heal over time). <br><br><br><br>Naturalist changes: <br><br>- Slightly shortened healing cast times. <br><br><br><br>Healer changes: <br><br>- Added insta-stun and insta-mesmerize to high level Pacification spec. <br><br>- Increased range of several lines in Pacification line. <br><br><br><br>Spiritmaster changes: <br><br>- Added Gift of the Fallen line (self dmg shield). <br><br>- Added Spirit Flow line (transfer health to friends). <br><br>- Slightly lowered damage of life drain spells. <br><br>- Changed Gloomwave line to be point-blank-area-effect mesmerize instead of damage. <br><br><br><br>Runemaster changes: <br><br>- Fixed Blackbolt to debuff resistance instead of buffing it (whoops). <br><br>- Added Token of Movement line (backup group movement increase). <br><br>- Fleshed out Runic Ward line (Bladeturns - self, realm, group, group pulsing, etc.) <br><br><br><br>Warden changes: <br><br>- Shifted Attack Unending to the Regrowth spec track. <br><br>- Added Nature's Ward line to Nurture spec (Bladeturns - self, realm, group, group pulsing, etc.). <br><br>- Added Guardian's Encouragement line to Nurture spec. <br><br><br><br>Sorcerer changes: <br><br>- Added Amplify Movement line to Mind Twisting spec. <br><br><br><br>Cabalist changes: <br><br>- Added Puncture Spirit line (Area Effect DOT). <br><br>- Added Cursed Vigor line to Essence Manipulation (disease). <br><br>- Slightly reduced damage on spec lifedrains. <br><br><br><br>Minstrel changes: <br><br>- (Re)Added Cant of Confusion line. <br><br><br><br><br><br>WORLD NOTES <br><br>=========== <br><br>Two new Dungeons: <br><br><br><br>- Treibh Caillte -- Hibernian Dungeon: <br><br>For levels 27-36 (in groups), in Lough Gur. <br><br><br><br>Treibh Caillte is inhabited by a small tribe of creatures locally known as ursine dwellers. The clan lives inside their naturally formed cavern. The reclusive clan is hostile to outsiders. No one knows where they came from, only that they recently arrived and inhabited a cavern in Lough Gur they claimed as their own. None of the ursine dwellers have been seen outside Treibh Caillte, and since most locals stay away, not much is known about them. <br><br><br><br>- Muire Tomb -- Hibernian Dungeon: <br><br>For levels 8 - 15 (in groups) in Connacht <br><br><br><br>Concaire Muire and his family were rich landowners prone to greed and haughtiness. Bitter and rankled from years of cruel treatment, Muire serfs cast an evil eye upon the family. A dementia slowly started to afflict Concaire Muire until one night, he murdered his entire household and then himself. The family's tomb has since been a place of unrest. <br><br><br><br>Dungeon Tweaks: <br><br>-Nisse's Lair: <br><br>Lowered the agro radii of all the mobs and tweaked the spawn times across the board hoping to create more "safe spots." <br><br><br><br>Other Fixes: <br><br>- Rumor Mills (barkeepers) in Midgard should now give out quest information. Travel directions are coming soon. <br><br>- Gatekeepers should no longer be affected by various AOE spells. Please test this. <br><br><br>TRADE SKILL SYSTEM NOTES <br><br>======================== <br><br>- Several minor skill bugs fixed in Hibernian Armorcraft. <br><br>- Planing Tools were not being required as they should have been for many recipes involving wood, this should be fixed now. <br><br>- A bug that was causing many Tailoring recipes to display improperly and some siege piece recipes not to display at all should now be fixed. <br><br>- Siege pieces and the 0 copper arrows should no longer come up for consignments</p>&nbsp;<br>Nolarita Aurelius, <br>of DAoC, EQ, UO, and finest of all..Legends of Kesmai </td></tr>

Thanks for posting though. I will leave it open for a few more days, because of the well thought out post below. In response to the question, I have been awaiting a game that PVP was done well on, that was not straight up camping, yawn, that was not about things as much as alliances. I tried Everquest and UO, and didn't like either one of them. Believe me, I tried EQ for a couple of years and didn't like it. I wanted to, I really did. So, I am pumped for something new, that sounds incredibly well done. Here is a wish and a prayer that it lives up to it's hype :)</p>&nbsp;<br>Nolarita Aurelius, <br>of DAoC, EQ, UO, and finest of all..Legends of Kesmai </td></tr>

The people have been just as creative in their web designs for this game as for Everquest. A nice bit of hope that shows people are excited about it.<br><br>In my searches I have noticed many things that I like:<br><br>1) Crafting. The recepies are not secrets, a part that is desired to be produced has it's components listed on the screen and the player just needs to go fetch them. No more CTRL-clicking stacks of random parts to see if anyting happens. This is not true anymore for EQ since many sites have recepies, but for the player that doesn't have binders full of printed info next to the keyboard (no joke, I know many that do this) it is very convienent.<br><br>Also, failure does not always result in complete loss of components. For a completely new character that is starting out untwinked, this gets very expensive in EQ. My poor SK is doing fletching and tailoring, and soon will be getting spells, he will be always broke.<br><br>2) Quests. This ties in with crafting too. Some quests are not of a kill-loot-turn in type of system. After a period of time you can make a few swords, some guards need them in an outpost, when you turn them in a battle ensues that you help out in. Not sure if this is exactly correct, but you get the idea.<br><br>3) PvP done right. I do not like PvP in EQ. It feels personal and vindictive, more useless than in Quake. In Camelot the character names are removed and replaced with "Invader" or some such tag. And there is a PvP point system that will eventually enhance some skills at certain levels. Very nice touch.<br><br>There are also raids and seiges. A castle can be stormed and conquered to add to your realm, artifacts can be stolen from one realm and taken to another to enhance yours and debuff the others. There is a reason for raids and PvP, not just the adolesent joy of ruining a person's day because that person's post on a message board made you mad.<br><br>4) Twinking. None! WooHoo! If the armor you have is too good for your level, then it rots away. No more level 1 rangers running around in full ivy. Also the game tells you when your armor is too poor for you. It /cons a color just like creatures do and so at a certain point you need to get better.<br><br>There seems to be some drawbacks too, don't get me wrong.<br><br>1) The game feels small. About the size of Antonica for each realm. As fas as I can see, there is no comparison of size to size, but it just feels tiny. It seems easy for the developers to add in areas however. Recently new dungeons have been added. More are surely to come.<br><br>2) Spells. Spells seem limited to "Fireball 1", "Fireball 2", etc. No creative names exist yet. How about "Minor Meteor", then "Meteor", eventually working up to "Merlin's Meteor Shower". This may change with the public release, we can hope. Creative names aren't much, but they make for feelings of accomplishment when upgrading to new spells.<br><br>The choice seems very limited too. Not many "fun spells" like "Dance of the Firefly", "Gaze", or "Eye of Zomm". All battle spells all the time.<br><br>3) Stat enhances. There is an official message board out there, not sure of the address right now, will have to find it and post it. The developers state that stats like strength cannot be enhanced with gear. What you get at the beginning is all you have. Not a good move for those people coming from EQ where a pair of +STR rings is treasure to a warrior or INT/CHA combo for an enchanter. Many will be diassapointed and could be a major reason why some will come, play and go back to EQ.<br><br>Some parts are neither good nor bad, depending on who looks at them.<br><br>1) Combat maneuvers. There are many special attacks that certain classes can perform. Some can use a spear to do direct damage and bleeding, others can use their shield to knock the opponent silly (similar to the SK bash). Combinations of attacks and defensive stances enhance combat to a new level. But for these to work you need to hit 2 or 3 times in a row, without missing. Howm any triple hits do you get in EQ? I looked, not often enough. Even with dual weild and double attack.<br><br>2) Capes and other armor. People have been wanting cape animation for EQ for quite a while. I have not been for or against it. Make it like the Velious armors so it can be turned off for those with slower connections of systems. Camelot has flowing capes. Can a creature reach out and grab it as you run away so it can stop you? If so, many will scream about it as being an unfair advantage.<br><br>And almost any armor can be dyed colors. Nice for magic users that can make cloth look like leather so in PvP they aren't the primary targets. Until they start the arm waving and lightning bolts come lashing out of their fingers. Then they have a problem. heh<br><br>Holy Crap this has gotten long. More at a later time perhaps.<br><br>Tindarl Wolfhugger<br>Warriors of Living Force<br>Seventh Hammer Server</p>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
