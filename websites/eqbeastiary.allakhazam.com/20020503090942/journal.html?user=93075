	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, I'm taking advantage of today's patch-driven downtime to add another entry to my journal. This is a major patch that will change the way many of us play the game. What remains to be seen is whether this patch will be a St. Patty's Day Celebration or a victim of the Ides of March...<br><br>From my point of view, there aren't many things to dislike about this patch unless you're one of the Snobby EQ Veterans I griped about a couple of entries ago. While there is a small part of me that wants others to suffer through 34 levels of staring at a spellbook (especially since I *just* got to level 35 about a week ago), the more rational side of me knows that this was just a pain that nobody should suffer through.<br><br>I've read several well-communicated opinions on both sides of the experience debate, and while there may be an increase in high-level characters without all of the skills they need, I don't think it's going to be the massive problem some people are gnashing their teeth over.<br><br>Why? Well, there might be one or two times when someone without crowd control skills leads to the death of their party, but EQ's inherent Darwinism will take care of that. Players without appropriate skills will either learn those skills, or they will quickly develop a reputation and not get in any more groups.<br><br>There are two reasons I'm excited about these changes:<br><br>1. It will make it much easier for me to play another character. I have a limited amount of time to play - I can't spend 8 hours a day getting my toons up to the 50s... it's taken me nearly a year to get my primary up to 36. <br><br>The randomized skinner box model is still there, but making it less frustrating can only make things better, in my opinion, for both the players *and* Verant. I'll be happier because the game is slightly easier and I'm more able to enjoy other classes more readily, and Verant will profit because I'll be more likely to stay subscribed so I can get that mage or bard leveled up as well...<br><br>2. By removing some of the artificial game-lengthening aspects, Verant has actually (to my surprise) made the game more enjoyable for the majority of players instead of trying to push some strange philosophy/dogma or spurious rationale to make the game harder and longer (thus increasing the amount of time people are likely to subscribe).<br><br>For whatever reason (change in management, economic forces), Verant seems to be making fundamental changes in the game that nearly everyone wanted. I hope that this signals a new customer-satisfaction focus from Verant. They have a fantastic product that I love to play, I'm even more inclined to stay subscribed if they treat me nicely as well.<br><br>There are a few things that I disagree with in the changes - I think Clerics should still be the primary resurrection artists... there aren't many other reasons to suffer through the boredom that is a Cleric's life.<br><br>There was also one change that didn't make it in, that I thought should have been included. Since Luclin came out, the Wizard and Druid porting skills (and subsequent income potential) dropped. It's my opinion that the availability of various port spells should be changed. West Commons should now be one of the first port spells these classes receive, and Toxx forest one of the last. This way, there would still be an in-demand income-producing service that wizzies and dr00ds could provide during those levels when you really need money to equip yourself for the higher levels in the game.<br><br>Perhaps that will be looked at in a future patch. I hope so. I don't have a wizard or a druid, but I feel for those who do. At the same time, however, the ability to port quickly through Luclin made the game *incredibly* more enjoyable for me.<br><br>One final comment (and this one is definitely a biased one), I think that the cost for components for spells like Summon Corpse should be in line with the amount of money people are willing to pay for the service, especially for the level that a spell becomes available.<br><br>Lesser Summon Corpse is now available to low level necromancers and Summon Corpse is now available at Level 39. Yet according to the databases I've seen, the cost of a coffin is still very high. <br><br>If a coffin costs 100pp, a necromancer really needs to charge at least 130 to 150 to make a decent profit covering not only the high cost of the component, but to make up for the relative popularity of the service. Even in the high 30s and low to mid 40s, 150pp to summon a corpse is pretty steep, and most people will ask the necro to simply track the corpse instead (if they don't just go find it themselves).<br><br>I've never been offered (nor have I asked) for a donation for tracking a corpse... it's just not something that people attach a value to unless their corpse is about to rot along with all their gear. But that is rarely the case.<br><br>Everyone has needed to get to the commons quickly at some point, and I still see lots of shouts for ports. I've never *ever* seen a shout for someone to summon a corpse. If the component cost me 20pp and I could charge 25 or 30pp (in line with other time-saving services like ports), then I think many more people would find the service advantageous.<br><br>I don't know the details on the difference between Lesser Summon Corpse and Summon Corpse, nor do I know if there's an additional spell in the line, but the main point I'm trying to make is that when components are prohibitively expensive, nobody will ask for the service.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bene Moriore!<br>Ynar - Necromancer of the 8th Circle, Zebuxoruk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Necromancers. Great solo class, but pretty sucky in a group, right?<br><br>I don't think so.<br><br>I've found during my time in Norrath that Necromancers are frequently underestimated and misunderstood. I thought I'd take advantage of this downtime (there appears to have been a meltdown after today's patch) to outline some of the things that necromancers can do that you might not be aware of.<br><br>There are some obvious ones: tracking or summoning corpses, curing rabies and other diseases (we work with the undead a lot so we have to be able to cure all the lovely things they carry), and a full line of spells that affect the undead (damage, root, charm, etc.) But there are several necromancer abilities that almost always evoke a &quot;You can do THAT?&quot; from groups I'm in...<br><br>(Note that I'm only at level 33, so there are even more things available at higher levels, but if you're a high level, you've probably learned about necromancers already. =-)<br><br>Pets<br>====<br>The most obvious sign of the necromancer is the little skeleton buddy following him around. This might seem obvious, but many people forget that this pet is another pair of hands beating on a mob. Even better, a pet only takes 1% of the experience in a group no matter how much damage it does. You probably don't want a necro pet tanking regularly, but it's a great assistant damage dealer.<br><br>Think of a necro and his pet as a melee/caster combination. Higher level necro pets are actually different classes. Later necro pets can be necros (with lifetap) rogues (with backstab) or monks (with a flying kick). <br><br><br>Healer<br>======<br>At lower levels, a necromancer can make a pretty effective healer with the pact line of spells, especially as backup healer. Sure it might be kind of spooky to know that the necro is draining her own blood to give you HP, but do you really want to refuse the help? From level 30 until 44, this becomes less and less powerful, but it might be enough to keep you from dying from a DOT...<br><br><br>Snare<br>=====<br>The darkness line of spells give necromancers a great combo: snare and dot in one spell! As an example, the Level 29 Dooming Darkness spell not only slows movement by 60%, it also does up to 300 damage. That's just gravy if you're already needing to snare.<br><br><br>Root<br>====<br>We get it later than other classes, but once at level 34, a necro can root with the best of 'em.<br><br><br>Mez<br>===<br>That's right, I said mez. At level 24, we get a spell called Screaming Terror that mezzes a mob for 18 seconds. What's more, there's even a chance for an aggro memory wipe (but don't count on it). Unfortunately, a great deal of necro gear lowers charisma which can lead to resists, so don't ask a necro who's never tried mezzing to do it when you absolutely need it. A necro who's tried will know whether or not they have a dependable mez.<br><br>Remember also, that if the mez breaks early, that mob is going to be breathing down that necro's... er... neck. So be ready to taunt.<br><br><br>Feign Pulling/Splitting<br>=======================<br>Used infrequently, but still something to think about, necros can use Feign Death to pull a mob or root/feign split a spawn just like a monk. Unlike monks, however, a necro's FD is a spell (with a chance for a fizzle) so it's not as dependable as a monk.<br><br><br>The Mana Battery (&quot;Twitching the Healer&quot;)<br>=========================================<br>This is the big enchilada. At level 24, necros get a spell that will probably change their role in groups - especially in raid situations: the first in the Subversion line of spells. <br><br>I love using this spell in lower level zones on unsuspecting casters. I watch a caster fight and fight and fight, then come back to med, expecting a 5 minute wait while that mana bar slowly crawls up to full.<br><br>Then BAM! Full mana.<br><br>It does my black heart no end of good to hear &quot;WHAT WAS THAT???&quot;<br><br>The subversion line transfers mana from the necro to any targeted caster. When both are roughly equal in levels, it's about a two to one ratio (one bub of my mana will give you a half-bub). We become the clerics of mana and (not surprisingly) often end up mana-healing clerics. =-)<br><br>Here's the drill (it might sound complicated, but it really isn't). I convert my HP into mana. I give the mana to a needy caster. I then drain a mob of their HP to replenish mine. Wash, rinse, repeat.<br><br>It can sometimes be more efficient for the party healer to just heal the necro instead of counting on the necro to drain HP from a mob. My personal favorite is to get a regenerate from a shaman, then cast my mana drain spell. It's a poor man's clarity. Even better would be a real clarity, eliminating the need for HP conversion.<br><br>Pulling goes on much longer when the healer or nuker doesn't have to med as much.<br><br><br><br>So there you have it! A necromancer will never replace an enchanter for mezzing, or a monk for feigning, or a warrior for tanking, but they're a great class that can play several different roles in a group. (Plus, we're generally really nice people deep down. No, seriously. I mean it. Quit laughing.)<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Bene Moriore!<br>Ynar - Necromancer of the 8th Circle, Zebuxoruk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Note: I had just finished penning this latest diatribe when I read another interview on the Legends server... I'll leave my original post as is, but will append additional thoughts at the end.<br><br><br><br>So... Verant has now come out with Everquest Legends - a premium service at a very premium price. I won't bother to make the business school case for this product. I think it makes sense for Verant and a small portion of EQ players, and frankly, it looks like pretty cool.<br><br>In fact, it looks like what I thought Everquest was going to be when I first subscribed last summer.<br><br>First, the positives. <br><br>* Lots of events<br>* A truly dynamic world where what you do might actually have an impact<br>* Lower server populations<br>* (Presumably) fewer low-quality players (the kind that train you, or still can't effectively group despite having a level 40 toon, etc.)<br><br>That last one is a double-edged two-handed slash weapon, though. I've found that there are two types of EQ players that annoy me to no end. First, &quot;The n00b&quot; (as opposed to newbie) who doesn't care about the game, doesn't want to care about the game, and generally only cares about leveling, phat lewt, and going to Lake of Ill Manners to start arguments (&quot;What's the best class?&quot;).<br><br>Secondly, and perhaps controversially, is the Snobby EQ Veteran. This person is, in my mind, the same person as Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons. (&quot;Worst Zone Patch Ever.&quot;) They have 7 characters at level 60, 12 more in the 50s, and are so damn elitist that you just want to slap them. These are the same people who frequently get their knickers in a twist when you inspect &quot;without permission&quot; (THE HORROR!!!). I won't bring that debate up here except to say that 1. I don't care if you inspect me - Verant put that there because they couldn't accomplish the same thing in the graphics engine and 2. If you do care, just turn off the stupid message! It's very easy to do.<br><br>(Note that not all people who are offended by inspection are Snobby EQ Veterans, but nearly all Snobby EQ Veterans are offended by inspection.)<br><br>Unfortunately, it's my suspicion that there will be a higher-than-normal concentration of these so-called &quot;serious&quot; players on the Legends servers, and that's almost enough by itself to keep me on Zebuxoruk.<br><br>Almost, but not quite. I would gladly ignore the elite and sign up for legends were it not for its one overwhelming drawback:<br><br>It costs $40 a month!<br><br>Now, I'm just a simple Necromancer and not too good at math, but I believe that adds up to $480 a year! I thought $120 was steep! Don't get me wrong, EQ is still a pretty good bargain when it comes to cost/time. I play a lot of EQ and when you break it down on a per hour basis, I think I get my money's worth.<br><br>But I have yet to see a GM event that's worth an extra $30 per month. These events typically turn whatever zone they afflict into a madhouse of chaotic shouts, name calling, flames, and generally poor behavior. It's my feeling that this is because events have little focus, even less back-story, and almost no information provided ahead of time to allow people to get into the event and play the storyline out. Thus we are treated to:<br><br>&quot;Is the event starting&quot;<br>&quot;About to.&quot;<br>&quot;I JUST KILLED A HAIRY PHLEGMBALL!!!&quot;<br>&quot;WHAT'D IT DROP?????&quot;<br>&quot;DAMN NEAR KILLED ME!!!&quot;<br>&quot;Don't kill the Voracious Nosehair - it ends the event!!!&quot;<br>&quot;WHAT'D IT DROP????????????&quot;<br>&quot;Umm.... Bracer of Mucus&quot;<br>&quot;KEWL! STATS???&quot;<br>&quot;Ummmm.... +5 Save vs. Disease and 40AC&quot;<br>&quot;OMFG!!! I WANT ONE!!!!!:<br>&quot;ME TOO!&quot;<br>&quot;ME TOO!&quot;<br>&quot;Taking bids on bracer. I'll give loc to highest bid... hurry, it's rotting!&quot;<br>&quot;d00d - ur a l00ser... let everyone take their turn&quot;<br>&quot;shut up&quot;<br>&quot;no you shut up&quot;<br>&quot;I'm tracking a Voracious Nosehair&quot;<br>&quot;DON'T KILL IT!!!&quot;<br>&quot;DUDE! Don't kill it!!! It ends the event!!!!!&quot;<br>&quot;Donating 200pp for loc of a Bracer of Mucus!&quot;<br>&quot;Killing a Voracious Nosehair&quot;<br>&quot;NOOOOO!!!!&quot;<br>&quot;You're a jerk!&quot;<br>&quot;shut up&quot;<br>&quot;no YOU shut up&quot;<br>&quot;EVERYBODY SHUT UP!&quot;<br>&quot;Voracious Nosehair is dead!&quot;<br>&quot;You're a jerk. BTW, what'd it drop?&quot;<br>&quot;when does the event start up again?????&quot;<br><br><br>And on... and on... and on... All from an event that could have been cool had we just known that an evil wizard had miscast a spell and given life to his sinus infection. But the events become less about the story, and more about the lewt - leading to an immediate zone population of 150+ (when it's normally 20) consisting mostly of guild folks with access to a wizard or druid that can port them there.<br><br>So what's the alternative? Given the limitations of the game and EQ?s architecture, there aren't a lot. I always dreamed, however, of a scenario something like this:<br><br>I'm in a group that is working well together. Maybe we've grouped for the first time, maybe we're a regular party, but we're having a good time together and wasting just about everything we come across. Somewhere, the GM is watching and identifies us as a group that works well together. The event begins when a wandering (GM) character approaches our group and begs for assistance - a band of orcs has abducted his sister. <br><br>Or a powerful mage appears in a thunderclap and tells us that she has rewards beyond imagination for all, but we must prove ourselves worthy first and proceeds to send us on a quest. Even better, she hires us to accompany her at 10pp a day plus whatever loot we can carry and then we all go on the quest together. It wouldn't be too difficult to hide quests of this sort so that they could only be started with the pass-phrase given by the GM. Heck, most people have a hard enough time finding real EQ quests without searching one of the fine web sites like Allakhazam (worth every cent of the premium fee, by the way) or shouting to an entire zone to find out what a Sarnak War Braid is used for...<br><br>Now maybe if the events were *always* going on, they wouldn't have quite the draw that they normally do and behaviors would change. I hope that's the case for Legends servers, because I'd be pretty ticked off to pay extra for the dubious privilege of living in a constant GM event atmosphere as it exists on Zebuxoruk<br><br>I've read the interviews about Legends and I don't doubt that $40/month is indeed the magic number that Verant needs to charge to run the servers, pay for bandwidth, pay salaries, make Legends a self-sufficient cost/profit center. But it's about $20-25 more than I'm willing to pay.<br><br>Perhaps it's my loss. Perhaps I'm not hardcore enough. But so be it - for now, I'll stay on Zebuxoruk and wreak my havoc and terror there. There may never be a spell named &quot;Ynar's Acid Tongue,&quot; but heck... enough people on Zebux already know that Ynar has an acid tongue!<br><br><br>APPENDIX<br><br>Ok, I just finished reading another interview about the legends server, this time with one of the GMs. It appears that many of my concerns are actually being addressed on the Legends server (and I can count on one hand the number of times that Verant and I actually thought similarly on an issue).<br><br>There are two quotes of note:<br><br>Q: How will you prevent people flocking to zones for quest loot?<br><br>A: One of the things you will see is a change in Focus whereby not all quests will be obvious and large-scale. Many will be small group based quests that will not get the attention of entire guilds of people.<br><br><br>Very nice! This is exactly what I was talking about. And:<br><br><br>Q: Will GM's contact me when events are on?<br><br>A: Not directly no. But if you are in a group don't be surprised if one day some strange NPC comes up and starts interacting with your party. You can then choose to participate or not.<br><br><br>It's almost like they were reading my mind. Now if only they could drop the price by $15-20, I'd be hard-pressed not to upgrade. Ultimately, though, I don't play enough to slog through trying to level another necromancer. I've been playing since last June and have only reached 33 with Ynar (34 any day now). And I'd hate to transfer Ynar because I've made so many great friends. So maybe someday I'll move to legends.<br><br>But not today.<br><br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Feb 25 22:37:57 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Bene Moriore!<br>Ynar - Necromancer of the 8th Circle, Zebuxoruk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, my journal isn't turning out as what I had originally intended it to be. I had originally planned for a more role-play oriented character journal for my primary (Ynar, Level 31 Necromancer on Zebuxoruk). I'd always wanted to try my hand at some fiction writing, and this seemed like an easy introduction.<br><br>However, I find myself being more interested in talking about the Everquest experience than in documenting what Ynar does in-game. More than likely, you play the game too, and have seen much of what I would describe.<br><br>Instead, today I'll recount my recent departure from and subsequent return to Norrath.<br><br>It all happened around Halloween. The GM events were in full force and I, like so many others, was rabidly in pursuit of nice goodies. This was the beginning of the end. I saw greed turn so many (ordinarily nice) people into lewt-grubbing jerks, that the events stopped being fun.<br><br>Then they just wouldn't stop! I expected maybe a day or two... but a week? I started cheering for the people who were going after the NPCs that would end an event. I sympathized with the people who didn't get that special trinket (I never did get that nice cloak), but I was ready to get back to normal EQ life. I was in the middle of my first hell level, and getting experience was next to impossible with most people swarming the event zones all the time.<br><br>Then came *the patch.* If you've read my first journal entry, you already know how I feel about the coin drop issue and there's no point in recounting it here. Suffice to say, however, that this was more or less the final straw. I was officially burned out.<br><br>I rediscovered real life. I watched TV. I got remotivated on some particularly dull projects at work. I traveled and visited family without wishing I was playing EQ. It was refreshing.<br><br>Just after Thanksgiving, I got an email from the folks at Anarchy Online. I had purchased the game in the summer, but cancelled my account because it was just too buggy and slow. The email said that they had made lots of improvements and invited me to try the game again for another 30 days at no charge. This is the kind of customer service and attention that I wish Verant would exhibit more often.<br><br>So I played AO for a few weeks. Not nearly as hard as I had played EQ, but I enjoyed the experience. Ultimately, I just didn't get into AO as much as EQ, but I think it's definitely a viable game now. I didn't continue my account at the end of the trial period, though.<br><br>During the holiday break I tried logging back into EQ a couple of times, but just never felt like doing anything. I was afraid that my burnout was permanent.<br><br>But one day a few weeks ago, out of the blue - I felt like playing. Maybe I just needed some time to decompress - I'm certainly not as serious as I used to be about the game, and if I miss a night of playing, I don't begrudge whatever it is that I'm doing instead. <br><br>I wish I could level more quickly, but Verant seems intent to keep the game artificially long, so I'm not as worried about it as I used to be. I'm still ticked off about the coin dropping thing, though.<br><br>Ultimately, I enjoy EQ a lot. It's a wonderful world to explore, and that's what I'm doing more of these days. Now I'm more interested in leveling up so I can see some of the zones I've never been to. I do have to admit, however, that it's a really nice, somewhat guilty pleasure to go back and stomp on some NPC or Mob that made your life a living hell in the early days (Phaeril Nightshire, I'm looking in your direction). I'm currently exploring the Ocean of Tears. It's an interesting zone, and I'm one skill point away from being a master swimmer.<br><br>So while this isn't new or earth shattering advice - take a break every now and then. You'll end up appreciating the game even more!<br>&nbsp;<br>Bene Moriore!<br>Ynar - Necromancer of the 8th Circle, Zebuxoruk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This may be a dubious beginning to my journal, but since Verant decided to bury my post on the subject and not let others hear my argument, I have to post it here.<br><br>As part of this week's patch, Verant finally bowed to the desires of the majority of its customers and removed the heinous Trivial Loot Code (or "Anti-Bottom-Feeding" code as some like to call it) from The Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains. I applaud them for this.<br><br>The TLC was a reaction to a problem that can definitely be frustrating for many young characters - farming by high levels in low level zones. Unfortunately, the solution provided was indicative of a fundamental disagreement I've developed with Verant's game administration philosophy: a seemingly arbitrary and arrogant willingness to limit the enjoyment of a majority of its customers based on the preferences of its game design staff.<br><br>In a nutshell, my argument is this: It is not Verant's place to tell me how I will best enjoy the game.<br><br>Now don't get me wrong, this is Verant's product, and they are free to make it behave in any manner they see fit. But please don't try to tell me that it's "more realistic" that the Kobold King in The Warrens would magically not be carrying an item simply because he was killed by a stronger person... Verant continued to try and justify the TLC by saying that "a real high level character wouldn't have time to do these things himself and would get lower level characters to do menial tasks." This is exactly the kind of attitude that makes me the most angry.<br><br>My character doesn't *trust* underlings to do the job. (And on a side note, I enjoy collecting my own bone chips... sometimes you need a break from the adventure). But with TLC, Verant was *forcing* me into a role that I didn't want to play.<br><br>But happily, Verant has decided to do away with TLC because it was so overwhelmingly disliked.<br><br>Unfortunately, Verant has given with the right hand and taken with the left, because in the very same patch, we lost the ability to drop coin.<br><br>This is ludicrous. Once again, Verant has chosen the most heavy-handed method possible to address a relatively minor problem - the potential for new characters to be scammed into dropping their coin.<br><br>Now the easiest and least intrusive solution to this problem would have been for Verant to simply add the confirmation dialog box present when you try to drop an item on the ground. Instead, because they "couldn't see any valid reason" to drop coin, they removed the ability entirely.<br><br>Instead of providing us with an option, they forced a behavior on us. I am no longer able to anonymously drop coin in newbie gardens. As a player, I like to help other characters. As a Necromancer, it isn't in my character to give coin to a halfling. Now I have to make a choice... either compromise my character and come up with some rationalization to fit Verant's preference, or just not help other players any more.<br><br>Then there is the whole twinking issue. Now I don't really twink my alternate characters, but to be honest, I hate the process of getting from level 1 to the mid-teens. I've done it once, and I don't really have any desire to do it again. More to the point, it's not Verant's place to tell me that I *should* enjoy it. Before the coin drop nerf, if I wanted to play through those levels, I could, and if I didn't want to, well it wasn't difficult to provide some coin to the new toon to get past those levels as quickly as possible.<br><br>(Yes, I can still trade coin between toons by using a 3rd party, but I either risk the coin with someone I don't know, or inconvienence one of my friends).<br><br>Verant's additional justification was that they were having a great deal of customer support traffic with people who had inadvertantly dropped coin and wanted it back, in spite of the stated policy that a GM *will not* restore coin or items.<br><br>I say that they'll just trade one support issue for another as people who lose coin in bad twinking decisions make exactly the same petitions.<br><br>It's my belief that Verant wanted to make twinking more difficult and found a way to do it without looking like they were doing it directly. It's pretty obvious, however, that they went out of their way to avoid the obvious solution that would have the least impact on people (confirmation box) and went with the ham-fisted "you will do what we want" approach that is becoming increasingly less tolerable with each new instance.<br><br>Verant has done an amazing job creating a fabulous world that I am absolutely hooked on. But it has developed an attitude that it can tell me how I'll best enjoy the game, and I don't appreciate that one bit. For a long time, it has been able to force that attitude on its customer base because it was far and away the best MMORPG in the world. That's going to change in the next year or two, and Verant needs to reevaluate its position or risk&nbsp;&nbsp;alienating its customer base.<br><br>Verant, you can tell me the rules of the world you've created, you can even change the rules on a whim, but please quit trying to rationalize your preferences by telling me that I will enjoy the game more with your new restrictions. You don't know how I most enjoy the game.<br><br>Twinking and leaving coins for other players didn't hurt anyone else, and most likely caused the people doing those things to enjoy themselves. Removing coin dropping annoys most of us and makes the game less enjoyable.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bene Moriore!<br>Ynar - Necromancer of the 8th Circle, Zebuxoruk</td></tr>
