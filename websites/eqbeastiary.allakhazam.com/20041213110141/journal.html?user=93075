In December of 2002 I was part of a layoff and had to send my PC back to the company (I'm a Mac guy most of the time), so I had no computer on which to play EQ and no cash with which to buy a PC.<br><br>Fast forward to last October. A consulting gig finally came through that required me to build a PC for myself. With some hesitation, I purchased EQ Evolutions and the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansions. I wasn't sure if I really would play as much, but wanted to say hello to all my old friends on Zebuxoruk.<br><br>Ah, who was I kidding? I'm as addicted as ever - maybe even more so. Sony has added some really nice features to the game and LDoN is a lot of fun. When I left Ynar he was level 52. Within six weeks I had him at 55. He's now 57. For those of you laughing at my advancement rate, I should remind you that it took me nearly a year to reach level 36. I do a lot of questing and trade skills (damn you prayer shawl quests!) so I haven't concentrated on leveling as much as some do.<br><br>I even started my epic quest a few days ago. I may never finish it, but it's been fun so far. While the necromancer epic item isn't that great, the process is certainly entertaining. My biggest quandry now is whether or not I want to find a guild. I never took a last name, and I roleplay a lot. I like being the mysterious loner necromancer wandering the lands.<br><br>Still, there are things I'll never see without a guild, so I know I'll eventually need to find one. As I start grouping with more and more high level characters, I'm learning which of the guilds are militant and which are fun. I'll never join a guild that conducts mandatory raids - EQ is a game: it's what I do to relieve stress, not cause it.<br><br>It's good to be back from the dead. And it's still good to be a necro. =-)</p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>-- Bene Moriore</td></tr>

But I'm back, and this one might be a doozy. as I wait for the Halloween festivities to begin - both online and at my front door. <br><br>So sit back, grab your favorite beverage and enjoy the rantish stylings of Ynar...<br><br>First off, wow! Responses! I didn't think anyone would ever respond. Thank you to both of you. Phreda, there's not much chance of me going the fiction route now... heh heh.<br><br>Kythian, thanks very much for your comments. Regarding the relative egotism of necromancers, well, I certainly can't disagree with you. I've found (especially since discovering the necro.eqclasses.com board and the serverwide necromancer channel) that there are indeed quite a few necromancers who have a superiority complex. The question in my mind is, did they become that way because of the powers of the necromancer, or did they choose the necromancer as a class because it matched their own real-life persona?<br><br>To be sure, Necromancers are a powerful class. Even after years of nerfing with little compensation (things have gotten better over the last 6 months or so), there are few things that necromancers can't do. Interestingly, while druids and shadow knights are examples of the official &quot;hybrid&quot; class, it's my opinion that necromancers actually fit that description a little more closely.<br><br>While we don't have the melee or armor skills, we do have such a wide variety of abilities that it's possible to fill many roles. Unfortunately, that versatility comes with a price - the classic &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; dilemma.<br><br>Still, that doesn't stop a few (well, maybe more than a few) abrasive necromancers from giving the entire class a reputed black eye. Add to that the relatively low number of necromancers (the last statistic I saw put us as the second lowest played class) and the chance that you're going to come across a &quot;jerkromancer&quot; is pretty high.<br><br>Some of the necromancer community exhibits some definite minority group behavioral traits - an inherent defensivenes, paranoia, and an overwhelming willingness to help our own at the expense of others. I've watched necromancers sit and do nothing while someone yelled for help 30 feet away, and I've seen necromancers drop everything they're doing to help another necromancer on the other side of the world...<br><br>Still - is this an inherent class trait? Does playing a necromancer produce these behaviors? Logically, no... there are two types of characters in EQ - those that are a complete fantasy for the player... a role that they would never assume in real life (the dashing hero, the evil sorcerer, a male, a female). Then there are those whose characters are mostly an extension of themselves. I certainly fall into the latter category. Even when I'm roleplaying, my outlook is that Ynar is not evil, he's just fascinated with learning as much as he can and found reanimation of the dead interesting.<br><br>And I try to help others whenever I can, whether roleplaying or not - but that's because I like to help others in the game.<br><br>So perhaps I should amend my earlier post about grouping with necromancers to say this:<br><br>Don't be afraid to invite a necromancer into your group, and be sure to give him or her a chance to learn your group's dynamics and style. But don't be afraid to kick a necromancer (or any player for that matter) who is rude, does things that endanger the group, or acts like a cowboy. I've kicked necromancers for those things in my own groups.<br><br>BUT - if you find a good necromancer, cherish them, love them, and invite them to group and raid often. Yes, we are a solo class, and many of us chose the class because we didn't have time to properly play a &quot;group only&quot; class, but the truly talented necromancer will always be a boon to your success. and appreciates all the nice attention. and the chance to get some additional lewt that we can't get by ourselves.<br><br><b>The Everquest Atlas</b><br>For those of you who don't know, Sony has released the Everquest Atlas, an attractive, full color, spiral bound book of nearly 600 pages. The back of the box glowingly says that the &quot;rich and mysterious world of EverQuest is opened to players in a full-color book that uncovers the wonders of Norrath in fantastic detail.&quot;<br><br>It goes on to say that it includes &quot;over 170 full-color maps - which include the forthcoming EverQuest: The Planes of Power expansion.&quot;<br><br>Now, I'm a huge fan of Muse and the www.eqatlas.com site. It's helped me through many a zone and to avoid many a death. But I thought I'd take the chance on this $19.95 tome of maps because it would be nice to have a book next to the computer instead of looking back and forth from one computer to the other, and the book promised to have some maps that I can't currently get from eqatlas.com.<br><br>Make no mistake, this book is gorgeous! It's just the right size to have next to the keyboard, spiral bound so it lays flat, satisfyingly heavy, and attractively laid out. The &quot;laser&quot; style cover is pretty cool as well.<br><br>And that's about it.<br><br>While I can't say that it was a complete waste of money, I can say that this is definitely a &quot;Close, but no cigar&quot; product. It had enormous potential to be a fantastic reference and guide, but falls just short of the mark.<br><br>Let me illustrate a few of the shortcomings of the book.<br><br>1. No coordinates. Maps are a representative form of design - they are most often a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional space, and are an extrordinarily rich form of information/communication. The most basic function of a map is to show you where things are in relation to each other. The book's maps do this. But without coordinates, you have to identify where you are in the first place... not always the easiest task. Not an insurmountable problem, but a coordinate grid would have made this book <b>much</b> more useful.<br><br>2. Weird perspective. All of the maps are drawn in 3/4 perspective. While making for a pretty drawing, it does make doing things like... oh... adding coordinates a little bit harder. To make things more difficult, North is often not &quot;up&quot; on the page. This is sometimes a necessary evil when a zone is much wider than it is tall (like the Plane of Knowledge), but when North is always changing, it makes it just a tad slower to get oriented. Again, not a huge problem, but sometimes annoying.<br><br>3. Limited information. This is one of the big, fat, glaring problems with the book. As an example, the map for North Freeport gives a whopping 5 locations: The zone line, the Temple of Marr, the hall of Truth, The bank, and the bard's guild. That's it. No merchant information, no NPC locations, etc. The timorous deep description mentions the raptors, but doesn't give you any clue where they might be located.<br><br>4. Incorrect information. My only example of this so far is that the Dreadlands description shows the monster level as being 1-10. This is most likely just an unfortunate, isolated typo, but if Sony is going to promote this book as being worth the price because you're getting information straight from the source, they darn well better make sure that the information is accurate...<br><br>5. The planes. This is perhaps my biggest gripe with the book. There are only two or three maps of the planes. The plane of Knowledge is fairly well mapped, but it's already in the PoP expansion manual. There are one or two rough maps (Innovation, Tranquility), but for the most part, the Planes are represented by some artwork - a guilliotene for Justice, a shipwrecked coast for Storms, and some that might be maps, but not having been there, I can't tell for sure. They sure don't feel like maps in any case.<br><br>Now I know what you're saying... &quot;Ynar, Sony wants people to explore the Planes and discover the unknown.&quot; Fine. I have no problem with that. Until you recall the back of the box that you can read through the shrinkwrap: &quot;over 170 maps - which include the forthcoming Everquest: The Planes of Power expansion.&quot;<br><br>Misleading at best.<br><br>And quite frankly, the planes maps were the primary reason for my deciding to pony up twenty bucks for the book, since there seems to be some political brouhaha or snubbing going on between Sony and Muse over at eqatlas.com (according to his site, he wasn't invited to beta test the PoP expansion and leaves it to the reader to figure out why that might be). If eqatlas wasn't going to have the maps, the book would be a big help.<br><br>Also, if Sony really wants me to explore and discover everything on my own, why did they publish an atlas?<br><br>So knowing that Muse wasn't likely to have maps of the planes any time soon, and seeing that the box advertised maps of the planes, I bought the hype. Caveat Emptor, baby.<br><br>So what does the book do right? Well, there's some really nice descriptive text that not only gives you an indication (albeit sometimes a vague indication) of what to expect from a zone. Much of the lore and backstory is provided, and it's fun to read.<br><br>In addition, there are &quot;maps&quot; of zones that aren't readily available on the main EQ sites that I visit (e.g. eqatlas.com). And did I mention that the artwork is really pretty?<br><br>But essentially, what Sony has published is the book that should have been in the box. I recognize that Sony doesn't want to provide spoiler information, but representing this product as an atlas that &quot;uncovers the wonders of Norrath in fantastic detail&quot; is *really* stretching it.<br><br>When I bought the Prima guides, I figured out that I had really just paid $20 for information that was already available on the internet and that should have been in the user manual. But ok, now I have it all in one place and in an easy to use form, and this seems to have become the standard practice in the software gaming industry - publish a crappy, bare bones instruction manual, and rake in another $20 with a misnamed &quot;strategy guide.&quot; (But that's another rant. :) )<br><br>In the case of this atlas, however, the information isn't even as good as what's on the internet. Close, but no cigar.<br><br>So my bottom line recommendation is this: take that $20 and buy yourself a a few more months of Allakhazam premium service and send the rest to Muse via paypal. He's giving you a lot better value and information and can use the money a lot more than Sony.<br><br>If however, you're a completist and really want a &quot;keepsake&quot; type item with lore, nice descriptive text, illustratons, screenshots, etc. the Everquest Atlas from Sony isn't a horrible purchase - it just isn't what it says it is.<br><br>Well, by now your coffee is cold and my fingers are numb. The trick-or-treaters have stopped ringing my doorbell and the porch light is off, so it's off to Norrath I go to try and grab some phat halloween lewt! And probably to die a few times.<br><br>Safe journeying and journaling!<br><br>Ynar - Heretic of Zebuxoruk<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Nov&nbsp;&nbsp;1 00:01:32 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>-- Bene Moriore</td></tr>

Your style is tight, and to the point... not to mention clear. So few people have the proper talent to fully express their opinions in writing. In this category you shine.<br><br>Now, for some reponses to your previous posts.<br><br><br>On Coin Dropping, Burnout and Rediscovery<br><br>I agree with you completely that the coin-dropping issue was heavy-handed. I know of many monks (in particular) and low-strength classes (in general) that often dropped piles of coins to lighten their load. Personally, I've always destroyed my coins, but that's a personal preference stemming from an abhorance to littering. After all, my main character is a druid. *Grin*<br><br>On burnout, I can say that I have been there many times myself. I am a veteran player (though I hope not a snobby one), having played since the original release and even knowing one of the original beta testers. So my exposure to EQ started long before I activated my account. There have been many times throughout the years that I have simply walked away, most recently for over two months. I eventually gravitate back and start playing again, but it comes and goes. Rather, &quot;I&quot; come and go. Suffice it to say, it's not so much the game that brings me back, but the odd companionship.<br><br><br>Legends - Timeless or Moldy?<br><br>I agree that $40 per month is entirely too much to pay for something that we should have had since the begining. The only real thing I can add to your comments on the matter is that with the release of Anarchy Online, Dark Ages of Camelot and the others peeking over the horizon, Verant will be taking a serious look at the way things operate. If they don't, they'll tank. In fact, the primary reasoning for getting rid of the spellbook while meditating (at least, presumably) is due to the influence of DAoC.<br><br>So long as Verant continues to provide these subtle improvements, and stears clear of any more heavy-handed &quot;fixes&quot;, EQ will continue to thrive.<br><br><br>If you've never grouped with a necro...<br><br>In fact I have. On several occasions. And this is what I have discovered. (Please feel free to comment on this one as you see fit.)<br><br>In general, necromancers are cocky. Sometimes even arrogant. But, admitedly, not without some cause.<br><br>Necromancers are very powerful. They can solo as well as anyone, if not better. They have a wide array of powers available to help them handle (quite frankly) ANY situation. This is good. And bad. Many of the necros that I have encountered in the game have swollen egos (I don't know if this is a pre-existing condition, or something that happens when the player selects the necro upon log in, but it's very consistent) and have no qualms about letting everyone know.<br><br>On the other hand, there have been a few exceptional ones. These ones are a scream (no pun intended) to group with! They nearly as versitile as a bard. Sometimes better! Have you ever seen a druid and a necromancer paired up? You have never seen such a frightening sight.<br><br>Chloroplast (or Regenerate, at lower levels) on the Necro, one of the various Thorn spells on the pet, Skin Like Nature (at level 49 and up) on the Necro AND pet! SoW, heals (big enough to keep a necro alive, if not a warrior), DoT's that stack with each other (gotta love Breath of Ro and Splurt working together!), the nightmare goes on!<br><br>All in all, I avoid necromancers. But when I find a good one, the experience, loot, and most important, the fun just roll in.<br><br><br>I don't really have anything constructive to add to the two most recent posts, so I'll conclude with this: Keep posting. I find your arguements well constructed and intriguing (sp?). Very thought provoking.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Jul 11 13:08:41 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>"Walk in the light, and you will be seen.

This is a major patch that will change the way many of us play the game. What remains to be seen is whether this patch will be a St. Patty's Day Celebration or a victim of the Ides of March...<br><br>From my point of view, there aren't many things to dislike about this patch unless you're one of the Snobby EQ Veterans I griped about a couple of entries ago. While there is a small part of me that wants others to suffer through 34 levels of staring at a spellbook (especially since I *just* got to level 35 about a week ago), the more rational side of me knows that this was just a pain that nobody should suffer through.<br><br>I've read several well-communicated opinions on both sides of the experience debate, and while there may be an increase in high-level characters without all of the skills they need, I don't think it's going to be the massive problem some people are gnashing their teeth over.<br><br>Why? Well, there might be one or two times when someone without crowd control skills leads to the death of their party, but EQ's inherent Darwinism will take care of that. Players without appropriate skills will either learn those skills, or they will quickly develop a reputation and not get in any more groups.<br><br>There are two reasons I'm excited about these changes:<br><br>1. It will make it much easier for me to play another character. I have a limited amount of time to play - I can't spend 8 hours a day getting my toons up to the 50s... it's taken me nearly a year to get my primary up to 36. <br><br>The randomized skinner box model is still there, but making it less frustrating can only make things better, in my opinion, for both the players *and* Verant. I'll be happier because the game is slightly easier and I'm more able to enjoy other classes more readily, and Verant will profit because I'll be more likely to stay subscribed so I can get that mage or bard leveled up as well...<br><br>2. By removing some of the artificial game-lengthening aspects, Verant has actually (to my surprise) made the game more enjoyable for the majority of players instead of trying to push some strange philosophy/dogma or spurious rationale to make the game harder and longer (thus increasing the amount of time people are likely to subscribe).<br><br>For whatever reason (change in management, economic forces), Verant seems to be making fundamental changes in the game that nearly everyone wanted. I hope that this signals a new customer-satisfaction focus from Verant. They have a fantastic product that I love to play, I'm even more inclined to stay subscribed if they treat me nicely as well.<br><br>There are a few things that I disagree with in the changes - I think Clerics should still be the primary resurrection artists... there aren't many other reasons to suffer through the boredom that is a Cleric's life.<br><br>There was also one change that didn't make it in, that I thought should have been included. Since Luclin came out, the Wizard and Druid porting skills (and subsequent income potential) dropped. It's my opinion that the availability of various port spells should be changed. West Commons should now be one of the first port spells these classes receive, and Toxx forest one of the last. This way, there would still be an in-demand income-producing service that wizzies and dr00ds could provide during those levels when you really need money to equip yourself for the higher levels in the game.<br><br>Perhaps that will be looked at in a future patch. I hope so. I don't have a wizard or a druid, but I feel for those who do. At the same time, however, the ability to port quickly through Luclin made the game *incredibly* more enjoyable for me.<br><br>One final comment (and this one is definitely a biased one), I think that the cost for components for spells like Summon Corpse should be in line with the amount of money people are willing to pay for the service, especially for the level that a spell becomes available.<br><br>Lesser Summon Corpse is now available to low level necromancers and Summon Corpse is now available at Level 39. Yet according to the databases I've seen, the cost of a coffin is still very high. <br><br>If a coffin costs 100pp, a necromancer really needs to charge at least 130 to 150 to make a decent profit covering not only the high cost of the component, but to make up for the relative popularity of the service. Even in the high 30s and low to mid 40s, 150pp to summon a corpse is pretty steep, and most people will ask the necro to simply track the corpse instead (if they don't just go find it themselves).<br><br>I've never been offered (nor have I asked) for a donation for tracking a corpse... it's just not something that people attach a value to unless their corpse is about to rot along with all their gear. But that is rarely the case.<br><br>Everyone has needed to get to the commons quickly at some point, and I still see lots of shouts for ports. I've never *ever* seen a shout for someone to summon a corpse. If the component cost me 20pp and I could charge 25 or 30pp (in line with other time-saving services like ports), then I think many more people would find the service advantageous.<br><br>I don't know the details on the difference between Lesser Summon Corpse and Summon Corpse, nor do I know if there's an additional spell in the line, but the main point I'm trying to make is that when components are prohibitively expensive, nobody will ask for the service.</p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>-- Bene Moriore</td></tr>

Great solo class, but pretty sucky in a group, right?<br><br>I don't think so.<br><br>I've found during my time in Norrath that Necromancers are frequently underestimated and misunderstood. I thought I'd take advantage of this downtime (there appears to have been a meltdown after today's patch) to outline some of the things that necromancers can do that you might not be aware of.<br><br>There are some obvious ones: tracking or summoning corpses, curing rabies and other diseases (we work with the undead a lot so we have to be able to cure all the lovely things they carry), and a full line of spells that affect the undead (damage, root, charm, etc.) But there are several necromancer abilities that almost always evoke a &quot;You can do THAT?&quot; from groups I'm in...<br><br>(Note that I'm only at level 33, so there are even more things available at higher levels, but if you're a high level, you've probably learned about necromancers already. =-)<br><br>Pets<br>====<br>The most obvious sign of the necromancer is the little skeleton buddy following him around. This might seem obvious, but many people forget that this pet is another pair of hands beating on a mob. Even better, a pet only takes 1% of the experience in a group no matter how much damage it does. You probably don't want a necro pet tanking regularly, but it's a great assistant damage dealer.<br><br>Think of a necro and his pet as a melee/caster combination. Higher level necro pets are actually different classes. Later necro pets can be necros (with lifetap) rogues (with backstab) or monks (with a flying kick). <br><br><br>Healer<br>======<br>At lower levels, a necromancer can make a pretty effective healer with the pact line of spells, especially as backup healer. Sure it might be kind of spooky to know that the necro is draining her own blood to give you HP, but do you really want to refuse the help? From level 30 until 44, this becomes less and less powerful, but it might be enough to keep you from dying from a DOT...<br><br><br>Snare<br>=====<br>The darkness line of spells give necromancers a great combo: snare and dot in one spell! As an example, the Level 29 Dooming Darkness spell not only slows movement by 60%, it also does up to 300 damage. That's just gravy if you're already needing to snare.<br><br><br>Root<br>====<br>We get it later than other classes, but once at level 34, a necro can root with the best of 'em.<br><br><br>Mez<br>===<br>That's right, I said mez. At level 24, we get a spell called Screaming Terror that mezzes a mob for 18 seconds. What's more, there's even a chance for an aggro memory wipe (but don't count on it). Unfortunately, a great deal of necro gear lowers charisma which can lead to resists, so don't ask a necro who's never tried mezzing to do it when you absolutely need it. A necro who's tried will know whether or not they have a dependable mez.<br><br>Remember also, that if the mez breaks early, that mob is going to be breathing down that necro's... er... neck. So be ready to taunt.<br><br><br>Feign Pulling/Splitting<br>=======================<br>Used infrequently, but still something to think about, necros can use Feign Death to pull a mob or root/feign split a spawn just like a monk. Unlike monks, however, a necro's FD is a spell (with a chance for a fizzle) so it's not as dependable as a monk.<br><br><br>The Mana Battery (&quot;Twitching the Healer&quot;)<br>=========================================<br>This is the big enchilada. At level 24, necros get a spell that will probably change their role in groups - especially in raid situations: the first in the Subversion line of spells. <br><br>I love using this spell in lower level zones on unsuspecting casters. I watch a caster fight and fight and fight, then come back to med, expecting a 5 minute wait while that mana bar slowly crawls up to full.<br><br>Then BAM! Full mana.<br><br>It does my black heart no end of good to hear &quot;WHAT WAS THAT???&quot;<br><br>The subversion line transfers mana from the necro to any targeted caster. When both are roughly equal in levels, it's about a two to one ratio (one bub of my mana will give you a half-bub). We become the clerics of mana and (not surprisingly) often end up mana-healing clerics. =-)<br><br>Here's the drill (it might sound complicated, but it really isn't). I convert my HP into mana. I give the mana to a needy caster. I then drain a mob of their HP to replenish mine. Wash, rinse, repeat.<br><br>It can sometimes be more efficient for the party healer to just heal the necro instead of counting on the necro to drain HP from a mob. My personal favorite is to get a regenerate from a shaman, then cast my mana drain spell. It's a poor man's clarity. Even better would be a real clarity, eliminating the need for HP conversion.<br><br>Pulling goes on much longer when the healer or nuker doesn't have to med as much.<br><br><br><br>So there you have it! A necromancer will never replace an enchanter for mezzing, or a monk for feigning, or a warrior for tanking, but they're a great class that can play several different roles in a group. (Plus, we're generally really nice people deep down. No, seriously. I mean it. Quit laughing.)<br></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>-- Bene Moriore</td></tr>

I'll leave my original post as is, but will append additional thoughts at the end.<br><br><br><br>So... Verant has now come out with Everquest Legends - a premium service at a very premium price. I won't bother to make the business school case for this product. I think it makes sense for Verant and a small portion of EQ players, and frankly, it looks like pretty cool.<br><br>In fact, it looks like what I thought Everquest was going to be when I first subscribed last summer.<br><br>First, the positives. <br><br>* Lots of events<br>* A truly dynamic world where what you do might actually have an impact<br>* Lower server populations<br>* (Presumably) fewer low-quality players (the kind that train you, or still can't effectively group despite having a level 40 toon, etc.)<br><br>That last one is a double-edged two-handed slash weapon, though. I've found that there are two types of EQ players that annoy me to no end. First, &quot;The n00b&quot; (as opposed to newbie) who doesn't care about the game, doesn't want to care about the game, and generally only cares about leveling, phat lewt, and going to Lake of Ill Manners to start arguments (&quot;What's the best class?&quot;).<br><br>Secondly, and perhaps controversially, is the Snobby EQ Veteran. This person is, in my mind, the same person as Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons. (&quot;Worst Zone Patch Ever.&quot;) They have 7 characters at level 60, 12 more in the 50s, and are so damn elitist that you just want to slap them. These are the same people who frequently get their knickers in a twist when you inspect &quot;without permission&quot; (THE HORROR!!!). I won't bring that debate up here except to say that 1. I don't care if you inspect me - Verant put that there because they couldn't accomplish the same thing in the graphics engine and 2. If you do care, just turn off the stupid message! It's very easy to do.<br><br>(Note that not all people who are offended by inspection are Snobby EQ Veterans, but nearly all Snobby EQ Veterans are offended by inspection.)<br><br>Unfortunately, it's my suspicion that there will be a higher-than-normal concentration of these so-called &quot;serious&quot; players on the Legends servers, and that's almost enough by itself to keep me on Zebuxoruk.<br><br>Almost, but not quite. I would gladly ignore the elite and sign up for legends were it not for its one overwhelming drawback:<br><br>It costs $40 a month!<br><br>Now, I'm just a simple Necromancer and not too good at math, but I believe that adds up to $480 a year! I thought $120 was steep! Don't get me wrong, EQ is still a pretty good bargain when it comes to cost/time. I play a lot of EQ and when you break it down on a per hour basis, I think I get my money's worth.<br><br>But I have yet to see a GM event that's worth an extra $30 per month. These events typically turn whatever zone they afflict into a madhouse of chaotic shouts, name calling, flames, and generally poor behavior. It's my feeling that this is because events have little focus, even less back-story, and almost no information provided ahead of time to allow people to get into the event and play the storyline out. Thus we are treated to:<br><br>&quot;Is the event starting&quot;<br>&quot;About to.&quot;<br>&quot;I JUST KILLED A HAIRY PHLEGMBALL!!!&quot;<br>&quot;WHAT'D IT DROP?????&quot;<br>&quot;DAMN NEAR KILLED ME!!!&quot;<br>&quot;Don't kill the Voracious Nosehair - it ends the event!!!&quot;<br>&quot;WHAT'D IT DROP????????????&quot;<br>&quot;Umm.... Bracer of Mucus&quot;<br>&quot;KEWL! STATS???&quot;<br>&quot;Ummmm.... +5 Save vs. Disease and 40AC&quot;<br>&quot;OMFG!!! I WANT ONE!!!!!:<br>&quot;ME TOO!&quot;<br>&quot;ME TOO!&quot;<br>&quot;Taking bids on bracer. I'll give loc to highest bid... hurry, it's rotting!&quot;<br>&quot;d00d - ur a l00ser... let everyone take their turn&quot;<br>&quot;shut up&quot;<br>&quot;no you shut up&quot;<br>&quot;I'm tracking a Voracious Nosehair&quot;<br>&quot;DON'T KILL IT!!!&quot;<br>&quot;DUDE! Don't kill it!!! It ends the event!!!!!&quot;<br>&quot;Donating 200pp for loc of a Bracer of Mucus!&quot;<br>&quot;Killing a Voracious Nosehair&quot;<br>&quot;NOOOOO!!!!&quot;<br>&quot;You're a jerk!&quot;<br>&quot;shut up&quot;<br>&quot;no YOU shut up&quot;<br>&quot;EVERYBODY SHUT UP!&quot;<br>&quot;Voracious Nosehair is dead!&quot;<br>&quot;You're a jerk. BTW, what'd it drop?&quot;<br>&quot;when does the event start up again?????&quot;<br><br><br>And on... and on... and on... All from an event that could have been cool had we just known that an evil wizard had miscast a spell and given life to his sinus infection. But the events become less about the story, and more about the lewt - leading to an immediate zone population of 150+ (when it's normally 20) consisting mostly of guild folks with access to a wizard or druid that can port them there.<br><br>So what's the alternative? Given the limitations of the game and EQ?s architecture, there aren't a lot. I always dreamed, however, of a scenario something like this:<br><br>I'm in a group that is working well together. Maybe we've grouped for the first time, maybe we're a regular party, but we're having a good time together and wasting just about everything we come across. Somewhere, the GM is watching and identifies us as a group that works well together. The event begins when a wandering (GM) character approaches our group and begs for assistance - a band of orcs has abducted his sister. <br><br>Or a powerful mage appears in a thunderclap and tells us that she has rewards beyond imagination for all, but we must prove ourselves worthy first and proceeds to send us on a quest. Even better, she hires us to accompany her at 10pp a day plus whatever loot we can carry and then we all go on the quest together. It wouldn't be too difficult to hide quests of this sort so that they could only be started with the pass-phrase given by the GM. Heck, most people have a hard enough time finding real EQ quests without searching one of the fine web sites like Allakhazam (worth every cent of the premium fee, by the way) or shouting to an entire zone to find out what a Sarnak War Braid is used for...<br><br>Now maybe if the events were *always* going on, they wouldn't have quite the draw that they normally do and behaviors would change. I hope that's the case for Legends servers, because I'd be pretty ticked off to pay extra for the dubious privilege of living in a constant GM event atmosphere as it exists on Zebuxoruk<br><br>I've read the interviews about Legends and I don't doubt that $40/month is indeed the magic number that Verant needs to charge to run the servers, pay for bandwidth, pay salaries, make Legends a self-sufficient cost/profit center. But it's about $20-25 more than I'm willing to pay.<br><br>Perhaps it's my loss. Perhaps I'm not hardcore enough. But so be it - for now, I'll stay on Zebuxoruk and wreak my havoc and terror there. There may never be a spell named &quot;Ynar's Acid Tongue,&quot; but heck... enough people on Zebux already know that Ynar has an acid tongue!<br><br><br>APPENDIX<br><br>Ok, I just finished reading another interview about the legends server, this time with one of the GMs. It appears that many of my concerns are actually being addressed on the Legends server (and I can count on one hand the number of times that Verant and I actually thought similarly on an issue).<br><br>There are two quotes of note:<br><br>Q: How will you prevent people flocking to zones for quest loot?<br><br>A: One of the things you will see is a change in Focus whereby not all quests will be obvious and large-scale. Many will be small group based quests that will not get the attention of entire guilds of people.<br><br><br>Very nice! This is exactly what I was talking about. And:<br><br><br>Q: Will GM's contact me when events are on?<br><br>A: Not directly no. But if you are in a group don't be surprised if one day some strange NPC comes up and starts interacting with your party. You can then choose to participate or not.<br><br><br>It's almost like they were reading my mind. Now if only they could drop the price by $15-20, I'd be hard-pressed not to upgrade. Ultimately, though, I don't play enough to slog through trying to level another necromancer. I've been playing since last June and have only reached 33 with Ynar (34 any day now). And I'd hate to transfer Ynar because I've made so many great friends. So maybe someday I'll move to legends.<br><br>But not today.<br><br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Feb 25 22:37:57 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>-- Bene Moriore</td></tr>

I had originally planned for a more role-play oriented character journal for my primary (Ynar, Level 31 Necromancer on Zebuxoruk). I'd always wanted to try my hand at some fiction writing, and this seemed like an easy introduction.<br><br>However, I find myself being more interested in talking about the Everquest experience than in documenting what Ynar does in-game. More than likely, you play the game too, and have seen much of what I would describe.<br><br>Instead, today I'll recount my recent departure from and subsequent return to Norrath.<br><br>It all happened around Halloween. The GM events were in full force and I, like so many others, was rabidly in pursuit of nice goodies. This was the beginning of the end. I saw greed turn so many (ordinarily nice) people into lewt-grubbing jerks, that the events stopped being fun.<br><br>Then they just wouldn't stop! I expected maybe a day or two... but a week? I started cheering for the people who were going after the NPCs that would end an event. I sympathized with the people who didn't get that special trinket (I never did get that nice cloak), but I was ready to get back to normal EQ life. I was in the middle of my first hell level, and getting experience was next to impossible with most people swarming the event zones all the time.<br><br>Then came *the patch.* If you've read my first journal entry, you already know how I feel about the coin drop issue and there's no point in recounting it here. Suffice to say, however, that this was more or less the final straw. I was officially burned out.<br><br>I rediscovered real life. I watched TV. I got remotivated on some particularly dull projects at work. I traveled and visited family without wishing I was playing EQ. It was refreshing.<br><br>Just after Thanksgiving, I got an email from the folks at Anarchy Online. I had purchased the game in the summer, but cancelled my account because it was just too buggy and slow. The email said that they had made lots of improvements and invited me to try the game again for another 30 days at no charge. This is the kind of customer service and attention that I wish Verant would exhibit more often.<br><br>So I played AO for a few weeks. Not nearly as hard as I had played EQ, but I enjoyed the experience. Ultimately, I just didn't get into AO as much as EQ, but I think it's definitely a viable game now. I didn't continue my account at the end of the trial period, though.<br><br>During the holiday break I tried logging back into EQ a couple of times, but just never felt like doing anything. I was afraid that my burnout was permanent.<br><br>But one day a few weeks ago, out of the blue - I felt like playing. Maybe I just needed some time to decompress - I'm certainly not as serious as I used to be about the game, and if I miss a night of playing, I don't begrudge whatever it is that I'm doing instead. <br><br>I wish I could level more quickly, but Verant seems intent to keep the game artificially long, so I'm not as worried about it as I used to be. I'm still ticked off about the coin dropping thing, though.<br><br>Ultimately, I enjoy EQ a lot. It's a wonderful world to explore, and that's what I'm doing more of these days. Now I'm more interested in leveling up so I can see some of the zones I've never been to. I do have to admit, however, that it's a really nice, somewhat guilty pleasure to go back and stomp on some NPC or Mob that made your life a living hell in the early days (Phaeril Nightshire, I'm looking in your direction). I'm currently exploring the Ocean of Tears. It's an interesting zone, and I'm one skill point away from being a master swimmer.<br><br>So while this isn't new or earth shattering advice - take a break every now and then. You'll end up appreciating the game even more!</p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>-- Bene Moriore</td></tr>

I applaud them for this.<br><br>The TLC was a reaction to a problem that can definitely be frustrating for many young characters - farming by high levels in low level zones. Unfortunately, the solution provided was indicative of a fundamental disagreement I've developed with Verant's game administration philosophy: a seemingly arbitrary and arrogant willingness to limit the enjoyment of a majority of its customers based on the preferences of its game design staff.<br><br>In a nutshell, my argument is this: It is not Verant's place to tell me how I will best enjoy the game.<br><br>Now don't get me wrong, this is Verant's product, and they are free to make it behave in any manner they see fit. But please don't try to tell me that it's "more realistic" that the Kobold King in The Warrens would magically not be carrying an item simply because he was killed by a stronger person... Verant continued to try and justify the TLC by saying that "a real high level character wouldn't have time to do these things himself and would get lower level characters to do menial tasks." This is exactly the kind of attitude that makes me the most angry.<br><br>My character doesn't *trust* underlings to do the job. (And on a side note, I enjoy collecting my own bone chips... sometimes you need a break from the adventure). But with TLC, Verant was *forcing* me into a role that I didn't want to play.<br><br>But happily, Verant has decided to do away with TLC because it was so overwhelmingly disliked.<br><br>Unfortunately, Verant has given with the right hand and taken with the left, because in the very same patch, we lost the ability to drop coin.<br><br>This is ludicrous. Once again, Verant has chosen the most heavy-handed method possible to address a relatively minor problem - the potential for new characters to be scammed into dropping their coin.<br><br>Now the easiest and least intrusive solution to this problem would have been for Verant to simply add the confirmation dialog box present when you try to drop an item on the ground. Instead, because they "couldn't see any valid reason" to drop coin, they removed the ability entirely.<br><br>Instead of providing us with an option, they forced a behavior on us. I am no longer able to anonymously drop coin in newbie gardens. As a player, I like to help other characters. As a Necromancer, it isn't in my character to give coin to a halfling. Now I have to make a choice... either compromise my character and come up with some rationalization to fit Verant's preference, or just not help other players any more.<br><br>Then there is the whole twinking issue. Now I don't really twink my alternate characters, but to be honest, I hate the process of getting from level 1 to the mid-teens. I've done it once, and I don't really have any desire to do it again. More to the point, it's not Verant's place to tell me that I *should* enjoy it. Before the coin drop nerf, if I wanted to play through those levels, I could, and if I didn't want to, well it wasn't difficult to provide some coin to the new toon to get past those levels as quickly as possible.<br><br>(Yes, I can still trade coin between toons by using a 3rd party, but I either risk the coin with someone I don't know, or inconvienence one of my friends).<br><br>Verant's additional justification was that they were having a great deal of customer support traffic with people who had inadvertantly dropped coin and wanted it back, in spite of the stated policy that a GM *will not* restore coin or items.<br><br>I say that they'll just trade one support issue for another as people who lose coin in bad twinking decisions make exactly the same petitions.<br><br>It's my belief that Verant wanted to make twinking more difficult and found a way to do it without looking like they were doing it directly. It's pretty obvious, however, that they went out of their way to avoid the obvious solution that would have the least impact on people (confirmation box) and went with the ham-fisted "you will do what we want" approach that is becoming increasingly less tolerable with each new instance.<br><br>Verant has done an amazing job creating a fabulous world that I am absolutely hooked on. But it has developed an attitude that it can tell me how I'll best enjoy the game, and I don't appreciate that one bit. For a long time, it has been able to force that attitude on its customer base because it was far and away the best MMORPG in the world. That's going to change in the next year or two, and Verant needs to reevaluate its position or risk&nbsp;&nbsp;alienating its customer base.<br><br>Verant, you can tell me the rules of the world you've created, you can even change the rules on a whim, but please quit trying to rationalize your preferences by telling me that I will enjoy the game more with your new restrictions. You don't know how I most enjoy the game.<br><br>Twinking and leaving coins for other players didn't hurt anyone else, and most likely caused the people doing those things to enjoy themselves. Removing coin dropping annoys most of us and makes the game less enjoyable.</p>&nbsp;<br><span class=sm>----------------------------</span><br>-- Bene Moriore</td></tr>
