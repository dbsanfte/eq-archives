        DKP, or Dragon Kill Points, are earned by attending raids and helping 
        to kill various mobs. Each Mob we kill has an assigned point value. If 
        you are there when we kill the mob you will earn that amount of points. 
        If it is the first time the guild kills that mob, you will earn double 
        points. There are also a few instances where you may earn points even 
        if the raid fails. Not everything we kill will have a point value.</p>
      <p align="justify"><em>Example: We head into Fear and kill Cazic Thule. 
        He has a point value of 10. Each member there who helps kill him will 
        receive 10 points. If it was the first time the guild killed him you will 
        receive 20 points, double his worth.</em></p>
      <p align="justify"><strong><font size="4">Earning IDKP</font><br>
        </strong>IDKP, or Incentive DKP, is earned by such things as arriving 
        at the called raid site within a set amount of time, helping other members 
        with quests, scouting for mobs, and so on. IDKP will be a separate total 
        from DKP and is used in tie-breakers. IDKP is temporary and resets to 
        Zero on a monthly basis. </p>
      <p>Example: A raid on ToV is called. If you get to ToV within 15 minutes 
        of when it is called you receive an IDKP point. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong><font size="4">Using DKP &amp; IDKP</font></strong><br>
        When we are on a raid and an item drops, That item will be assigned a 
        point value. People will then be able to send a tell to say that they 
        want it. Whoever has the most DKP of the people who sent a tell will be 
        awarded the item and have the value of the item subtracted from their 
        DKP total. If two or more people have the same amount of DKP, then their 
        IDKP total will be used as a tie breaker. If both have the same IDKP total 
        then they will do a random roll of numbers set by an officer, highest 
        rolled number wins.</p>
      <p><em>Example: We kill Vindi and he drops his BP. It is assigned a value 
        of 5 points. Warrior1 has 15 DKP and warrior2 has 10DKP. Warrior1 Wins 
        the BP.</em></p>
      <p><em>Example: Vindi BP drops. Warrior1 and Warrior2 both have 15 DKP, 
        but Warrior1 has 7 IDKP and Warrior2 has 10 IDKP. Since Warrior2 has more 
        IDKP, he wins the BP.</em> </p>
      <p>Other DKP Rules and Answers to Possible Questions:</p>
      <p>All current members will start at zero DKP. New members will start at 
        zero DKP.</p>
      <p>Recruits do not earn DKP until they become a full member. They may however 
        be allowed to loot a rotting item if an officer permits it.</p>
      <p>Honorary members, such as non-guild members who raid with us alot, can 
        earn DKP.</p>
      <p align="justify">You can go into negative DKP. Meaning if you have 10DKP 
        and the item is worth 15, you can use your DKP and go to &#8211;5. You 
        must then wait until you have positive DKP to try to win more items.</p>
      <p align="justify">2-3 boxing: If you 2 or 3 box, all of your chars will 
        receive equal DKP if they are considered to be valuable to, or needed, 
        to make a raid successful and they meet current recruitment standards. 
        Such as Truking/Leanora or Terrorus/Figgy/Anna. If you bring a lower level 
        alt to a raid it will not receive DKP. IF you want your alt to get loot 
        you must spend you own DKP and can only do so if no other members need 
        the item.</p>
      <p align="justify">If you loot an item, it will cost you its assigned DKP 
        value. There are NO exceptions to this rule. It doesn&#8217;t matter if 
        it&#8217;s going to rot or if no one else wants it. IF you don&#8217;t 
        want to spend the DKP, then let it rot.</p>
      <p>There will be NO transferring points between your characters, or to other 
        guild members.</p>
      <p>Some items will still be merit, such as ST keys.</p>
      <p>Item values will be assigned as they drop. The same item may not always 
        be worth the same amount of points each time, but we will try to be consistent. 
      </p>
      <p>Loot can be returned to the guild for DKP. The amount of DKP will be 
        less then what you paid for it. This is to encourage you to give it back 
        so it can be handed down and further enhance the guild as a whole.</p>
      <p>There is no max DKP total you can have, and it will not be reset unless 
        you leave the guild or are away for an extended period of time. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>These are the rules. There will be NO exceptions. 
        Period. <br>
