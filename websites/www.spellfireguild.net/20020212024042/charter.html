<h1><center>CHARTER</center></h1><p>

<p><b>***Short and Sweet***</b> (Please read the paragraph down below for full rules and regs)
<p>1. Be honorable and polite
<p>2. Keep interactions PG-13. (occasional damn or such, nothing more) This may be an adult game,
   but many minors play, and as such lets work not to be a bad influence.
<p>3. We seek to operate in a friendly manner; thus, no guild wars.
<p>4. While we will not say you CAN'T go /anon, we prefer if you stay in /role if you feel the need 
   to hide your class/level. This helps if an impromtu raid idea or something important comes up.. 
   as well as showing others our strength.<br>
<p>5. We do not allow arguing in guild chat. Anyone violating this will be warned a maximum number of 
   2 times before being removed. Anything of a controversial nature should be taken to tells or to the
   message boards to work out.

<p>*****If for some reason you feel the need to sling dirt, or bash, or make a public spectacle of 
     yourself (bad), we ask that you remove the guild tag from over your head before doing so. 
     This saves us thehassle of traveling all over to do it for you ;). Our reputation is 
     important, and as such anyone acting in a way that will make us (as a guild) seem dishonorable
     or rude shall be removed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><big>CHARTER</b></big><p>
     Spellfire has a leadership based on democracy for all members. Our goal is to provide a supportive atmosphere by upholding the rules and honor throughout Norrath as well as assisting any that may be in need of our help. All members must be willing to promote growth for the guild, as well as promoting honor and a code of ethics amongst ourselves and those with whom we interact in our journeys across Norrath. To be a part of Spellfire is to strive to be the best in all aspects of the game. May all that know us think of us as honorable and view us with respect.
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Governing Body:</b></u><p>
     Spellfire's ruling body is made up of the following positions of power. By agreeing to join this guild, you agree to adhere to the decisions, and requirements set forth by the current governing members of the guild.
<br>
<p>      <b>Leader:</b> The leader of the guild has the main responsibility of maintaining the guild, arbitrating resolutions to conflicts when not resolved by the council, and making the final decisions on the basis of what's best for the guild when there is a need for immediate resolution of a situation. The main focus of this position is to maintain internal and external relations among our members and with other guilds.
<br>      
<p>      <b>Assistant Leader/Senior Council Member:</b> The assistant leader serves as a replacement for, and speaks on behalf of the leader in his/her absence, as though the words were the leaders own, and is appointed by the guild leader. The main focus of the acting leader is to help the leader fulfill his/her goals and duties to the guild in unavoidable absences. 
<br>
<p>      <b>Council Members:</b> The council members are the driving forces of the guilds day to day activities. The main focus of council members is to ensure all guild members have leadership support. They also maintain order and ensure all members follow the rules and code of conduct set forth by this charter, and to mediate any disputes involving a guild member when needed. 
<br>
<p>      <b>Advisors:</b> The Advisor title is awarded by council members to those who have performed beyond the average for the guild. No order of authority is established for an advisor, but they do have the right and the ability to maintain order and enforce the rules and code of ethics of the charter if no higher authority is online. Advisors also facilitate invites to join our guild.
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Punishement and Procedures:</u></b><p>
     Any instances that are considered in complete violation of the charter and can inhibit the betterment and growth of the guild will be noted in the guild log and an immediate review will be called by the council to discuss the action that the violation deserves. This can, and in most cases will, result in a probationary period being placed upon the violating member. The other option is immediate removal of the violating party. In an extreme case where a member completely violates the charter and code of conduct, the member may be immediately removed and may appeal to the council for review of the situation.
<p>
<b><u>Code of Conduct:</b></u><p>
      Conflicts of a personal nature between members of the guild should be taken to tells to resolve. Guildsay should not be used as a source for settling things. If you are unable to resolve the conflict between yourselves, then you should seek the assistance of a council member or an advisor. If the conflict is between council members or advisors, then the matter should be taken to the next highest level in the chain of command to help with the issue.
<br>      All members of the guild have the same rights regardless of class, level, or status within the guild. Any acts of discrimination will be dealt with harshly.
<br>      It is requested that you take everyone's feelings into consideration in regards to language used anywhere other than tells. There are many minors that play this game and as such please be aware that your language and attitudes can be inappropriate to those you are dealing with. If we all keep a PG-13 attitude and language rule this will go easier (this means the occasional "damn" or to that effect nothing more). Please remember that we appreciate all members and developing a good report and trust amongst members will help ensure our continued success and growth.
<br>      No member is allowed to participate in "guild bashing" in any form. If you have a problem with a member or members in another guild, refrain from generalizing an entire guild based on the actions of an individual(s). Any problems of a serious nature should be brought to the attention of a council member so that we can facilitate an easy solution so there is no negative impact on our relations with said guild. This also applies to person to person interaction. That MUST be kept out of open channels as well. If you have a problem with a person take it to tells, if they can't live up to that, /ignore works well.
