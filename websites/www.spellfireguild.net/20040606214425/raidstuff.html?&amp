        All healers should be in this channel to watch for spot heal needs, as 
        well as watching for CH rotation to follow through. No heals other than 
        rotation should be announced in this chat so as not to confuse those doing 
        CH and/or watching for CH chain.</font> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

        <br>
        This channel is got ALL off tanks (warriors, knights, capably geared monks). 
        Announce any mezz tank targets in this chat so all other off tanks know 
        to go back to the MA. This is decrease confusion over what mobs are running 
        loose and who has control of those that aren't mezzable. Always use the 
        offtank hotkey in raid chat so healers (non rotation) know whom to heal 
        at the time. <br>

        This is a non raid time channel, but we all need to be in it. This is 
        a communication channel for our recruits so that they may know about guild 
        events, get to know members, get groups with us, and secure sponsors (for 
        those that don't already have). <br>

        Now other raid rules and needs: <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Control Push</font><br>
        <br>
        I say this about 100x per raid, but I figure since I have to say it so 
        much maybe our normal raid crew doesn't understand how or why we need 
        to do this. </font> 
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        Surrounding the mob is the key to controlling push. To place yourself 
        in a circle (or semi circle for walled mobs) use f9 and place yourself 
        in open spots at MAX MELEE (i'll describe this further down) around the 
        mob. Usually plate classes should be around the front (don't be scared 
        of a little riposte), rogues and ONLY rogues on the rear, and leather 
        on the sides. Monks have a lot of push so position on each side accordingly. 
        Rogues also have a lot of push but this is balanced by the plate in the 
        front. If the mob seems to be moving in one direction or the other, situate 
        yourself in a better spot to help prevent this. The MA WILL flip mobs 
        at times. Move with them and help them keep it positioned. </font> 
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        Controlling push is essential because we can end up aggroing unnecessary 
        mobs, and in some cases it can cause a wipe really quickly. </font>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp; 
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"> Max Melee</font><br>
        <br>
        A major part of push control is also attacking at MAX melee. This means 
        that u stand as far back from the mob as possible without getting the 
        "too far away" message. This helps diminish push so that the mob stays 
        where the MA wants it. This also keeps Crankie from whining because he's 
        boxed in and can't move with the mob. </font>
       <p>&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
        everyone makes an effort to do these things, raids will go much smoother 
        and have less mishaps. I dunno about you guys, but the less I die the 
        happier I am at the end of the night. And also the less we die the faster 
        we accomplish the goal and move on to other targets. </font> 
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        I've been very proud of us the past few days and I want us to continue 
        forward. Let's work together to accomplish it ! </font></td>
