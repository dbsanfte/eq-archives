        is a guild founded with the concept that as a team anything is possible. 
        We are dedicated to excersizing our abilities to obtain the highest possible 
        level of play. We require every member to act as a part of the team in 
        order to obtain our goals.<br>

        The leaders of the guild are responsible for the primary functions of

        help support and obtain our goals.</font></h5>

        The officers of the guild form a panel of people who act as a support 
        team for the leaders and handle the day to day operation of the guild. 
        Officers have as much authority as the leaders and should be treated as 
        such.</font></h5>

        The members are the core of the guild. As such, it is the responsibility 
        of every member to uphold the reputation of the guild. It is also the 
        members responsibility to act as a part of the team and do whatever is 
        possible to help us reach and maintain a higher level and standard of 
        play. </font></h5>

        <font size="3">Expectations:</font><br>
        Spellfire is a raiding guild. Our expectation of every member is that they work to help us become more capable of conquering more mobs/zones in Norrath. As such, we expect members to attend as many raids as possible during online time. We also expect every member to listen and follow the directions of the raid leaders and officers.</font></h5>
<p><br>
<h5 align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <font size="3">Guild Chat:</font><br>
        There is currently no censorship on guild chat or raid chats. We expect each member to show their respect for the diversity of the people in the guild by maintaining an awareness of what may or may not be offensive. In the case of someone taking offense to something said, an officer will contact the person having made the offensive comment or gesture and will explain the situation and ask that any such mention be refrained from in open channels from then on. We will only impose restrictions on guild chat as complaints are lodged, so please show maturity in what you say/imply in guild/raid chat. Also keep in mind that what may seem like a joke to you, may very well be highly offensive to someone else.</font></h5>
<p><br>
<h5 align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <font size="3">Loot:</font><br>
        While we utilize a point system to award loot in the majority of cases, some loot will still be awarded via merit. In these cases, any droppable loot awarded to a member will be returned to the guild should the member leave the guild (whether on good terms or bad). This has always been a standing rule and has worked well for us as a whole.</font></h5>
<p><br>
<h5 align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <font size="3">Information:</font><br>
        No member of the guild at any time should exchange strategies for how we kill mobs with any person outside the guild. When information is shared it promotes guilds unable to do things and gives them the information needed to conquer something previously unattainable. This adds to competition for spawns and interference from other guilds on our tier. Also, please do not disclose any information regarding spawn times and our frequency in raiding specific places.<p><br> *** Exceptions to this are officers trading strats for other strats.***</font></h5>
