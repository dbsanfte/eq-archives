<h1><center>Recruit Rules</h1></center>
<b>The following guildelines will be used when determining future member invites:</b><p>

      All new recruits must be known by at least two members of the guild or become known to members via grouping or joining us on raids.<p>

      Once the first requirement is filled, a recruit must acquire a sponsor. A sponsor can be any member in good standing (no warnings on record). The sponsor must then make a poll in the member recruit section of the message boards with name class and level as the subject. A person must obtain 10 "yes" votes and no "no" votes (no votes are not counted if there is no explanation for the no) in order to be issued an invite. A recruit may also obtain "online votes" which must number 7 or more and have the approval of 2 officers.<p>
      The new member is then required to visit the web page and register on the message boards and post on the members list with a minimum of name/class/level information of the character that has been invited.<p>
      All members are on a probationary term on invitation and will remain so for one (1) RL month. During this time if a new member acts against the charter or violates the rules or acts in a way that is discrediting to the guild they will be removed with little or no warning. This also allows the recruit to decide whether he/she is able to fit into our family. During this time any issues that arrise can be dealt with as well.<p>
      Minimum requirement for guild invitations is level 50, though we will make exceptions <i>occasionally</i>. <p>
      Officers are responsible for informing each new member they invite of necessary information such as web page address and any other information needed.<p>
      You may have as many characters as you like within the guild, but no more than 3 of them shall be under level 30 unless you have specific permission from the council. This prevents folks from staying at the same level as when invited, thus falling behind the range of the rest of the guild.<p>
      All members who are below level 40 agree to willingly stay anonymous or in role-playing mode at ALL times. Once reaching level 30 members are asked to use role-playing mode if they do not want to show class/level.<p>
      Any character who has either been removed from the guild, or has left the guild of their own desire MUST appear before, or have their case brought before, a council member panel containing a minimum of 6 council members. The circumstances will be reviewed at that time and a decision will be rendered on the issue. As a general rule it is greatly looked down upon to leave the guild without a seriously good reason.
