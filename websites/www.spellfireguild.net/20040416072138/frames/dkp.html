        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">DKP, or Dragon Kill Points, are earned by attending raids and helping 
        to kill various mobs.&nbsp; Each Mob we kill has an assigned point value.&nbsp; If 
        you are there when we kill the mob you will earn that amount of points.&nbsp; If it is the first time the guild kills that mob, you will earn double 
        points.&nbsp; There are also a few instances where you may earn points even 
        if the raid fails.&nbsp; Not everything we kill will have a point value.</font></p>

        receive 20 points.)</em></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When we are on a raid and an item drops, 
      that item will be assigned a 
        point value.&nbsp; People will then be able to send a tell to say that they 
        want it.&nbsp; The person with the highest DKP total will be 
        awarded the item. The DKP value of the item will then be subtracted from their 
        DKP total.&nbsp; If two or more people have the same amount of DKP, then the 
        officers present will merit the item.
<br>
<br>
When making loot decisions, the officers will use the totals as they appear in the DKP tool at the time of the raid.
Until the raid is entered into the tool, you do not have the DKP from that raid.  Every effort will be made to enter 
raids into the DKP tool on a nightly basis.  The only time the totals in the tool will not be used is when a player 
has looted something earlier in the day.  The amount of DKP spent will be taken into consideration when making loot 
decisions later in the same day.

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Characters that have not attended a raid in 45 days are 
	automatically marked "inactive" in the DKP tool.  You may not spend DKP while your character is inactive 
	unless yours is the only tell on the item.  When a character has been inactive for 30 days, 10% of their DKP 
	total is deducted.  Each 30 day period that passes will result in an additional 10% reduction of their DKP total.  
	This cycle will continue until the character becomes active or their DKP total reaches 0.  To return to "active" status, the character must attend 10 DKP events within a 45 day period.<br>
<br>
	If you remove yourself from the guild for any reason, the following DKP penalty will be applied:<br>
At the officers discretion, an immediate penalty may be applied to your DKP total.<br>
After 3 days, 25% of your DKP total will be removed.<br>
After 10 days, 50% of your DKP total will be removed.<br>
After 20 days, your DKP total will be set to 0 and your status will be changed to "recruit".<br>
<br>
DKP can and will be docked for skipping raids. If you cannot attend a raid, it is YOUR responsibility 
	to inform an officer.  If you are online during a raid and do not attend, you will be docked if you 
	have not cleared it with an officer.  The amount of DKP docked for skipping a raid will be 3x the normal 
	amount of DKP for that mob.  DKP will also be used for other forms of punishment when necessary to restore order.

      <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Recruits will not gain DKP until they are tagged. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">New members will start at 
        zero DKP.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Honorary members, such as non-guild members who raid with us alot, can 
        earn DKP.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You can go into negative DKP.&nbsp; Meaning if you have 10DKP 
        and the item is worth 15, you can use your DKP and go to &#8211;5.&nbsp; You 
        must then wait until you have positive DKP to try to win more items.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">2-3 boxing: If you 2 or 3 box, all of your chars will 
        receive equal DKP if they are considered to be valuable to, or needed, 
        to make a raid successful and they meet current recruitment standards.&nbsp; If you bring a lower level 
        alt to a raid it will not receive DKP.&nbsp; Alternate characters may be considered 2nd main characters, but will only receive DKP if the character is played well.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you loot an item, it will cost you its assigned DKP 
        value.&nbsp; There are NO exceptions to this rule.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t matter if 
        it&#8217;s going to rot or if no one else wants it.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t 
        want to spend the DKP, then let it rot.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There will be NO transferring points between your characters, or to other 
        guild members.&nbsp; (Exception: If you retire a character, you may 
      transfer the points to another NEW main if it's replacing the old one and has not earned DKP previously, but cannot go back and forth 
      between the two.)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some items will still be merit, such as ST keys, spells/runes, etc. Also, items that the guild leadership feels should be merited to the MA chain such as Bloodfrenzy and Blade of Carnage will be merited to the appropriate individual by the officers. BoC and certain other droppable items remain the property of the guild, and must be returned to the guild bank when the holder decides to move on for whatever reason. These items are identified as such at the time of drop, and include but are not limited to the Blade of Carnage and Helm of Rallos Zek.
</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Item values will be assigned as they drop.&nbsp; The same item may not always 
        be worth the same amount of points each time, but we will try to be consistent.&nbsp; If an item changes in value, we will base that upon what items of similar or better stats we are currently capable of obtaining and the value of that item to the member's advancement.
      </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Droppable loot that was obtained from the guild can be returned to the guild for DKP.&nbsp; The amount of DKP refunded will be 
        the current DKP price of the item at the time it is returned.&nbsp; This is to encourage you to give it back 
        so it can be handed down and further enhance the guild as a whole.</font></p>
