  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Woohoo another asshole down! We've decided to play a bit more in
  PoP now, and we're enjoying it! After much fun learning the strat and beating the hell out of cats, Mith Marr 
  fell. What kinda ass has cats guarding him anyway?</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Aten Ha Ra and her minions fall!</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We all pile into VT and what do we 
     see? Aten and her friends poking fun at us. So we decided to show them that 
     we were bigger and better. And we did! VT has to be the most unimaginative 
     and monotonous zone in game (well except that AHR has fully rendered breasts
     of course!) and after hours of clearing and a large sacrifice of sleep from
     everyone involved, TVK, DXVT, KTAHR, Aten JR, and AHR were taken down. 
 Excellent work from everyone involved!</font></p>
