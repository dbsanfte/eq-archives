          raiding guild. Our expectation of every member is that they work to 
          help us become more capable of conquering more mobs/zones in Norrath. 
          As such, we expect members to attend as many raids as possible during 
          online time. All raids are mandatory unless skipping is cleared by an officer. If you need a night off, need some time with friends, need some xp, whatever be the case, let an officer know when you or they log in so that we may know to exclude you from the head count when we call a raid. We also expect every member to listen and follow the 
          directions of the raid leaders and officers.</font></p>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">There is 
          currently no censorship on guild chat or raid chats. We expect each 
          member to show their respect for the diversity of the people in the 
          guild by maintaining an awareness of what may or may not be offensive. 
          In the case of someone taking offense to something said, an officer 
          will contact the person having made the offensive comment or gesture 
          and will explain the situation and ask that any such mention be 
          refrained from in open channels from then on. We will only impose 
          restrictions on guild chat as complaints are lodged, so please show 
          maturity in what you say/imply in guild/raid chat. Also keep in mind 
          that what may seem like a joke to you, may very well be highly 
          offensive to someone else.</font></p>

          loot will still be awarded via merit. In these cases, any droppable 
          loot awarded to a member will be returned to the guild should the 
          member leave the guild (whether on good terms or bad). This has always

          mobs with any person outside the guild. When information is shared it 
          promotes guilds unable to do things and gives them the information 
          needed to conquer something previously unattainable. This adds to 
          competition for spawns and interference from other guilds on our tier. 
          Also, please do not disclose any information regarding spawn times and
