<P>Boy what a week it was. Wednesday, Noble House and Vanquished Souls took down Nagafen 
for the first time.  Loot consisted of a Gold Plated Koshigatana, Gauntlets of Fiery Might, 
Orb of Tishan, and a Tooth.  Friday we struck down Nagafen again.  Loot consisted of 
Heirophant's Crook, Blight, Hammer of the Scourge, and three Bags.

<br>
Saturday was another big day for Noble House and Vanquished Souls.  We had a great loot drop in 
fear and we killed the Dracholiche with ease, dropping some Necro staff.  As we continued to mow 
through the mobs with the help of Snaggle's experience and sacrifice, Only Cazic-Thule remained.
We buffed up and Vladimyr(sp?) from Vanquished Souls lead the charge and took the honorary Death 
Touch (Thanks bud!:) Cazic fell quickly and we were rewarded Bloodfire, Amulet of Necropotence, 
and a Darkwooden Box.  Way to go and congrats!!
