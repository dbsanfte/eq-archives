It was a very busy weekend for Noble House.  We raided City of Mist a few times and recieved five Ornate Rune Shields (Mystral, Thorlax, Taben, Daelome, ?), two Throneblades (Valor, ?) and a ton of quest items.  We visited Chardok on Saturday to slay the elusive king with no luck.  Got him down to a sliver of health, he Complete Healed, got him down to a quarter life and we failed.  Sunday we visited Hole and slayed Master Yael and he turned up two Serpents Tooth's (Geaden, NH Vault) and recieved a ton of Epic Quest items through out the day.  Monday, a early group of NH reserved the Warlord/Hand room in Karnors and got Seji his pipe from the Pawbuster.  Seji recieved the Robe of the Whistling Fist.  Congratulations!!
