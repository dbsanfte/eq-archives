QUEST AT A GLANCE <br />
1. The first part entails gathering 10 different shards from all over luclin.<br />
2. For the second part, you will need to obtain a Scepter Frame and combine the 10 shards to reassemble the Scepter. This Scepter is now a 2 slot container. <br />
3. The third part will require the killing of the Emperor and looting a Staff. This Staff has 2 charges of Summon a Shaded Sphere. Zaar of Triton confirmed it with : Yea 2x charges of 20 power source, so 40. <br />
4. The fourth part is the re-energizing of the Scepter by combining the Orb of Luclinite and the summoned Shaded Sphere in the reassembled Scepter.<br />
5. Enjoy your key as the final product is the Scepter of Shadows aka Vex Thal Key - Item 22198 in Magelo.<br />
6. Use key to enter Vex Thal  ======&gt; spell effect is not relevant.<br />
<br />
LIST AND LOCATIONS OF ITEMS NEEDED <br />
Shards<br />
<br />
Please note that the Maiden Eye shard seems to be the most elusive to obtain.  It drops from a few different Gorangas but seems to require heavy camping.  Sorry! Let's hope that the May 8th patch may answer our prayers for many, many drops.  Indeed, the drops have been increased in ME.  Thanks! <br />
<br />
Shard 1: The Grey - Kel - 22185 - Boulder, Sun Revenants<br />
Shard 2: FG - Dat - 22186 - Shik'Nar Warrior, Soldier, Royal and possibly Forager<br />
Shard 3: Scarlet Desert - Set - 22187 - Sun Revenants and Sun Reavers.<br />
Shard 4: The Deep - Raf - 22188 - Thought Leeches or Thought Horrors<br />
Shard 5:Ssra - Vin - 22189 - Skeletal Drudge and a few more random mobs <br />
Shard 6:Akheva - Dax - 22190 - Xi Vius or Shadow Reavers - Roudy Rubble - Shade Golem<br />
Shard 7      : Dawnshroud - Lor - 22191 - Rockhoppers - Sambata<br />
Shard 8: Maiden Eye - Tak - 22192 - Goranga Forager, Gatherer, Hunter, Prophet, Seer <br />
Shard 9:Acrylia - Ved - 22193 - Grimling Skullcrackers<br />
Shard 10:Sanctus Seru - Kelara - 22194 - A Legionneer of the Hand at Marus Seru zone<br />
<br />
Other Items and Containers <br />
Summoned from Emperor Staff: Shaded Sphere - 22195<br />
Glowing Orb of Luclinite - 22196<br />
Sceptre of Akelha Ra FRAME - 17323.<br />
<br />
The first container you will need is the Sceptre of Akelha Ra FRAME. It is a 10 slot container than holds only tiny items. It is originally called the Shadowed Scepter Frame.  The reassembled Scepter is a 2 slot container that will be used to combine the Sphere and Orb. <br />
<br />
Vex Thal Key <br />
The Scepter of Shadows - Item 22198<br />
<br />
A FEW DETAILS, QUOTES AND DIALOGUES<br />
This has been copied from several posts and consolidated. Again, credit goes to original posters.<br />
<br />
GETTING THE SCEPTER IN AKHEVA...<br />
<br />
Getting ready for the dialogues...<br />
Head to Akheva. From the zone in, run straight, past the fallen pillar. When you get to the next room, head right. Going left will take you to Va'Dyn. Go down the next set of stairs. To your right is IV. Go left, you will see a large &quot;gate&quot; with two &quot;shades&quot; standing on the left and right edges of this gate.<br />
<br />
Pull the far right shade, it will bring 2 mobs. Clear them, then move in hugging the right side. Cross directly over the open area and kill the alien midget mob that is by a set of stairs. Then run up those stairs where you will fight 3 alien mobs that have 4 arms each. They only hit for ~160s and can be slowed. Be sure to root the last one. Sometimes they will drop a &quot;Ans Xundrau xi Tekar&quot; 13/25 3 to all stats dagger, melee and caster only.<br />
<br />
At this point, you can drop down from the stairs and you will see a number of green con &quot;Sacrificed Remains&quot; and a &quot;Shimmering Presence.&quot; <br />
<br />
From there you will need items from a mage and a necro to continue the script. <br />
<br />
Dialogues and actions...<br />
A shimmering presence's voice invades your mind. <br />
'Shadows can not exist without light. Bring me a wisp stone so that my balance can be righted by their soft glow. <br />
<br />
This points to a MAGICIAN SPELL: <br />
Name: Summon Wisp <br />
Level: 4 <br />
Type: Summon a No-Rent Miscellaneous Object <br />
Actual Effects: Summons Wisp <br />
Description: This will summon a &quot;wisp stone&quot; that acts as a light source when worn for those who cannot see well at nighttime.<br />
<br />
Give the summoned Wisp stone and Spirit of Akelha `Ra will spawn. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, The Spirit of Akelha`Ra'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra 's hollow eyes look up at you. You have the distinct impression that she can see right into the darkest shadows of your soul. She opens her mouth to speak but the sounds you hear come from inside your mind. 'Greetings mortal, thank you for releasing me from my [tormented prison]. <br />
You say, 'what tormented prison'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra appears to be fading in and out of existence as you speak to her. The spirit's voice fills your mind. 'I am Akelha`Ra, once high priestess of Luclin and leader of the Akheva. This form you see before you now is a fading remnant of my former existence. The storm was the cause of my imprisonment in the world of undying [spirits]. <br />
<br />
You say, 'what spirit'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'We Akheva are immortal entities placed in this plane by the mistrees of shadow. We are her most perfect creation. Death has no meaning to us, as even in death we find rebirth through the power of the mistress. My imprisonment was caused by my seperation from the power of the mistress by [Atenha`Ra]. It was she who sent the storm to destroy me and all that followed me. '<br />
<br />
You say, 'who is atenha ra'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'It is more then a little ironic that Atenha`Ra is a reflection of myself. An entity created from my own consciousness, a reflection of a shadow. She now holds the seat of grand power in [Vex Thal], and I have not the power to gain entry to the city, let alone face her. You must find my scepter that was lost in the storm to gain entry to Vex Thal. The scepter has likely lost much of it's power from being shattered. Once it is reassembled you will need to merge a Orb of Luclinite with a source of celestial power inside the scepter. The spirits whisper that the emperor of the Shissar holds the power to manipulate such energy. Be weary of him, he is heralded as the slayer of gods, the defiler of realities. '<br />
<br />
You say, 'what Vex Thal'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'Vex Thal is the sacred home of the Akheva. The place where Luclin's power directly touches this world...ungh... I can not summon the frame of my scepter in my current weakened state. I need a soul to regain my pow...' As she speaks you can see her slowly fade out of existence. You wonder how long her spirit will stay with this world. She seems entirely unable to speak to you now, and can only muster the strength to point at the ground at Dimi 's feet. Dimi reaches down a picks up a small emerald off the ground, but it disappears silently into the shadows. Akelha`ra looks as if she is trying to speak again. '<br />
<br />
This points to a Emerald Essence.  Hand it in to collect the Scepter Frame that will allow to reassemble the Scepter.<br />
<br />
You say, 'what frame of your scepter'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra opens her mouth to speak, but the voice in your head is no longer audible. You reach forward to touch the fading shadow of a creature and draw back in horror as your hand disrupts the spirit before you. She evaporates into the shadows once more.<br />
<br />
Poof :( <br />

In the meantime, I hope that whomever worked so hard on the preliminary threads (Shard location, Akhevan language, etc) wont get too pissed at seeing a summary.</div></div><hr />

So supposing your shadow warding theorry is correct (something i dont believe) scepter would have one of the 5 shadowwardings and just 5 charges of it. That shadowwarding thing actually looks more like a RoF knocker or something to that effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I left it in the text because I quoted it directly from Zarin Dantarga (Siyni of Legacy of Sorrow). Later Siyni stated: Pardon me, what part of my post is incorrect? when someone challenged her information.  So, I left the text as originally posted. <br />
<br />
Also in the very beginning someone made a post about needing a necro to claim the artifact, albeit that sounded like a joke.<br />

Yea 2x charges of 20 power source, so 40.</div></div><hr />

So no one knows how many charges (if it does have charges) the key has.  I doubt it has any charges at all and its just a permanent key like VP or ST keys.<br />
<br />
The only confirmed charged item is the Scepter off Emporer.  It has 2 charges that summon a stack of 20 orbs.  So you can make 40 keys per Emporer kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*visions of activating this at some very populated locations* ...<br />
<br />
mmm ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Yiumlaien</div><div class="date">04-24-02, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...that everyone could theoretically make that key, the problem is just to CHARGE it... to charge the key u need that orb of luclinite and one of those 40 things summoned by the staff droped by the Emperor. If u charge it, then u have 5 charges of AE port to Vex Thal, means 5 Raids.<br />
<br />
That means one Emperor kill equals 40 times 5 Raids , thats 200 Raids to Vex Thal. After that u need to kill the Emperor again.<br />
<br />
That would also mean each guild &quot;just&quot; needs one key...<br />
<br />
That would also mean each guild not capable killing the Emperor would &quot;just&quot; have to BUY one of those 40 summoned things to get their key working 5 times = 5 Raids...<br />
<br />
Looks like a new way to get some money for the UBOR guilds )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_uruitia</div><div class="date">04-24-02, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am i missing something.... but where did this AE junk come in....<br />
<br />
When i spoke to Akhela'Ra, says that because the scepter was broken to recharge it to the way it once was before the shards had broken apart you would need to merge the orb and source.... lez repeat...<br />
<br />
b/c it was broken apart is why she said it needs to be recharged.  And im pretty sure if it was a PBAE VI would be very direct about it so ppl didnt mess up and port other ppl that didnt want too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Yiumlaien</div><div class="date">04-24-02, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the original post:<br />
<br />
At this time is SEEMS that the final Scepter will have this effect:<br />
Effect is Shadow Warding and can use 5 times.<br />
Shadow Warding 1~5<br />
Teleport to location 0,596 in vexthal<br />
Allowable Targets: Target Based AoE<br />
Range to Target: 200 feet<br />
Area Effect Range: 100 feet<br />
<br />
<br />
So there comes this &quot;junk&quot; from... just read carefully<br />
<br />
And i guess it works like a TL with a box where u can decline it if u dont want to join the raid... but im pretty sure that any guild who is about to do a VT Raid will choose a lonely place to start the raid to avoid other guilds to jump in...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Chukzombi</div><div class="date">04-24-02, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quest is spoiled, no need to waste everyone's time with useless conjecture.<br />
When Triton finishes the quest im sure you will see an update which will satisfy your curiosity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xiggin</div><div class="date">04-24-02, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quest is spoiled to a large extent.  It would still be nice to have 'conclusive&quot; evidence of all the steps.<br />
<br />
Working on one of those is like a game.  It is totally acceptable for people to post their ideas or speculation, good and bad. It is also acceptable for people &quot;in the know&quot; to give clues instead of the direct information. That is the way we always progress.<br />
<br />
In the end, I hope that people will have access to a finished and verified quest spoiler.  Then this board would have accomplished another very valuable step in making everyone EQ time more valuable.<br />
<br />
PS We still need the location of 10th shard. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_uruitia</div><div class="date">04-24-02, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in my own opinion, Akhela'Ra says your getting the source and orb to recharge it because it was broken not because it requires double A batterys of emp staff summons heh =p<br />
<br />
And if it was to req charges how would it be recharged from single item? run out of charges and do the key again? I know VI is a lil silly sometimes but not that silly<br />
<br />
How would they make it to have another shaded globe put another charge on it after the charges had been used?</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there's a few guilds (at least on my server) that would be stupid enough to try if they were able to buy the charges, but like I said, I don't see it happening, ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, think about it again:<br />
<br />
a guild who killed the emperor will definately kill him again , and that looong before they did 200 (!!!) raids on VT... so what to do with the other power sources? <br />
<br />
they wont be in VT all the time and i guess VT is more than big enough to keep a few raid partys...<br />
<br />
and i guess that hunting the &quot;normal&quot; mobs in VT is MUCH easier than killing the emp, so the fact that a guild is not able to kill the emp doesnt mean at all that it isnt able to kill stuff in VT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tyzman</div><div class="date">04-24-02, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I highly doubt any guild would sell charges...<br />
<br />
The obvious reason has already been mentioned...<br />
<br />
It makes no sense to help the competition get into Vex Thal.  Even if the zone can accommodate more then one guild (speculation), why would you want anyone else there if you could avoid it?  There is simply no reason to do so, regardless of the amount of pp offered.<br />
<br />
The better reason is...<br />
<br />
Why would anyone who spend countless hours farming keys and shissar bane weapons just hand over the charges?  After all that work, there is zero chance they would help anyone avoid the same workload.  Anyone who enters Vex Thal will have put an enormous amount of work into it, I doubt anyone who has gone through that much work will want to see someone use any &quot;shortcuts&quot;</div></div><hr />

I.e. that the combine of the globe and the shaded sphere in  the restored scepter results in an empty restored scepter and an item with the charges of Vex Thall portal. <br />
<br />
The fact that the emperor's rod seems to summon *stacks* of shaded spheres seems to point to that, in fact. The emperor's kill being the most challenging part of the quest and resulting in possibly hundreds of charges of portals.<br />
<br />
Would be a pain in itself (storing containers is so much less convenient than storing items), but less than having to redo the scepter for every key.</div></div><hr />

You click the Scepter from Emperor Ssraeshza and you recieve a stack of 20 power sources.  The staff also has 2 charges so it yields 40 power sources.<br />
<br />
I would assume you combine all shards in the frame which would result in a 2 slot container for an orb of luclinite and the power source (which when combined would then get you the key).<br />

This would obviously be a bit different than what I had picked up earlier.  It is hard to segregate speculation from true facts since only a handful of people might have gotten that far. :)<br />
<br />
For the time being, I will leave it as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Add the ten shards to the frame from Akheva.<br />
2. Combine to make the Scepter.  This Scepter seems to be a 2 slot container.<br />
3. Add the Orb of Luclinite AND one of the summoned Shaded Spheres.<br />
4. Combine to re-energize the Scepter.<br />
5. Obtain Vex Thal key ====&gt; form and fashion still unknown<br />
6. Use key to enter Vex Thal  ======&gt; possibly thru a spell effect.<br />
<br />
We will probably have to be a bit patient to get this confirmed. Edited by: Xiggin at: 4/26/02 7:05:03 pm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fastasia</div><div class="date">04-27-02, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an observation on the shards and why they seem like a rare drop....<br />
<br />
If the shard is a random drop on any 50+ mob in the zone then it makes sense that it seems rare since some of these zones rarely spawn a level 50 mob. So far the drops seem more common, the higher in level the mob. If a mob is 45-50 it still cons blue to a 60 even though it may not be high enough to be able to drop the shard. Thus the reason it drops off mobs like the Hunters in ME or the Sun Revenants in the Grey or the mobs a bit deeper in Acrylia.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to try to get the highest level mobs you can in those zones and see if the randomness seems to go down a bit.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts,<br />

<br />
But if these people wanna camp shards, there's not much you can do about it.  As for saying they can't kill the emperor, I don't think that is a valid statement.  40 pieces from emperor each week means unless you are a total zerg guild, you will not need that staff he drops for more than 2-3 kills.  What then?  Are you going to destroy the 40 extra pieces each week?  Or more likely are you going to give them to friends and/or sell them?

<br />
Let's not fall in the trap to discuss the required strength of the guilds that can enter Vex Thal.   A similar thread on the Druid Grove was nothing short of being utterly pathetic.<br />
<br />
Vex Thal is similar to Sleepers.  It takes high level encounters to get the necessary keys and it takes high level guilds to fight when making it inside.   It was designed that way and seems to work as intended, albeit at a great time expense.<br />
<br />
The best thing to do is ignore the posters who complain about them possibly being locked out of a zone they have no business to want to enter in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is far worse than Sleeper's Tomb.<br />
<br />
By my own rough estimations, you'll need an investment of about 400h of camps and raiding to get a key (along with your guildmates. If you're greedy, pick the first drop all the time, and never come back at that specific camp/raid after, you can of course do it in less. Assuming your guild doesn't kick you out if you do that). and that's done by estimating the camp time to get 6 drops for one-group doable camps, 12 for 2-groups, or 30 for 30-people raids.<br />
<br />
Yep, about 400h @#%$ hours of play time. And I'm probably optimistic on some drop rates.<br />
<br />
In fact, the killing of the emperor itself (once you manage that) is probably the best part/time ratio. One fight, 40 pieces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should increase the shard drop rate throughout and make the Emperor drop only 10 spheres at a time and put a 1 week respawn on him. That way the same guild wont enter VT any faster and would atleast have some more fun finishing the keys plus get some Emperor loot while at it, not to mention it wiull get rid of this incessant bickering.<br />

After wasting a couple hours yesterday, I thought I would come here to see if someone else knows.<br />
<br />
We tried killing all the sacrificial remains or just killing the back sacrificial remains. Once we saw a shimmering presence spawn, but some idiot cleric killed it. It didnt spawn again after much trying.<br />
<br />
I dont know if a shimmering presence is a week spawn thats delayed from server up, or its on its own spawn and spawns/despawns or if one (or all) of the sacrificial remains are placeholders for it. Anyone have any idea? Has anyone seen a shimmering presence up with all four sacrifical remains?<br />

You seem to be thinking that you can hand in multiple Wisps/EE's, you can not.  One shimmering presence = 1 shadowed scpeter frame.<br />

I like to think of it as a camp for an 11th shard, as it can sometimes take a long time for the shimmering persences to spawn.</div></div><hr />

At least that lame pained soul camp was out of the way, and poor xp for anyone that would be hanging around there.  the FG and ME camps are decent xp, and decent loots too.<br />

Then add in the fact that everyone and their grandmother are collecting these shards, whether or not they are ever going to combine them, and create the unadorned sceptre, which they could theoretically do,  but then why?

<br />
Quoted:<br />
Head to Akheva. From the zone in, run straight, past the fallen pillar. When you get to the next room, head right. Going left will take you to Va'Dyn. Go down the next set of stairs. To your right is IV. Go left, you will see a large &quot;gate&quot; with two &quot;shades&quot; standing on the left and right edges of this gate.<br />
<br />
Pull the far right shade, it will bring 2 mobs. Clear them, then move in hugging the right side. Cross directly over the open area and kill the alien midget mob that is by a set of stairs. Then run up those stairs where you will fight 3 alien mobs that have 4 arms each. They only hit for ~160s and can be slowed. Be sure to root the last one. Sometimes they will drop a &quot;Ans Xundrau xi Tekar&quot; 13/25 3 to all stats dagger, melee and caster only.<br />
<br />
At this point, you can drop down from the stairs and you will see a number of green con &quot;Sacrificed Remains&quot; and a &quot;Shimmering Presence.&quot; <br />
<br />
From there you will need items from a mage and a necro to continue the script.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. To obtain the scepter frame in Akheva, not need to kill any mobs whatsoever to get to the room with the sacrificed remains (placeholders for the Shimmering Presence).  Simply invis up and be ready to run to zone if you trip the traps along the way.  The traps reset approx every 6 minutes, other than that you can invis all the way to the room.  Once in the room, the safe spot is right inside the &quot;gate&quot; to right right at the corner.  <br />
2. If you are a gate or fd class you can do this part solo if you are careful.  Have a cleric standing by in case you get unlucky.     Gate classes can simply nuke the placeholders which have less than 1khp, then egress or gate to the zoneline if you aggro anything.  Rinse and repeat until the shimmering presence spawns.  Same with FD classes.  Have your wisp and Essence Emerald ready.  The only placeholders that will aggro the mobs on the floor are the ones closest to the them.<br />
<br />
3. The piece needed to combine in the unadorned scepter with the orb of luclinite is called a celestial rift, not a shaded sphere and are no longer summoned from a staff.  They are dropped off mobs you kill after the Emperor is down.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

put your back to the wall looking out at the room.<br />
<br />
You can kill the back 3 remains spawns - the 4th will agro at least one mob in the room<br />
<br />
--- spawn time is 5 mins.. <br />
<br />
just keep kiling those 3 with whatever range ability you have (arrows, spell...)  they have under 150 HPs<br />
<br />
When the presence spawns - do the turn ins - invis and leave.<br />
<br />
Warning - if it spawns in the third spot out from the cubby - creeping up to do the turnin - will agro the 4 arms above.. you will have time to do the turnin -but you will likely die and need to invis in to pull your corpse out<br />

To go to IC: go in the big room after the gate where the shards mobs popped before revamp, go left up stairs with skeletons, go right in the big room and after the door is a statue which port you to IC.<br />
