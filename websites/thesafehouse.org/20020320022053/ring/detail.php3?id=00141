<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#EFEDBA">Born and raised in Kelethin, I was raised to become like my father, a Druid and Farmer. The morning in which I last saw him, he told me:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Son, you are much more agile and better off with weapons than myself. Even though it was my duty to bring you up in the ways of Druidism, I feel that we both know you were meant to do something else.  It is now your decision my son, to choose the way of life you feel.  Do not worry about how other see you, just how you see yourself."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Later that day, waiting for my father to return from foraging food for supper, my mother was kidnapped. The guards of Kelethin just watched the masked men take her and did nothing to stop it.  It was the next day, after still not seeing or hearing from my father I realized I had lost both of my parents.  Being only an apprentice (in a job I did not like), no one wanted to hire me and soon lost my families space in town. I then realized I had to fend for myself, and thus began to rob and steal what I needed to survive<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Three years later, at the age of 17, 'finding' items from various creatures in the forest I was jumped by 3 Orc's who wished me dead.  Running for my life, I was certain my days of stealing and life as a whole was over. Passing, the spires near town I was struck to the ground nearly unconscious, when  I saw another Wood Elf, wielding two daggers run to the Orcs. He took the first one out  with a mighty blow to the back, instantly killing him. He then preceded to land multiple, very fast attacks to the other two.....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What felt like days later, I awoke alone by the spires in which I thought would be my final resting place with a letter in my pocket and a old rusty dagger in my possession.  The contents of the note instructed me to meet a man at the farthest hut in town, where I would pay him back for saving me and also learn skills, some would dream of acquiring.  Thus my adventure, and new life beings........</td></tr>
