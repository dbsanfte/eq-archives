<br />
My point exactly.  If say you were reading an article on the Laci Peterson trial, and the author wrote it in nothing but legalese, not very many people would read it or can understand it outside of the legal profession.  Authors have to cater to mainstream &quot;dummy&quot; terms.  Anything more 'official' than that would only get viewed as pompous, much like pretentious lawyers who insists on using legalese rather than simple common every day terms.  <br />
<br />
Quote:I'm reading ESPN, and I see &quot;NHL claims $300M in losses.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of us views &quot;M&quot; used in the context mention here as &quot;million&quot; not roman numerals or like the financial text book glossary.  You were reading ESPN, not the Wall Street Journal or any other financial publication.  Sports is their industry, not finance.  They write to cater to their general audience, not just Wall Street snobs. Edited by: Nyssa Rainwhisper  at: 9/19/03 2:01 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In summary, K is thousands but with the metric system. It's just basically moving the decimal over to the right three places. M indeed is 1000 in Roman Numerals, and Prenn is 100% correct that MM would be added and not multiplied to equal a million, so that is indeed a bastardization. And I have no idea what ESPN was trying to say. So I guess we haven't made an ounce of progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Loxmyf</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Australia, anyone reporting to lose $300M is losing $3,000,000.  You can prove this yourself by going to the company website and looking in the financial reports, or annual reports.  The annual reports always show figures, not abbreviations.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
ekati.bhpbilliton.com/docs/2000SEAReportNorthernSpending.pdf shows:<br />
<br />
Top of page 3<br />
Quote:The total cumulative spending for the Operations Phase is $671,921,024.33<br />
<br />
Therefore the media show that as &quot;BHP spent $672M&quot;<br />
<br />
The only time &quot;MM&quot; shows up in the media is in words like &quot;communucation, communism, programme&quot; etcetra.<br />

Part of my job is reading various finance and banking journals, including Euromoney, Euroweek, The Banker, Institutional Investor, LatinFinance, Asiamoney, Investor's Relations Monthly, Fortune, The Economist, blah blah blah.  None of the periodicals I read use MM for millions.<br />
<br />
Anything reported in the mainstream media almost always going to be a big number, over a million.  Deals for $100,000 aren't really newsworthy.  M is million, bn is billion and any other numbers are rarely reported.  Anything below a million is recorded in millions.  For example, 700,000 would be 0.7m.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well it's the same logic<br />
<br />
$3M = $ 3 Mille (means 1000 in latin/whateva) = $3k = $ 3,000.-<br />
$3MM = $ 3 Mille Mille (1000 * 1000) = $3,000.- * 1000 = $ 3,000,000.-<br />

most financial terms come from latin language. try looking up &quot;bankrupt&quot; and its origins for example.<br />

Thanks Northerner.  Was wondering if I was going to have to actually say this 20some replies into the thread.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the banking industry is a bunch of wanks.  If they want to represent crap in roman numerals they should do it all the way.  Mixing two different numeric systems is just foolish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'K' has no value. 'k' on the other hand is 1000. 'M' is 1000000, extept when dealing with bytes in which case it is 1024*1024 or 2^20 = 1048576.<br />
<br />
I had never heard the finincial industry was messed and didnt know ther unit prefixes. I guess next ill find out that the banks think 10^8 means 10.8 or something.<br />

<br />
Not true, in a credit write-up and such, you will still see $.  The only time you see USD is when you deal with the international department of a bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Northerner</div><div class="date">09-25-03, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's actually a domestic issue more than anything and should be properly footnoted or clarified in finacial documents.  Normally there is a standard &quot;in compliance with&quot; clause to cover it though.  $US, $CAN or $AUS is common if there is any chance of confusion.  It isn't wrong to just use '$' in an American publication though of course.<br />
<br />
MB is a different case though, stemming from the nature of binary counting.  While perhaps not 'pure' metric (there is a class-action lawsuit out over this right now actually), it is perfectly correct in context, much like MM is perfectly correct in it's contexts.</div></div><hr />
