Just curious if there would be enuff people to get a group together to play.</div></div><hr />

The DM says stuff like, &quot;I'm a lot drunker then I look,&quot; and the fighter keeps trying to attack the flaming elves. <br />
<br />
&quot;I attack the flaming elves.&quot;<br />
&quot;For the last time, there aren't any more flaming elves.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
&quot;You attack the tree.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Berdusk</div><div class="date">09-24-02, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here I was going to say something witty... but since I can't always be witty, and it is rather hard to act witty when you're not, I won't say anything witty.<br />
<br />
There is currently no software out there that I know of that would allow the DMing of a 3rdEd D&amp;amp;D game, with the possible fuzzy exception of Neverwinter Nights.<br />
<br />
Note that this is in the Pen &amp;amp; Paper Rogues forum.<br />
Basically, what Icebreaker is looking for, as I understand it, is people who know or can learn the tabletop / pen and paper version of D&amp;amp;D and play that online, theoretically through some chat program.<br />
<br />
So there's no real way to download D&amp;amp;D 3rd edition online. You'd have to travel to your local gaming/comic store or order the 3rd Edition Player's Handbook online. <br />
<br />
Some dice would help too, unless you can find a script that will generate random whole numbers in a specific range with a specific chance.<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, Wizards of the Coast upped the price to $29.99 or somesuch for the PHB.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebreaker</div><div class="date">10-20-02, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy folks been abit figured i'd give this old thread a bump still interested in playing if we'd get 4 or so people.<br />
<br />
as for a couple responces to comments <br />
Berdusk was correct  dnd online isn't a program persay its just playing pnp DnD online  instead of in person.<br />
<br />
There are a few different programs specifically designed for doing this like webrpg openrpg and kloogewerks as well as  just playing in an irc chat enviorment using Dice bots.<br />
<br />
I've been using Kloogewerks for me its by far the easiest to prepair stuff for the adventure..if your really good as a dm winging it might be easier tho LOL.I'm still pretty green at dming so i can use all the help i can get :-)<br />
Heres some screen caps of what klooge is like<br />
Heres the DM's view:<br />
left part is the campaign tree where you put all your maps,pics,npcs and monsters all items can have character sheets which have die rolls generated from directy.<br />
bottom left is mini map which you can zoom and scroll around quicky with.<br />
The right is the map view<br />
The dm has full control to reveal the areas of the maps and make any object visible to the player when appropriate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Heres the same map but from the players perspective.<br />
You can see how it only shows whats visiable in the players campaign tree as well as fully covering unexplored area's of the map.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each PC and Npc has a fully detailed character sheet which is parsed to make die rolls as easy as a right click ..you can also just open a die roller pane if you want tho.<br />
Heres a cap showing some rolls that are pulled from a  character sheet.As well as part of Tordeks CS<br />
<br />
<br />
Dm's can have room descriptions prewriten and cut and paste em as the party explores the locations also pictures can be sent to clients to visually highlight a scene.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope that clears up the whole playing online software side of it<br />
really all ya need is chat and a die roller program rest just makes it bit easier and abit more visual</div></div><hr />

If your in we'd just need 1 more(really would prefer 4 players to round out a group)<br />
If not we'd still need a couple others.<br />
<br />
IF we get enuff to make a full group how would sat or sun afternoon sound for a play time? That way Kintire could join as well. Say 12 to 3 or 4ish est that would make it evening for Kintire but not to overly late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">10-22-02, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sunday anytime is good for me. And yes, count me in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">10-23-02, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sunday would be better for me, as I am away on weekends fairly often. I'm usually back on Sunday afternoon, though, so Sunday evenings would normally be fine. I might have to miss some from time to time, but hopefully I'd be around 3 weeks out of 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebreaker</div><div class="date">10-23-02, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NP Kintire I’m thinking maybe bi monthly Sunday afternoons how would that sound for everyone? Every other Sunday basically if that’s cool with everyone. Kintire are you +6 hrs from Eastern Time? if so that would work out to be around 6pm for a starting time for you.. how does that sound?<br />
<br />
So far we got 3 just need one more<br />
Kintire<br />
Krimzan<br />
Biral<br />
<br />
I guess i should ask the question does everyone know how to play DnD 3E? and does everyone have a copy of the PHB..if not its not a problem just need to know what info I’ll need to provide for the players.<br />
Also if you have played DnD3E has anyone played The sunless citadel.. if so i'll find a different adventure to start with but if no ones played it.. i already have that one setup.. up to you all really.<br />
As i said this will be a basic/beginners game since I'm  fairly new as a  dm and everyone will need to learn the interface as well so figure the first couple sessions will be as much learning as straight playing.. it doesn't take long to figure out the program honestly tho.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the adventure goes everyone’s going to start at 1st level standard PHB packages so you all  can pick your race/class now so we know who will be what if you like.<br />
<br />
Would you all prefer to roll for your stats or just 30point buy?<br />
I'll go either way, for rolling it will be 4d6 for each, drop the lowest and arrange at your preference.. but we'll do the rolling within game and well the die roller streaks sometimes so heh its up to you all.<br />
<br />
Welp heres hoping we get a forth soon :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">10-24-02, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the time we start I will be Eastern Time plus 5 (Clocks go back from British Summer Time to GMT this saturday night).<br />
<br />
I'm pretty familiar with 3rd edition. I'm happy with either character gen system, we usually use the rolling method, but I'm easy.<br />
<br />
I'm currently thinking possibly Bard, but I might be persuaded to go cleric if no one else wants to.<br />
<br />
In the event that I get clerically inspired, which pantheon are we on? The Greyhawk one from the PHB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebreaker</div><div class="date">10-24-02, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">either PHB Pantheon or Forgotten Realms would be fine but gonna stick with 3 core books for spells/feats and stuff for now.<br />
If there is something ya's want to use from a different publication let me know I'll see if i got a copy of it or if i can get one. &amp;lt;img<br />

There's a much better range of deities on Forgotten Realms, so I'll use those. I don't feel any burning need to take anything else from outside the PHB.<br />
<br />
Do I need to download any software for this game? if so, where from?<br />
<br />
Incidently, to avoid spamming the boards too much, can I have your email address? Edited by: Kintire at: 10/24/02 8:11:14 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebwork</div><div class="date">10-24-02, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll all need to install the Kloogewerks client and java run time<br />
heres the links<br />
java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html<br />
grab the appropriate jre download and install(first or second one mostlikely)<br />
<br />
then grab this <br />
www.kloogeinc.com/werks/f..._1_4_3.jar<br />
and install it to say c programfiles\klooge.werks\<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats it i have 4 client licenses so no one needs to play for anything so no worries there<br />
<br />
my home email is icebreaker@sympatico.ca<br />
I'll probably keep posting most things here. try and stir up some more community interest ;-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebreaker</div><div class="date">11-17-02, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry Biral been meaning to make a post this week<br />
<br />
As it stands we only have 3 players. I've been waiting hoping someone else would speak up and ask to join :-)..but as that hasn't happened what i was gonna post and ask is if you'se all are ok with the idea of only having 3 players in your party with a henchman to round the party out to 4 PC's ..<br />
<br />
I really think we would need at least 4 PC's in the adventures i'm going to run and if its alright with you all I'll setup the NPC henchman to fill whatever nitch the party needs.<br />
<br />
I believe Biral just got a copy of the 3E PHB resently and hopefully has had a chance to go thru the classes ect..<br />
IF you would like to post what classes/races you want to play that would be great.<br />
Kintire had mentioned in email he would like to play a cleric <br />
<br />
Post when you each would be available to meet up to roll for your character stats.. I'm available evenings after 430pm est weekdays or anytime on weekends.<br />
<br />
Its up to you if you all want to individually go thru and create your characters in the Klooge CS editor or i can impute the info for you'se. For stats we will roll within the game to set your stats tho rest of the character creation can be done by each of ya's on your own time using standard packages or variants from the PHB.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh kloogewerks 1.4.5 is the latest build so thats what we'd be using.<br />
 the java link from before is still the one we'd use<br />
heres the kloogewerks link<br />
www.kloogeinc.com/werks/f..._1_4_5.jar<br />
<br />
Maybe if we could get all the character creation out of the way we could try to schedual a session for the weekend.<br />

Any objections to a sorceror?</div></div><hr />

and yep if you want you can do rest of character creation on your own <br />
In the Kloogewerks install directory there is a CSed.jar file thats the character sheet editor if you want to start imputing your stuff into and just email it to me after we do the stats taht would be cool.<br />
send me a message what time you want to meet up to do the rolls i'm around every evening 4pm to 11pmish est<br />
<br />
Also how's dec 1st sound to everyone else say 12pm est? &amp;lt;img<br />

so whats up Kintire is Sunday a definate no? if so we can reschedual for next weekend if needed.<br />
<br />
Elerion at the moment i only have 4 client licences for use with program so I'm kinda stuck to that limit for now.<br />
If after things get started all goes well (load of four client connect to server ect ect) I'll probably see about adding 4 more licences.At this point i'd like to keep it as a 4 person party till we make sure all goes well.</div></div><hr />
