      <blockquote> 
        <div align="left"> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wow. I really 
            don&#146;t know how all the hardcore players have done it, but I&#146;m 
            impressed. I just hit 60 recently and the game CHANGED. Not the AA 
            skills, not Luclin, not even the new Planes of Power just announced, 
            I mean the GAME changed&#133; The game is&#133; different now. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before you&#146;re 
            50, 60 is a dream. No, more like a myth. You drool over all the places 
            you want to go and mobs you&#146;ll be exposed to. You have both respect 
            and resentment, not to mention a bit of awe for those that have completed 
            the impossible&#133; Level 60.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you hit 50, 
            it starts to sink in, &quot;This is possible after all&#133;&quot; 
            now the mobs are not so much a thing of &quot;Gee, I&#146;d like to 
            kill that&quot; and now more of &quot;I hope I live through this.&quot; 
            The gear starts to get better, the Mobs get tougher, the quests become 
            more challenging than running back and forth between zones, you start 
            an Epic, you join(or change to) a guild that is focused on raiding 
            more difficult and challenging mobs. After 50 you really start to 
            be exposed to what the game of EQ can be like. I sometimes compare 
            the high level raids to a prehistoric Mammoth hunt, 50 people working 
            together to take down a beast that could easily squish any single 
            member of the hunting party. The teamwork, trust in your teammates 
            to do their job and awareness of one&#146;s self capabilities are 
            absolutely vital. Unfortunately this is also a period of time where 
            you need to really stay focused on what the &quot;older&quot; players 
            are telling you&#133; unfortunately most don&#146;t, and they die 
            a lot.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">54&#133; 54 just 
            sucks the life out of you. My opinion is that 54 is the only TRUE 
            hell level. The experience crawls and all the good stuff on the other 
            side is like gold in Fort Knox, you can look, but not touch. You are 
            high enough to want to participate on some of the high end raids, 
            but low enough to not live through them all the time. The strategies 
            at raids are starting to make more sense, and you&#146;re actually 
            starting to feel that you are contributing more. About the only saving 
            grace to 54 is that it will eventually be over.</font></p>
        </div>
        <div align="left"> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">55 through 58 
            is not bad but no piece of cake. Now you can roam through the tougher 
            zones without total fear of instant death, the Disciplines/Spells/Abilities 
            are starting to get cool, the gear is starting to be useful and you 
            may be lucky enough to get your Epic. Now you start to live through 
            the raids and begin to get a better picture of how all the things 
            that others have been telling you have sunk in as you see the &quot;younger&quot; 
            players making the same mistakes you did.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last &quot;hell 
            level&quot; (well the second one now&#133;/rude Verant) 59 is, in 
            my opinion again, not REALLY a hell level&#133; Why you ask? 59 is 
            like standing in the kitchen while brownies are baking. They smell 
            so good, you know you&#146;re going to have them, and all you have 
            to do is wait 20 more minutes&#133; It&#146;s just that those 20 minutes 
            seem to take an eternity. Because 60 is just around the corner you 
            are more motivated to level and you are powerful enough that that 
            stuff dies faster, so your experience moves faster than it did at 
            lower levels, not to mention that it&#146;s easier to get groups. 
            For me, 59 took me less time of actual playing than several of my 
            prior hell levels.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But now I&#146;m 
            60. I&#146;m there. I can really imagine what it was like for those 
            that hit 60 in Kunark. Velious is much the same, once you hit 60 it 
            could very well be, &quot;What now?&quot; Some turned to Quests. Some 
            turned to their guilds to help others. Some started to focus on tradeskills. 
            Some became mentors to help specific friends. Some small percentage 
            even become scouts, always exploring those places that they had not 
            been to before, paving the way for their guild or friends to new adventures. 
            For many it was a combination of all of the above. Some even turned 
            away from the toon they played so faithfully for so long, to start 
            an alternate character to begin the process all over.</font></p>

            which of these paths hold *my* fate, probably a little bit of each 
            of them I suppose, but I still know one thing. The game has changed 
            for me. Not sure whether it&#146;s good or bad&#133; Just different&#133; 
            and change is the one thing we can all expect in life, so I&#146;m

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
            scruffy dwarf wearily dropped his traveling pack to the ground beside 
            his already dozing barbarian friend. The barbarian, through his one 
            good eye, peered at the dwarf with a hint of irritation and muttered, 
            &quot;Ye move like a clumsy snow orc, ye blasted runt.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">&quot;It 
            be the only way ye can see me, ye blind fool,&quot; replied the dwarf 
            as he adjusted pack for use as a headrest. The barbarian's only reply 
            was a gentle snore. It had been a long three days traveling through 
            the vast Karana plains. Many encounters with the local wildlife had 
            left them both completely blown of energy and quite frankly more than 
            a little concerned about their own skins. The latest encounter with 
            a surly bandit had not gone well and thankfully they were able to 
            lose the killer in the canyons that transitioned the plains to the 
            hills of Qeynos, legendary city of the west.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
            It had been more than three weeks since they'd last seen any other 
            adventurers and the sense of &quot;aloneness&quot; grew on them both 
            daily. The rumors of a gnoll hideout filled with significant treasures 
            and what the bartender at the last inn had referred to as &quot;easy 
            pickins&quot; had pointed the two travelers to the western territories 
            in search of the gnoll lair. For the barbarian, it was the first time 
            he'd been near his homelands since he'd left as a screaming toddler 
            in the terrified arms of a mother fleeing a savage bunch of warrior 
            gnolls. For the dwarf, it was the lure of underground wonders and 
            treasure. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">As 
            the dwarf rested on the ground nearby a shade tree, he turned his 
            gaze to the pillowy clouds above and the full weight of his weariness 
            began to settle on his limbs. Fighting to keep his heavy lids open 
            and some semblance of alertness, he began to mentally review the proper 
            backstab technique as taught to him by the leader of Miner's Guild 
            628.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
            peaceful reverie was suddenly interrupted by a tremendously booming 
            voice that literally shook the ground, </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><i>&quot;THE 
            WORLD IS COMING DOWN! LOG OUT NOW!&quot;</i> <br>
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Both 
            the barbarian and the dwarf leapt to their feet, frantically looking 
            around in panic, both with knives at the ready. After a few confused 
            moments, the dwarf turned to the barbarian with a questioning look 
            upon his face. Silently, the barbarian shrugged unknowingly and&#133;collapsed 
            to the ground. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Before 
            the dwarf could react, the dwarf's vision became clouded and the words 
            &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; slipped through his mind as 
            the world vanished from sight and darkness filled everything.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Welcome 
            to the world that was the Test Server. It's not quite like that anymore 
            but it makes a good intro to a column, doesn't it? Welcome to my first 
            column for The Safehouse. I'm known around these parts as Kezzek Bladefiend 
            and you may know me from such things as &quot;Iron Fist of the Forums&quot;, 
            &quot;That Jerk Who Moved My Post&quot;, &quot;Keeper of the Ring&quot;, 
            or even as &quot;Test Server Punishment Glutton&quot;. Now I'm here 
            trying to help create a bigger, better, more informative and entertaining 
            web site. Whether I'm actually helping remains to be seen&#133; (chuckle) 
            The purpose of this particular column is to introduce myself (naturally) 
            and to give some insight into the trials and tribulations of a Test 
            Server playtester.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">I 
            began playing EQ in the open beta Phase 4 on Fennin Ro. I'll confess 
            that at the time I wasn't really testing anything-I was taking advantage 
            of the PLAY portion of playtesting. Since it was the last phase of 
            the Beta test though, I don't think that was a bad thing. I later 
            realized that just by being there, Verant was able to use player load 
            to stress test their servers prior to final release. Ok&#133;I'm rationalizing.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">After 
            the Beta test, I played on Fennin Ro for the first couple months after 
            final release and quickly became immersed in the glories of Norrath. 
            But, it wasn't long before I realized I missed the exciting and sometimes 
            frustrating environment of the Beta test. &quot;Being in the know&quot;, 
            in a sense, really appealed to me and I created a (short-lived) ranger 
            on the Test Server that I would run around &quot;testing&quot; things. 
            I'd ram my head into walls trying to find clipping problems. I'd force 
            my character into every spot in the zone. I got stuck a lot. (I still 
            do that. Just ask me about the upper mast of the Freeport/Kaladim 
            boats.) I'd try to equip items in every slot-whoops! I can wear that 
            gauntlet on my face! That kind of stuff. It was mundane but I felt 
            I was accomplishing something. And I was accomplishing things but 
            mostly I was just spinning my wheels because I was fairly clueless 
            about what my actual purpose was as a Test Server playtester. It wasn't 
            until I brought over a friend who had more testing (from MUDs) experience 
            than I did that I really began to understand the purpose, possibilities 
            and responsibilities that a playtester has.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Verant, 
            like every other company that creates an online massively multi-user 
            dungeon, has a server set aside to provide a buffer for game code 
            between the in-house models and the general public (production) servers. 
            The purpose of this is to allow the programmers to get an idea of 
            how the new game code will affect the Norrathian world but without 
            affecting the paying customers who don't wish to be (and shouldn't 
            be) exposed to glaring problems. It provides a limited &quot;scale 
            model&quot; to expose the code to playtesters who will promptly try 
            to find every way to &quot;break&quot; it. In other words, playtesters 
            try to use the new code in every possible way even above and beyond 
            what even programmer may have imagined. This is a very important step 
            and it must be done thoroughly because if exploits or &quot;loopholes&quot; 
            make it onto the production servers, there are inevitably big problems. 
            Public Relations not being the least of them.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Now 
            what the heck did I mean by &quot;possibilities&quot;? </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Well, 
            quite frankly, this stuff can be exciting and fun! As a playtester, 
            you are exposed to things that hundreds of thousands of other players 
            haven't seen yet AND may never see. That nifty Evade skill? At first, 
            it never failed. NEVER. That battle in the Arena with lions, tigers, 
            and skeletons? Straight outta Gladiator, baby! CARNAGE. Hey, check 
            out that new Cobalt armor! WOOO! </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">There 
            are literally new things in the game every day on the Test Server. 
            It's refreshing! It's dynamic! It's really low player population! 
            It's the best of all worlds, right!?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Not 
            so fast there. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">With 
            all these code changes, there are a lot of problems. Sometimes very, 
            very strange problems. That new spell update just turned your Burning 
            Rapier into rations! Whoa, that last patch just deleted your bank 
            inventory? OH NO! That new sound code killed your framerate so the 
            game is virtually unplayable? Tough nuts, buddy, it's going to be 
            like that all night or perhaps forever. </font></p>

            is no GM or Guide support on Test Server. If you can't locate your 
            corpse even with the aid of a bard or necro? It's simply gone? I'm 
            sorry, but there's nothing that a GM can do. Your inventory is gone 
            after the patch? Sorry. &quot;Hey, when I zoned into Blackburrow, 
            my Runed Falchion morphed into a small bag. I'm freakin' holding a 
            bag on my hand!&quot; Sorry, can't be helped. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Perhaps 
            most agonizing of all is that the entire time you are on Test Server, 
            you are inherently susceptible to problems every day. EVERY single 
            day the Test Server is taken offline at least once, usually several 
            times. Sometimes it's down for days! Each and every time the server 
            is taken offline, they &quot;roll back&quot; the environment a little 
            bit. In other words, those 2 bubbles of level 40 experience you just 
            got in your overnight marathon session? GONE, baby! You may even lose 
            recently acquired items simply due to the fact that they put that 
            server back online with an earlier &quot;server save&quot; (when the 
            server records world environment and character info). It happens. 
            Every. Single. Day. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Frustrating? 
            It certainly is. Those are just some of the possibilities. Test Server 
            is a very scary place sometimes. Just ask a playtester about the item 
            wipe. So why do it then? Well, that's up to each person to decide. 
            Perhaps you get a strong sense of accomplishment for finding and reporting 
            bugs. Maybe it feels good to converse with a programmer and help them 
            nail down that sound code. Or maybe it's just pretty damn cool to 
            be the first to have the &quot;Ethereal Totem of World Destruction&quot;. 
            (ahem. I made that up. Get back here.) It's different for every person. 
            Ask 10 playtesters why they do it, get 500 answers. (See my reference 
            to outthinking the programmer above.) It all comes down to a sense 
            of responsibility, I think. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
            playtesters have a responsibility to take everything the programmers 
            throw at them and work with it. No bitching. No moaning. Just test 
            it, try to work with it, and tell Verant what you find out. It's the 
            tester's responsibility to try to think of everything that Verant 
            programmers haven't. Most importantly it's the testers responsibility 
            to help make this game better through diligent testing and LARGE amounts 
            of patience and understanding. Norrath is a huge, dynamic world. Every 
            little code change can impact the world in multitudes of unforeseen 
            ways. It's a playtester's responsibility to find those ways. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Not 
            every problem is readily apparent either. Maybe through an unusual 
            set of button combinations, you determined how to move while rooted. 
            Now&#133;.which button combo did it? Replicate it! Sometimes it seems 
            like you're doing forensics and trying to piece together the scene 
            of the crime. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">So, 
            you may now be thinking, &quot;How do I get to this Test Server anyway?&quot; 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">It's 
            fairly easy. Within the Everquest directory, locate a file called 
            &quot;testeverquest.exe&quot;. That's the program that connects you 
            to the Test patch server. Be aware though that by patching to the 
            Test Server code, you will overwrite many production server code files 
            on your computer. While you won't lose any items, characters, or such 
            (It's a different server, after all.) you will be forced to sit through 
            quite an extensive patching time. Be patient. Also be aware that when 
            you reconnect to the standard servers, you'll be forced to re-patch 
            back to the production code. (Note: there is a directory trick that 
            helps with the patch time, but I won't go into it here.) </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Hopefully, 
            I opened your eyes a little bit about what the Test Server is and 
            does. It's definitely not for most players who simply want to play 
            the game and have fun. If you're the type who can stand a little punishment 
            in order to help make the game a bit better for others, then perhaps 
            the Test Server is right up your alley. </font></p>
