<br />
<br />
I think overall this was a great year for Awards going to who they should have.<br />
<br />
However, one MAJOR exception -- I was really disappointed when Sean Penn got it over Bill Murray.  You could tell everyone in the place wanted Murray to get it, Billy Crystal included.  <br />
<br />
Lost in Translation was such a great movie, I'm glad it got Sofia Coppola Best Original Screenplay at the very least.  But dang, Murray so deserved that Oscar. <br />
<br />
I just can't stand Sean Penn, the guy never freaking smiles.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, RoTK winning just about everything and Sofia Coppola getting her award makes me happy at least.  Gonna be mad about the Best Actor thing for a while though, hehe :P Edited by: Glip the Gnome at: 2/29/04 9:07 pm</div></div><hr />

Umm, perhaps I'm mis-remembering but I don't recall Penn saying anything political tonight.  (If I knew where to look on the Internet to find his exact words, I would.)<br />
<br />
As for the awards themselves, kudos to LotR but I think all 11 was a bit of overkill.  It's almost as if voters never even saw any of the other movies.  Watching the 2004 Oscars was like watching the Superbowl where one team scores 60 points before halftime.  There's going to be no surprises at the end.</div></div><hr />

In fact, I was downright pissed.  Lost in Translation made me have badass dreams involving adventures in Tokyo with comedic Bill Murray and the lady he sat with in the hospital!  Whereas Sean Penn just bothers me.<br />
<br />
And then I got even more dismayed when I thought Murray might never play a role like this again that will lead to a nomination.  Has he ever won an award? Ghostbusters, Caddyshack, Groundhog Day, Scrooged! And then the brilliant Lost in Translation! AGH! HE DESERVES SOMETHING!<br />
<br />
And what about Depp?  Has he ever won an Oscar?  Brilliant actor always playing weird roles... although at least this one got a nomination.<br />

I would say that other nominees in the catagories of Art Direction, Film Editing, and Sound Mixing were definitely at least as good as LotR.  The only Oscar I felt they didn't truly deserve was for Best Song (the Belleville song was the only one that didn't put me to sleep).</div></div><hr />

Quote:And Sean Penn made a crack about there being no WMDs, it was one of the first things he said when he got up there. <br />
<br />
Exactly.  I believe he said something to the nature of, &quot;all actors know that there are no WMDs...&quot;<br />
<br />
Quote:LOTR deserved every one of those, it got bent over the barrel the last years.<br />
<br />
True, LotR did deserve all those awards, however, I think they viewed all 3 movies collectively for awards rather than seperately.  I can't recall the previous years but were FotR and TTT even nominated for anything?<br />
<br />
I think LotR did deserve all those awards.  Not only was it amazing, you've got to keep in mind, the cast and crew of LotR devoted over 9 years of their lives into making those 3 movies while others probably did what? 10 months?  Also, while many of their competitions were great, I just don't think they were really as great as LotR.  Like special effects for example.  One of competition was Master and Commander.  Now c'mon.  Ok, so the ship was pretty cool, but what's more amazing?  Epic battles which included fictitious oliphants, and an elf swinging up a tusk to shoot bad guys, or a ship being tossed around at sea?  Frankly, I think the only even scaled contender in the special effect category was Pirates.  If LotR didn't win, I sure as hell would've voted for Pirates for special effects.  The scene of them dueling in the cave between living and dead was pretty amazing alone. Edited by: Nyssa Rainwhisper  at: 2/29/04 11:47 pm</div></div><hr />

Of course, on the men's side, all you have to do is find a script that requires you to yell, scream and/or cry a half dozen times in a movie, and you are a shoo in for an Oscar.  Subtlety is lost on the Academy voters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 6 Previous ones were just there to try to hold off the hordes of people yelling at the Academy for snubbing it.  FOTR and TTT got SNUBBED.  I dont care what anyone says, The Acting in LOTR (all of em) was great, you cant have a great movie w/o it (if i wanted all CGI, id go be a pixar fanboi).  NO acting nods for ANY of em, aside from Iam Mckellens in FOTR, i dont think it got ANY nods.  They should give the Academy the golden raspberry for being idiots.  How you can say Jackson directed FOTR/TTT worse than ROTK, WHEN THEY WERE FILMED AT THE SAME TIME, is beyond me.  Editing I could see, but THEY WERE ALL FIMLED CONCURRENTLY!!!  BAH, now i need to go kill more people in DR, stupid Oscars!<br />
<br />
On a side note. A Beautiful Mind was well deserving of the Best Picture win, GREAT movie, better than Rouge and FOTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a big anti-fanbois, I have to say McKellens DESERVED an award for Gandalf. Jebus, he was everything I pictured Gandalf to be when I read Tolkien. Everyone else, meh. It was an adventure film. McKellen got stiffed.</div></div><hr />

Shoulda at least gotten nominated.  Sam was a good Character in the Last one, showed a lot of depth of character.<br />
<br />
Again, not saying, Give em the award, its LOTR and im a huge Fanboi, but gotta give the performances a nod, they were great films, carried from scene to scene by the Characters not... another hour till the next battle scene, time to go take a leak.<br />
<br />
Pah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">03-01-04, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much as I hate to say it, there were a LOT of people who deserved best actor/actress and best supporting actor/actress nods this year.  My favorites personally were Johnny Depp and Bill Murray.  I wanted Johnny Depp to win but I thought Bill Murray deserved to win.<br />
<br />
LotR didn't get actor nominations because you can't just nominate one of them.  The performances were so connected emotionally that it was hard to pick anyone out?  How could you pull out Frodo, Sam or Gollum.  How could you pull out Arowen, Aragorn, or Aowen.  How could you pull out Gandalf, Gimli or legolas?  And you'd have to have merry/pippen as a single nomination.  One of the things that made LotR a stellar movie, made it impossible to nominate it's actors.<br />
<br />
I think they did Snuff LotR the first 2 rounds and rewarded the series this time.  Honestly, I didn't think the theatrical version of TTT deserved to win.  FotR really was excellent though.  But man, competing against Mulan Rouge?  Rouge made a great nemisis for FotR.  Both are beautiful.  Both had excellent music and great stories.  A Beautiful Mind didn't deserve the award though.<br />
<br />
Finally, was Millennium Actress nominated for anything?  I think it at least deserved to be nominated for best animated film.  Cowboy bebop movie wasn't that good but Millennium Actress is amazing.  It's beautiful and compelling and the final sceen is extremely moving.  I don't think there's any arguement that Finding Nemo didn't deserve to win, if soley because of it's broad acceptance.  Parents to college kids, to pre schoolers enjoyed the movie, but Millennium Actress really is an amazing movie.<br />
<br />
But Sean Penn for best actor?  Damnit.  I know you went out of your way to reward us with the RotK wins but did you HAVE to throw a stereotypical bone for such a stereotypical oscar grab of a movie?  You had two.  count them TWO amazing actors in amazing rolls and you snubbed them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the Cowboy Bebop film, I think and I could be wrong about this, but I think it wasn't qualified for Oscar consideration anyway due to it's original release date in Japan.  I think.</div></div><hr />

I happen to love the &quot;Into the West Song&quot; -- the lyrics were simple but made great references to Tolkien lore. The melody/mood was perfect. The Bellevue song just sounded like a song of that genre (a decent one) but not an outstanding one.<br />
<br />
As far as political statements at the Oscars. I don't mind them saying them at all. I too, like this glimpse into what they might say vs a long list of names to Thank. And this year the statements that were made were really only short quips. Edited by: Fricka at: 3/1/04 5:21 pm</div></div><hr />

Sure you can.  Gollum (Andy Serkis) was clearly the standout performance of The Two Towers.  Samwise (Sean Astin) was clearly the standout performance of Return of the King.<br />
Quote:How could you pull out Frodo, Sam or Gollum.<br />
Is this the setup to a dirty joke?   <br />
Quote:How could you pull out Arowen, Aragorn, or Aowen.<br />
Considering Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is a man, and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Eowyn (Miranda Otto) are women, I'm afraid they would not be eligible for the same award nomination.<br />
Quote:How could you pull out Gandalf, Gimli or legolas?<br />
The Academy didn't seem to have much of a problem when they nominated Ian McKellen for his role as Gandalf in FotR.<br />
Quote:And you'd have to have merry/pippen as a single nomination.<br />
Why?  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are two completely different people playing two completely different characters.</div></div><hr />

I am, however, massively disappointed overall.<br />
<br />
There was not a single 'suprise' win. Every single award went to what conventional wisdom decreed. Not to denigrate LotR's technical achievements, but neither it nor Titanic can possibly have objectively been the best in all those categories. Voters are lazy, they just go with the costume epic with momentum in those categories. Sean Penn's performance was decent, but far from the best of his career (Thin Red Line). Tim Robbins got the 'Mystic River got screwed, better give them something' win. Renee got the 'Cold Mountain got screwed' win. Everyone in that category and about 300 people not in it outperformed her this year, but Cold Mountain's lack of noms and Chicago related guilt bought her this award. Charlize Theron won for uglying up for a role. Sophia Coppola won for not winning best picture.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just disillusioned by the fact that the awards were nakedly political, and who won what had more to do with history, legacy and mythmaking than awarding the best film had to offer in 2003.<br />
<br />
And, depressingly, here's the last 15 films to have won best picture:<br />
<br />
Rain Man<br />
Driving Miss Daisy<br />
Dances With Wolves<br />
Silence Of The Lambs<br />
Unforgiven <br />
Schindler's List<br />
Forrest Gump<br />
Braveheart<br />
The English Patient<br />
Titanic<br />
Shakespeare In Love<br />
American Beauty <br />
Gladiator<br />
A Beautiful Mind<br />
Chicago <br />
<br />
How many of these are honestly amongst what you consider the best films of all time? How many would you watch over and over? How many have you bothered to purchase on DVD? The only one I consider a great movie is Shakespeare In Love, and it should have lost to the vastly superior Thin Red Line.<br />
<br />
The Academy sucks.</div></div><hr />

I cried I was laughing so hard, havent seen mystic river yet so no coment there but Bill Murray was absolutly perfect in Lost in Translation. perfect to the point that its as if the role was written with him in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_minoltasrt101b</div><div class="date">03-02-04, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silence Of The Lambs is probably the easiest of those winners to defend. I wasn't a huge fan, but it definitely had it's appeal. Forrest Gump I wouldn't personally rate, but it definitely connected with people.<br />
<br />
Schindler's List, Driving Miss Daisy, The English Patient, Titanic, American Beauty and A Beautiful Mind are the worst kind of winners though. It's not that they're terrible movies, or even particularly bad - I'll watch most of them if they're on cable and I lack Law &amp;amp; Order reruns - it's just that their acceptance is manipulative. Deceiptful even. They take posistions where the zeitgest mandates a pro/con opinion be assumed, where if you disagree that they're great movies, you're automatically seen as attacking the philosophies behind them. No time for indifference, Doctor Jones, take a stand or be villified.<br />
<br />
Schindler's List was mediocre? Anti-semite. Disliked Driving Miss Daisy? You take political correctness too far! Bored by The English Patient or Titanic? You don't understand romance. Thought American Beauty was shallow and slow? Ivory tower intellectual who doesn't understand real life. Didn't get the appeal of A Beautiful Mind? How can you be so cold?<br />
<br />
Movies impossible to dislike spawn mass acceptance, which quickly becomes vindication. Everyone liked it, it must be great. Who cares how good they really were?<br />
<br />
Did they make you grip the edge of your seat? Did they send you running home to scour the imdb for insight and oversight? Did you count the minutes until you were able to see them again? Did you pre-order the DVD from Amazon and watch it twice in a row upon receiving it, and then again the next day with the commentary on? Did it keep you up nights thinking about it?<br />
<br />
If not, I submit that what you hold as greatness is mediocrity sheathed in a particularly cruel kind of hype. There's no thrill, merely a kind of resigned acceptance of greatness.<br />

Shakespeare in Love... ugh, decent, but better than Saving Private Ryan?  Noooooo Way!  I'm still bitter about that beating SPR!  Booo! Hissss!<br />

Amazingly, I actually agree with pretty everything here except for the last.  Sofia Coppola won because her last name is Coppola.<br />
Quote:and it should have lost to the vastly superior Thin Red Line.<br />
The fact that you think The Thin Red Line was a good movie lends you zero credibility, my friend.  That movie was absolutely boring and meaningless.  Of the 5 Best Picture nominees that year (others were Shakespeare in Love, Saving Private Ryan, Life is Beautiful, and Elizabeth), Red Line was the only movie that was nominated undeservingly.  It was overlong, the story was scatterbrained, and parts of it that were supposed to be dramatic were just unintentionally funny (i.e.: Woody Harrelson grenading his own keister off).<br />
Quote:Schindler's List was mediocre? Anti-semite.<br />
I wouldn't call someone who didn't like Schindler's List an anti-Semite (nor do I know anyone else who would).  I would say anyone who didn't like Schlinder's List just didn't appriciate the kind of raw, shocking filmmaking it used.  Or in your case, there just wasn't enough explosions.<br />
Quote:Bored by The English Patient or Titanic? You don't understand romance.<br />
I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that, yes, you don't understand romance.  That's your own problem though, not anyone else's.  (BTW, Titanic was an exceptionally well-done movie, I wasn't bored by it at all.  And I'm not your typical &quot;romantic&quot; either).<br />
Quote:Thought American Beauty was shallow and slow? Ivory tower intellectual who doesn't understand real life.<br />
Slow, yes.  Shallow, no.  But it won because competition that year was dreadful by comparison.<br />
Quote:Did you count the minutes until you were able to see them again? Did you pre-order the DVD from Amazon and watch it twice in a row upon receiving it, and then again the next day with the commentary on? Did it keep you up nights thinking about it?<br />
No, but then again, I don't do that with any of my favorite movies.  I'm a movie fan, not an obsessed psychopath.<br />
Quote:Some movies that the Academy could have honoured in the last 15 years (movies that thrilled me, at least, plus a few that didn't, but thrilled many):<br />
I can look at my DVD library and suggest all of them should have received Academy Awards as well.  &quot;Grrr, where are the Oscars for Army of Darkness, Get Shorty, and UHF?!&quot;<br />

&quot;My biggest problem is I don't think it was the best song un RotK. I really thnk Billy Boyd's short song in Steward of Gundor was better.&quot;<br />
                                    -Gyorg<br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly with this statement.<br />
<br />
I remember watching the movie the first time at the scene leading up to this song.  When I knew for sure that he was actually going to sing some sort of tune I felt this inner cringe, narrowed my eyes and mumbled &quot;this is gonna be sooo lame&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then Merry started singing, fantastically I might add, and they started the cutscenes of  Faramir leading his suicide charge.<br />
<br />
All I could think was WOW!  I was blown away by that scene.<br />
The mood of the song and the way it was presented was one of the finest pieces in the movie.  Not ashamed to say I got goosebumps.<br />
<br />
However it would probably be hard for this song to stand on it's own for a nomiation.</div></div><hr />

On the soundtrack, there's a long orchestral piece, then at the end they tacked on Billy Boyd's song.  In the movie, it nearly made me cry... on the soundtrack, not so much (although certainly the visuals in the movie account for much of that).  <br />

That being said... do they consider the movie version or the soundtrack version for an Oscar?  You would assume the movie version, but I don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
Regardless... if you don't own the soundtracks BUY THEM NOW... I listen to them more than any of my other music right now.  Plus it's great to listen to at work while I'm crunching numbers.</div></div><hr />
