<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vanidor Silverbranch</div><div class="date">09-23-02, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After a ton of hours, I managed to solve the Tortured Librarian quest in kaesora. Thanks to Mercuratrayin for mentioning his response to hails, I wouldn't have know the quest existed and tried books without it. Thanks to Korey Portagirl &amp;lt;Celstial Navigators&gt; for helping me track and kill the Iksar tomb raider multiple times and finally finding the right drop while I was offline.<br />
<br />
Mailed it to Allakhazam a few days ago, but not sure when it might show. First, the screen shots:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Go to the Emerald jungle and clear the the northwest area, on top of the plateau, of mobs.<br />
A iksar outcast will spawn with the name 'an Iksar tomb raider' as very rare spawn. He is<br />
approximately 33-35th and seems to spawn about one in every one hundred kills. I was unable<br />
to identify a placeholder/spawn cycle. He will wander that area back and forth, I didn't see<br />
go off the cliff to the lower areas or despawn but I can't be sure of either. You will likely<br />
need a group at 35th level to do this, but the experience will be good if the group is capable<br />
of chain pulls and sets up outside the various mobs pathing along the north wall.<br />
<br />
Kill him and he always drops one book, which can be one of several Iksar history books. The<br />
common drops are the same books as sold in Cabilis. His uncommon drop is a No Rent version<br />
of Venril the Chief, it is tradeable. This is similar to the ones sold in stores in that<br />
it covers the rise of Venril Sathir and his creation of an Iksar Empire.<br />
<br />
Once you have that book, you bring an Emerald to Dom K'Perl in the Dark Elf outpost of<br />
The Overthere. Handing it to him will result in a tradeable No Rent book called 'Before Green'.<br />
If you are Kill on sight at the outpost and worried about being attacked by guards, you can<br />
have someone hand in the Emerald and trade the book back to you.<br />
<br />
Take the two no rent books and a group to Kaesora's library and clear it until the Tortured<br />
Librarian spawns. He is on Brood of Kotiz/Legion of Cabilis faction and is quite possibly<br />
Kill on Sight to some without good faction in one or both of those.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, tortured librarian'<br />
<br />
tortured librarian says 'Bring to me that which was taken.'<br />
 <br />
Hand him the two books and it will result in:<br />
<br />
tortured librarian says 'All must be returned!'<br />
tortured librarian fades out of exisistence. The Air smells of death. Something has appeared in your hand.<br />
Your faction standing with Brood Of Kotiz got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Legion Of Cabilis got better.<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
The result is a Large Tassle Bookmark which identifies as a 'Tassel of Flaxen Cord'<br />
<br />
<br />
Speculation:<br />
The identify having 'Flaxen' in it looks like its part of the Flaxen Hilt quest in Cabilis West. It's likely that this is on of the items to be joined with the hilt.</div></div><hr />

I had mailed a copy of the quest to Allakhazam late last week (Thursday I think) when I solved it but didn't see it until now. It has the pictures of the two books, 'an Iksar tomb raider' (pic/level), and the Large Tassel Bookmark pic included in it. I had left the speculation part out because I can't prove it, but a couple things point that way.<br />
 <br />
Makes sense to keep the Before Green up for quite a while. Maybe if the Iksar Hermit's full quest gets solved it could all be combined but I don't see that happening soon. I will be trying but I don't spend much time in Droga where my next lead goes to.</div></div><hr />

I am fairly sure that the Large Tassel Bookmark and the 'A Yellow Whip' are two of the 4 items that go into the slots on the Flaxen hilt. I don't know what the other two are though. I suspect at least one is another unsolved quest reward, I don't know for sure though   There are at least 10 possible unsolved quests in kunark at the moment from years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Baadan</div><div class="date">09-25-02, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just checked magelo (b/c it lists the ID of items)<br />
<br />
and heres what I got:<br />
<br />
A Flaxen Hilt<br />
www.magelo.com/eq_item_in...?num=12887<br />
True name: A Flaxen Hilt <br />
<br />
<br />
A Yellow Whip<br />
www.magelo.com/eq_item_in...?num=12890<br />
True name: A Whip of Flaxen Cord <br />
<br />
and<br />
Large Tassel Bookmark<br />
www.magelo.com/eq_item_in...?num=12889<br />
True name: Tassel of Flaxen Cord <br />
<br />
Here is the discussion (about a rainbow whip(?) and a really buer bow (most likely all bogus tho)<br />
No &quot;flax&quot; stuff is on AllaKhazam's...only the Yellow Whip<br />
<br />
This is from a thread on EverLore:Quote: See, the farmers of the Karanas have been growing wheat for centuries since Veeshan bestowed this land upon them. The farmers have toiled day and night to grow their crops and to keep the Shadowknights and Necromancers away from their fields. A certain man named Josiah Macdonald resides on one of these farms(i forget which) and he takes a lot of pride in the crops that are grown there. His wife is a great tailor and her name is Emily macdonald. Josiah says that his wife is such a good tailor, that she even made a whip out of the tops of the wheat stalks. He wishes you to find this whip which turns out to be the Yellow Whip, and bring it back to him so he may make his wife happy and boost the morale of the farms in the Karanas.But no one can find those people...possibly the McMannus or Millers, tho no one has said what happened from turning into them.<br />
<br />
The Bow and Rainbow whip are 99% bogus, same for the farmer one, my guess is the flaxen iksar things.<br />
<br />
<br />
And btw...Quote: What is Flax?<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Flax is a blue flowering crop grown on the Prairies of Canada for its oil-rich seeds. The seeds of flax are tiny, smooth and flat, and range in colour from light to reddish brown. They serve a variety of purposes, including baking and other food uses.<br />
<br />
People have eaten flaxseed since ancient times. Taste — a pleasant, nutty flavour — is one reason. Good nutrition is another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xzzy</div><div class="date">09-25-02, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The librarian and the hermit in cabilis both have similar phrasing in their quest text.. the hermit says something along the lines of 'put within what was', the librarian says 'bring to me that which was taken'. The hilt you get is described to contain four slots in the top.<br />
<br />
Now the text itself isn't all that interesting, but the style suggests the same author for both.<br />
<br />
Having played an iksar necro for over two years now I've always had a passing interest in the cabilis necro quests, and in that period I've never heard of any item being found in game that referenced 'flaxen' besides that whip from dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Which yet again isn't all that interesting, but it does suggest that there's more obscure quest text to find and more weird drops to locate. Considering the level range of the mobs already involved (level 40 plus or minus 5 levels), it stands to reason the other two items will be found off similarily levelled mobs.<br />
<br />
Conclusion being, two NPC's need to be found that give queer requests about returning something that was lost, with no backstory given, and no pointers for where to hunt.<br />
<br />
Since the hilt isn't a container, it points to doing a combine somewhere. Since this is an iksar quest, and it appears that all iksar quests must eventually end at the forge in Dalnir, it stands to reason that the old haggle baron is yet again involved somehow.  <br />
<br />
Incidentially it doesn't seem at this point that it'll turn out to be some neat weapon or handheld. The text that the hermit gives you when you start the quest is that by returning the completed item, he will give you your sorcerer's cap. Which, oddly, is the last cap you get when finishing the 7th skullcap quest, so it may turn out this is just a shortcut to get through the necro quest chain (which by itself is odd because none of the other lizard classes get the same privilege).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sbik Luclin</div><div class="date">09-25-02, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote: Since the hilt isn't a container, it points to doing a combine somewhere.

<br />
There is a loom in Kaesora.  You might want to try combining them there.<br />
<br />
Also, there is a mob in Droga that is called a goblin stitcher or something like that.  He's a rare spawn near Chief Rukgus and the only drop he has is a note called Goblin Scribblings.  Identifying it gives something along the lines of 'a tail pattern' I think.  The goblin stitcher is about the same level as the other two you mentioned, so that could possibly be linked.  Then again, it could also be for some completely unrelated unsolved Kunark quest.  <br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does Kunark seem to have more unsolved quests than the other expansions?  There are quite a few oddities, like the ghost of the iksar admiral in the Outpost, the half elf maiden in the Haggle Baron's building in Cabilis, the rod you make in the Dalnir forge that has no known use, the brew barrel in City of Mist that has no known use, the oven in Temple of Droga that has no known use, the loom in Kaesora that has no known use, the erudite ghost in Field of Bone, and the strange &quot;crap&quot; drops from mobs in Howling Stones (dusty rusted shackles, etc.) all come to mind.</div></div><hr />

an iksar hermit hands you a flaxen hilt or handle of sorts. It has four round slots on one end. Insert within what used to be. Return it to me when all is complete. With it shall be your Sorcerer's Skullcap. Go and prove your knowledge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xzzy</div><div class="date">09-25-02, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at the prompting of another necro who poked around in magelo's database, he/we found this:<br />
<br />
You'll notice that the links given above are in series (almost). The three known items have these db numbers:<br />
<br />
12887, 12889, 12890.<br />
<br />
If you look at 12888, the item doesn't exist in magelo's db (ie, item never has been found or no one running magelo update has found it). Items 12885 and 12886 also don't exist in magelo's database.<br />
<br />
If you keep searching, items 12891, 12892, 12983 come up as &quot;a thin loch of hair&quot;, each identifying as strand one, two, and three of a &quot;pony tail&quot;. These hairs drop off a goblin canyoneer in Droga, just north of the warder area in the area with buildings on either sides of the rail tracks.<br />
<br />
12984 is unknown, and 12985 is the goblin scribblings that drop in the chief area in droga, that identifies as pattern for grakka's tail.<br />
<br />
So if one can assume for a moment that 12888 and 12984 are the other two items we need for this quest, that would pin the lochs of hair and the pattern as part of this quest.<br />
<br />
None of these items.. the tail pattern, or the hairs, have any known purpose that I can locate.  So until these items are verified as not part of this quest, or are found to have another purpose, it seems safe to assume that they are indeed related to this quest.<br />
<br />
My guess is that item 12888 will become the three hairs somehow combined into a cord of some sort. My last guess (which I admit is a bit of a stretch so be forgiving) is that grakka's tail is somehow meant to be the fourth cord, and will end up  being item 12984.<br />
<br />
As an aside, if you poke around with google and search for the words flaxen, pony, and tail, you'll find a number of examples describing real pony tails as flaxen in color. Just serves as confirmation that these hairs could indeed be what is sought.<br />
<br />
Grakka's tail needs more research. There's a wealth of information in kunark about an iksar with a mechanical tail, which I'll have to hunt around in game to find. <br />
<br />
It's also just as likely that item 12984 is a single drop from somewhere else in the game. Only hole with this &quot;quest item numbers in series&quot; is that the books the original poster found to get the tassel don't fit into the series. I didn't have the patience to hunt through magelo to find out where they actually are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xzzy</div><div class="date">09-25-02, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt; With it shall be your Sorcerer's Skullcap. <br />
<br />
Ah yes there was some debate about this line as well.<br />
<br />
The sorcerer's skullcap is the item recieved when a necro finishes the 7th quest in the series. Necros have debated two iterpretations for this line.. they say that either the hermit is claiming you will recieve your sorcerer's skullcap, or when you return the completed flaxan hilt and your sorcerer's skullcap, you will get a new undiscovered reward.<br />
<br />
The negative faction hit is interesting because of some of the lore surrounding the cabilis necro guild. Way back when, there was a necro who started looking into the other schools of magic and started to make a super weapon with his new knowledge. He began to create this weapon, but was caught before he could complete it.  Incidentially the part of the weapon he completed was the visceral dagger from dalnir. Said unlucky necro was from what I recall, killed in some painful fashion and forgotten. If you ask the necro guild master about the dagger, he throws a fit and tells you to stop asking about it.<br />
<br />
Tying this into the hermit, it seems possible that this is either that same necro from before, or a second necro who is looking into the forbidden schools of magic. As as aside, if anyone has read up on Miragul, this is kind of a mirror story to what the erudites went through. The implication at the end of all this is that a necro who learns to harness the powers of the other schools of magic will be outcast from cabilis, yet will earn lots of yummy power for doing it.<br />
<br />
Thus explaining the negative faction hit for helping this hermit. The visceral dagger does NOT appear to be related to this quest however, as other necros have exhaustively (and i mean exhaustively) researched that possibility. Smaug over on everlore.com has pages of discussion about his efforts to solve this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vanidor Silverbranch</div><div class="date">09-25-02, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also of the opinion that the 3 hairs are part of the quest. I have my own kind of database I have made up after doing tons of kunark quests and taking magelo numbers. Here is the sections in particular. Format is number, name, (Identification) (notes). I added a bit before it and after.<br />
<br />
12884 Fine Steel Rapier (Gunthak pirate rapier) (off any pirate in FV)<br />
12885 *<br />
12886 *<br />
12887 A Flaxen Hilt (A Flaxen Hilt) (given by Iksar Hermit in West Cabilis)<br />
12888 *<br />
12889 Large Tassel Bookmark (Tassel of Flaxen Cord) (quest in Kaesora)<br />
12890 A Yellow Whip (A Whip of Flaxen Cord) (drops in DL off named Drolvarg)<br />
12891 A thin loch of Hair (Strand 1 of Pony Tail)<br />
12892 A thin loch of Hair (Strand 2 of Pony Tail) (drops from goblin canyoneer)<br />
12893 A thin loch of Hair (Strand 3 of Pony Tail)<br />
12894 *guessing a Pony Tail or reward for handing them in<br />
12895 Goblin Scribblings (Pattern for Grakka's Tail) (drops from goblin stitcher)<br />
12896 A Ruby (The Blood of Sebilis) (warrior quest)<br />
12897 Canyoneer Pike (same) (droga drop, level 5 proc, 10% slow)<br />
<br />
18068 Before Green (Scribed by Glomox) (quest from OT bookseller, Dom K'Perl)<br />
18069 Venril the Chief (Scribed by Glomox) (dropped from an Iksar Tome Raider in EJ) <br />
<br />
My current theory is that 12888 is a reward for another sub quest. That 12894 is the combined 3 strands, or a reward for giving them to someone. And that 12888, 12889, 12890, 12894 plus the hilt and the pattern combine to make the final item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've not been able to farm the three lochs of hair yet (stupid vt raids) but if the hair + pattern idea doesn't work i'll try lots of different combines.<br />
<br />
I did get my guild to confirm the spawn location of the canyoneer. As you enter the region with the the rails (after leaving the warder area, going under the bridge, then the small tunnel), you come into a room with a bridge above your head, and a series of buildings on either side of the hall.<br />
<br />
The canyoneer is a confirmed spawn in the left building.. sounds like your basic clearing PH's until he pops situation. But at least droga has a nice fast respawn rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more like a recipie, like smithing. The hilt you get has four slots in it. You put four things (cords, apparently) into the slots.<br />
<br />
In game terms, you put all 5 items (at least) into a container, hit combine, and get the finished product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This fits with the spawning system for droga. Most &quot;nameds&quot; tend to spawn in a specific region, random within that region.<br />
<br />
Most report him spawning where I described him. It's also likely he spawns in less frequented parts of the zone.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Grakka's tail needs more research. There's a wealth of information in kunark about an iksar with a mechanical tail, which I'll have to hunt around in game to find. &quot;<br />
<br />
I had the mechanical tail once and destroyed it about a year ago. It was a quest using very odd drops off of Brutes  in FM. Some sort of jawbones (memory hazy but was something like Pygmy Brute Jaw) that you gave to the guy in FV who spawned up on the mound of dirt over near Swamp of No Hope. Same guy used for one of the Iksar Shackles quests<br />
<br />
Wait a sec, let me go find the quest,,,<br />
<br />
Here we go,,,<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Kwinn's Quest (Normal): Kwinn the Outlander (a rare spawn barbarian who wanders all over the zone) has a quest for you. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Kwinn the Outlander' <br />
<br />
Kwinn the Outlander says 'Hail, adventurer! Kwinn's the name. Hunting is my game. I have been all over this continent. Seen many things and found [odd trinkets]. I have no quarrel with any race. I judge a person or critter by their actions. Heck, my best friend is a troll !! <br />
<br />
You say, 'Wwhat odd trinkets?' <br />
<br />
Kwinn the Outlander says 'Blast!! I found some strange thingamajigs!! Most of it I toss or sell to vendors and crazy sages. I am on my way to sell this  to a tinkerer. <br />
<br />
You say, 'What iron tail?' <br />
<br />
Kwinn the Outlander says 'Found the thing washed up on the shore in Timorous Deep. Looks like a metal lizardman tail. It is all rusted and covered with barnacles. Probably can't get much for it, but I'll try. Why do you ask? Are you looking to [trade for the mechanical thing]? <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am looking to trade for the mechanical thing' <br />
<br />
Kwinn the Outlander takes out an extra pack. 'Thought you might be interested. I don't want to take a loss and I only trade for things I am hunting, so here!! Inside this pack you need to combine the following items; a sabertooth tiger mane, a pair of pygmy brute choppers, a lime plume and a war bone fist. Return the full sack to me and the tail is yours.' <br />
<br />
Kwinn the Outlander says 'Kackling Quellious!! This will bring a fortune on the black market!! Well, a deal is a deal. Here is the tail. Reward: A Mechanical Iksar Tail.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The tail has/had(?) no known use and bank spare is a premium so it went bye bye after collecting dust.<br />

<br />
There's a couple of things here that don't make sense to me as an anal-retentive Troll:<br />
<br />
1) What's the logic in having to kill Kwinn for the Shackle of Copper quest and then go to the same guy later on to do a quest for him to get the tail?  I know that he has no faction.  That's beside the point.<br />
<br />
2) The Tomekeeper is level 41 or so and on a very fast spawn cycle, thus giving a bit of experience to bored level 59 SKs who are waiting for a certain Failed Cryptraider to spawn.  The Tomekeeper has no faction.  Should logically be on Swifttails faction (Iksar Monks) in same way that the Tortured Librarian (same room) is on Brood Kotiz faction (Iksar Necro).  Hey..I don't mind getting the xp..  but I want things to make sense!<br />

Handle and multiple thongs/tails usually fitted with hooks or barbs to flay the skin off of those it was used against.  The descriptions of these I have seen usually involve 3-4 thongs because of the tendency to get caught up in itself with more than that.  Used as more of a torture device than an actual weapon, it kind of fits within the line of thought of a necromancer weapon.  Honestly, if this was implemented I would truly love making the iksar necro I have been putting off for a while.</div></div><hr />

See, there's some odd iconsistencies [sic] going on here. The goblin scribblings are for Grakka's tail. Upon researching, I (re)learned that the tail Qwinn gives you is for Vlzk Irontail, an ancient iksar hero who was killed at sea when Trakanon was sent by the Ring of Scale to destroy the iksar navy. The tail you recieve from Qwinn would fit this information because he said he found it washed in from the sea.<br />
<br />
One of the books you can purchase in Cabilis talks about this guy's tail and his subsequent demise.<br />
<br />
I have no idea who Grakka is, the only place I've ever seen his name is in the lore text from the goblin scribblings found in Droga. The wisdom of google has shown no insights, either.</div></div><hr />

The cook drops a lore no drop container that looks like a mask.

I posted a few of the combines I tried on the allakhazam thread. My account is Morigu there (Vanidor and Jhereg were both taken I think). Verant once said that all items to do that quest were fixed and in game, however I still haven't seen anyone manage it. The only theories I have are 1) you need to do something with the tongue, 2) maybe the skeletal cook would say something if you charm him, or maybe hand him the scroll or something. Beyond those ideas I am stumped on that quest.</div></div><hr />

The next item is unknown and most likely the 4th missing quest item, following that is the dried tongue, and then another missing item, which is most likly the quest reward. The skull container shows up in a diferent part of the database as it is a container. So from this information id say that the tongue is currently the item needed, because if it needed a mini quest to modify it, like the preserved eyes, it would be in position 12398, not 12399. So from this info we can assume we have 3 of the needed components and are missing just one to complete this quest. The skull of torture is used in a shadowknight quest so item 12400 must be the final quest reward item. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xzzy</div><div class="date">10-08-02, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A segment of the quest text for the canopic guy reads thusly:<br />
<br />
&quot;Galdon Vok Nir says 'Kurn's Tower!! Such a dangerous place for <br />
one to wander. It is a place of great suffering. Kurn was well known for the torture of many races, mostly the giants named the Kromdul. Long after the destruction of the tower by an unknown foe, the Kromdul returned to retrieve Kurn's body for sacrifice to their gods. They did not find his body, but rumor has it they found Kurn's favorite torture weapon. What happened to it, only they would know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since we've deduced that we're trying to recreate a torture device, this small bit of text seems to be the &quot;missing link&quot; that, instead of forcing us to run around blindly, gives us hints on what we're looking for to complete the hermit's quest.<br />
<br />
The question that remains, then, is to find out what giant we have to deal with to get either the hints needed or the fourth piece of the sceptre. <br />
<br />
The text would indicate we want to deal only with giants who live in wooded areas, or more specifically any forest giants (kromdul is the faction associated with the forest giants ). This discounts both dreadlands and frontier mountains. WW and BW seem the most likely candidates, plus the small giant camp in FV.<br />
<br />
BW giants have the most interesting loot tables. BW also has the named giant, which is the only named forest giant that I know of. Perhaps he should be charmed and hailed? I scoured loot tables on allakhazam's and found nothing obvious, though the ***** spun belt would fit in with the rest of the items (***** is flaxen in color). Problem being the belt has no lore text associated with it.<br />
<br />
Though I'm betting some giant somewhere has quest text that will be discovered instead, telling us how to assemble kurn's torture device, which will turn out to be the item the iksar hermit wants.<br />
<br />
As an aside.. is the canopic dropped in droga the fourth item for the kurn's mask quest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The giant covers his pouch to keep it from jumping out&quot;. <br />
&quot;hey scumsuker you wont get my loot!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rumor suggests he's a place holder for some mob for a shadow knight quest, but I haven't been able to find any confirmation that this is in fact the case.<br />
<br />
Maybe he's worth charming and hailing as well?</div></div><hr />

<br />
flaxen being the wheat as well as the colour blonde. <br />
<br />
And on top of this being a necro quest the way it looks, an item used to cut down flax-wheat looks like a scythe, a handle, some cords, a blade and a longer stick-part.<br />
<br />
I could also think there is an item to beat flax with to actually get the seeds out of their enclosing, bit far fetched, the item used to &quot;skin&quot; seems much likelier a necro item)<br />

<br />
At first I thought the iksar hermit somehow checked your inventory when you say 'I'm a great sorcerer'. Before he'd send me off with lowered faction. Which would make sense; I mean you're lying to the guy after all heh. Since getting the skullcap, my faction goes up, which is logical. Of course, I've since learned other classes also get higher faction from him, so it must have something to do with level and/or current faction, not actually having the skullcap. <br />
<br />
I've seriously pondered putting long hours into this quest, being curious about it and did some poking around. But the exact wording of it just seems to point to it granting you the sorcerer skullcap.  I can't see any other logical way of explaining it. Would it make sense for it to be a shortcut to the seventh skullcap and nothing else? Up to now I've left it at that theory. But I'll still come poke my snout here from time to time, and will gladly try out ideas you might have. <br />
<br />
I have a few friends well versed in Iksar lore; i'll ask them what they think of what you've come up with so far. Oh and as always I'll keep an eye out for flaxen anything and identify odd items.<br />
<br />
There is also a quest given by one of the Keepers in the Grotto that, to my knowledge is unsolved. Something about stolen pages. I'll try to dig up my info on that again.<br />
<br />
Good luck and great work up to now! I admit I'm glad to hear of progress on this old mystery. Bah you guys are making me want to give this quest another shot      <br />

The forest giant in warsliks woods when aggro'd spawns an iksar shadowknight by the zone to cabilis.  10 minutes after being hailed he runs into the forest and spawns an obsidian hilt, which id's as an obsidian hilt.

I know that Kerosh Blackhand, the named bandit in the Field of Bone (inside the Marauder caves) drops one everytime.  And I belive that they also drop in City of Mist.  The Fine Steele Ulak was belived to be a key to the doors in CoM, I have no idea if that theory was proven, or disproven.</div></div><hr />

The Barbed Scale Whip used to drop in FM but from what I understand it was taken out of the game due to the low delay (4/11).<br />
<br />
Is the Barbed Scaled Whip the final result of this quest, or is it a replacement item for the Barbed Scale Whip which no longer drops, or is there some confusion on spelling somewhere?</div></div><hr />

The items i have listed are not someone elses speculation, they are as they are listed in that order in the data file i was looking at. The (Drops?) was a question as to if it actually drops right now as the person that had hunted the lochs of hair a lot had never seen a fourth thread. I have not been able to really link any of the items in game so I do not know what their screenshots would look like.<br />

<br />
Provided you know the name and number of an item you can link things though your ini file. The name has to be exact though you can try variations and various numbers for a name.<br />

I would be very interested if you had the items for these numbers since they aren't in magelo and are associated with unsolved(on various boards) kunark quests:<br />

I'm not sure if you have any of those, or are interested in discussing them. But they are nearby various unsolved quests and I thought I would ask. If your curious about it btw, just look at items on either side of the above on magelo (use their inventory feature with numbers).</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 x Zombie Flesh<br />
1 Bixie Honeycomb<br />
1 Salt Minnow<br />
Combine in Oven<br />
<br />
Result should be Jerky also known as Honey Flesh. Honey Flesh is mentioned in the note that the Undead Jester drops in Kurns.<br />
<br />
The Salt Minnow has never been seen in the game. I suspect that it is supposed to be fished in FV. I base this on the fact that the water there is an ocean - salt - and the fish that are currently caught there are the same as from Cabilis. The Cabilis waterways are part of the sewer system for the city and should be freshwater. Sewer Catfish and such that are caught in Cabilis make sense. Catching a Sewer Catfish in FV does not make much sense but I can't prove it is incorrect.<br />

The other items I basically have no knowledge of why they are that way:<br />
<br />
Blood ink quest, east cabilis (the red globules)<br />
Kurn's Jerky Delight/Salt Minnow, kurn skeletal cook quest<br />
Pickled Froglok Eye, guessing a hidden tradeskill quest<br />
<br />
Vague references:<br />
Ceramic Stein - read it drops off Lenka Stouthart in FV<br />
Scribblings (Sorcerer Scribblings) - BW Entalon charm quest?<br />
Glowing Blade (same) - unknown but possibly off pilgrims like Scribblings are supposed to be<br />

A key - used somehow in Half Elf Maiden quest in East Cabilis<br />

Anyways, the recipie for the Jerky came from book text I have. I don't know where it comes from but it seems like something that the Cook should have dropped but isn't. I have killed the Cook at least a couple dozen times while camping the Fingered skeleton and have never seen a book drop from him. I have never killed the mob that drops the canopics though, I am not even sure where he spawns.<br />

<br />
Let me give you a rough history.<br />
<br />
Originally, I started working on this quest quite a while ago.  A little over 2 years ago, to be exact, really almost since Kunark was released.  <br />
<br />
I first contacted Verant about it sometime before Velious was released.  I was assured that there was going to be a committee formed and that all the iksar quests would be fixed sometime in the first 2 quarters of 2001.  Well I continued to check on it past the release of Velious and kept hearing the same thing.  I eventually gave up for a while.<br />
<br />
Sometime in the summer, a GM started working on the shadowknight version of these quests and posted openly about it in the testing forums.  After he fixed a small amout of the shadowknight one, he disappeared never to be seen again.  (Witness protection program I think).  It gave me a bit of hope that they would start fixing all the quests, but it got put on a back burner til late in that year.  Out of the blue they fixed the shadowknight one.  Then went back to sleep til after Luclin was released.  Several months after Luclin was released, they fixed the monk one and then the shaman one almost in the same month.  Once again I was hopeful, but once again it was put on a back burner.  <br />
<br />
All during this time, I was assurred that they would be getting to it shortly.  I went as far as asking directly to the testing department head if I was going to have to wait for another expansion for this to get fixed.  Mr. Araiza who answered me told me that he was certain this would get fixed far before the next expansion.  Well that was last summer.  I have recently asked Mr. Hartsman and the new lead tester, Mr. Lamp.  Mr. Hartsman told me several months ago that this would be solved as soon as the issues with PoP were fixed.  Well they are now working on a new expansion and have long finished really dealing with the big issues of PoP.  And yet no changes have been made.  They even went as far as fixing link altering.  Why couldnt they have fixed the problem that caused people to start trying to alter links?  Mr.  Lamp has told me that Verant only determined there was a problem with the Hermit Quest back in September.  Well why was Mr. Araiza telling me that it was broken all this time.  That is pretty good, most have known it was broken since 2000, you guys are just figuring it out, you all are right on top of things.  Mr.  Lamp also told me that the changes to the Hermit would not require a patch of the zone, so why hasn't then been fixed?  Its not like it takes a big deal of time to change the text of a specific NPC.  Hell I have seen them put NPCs in to fix little problems for a short time that would require more work.  Giving Mr. Lamp some credit though, he did report the quest broken and exactly how it was broken, as soon as I made him aware of it.  That is more than Araiza did in 2 years.  <br />
<br />
So as you can see, I think Verant cares little about making a well working product, only that you continue to play and pay.  They have lied about these quests for so long, I don’t even they know what is going on.  This quest will probably never be fixed.  Along with many of the other iksar ones, unless someone happens to stumble on the missing parts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I personally have only gone as far as completing up to most of the 7th quest just before you got you're 7th helm.. at that point I saw little use to continue on.<br />
<br />
Now with this info listed in this thread, I believe I understand what needs to be done, but we're still missing parts.<br />
<br />
1.  We need to find if/where the fourth loch of hair (item #12894) drops.  I suspect it's likely not dropping, but since all the other lochs of hair drop in droga I suspect it's supposed to drop here as well.<br />
<br />
2. Once found, combining the 4 strands of hair and the pattern (item #12895), in what I am unsure, should in theory result in the Flaxen Lock of Hair (item #12888) .<br />
<br />
3. This then combines with the Flaxen Hilt (item #12887), Large Tassel Bookmark (item #12889), A Yellow Whip (item #12890)<br />
<br />
Only problem I see is there the quest text says there are 4 holes on the hilt, and the string of ID'd items around the hilt only show 3 items that really fit..  so who knows, this whole quest is prolly fubar'd<br />
<br />
edit: keep forgeting the custom sig's are turned off..<br />

YAY!  you are now the   of all necros with your nifty new hat! assuming im right o course .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sedory Wyldeflower</div><div class="date">01-20-03, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the only problem I see with that idea is the lack of a connection between the skull quest and the hermit quest.  At the least the yellow whip and flaxen bookmark have ID numbers close to the hilt that they make sense, but I just don't see a connection yet for the skull quest.<br />
<br />
I believe we'll need to fine the 4 loch of hair to continue on, combine all the hairs and pattern, and use the resulting item in a combine with the hilt, whip, bookmark, and tail.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's only 3 items + hilt, but I don't see anything else.. wouldn't be the first time VI messed up quest text.<br />

<br />
1) There are two forest giants (Kromdul) at the end of mine in the mountain giant (Kromdek) fort in FM. They are on beta neutral faction, they are named, respond to hail with unfriendly one liners, are not related to any quests I can think of and drop and say nothing when killed. Asking them about flaxen and about kurn's torture weapon resulted in nothing.<br />
<br />
2) I remember that the Drolvag that has the flaxen whip has an agro message (pretty damn rare for kunark). It is something like of &quot;Unlike the other drolvargs, this one seems able to speak&quot;. Maybe charming him and hailing him can result in something interesting.<br />
<br />
3) The hilt do have 4 holes according to the quest text when the item is received. The hermit hands the hilt back when it is given to him, so, obviously, it needs to be combined with other items first, not just handed with these other items.<br />
Note that looking at the IDs only 3 items are near the hilt (the cord made out of the 4 hair lock, the drolvarg whip and the bookmark). Maybe the 4th item allready existed in the database when the quest was made? And old world item maybe or a regular drop that was not primarly ment to be used in this quest?</div></div><hr />

The skull, 2 canipics, and tongue are for some unsolved quest from kurn's tower, the undead jester drops a note that says something about kurns victim's skull has some power once the tongue and eyes are restored, the burynai forager drops 2 dusty sealed canopic(size:small) the tongue(size:tiny), and the glowing skull is off the skeletal cook and is limited to tiny objects, always assumed the quest was broken due to the canopics containing eyes where too large for the skull and no one could figure out how to get the eyes opened to fit into the skull.</div></div><hr />

I've scoured Droga and often get the TLC message, and wonder what item I've just lost. I've tried to find random NPCs that might be interested in lochs of hair.<br />
<br />
I am really intrigued by this quest but I don't want to start a char on another server just for this. So unless I want to spend a fortune paying lower level people to go dig around (ie get killed) in Droga for me, I seem stuck. I'll keep looking for odd drops or NPCs though. <br />
<br />
Bah so much time spent on a quest that as Smauug said might just be unsolvable as it is. I'll stick to my sorcerer skullcap I suppose.<br />

So far i feel the 8th cap may not be the final one. As compare to sk, monk and shammy quest, the  components for the final rank are all from the high level dungeons like HS, Chardok. etc</div></div><hr />

OT is on VS faction, so it seems the note should be delieved to someone in OT, Korucust seems a spy of Iksar in chardok<br />
<br />
In royal, the prince drops &quot;Korucust's report on Vrasyk&quot; written in Dragon<br />
My liege and fellow servants of Di'zok<br />
After serveral weeks of surveillance, i was able to discover the true nature of council member Ka'jiq. This person and serveral others were agents put in place by the Ring of Scale. Ka'jiq's true name was Vrasyk, a creature capable of changing its shape to match that of our own. The couriers and other attendants that he employed appeared to be of a similar background. Those creatures were dispatched as well.<br />
Please remember that this sort of treachery is completely within the power of the foul brood that seeks to manipulate us.<br />
There is only one way to find all of the traitors within our ranks. I will need the full authority of the council and family DI'zok to flush out this filth<br />

<br />
There is a traitor sarnak pop in korucust room every 20-30 mins and once pop will be killed by golem in secs<br />
<br />
I suspect these may have a link to the end part of iksar nec hermit quest as Venril S is the lich king of iksar kingdom. however, i hope this quest may not involve the VP zone, as VP needs a very nasty key to enter. i ve heard Korucust's courier also drops a note to Phar Dar</div></div><hr />

Maybe the necro would whip themselves with it in a ritual to gain mana - ie the effect would be a hp / mana conversion like the Lich line (early ones I mean). Like that necro book you make in Temple of Solusek Ro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though you can get a negative faction hit for answering &quot;i am a great sorcerer&quot; and a positive faction hit for answerings &quot;i am not a great sorcerer&quot; it seems to depend on circumstances<br />
<br />
e.g. when i was 50+ (cant remember exact level) and had my sorcerer skullcap, i asnwered &quot;i am a great sorcerer&quot; and got a positive hit and the hilt<br />
<br />
EDIT: Hmmmm, just been looking in Magelo's database, just doing sequencial numbers, some of the items either side of the Venril the Chief and Before Green books are also No Rent books that can be bought in Cabilis:<br />
<br />
18064- Captain of the Sea- True name: Life of Captain Irontail (a book bought in Cabilis, however this one is no rent)<br />
18065- A Journal- True name: Tagrazz's Journal (not sure if related, anyone ever heard of Tagrazz before?)<br />
18066- a tattered note- True name: memo to the keepmaster (not ringing bells here, anyone come across this and knows where it drops? Keepmaster -sounds- kinda like something that spawns in Chardok)<br />
18067- a tattered memo- True name: Revenant Vytrix  (/boggle, apparently its a book, because of the &quot;the book is closed&quot; bit on item, but the true name is kinda confusing. This also seems to be an item out of chardok, since sarnaks can be called revenant and iksar SKs are called crusaders instead)<br />
18068- Before Green, already established<br />
18069- Venril the Chief, already established<br />
18070- No Item<br />
18071- &quot;<br />
18072- Legionnaire Recommendation, True Name: Woods Garrison<br />
18073- Legionnaire Recommendation, True Name: Swmap Garrison<br />
18074- Legionnaire Recommendation, True Name: Lake Garrison<br />
18075- No Item (Though at i guess, i reckon its the Field Garrison or something LEgionnaire Recommendation)<br />
18076- blood soaked note- True name: wood elf note (something relating to wood elf madien in Cabilis? no drop, lore, no rent book)<br />
18077- Talon Southpaw- True name: Scribed by Rinmark (another no rent version of a book bought in Cabilis)<br />
18078- Genesis of Fist and Tail- True name: Scribed by Vezkar (another book bought in Cabilis, no rent version)<br />
<br />
Im not sure what the legionnaire recommendation's are for, nor if they are related.<br />
However, what we do have is three other tomes which are no rent versions of ones bought in various parts of Cabilis, and perhaps, some of the no items preceeding item 18064 are other versions /shurg.<br />
<br />
Also, what we have of the 5 books so far is this<br />
Venril the Chief and Before Green- Books relating to the iksar rise up and a main figure involving it (necromancer records?)<br />
Talon Southpaw and Genesis of Fist and Tail- books of the creation of the monks and a noteable monk among then (caught by the iksar, Chardok related? But definately monk records)<br />
Captain of the Sea- an noteable iksar warrior, and my guess is that 18063 is the book relating to warriors of iksar, following the pattern<br />
<br />
<br />
Item 18055 was the first after a long line of no items, and its Crusage of 1216 A.G, but its not a no rent book, only lore<br />
Item 18054 was a book called Bone Garrison, not sure what that is either, was -not- no rent.<br />
<br />
I know there are some things which seem of little relevance here, but they seem to have some signficance to me, some seem to indicate Chardok entering the quest quite heavily, and also relating to the wood elf madien in East Cab.<br />
Has anyone ever found a key to her room/ gotten a rogue to pick it?<br />
<br />
Anyhew, i hope this helps and im not regurgitating what tohers have said already<br />

The Iksar Empire of Cabilis is led by Emperor Vekin, who is not ingame but is mentioned by several cabilis NPCs, and was the guy you made the sceptre for in the last skullcap quest.<br />
<br />
Venril Sathir was the original Emperor of the Iksar Empire, but was killed by his son, Rile Sathir (wielder of Greenmist) after selling his soul to Innoruuk in return for immortality.  Venril was then resurrected by his cult of followers and his wife, Drusella Sathir.  Now he leads the Drolvargs among others from Karnor's Castle in the name of Innoruuk, and is opposed to the Cazic-Thule worshipping Empire of Cabilis.</div></div><hr />

These items are part of the last known Iksar Warrior pike quests. You need to various quests for the Warlords of the 3 garrisons to give you a recommendation to become a Legionnaire. Rough quest to do and next quest after Legionnaire's Mancatcher is unknown and most likely unimplimented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
His text seems to be changed too:<br />
<br />
'Hail, an Iksar hermit'<br />
an Iksar hermit looks at you with one good eye.  His left eye is covered with pus.  'I seek a [great sorcerer].'<br />
'I am a great sorcerer'<br />
Your faction standing with Brood Of Kotiz got better.<br />
an Iksar hermit hands you a flaxen hilt or handle of sorts.  It has four round slots on one end.  'Insert within what used to be.  Return it to me when all is complete.  With it shall you gain your Sorcerer's Skullcap.  Go and prove your knowledge.'<br />
<br />
So, now we know where to do the combine... I bet some of the other bits for the quest are also now dropping now.  <br />
<br />
BUT... the text says 'With it shall you gain your Sorcerer's Skullcap&quot; -- seems to suggest this is an alternate route to the 7th skullcap -- whaaa!! Why would Verant go to the trouble to make two quests (quite complicated ones at that) that yield the same reward??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Smaaug</div><div class="date">03-04-03, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well one down several to go:<br />
<br />
Hollow Skull<br />
First the Hollow Skull quest, from what I can see on this quest looks like one of two routes.  Either the skull of torture is suppose to go into the container and is just the wrong size or we need to actually look for the Salt Minnow.<br />
<br />
I have one problem with the Salt Minnow though, its source is note that has only seemed to drop on the test server.  I can't find one person that, definitely has even seen it.  I found one database the recipe is in, but that database encoupasses anything and everything, regardless if it is an item that has only been dropped once, or placed in the game but never implemented to drop.  My guess, the quest is broken, there is no salt minnow and there is no recipe that ever made it to a live server.  I will try to confirm this, but my suggestion is to submit it to your favorite GM and or bug department.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Crusader Golin<br />
Here is another one that has a good chance of being broken.  Couple of thoughts on him though.  There is a Trooper Nodfod in SoNH, perhaps you should see him and see if he has his old adventure buddies broken weapon aka Shattered Khurki.  Regardless, he maybe a good source of information.  I would suggest bringing the notes from Dalnir.<br />
<br />
The weapon is not dropping in Dalnir, so unless its not dropping it all, someone has to have it.  Since Nodfod went with him, he would be an ideal choice. <br />
<br />
Another lead on him would be the iksar knight in WW, its adjacent to Dalnir and he digs up an item called the obsidian Hilt.  Dont know if that is related but you might want to check that out for leads.  A side note on the obsidian hilt.  There are 3 items on Norrath with the same effect as the hilt, 2 of them are similar in stats, shards, and lore items.  One is not.  Perhaps there is another item that needs to be combined together? (consult eqwab)<br />
<br />
Another person to check would be the guy that Nodfod said would torture him if he returned without the visceral dagger.  His name escapes me at the moment.<br />
<br />
From the lore it appears Golin died on the second floor of Dalnir (in the crypt room) which is where his parts can be found.  All but his weapon, so either its not droppin or Nodfod took it with him.  It never talked about Nodfod dying, so either he died and they didn't talk about it, he was captured either by the Kly (coerced Smith) or the Giants (iksar Knight), or he made it back to Cabilis and was punished by being ejected from his guild and made to serve as a warrior in the Swamp.  If Nodfod used it and died, then it would be dropping on the third floor somewhere, if he was captured by the Kly they might have put him to work on the forge, but he had no previous knowledge of the forge so why would they keep him to work on it.  If he is the iksar knight then why doesnt he complete his task, why did he bury a shard in the woods and then run off in the wrong direction from Cabilis, unless he was suppose to go insane, which is a possibility.  Looks to me that the SoNH is the best choice for avenues of approach.  One of these have to be the case.  <br />
<br />
Keeper Rotts notes<br />
Confirmed Broken<br />
<br />
Grand Necro SkullCap (#9 Iksar nec Skullcap)<br />
So far finding this quest seems to be the quest, I dont really have anything on it yet.  Kinda guessing that the Golin quest is going to lend some insight on this one.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work, lets not let the unsolved quests go just because the Hermit has been conquered.  There is much left to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Id suggest trying to fish in the pool in front of Bargryn inside Kurns.<br />
<br />
Blood globules listed on those lists earlier used to drop the first 3 weeks of Kunark in Swamp of No Hope, but mosquito wings didnt, they fixed the wings, and the blood globules stopped.<br />
<br />
Foobscle Coif is reward for Foobs Sammich quest, all parts are known except the recipie for Honey mush bread, never been found yet.<br />

Having been on all these quests from day one, its sad we had to beat SOE/VI for so long to fix the quests we have reported over and over as being broken.<br />
<br />
Ive had this hollow skull and eyes and tongue for over 2 years now in  my bank. Its a matter of honor at this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
-rant on<br />
<br />
And yes it really did rub those of us working on the shaman quests iksar for the cudgel, wrong , when after 9 months of pushing to fix drops and investigating clues, that the item reward was opened to all/all. nice item, but it completely removed the sense of Pride those of us  who spent such dutiful time on hunting them. now its just another phat loot drop for other races to run in and camp in a week with no thought. :/<br />
<br />
-rant off<br />
 <br />
<br />
Lets see if we can finish some more of these long &quot;lost quets items&quot; the dagger that id: ZOK  that the iksar knight digs up and hands you is another long mystery.<br />

From reading the first page of this thread I can tell you there the Goblin Canyoneer and goblin stitcher are gone with the Droga revamp.<br />
<br />
The goblin cayoneer used to spawn in the tunnel that leads to zone out in Droga. Just past the &quot;village&quot; area where the goblin warder used to spawn you will find some more buildings build into the wall on the left and right. That is where i killed him before.<br />
<br />
Goblin stitcher did indeed spawn in a little cubby room right outside of the chief's room in droga. That mob is replaced by &quot;a goblin food supplier&quot;. He drops a piece for a walk type event i believe.<br />
<br />
The revamp has prolly broken this quest so start your feedback and bug reports now</div></div><hr />

Perhaps some unimplemented part or a quest that Verant never finished.<br />

A weapon is now dropping in Dalnir, I am currently investigating this and hopefully will have results soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Found this item in Dalnir<br />
<br />
Drops of the Kly Overseer ( has killed him twice and both times he had it ). It looks like some sort of weird weapon when he carries it and a scimitar icon in inventory view. <br />
<br />
I had no idea on the spawn time as he was up both times I was there.<br />
<br />
Item<br />
<br />
Shattered Crusader Khukri<br />
<br />
Magic Lore<br />
Slot : Primary <br />
1 Hand Slashing<br />
Atk 5 Dly 27<br />
Size : Medium<br />
Class : SHD<br />
Race : ALL<br />
<br />
When identified the lore says<br />
<br />
Item Lore : Property of Golin<br />
<br />
It is indeed tradeable. Edited by: Decad at: 1/26/04 10:20 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">01-26-04, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">everquest.allakhazam.com/...quest=2177 is the glowing skull quest. You combine bone chips + 2x zombie flesh (from the rotting flesh hunters) + salt minnow (fished in Cabilis and/or FV) inside the hollow skull to get Kurn's Jerky Delight. Combine the jerky, two eyes, and the tongue inside the skull (you get it back from the first combine) to get the NoRent glowing skull. Hand the glowing skull to the skeletel cook, and he gives you The Skull of Torture. However, some mobs in Kurn's now drop the glowing skull, so you simply have to hand it in.<br />
<br />
From the comments, it seems this was recently revamped. The rotting flesh hunters seem to have been put in with the 10-10-03 patch.<br />
<br />
Quote:The canopics are no longer a step in the quest. The mobs now drop the preserved eyes.<br />
<br />
The skull is now medium-sized, to fit the larger food items.<br />
<br />
That seems to cover some of the problems people had before.</div></div><hr />
