<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bargle13</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well they say that the third times a charm... I rerolled my SB last night, and got him to lvl 5, selected SB, and am rdy to rock. The question is how do I spec this guy.<br />
<br />
I already know that I am not going to spec Left Axe. I may carry a 2 handed set for the extra damage, and possibly for a double envenom. I am planning on auto-training Stealth till like 32 which should get me to LvL 8.<br />
<br />
The question is Main Main Wep/CS/Stealth. I was planning on going swords as they tend to be faster weapons, and there are some nice sword drops for high lvl SB's.<br />
<br />
Here was my original thoughs regarding my spec. Max Sword, and CS, let Stealth Auto till 32 then Train it up. The big question is envenom.<br />
<br />
It looks like anything in CS above 39 seems wasted other than for the bonus because the higher lvl Spec's are part of a rather long chain. I dont think that anything but a tank is gonna last that long against a SB.<br />
<br />
Sword spec seems similar to CS except for Ragnorok which gives a bonus from behind good for a SB no?<br />
<br />
Stealth I have read is important to keep up close to your lvl either though spec, or through items. The only benefits of the higher spec is the safe fall ability. Ok, what lvl of safefall is best for jumping off the walls one of the keeps say? Guess that would help me decide on how high this should go (other than the reasons stated above).<br />
<br />
Envenom, now this is the great unknown, I have read about the MASSIVE damage that lifebane does now in RvR. It literally allows a SB to hit once, and run away Stealthing. Which is exactly what we do IMO.<br />
<br />
So a quick run over to daoc.catacombs.com for their character builder shows something like this:<br />
<br />
Stealth 38<br />
Sword 29<br />
Envenom 50<br />
Critical 39<br />
<br />
Now taking into account that I wont have to train the first 8 points of Stealth, I can pump those into envenom. Which give me an extra 35 spec points to place elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The question then begs, how does this look spec wise, if I get enveom items, can I lower my envenom skill but still use Lifebane (saving the skill points for a different spec.) How about pumping CS or sword more? And, what lvl of stealth should I be shooting for is 39 enough for a lvl 50 SB in RvR?<br />
<br />
The other thought is trying this spec.<br />
<br />
Stealth 40<br />
Swords 25<br />
Critical 40<br />
Envenom 50<br />
<br />
Giving me much better Stealth in PvP sitauations, although making sword lower for PvE, allowing a higher crit for the damage bonus, and getting the lvl 50 envenom for Lifebane.<br />
<br />
I am simply amazed at how complex DAoC is, and specifically how difficult some of the classes are to play like the Hunters, SB, and SM in Midgard.<br />
<br />
Anyhow your help, opinions, and observations would be apreciated. I dont want to &quot;waste&quot; my points and really want to make him a powerhouse in RvR, as well as being a quick killer in PvE.<br />
<br />
Thx.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bia Bia</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">evenom items do allow you to aply the higher level poisons, so there is no need to max to 50 in it.  secondly. 2 handed axes are slower than swords, which will provide a larger first hit (in theory).  The spec of your weapon is going to determine the base damage on your PA, i would recomend keeping it higher than what you have, since your not going left axe at all i think you can afford to do this.  i think you're safe with stealth at 39, (im only going to 35 however) as items + rank can get this to 50.  keep your crit high like you've got and you got a damn nice crit blade.<br />
<br />
<br />
as far as being a power house, you certainly will be as a 1 shotter.  in a large scale battle you'd be better off specing in Left axe.  the template that you are leaning towards is really best played as the 'HI ME AND MY POISON JUST DID 1600+ DAMAGE TO YOU IN .4 SECONDS. K THX BYE.' good luck and have fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Left axe is superior for general combat and P v E, there are envenom items in Midgard and you will have realm rank so 50 envenom is 5 too much, and a sword spec of less than 2/3s of 50 is asking for trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bargle13</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the Axe spec, also increase damage done with the left axe? If so it would seem as if Axe spec for an SB would be superior?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to think the axe spec helps left axe because a majority of axes are +axe, so if you wield two at one time, you'll probably get a huge boost to your axe skill.  Plus, at midlevels at least, there are a lot more axes than swords out there.  But there's nothing wrong with not going LA, if you'd rather do the one shotting.  I'm finding that it seems pretty unlikely to one shot anyone in the battlegrounds due to how close they are in level and how densely packed everyone is.  So it will be some time before you get to enjoy that.<br />
<br />
I also think a left axe template works better with a high envenom skill than a two hander template since you get three poisons off at once (two hander to open, two poisons on both weapons).  If you're going for a one shot character, there's not so much point in having such high envenom. Edited by: Lisboa at: 3/22/02 12:49:46 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bargle13</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How then do you switch from a Two hand weapon, to a Sword, left axe. I tried setting up buttons for this and was unsuccessful.<br />
<br />
Bargle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not easy.  In normal P v E combat I will just keep inventory open and click on my sword or left axe after the first strike, just one click swaps both weapons.  <br />
If you use hotkeys though you have to click on both sword and left axe to switch.  In either case I hit one of my style hotkeys to start the next attack rather than using my attack key.<br />
Not so practical but you have close to 4-5 seconds to do it before you cut into your next swing time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bargle13</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I ran through the Catacombs Character builder again with a new breakout. This is up to lvl 49.5<br />
<br />
Spec to 49.5<br />
Stealth 37<br />
Sword 34<br />
Envenom 45<br />
Critical 40<br />
<br />
This gives me about 144 extra points to play with at lvl 50.<br />
<br />
Now at 50 the only spec I can raise to gain an ability is stealth up to 40 for Safe Fall IV.<br />
<br />
I can put the points into my other abilities for the bonuses, but cannot get any further styles out of any other line. This also doesnt include the extra points I should get for Auto-Training Stealth till lvl 32.<br />
<br />
If I go with this route, is it better to drop the remaining points into stealth, or is it better to put them into a different line like envenom, or crit. The hope here is that I can use minimal items for Envenom 50, and maybe use those items more for Stealth.<br />
<br />
Well again any thoughts and opinions are apreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dragoonkain Of Hayl</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Safe Fall IV isn't that important. With SFIII you can jump off keep walls and take no damage. Max +spec with items/Realm ranks is (lvl/5) +1 so if you take stealth to 39 you can get 39+11 stealth with +spec items at lvl 50<br />
<br />
If you don't know what to throw the extra points in consider that more pts in CS increases max PA dmg and Sword would increase min PA dmg(that's how it works in Albion should be the same in this case).<br />
<br />
Your envenom looks fine as it wouldn't be hard to get a high lvl item to boost that to 50 in combination with a realm rank or two. I don't know enough about Midgard to suggest any +env equipment to you, or even if any exists, but depending on that you can adjust your env. If there's a +4 env weapon like the one in Albion, than with RR2 you're all set for 50 env.<br />
<br />
I would raise either Sword or CS, as the rest of it looks good...39 Stealth will ensure you get max stealth at lvl 50 though. Edited by: Dragoonkain Of Hayl at: 3/22/02 1:59:53 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Benedan</div><div class="date">03-27-02, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far the best combo I have found for spec'ing playing around in Catacombs is this:<br />
<br />
Stealth 40<br />
Sword 34<br />
Envenom 35<br />
Critical Strike 34<br />
Left Axe 34<br />
<br />
As far as I know, this will allow me to use a 2h sword for opening critical strike, then switch to dual wield for battle.  I will use an axe for left hand, and sword in right hand.  This will allow me to use my special attack for sword and left axe.<br />
<br />
Although many say you should max spec one thing, our limited points dont allow for this.  I think you can max a few of the specs with RP and items.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a differing opinion?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-27-02, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty good, though I think 38 stealth is as high as it should go now.  Stealth items are pretty easy to find, I have +9 available at level 30.  Realm rank of +1 or +2 shouldn't be hard either.  Doing this lets you bump up weapon and left axe one each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cwell</div><div class="date">03-28-02, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The max +Skill you can get is +11 at level 50 (bonus)<br />
Edit : it seems that RvR Rank bonuses are cumulative with Items, preaty good news  <br />
<br />
Also, raising Left Axe at 34 is pointless.<br />
Either you go 40+ Left Axe, either you go CS 40+<br />
Those 2 skills are kinda redundant (those are the 2 skill where you get the &quot;high&quot; damage styles), but i think CS is deadlier, not sure though.<br />
Another reason, is that in Midgard you can use 2handed weapons without raising another Skill related to 2hand combat. So if you want those big one shot hit killers, raise the weapon skill itself and CS. <br />
CS determining the max damage, the weaponskill the average damage. Those 2 will tell you how hard you hit. Cwell Vaëlmir, Dwarven Thane (49)<br />
