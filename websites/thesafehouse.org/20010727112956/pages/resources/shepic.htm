              </li>
              <li>To get top part page 24 go to West Karana and see Konia Swiftfoot. 
                He gives you a torch and starts a race. Take the torch to Fajio 
                Knejo in Misty Thicket (close to the wall guards). He gives you 
                another torch. Then take that torch to Andad Filla in South Ro 
                (close to innothule zone) who gives you another torch. Then take 
                that torch to Misty Tekchita in Lake Rathe (by arena zone). This 
                will get you a ring. Finally, take the ring back to Konia Swiftfoot 
                and you will get the top part of page 24<br>
                <br>

              <li>To get the bottom half of you need to give Konia Swiftfoot Mahlin's 
                Bongos. Talk to Braenar Swiftsong. He will give you an invoice 
                after you ask &quot;what doll&quot;. Go to Solusek A and give 
                the gnome vendor, Marfen the invoice and you will recieve a doll. 
                Take the doll to the Estate of Unrest and give the doll to Serra, 
                who is next to the gnomish speulunker. Serra will give you a note. 
                Then take the note from Serra back to Braenar, who will give a 
                new note for Maligar. Take the note from Braenar to Maligar. Maligar's 
                Enraged Doppleganger will attack at that point (bring a group). 
                Kill the Doppleganger and loot his head. Take the head back to 
                Braenar and recieve &quot;Mahlin's Bongo's&quot;. Take the Bongo's 
                to Konia Swiftfoot in West Karana to get the bottom of Page 24<br>
                <br>

                <p> To get page 25 go to South Karana and talk to the woodelf 
                  bard Kelkin Mekia. She wants 3 items: 1) Guts of a named chromatic

                  wrum in Burning Woods (Nezekezena); and 3) guts form the Huge

              <li>Now you need Forpar's Lute. This is rewarded as head, neck, 
                body and strings. First you need to get horn from Ocean of Tears 
                (Alluring horn from Quag Maelstrom). Take the alluring horn from 
                Ocean of Tears to a half elf bard in Butcherblock, by the docks 
                (Vedico). Take the note she gives you to Forpar. He then gives

                his Scepter. He is a God type mob and will require many groups 
                to take him down. Charming some or the wandering wurms and using 
                Fire Elementals works well, as well as pulling him to the Skyfire

                are dead, as well as Lord Nagafen. Once you locate Zordak bring 
                him to Nagy's lair and hand him the Shimmering Pearl, which will 
                cause him to attack you. Kill him and he will spawn once again

                Run over and hand him all three orbs that you have received so 
                far, <b>Orb of Frozen Water, Orb of Clear Water, and the Orb of 
                Vapor</b> and he will hand you back the <b>Orb of the Triumvirate</b>. 
                An Avatar of Water will spawn nearby, it does not respond to hails,

                particle weapon. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                quest begins at an NPC named Kurron Ni who spawns near the docks 
                in Fort Danak. This NPC is a rare spawn so don't be discouraged 
                if he is not there the first few times you check for them. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Do 
                not worry if you are killed on sight at the fort. Kurron spawns 
                near the docks and you will be able to swim or invis yourself 
                to get to him. He is also far enough away from other NPC's that 
                you do not have to worry about them aggroing you when you are 
                there.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
                you ask him what he seeks(do not ask him what his mission is or 
                he will attack you) and then agree to his terms(tell him &quot;I 
                agree&quot;) then he will tell you that he seeks three pieces 
                of darkforge armor(helm, chest and leggings) and 900pp. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Before 
                turning in these items you need to gather up a good party and 
                have them accompany you. Two groups would be best. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Handing 
                these items in to him will simply gain a raise in TrueSpirit faction 
                and he will say that his mission is nearly complete. He will reward 
                you with no items. If you ask him what mission he will tell you 
                of his treachery and then attack you.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At 
                this point you must kill him. Upon killing him you will find a 
                &quot;Note to Duriek&quot; on his corpse. You will need this for 
                the next portion of the quest.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">NOTE: 
                You MUST first hand in these items or he will not drop the note. 
                This has been tested and confirmed.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Duriek 
                can be found overlooking the newbie area in Paineel. He is upstairs 
                in the newbie area looking out through the glass. If you hand 
                him the note he will tell you a story of his apprentice. He will 
                also tell you to &quot;take this for your efforts.&quot; but no 
                item will be given. I'm not sure if this is broken or not. I have 
                contacted Verant about it with no response. Someone has told me 
                that Verant responded to this on a public board saying that no 
                item is supposed to be given but I was never able to find the 
                thread. Either way you receive TrueSpirit faction and are able 
                to continue the quest.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
                you ask him what apprentice he will give you further background. 
                Tell him that you will take his apprentice's place and he will 
                ask you to prove your worth first. Duriek is aging and is in need 
                of a cough elixir. This is obtained via a side quest in Neriak. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Upon 
                returning the cough elixir to Duriek he will inform you that he 
                was trying to create a corrupted ghoulbane. Unfortunately he is 
                no condition to gather the components. His previous apprentice 
                was searching for them when he met his demise. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                needs you to find a tome for him. This tome can be found in The 
                Hole on Ratman Guards. The best place to find these guards is 
                by taking a left upon entering the first fortress and then take 
                another left and pass down past the pool. Between this area and 
                the old city beneath it Ratman Guards spawn fairly commonly as 
                patrollers. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Beware 
                that these rats are extremely tough. They hit for 370s, are very 
                magic resistant and have a ton of hit points. The tome is a rare 
                drop on them so you are likely going to have to kill several of 
                them to obtain one. Our first encounter with one we had 7 people 
                and no deaths but we had a high level party and Turgur's stuck 
                on the first attempt. In later raids we had as many as 25 people 
                and might lose 5-8 people each attempt. A lot of it depends on 
                if you can get Turgurs or another speed reducing spell to stick 
                early.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Handing 
                the Tome to Duriek will grant another faction adjustment and will 
                reveal what items he will need to complete the corrupted ghoulbane. 
                He requires:</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1) 
                Blade of Abrogation from the Plane of Air<br>
                2) Soul Leech from Cazic Thule in the Plane of Fear<br>
                3) Ghoulbane from upper guk. <br>
                4) Decrepit Sheath from a Qeynos side quest.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Returning 
                this items to him will result in a corrupted ghoulbane(dmg 16 
                delay 34 effect dismiss undead sk only 1hslash) and will send 
                you to seek out Lhranc in the City of Mist. This item is not much 
                use to a shadowknight of this level but it is required for the 
                next portion of the quest.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Lhranc 
                spawns approximately at location 0,0 in the City of Mist. This 
                is just before the Reaver area near the large hut with all of 
                the Goos. He spawns in the middle hut right past the big goo house. 
                He spawns at the bottom and the two NPC's who spawn upstairs are 
                not placeholders. Upon speaking with him he will reveal what he 
                needs to forge your weapon.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Each 
                of these steps is accomplished by completing a sub-quest. These 
                sub-quests all tie in together. The heart of an innocent and the 
                will of innoruuk are wearable items that are among the best that 
                shadowknight can attain. As a result these sub-quests are listed 
                with their own seperate pages that are cross-linked together. 
                They are listed in the neccessary order of completion.</font></p>

                these three items along with the corrupted ghoulbane to Lhranc 
                and he will reward you by turning in to a living version of himself 
                wielding the almighty Innoruuk's Curse. Killing him will allow

                and he will tell you that you must now kill Lord Ghiosk. Enter
