<br />
(I only saw two, Shadowcross found a third)<br />
<br />
Righto, logged a few of the Kitty &quot;outpost&quot; quest dialogs last night:<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Scout Husman'<br />
Scout Husman says 'Hello Maloscat, It's a good day for a raid, wouldn't you agree?<br />
You say, 'What raid, fur face?'<br />
Scout Husman says 'I know the way to a grimling camp close to here. If you have about six people of my strength we have a good chance of taking it over. With luck, a grimling officer will take part in their counterattack, and they can carry valuable treasure indeed. Fetch me a polished acrylia sphere and I'll guide you.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Scout Danarin'<br />
Scout Danarin says 'Hello Maloscat, welcome to the front lines of our war against the bastard grimlings. As I'm sure you know, we Vah Shir shun violence, but with this enemy there is no other way. Let me know if you'd like to see some action.<br />
You say, 'What action?'<br />
Scout Danarin smiles, 'I can escort you to a camp rich with enemies. With my help you can take possession of their camp. They'll try desperately to reclaim their lost territory and, if we're lucky, an officer will show up. You'll want to bring about ten soldiers as powerful as me. When you're all here and ready for battle, give me a marbled acrylia sphere.<br />
<br />
Scout Danarin regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Note, both green.'<br />
***<br />
<br />
Wonder if this ties in with the Champion's Box quest given by the General in the outpost...<br />
<br />
I was soloing around, and didn't try to trigger this quest, but the acryliia spheres are available there, in the outpost. Again, Shadowcross got farther on this than I. Anyone else keep the NPC alive?<br />

<br />
The Champion's box quest is supposed to be a quicker means of obtaining it.<br />
<br />
At least thats what I got out of my conversation with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Elkihn</div><div class="date">12-06-01, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incase you were looking for more info about the action part of the quest, here ya go.<br />
A mid 50's group of mine did the one requiring 10 people... he lead us to a camp, charged in, and we killed all the grimlings. So, we sit there in the empty camp and another wave of grimlings come in and we kill them. This happens about 15-20 more waves and still no officer that he was talking about has showed up. We just let him die and went on to explore deeper in.<br />
<br />
This leads me to believe the officer is a random spawn in the waves of the grimlings. That, or the quest is broken. Probably the first option though.<br />
<br />
btw, the trick to keeping him alive is simple: just hit every grimling that comes in with the wave once or twice and they'll aggro on you and not him. Keep him alive or the quest ends... he can't be buffed/healed either.</div></div><hr />

Thu Dec 06 19:09:18 2001] Scout Husman says 'Hello Malachite, It's a good day for a raid, wouldn't you agree? <br />
[Thu Dec 06 19:09:21 2001] You say, 'i agree'<br />
[Thu Dec 06 19:09:21 2001] Scout Husman says 'Well, if you have the courage, round up about six people of my strength and, when you're ready to begin, give me a polished acrylia sphere.

[Thu Dec 06 19:09:37 2001] Scout Husman says 'Nothing better than killing grimlings for the king! Follow me closely and fight well. Make certain that I survive, for if I perish the mission will be a failure. <br />
 [Thu Dec 06 19:10:37 2001] Scout Husman says 'The camp is just ahead. To be safe, stay behind me until I give the word. Be silent and stay low... and may the spirits bless our effort. <br />

[Thu Dec 06 19:13:53 2001] Scout Husman says 'Well done Malachite! Successful raids like this will bring you great glory among our people. Take this insignia as proof of your experience here in service of the king. Leave this place now, for it will be taken over by the enemy momentarily. Farewell! <br />

<br />
<br />
I wouldn't reccomend doing it solo, the Scout has a much higher chance of dying when you're alone. After you clear most of the camp, the officer will come and you kill/loot turn in his scalp and then the the quest is completed. There's 2 more scout quests and then one huge war where you kill some commander and loot a key which leads to the Grimling &quot;Master&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_XandirFairhand</div><div class="date">12-07-01, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I agree the end result of this series of quests is the same as the champions box one that the General gives you... but you probably get more faction doing the little quests.<br />
<br />
I did the Scout Hamus quest, just me (60 monk) and a 59 mage (thanks Danariel!) were able to do it without too much problem.  Hint: you can /assist the scout, and if you stay alert you can put yourself between the charging grimlings and the Scout so they agro on you and not him.<br />
<br />
I found out tho that the real beginning of this is to talk to one of the VahShir.. Captain someone, on a porchfront with a Scout.  The captain says 'help out scouts Hamus, Darrin, and Dxxx(I forget) and then put their rewards in a Chest Of Valor and give it to me for more instructions'.  Well, thats the gist of it.  So 3 miniquests later (and innumerable dead grimlings later) I put the three medals (copper, silver lined copper, and gold lined copper) into a chest of Valor and hit Combine to end up with a Soldier's Chest.  Giving that to the Captain gets me instructions to gather 'two dozen people as strong as myself' and then hand in the map so he can lead the way.<br />
<br />
this together with clues from the General's text makes me think that I would eventually get a Copper Medal of the Vah'Shir or somesuch, then upgradeable to Silver and Gold, which I could turn in to the General for the key.  Just a theory... a dozen miniquests (4 total per medal) to get the<br />
end result.<br />
<br />
At this point I was tired so decided to work on the General's version of the quest... I got as far as finding Acrylia Caverns before chickening out of wandering around solo in an unknown dungeon full of blues.   Anyone have any idea on the whreabout of any of the items the General requests?<br />

I wandered down to the Acrylia Caverns last night and died a quick and disastrous death when I got overconfident and tried to solo one of the entrance mobs who was darkblue at 55 (darn HT).  So far, it appears that none of the grimlings see through invisibility which is very helpful.  A few named were on track at the zone entrance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">12-08-01, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to do the quest where the cat asks for 6 people to come with of his level.  He was green so I tried it myself.<br />
<br />
Most fun I ever had!  I wiped that place clean!  To bad the cat died on the second attempt of the grimlings to retake the camp.<br />
<br />
I'd like to mention that I think the buying stones to start the quests is a great idea.  It means they don't have to make the npc spawn rarely to keep people from chain doing the quest do to the cost requirement.<br />
<br />
Also, you should note that one of the generals says he has half of the key to the area where the Grimling master is.<br />
<br />
And that the a grimling commander has the other half.<br />
<br />
So likely, you do the three scout quests, and combine there medals in the hero box and give it to the general out on the porch(cause he, ya know, ask you to get each scouts medal and put them in a box and give it to him).<br />
<br />
This most likely start the attack that lets you kill the commander with the half of the key.<br />
<br />
give that half to the general and he puts the key together and gives it back whole.  So you got a key to wherever now. Edited by: Ravenwinged Angel at: 12/8/01 4:23:12 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">12-10-01, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think there is a 4th step in it.. I am quite sure the captain will give you another task/fight to do, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kormus</div><div class="date">12-10-01, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quest starts in the outpost in the Grimling Woods. You talk to General Staginar, he is in the first building to the right behind the bank.<br />
<br />
  You say, 'Hail General Staginar'<br />
General Staginar says 'Greetings, Kormus. Are you here to serve in the war against the grimling horde? <br />
You say, 'yes i am here to serve in the war'<br />
General Staginar says 'As you probably know, we've been battling the grunts for nearly a generation now. They have proven to be a challenging opponent. We've inflicted great casualties upon their kind in this war, yet somehow, they seem to grow even more numerous. Barring some miracle, they will become a serious threat to Shar Vahl very soon. One remaining strategy has a chance of bringing us victory, but none have met the requirements for its implementation. <br />
You say, 'what are the requirements?'<br />
General Staginar says 'Our intelligence has provided us with some information about the enemy. They blindly follow a being they refer to as 'the master'. Our high spiritists have sensed a powerful presence from the caverns beyond our mines, but only those who possess a special key can venture there. None who have obtained the key and ventured into the caverns have been seen alive again. <br />
You say, 'where can i get the key?'<br />
General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander holds half of a magical acrylia obelisk that will transport the wielder to their master's stronghold. I have slain the high commander who held the other half of the obelisk and I have the knowledge of it's construction. I will only give it to one who has proven to be a powerful soldier, for nothing less would stand a chance against the enemy ruler. <br />
You say, 'what high commander?'<br />
General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander will only appear if their compound to the north is overrun. There are two encampments near the compound that will need to be invaded as well in order to secure the area. It is a very complex mission and I will only authorize you to lead it if you have demonstrated competence. Serve our people by successfully completing the lesser raids here in the forest. Bring me the Golden Medal of the Shar Vahl as proof of your prowess, or, if you are already at least as powerful as I am, there is another test that will give me confidence in your abilities. <br />
You say, 'what other test?'<br />
General Staginar says 'If you are less experienced than I am, performing this task will gain you nothing. With that in mind, take this box and venture through the mines and into the caverns. Combine in it Gooplart's tooth, Gizgargank's scalp, Grikplag's skull, Gnildaria's eye, Gnerpokkel's heart, Gilgaplank's toes, the husk of the summoned burrower, and the shackles of a Vah Shir captive. Return to me with the Box of the Hero of Shar Vahl and I will send a team of our veterans to escort you into battle.<br />
<br />
You receive a container (cannot remember the name of the box exactly). This container has 8 slots, one for each piece.<br />
<br />
Behind the building with the general is a perch with a an imprisoned grimling. Talk to it.<br />
<br />
  You say, 'Hail, an imprisoned grimling'<br />
an imprisoned grimling looks up at you through wild eyes, 'You help me, I tell you things! I no lie! You not kill me. I beg. Things I know, you will see.' <br />
You say, 'what things'<br />
an imprisoned grimling says 'Big catman in jail we have. I got key. I give you key and you not kill me. I beg! <br />
You say, 'what key'<br />
an imprisoned grimling says 'Take, take, I trust. You no kill me now. Hurry, locks change soon!<br />
<br />
You receive a forked key (cannot quite remember the name). The key is lore, no rent and no drop.<br />
<br />
I thought about getting the items General Staginar talked about in the Caves leading to the Acrylia Caverns - some semi named up, lots of runes dropped but no notable item except one grimling toes who aren't even no drop. Farmed the Caves for 2 hours, then we moved into Acrylia Caverns. No single grimling outside in GW saw invis and no grimling inside does. So it is rather safe to roam there.<br />
Beware: Mobs (30% SKs) level 42 and up, resulting in multiple 600+ HTs can turn this cakewalk quickly into a nightmare. AC strips levitate buffs and you cant levitate inside. Do NOT try to CoH in AC - this will result in a grimling hero spawning that is reported to be lvl 57 (I cannot confirm that but I didn't try) and the 'spell not working in this zone' message.<br />
Spawn time is around 8 minutes I believe (didn't time it but it is short) so you better be moving forward while rolling through the zone - agro range of the grimlings at lvl 60 is rather short so you could squeeze through at some point.<br />
Rather small, boring zone with 3 exceptions: <br />
a) A kind of summoning circle that spawns (or rather shows) grimlings around it when you enter it - those are illusions I think because they don't have names and disappear as soon as you leave the circle.<br />
b) A waterfilled cavern with fishes inside (don't see invis) and a 'Summoned Hatchling' ('Sandwurm/Shai-Hulud' model) that cant be targeted. Dropping invis does not produce results, cavern is surrounded by grimlings, some of them 'grimling summoners' (summoned the hatchling perhaps?) which are nowhere else to be found.<br />
c) A kind of ruined temple area with grimlings and 'a possessed corpse' (vah shir skeleton) - some of those skeletons are casters and see invis, all possessed corpses seem to be around lvl 46 SKs. A large stair which leads to a closed drawbridge like castle front (drawbridge is not a door and closed) and a large room with a lava pool in the middle - you cannot get out if you fall in so watch out.<br />
Here is where the interesting part starts. To the left of the large room is a door which leads to another locked door - if you use the key you got from the imprisoned grimling you find the imprisoned vah shir.<br />
<br />
  You say, 'Hail, Trondol Shir'<br />
Trondol Shir looks around frantically, 'What are you doing here? You'll be killed! Do not waste your time trying to help me. Save yourself and leave at once!' <br />
You say, 'i will help you'<br />
Trondol Shir shakes his head in frustration, 'I am beyond help. The key to my shackles is held by the grunts' high priest, curse him. I feel his dark magic pulling at my soul. I am doomed to join the legion of our fallen people that serve their twisted master here. <br />
You say, 'what key?'<br />
Trondol Shir opens his mouth as if to speak, but lacks the strength to form words. <br />
You say, 'what high priest?'<br />
Trondol Shir Trondol speaks slowly between shallow, labored breaths, 'Through some kind of dark magic, the grunts steal away the spirit energy from their victims. I know not what they do with this energy once they procure it. When the victim is all but drained of life, the high priest forces them to walk to the end of the platform over there. He then performs some sacrificial ritual that hurls the prisoner into the pit. Shortly thereafter, the bones of the fallen are collected and reanimated, destined to serve the grunts forever. I have seen this a dozen times now, and now my time is near.' <br />
<br />
I suppose you get the shackles the general requested from Trondol Shir if you free him. The lava pool is surrounded by other non targetable grimlings and there is a 'plank' leading out above the lava from a room which is accessed by a door on the opposite side of the large room.<br />
Inside is a grimling priest (actually I believe talking to Trondol Shir made additional priests spawn on the exact spot - priests conned blue to lvl 60) who is again not targetable and 4 possessed corpse. I could not kill the corpses solo (left my team out because we had no inviser) and the priest didnt react to my presence if deinvised. The 'plank' which will lead the captured Vah Shir to their fiery fate is reported to have an irresistible trap and will hurl you in the lava - I didn't confirm that though.<br />
<br />
I suppose you somehow need to trigger the ceremony to have a chance to kill the priest and free the captured cat - the key to free Trondol Shir should be dropped by the priest. Handing the key to Trondol will result in him giving you the key back.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will return later tomorrow and try other ways to free Trondol. Help with getting the 7 other quest parts (which I doubt to be dropped by grimlings in the Caves which someone posted after killing named and non named grimlings for two hours) would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wrren Bloodraven</div><div class="date">12-10-01, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I finished all three scout quests.  You need to combine the three medals you receive (gold, silver, copper) in the chest of valor (purchased at the merchant), and give it to the captain.  He then gives you a map of the grimling forest (I couldnt read it though, tried for about 20 minutes, clicking on the darn thing), and says to return the map to him when you are ready for battle.  The awesome part, is that he asks for TWENTY FOUR people to come.  Stupid me, I didnt turn my log on, but I took screenshots of his text.  Btw, I did the scout quests with myself (60 war), 59 sk, 59 druid, and 56 shaman.  The SK and shaman pets work extremelly well, as they aggro on anything around (having them sit helps more).  So anyways, once I figure out how many people Im going to do this with, I return the map to the captain, and he leads me on a raid against the grimling main fort (Im thinking the one in front of the acrylia cave entrance).  Hope this helped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kormus</div><div class="date">12-11-01, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So advancements in the quest now.<br />
My team has found 5 of the 8 items the general requested.<br />
4 of them drop off named mobs in the grimling forest mines.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This map should explain the location of each of the 4 named mobs. They have placeholders which have unique names themselves - a grimling sorceress, a grimling overseer twice and a grimling prophet.<br />
Watch out though: Those mobs give a new definition to the term 'undercon': All hit very fast for 150+ up to 190, summon (at level 41!) and the casters gate. Our lvl 60 Cleric/SK tag team had trouble handling them, make sure you got enough physical stunning power because some of them cannot be stunned by spells.<br />
We haven't quite figured out if the metalworker is a PH of some sort (killed around 18 of them without a named spawning): Other notable mobs are the three grimling foremen roaming the entrance area as well as the both grimling guardians beside the entrance to the Acrylia Caverns. We are convinced that they are not important (killed a lot of foremen and some guardians to check) but they may as well be - need more raw killing numbers to confirm that for good.<br />
<br />
The fifth drop we had was from Corpseraiser Gilgaplank inside the Acrylia Caverns:<br />
<br />
<br />
He spawns near the 'cage' with the possessed corpse in the middle of the room - the picture should give you a hint there.<br />
He seems to not have a semi named PH which poses a problem: The sixth quest item drops off of a named grimling for sure and we are convinced that Gooplart spawns inside the Acrylia Caverns.<br />
<br />
The other two quest parts should be tied to the summoned hatchling in the underwater cavern and the cat captive near the lava pool with the sacrificial party.<br />
We killed the two 'grimling summoner' standing above the pool leading to the hatchling for quite some time today to maybe get a rare drop off of them (which could be the husk) or in case they are the PH for a named summoner - the hatchling in the cavern has been summoned which could point to one of the mobs there having the husk.<br />
<br />
About the captive: We can get to him but we cannot seem to trigger his release or sacrifice - so another thought could be that the captive drops the shackles himself (herself?!). I pulled him to the zone (he cons green and hits for 177 max) and we tried to kill him. At 30% health this happened:<br />
Trondol Shir hits YOU for 79 points of damage.<br />
You crush Trondol Shir for 36 points of damage.<br />
Trondol Shir says 'My comrades will avenge my death.'<br />
You must target an NPC to taunt first.<br />

You begin casting Locate Corpse.<br />
You don't sense any corpses.<br />
He could have poofed in the wall I pushed him into but I doubt that. He was not in his cell when I checked shortly after - maybe he is scripted to return or poof after a certain amount of time (already pulled him on top of the high priest) and it was an awfully long fight. We will try again to kill the captive tomorrow (although I doubt he drops the shackles - for sure death would save him from the grisly fate he is about to meet but this is a tad hard).<br />
<br />
Another notable thing revolves around the ritual circle in the caverns:<br />
As you step into the grimling's ring of fire, a hot breeze blows into the cavern and begins swirling about you. The grimling's constant chanting seems to grow louder... <br />
At this point I charged the warder who spawned in the hallway leading to the circle.<br />
a grimling warder says 'A fine sacrifice you make! Say hello to the master! <br />
a grimling warder says 'It's Dark Elves like you who have ruined your own lands. You'll not ruin mine!'<br />
Your shadows fade.<br />
A grimling warder hits YOU for 106 points of damage.<br />
a grimling warder shouts 'Master! The sacred ring of fire has been cleansed of tresspassers. <br />
You begin casting Death Peace.<br />
You regain your concentration and continue your casting.<br />

You are knocked back.  You have taken 2 points of damage.<br />
The warder teleported me right behind the black statue at the back of the wall of the lava pool which casted a knockback spell every 2 seconds. Luckily I was on the back of the statue so I was smacked against the wall. Later on I had to jump to get out though - I fell 'accidentally' into the lava and went LD *cough*. When I logged back I was at the zone in.<br />
<br />
All of this has us still missing Gooplart's tooth, the husk of a Summoned burrower and the shackles of a Vah Shir captive.<br />
We may have another clue though where this quest is headed - the castle behind the drawbridge (which was the natural goal) but we have a confirmation now:<br />
<br />
<br />
Transcription: &quot;a grimling guard says 'Be certain the switch stays disabled. The master has ordered that the castle remain sealed from tresspassers.&quot;<br />
Either the final key that is the result of this quest is used to open the drawbridge or it is somehow used to activate the switch.<br />
<br />
There are some questions now we cannot solve on our own (with 2 people this quest is already hard enough):<br />
1) How is it possible to free the vah shir (a free captive means a pair of shackles without a master)?<br />
2) Is there a way to spawn the summoned burrower somehow if the grimling summoners are neither PHs for a named grimling or have the husk as a rare drop?<br />
3) Where is Gooplart located? We think he should be in the Acrylia Caverns but there are no more semi named left to aim for - did anyone stumble across an unusual formation of mobs, a semi named or Gooplart himself?<br />
4) Can anyone confirm a rather large number of metalworker and foremen kills so it becomes certain they are no PHs for a named?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience and sorry for this much loading time for pictures.<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Stanly Manly</div><div class="date">12-11-01, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I finished all three of the scout quests, combined the medals in the chest of valor, and handed it in to the captain.  He returns you a map (which didnt seem to be a map) and when you give it back to him, he starts to walk to a grimling camp, just like the scout quests.  Now I had done all 3 with me (55 sk), a 55 chanter, and 56 ranger with no problems.  So I figured we could handle this one as well.  Well it turns out that you meet up with a second vashir officer along the way.. and the captain tells you that you need to split up your group, and the stronger force stay with him. DOH!!!<br />
<br />
With only 3 ppl there was really no way to do this.  We let the officer go on alone with the hope that he wasn't necessary for the quest.  We whiped out the camp that the Captain took us too fairly easily, but the officer was killed...<br />
<br />
As soon as we finished clearing the camp, and the Captain went to his spot, he said something about the officer being killed and now we have no chance... and promply poofed, ending my quest.  So be forewarned, you will need 2 groups to do this part.<br />
<br />
So I tried the alternate method... went for the body parts that the general has.  Ranger tracked down the named to the caverns before the zone to Acrylia Caverns.  Some Overseer.. con light blue.  Single pulling was easy.  5 seconds later we were on CR.  Sucker hits for 180 and very very fast.  He also summons.  As do the rest I imagine.  Later we came back with a slower and a cleric and he was easy once slowed.   We got 2 of the named... Overseer, and a Sorceress.  I have not been able to find the rest, but have heard that they all spawn in that area.  Im going to return sometime and kill all of the grims in there to find the rest of the spawns.  <br />
<br />
Still have no idea about the summoned burrower or shackles... I'm thinking it may be easier just to do the scout/captain quests again with a few more ppl.</div></div><hr />

You have to switch back to the normal screen to right click something to read it.<br />

Anyway, I now believe that doing the scout/captain chain of quests will eventually end in a fight with the grimling leader with the first half of the key, while the generals quest will result in the other half.</div></div><hr />

Do the 3 coin quest and hand in the box with the coins. Once you have enough people split up, one group (the stronger one) would prbably attack the main gate of the castle (where the evil master is) whilst the officer group (the weaker one) goes for the switch to lower the gate to the castle.<br />

Anyone tried that? pure speculation but it might work  <br />

Eeep: you said one of the named spawns by the summoners by the water. Could you explain by using my map where exactly?<br />

When its true that the 6th named spawns there this thread can be used to find all of them. The only missing items are the husk of the summoned burrower, and the shackles of a Vah Shir captive.<br />

&gt; Also read someone had seen a second named mob in the water with <br />

This is true I have read the same and maybe we should farm the fishes to spawn a rare fish that drops the husk of the summoned burrower. I am sure that the &quot;husk of the summoned burrower&quot; will drop in this area.<br />

&gt; I read that when a sacrifice occurs the priest spawns into a lower lvl <br />

We should try this: I will step on the shackles on the platform behind the High Priest and while the trap is triggered on me Kormus will try to maybe kill the High Priest. Edited by: Rosalinde at: 12/12/01 4:10:46 am</div></div><hr />

We learned the tale of the cruel ceremony from the weakened Vah'Shir, and decided that we would slay the High Priest. But we would need a plan....a ruse. We chose a decoy, an Erudite Wizard among us. He would be taken onto the ledge, and as the High Priest began the ceremony, we would charge his room and slay him. <br />
<br />
Well, the trap was triggered, but the High Priest did not become targetable. What did happen was that the room spawned Possessed Skeletons (not normal room spawn) which we thought must be the test to pass...as though the High priest summoned his minions to stop us from ruining the sacrifice. Our party was defeated, over run by the skeletons' sheer numbers. <br />

Would really like to complete this sequence.</div></div><hr />

We did beat the shackle-spawned skeletons, but only got bone chips. No other noticable change   <br />

<br />
Here is what I have to report.  The named Grimlings have quite a few different things they can drop.. most of which are just kinda weird, but some are fairly nice. <br />
<br />
Such as:<br />
<br />
ac 7, str 7, dex 7, hp 20, +3% sneak skill mask, all/all<br />
<br />
some range slot item that has +5% 2hb skill.. which i cant remember the stats, but I think this item is quite nice (especially since I like using my 2hb weapon)<br />
<br />
some necro boots with +3% channeling skill<br />
<br />
Today I saw the named prophet up and he was holding a mace with a skull at the end that looked very cool, so I think there is quite a loot table that these mobs have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kormus</div><div class="date">12-13-01, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Eeep: Please describe the location of both Acrylia Caverns named we are missing. Currently we got: Gizgargank's Scalp (Giz being one of the Overseers in the Mines), Gnerpokkel's heart (Overseer #2 in the Mines), Gnildaria's eye (Sorceress in the Mines), Griplak's Skull (Prophet in the Mines) and Gilgaplank's toes (Necro inside AC near the 'Possessed Corpse stable').<br />
We are missing the husk, the shackles and Gooplart.<br />
You wrote of the dreamspinner (which could be Gooplark and you called Possessor) inside AC as a PH. If I follow your directions, zone into AC and take two right turns I indeed reach a fireplace where a dreamspinner is at the back wall flanked by two priests - is this correct and if it is what is the name that spawns there?<br />
You too wrote of a named mob in the room where the water pool that leads to the summoned hatchling is. This room has two summoners on the ledge above the pool, one priest behind them and two other mobs in the corners behind them - which of them is the correct PH for the named mob?<br />
<br />
@Raloon: Could you please give infos on that part? I need hard facts before I will lead a group all the way in there. You say you killed 'enough skellies' to make the priest targetable?<br />
So how many of them spawned, did some spawn after, what happened to the priest, how hard did he hit, what did you loot off of him? Could the loot be used to free the prisoner and get his shackles?<br />
<br />
Our clues are as following: As soon as you prove your worth to the general he will do an attack like the scouts in the quests before, this time on the fortifications in front of the AC Mines which will result in another high commander being killed which will net you the second half of the key. This key - completed by the general - will be used to open the drawbridge leading into the castle. There you will be able to slay the evil master that resurrects all those grimlings who aim for world domination.<br />
<br />
Please help us out with your thoughts.<br />
<br />
@Stanley: I know you from KW forum - do me a favor and finish the camp charge #4 and tell me if you reached the same level you would reach by finishing the 8 box quest - we can't seem to find enough people to do even the third camp charge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Stanly Manly</div><div class="date">12-13-01, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Camp Charge #4 with captain was a failure when I tried it.  We had 6 ppl total.. me, necro, and a druid followed the Seargent to the &quot;weaker&quot; camp, and monk, ranger, and another druid went to the &quot;main&quot; camp with the Captain.<br />
<br />
As soon as the charge was called, the Seargent popped right into camp and about 10 mobs swamped him.  Me and the necro were fearing off mobs and I was trying to taunt as many as possible, but they overwhelmed us and killed the Seargant very quickly.  The other guys were able to hold off the Captain's camp.  But if the Seargant dies.. the quest is a failure, even if the Captain remains alive.  He said &quot;one of ours has fallen, we cannot win&quot; or something like that, then poofs.<br />
<br />
So at that point I decided to do the General's other quest instead.  I'm debating whether or not that was the best choice.  Either way, it seems you are going to need at least 2 groups to do either.<br />
<br />
I have now 5 of the 8 parts, missing tooth, husk, and shackles.  I'm trying to get my guild to support me, but its really hard getting anyone away from xp now with alt advancement.<br />
<br />
Im thinking its going to take 2 good groups to do the parts in AC, except the Corpseraiser.  Corpseraiser spawns near the center of that possesed corpse room, and can be pulled single pretty easy.<br />
<br />
The dreamspinner that is supposedly the PH for Gloopart is on the far side of her camp, with about 10 other grimlings around her.<br />
<br />
There are tons of mobs on the way to the  vashir captive, and with their fast respawn, you will want a lot of killing power to be able to move through quickly.<br />
<br />
I think its going to take a raid type force to do the general's battle, and then the final battle in AC to kill the master.<br />
<br />
This quest seems so interesting and has been a ton of fun, its sad that no one is willing to take the time and do it instead of xp'ing for that next aa point.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. sorry if this post is kinda rambling.. im tired..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to the high priest's room, sit a caster or something on the ledge, set up your group infront of the ledge.  Kill all the skeletons - was a /yawn'er for 2 light groups, btw. Anyway, eventually you kill enough skeletons, keeping the person on the ledge alive, and the high priest gets pissed.  Person on the ledge gets summoned to the priest, and priest becomes targetable and attacks.  Priest is a cleric, blue to 60, slowable, high ac, but not really all that hard.  Drops a shackle key, which is nodrop and norent.<br />
<br />
Go over to the kitty prisoner and give him the shackle key, he says something about being hurt and he doesnt think he can escape.  Keep him alive while he tries to escape... not sure what happens next, since we werent expecting this, and he got killed on his way out. Presumably, if you keep him alive, he'd give you the shackles I guess, and you'd be set to continue the quest.<br />

edit: same thing happened w/ the kitty when we freed it, and weren't expecting it...so it died and we lost the key, so we were bored and tried the ring, we fought for an hour straight ... two skeles spawn over and over if someone's in the ring, and a warder blocks the tunnel in the way.  You *need* two groups for this, lots of the skeles later are healers and/or are unmezzable.  I don't know what it results in however, other then a couple of dropped from intermissionary named skeles, cause two melees at the same time managed to run into the tunnel too close to the warder and got stuck outside ... in a matter of minutes, we were then surrounded by skeles, we must have been very close to completing the sequence though.<br />
No harm in trying this, cause if you all get out of the ring the skeles will poof (if they're the first wave anyway), but you'll need very high damage output to take out two skels every 30 or 45 seconds.<br />

Yes. Possessor Gooplart.<br />
<br />
Get a good group for her.  Some nukers will help here.  Get high MR.  She will slow you, she will charm (or mez,  I did not check) all of your group if it's small and you don't have high enough MR.<br />
<br />
We had 7 level 60s and all our melees were slowed with 200+ MR.  She's not too hard if you prepare for her.<br />
<br />
The shackles part seems to be solvable.  We killed the priest after slaying the skeletons and got the NO RENT key.  However our server crashed and I doubt we will have the key by the time we can come back.  But it looks like after you escort him out alive, you will get the shackles.<br />

I finished the 3 scout battles with minimal effort.  Got folks motivated to do the Captain battle, and we were off.<br />
<br />
1.5 hours later a grimling officer spawned and I turned in his toes to the Captain.  There were 2 difficult parts to this paticular peice of the quest. First, when the 2 Vashir charge the camps, they get swamped by mobs and can die if you are not careful.  Ours got down pretty low on hp but we were able to prevail.  Second, the sheer amount of time it took for the officer to spawn.  10 minutes into the quest and ppl were remarking that it was fun.  30 minutes into quest ppl were remarking that they were bored.  1 hour into quest ppl were getting pissed/wanted to leave/sleepy.. so I petitioned.  Guide was no help, but after about 15 or 20 minutes the officer finally spawned, thank @#%$.<br />

After turning in the grimling officer toes to the Captain, he awarded me with the Silver Medal of War.  General wants Golden Medal of Vashir Hero or something.. so there was another step.  Sure enough, Veteran Vadrel wants the Silver Medal of War.  I turn it in and he gives me his war plans.  Again it didnt seem readable, although I have not identified it  yet.<br />
<br />
So everyone was too burnt out to try the next step, as was I.  Veteran tells you to get 2 dozen ppl and hand him the plans to kick off the next stage.  I hope to be able to get enough ppl together again tomorrow night and do the Veteran's battle.<br />
<br />
That is all for now... must sleep...</div></div><hr />

we are still missing the burrower's husk. has anyone done a /bug on the burrower? perhaps his untargetable-ness is due to a bug or a misflag.<br />
<br />
also, when we went to do the ring of fire thing today, there were mobs up inside the castle, behind the drawbridge. arch magi, undead wardens, maybe a couple other things. not sure why exactly they were there then. i figured stuff would only spawn in there once you've used the key to get in there and trigger the fight with the Master</div></div><hr />

Those warden things are level 60 skeles behind the arch magi room overlooking a pit with a ladder going down into it...went down into it, but nothing happened.<br />
There's also a room if you go straight from the drawbridge area with a chair and some torches and rugs and stuff on the walls, and a door in the floor which is keyed (and unpickable).<br />
Above this room, there's a stairway leading up to a balcony thing overlooking the entrance and there's a cauldron surrounded by four torches.<br />
There's some stairs leading down which go into a dungeon area with two cages that have bones and stuff lying around in them, no mobs though (I am guessing stuff spawns upon entering the cages).<br />
But the arch mage there must be hella tough.  This is a very interesting zone...and I think that it either leads to another zone (via a portal), or has some really difficult sequence stuff deeper in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first three scout invasions are trivial.  You lose some cash if your scout dies and that's about it.  I can solo the first two and need 2-3 people for the third.<br />
<br />
Problem with the scout invasions is that a grimling officer may not spawn for hours.  So you end up sitting in a camp bored to death.<br />
<br />
The next one is a captain invasion.  Captain meets with a sergeant past the bridge and then you have to clear two camps.  A smaller camp with the sergeant and a larger one with the captain.  The smaller camp can be held with 3 people but a larger one needs about 5-6.  Just because of the numbers of grimling there.  A person can only have 3 NPCs' attention.<br />
<br />
Problem with the captain invasion is that a grimling officer may not spawn for hours.  So you end up sitting in a camp bored to death together with several other people.<br />
<br />
If you lose this invasion, you lose all your work.  So you have to bore yourself with the scout invasions again.<br />
<br />
The next one is a vetaran invasion.  The vetaran stops at one point on the way to the grimling camps and says that there is an ambush.  Several grimlings spawn near him and you kill them.<br />
<br />
Then he meets with another cat.  Here you need to split up your group again.  Both cats then go to their camps and charge them and then promptly die because they get nuked by grimlings within 5 seconds.  We lost both, the veteran and the other cat right at start.  I suggest you send in your people before the cats charge.<br />
<br />
Don't bother killing any grimlings because the whole camp will respawn when the cats charge.  This is also tru with the previous invasions.  But by having people in camp you will take most of the aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyway, at this point I gave up.  I lost everything that I aquired previously.  I did not want to waste my time and time of about 12 other level 60 people.<br />
<br />
So, I went to try the other route.<br />
<br />
I currently have 6 of the 8 components required.<br />
<br />
We completed the grimling high priest part of the quest but before we could escort the prisoner out, our server crashed.  I lost the no rent key of course.<br />
<br />
The next time we went to kill the high priest, there were three of them up.  So, three times the skeletons. After a petition, GMs looked at it but could not do anything about the extra versions of the high priests.  They could not target them.<br />
<br />
So, we got about 24 people to try to AOE the skeletons.  It almost worked.  Our one chanter died from the HTs right at the end of the third wave.  We gave up on this idea.<br />
<br />
Another day, another patch and we were off to pay the high priest a visit.  Well, guess what we found?  Nothing.  No high priest up.<br />
<br />
Well, to make something out of the trip, we got more people to attempt the fire ring.  We had three groups of mostly level 60s.<br />
<br />
We did very well.  Got first wave and their boss down.  Second wave and their boss down.  Third wave and their boss down. Then came the fourth wave and after a while we were overcome.<br />
<br />
First three waves we handled well.  Two skeleton spawns per spawn. First wave is light blue warrior type skeletons.  Second wave blue mix of SKs and clerics.  Same with third wave.  Fourth wave was three blue skeletons per spawn with a mix of SKs and clerics.<br />
<br />
For all the above work, including a fairly tough third wave boss we got terrible loot.  Something maybe a level 30 person would use.  There is absolutely no way people of level who would use those items could defeat the fire ring.<br />
<br />
Well, I know some of the people visiting here completed the fire ring.  Would like to know how many waves there are past the third wave.<br />
<br />
So far I've had bad luck with Acrylia.  Hopefully this info will make it easier for others. Edited by: Manr at: 12/20/01 5:59:47 am</div></div><hr />

We were doing AE when i checked so we went on into the water since killing the Summoners wasnt doing anything.  Actived the PBAE spells and the worm/larva both attacked.  Was told by a druid friend they attack if you hand them an item (food whatever) also. <br />
<br />
Anyway worm/pupa killed...both MT !!! Minnows continued to spawn instantly....were 5 in the room.  We got them down to 1 a couple of times but back up to 4-5 almost immediately.<br />
<br />
It appears I either killed them to early or the drop isnt every time.  I'm thinking it has to be the first since all the other mobs drop key item every kill.  On a side note we tried the priest a couple of days ago also and its still down.  Makes me suspect both of these spawns are 7 days since this is the longest EQ has been up w/o a server reset since Luclin release.</div></div><hr />

Talk to him and he will give you a key  (dont have it logged sorry but it was easy to get) the key is to a captive cat held nearby. go forth and free him , he should give you the shackles in return.<br />
<br />
Good luck guys let me know how it turns out<br />
<br />
Oh i belive you will have to escort him outside and keep him alive so clear a path for him or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually what you do is stand on the plank till about 30+ skeletons have spawned.  Then you can finally hit the High Priestess.  And btw the skeletons come about every 10-15 seconds towards the end...Plus about every other one is immune to dazzle, hit fast as hell and have decent HPs.  So after you do this and manage to kill the priest then you loot another key and free the cat.  Only the cat is KOS to the dungeon so you better have a darn good PBAE team set up to do about 3 dungeon sweeps in front or at least 3 good enchanters and some bards to grab agro for the tanks to get the stupid cat out of the dungeon.<br />
<br />
ie if it was as simple as giving the cat a key you can get with one question we'd be past this part long ago.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and I have to tell you all about the funniest thing that happend the other day.  We were in the room before the platform.  Our druid was the 'sacrafice' and was rooted in the shackles.  A monk in our group was exploring a bit outside.. and got agro by some Skeletons that spawned at the doorway.  He fd'd them off before they HT him.<br />
<br />
Now the funny part... The druid (who is rooted by the shackles) decides to SNARE the skeletons... they proceed to both run to him and HT him.  He dies instantly =).<br />

<br />
Doesn't the quest call for a &quot;husk?&quot;  When these transformations take place - doesn't it seem to reason (I know, stop using reason on VI quests) that the husk would drop off and be a ground spawn?  The theory of not enough time from server reset for this to happen seems sound.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Beralt</div><div class="date">01-03-02, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curious if anyone checked if these mobs are mezzable by Rapture (59 High end Mez, 24 second recast, 24 sec duration) as opposed to Dazzle.  I saw a note earlier that many are not mezzable by Dazzle.  Or if they can be AE Mezzed with Fascination.  Many of the higher end mobs are immune to stun which can make high level mobs difficult to do with pure AE, but hoping we will use AE as just added damage.  This quest sounds fun.<br />

As you see there is a summoned larva inside a summoned hatchling inside a summoned wurm. None of them were targetable - blue conning to lvl 60.<br />
Conclusion: The wurm grows.<br />
But some moron AE'd the wurm and killed it - 26 hours later it still hadn't repopped. The basin is filled with 'wurmbait minnows' - should be the feed for the wurm.<br />
There are two possibilities I see now:<br />
a) The wurm keeps on growing till t is a summoned burrower (due to the many patches and the killing of it I cannot confirm it on my server).<br />
b) You somehow make him targetable - either by killing all minnows or handing him the correct food (maybe a drop off of the minnows). Tried handing him regular food and was promptly attacked by the minnows (hide handin didn't work) - no reaction though.<br />
Maybe even a combination of these two possibilities.<br />
Could someone from a server that has a wurm up since last patch without kill confirm the status of the wurm?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First we put an enchanter on the plank.  I would suggest this to everyone since they do no practical damage, can still target ppl pretty well for buffs and can stun (altho some skells unstunnable) if one slips by as a last minute save.<br />
<br />
Priest repopped twice on us.  First time we tried with 2 groups but only 1 WAR and ended up w/ respawn in the room, high priest and a couple of skels....BUT the good part is i've been there before and priest depopped till next patch so maybe that part is fixed.  And after we killed priest a new one came back up immediately.<br />
<br />
Now for the cat.  Handed in key (no rent lore btw) and had either 3 or 4 skels with that 650 HT pop ( i was then enchaner on the plank so guess what happened to me).  I was told the cat moved out the FD while skels and grimys repopped.  Has anyone gotten past this part or gotten the cat out of the city area?  It appears you could do it over and over but it was late so we bagged it for the nite.  Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

So far I have all the pieces but for the shackles and the Burrower, killed the High Priest and recieved the  key to hand into the  Cat  but my group was tired and we disbanded to do another day , but I had myself killed so the no drop no rent key is still on my corpse that is good for 24 hours of online time, probably go back to finish it tonight. As for the Burrower i have seen 5 stages  1) Hatchling 2) larva 3) Pupai  4) Worm 5) Crawler  and our server keeps reseting before the next stage. Each stage changed almost at exactly 24 hours  each day after the server reset. Can anyone confirm if there is another stage between  the Crawler and the Burrower?</div></div><hr />

I'll try it casue I'm tired of this 7 day bs to</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there two routes that end with the same reward?<br />
<br />
1.  General's box route where you gather the 8 items from the mines in grimling and from acrylia.  Turn this in, get the final &quot;big&quot; battle resulting in a key.<br />
<br />
2.  Complete the 3 scout quest battles, turn in the medals in the chest to the Captain, get the map, turn in the map for the final &quot;big&quot; battle resulting in a key.<br />
<br />
If this is true, why would anyone do the first quest?  The second is much easier IMO.  I have the four pieces from the mines in grimling and one of the medallions from the scount quests.  A group of 3/4 (60cleric, 60ranger, 60warrior, 60enchanter)(varied by LD.)  did these parts.  I know we would need more at the point where we have to defend two camps, but for the most part this can be done with one solid group.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas on if both these routes actually result in the same final battle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aauminki</div><div class="date">01-07-02, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Done the Priest thing several times with the following groups:<br />
<br />
60clr, 60war, 59pal, 60brd, 60enc, 60mnk (cake)<br />
60clr, 60war, 59pal, 60rog (got our asses handed to us due to clerics popping in the room)<br />
60clr, 60war, 59pal, 60brd, 60rog, 60mag (cake)<br />
<br />
I'd suggest clearing all the skeletons on the way to the &quot;city area&quot; before freeing the kitty, I would also suggest more than one group for this part as our group got entangled in a fight inside the prison and lost the cat once - other time pal/brd found out that pal/brd isn't the optimum combo to go defend/escort the cat while the rest of the group was finishing off the skeletons  .<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm very impressed by the introduction of these scripted things - very nice work VI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's not that easy. The General wants the Golden Medal of the Shar Vahl, not the Captain's map. The map lets you do the Captain's raid which results in the Silver Medal of War (see Stanly's writeup earlier in this post) and some war plans. <br />
<br />
The war plans let you do Veteran Vadrel's raid, which may or may not be the one that gives the medal for the final &quot;big&quot; battle. No one has managed to complete it yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we handed the key to the cat ALL of the skeletons in the lava room respawned and either 3 or 4 popped in the cat room.  Did you have this experience also?<br />
<br />
And were the group combinations you gave all the people you had?  That seems like very few if everything comes after the cat but maybe enuff if the cat moves slow?<br />
<br />
Finally as above did the cat FD at the entrance to the lava room or did he continue on to the front entrance and how did you get the shackles from him (ie do they just appear in the persons slot who gave him the key?)...hmm..that leads to does the person who hands the key have to live?</div></div><hr />

<br />
what is odd is a grimling soulkeeper   dropped a grimling souls stone of some sort  no drop  lore no rent just before cat poofed ..  I left it on a corpse waiting on a word of what I should do with it.  Ive never seen a soulkeeper in Acrylia so I hope its for the shackle in some way.</div></div><hr />

From reading it seems we have freed the cat from the jail but no one has flat said YES..i have shackle and this is how I got it.  If you have please let us know.  Its not like the priest part isnt redoable now that he pops back up immediately..;/</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't recommend handing in your box until the patch wednesday which hopefully fixes it. For one thing if you so much as aggro one of the Veterans by accident the quest will loop for hours and hours, wasting all the work put into getting the box. <br />
<br />
Also none of the grimling camps have respawned yet (or Veteran Cullin I believe) since failing the war a few days ago.<br />

<br />
Little info on the war is this: All grimling that spawn in the waves are blue to 60. They are a new breed of grimling. Battle Priests, Possessors, Deathdealers, and some other version of the skull spliter. You gotta defend 3 camps from god knows how many waves of grimlings. Waves are 6 spawns per minute per camp. Possessors charmed half my party and things fell apart fast. <br />
Npc aggro is not a problem after clearingthe initial camp, mobs all aggro'd us as the spawned. Unfortunately between the Possossors charming and the Cadverists casting that 20 sec necro stun on everyone we were never able to mount an effetive defense. <br />
This war &gt; 10th ring war imo.  (and ya I've won the 10th ring war)<br />
<br />
So now then, does anyone remember what veteran Collin is supposed to recieve to stop the quest?</div></div><hr />

In comparison, the ring of fire spawns 3 skeletons per 120 seconds after wave 3.  Here you have 3 waves of 6 spawns per minute.  Ouch.</div></div><hr />

Clicking on the drawbrige does nothing, not even a message.  And clicking on the lever outside also does nothing.  The text from nearby grimlings says the switch has been disabled.<br />
<br />
The key is likely used on the statue in the room next to the sacrifice platform.  It gives a locked message when clicked on and cannot be picked.<br />
<br />
It's possible that when someone uses the key to teleport inside a lever inside will open the drawbridge to let his fellows in.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that the drawbridge never opens.  Meaning, unless it's a group key, everyone will need a key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just found myself with a few minutes to burn and thought I'd stop by, throw in a few comments and solicit a little feedback...<br />
<br />
This event is intentionally much more difficult than the rest of the encounters in the zone. <br />
<br />
There are some spells that certain AA abilities will help to overcome. <br />
<br />
The rewards for victory will be commensurate with the challenge. <br />
<br />
If something seemed broken, please feel free to email me with specifics and I'll take a look. <br />
<br />
Just curious, but how many people participated for the failed attempt(s)?<br />

<br />
We recently gave this a serious attempt with 38 people. Unfortunately for us one of the veterans at the main camp (must be at least 40 grimlings there) died before we could even experience the main waves. I've been meaning to rant about this for a good while, but why exactly do the veterans have jack for hp? They can hardly survive going toe to toe against 2 grimlings let alone once they aggro 8+ at the main encampment. Yes yes I know that's part of the &quot;challenge&quot; but we had about 15 people at the main camp and the graphics lag of 40+ grimlings all charging us and the veterans at the same time was so immense for a lot of us that we couldn't even target grimlings to pull them off of the veterans in time. This was a silly idea imo, resting the &quot;challenge&quot; on having to protect a low hp mob from a zergling force of 40 grimlings. The solution? Leave veterans kufur and fhelik as they are, but give shiktan and cullin some more hp and a few more levels. From a roleplaying standpoint it only makes sense to give us the two of their strongest veterans at the main encampment. <br />
<br />
And secondly, from what i've read from people lucky enough to have veterans shiktan and cullin survive the initial main camp break, there are enchanter and necro mobs as parts of the attacking waves? This isn't fair at all. Firstly, fearless isn't going to make or break the raid if this is the case. Secondly, it's too damn easy for chanter/necro npcs to land their mezzes and charms on players. Not to mention their slows and such which are just as pathetically easy to land on a player with their MR at 200ish.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just some ideas to throw out there<br />

<br />
In our try for this war we had i think about 45 to 50 ppl.<br />
We did not tho know where the Veterans was going to lead us and so on. So much will be improved to next try...sadly the burrower almost never comes up before patch and we also have other guild(s) fighting for that pop.<br />
It was quite imposible for us since they necro stuned/mezzed/feared us and before the first one ran of u got a new and so on til u was dead =( I hope we get a new burrower son so we can try it again... but first thought after our first try was &quot;buggy quest npcs&quot; indeed.<br />

Specifically what camps in grimling need to be protected? Does the whole camp respawn with the new grimling types? <br />
<br />
My thinking here is to go count the number of grimlings in each camp that needs to be protected and place a person in front of each spawn point.<br />
<br />
I have not fought this war yet, trying to get as much information before we start the war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Feressa</div><div class="date">01-30-02, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here are a few things that occurred to me after failing the war last weekend:<br />
Targeting is without a doubt the most critical element. This war deals with fairly small creatures running around a hilly terrain, very different from 12ft giants advancing across the plain in Great Divide. And the nature of their attacks means that a lag of a second or two in acquiring a target will be rewarded with complete failure rather than one or two deaths. it would be an idea for the enchanters and bards to make a '/tar a_grimling_possessor' hotkey and keep hitting it.<br />
One strategy for dealing with the possessors is to get them mezzed, then break mez while keeping them under 100% stun-lock. That means your force is going to have to be co-ordinated, with the melees making sure an enchanter is there to stun it before breaking mez. This means DON'T just go around whacking the mobs.<br />
Handling events when people get charmed is going to be difficult, though charming the possessor and casting an AE mem-blur might be worth a try.<br />
<br />
This is certainly a very different type of raid to any others, and just needs people to work out new tactics. The time-based difficulty of getting the husk is one major problem, as it limits the chances people have of getting to the point of trying out tactics. The low HP on the Veterans is another serious issue that could be altered without changing the fundamental difficulty of the encounter.</div></div><hr />

I've recieved dozens of emails, read them all, and only had time to answer a handful. I guess if I solicit input in the future I'll have some kind of autoreply to ensure that noone feels totally ignored.<br />
<br />
I'll be making a couple of minor adjustments to the raid but overall I'm pretty comfortable with the event as is, at least for the time being. It took many attempts before anyone was able to complete the Tenth ring war, and that took around 100 people (far fewer now). Some of the emails indicated that in GF there have been a few near misses already with less than 50. I'm confident that in time, different tactics will be employed and this event too will be overcome.<br />
<br />
If I didn't reply to you personally it didn't mean that your email went unread. In addition to making sure the existing quests are working properly, we're all working harder than ever to create newer, and better content.<br />

IMO Akkirus is one helluva guy for asking us for feedback and taking alot of time to answer what emails he could. I have NEVER, in 3 years, seen a dev/gm come in and solicit opinions and feedback on something he designed. He has also been posting on the dev boards at everquest.com.<br />
<br />
I am not defending him to be a brown-noser, but it looks to me like we have a dev with a sincere interest in what he has created, to make sure it is working properly and is enjoyable.<br />

The General says he drops an Oblisk which is half of the key, and that you are to turn in this item, and the battle plans to him to recieve he key.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kelarniv Mistweb</div><div class="date">02-03-02, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just lost the war on Lanys T'Vyl this friday. The zone is now blatantly bugged- many grimling camps have no mobs, are waving a vah shir flag, and the three camps involved in the war have 6 grimlings spawning every minute and promptly depopping. Also, Captain Necin isn't up in the outpost due to a bug, so we can't work one route to a trigger. GMs refuse to do anything. I personally don't see why they can't repop an obviously bugged zone like they have before, but no use talking about that here.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, the actual war is pretty buggy. Grimlings cast lure mez/fear/charm spells, which isn't a bug and is fine, but- many times when the fear is cast on you, you'll lose all contact with reality. Nobody can see your typing, you can't see anyone's typing, your point of view won't move (though you'll still see the grimling beating on you from wherever he cast the spell, usually WAY out of melee range), you can't even /q. Not only that, but when the fear wears off you STILL can't move or do anything. I'm sorry if my explanation is unclear but you've got to see it to understand it. I wouldn't reccomend anyone to trigger the war at it's current stage- there is honestly no way to beat an army of mobs that permanently neutralizes a team member with one spell.<br />
<br />
Akkirus, can you look into the various bugs with Grimling Mesmerize, Grimling Possession, and especially Grimling Death Chant? Also, we had a strange worldkick bug- a minute or so after we triggered, before we fought anything, a third of our raid or so got kicked to character select.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This depends a lot on the strength and class makeup of your people.  The preliminary portion of the High Priest (where someone's trapped on the gangplank, etc.) is pretty trivial with 2 groups of 60s, as is the High Priest himself.  The second part, where you free the cat, will require more, but how many more is dependent on your class breakdown.  We did it with 4 groups of mostly 60s.  We also failed miserably with 2 groups of 60s, but that was our first try, so may have been due to surprise more than anything else.  To guarantee success, I'd recommend 24-30, especially if it's your first time running this script.<br />
