        Interviews</b></font></strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">We recently got the opportunity to 
        ask some questions from one of Verant's recent acquisitions, John Capozzi 
        (aka Kendrick). </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">You've recently taken a position at Verant. 
        What exactly do you do there? </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        My title is Associate Cabana Boy. I am tasked with mixing frozen tropical 
        confections, changing towels, keeping the strange floating objects out 
        of the pool, and being extra nice to the female octogenarian guests. Oh, 
        wait. That was my old job. My NEW job is Associate Game Designer, EQ Live. 
        What that means is that instead of creating drinks and playing a lot of 
        shuffleboard, I create content and play a lot of shuffleboard. </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Now that the world of EQ has been stabilized 
        for awhile, did the game turn out the way you thought it would be? </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        I had a pretty clear picture how the game would be early in beta. I didn't 
        expect that it would be quite this popular, we're getting close to half 
        a million units sold now, which is pretty damned impressive. Just like 
        anyone else who plays the game, I can find things to fault about EQ, but 
        if you step back and look at the game as a whole, it's a masterpiece. 
        And we are working hard to correct a lot of those perceived faults. EQ 
        isn't done yet and that is one of the great things about it. As long as 
        we can keep power to the servers, we can improve the game, and fully intend 
        to. </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Can you tell us anything about the upcoming 
        Rogue uber-weapon (ie: the Rogue Fiery Avenger)? </font> </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        Well, yes, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. I can say 
        that all the class quests are in the final stages of testing at this time. 
        That means they will be in..soon. </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Do you agree that many of the planes 
        items are quite underpowered with the addition of so many easier to obtain 
        Kunark items? Any chance that any of these items might get an upgrade?</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        That's a given. We've got Velious to get out the door first, then we fully 
        intend to go back in and retune the Planes. That includes the difficulty 
        of the ultimate encounters in there, as well as revamping the equipment. 
        </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Are there any plans to make 'Detect Traps' 
        more applicable? For example, identifying floor traps? </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick]</font> 
        <font color="#FF0000">We've got an idea we're working on right now that 
        will make Sense and Disarm Traps work just like a player would expect. 
        And traps to use them on. Game wide. How's that for a teaser? ;) </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying they are going to actually 
        be ADDING traps to the current world? Will they be changing the few current 
        ones to actually do damage? </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        We've rethought the concept of traps, or rather, someone here had an epiphany 
        that should make traps do what they traditionally do in RPG's. It's still 
        in the concept stage at this point, but to partially answer you question, 
        Sense Traps will sense traps and disarm traps will disarm traps, and traps 
        will be a lot more..dynamic. </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>[<font color="#FFFFFF">Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Would there ever be a chance to change 
        the 'consideration' command to accurately report if a mob can see you 
        or not? For example, why would a mob be 'scowling' at me if he can't even 
        see me? </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        It is a quirk with the way factions are set up. Factions work on yours 
        and the target's race, in addition to any faction assigned to the mob. 
        Any mob tagged "no faction" will tend to scowl even if they can't see 
        you. We can't go through and change all "no faction" to some faction, 
        for a number of reasons. Besides, to me, it's one of the cooler parts 
        of mastering the class, learning what can and can't see you. There should 
        be no absolutes. </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Will 'apply poison' ever be changed to 
        a 'time based' skill instead of a 'failure' skill? </font> </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        Apply will most likely remain the way it is from now on. </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Any chance for having more than just 
        the standard stat modifiers for weapons or armor? I would enjoy seeing 
        a weapon with a 'Attack + 15' or a shield with 'Defense + 10'. Other suggestions 
        could include 'Movement + 15' or 'Piercing + 5'. </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        That is an idea I like too, and brought up a few times. The system doesn't 
        really support direct skill boosts via equipment, and would be very difficult 
        to implement. </font></b> </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Is everquest ever thinking about a 'Everquest 
        Newsletter' or something that will describe ongoing GM quests? I still 
        don't understand the entire storylines on the 'Lifting of the Veil' for 
        Kunark, nor the connection between the Plane of Fear, Lanys T'Vil and 
        Kithicor Forest. And with Velious coming up, I would like to understand 
        what is happening. </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick]</font> 
        <font color="#FF0000">I'm with you on that 100 percent. One of those faults 
        I mentioned above, to my mind, was the limited depth to the world, and 
        no real place to go for a good solid dose of backstory. Keep an eye on 
        the Everquest.com webpage, there should be more content in the near future 
        that will address a lot of the above. And we're working hard on making 
        the world more vivid while ingame, with expanded dialogues, more "local 
        color", and an ever increasing staff of Quest Troupe members to further 
        animate the game. I feel strongly that if you "live" in Norrath, there 
        should be a wealth of information available for you to absorb, just to 
        ground you in the world. </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">[Safehouse] 
        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">What are your thoughts on "twinking"? 
        For example, a level 5 Rogue decked out in full ravenscale wielding a 
        Trak tooth. Can anything be done about it? Or should anything be done 
        at all? </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FF0000">[Kendrick] 
        I don't like twinking. But twinking is not going to go away. That's about 
        all I can say. </font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks Kendrick!</font></p>
