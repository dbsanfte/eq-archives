Takes 2 minutes to get back to PoK rather than 10-15 min running through several zones.  In plane of fire and no wizards to AE TL and not enough druids to port everyone out?  Duel and use OT hammer.

1)  Drops you in a zone where there is a PoK book conveniently located a few hundred yards away.<br />
<br />
2)  Normally only takes a few seconds to proc (normally 10-20 with dex up around 200).<br />
<br />
I've used it mostly when a PoK book is more then 2-3 zones over and a druid or wizzy wasn't around for a port/tl (use it all the time to get out of HoT, DN, WW, The Hole, Old Sebilis, City of Mist). Very convenient for self porting after a raid and there's only one druid left and 7 people.<br />

What I have been doing is getting a non-KOS friend to spam HAIL the captain so that be turns around and faces the same direction that his army does.  I stand up right behind his army with sneak on (almost shoulder to shoulder) and hand him the braids.  I have done this twice and turned in about 50 braids with no aggro.  Pay attention to who you are giving the braid to, it is really easy to give it to one of his soldiers by accident. [61 Assassin] Crobarr (Barbarian) <br />

it is simply superb way for melees to get about.  hit a mob, proc, kill 1 skelly and you are 1 min away from a book.  from any zone in the game.<br />
if the sh*t is hitting the fan, whip out your OT hammer and /discipline riposte and pray.<br />
<br />
i have zoned into fear, as a solo warrior, to check if cazic thule is up. Run around invis / sowed for as long as i could to look for CT, then turned round and procced out on all the mobs beating on me.<br />
<br />
yes, i am kos to OT, but i still use it all the time. proc in, run up to the right at the city wall. kill the one skelly, then just be careful walking out to book (some dragoons/  general run faster than sow).<br />
<br />
Also, you can be i think the ONLY person to gate out of a plane of air raid.  Watch the rest of them try to gate / port then end  up just jumping of the islands.  Be super cool, and just proc out.  OT hammer allows you to gate out of air.  I do not know anything else that lets you gate out of air.<br />
<br />
For every day AND emergency use, i fully endorse the OT hammer.<br />
Do the sneak thing, do the charm thing, use puppet strings, whatever, just get your OT hammer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemac Dushae</div><div class="date">06-20-03, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What likely happened is that you got hit with the semi-old hide/sneak trade bug.<br />
<br />
Around about the time that the new UI became the standard UI, SOE changed how the secret handshake works.  You used to hide and sneak behind a mob and open the trade window.  Click trade and *poof* trade at indifferent faction.<br />
<br />
Now a-days if you still have hide active when you open the trade window, you are unhidden and unsnuck.  Your faction goes to KoS and you get turned into fertilizer.<br />
<br />
To correctly use the secret handshake you MUST click off hide before opening the trade window.  So long as you are still behin dthe mob, you still stay snuck and indifferent.  Complete your trade and then reapply hide.<br />
<br />
This is not only for the OT hammer, it also applies to any other KoS hand-in... like you know... that General guy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
second thing...can i just skip this braids thing completly and just turn in the jade completely to the guy and get the hammer...and if so..would i need the help of another class to charm him to do this..<br />

This works if you want to bank in a KoS area, if you're fast you can drop hide, open the window, then re-hide before you aggro.<br />
<br />
Sneaking-trading will not work for the OT hammer since your faction remains indifferent when you are behind the mob.  If someone else charms him, you will be amiable (need higher faction, warmly I believe).  If you have someone charm him, you can use items (ie everquest.allakhazam.com/...?item=5695 ) to raise you faction to do the turn in.  Most people end up using puppet strings or the ornate velium pendant to finish this quest.</div></div><hr />

Go here for info and good links, Mooriarty got his hammer at 55 level using Puppet strings, I am currently doing braids for my halfling Ranger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main's a 65 chanter and I've helped several friends get this hammer.  I just wanted to point out that it doesn't help if the enchanter charms the mob, unless it's the enchanter who needs the hammer.  (I got mine that way, why not?  Basically a free gate to OT item if you can cast charm)  If the enchanter charms a mob, it's only indifferent to others and you need Amiable to do the quest.  <br />
<br />
I go with a friend who has puppet strings ready, I tash the skeletal foreman, root it and friend charms it and quickly hands in the Jade.  You don't need to dawdle because as someone said earlier, he's very magic resistant.<br />
<br />
I'd do this at the shore btw, every time I've done it out near the PoK book we've had cliff golems and DE's swarm.  Fun but takes awhile to kill them all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm super KoS now, but got the hammer before ruining my faction.  I am able to hide about 95% of the time before aggro'ing the skeleton there and have only once died from a dragoon whom I swear must have been SoW'd because he out ran me with Run3.</div></div><hr />

Raise your charisma to as high as you can when using the puppet strings.  This seems to help a bit with the resists.  I wasted 6 charges at the wonderfully high 65 charisma that halflings get, but was able to get him easily with 1 charge at 180 charisma.  Just something to take into consideration.<br />
<br />
I agree with everyone though.  The OT hammer is definitely nice if you are in a raiding guild.  I never had a problem with porting into OT and I am max KoS.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wristie</div><div class="date">11-17-03, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that some people are geting the idea you can simply sneak behind the Undead Foreman and hand him a jade and *presto* it's &quot;Hammer Time&quot;.  THis is NOT true.<br />
<br />
When sneaking behind a quest NPC your faction is Indifferent.  That is NOT high enough to do this quest.  I tried this more than once just to satisfy myself that it was true.  (By the way, with indiff. faction he simply eats the Jades and you get nothing back.  Of course I killed him and took back my jades, but that's another matter...) ;)<br />
<br />
The reason you can sneak behind the Skeleton Captain (using some of the techniques described above) and do the braids hand in is that you only need Indifferent faction to do the braid turn-in.<br />
<br />
I also had a chanter (level 63) charm the Undead Foreman for me, but even charmed I was not able to do the turn-in -- my faction was still not high enough - and that included having a Bard in my group to sing faction song... (I'm max KoS btw).<br />
<br />
Puppet strings SHOULD work, because your own pet (in this case the Undead Foreman) is amiable to you - and that's enough to do the quest. :)<br />

<br />
The OT hammer is actually the reason that they changed coding so that pets won't equip NO DROP weapons a few years ago.<br />
<br />
My evil twin discovered that having a mob gate out of its zone to the OT does... bad things... to the zone  <br />
<br />
Basically it causes an instant zonecrash, with all the assorted fun things that go with that occurance.  He discovered the bug/feature by accident and showed it to a GM, who initially didn't believe him...<br />
<br />
*wack* *wack*  *wack* !PROC!  CRAAAAAASH<br />
<br />
Very convincing demonstration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Puppet strings are the easiest/safest way to do the turn in KOS - have a chanter CHA buff the KOS player and tash/mez the foreman - then charm with the puppet strings.  Watchout for the BardGuard (Selo?) tho - he's hella fast and can be annoying on the foreman pull unless harmonied/pacified.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_SWheaton</div><div class="date">11-19-03, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is the braids quest to fix faction is best done 30-45 when you can get exp from it in OT. Its only when you get to 50+ that you realise the value of the item. Planning ahead is the key here, and knowing the quests in the zones you hunt in.<br />
<br />
If you cant sneak or charm to hand in Braids, you need puppet strings to do the jade handin directly to the UD Foreman. Handing in the braids can take forever if you have a good deity, I might add, as illusions/masks don’t help your faction much.<br />
