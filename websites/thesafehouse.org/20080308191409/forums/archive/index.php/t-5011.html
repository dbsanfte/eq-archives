<br />
40 Thrust<br />
46 Env (buffable to 50)<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
50 Thrust<br />
35 Env (probably buffable to about 40ish)<br />

I guess the question is: For RvR is Dragonfang going to be used enough to make sacrificing Lifebane worthwhile?<br />

First of all, thats disgusting.  No wonder SBs and NSs are jealous.  Hmmm.... I like it....no...I LOVE it!   <br />

I believe RR 3 is +2.  You'd need to hit RR 5 to get +4.<br />

Thats a nice spec ya got there, but it seems just a little too high.  What are your base stats?</div></div><hr />

But lets have a look:<br />
Infiltrator gets till Level 50 3706 Skill Pts.<br />
<br />
Your Char:<br />
50 Thrusting : 1274 SP<br />
50 Stealth : 1274 SP<br />
40 Envenom: 819 SP<br />
41 CS : 860 SP<br />
20 DW: 209 SP<br />
<br />
Total: 4436 SP<br />
<br />
You spent 730 SP more than you get.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you mixed something up and you just got Stealth till 40 but then you wont reach 41 CS too. You just would raise it till 39 and no DW.<br />

Hell.. my natural stealth is 39!!!!  will be 50 with adds!  49 currently.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aach</div><div class="date">04-06-02, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have dragonfang style but I've only once ever managed to use a style that chained off evade (and whenever I'm forced into a stand up fight I try).  Granted I'm only at about 50k RP but there are good reasons for it:<br />
<br />
1) in RvR its often several of them onto you (reduced defence and dificult to time the style)<br />
2) enemy players use styles that give a bonus to hit (reduced chance to evade)<br />
3) If there are many players near by you'll be slightly laged. <br />
4) Many oponants move arround and so you'll only land 2 out of 3 blows (so will they but it screws reactive styles).<br />
4) After the fight begins you rarely have more than 3 blows before you've been shot / nuked / stuned / petted to death.<br />
<br />
The CS style which chains off evade is excelent because it adds to your defence does lots of damage and is low ish stamina - that means that if you have 3 oponants you get improved defence against all of them rather than just a stun against one of them (once).<br />
<br />
Dragonfang would not get a place on my hotbar if it were a L30 thrust style.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">04-06-02, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also, with 3 guys beating on you, one evade on any of them, you target them and dragonfang so he's stunned.  you can then use the crit chain on them because they have not attacked you again yet.  If you watch who's attacking you, you can actually stun more than one of the opponents if you are quick.<br />
<br />
I also am going for dragonfang and lifebane.  It's really not that difficult to do now that more envenom items have turned up.  With a thrusting frenzy, regal gloves and a virulent fish-hook that's already +9.  Add in another 3 for RR4 and I only need envenom trained to 38 to use lifebane.  Granted it takes some swapping around of equipment while I apply the poison, but that's not too big of a deal.  I only need to train my stealth to 36 to get it up to 50.  Really the only thing being sacrificed is the additional max damage from taking CS higher.  That's a loss I am willing to accept for the benefit of the poison and high weapon spec/dragonfang</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can kill a yellow tank easly one on one.... I MIGHT ask for you to have the +env weapon equiped to use the applied poison. <br />
<br />
With 2.5 it is way to easy for infs to get 50 in stealth weapon and envenom and also get DW past half. I think the ability to use level 50 poisons basically for free with item, able to boost other stats while using them isn't right.<br />
<br />
this would go for all the thief classes.<br />

I get a critical on a perforate like 1 in 500 times.  I get hit by tanks with 2-handers for more damage than I could do to them with my &quot;one-shot&quot; hidden-only position-based attack... with an anytime style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also crit hits on caster bolts and Perforate are leading to one shots, something mythic made clear they want to reduce.. A equal shadowblade who Perfed me with a 2handed could probably almost kill me if he gets a crit off. <br />
<br />
I just don't think we need this to do our job effectivly and still reduces one hit shots... we don't RELY on crit hits to kill our targets, but when it does happen it is a bit too powerful. <br />
<br />
Yes i get decimated from thanes 4 levels under me in 2 hits from a 2 handed sword, but i expect that. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">04-08-02, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where was it stated that we weren't &quot;intended to be a tank-killing class&quot;?  I have seen statements like that (also &quot;we are intended to be an archer killing class&quot;) but never any source.  (An aside: I happen to disagree with both; I get a bonus to people in chain, negatives to people in reinforced.  For big strikes like Perforate Artery, armor/weapon bonuses/penalties make a huge difference.)<br />
<br />
If all the circumstances are in my favor (I am hidden with envenomed weapons and set up my strike properly), I should have a better-than-50/50 chance to win.  If everything is in the tank's favor (they see me coming and we fight toe-to-toe in the open), he should have a better-than-50/50 chance to win.  Currently, the former is that I have a 50/50 chance at most, the latter is I have an infintesimal chance.<br />
<br />
Also, a Thane is a light tank.  They don't have the same offense/defense as a Warrior/Armsman/Hero, and they happen to wear chain, which thrust gets a bonus to.  Maybe if your definition of &quot;tank&quot; wasn't so broad, I would agree.  However, balance is already shifted so far towards ranged attacks (archers and robes), asking for melee nerfs seems way out of place.  I am not a staunch opponent of nerfs, and recognise they are needed sometimes, but in this case I have to strongly disagree.  Assassins are not overpowered, though we have some very unique abilities in our highly-concentrated (one-target) offense and very weak defense.<br />
<br />
PS: Since when has &quot;caster survivability&quot; been a concern?  They are second only to archers in popularity – and pretty even in PvP strength – on my server, and those of others I have spoken to.  Assassins are pretty much the only ones who can get close enough to kill them before being turned into a smoking crater, victorious army charges notwithstanding.

With my abilities right now, i think i would be able to kill him 100% of the time with my envenom even at 42... but i will do more testing.<br />
<br />
Main reason i dont like crit strikes is the SB's ability to oneshot equal con casters and remain hidden with a 2 handed crit. Mythic really wants to cut down one shots from and toward casters, and the majority on one shots in the same level range are coming from 2 handed SB's. But i don't want to ask SB's damage output to be nurfed, this is the reason they only got 2.2 spec.. removing crit hits though would cut down quite a few of the one shots. <br />
<br />
Another way to do it though is give assasins better detect hidden so they can actually defend against enemy thieves.  Right now 2 level 50's with max tealth have to be withing a 5 pace radius more than 3 second at a time to unconver each other... <br />
<br />
still sticking to haveing to keep + env item equipped tho.. you chose not to spec high in envenom so you should not reap the benifits without giving up something else. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">04-08-02, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would cut down on about 1 in 500 one-shots; it would just be yet another little niggling nerf (like not being able to stealth while mezzed... yeah that was so overpowered, and mez/stun isn't... heh).  I have 54k RPs and have only ever gotten a critical PA on a player three times: twice it was like 100 extra damage, the other it was a 250-pt crit on top of a 605 PA because the person was blue and sitting.  The former were not one-shots, the latter was.  865 is still lower than what Shadowblades can do without a crit, but more power to 'em.<br />
<br />
I agree that +Env items should have to remain equipped.  I also think that's the wrong boat to be rocking: +Env items letting us use higher-level poisons is already different from any other skill, and fairly powerful. Edited by: Valarauco at: 4/8/02 12:48:42 pm</div></div><hr />

Nerf is what it is. You can't petition to have crits taken away from our first critical strike opener because ONE of the 3 classes can one shot people all the time. That has always been the case, even WITHOUT crits man. SB's with full sword/CS cap in the 900's, you mean to tell me that won't kill any caster out there WITHOUT a crit? Come on now, if anything, SB's need to have a cap added to their perforate artery. Don't punish all assassin classes because some well specced SB is decimating people.... That is what happened with archers and look where they are now. Envenom items having to be equipped in order to use that level poison will take a complete recoding that Mythic will not do. Why should they? You know how hard it is to get those items with the big envenom bonuses? If we can acquire the BEST loot in the game, why should we be penalized? Sheesh, and me vs. an equal level tank is a 50/50, always, unless I run and come back for another perforate artery.</div></div><hr />

I know several SB's on Percival and all of them that have high sword/CS can one shot just about any yellow caster standing. Why should we not have the ability to critical hit just as much as any other person out there? Your reasoning for removing them is totally wrong. SB's one shot people because of their 2 hander delay. That is why they get 2.2 spec points, they can use a 2h, and leftaxe is actually worthwhile for them to train. It isn't a crap shoot training that like it is dual wield, as it always swings no matter what. Also, an equal level SB has a lot more hits than me, depending on the race/attribute distribution. Straight up fights, SB's destroy infiltrators because of these factors. We get more spec points to try to compensate for SB's doing more damage than us I thought? We can try and even it up with other skills, as they outdamage us in a straight melee fight. Edited by: pervalidus at: 4/8/02 1:24:15 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, what change to Envenom?  As it is, you have to keep the items equipped for the venom to proc if the poison you are using is within 2 levels (lower) of you.<br />
<br />
If that were changed, we couldn't venom other people's weapons.  Another little unnecessary nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_3DKnight</div><div class="date">04-08-02, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's easy to get the items with persistence. the +5 env jewel takes maybe 5 hours of fighting in a big high level group in DF from your share of seals, the thruster took me 3 hours, not very long.. there are a ton running around with 2 thrusters... add +2 from realm bonus and you can easy get your max in + env.. it's not that bad. I am very VERY against +env item switch offs. If you want to use level 50 poison you have to give something up for it I’m sorry, right now you can just train to 38, get the items and ALSO get the bonuses from the items you use when you have done applying to your weapons. If you want to use that 50 through items that’s fine, but give up those other stat bonuses for it. <br />
<br />
you said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Envenom items having to be equipped in order to use that level poison will take a complete recoding that Mythic will not do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually no, it in effect when you poison other peoples weapons right now, this stops a level 50 power leveling a level 10 with lifebane.  <br />
<br />
It’s not a nurf.. it called balancing, which is my job. I play my Infiltrator full time and I have to remain impartial. I have screamed at the devs for months to get us fixed when they gave me 2 weeks in beta to test our class, and now I’m asking them to pull back a bit.  <br />
<br />
As for cirt hits, do you rely on them to do your job? If so your not playing right.. how much REAL damage to the class will this do? Not much I am guessing… but I am waiting on my fights with the Warrior TL to confirm my suspicions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_pervalidus</div><div class="date">04-08-02, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have to add another fact that you are overlooking. Shadowblades use slash for both axes and swords. They get a bonus against leather and cloth....another reason they hit much harder, since most infiltrators/nightshades are thrust/pierce specced. We do better against Midgard and Hibernian chain wearers. Ask a shadowblade how many times he has killed an even con cleric or paladin/armsman one on one. I bet it isn't many. Weapon type vs. armor is a huge factor to consider in one on one fights. You should probably do a little more research into your report before submitting it. I chose thrust over slash so I would get that bonus against chain. Figured that with that I may be able to take some tanks one on one, and half the time I can. One on ones also happen how often in rvr? Remember, this game isn't about pvp, it is about rvr. Warriors are a hurting class and everyone knows it. Try putting your infiltrator up against a skald if you are really going to test. Instas sure make a difference. Or, if it is a warrior, try a shield spec. He lands that shield stun on you and you are finished. I really don't see your argument about us being pretty powerful. We are good against the right target, same as any class. If we miss CD against a hib caster, they quickcast stun and we are toast. If we pick our targets/situations well, we can win. Isn't that how our class is supposed to work? /shrug</div></div><hr />

While it is true that most players would chew glass before admitting they have something that should be taken away, in this case I believe you are wrong.  <br />
<br />
The changes you propose would not have much of an impact; they'd simply be annoying, much like several other nerfs to the assassin class in recent history.  However, the fact that they wouldn't have much of an impact (&quot;you don't rely on them&quot;) is not a valid defense for their implementation.<br />
<br />
If there is something that is making assassins overpowered, let the other classes report it.  I have not heard any complaints: people seem satisfied that an assassin that gets the drop on someone is likely to win, but an assassin that is found out is likely to die.  That fits the general populace's expectation.<br />

They are a bonus...just like any other class gets them. Do casters rely on them? Do berzerkers? I'd say the same argument applies to them as well. I have been one shot by a spear hero with a crit so I guess they should have them removed too. See my point here? Envenom, I agree, should require the items to be equipped. Misunderstood what you were saying. Thought you meant we should have to have natural envenom at that level to use the poison, heh. Just don't want you going after the wrong things in order to balance us out.   <br />

<br />
1) Do you ask for player feedback on your reports in a visible location (say, the Safehouse DAoC Main Hall)?<br />
<br />
2) If you assert that it is your job as Infiltrator TL to maintain balance, why are you suggesting changes based on Shadowblade abilities?<br />
<br />
PS: It is my understanding that Lifebane will not proc unless you have 50 Env while you swing the thus-envenomed weapon.  Major Insidious Venom (45) will work for someone level 47 or higher regardless of their Envenom spec (or even assassin-hood). Edited by: Valarauco at: 4/8/02 2:25:30 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Critical hits do exactly what they are supposed to do: extra damage, sometimes obscene, but randomly and only once in a while.   If I got a max-hit-max-crit with a Garotte, it would be for 552 plus potential offhand plus potential proc.  A tank wielding a 2-hander could crit for over 800.  I don't even know what the max crit of a bolt spell would be but I'm sure it surpasses both of those.  Should crits be removed from all 2H weapons?  Bolt spells?  Should the Critical Shot ability be removed entirely?<br />
<br />
Perhaps there is an argument for crits themselves to be nerfed across the board (maybe max 50% of original hit instead of 100%), but asking for them to be removed from only CS hidden strikes is ridiculous.  I can only hope you see why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3dKnight. Have you thought about what a maximum spec CS/Weapon Shadowblade gives up for that *possibility* of one shot killing someone? Not just someone, but the lowest physically weakest character in the game, wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt. I would hope you could kill a person wearing that, with a two-handed weapon, in one swing. To have that maximum spec you loose any hope of dual poisons or any decent poison. LifeBane is a non-issue. It will never happen. They sacrifice their possibility of 81/tick to make it happen in one swing. Or die.<br />
<br />
You know, this is such a game of &quot;What class can I play that won't get nerfed&quot;. Is that really &quot;working as intended&quot;, because that's what it has become, for me.<br />
<br />
If you do this, I think everyone is simply going to be stealth/envenom/weapon/dual. Yay, diversity. I really have nothing more to say. This is the first time I have ever been disgusted on these boards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">04-08-02, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If an assassin is killing an even tank 100% of the time.. it's overpowered (Assuming the assassin get's the jump).  This may be an inf only issue, as I know I likely won't be able to manage weapon, stealth, AND envenom at 50 until fairly far in the future.  However, I don't think we should be at the mercy of any class that we get the jump on.  As is, there are certain classes that we really ought to be able to kill (Again, assuming our initial advantage) that we have no shot against.  I would give up any chance I had to kill a tank for a decent shot at killing an enemy healer.  Perhaps it's just my luck, but my realm (Hib) is the one realm whose primary healer does not have access to some form of instant cast crowd control.<br />
I would argue that our chances against anyone of even con that we get the jump on should be 50% at the least.  Given how tough it is to set up and get into position, how easy it is for you to lag out of an opener, or to miss the CD when the prey moves, how unlikely it is that you'll ever actually get a solo shot at an even con tank, with nobody to interfere...  I don't think it's a problem for us to get a decent number of those kills.<br />
If our targets are diversified, it also helps the common conception that we pick on mages.  Of course we do.  They're the only ones that we can both find, and kill.  Give us the ability to kill healers (Anything to stop that insta at least before the CD) and not only do we get more targets, but we become more important defensively, as our own realm's healers are also at risk, and need protection.  <br />
As for crits... They are so infrequent that it seems ridiculous (It amazes me how many people spell this word with the syllable &quot;red&quot;) to cut down on that lucky bonus.  I agree with Val that targeting them is a mistake, and will have next to no effect on the actual problem (SBs with really big weapons one-shotting).<br />
Also, bear in mind that what you describe as &quot;too powerful&quot; is a spec that only an infi has a chance at.  As our three classes are more closely linked than any others, please remember that a change you recommend to bring infiltrators into balance may very well be executed on the other two classes as well.  I don't regard either SBs or NSs as overly powerful.  Infis may well be (I've had some encounters with infis where I was left to simply gasp at the amount of damage their use-anytime styles seemed to be doing.  (This coming from a blades shade.  I know what the bonus against leather is like.  This was simply hittign really hard)).  I just really do not want to see us needing to climb out of another pit.  The one we were in for the first 4 months was deep enough, thank you.</div></div><hr />

not all shadowblades use 2h weapons.  over 50% of shadowblades now are mostly shadowzerkers and while the other 50% is split up with 4 or 5 spec templates and the smallest portion being critblades.<br />

just because we can use 2h weapons doesn't mean we all do.<br />

You would be getting much more negative feedback if this were on one of the forums more people read (Main Hall).<br />
<br />
Test the Envenom yourself before asking about any change: as I said, I don't want to rock that boat.  I agree that you should not be able to wear items to get to 50 env, apply Lifebane, and then take them all off... but I am 99% positive it doesn't work that way.  Poisons 2 or more levels below someone's level will proc for them regardless of their Env skill, or even if they have it at all (non-assassins).<br />
<br />
And, do you concede the point on the Critical Hits issue?  It's not that I think it's going live next patch, it's that I am bothered that you claimed you were reporting that (period) and I hadn't seen any requests for feedback.  You are one of two voices for all three assassin classes currently.  What you say matters... thus it is fairly important that the rest of us (most of us?) agree with you on some level.

<br />
The following are my UNSUBSTANTIATED OPINIONS:<br />
<br />
On the subject of Envenom - I agree.  You should be required to wear all of your +envenom items in order to poison your weapon(s) AND have it proc.<br />
<br />
Question though (has anyone tested this?):  Wear all of your +stealth items, go into stealth mode, and then remove all of your +stealth items.  Are you any easier to detect?  Do you move slower now?<br />
<br />
<br />
On the subject of &amp;lt;random&gt; critical hits - I disagree.  If you are going to remove critical hits, remove them from ALL CLASSES AT THE SAME TIME.  Otherwise your're calling for a nerf to your own class, and you still haven't provided any REAL data to substantiate that a problem exists.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally - this is off-topic for this post.  Please make a NEW TOPIC to discuss this under, and get back to the question at hand, regarding Dragonfang vs. Lifebane.<br />

Ok, how about this:  Get rid of 3' Kobolds stabbing people in the back with 6' two-handed swords.  That's like asking ME at almost 6' tall to assassinate someone with a 12' chunk of gas pipe.  Don't care how strong the kobbie is, there's no way that the momentum of swinging something twice your height isn't gonna toss you into next week.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the issue is 2-handed shadowblades one-shotting people with a PA and a random crit, then perhaps Mythic should look into WHY shadowblades in particular are doing this.  Is it because their base weapon skill is higher?  Is it because of the bonus (15%, 25%, whatever) for using two-handed weapons?<br />

Im playing a Shadowblade and I always thought that the rouges had equal problems and that all of the classes had advantages and disadvantages. Granted the Nightshades could use some sort of a boost to get on equal playing field with the other 2 classes.<br />
The issues at hand are important, but ppl claiming that SBs go around 1-hit killing all the time needs to understand that its not all that common. If we want to one-hit kill we have to go 50 weapon, 50 SC and that leaves us with 37 stealth. Enough to get over 60 in the two former and 50 in stealth, but thats all we got. We haven't gotten any envenom at all and we haven't gotten any dualwield. If we don't kill them in our first hit or the second (against classes that haven't got any instant stuff) we are dead. Its very simple; we gave up all our skill points to do that one thing, kill in one or two hits or die trying. The critblades (as they are called) cant one hit kill a tank and if we try to kill a tank, most of the time we get killed fast ! We paid a price to kill robe wearers in one hit. If you want to take the ability to kill in one hit away from us because of &quot;insane amounts of dam dealing&quot; what are we left with ? Tell me what I am supposed to do on the battle field now that I specced that way ?<br />

Casters/scouts one shot a hell of a lot more people than any assassin class. I have seen casters one shot an equal con caster with a crit. I have seen scouts one shot a blue TANK class before. I have also seen polearm spec armsmen one shot casters. I don't see why any concern should come on our class. They should be giving casters more hit point gear then, because casters with hit gear, I can't one shot, even with a crit. Why are the targets always misguided when it comes to Mythic? Instead of fixing the problems with certain classes, they nerf others capabilities so they can't do their jobs. No, I don't think shadwblades that spec to be one shot killers should be nerfed, that is what they specced for. I just do not understand why one shot kills are any concern of yours, as we ONLY one shot certain people, with properly specced shadowblades being able to do this more efficiently.</div></div><hr />

I have read these boards and Tarnished Blade so as to build a competitive rogue for RvR.  My emotional response to your self-ingratiating, to Mythic?, proposal is to have the envenom nerf only apply to Infiltrators.  They (with their 2.5 points per level) are obviously overpowered from your perspective and this nerf will bring them back in line with the other assassins.  Right?<br />
<br />
I also have 2 low level Infiltrators and a Nightshade and I don't find any of them overpowered or over taxed from all of the requests for grouping they get.

<br />
Here's my template naturally (im an infiltrator):<br />
<br />
50 thrust<br />
50 CS<br />
23 dual wield<br />
16 envenom<br />
41 stealth<br />
<br />
I have no idea how you people think its overpowering for us to kill tanks, but I kill 50 warriors / zerkers / thanes / moosemen heroes / blademasters (without CD too!) all the time.  Am i overpowered?  I think not.  I die in 2 hits from everybody except healer types.  Its all a function of what you build yourself to be.  I built myself to be able to kill anything I land perf/cd (or evade chain) on, but not have the extra aid of envenom incase i mess up.<br />
<br />
There are a few kills i have had that would look overpowered, such as killing a 50 warrior toe to toe (no perf) with dragonfang / 50 CS evade chain, but they are few and far between.  Cant tell you the number of times my CD gets blocked or parried, but its enough to be where if it lands, i should be able to kill the tank (and do).<br />
<br />
Its funny tho how you can perf a SB for 390 with a 2.4 delay weap (one of the best around at the time), and have them hit you back with garrot for 470 (out of low 900's hp) using a 2h weap....  and then they get all touchy and start to complain about how slow it is and stuff like it justifies that or something.<br />
<br />
Think maybe everybody is imbalanced in a way (look at scouts vs hunters), no point in complaining about something you cant fix.  Dont think mythic is ever going to remove 2h, or give sb more skill points or whatever now...<br />
<br />
back on topic though, If you can by some miracle actually do dragonfang in a fight (given that you have end left, you havent preplanned another style, or thier weapon isnt faster than yours), then you will win that fight provided that you didnt CD stun them.  It works nicely when you evade, if you evade and have the calmness to pull it off<br />
<br />
but heed this warning (i have 50 nat. thrust at the expense of envenom):<br />
<br />
DO NOT SPEC TO 50 NATURAL THRUST SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DRAGONFANG.  YOU SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST SEVERAL OTHER STRONG REASONS TO DO SO.<br />
<br />
I personally have 50 thrust because:<br />
<br />
#1.  I want a big CS.  thrust = Weapskill = more damage overall.  <br />
<br />
#2.  I dont solo in rvr.  I fight in big group battles, and often dont bother to restealth after my first perf chain.  the 50 thrust makes me like a low grade merc to some extent.<br />
<br />
#3.  Dragonfang is cool<br />
<br />
#4.  I dont want to be dependant on lifebane (it expensive) to kill people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for answering my question and remembering what this thread was supposed to be about.<br />
<br />
I am a believer that an assassin should be oneshotting people.  That's one form of assassination.  Standing toe-to-toe with someone isn't assassination, it's fighting.  An assassin should be able to assassinate people, not necessarily beat them into the ground.<br />
<br />
If the 50 Thrust ups my CS damage appropriately, it would be worth sacrificing some envenom for.  If not, then I may as well dump those points into envenom, because I'll need that back-up damage if I fail an assassination...which I will often if PA has a huge variance.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for getting back on topic.<br />

<br />
You arent going to be one shotting people (including blue standing casters) unless you crit, but you will be 2-5 shotting most people most of the time. <br />
<br />
Your actual thrust spec has less to do with your damage than you might think.  50 Spec (itemized or not) will give you the low variance, but what they DONT tell you is about weapskill.<br />
<br />
Lets say you cap for like 750 and have 750 Weapskill with 50 itemized thrust.<br />
<br />
You perf for around 350-450 damage.  only 25ish % variance (25% of 400 is 100 so im giving you a little bit there in your favor).<br />
<br />
Now lets say you get buffed to 1100 Weapskill<br />
<br />
You now perf for 600-750.  Still low variance, but higher overall damage.<br />
<br />
So more thrust = more weap = more damage.  You can (to a certain degree) pad the effect of lower thrust with max str / dex.  You can also make max spec much better with max str / dex and tons of thrust gear.  Unbuffed at 50 i have 946 using a player made rapier.  980ish using ellyll rapier, and gawd knows what it will be when i turn in my seals for that +5 thrust rapier.  I hit pretty hard too, cap at 711 (i dumped 3 CS for 2 thrust on my gem), and usually hit for 500-711.  I cap like 90% of the time if im buffed.<br />
<br />
I still dont one shot a lot of people though.  I rvr in groups and take down tanks or healers a lot.  Envenom will make you more well rounded i think, but its up to you....   Spec 50 thrust and 50 CS (sacrificing envenom) and you are going to end up beating people up most of the time(blademasters are my favorite people to pick on).</div></div><hr />

Still 2 thrust points away from my cap too, so could maybe get around 1015 - 1025 unbuffed weap...<br />
