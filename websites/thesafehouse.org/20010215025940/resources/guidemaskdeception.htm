        - For a good map and guide check out the Relentless Monks website at </font><a href="http://monks.volitionx.com/"><font
        color="#FFFFFF">monks.volitionx.com</font></a><font
        color="#FFFFFF">, the lower guk guide is specifically at </font><a
        href="http://monks.volitionx.com/lowerguk.htm"><font
        color="#FFFFFF">http://monks.volitionx.com/lowerguk.htm</font></a><font
        color="#FFFFFF">. I suggest you get these maps, print them out and follow 
        the guide through with them, marking your path so you can easily find 
        your way. The maps look pretty good even when printed in Black and White 
        (Greyscale). The spawn you are looking for is 'a ghoul assassin' that 
        spawns in the Supply Room, also called the ass/supp spawn, on the maps 
        the area is marked as '19'. The mask you are looking for is his common 
        drop, the Serrated Bone Dirk (8dmg/27dly Pierce, Effect:Engulfing Darkness(Snare/DOT), 
        Rog Only) is his rare. He has place holders, so it can take a while to 
        spawn. Before going you should maybe put all your stuff in the bank, if 
        you die down here you may not get your body back. At anywhere less then 
        25 be very careful as if you are trained you have very little chance of 
        making it out alive. If you have any questions don't be afraid to ask.

      <p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><em><strong>PART I </strong></em><strong>- 
        Getting to Lower Guk Dead Side</strong></font><font
        color="#0000FF"><strong> </strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">You should enter lower guk by the dead side entrance, 
        this can be found if you follow the right wall all the way from the innothule 
        zone to a lower guk zone. This is generally right as there are a few spots 
        you can skip and will want to. The only thing on the way you should run 
        into that can see through your hide/sneak is the large and giant heart 
        spiders. These are rare spawns and while going thru the spider rooms (you 
        will know them when you see them) you can stick to the left wall to aviod 
        them (even thou these spawns are likely camped or dead) Normal heart spiders 
        can be snuck upon. After the spider room stick back to the right wall 
        you will enter the scryre room, just stay on the lower level and take 
        an exit behind the left water pillar, head down the ramp here and you 
        will enter a room with stone walls and pillars, head to straight away 
        from the ramp to the second section and along it to the left (you can 
        continue to follow the right wall but you will hit a secret wall, just 
        follow this secret wall as thou it were solid) Continue allong the right 
        wall, you will pass a turn off to the left, keep going straight, you will 
        slide down a slippery section, and at the end it will open into high bluffs 
        over a watery area, carefully go over this area following the right edge. 
        Continue following the right wall until you turn into a hall off from 
        the main one you were just following, there should be a stone just before 
        the turn and a flaming pot in the hall, this flaming pot is just opposite 
        the dead side zone to lower guk. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Preparations in Lower Guk</strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
        - When you get into lower guk ask immediately if the bedroom is camped 
        as well as the assassin spawn, if the bedroom isn't you might have to 
        go out and get a SoW, or get an invis to undead before proceeding. The 
        reason is that you will run into some water and unless you swim fast you 
        won't make it under the water sneaking (I am unsure what swimming skill 
        you need to do it with sneak on and without it on). Ok, now be careful, 
        invis to undead(itu) and sneak/hide <u>do not</u> stack and there are 
        both undead and living things near the zone. More often then not they 
        will be cleared out. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Getting to the Bed Room (BR)</strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
        - Now proceed down the dead side ramp and when you come to the end turn 
        to your right, proceed down another ramp (if you go left it will be a 
        slippery ramp and you will want to go back) You will turn a gentle corner 
        and come to a river, swim under it and head to the right, you will agian 
        turn a gentle corner then a sharp corner (this will be a 180 degree turn) 
        before you come up, to the left will be the area called the Bed Room(BR), 
        if it isn't camped or cleared there will be ghouls here, so don't jump 
        out of the water unless you have a way by them (itu or sneak/hide). </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Going through the BR, Spider Room, 
        and getting by the GIBs</strong></font><font
        color="#FFFFFF"> - Once in the room there will be two halls leading over 
        the underwater passage you just came though. It is best to hide here but 
        if you try while ghouls are in the room and only have itu you will become 
        visible. Once you are hidden (or if you wanna try going with itu) go thru 
        the left hall, that is the one nearest the water. At the end of this hall 
        is the spider/bat room. The spiders and bats can't see thru my invis but 
        it is unknown to me if it is level based, if you hug the left wall and 
        move quick thou they won't see you. Now you are in another hall, head 
        down it aways and once you start turning hug the right wall. To your left 
        you will see a room full of about 5 greater ice boned skeletons. Hugging 
        the right wall they won't see you but they don't see my sneak/hide. Just 
        move quick. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>The Bridge and Dead Tower</strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
        - Now you will come to a left turn that will mount some stairs and open 
        into a bridge with a large tower in front of you, to your right are gargoyles, 
        they see everything but magic invis. On the other side of the chasm to 
        the left is a ledge where the ghoul ritualist spawns, head straight across 
        this area (careful not to fall, i would not suggest drinking before starting 
        this endevor) and into that tower you see (this should not be confused 
        with the live tower and it is more commonly refered to as the bridge area 
        or dead tower) Once you enter the tower head through it into a room behind 
        it and turn left, follow a hall way straight to a ladder, this ladder 
        leads into the Store Room (SR, somtimes called the ass(assin), supp(lier) 
        or ass/supp) </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Inside the Store Room (SR,ass/supp)</strong></font><font
        color="#FFFFFF"> - This is where the ghoul assassin spawns along with 
        the ghoul supplier. Now be very careful, if there isn't a group at the 
        camp because the assassin can see thru rogue hide (although sneak will 
        work on him as long as you are behind him of course). Now ask the group 
        there if you can loot the next Mask of Deception, If there is already 
        someone in the group or one that got there before you waiting then graciously 
        allow them the first loot and they will allow you a subsequent mask loot. 
        At this point you have two options, you can wait until you mask drops 
        or you can ask a member of the group there if they will tell your alternate 
        when one drops and you can go play him until the call, with the latter 
        way thou you may get in trouble if the group evac's, leaves or you take 
        to long and someone else gets the mask. It can take several hours for 
        the assassin to spawn and drop a mask, so patience is a virtue here. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Getting Out </strong></font><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><strong>- </strong></font><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Getting</font><font
        color="#FFFFFF"> out can be just as dangerous as getting in, if someone 
        in the group at the ass spawn is nice they might evac you to SRo or NRo/WC 
        but don't think they have to. If not you will have to reverse the aformentioned 
        process and go back the same way you came. If you are leaving via the 
        dead side you can take the water exit, but if your swimming is bad it 
        will be a long and hard swim, at least you will get practice. I am not 
        going to detail this way as it is longer and generally striaght forward. 
        If you look at the maps you should figure it out. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong><i>PART II </i></strong><strong>- 
        Getting to Lower Guk Live Side </strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This part is only really effective if you are non-KoS 
        to frogs, If you are KoS I suggest you do the dead side method instead 
        as this is basically just a little safer and slightly faster to duplicate. 
        Follow the same directions as in Part I, Step 2 to get to the lower guk 
        dead side zone, but instead of taking the side hall to dead zone continue 
        straight down the hall Into a room, take the other exit out of this room 
        and take your <u>second</u> right, you will turn into a resevior area, 
        take the wood bridge and then take the next plank directly right of you. 
        Follow the right wall until you come to a large open area. Now follow 
        the shore line to the wall and follow the wall to another plank room, 
        take the double plank across and then take your left this time. This will 
        lead to the live side zone. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Getting to the Patriarch Spawn</strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
        - Note that if you are KoS by living frogloks then </font><font
        color="#FF0000">STOP</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> right now and go back 
        to the dead side zone and go that method, this ways is <u>only</u> safe 
        of you are non-KoS. I can't stress this enough. The patriarch is one of 
        the mobs in live side that sees invisible, and if you are taking this 
        route you won't need to sneak, just start running on in, the only thing 
        that would be trained that might attack you is the evil eye, anything 
        else would go to the dead side zone or the king's back door zone. Now 
        head straight down the ramp, straight down the hall, across a bridge and 
        follow the hall straight (stick to the right side, you will hit a false 
        wall but it has a solid wall right behind it). Now you will pass one turnoff 
        to the left, then will make a sharp left turn into room with three exits, 
        This is where the minotuar patriarch spawns, he casts see invis and wanders. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Getting to the Elder Spawn </strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF">- 
        Continue to follow the right wall out the right exit of the three way 
        exit room. You very shortly come to another intersenction, one path goes 
        left, one right and another does a U-turn back on the other side of a 
        wall. Take the <u>left</u>. Once you have taken the left follow the right 
        wall again past two left turns and follow it through another for exit 
        room, you will take a dip under upper cave that you can see a bit of through 
        a crack and after that take your first left. Once you take the left take 
        a right and follow the hall past a right turn and into a room, this room 
        has a pit over on the other side of it where the minotuar elder spawns, 
        it also cast's see invis. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Getting to the Bridge</strong></font><font color="#0000FF"> 
        </font><font
        color="#FFFFFF">- Follow the right wall though this room and stop before 
        going down the hall, now read this first until i tell you to continue. 
        There is a pit trap down this hall, if you are to young to have safe fall 
        it might do you some nasty damage as well as annoy you. If you are KoS 
        and haven't yet been seen and you fall down this you might die here, you 
        won't be able to make it up the ladder with sneak on, it has to be removed. 
        Now to see this pit trap look for a red mark on the left wall, this mark 
        indicates where the hole is, take a run at it and jump, you should make 
        it easily, if not climb up the pit into the room behind you and try, try 
        again. Ok continue down the hall, through a small room and to the left 
        up some ramps to a ladder, climb the ladder into a small round room. Now 
        just outside this room is where it gets deadly, there are gargoyles out 
        there and they won't like you regardless of faction, race, or religion. 
        They are living and see invis to undead and they also see hide/sneak, 
        I think thou that regular invis will get you by them. Otherwise you will 
        have to call on someone to pull the gargoyles (many like to since they 
        aren't to tough and drop eyes that sell for 9pp). </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>The Bridge and Dead Tower</strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
        - Once they are pulled put on sneak/hide and head out, go to the right 
        and you will come to the bridge/undead tower, From here on out you can 
        follow the dead side directions from the same number, just be aware you 
        are entering the tower from a different way and will have to turn to your 
        right on the bridge. It should be easy to understand when you get there. 
        </font></p>
