Hear Ye Hear Ye!!<br />
I have an announcement from the Safehouse Staff.<br />
If I can have all of your attentions, I will proceed.<br />
<br />
*Clears throat*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  The Safehouse NWN game Sever<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
<br />
The Safehouse staff, in an attempt to continue its support of the MMORPG and Rogue communities will be providing a Neverwinter Nights gaming environment. We will be providing a general, persistent module that will represent a virtual Safehouse as well as weekly/monthly adventure party Modules. All attempts are being made to provide an enjoyable gaming experience in a fashion you have become accustom to from the Safehouse.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
All access to the Safehouse NWN game servers will be granted to the individual by providing the individual with a server password.<br />
<br />
Anyone wishing to participate on the servers must sign up for an account through the Safehouse NWN web server. By requiring this, we can keep tabs on those we have given access to, and keep everyone informed of updates through email and Web site posts.<br />
<br />
We will only be allowing server vaulted characters. This means that you must create, and level up your character on the Safehouse Neverwinter Nights server. We will provide enough content to allow you to both advance your characters as well as have fun doing so. We wish to stress that this environment is being designed for fun. If you wish to grief other players, do not even bother applying.<br />
<br />
The Server is not a public server. Access is granted as a privilege. If you are found to have given out the access information without permission you risk losing your access along with those you gave the information to. Please respect this rule.<br />
<br />
We will be providing a method of Module submission to allow Safehouse members to create and DM their own modules. The details for how this will work are still being ironed out, but there will be a review process. We do this as to guarantee a quality experience for all those participating.<br />
<br />
There will be a calendar with scheduled events, and sign up sheets for each. As each encounter is specifically designed for a certain number of people, we must provide restrictions for events. Based on the popularity of individual modules, we will allow extended running to allow all members to participate.<br />
<br />
A detailed rules and regulations list will be posted on the Website once it has gone live, for your viewing pleasure.<br />
<br />
As we near the opening of the Safehouse NWN Web and Game servers, we look forward to seeing you all there with anticipation.<br />
<br />
The Safehouse Staff<br />

<br />
<br />
Things Im curious to see if are possible (feel free to answer anyone)<br />
<br />
1.  Playing of dice or cards, or other games of chance.<br />
2.  Dart/Throwing Knife Board (I think it may be, since I know you have a target in the beginning of the solo game)<br />
3.  Admin instigated non lethal fisticuff combat (I.E. a bar brawl).<br />
4.  Pickpocketing/Other roguely skill training rooms.  Maybe with marked lvls of difficulty and simulated penalties for failing.<br />
5.  Floor pit traps.  For the areas you shouldnt be, but cant help yourself.<br />
<br />
I think this has the potential to be very, very exciting.  <br />

I have a family member who has spoken about creating a persistent world, such as you are doing with this Safehouse module.  If you are interested, I could have him speak with you to possibly share some ideas amongst yourselves.<br />

<br />
If I was to make a module called, lets just say for arguments sake, The Druids Grove and made a zone to adhere to your world (a forest that has a portal to the actual grove) how would that work?  Would you take me designs in or just do a complete &quot;jump&quot; to my module on my servers?  So I would be submitting atleast two zones for you.<br />
<br />
I was planning on doing my own complete module but then I realized thats too much work.  I would however like to have persistent content up to help further the NWN Community.<br />
<br />
Wait, a third question...would other persistent worlds be able to &quot;jump&quot; to my module (zones) in addition to the SH if allowed? The Napping Druid<br />

What I meant was that we'd probably find a good way to link your zone to our module, I wasn't implying that we'd host it by completely including it into our module.

I've been knee-deep in NWN past three weeks... what is EQ?  Thank freaking god... EQ's end-game uber-take-a-boss-number mentality was killing me.  I've worked hard for almost a year in my guild on Tarew Marr and concluded that there just is not enough room for four, five, six end-game guilds on that server.  It drove me me crazy not being able to take the guild forward because the power-gamer guilds have to kill AL or AoW or whatever mob for the 6th-gzillion time and then I read on their web-sites and see their whining about how crappy the drops were.  Absolutely sickening!!!  NWN gives us the power to push that @#%$ right out the window... goodbye power-game butt-munchkins!<br />
<br />
And some may say how bad NW is... well I'll tell ya what... NWN is &quot;sketchy&quot; at the moment, especially scripting and model building aspects, but that will all change as time moves on.  Trust me... this game only limitations is the ambitiousness of its module and content designers.<br />
<br />

I just got Neverwinter Nights a few days ago, being absent from rpg's since I took my leave from EQ(how's Nasbin been anyway?) and I really enjoyed the single player, reliving my gnome rogue self. Online was a big dissapointment, with these &quot;custom items&quot; and lvl 20 characters running amuck, it just wasnt any fun - I've been looking for a nice community of players with a private server to join up with. My question: Will I be allowed to join this server in the fun? I really like the prospect of server side only characters, everyone starting off on an equal footing again, and I hope I can join in. Thanks for consideration.</div></div><hr />

I like making custom items for my assassin geared towards nigh-unkillable people on full pvp servers. Most of them dont use ranged, so I set up a &quot;Gauntlet O Traps&quot; and fire away at them till they chase me through them. Course, if its a server where you can respawn in the same place instantly its moot.</div></div><hr />

If you did you need to use a direct Connect option fomr multiplayer.<br />

I've tried LAN connect, I've tried internet connect, I've tried putting :7777 on end of server name, I've tried without :7777.  I ALWAYS get server not available.<br />
I know there have been some times when it has been down, but I'm assuming if I can get to the web site, then its up. <br />

<br />
Edit: well, for every denial rule I have, I turned logs on so I could see which one was being hit.  I got nothing in the logs file.  So now I'm stumped.  I'm not going to turn off my firewall so I can play multiplayer NWN.<br />
<br />
PS.  Its not just Safehouse server thats being affected, I can't connect to any servers in NWN.  Any ideas from the firewall people?  I'm using Personal Tiny Firewall.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">07-29-02, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Default port for connecting is 5120..<br />
<br />
of course the Safehouse is on a different port..<br />
<br />
The problem is the first port is used to connect, but there are an additional 200 that could be used..<br />
<br />
So open UDP ports from 5120 to 5320 for regular, and open the Safehouse ports from the port you use for connecting + 200 more..<br />
<br />
Make sure you are opening UDP and not TCP..</div></div><hr />

Some modules are set up so when you hit 0 hp, you count down to -10 hp and then you're dead.  Since nearly everyone is a rogue, no one can rez the dead, so it'd make more sense to have the -10 hp=death rule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been waiting for the server to come up for ages (in between finishing the gmae and starting my own module )<br />
<br />
But I'm now having a small problem. I can connect to the server fine, I can create a character (Malvan Klaive, naturally), but when I've finished and hit 'play' I get an error saying that login has been refused due to the character being illegal. He's only a 1st level rogue, what could possibly be wrong with him?<br />
<br />
Malvan Klaive.</div></div><hr />
