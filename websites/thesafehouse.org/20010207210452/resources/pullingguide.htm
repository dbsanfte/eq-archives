      <p><b>1. BEFORE PULLING THE FIRST TIME </b></p>
      <p><b>a.) Learn the area</b> Get yourself some maps (<i>IMHO the best maps 
        can be found here: http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/index2e.html</i>), 
        study them and compare them to the actual dungeon by walking through the 
        dungeon using hide&amp;sneak. Maps are nice, but nothing can make up for 
        your 1st-hand knowledge of each turn and twist of a dungeon. You have 
        to know the dungeon. During the pull, you don&#146;t have the time to 
        look at the map figuring out the way back to the camp of your group. Especially 
        in high-level dungeons like Lower Guk every second can be critical. So 
        take your time, and take a good luck at the dungeon. It can save you when 
        running from trains, and it often allows you to join groups more easily, 
        as they don&#146;t have to send someone to get you from zone if you know 
        the way yourself. Also find and learn any trapdoors and illusionary walls 
        the dungeon may have. This is also a good way to do the next thing, that 
        is... </p>
      <p><b>b.) Learn the mobs</b> The most important thing. There are several 
        things you ought to know about the mobs you pull: <font color="#0000FF"><i><br>
        Level:</i></font> To get the basic info on the mob use /con or &quot;c&quot;-key 
        or get the knowledge from other players. This should be easy. <font color="#0000FF"><i><br>
        How hard they hit:</i></font> /con-ing them is nice, but doesn&#146;t 
        always give correct answers, e.g. &quot;bloodthirsty ghouls&quot; and 
        named spawns hit MUCH harder than their /con would make you believe they 
        do, another example for this is Dvinn in Crushbone. <font color="#0000FF"><i><br>
        Caster or non-caster:</i></font> Usually you can tell this from their 
        name, but not always; also many mobs can &quot;cast&quot; or use spell-like 
        abilities even when they are fighters. Best example are the undead froglok 
        ghouls in Lower Guk: they can root you, which can be lethal if you are 
        too far from your group to help you or to heal you. In such cases, be 
        quick to give your group a tell where you are so that they can come to 
        your help (Try to be VERY exact, no time for long speeches when a kor 
        wizzy is nuking you). Also, high magic resistance is essential [see 2a. 
        Prepare yourself]. <br>
        <font color="#0000FF"><i>Pet or no pet:</i></font> this being very important, 
        for a stuck pet can cause awful trains, so you should know whether a mob 
        has a pet or not. (&quot;Uh, shouldn&#146;t he have a pet?&quot;- Famous 
        last words). <br>
        <font color="#0000FF"><i>Pathing:</i></font> What way will the mobs take 
        to follow me? Is it possible that he will aggro other mobs on that way, 
        too? Also, what way will he use to run away? <font color="#0000FF"><i><br>
        Aggro range:</i></font> How close can I get to the mob before he will 
        aggro on me? How long can I stay near him till he will attack me? Sometimes 
        you can pass mobs that /con threatenly, but I wouldn&#146;t bet on it. 
        The fact if he aggros on you at all is also important. Some mobs won&#146;t 
        aggro on you at all, once they are &quot;green&quot; enough. Others will 
        always attack you, even when you are lev 50 (skeletons are a nice example 
        for this, even at lev 40 I am still attacked by them) <font color="#0000FF"><i><br>
        Aggro behavior:</i></font> Will he stay aggro&#146;d on me, even when 
        I run past other players? There are a lot of mobs that will attack the 
        nearest player, not necessary the one that originally attacked it (e.g. 
        skeletons, reanimated hand, vampiric bats, gargoyles(?), and others). 
        These can be very hard, if not impossible to pull past other groups. And 
        other groups normally won&#146;t be very happy if you train them with 
        mobs. </p>
      <p><b>c.) Learn the spawns</b> The small difference between success and 
        failure. Know where the mobs spawn, how many spawn, how often they spawn 
        and what mobs spawn at a given point. This enables you to check the spawn 
        points efficiently and fast, while others just run around and hope to 
        find a mob. You should also know what mobs could possibly spawn between 
        the place where you pull from and the point where your group is camping. 
      </p>
      <p><b>d.) Know your group</b> Also a very important point. Knowing what 
        each character in your group can do is essential, too. Having healers 
        allows you to pull harder mobs. Having crowd-control allows you to pull 
        multiple targets. Having mana-makers and healers also allows you to pull 
        faster, so less break between the pulls. Know who will be the main tank. 
        All should assist the main tank, so that enchanters, bards and necros 
        can mez/charm surplus mobs. </p>
      <p><b>2. BEFORE THE PULL </b></p>
      <p><b>a.) Prepare yourself</b> Before pulling, check your buffs. You should 
        have all the buffs your party can provide. Most useful are the following: 
        HP, AC buffs, resistances (magic, fire, cold), STR/DEX Buffs, STA buffs 
        (for the long runs&amp;jumps to be faster) and maybe even symbols, runes 
        and the like. SoW is essential when fighting in &quot;outdoor&quot; dungeons 
        like Cazic-Thule, Blackburrow, Crushbone, Mistmoore and Unrest, but can't 
        be cast in &quot;indoor&quot; dungeons like Upper/Lower Guk, Splitpaw, 
        Sol A/B, Permafrost, or Kedge Keep. If you can have it cast on you while 
        still outside the indoor dungeons, by all means do so! Also check your 
        health. You should be full health, for it is very likely that you will 
        loose 1-2 bub of HP during the pull (at least that can happen fairly regulary 
        in L Guk) </p>
      <p><b>b.) Prepare the group</b> Also, before pulling check the situation 
        of your group. Ask for a mana report. Let the others tell you if they 
        are ready. Wait for their &quot;okay&quot;. Nothing is more annoying than 
        a puller that says &quot;Pulling!&quot;, runs off and comes back with 
        4 red mobs to hear the cleric say &quot;LOM&quot; and the enchanter &quot;OOM&quot;. 
        In groups lev 30+ the pace you pull at it usually dictated by the mana 
        of your casters (and sadly, by the number of mobs availible). </p>
      <p><b>c.) On assisting</b> This is one, if not THE most important command 
        to use in group fighting. There are several ways to use this: 1.) type 
        /assist while having a group member targeted will switch your target to 
        same target your group member has. This is the normal way to use /assist 
        in fights with several mobs. 2.) type /assist while having a mob targeted 
        will switch your target to the player that mob is attacking, usefull for 
        healers to see who is smashed to pieces and needs a heal. 3.) type /assist 
        xxxxx, where xxxxx is the name of a player. This will result with you 
        having the same target as that player, no matter what you had targeted 
        before. This is the best option if you have a designated person to be 
        assisted in all fights. Normally I have a hotkey with the command /assist 
        (tank's name) on my combat page of hotkeys. <b>MASTERING ASSISTING IS 
        (IMHO) THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF SUCCESSFUL FIGHTING IN MULTI-MOB-ENVIRONMENTS!</b> 
        Sorry for the shout, but had to emphasise my point. :) </p>
      <p><b>3. THE PULL </b></p>
      <p><b>a.) Look for possible targets</b> After you have prepared yourself 
        and your group for the pull, go and look for possible targets. Use your 
        (hopefully) superior knowledge of the area, the mobs and the pathing of 
        the mobs to be more succesful than other pullers. </p>
      <p><b>b.) Inform group</b> Once you have found one or multiple targets, 
        you should inform your group of the pull. This can be a simple &quot;INC!&quot; 
        or a multi-line hotkey or any other sentence that clearly indicates that 
        mobs are incoming. If in doubt if your group can the the mobs you are 
        likely to pull, just ask them: &quot;Uh, ready for 2 blue wans and 1 yellow 
        zol?&quot;. If you succeed at informing your group exactly what you are 
        going to pull and are right about it, it usually earns you a lot of respect 
        in the group. </p>
      <p><b>c.) Pull</b> Once your group is informed, pull the mobs using one 
        of these methods: - use a bow, or even throwing weapons - run past them, 
        thus aggo&#146;ing them - run up to them, and attack them Using a ranged 
        attack is preferred, as you have a much greater chance of not pulling 
        unwanted mobs. With one or several mobs aggo&#146;ed on you, you should 
        head back as fast as possible to your group. Feel free to use shortcuts 
        like dropping from bridges, and also jump to get a little more distance 
        between you and the mobs. If you manage/like you can also give your group 
        another warning that mobs are &quot;INC!!!&quot;. When pulling multiple 
        mobs, make sure to target the most dangerous mob first, so that those 
        who are /assist-ing will all converge on the proper target. The list of 
        danger is in this order: 1.) Healers - #1 priority! Otherwise they will 
        sit there and heal whatever you are fighting. 2.) Enchanters - When half 
        your group gets charmed you are in some serious trouble. 3.) All other 
        caster types (wizzies, mages, necros). 4.) Tanking mobs 5.) Caster pets 
        Also don't attack a green creature to start a pull, hitting a green will 
        pull both the green and the blue, hitting the blue will not always pull 
        the green. </p>
      <p><b>d.) Special notes on pulling caster mobs</b> Prepare your group for 
        a caster pull. Tell them to get ready to heal you the second you are in 
        range. This is very important for pulling wizzy ghouls in L Guk, for example. 
        Another thing you may want to try (where possible) is to run past the 
        group or around another corner near the group so that he cannot stop 20 
        feet from your group and start nuking you. By running past your group 
        for another 20 feet, you force him to stay into range, following you and 
        thus running right into your waiting group. Another way to &quot;encourage&quot; 
        the mob to melee is to sit down, which will cause him to come and attack 
        you, too. But be warned, you will take maximum melee damage if the mob 
        hits you while sitting. If pulling multiple casters, have someone who 
        can stun keep one of them busy until the group can focus on it. </p>
      <p><b>e.) What to do in case of a bad pull</b> Lets label it knowing when 
        you seriously messed up. You pull too many MoBs that are way to high for 
        your level party to handle. What to do? Well you got some options: <i><br>
        </i><font color="#0000FF"><i>Kill yourself: </i></font>Let your party 
        know to STAY put and not help you. Finda good place to recover your corpse 
        and just let the MoBs kill you and at least your party is safe. And if 
        you have a Cleric with Res in the party at least it won't take you too 
        long to get your body back. <i><br>
        </i><font color="#0000FF"><i>Take Your Pull to the Zone: </i></font>Try 
        and make it to the zone. Just remember to warn the zone you are coming 
        *wink*. Save your party and yourself. <i><br>
        </i><font color="#0000FF"><i>Bring the Pull to the Party but Warn them 
        it may be Hopeless:</i></font> Tell your evacers to be sure they got Evac 
        Ready cause they might need it. You might kill everything and be ok, but 
        then you may need to evac. If you don't have evac, be sure everyone knows 
        they maybe running for the zone or gating. Basically Keep an eye on your 
        pull after you pulled it. Did you run past somthing on your way that will 
        join your pull that wasn't there before? Did you run into a Huge train 
        on the way back that might come with you? Etc. </p>
      <p><b>4. Other Notes</b> </p>
      <p>Always have the highest level tank pull if possible. The higher the level 
        difference between the puller and the target, the smaller the aggro radius 
        of the puller. </p>
      <p>The /assist command only works if the target has autoattack on. Make 
        sure to turn it on while running back after pulling. When pulling a mob 
        if you just run past it to aggro it and you run past another group that 
        is fighting, it WILL leave you and join in the other groups fight usually 
        causing much anger...You have to make sure you damage the mob. Just throwing 
        that dagger or shooting the arrow isnt enough if you want to keep the 
        mob on you back to your group, you have to cause damage - the more the 
        better. This applies to multiple mob pulls as well. If you just damage 
        one and another was in aggro range and you pull past another group fighting... 
        yes, you guessed it, the second (undamaged mob) will join the fight already 
        in progress again causing much anger and shouting. </p>
      <p>Also another lesson learned the hard way (i.e. much anger and shouting) 
        is if you pull past a group that is fighting and they cast an AE spell 
        of anykind (my example was a warrior using painbringer) and the AE spell 
        outdamages your initial pulling damage you WILL lose the mob to that other 
        group. In the way overcrowded dungeons being considerate and using pulling 
        etiquette can make or break your reputation. Just remember the person 
        you snaked that pull from today might be in the group with the openning 
        for you tomorrow. Do you see a particularly dangerous pull? Coordinate 
        with a nearby group to help and everyone can benefit. For example ask 
        another group to break the GIBs in LGuk that were spawned (full spawn 
        of 4). Each group kills two, and both groups are happy about it because 
        it made pulling all told much nicer. </p>
