<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT:0px" align=left><em>As we have said many times, we do take action against those who break the Terms of Service. While we may not be very vocal about it most of the time, that doesn't mean that we are sitting idly by while players break the rules. We have banned thousands of accounts since release and will continue to do so as necessary. Just because we haven't removed specific characters that you feel are breaking the rules doesn't mean that we won't, it just means that banning an account isn't something we take lightly. We must ensure that a user deserves to be banned before we do so, and proving that takes time.</em></p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT:0px" align=left><em>We've recently commented on a group of players from the Everfrost server that were removed if you are interested: <br><br>Gallenite <br><br></em><a href="http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=111&amp;message.id=3227#M3227" target=_blank><em>http://eqiiforums.station.son y.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=111&amp;message.id=3227#M3227</em></a><em> <br>Thank you for reporting these, both in game and here. <br><br>Unattended play violates the EULA. It is included in the EULA because it removes opportunities from those who play by the rules. Quite simply, it will not be tolerated. <br><br>We do not give details on specific actions taken against specific accounts. Rest assured that the situation is being dealt with in a permanent fashion. <br><br><br>Blackguard <br><br></em><a href="http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=111&amp;message.id=3283#M3283" target=_blank><em>http://eqiiforums.station.so ny.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=111&amp;message.id=3283#M3283</em></a><em> <br>Here is some further information for those interested: We investigated the harassment and exploitation reports that we received. Harassment, training, and unattended play are not tolerated in EverQuest II, and we do take action. A handful of individuals were discovered to be breaking the Terms of Service, and we found that these few individuals owned dozens of accounts. All of these accounts have been banned permanently and their characters have been removed. What this means is that you will not only no longer have to deal with the undesirable behavior, but they will also no longer appear on EQ2Players.com (this may take a little while to occur). <br><br></em><a href="http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=111&amp;message.id=3327#M3327" target=_blank><em>http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/mes sage?board.id=111&amp;message.id=3327#M3327</em></a><em> <br>One more update for you folks who are interested. A whole pile of platinum was also removed from the economy. One account in this ring of now-banned accounts covered 6 of the top 8 richest players in the game world. The top 2 accounts are now suspended and are under investigation. <br><br>While we may not always keep you updated on what is going on behind-the-scenes as far as ToS-breaking goes, we have been performing similar sweeps since release and will continue to take action as time goes on. Simply put, we don't want money from cheaters. If you are found to be breaking the Terms of Service, your account will be removed. <br><br>Ryan "Blackguard" Shwayder</em> </p></blockquote>
