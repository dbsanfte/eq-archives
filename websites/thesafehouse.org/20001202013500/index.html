<strong><font color="#ff0000">Patch message - Wed Nov 29th</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, November 29, 2000 by <a href="mailto:zato@thesafehouse.org">Zato</a></small><br><blockquote>November 29th, 3:00am <br>------------------------------ <br><br>*Patch Day* <br><br>Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues: <br><br>- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum. Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction. <br><br>- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC. The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters. As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type. For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything. <br><br>- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes. For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue. <br><br>- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards. Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it. <br><br>- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in. <br><br>- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled. Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted. <br><br>- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace". This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game. <br><br>- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances. There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future. <br><br>- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while. <br><br>- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons. The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability. It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <br><br>- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant. Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune. <br><br>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill. <br><br>Remember! Only a few days left until the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious. Reserve your copy at your local retailer today! <br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Patch for November 21, 2000</font> </strong><small>Posted Tuesday, November 21, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>November 21st, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last week's big patch. The following changes were made:<br><br>- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or below the minimum.<br>- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified whenever the volume slider was moved.<br>- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association with mipmapping.<br>- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the wrong slot.<br>- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those carried by dwarves. <br>- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of experience in slight disagreement with the server.<br>- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that would do around one million points of damage if left to its own devices.<br>- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable. <br><br>In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following the patch today. Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune. We would have named the new server under its full name if not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing "Bristlebane" server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team </blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Patch message for November 16, 2000</font> </strong><small>Posted Thursday, November 16, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>November 16th, 8:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Follow-up Patch*<br><br>Today's follow-up patch addresses the following issues from yesterday's patch:<br><br>- The spell Torpor received an unintentional reduction in effectiveness<br>- Illumination in game was not as bright as it should have been. <br>- Pet using classes unintentionally gained the ability to summon multiple pets.<br>- Bard songs were reacting poorly with invisibility/hide/sneak.<br>- Hitpoints were being reported incorrectly to clients.<br>- Changing resolutions would cause some to crash.<br><br>In addition, the following changes were left out of yesterday's patch message:<br><br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some to not be able to cast after being feared. <br>- Data for group members and targets will be updated more frequently. This change should reduce complaints of warping and slow hitpoint and other updates.<br>- Bards received increases in the skill cap for their instrument skills.<br>- Changed the default combo for casting spells from CTRL-1:8 to ALT-1:8, as CTRL was interfering with players ability to strafe.<br><br>Thank you for your continued patience.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team </blockquote><hr>
