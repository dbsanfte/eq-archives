<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Furina Goldfinger</div><div class="date">08-28-01, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you wanna raise your skill in poison, but dont have thousands of plat to do it with, and also dont have the time to spend days farming greenies for a few skill points.  Here is a small guide for you so you dont have to search through the poison pages to figure it out (I know, it hurts your widdle head when you think too long)<br />
<br />
First off, throw a couple of skill points into Make and apply for @#%$ ang giggles.  Not a lot, just enough to give you something to work with.  2 or 3 will suffice.  <br />
<br />
Now to get started<br />
Go to WK and visit Gildin Toxfodder(n3000, n13400), bring about 1k if you really wanna grind for awhile.<br />
Start with making Athropic Sap<br />
Lined vial<br />
Constrict suspension<br />
2x Alocassia root<br />
<br />
This will take you to about 98 skill, and once your bags are all full, just continuously apply them to your dagger, you dont actually have to attack and have the poison go off before you can apply a new one, just lay those poisons on thick.  this becomes trivial for apply at 106skill.<br />
<br />
Once you have become trivial with gildin, head on over Steamfont and talk to Ennixy Frennor (p1300 n830) (remember to sneak behind the vendors when buying any poison ingredient to get a better price, it adds up when buying mass quantities)  Buy as many stacks of Kings thorn as you can carry or afford, and then head on over to dagnors cauldron.<br />
<br />
Speak to Cronium Darkblade, he is at the top of the middle island at n230, n830.  Yet sometimes he is moved around, not sure why, so if hes not on top of the island, he hasnt been killed, just moved, so check the base of the island.<br />
<br />
Here you will make Calcium Rot<br />
Sealed Vial<br />
constrict suspension<br />
2x Kings thorn<br />
<br />
This will take you to 172 skill, and you if you apply all these poisons instead of selling them back to the vendor, your apply skill should be between 130-150<br />
<br />
This last part can be done at any vendor that sells vials and suspensions, but cronium was my favorite for a few reasons.  A)  Unrest is right next door, wich is great for farming zombie skins for sealed vials(the most expensive part of poison making if you buy em)<br />
B)  Lots of poison ingredients drop here that can get you from 172 to 200 once you have become trivial with calcium rot<br />
When farming in unrest for vial skins, also save <br />
grave mold<br />
darkbone marrow<br />
aminata phalloide<br />
<br />
Once you have hit 172 skill, if you have 28 skill points that you are willining to burn, I say do it now, the cost you will spend on the skill points isnt much more than the cost you will spend to make the poisons to get to 200, from 180+  you need to make about 30-40 poisons for each skill raise, sometimes more.<br />
<br />
If you dont have those skill points to burn, make these 2 poisons form the items you got in unrest during all your farming there<br />
Visceral rot:<br />
sealed vial<br />
larent suspension<br />
Grave mold<br />
Darkbone marrow<br />
wood rose (from the vendor in Steamfont, same one as kings thorn)<br />
<br />
Essence of Rallos:<br />
sealed vial<br />
Larent suspension<br />
2x amanita phalloide<br />
Pixie dust (of pixies at pixie tower in Lfay, watch out for the brownies)<br />
<br />
If you have tons of money to burn, and never farmed unrest for vial skins, and other components, then its time to head to FV for the last guy you will be dealing with in your Poison training.<br />
Brak daggermist in the rogue guild n3600 p2300<br />
Spirit of Sloth:<br />
Sealed vial<br />
Ethereal suspension<br />
2x Creeper Ivy<br />
<br />
This will take you all the way to 250, but very slowly, I dont reccomend applying these either, the poisons sell for 12pp 9gold roughly, and takes away a lot of the financial pain to sell em back.  If you want to max out apply, its better to go back to one of the cheaper poisons, say calcium rot, or something without a trivial limit, and max apply with that.<br />
If you find something better to max apply with, plz post it, as I am still at 150skill and not sure of what cheaper poisons max it out or not.<br />
<br />
Another option is going to HH, telling anson &quot;I want to see stanos&quot;  and then training poison to 250 him.  it will cost you a lil over 100pp for each training pt after 200 skill.  This is slightly more expensive than actually doing the training.  Especially when you get close to 250 and nearly make a profit off of spirit of the sloth.   Question is really &quot;how valuable is your time?&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope this helps some of you who have an interest in joining the ranks of the proud and few poison makers of Norrath<br />

I'm currently at 237 make poison skill and between farming unrest for skins to make my own vials and fine steel to hock to vendors, I don't think I've actually LOST any money. I've been selling the poison back to the vendor and making iron dimethyl. (That's from around 211 skill to 237 when I was actually paying attention to such things )<br />

<br />
Get a crude stein and use it when buying components. Easy to get item and 15 cha helps. Charisma adds up when you start buying 100 items.<br />
<br />
Round up whatever int gear you can lay hands on. It makes a HUGE difference in my success rate to go from 75 int (normal) to 115 int which is what I was at the last time I worked on poison.</div></div><hr />

I am at 180, gotta farm some cash to train up to 200 and still have 20 points after that...<br />
<br />
If he can train past 200 i would rather work on doing like Zek Frost, Stiffining Ergot and Visceral Rot and then use the points, i might just do that to test and save the points for apply too, but seems apply is cheap enuf to raise.  Don't ask what my apply is, cuz it is sad...<br />

<br />
Stanos can train you over 200 in make poison. He can train you all the way to 250 if your pockets are deep enough.<br />
<br />
A lot of people are going this route once they get over 200, as it is undeniably easier, and quite likely cheaper, than making spirit of sloth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stanos is part of the Ragebringer quest. You can check the guide in the Library for info on getting him to spawn. <br />
<br />
Do you need to be over 50? I don't know. I am so I can't say.<br />
<br />
Do you need to do the pouch quest first? No. I never did it, I just walk up to Anson and say &quot;I need to see Stanos&quot; and he spawns.<br />
<br />
As for the cap, the cap is 20 on tradeskills. Make poison is not a trade skill, it's a class skill. It can be trained to 200 at a regular trainer, and higher with Stanos.<br />
<br />
Personally I got up to 218 this weekend and whipped up my first batch of mind melt. Nice poison there.</div></div><hr />

Just one question, hehe wish i knew about being able to train the make poison, any idea how much it is to train at both trainers &amp;amp; Stanos?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

**Edit**  Just checked and saw that make &amp;amp; apply poison are NOT available to my rogue from trainer.  Maybe this was done away with in a patch???  Havent checked Stanos yet.   Shakal <br />

<br />
The same as to train any other skill. The price goes up as you get higher and higher. Over 200 you're paying over 100 plat per increase. It's still cheaper and easier I think  <br />
<br />

<br />
From which trainer? I have a silver piece that says you looked in Frionia Vie. The trainer in FV has never offered those skills for some reason, about which we can only spectulate. Go to a regular trainer and you'll find them, as you will with Stanos and Anson.</div></div><hr />

I have not really seen it move from there I must say, after countless attempts in FV.  I will try Stanos tonight I think, seeing as how he was a gem I did not know about prior.<br />

Granted that leaves my apply pretty low, but that's fine, I have more patience on that.</div></div><hr />

Reason:  Spirit of Sloth buy-back price with Brak is greater than the component cost, raising 200-250 skill with him, while selling back the successes, is actually a net profit.</div></div><hr />

When I went to get my Ragebringer the Ph was up.  I hit him and ran to guards via the drop off in front of the keep.  They never came after a few minutes, so I zoned to Highpass keep and came back.  While swimming back to the smuggler area, I saw 2 smugglers in the water that weren't there before.  I believe these were the PH and another aggro that were trying to get to me, but they got stuck in the water.  I went back to where Anson was supposed to be and there was nothing.  About 10 or 15 minutes later Anson popped and I turned in my newbie note...err daggers and pouch and got my Ragebringer : )</div></div><hr />

without making vials, word is it costs about 10k this way.  Add like 3k more abouts if you plan on buying youre way to 250 at stanos instead of hanging in FV. Edited by: Furina Goldfinger at: 1/8/02 3:48:57 am</div></div><hr />

i thought i heard somewhere that how high your dex is will also affect how well you successfully make the poisons and adds to skill raises... wis does this also on sucesses and int on the skill raises. <br />

<br />
depends on your level i guess.  but ive comfirmed i can farm vial pp faster in sol a at 58 then i can gather skins.  By the vial it favors farm pp<br />
<br />
<br />
skins dont do a total mitigation of the cost either.<br />
<br />
someone says it takes 4k more to go to max skill if you buy vials (estimate).  all of that is clearly vial cost so your saying bout a 1000 vials.  THATS A 1000 SKINS!  /shudder   there can be no clearer demonstration that farming pp to buy vials is faster.</div></div><hr />

If you look, you'll see a hill with a stone marker on it. This hill has a fair size camp of undeads that respawns in about 2 minutes. Varies between zombies, skeles and gouls. I agree that it is less time consuming to just buy the veils, far easier to just get plats to buy the things than it is to get pelts/skins to make the veils, but I am also trying to raise my pottery skill, so untill I trivial on veils, I'll just keep making em.<br />
<br />
I just went with the route exlained here, but when I started making the sloth poison and seeing all the failures for combine and thinking the most expensive part is the veil and that everytime I fail, I retain the veil...........<br />
<br />
Why not just start out with the hardest poison first? Buy maybe 20 veils and you'll raise to over a 100 skill, fails and all on probably just those 20 veils. You'll not make many poisons to practice apply, but from the looks of it, apply seems to work most of the time even at low skill. Get high intel gear without raising wisdom, the point is to fail on the combine, but to learn from the attempt.</div></div><hr />

The detailed information is also a great time saver. I have sent dozens of rogues looking for PM advice back to this thread and have updated eqtraders with a link to this post, and a fix for their broken link to the Safehouse Tome of Mastery (it's pointing to the old one, which unfortunately just gives them an error msg). <br />
<br />
Currently I am at 225 (*grr, originally put in my new fletching stat 234) and have found that if you bring charisma gear with you, and make your own sealed vials - you CAN turn a     profit making SoS and selling back to the vendor. With Cha gear on mine are selling back at 14pp 2g per poison.<br />
<br />
I am making roughly 6pp per poison (that includes my costs for making sealed vials), by first wearing my best dex gear (207 dex) and then swapping to Charisma gear (128cha) to sell and buy more suspension and creeper ivy.<br />
<br />
It's a chore collecting the skins and making 10 stacks of vials in a sitting, but I've made 3600-3700 going from 200 to 225. This is several days work (two evenings to be exact) so it's no get rich quick scheme, but if you can raise your poison level and get a bit of pp in the meantime, then it's well worth the time to put into it.<br />
<br />
Re: Apply poison. I am sitting at 120 and for me, see no need to waste the poisons, low level or otherwise. I've failed only one time in my entire poison making using career, that includes high skill poisons such as Spirit of Sloth. If I start failing to a noticable degree, I'll make some cheap chit and work on it.   Edited by: HarloweRogue at: 7/9/02 10:53:15 am</div></div><hr />

Your guide really made it a cake walk for me and one I send every random tell I get from other rogues aspiring to dabble in PM'g to after I give them the basics. <br />

Yes, I am one of the goobs that is going to put points in AA Poison Mastery too. I like the shorter apply time and no fail apply aspects. Though I honestly haven't failed an apply since it reached 100 in that skill. <br />

I've managed to get all the skins I've ever needed for a few gp each off vendors.  Now that pretty much all skins stack, and vendors show 80 slots of inventory, its much less work to find skins that way.  Black Wolf and Puma skins are not used in tailoring/leather padding, so they make dandy vial skins.<br />

<br />
With 150 int I raised 5 points out of 60 combines on Spirit of Sloth, 171-176.<br />
<br />
With 255 dex I raised 9 points out of 60 combines on Spirit of Sloth, 176-185.<br />
<br />
A friend did a similar thing with smithing.  He maxxed out his str and tossed his int gear and his skill increases nearly doubled.<br />
<br />
VI has stated that tradeskills take the highest stat out of int or your primary tradeskill stat and applies it to your skill increase.<br />
<br />
So, since it is much easier for a rogue to max dex, save your plat on int gear.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for those who don't have deep pockets.  Frosty daturas off of yetis in Dreadlands.  Between two caves in 15 minutes, I got 20 frosty daturas, Cranial Cryofreeze btw, which will take you to 221 or so.  Since it also uses Larent Suspension, it is a bit cheeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dave Th</div><div class="date">10-20-02, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the guide it got me from L20 to grand master in 4 eye bleeding days.<br />
<br />
I would ammend the original write up though becausse making Sloth posion is much cheeper than buying skills. At 172 skill I wen to see how much it would cost for a level up, 47pp; then I compared it to making Sloth 11.3 to make (if sucessful) and 5.0pp if I failed (With all my chr gear on). Then I could sell the posion for 14.2pp. Even with a 75% failure rate skill points were only costing me 27pp each which is much cheeper than the trainer. By the time I hit 210 I was breaking even on cost per point. I had 3 saved AA points so I trained Posion mastery L1 at 215 skill and then my fails dropped to the point I was making a good chunk of cash training these skills.<br />
<br />
I trained posion mastery not for the 10% skill increase, but for the no fail apply. I did not want to waste my time hunting greens just to make posions to train this skill (and it would have cost much more than making posions). So now I will always apply posion even if my skill sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aplying takes time, and does not seem to be required with the new poisons. I definatly plan to sell everything back i make, mainly to save time.<br />
<br />
Tocfodder also sells lactera for contact2 poison. Nice poison to actually use for the free dam, and trivs at 108.<br />
<br />
I would probably reccoment taking suspension and vials to steamfont rather than draggin kings thorn to the vial merchant. The vials recycle on fail, so less draggin in total.<br />
<br />
Not sure if there is a poison vial merchant in PoK, but if not the closest merchant to steamfont would be porting to FP or FV. Ishwar - level 55 Barbarian Rogue - Wind of Tranquility - AB server</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">storgue</div><div class="date">11-03-02, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a good question and prompts an overdue reply on this topic.  Thanks to my many good friends on torv I have quite the poison ingredients larder, so a month or two ago when the news came out about the GM poison trophy, I knew it was time to finally make my move.<br />
<br />
I used the new casserole recipe to up my pottery close to 200 then cranked out over 400 vials from all the ingredients I had stashed on mules.<br />
<br />
I have a great collection of dex and intell gear and friends who kept me well supplied with the chanter KEI buff as well as a couple shaman dex buffs.  I went for max dex (255) and kept my intell from 176 to 216. Also plenty of charisma gear so I could quickly go to 121 charisma when buying or selling. I also have allied faction in Thurg and amiable in FV.<br />
<br />
I can't give you an exact number, but somewhere between 208 and 218 skill on SoS combines/sells my money started moving back upward again and the total run from 182 to 250 (including pottery costs for casserole dishes and the GM trophy vial which I nailed on the first attempt) was within 1.5 K of breaking even for the whole venture.  <br />
<br />
So thanks for all the poison making tips in this topic, they certainly helped a ton, now just do it ! You'll be glad you did.<br />

It is in the game for the rogues that don't make their own poison. Apply Skill = Make Skill. If your Make is at 250 than so is your apply, only behind the curtains. If you don't make poisons than you must practice applying which then results in actual failures. Hope that clears up a lot of questions.</div></div><hr />

If you pass either of the checks you succeed, thus if you have high make poison then you don't really need high apply poison.<br />
<br />
I've never heard anything like this before, I'm just interpereting what I believe he meant.</div></div><hr />

Higher Apply also affects how long it takes you to apply old school poisons as well as the chance to apply them in the first place.<br />
<br />
Apply has no affect on PoP poisons.<br />
<br />
Apply raises as it's own skill totally separate from Make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took me a few hours and a couple of thousand borrowed plat (thanks guildies), but I got MP to 180; and that was starting from scratch.<br />
<br />
I'm currently searching this board to find out if there's been a list created to reflect the stupid nerf of Player Level vs Applying Poison. I also got the &quot;Your Level Isn't High Enough To Apply This Poison&quot; message. Kinda sucks since I wanted to solo with Sloth in DSP, but since I'm 35 I guess it's the Group Grind for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bigmeeno</div><div class="date">01-09-03, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Followed what this guide said to do last weekend, and in about 4 hours time, I was at 190 skill.<br />
<br />
Then I started watching the costs vs the skill-ups, and saw that it was costing me more than it would cost to just go to the trainer. So I went to the trainer in PoK, and blew about 6k, taking me all the way up to 250 skill.<br />
<br />
I then grabbed a couple sealed vials, and ran to the bazaar, bought the only Artisan's Seal that was up for sale, and on the first try, I got my Grandmaster Assassins Vial.<br />
<br />
Thanks for this guide. It saved me countless hours.<br />
<br />
Two new things due to PoP.. First, use the Ak`Anon portal in PoK, which drops you into Steamfont, making it easy to get the Kings Thorn. Second, use the book in Steamfont (where you zoned in) to zone back into PoK after buying your Kings Thorn, and you can get the rest of the components in the rogues guild. No need to go to Dagnors Cauldron, and its faster, not to mention nice and close to the bank if you need more plat. <br />

If you spend AA points on the apply poision ability can you still get skill dings in apply poison ? Can you still train at a rogue guild if your apply is less than 200 ?   Storgue&amp;lt;BR&gt;<br />

I'm up to 160 skill now (I would be more, I burned almost 20 stacks of Kings Thorn before I remembered - level based!  Note to self, never tradeskill 4 hours in a row after a long day at work EVER AGAIN).  For the first session, I sat in PoK and made the poison.  Then I realized that I had better faction (can't quite manage to get the cha up high enough to get best prices with sneak, and I'd rather spend the cash on something else and do a bit more running) with Toxdil if I used my DE mask, so - well, Freeport and Ak'Anon stones are right next to each other.  I went back and forth all day doing that, and boom, I'm at 160.  Of course, that just gives me another incentive to level faster - more poison skill-ups!  MORE!  I've passed this on to all the rogues I know.  Kick-ass guide.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As an aside. In case there are people wondering how to get that pottery skill up cheaply.<br />
<br />
Make small bowls to skill 102 (Costs about 3PP for 3 stacks of ingredients)<br />
- Small bowl sketch<br />
- Small block of clay<br />
- Water flask<br />
<br />
Don't fire them, and destroy any you make as the sell back price is copper.<br />
<br />
Move on to medium bowls to 122 (About 4PP for 3 stacks of ingredients)<br />
- Medium bowl sketch<br />
- Block of clay<br />
- Water flask<br />
<br />
Again, just destroy them.<br />
<br />
122 just happens to be the trivial level of Thurdagin Gate Potions too.<br />
<br />
From there move on to your poison vials<br />
Lined Poison vial (147)<br />
Poison vial (14 <br />
Sealed Poison Vial (18 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">storgue</div><div class="date">02-16-03, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well you can certainly work your way up a lot of the way by farming.  You'll need to farm skins and do the vial work through pottery.  You save a ton of PP on vials that way, but you do trade time for the savings.  The same goes for many of the other components in poison making, though you can never farm the suspensions.  Unrest is always good for zombie skins. Lavastorm can be decent components at low skill and Sol A and B both have poison components it might be worth while to stockpile and save for later.<br />
<br />
For me, I was happy enough with the savings from making my own vials to use the vendors mentioned here to skill up. You can have one hand wash the other by having animal poisons ready for work in sol B and OT and their are components you can gather there for further skill ups.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />

You can make a Casserole Dish. The sketch is sold only in Jaggedpine Forrest but the vendor is at the zone in area from Surefall. There is one downfall to this, you have to make ceramic lining (ceramic lining scetch, small block, water flask...fired with a Quality sheet. low trivial) and they do NOT stack. There is a lot of running around buying water and blocks, but it's less time consuming than farming zombi skins.<br />

3 issues:<br />
- Sealed vials can be found pretty cheap in bazaar (found some at 1p even =) - gains time &amp;amp; possibly money over pottery<br />
<br />
- After 150 skill, the raising was soooo sloooow that I decided to start the training using my extra points (I had kept 88 ) . Price is around 39p a one point raise, but that sure was cheaper than buying hundreds of components and vial-making... imo, of course).<br />
<br />
- Apply poison didn't reach more than 90 when my Make poison skill came at 150... goes pretty slow too.<br />

    I'm a lvl 59 rogue, and my skill is at 163. I have really been wasting time in SolB. This guide will save me lots of time and money. The components in SolB arent that easy to get. They dont drop as often as you would think, and being a rogue. After killing about 20 kobolds I am constantly running around begging for a regen. You can buy the supplies from the merchant at the Rings in Lava but She'll rip you off lol. Question, as a Barb rogue I have trouble getting into the rogue's guild in FV (too big I guess). Can you use DE/IKS illusion in there without getting attacked by the guards. I was thinking i could sneak/hide in under DE/IKS illusion, but upon trying to purchase an item won't They try to kill me ?<br />

Quite right! The per point price at 150 skill was 75p at CHA 52... and 50p at CHA 152! Definitely get as much CHA as you can when you come to raise the skill by your trainer!<br />
<br />
Quote:after skill 200 skill if you want to train at trainer you must visit Stanos, no idea on cost for that because I am only lvl 47 myself.<br />
Wrong. Pop HLF trainer trained me over 200. I'm sure he can train all the way to 250. Cost is from 50p at 150 to about 90p at 200+ with 152 CHA.<br />

<br />
Ok i had a skill of 22 to start with, i took 7k from the bank in high keep and walked to stanos. but i trianed to 200 with the other lady first then called stanos.<br />
<br />
i got to 225 with 2500pp (not quite accurate) left from my 7k. <br />
As i can't gain any more kill till i level i'll have to wait.<br />
<br />
i did this with a cha skill of 164 (unbuffed all items).<br />
<br />
i did it in about 1 min which is so dam cool, but as you can see its not cheap and i now have a low apply skill. <br />
<br />
These are some of the draw backs in doing it that way but i feel it is worth it if your a light player like me, i am also scared to get RSI LOL.<br />

i'll try and get some possitive numbers but i lost them as i LD on the way to High keep arrrg<br />

The skill that is check is make poison not apply poison. At 250 skill in make poison I made mine on the 4th attempt. So be ready to waste some cash into that.

You save countless hours and frustration by doing it that way and not farming for days on end and by straight training it via npc guild master it only costs 5k or so...I forget how much because it has been awhile but what the hell are the training points that we rack up for except to get us through big road blocks?  hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Catweazel The Rogue</div><div class="date">11-22-03, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I would share the path I took to master posion making.....really a summary from all information here and eqtraders.<br />
<br />
1. I did not bother with tradeskill buffs. My int unbuffed is 120 and I found no difference buffing this to 140 on likelihood of successes.<br />
2. This is not as expensive as people make out. You need around 3K maximum to start off, but you will get that back.....and more!!<br />
3. Max your charisma for buying and selling back to the vendor. This is way more important than the &quot;mind&quot; buffs.<br />
4. Unless you really need to for other reasons, don't bother making your own vials. They are the cheapest component. When you are paying +100pp a stack for components, saving 1pp on using your own vials really is not worth the extra clicking.<br />
5. As you get higher in levels on Make Posion, you will get barren times for skill ups. I have gone through over 100 combines and not achieved a skill up, especially around 195 to 205 although I think this is purely random. Skill ups came with no pattern at all and happened 99% of the time on a successful combine but also occurred on failed combines.<br />
6. I did this all in 2 nights (about 8 to 10 hours maximum). It is a major pain!!<br />
7. If you have spare training points, I would suggest you choose wisely when to spend them. I would strongly suggest you use 20 or so to go from 98 to 120 to minimize the time taken to get to a profit and then from 172 to 195. If you do not have that many, save them for the later skill ups when the poisons cost a lot more.<br />
8. The Rogue Assassin Trainer in POK (evil side, middle buidling on the 2nd floor) will train you up to 250. It will cost close to 130pp per skill up once you reach 245 or so. At 190 it was about 65pp per skill up.<br />
9. You can do all of this in 2 zones (POK and Steamfont)<br />
10. I probably ended up with 2000 to 3000 combines (perhaps 30,000 mouseclicks??)<br />
11. I did not bother at all with &quot;Apply Posion&quot; as I wanted to minimize my losses. PoP posions do not use anyway and most old world posions are more expensive than any loot you will ever recover from using them. If you like you can go back to the Athropic Sap purely to raise Apply Posion.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have at least 40 free slots in inventory and 3000pp to start. You can slowly start to reduce this after you get closer to trivial on each posion, however, it beats having to run around to the bank all the time.<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
Start with making Athropic Sap (Buy 63pp sell ??? a stack)<br />
<br />
POK vendors Telir Na`Shalith (neg 110, 1440)<br />
Lined vial<br />
Constrict suspension<br />
2x Alocassia root<br />
<br />
This will trivial at Skill 98<br />
===============================================<br />
<br />
Next you will make Calcium Rot (Buy 78 sell 134 a stack)<br />
<br />
POK vendors - Loran Thu'Leth (neg 115, 1407)<br />
Steamfont - Ennixy Frennor (1370, neg 830)<br />
Sealed Vial<br />
constrict suspension<br />
2x Kings thorn<br />
<br />
For this one, you will have to run between Steamfont and POK. Buy a few stacks of vials and susp then run to Ennixy. Make the Calcium Rot until you run out and then stock up on Kings Thorn and run back to POK....rinse repeat.<br />
After about skill 150 you will begin to make a profit on selling back successful combines to the vendor.<br />
<br />
This will trivial at 172 skill although you might want to continue for a little while to get some money back<br />
===============================================<br />
<br />
Finish off with Spirit of Sloth (Buy 105 sell 190 a stack)<br />
<br />
POK vendors - Loran Thu'Leth (neg 115, 1407)<br />
POK vendors - Ciren Darkbog (neg130, 1425)<br />
Sealed vial<br />
Ethereal suspension<br />
2x Creeper Ivy<br />
<br />
After about skill 195 you will begin to make a profit on selling back successful combines to the vendor<br />
<br />
This will NOT trivial at 250 skill although you might want to continue for a little while to get some money back.<br />

I had the same problem with iron dimethyl. Although I don't know if there's a specific guide for apply requirements, I know that someone in some thread somewhere (vague enough?) said that they needed 161 apply for many of the poisons. Is this so? Dunno, but my skill is lower than yours, and I get that annoying message that I am not a high enough level to apply. So, for what it's worth, you're not the only one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On of the last few patches in December made it so that vendors would not buy back anything for a price higher than the components sell for.  Might change the way peps do poison.  This change was probably in response to the plat dupers out there so blame them...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eumerin</div><div class="date">03-23-04, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick note - there's now a way to currently raise your Poison Making skill to 52 for absolutely free.  Its somewhat time consuming, but there's no money involved at all.  Each of the tradeskills has a pair of quests on the Queen of Thorns in the Discord expansion.  Find the NPCs on the ship that relate to poison (dark elf poison vendors - can't remember their names off the top of my head) and talk to them to start the quest you prefer to do.<br />
<br />
One quest requires you to take items that the NPC gives you, combine them, and then hand them back in one at a time.  Every 100 hand ins, the items given to you are changed to those needed for a more difficult recipe.  The final recipe can get you to skill level 52, and when you've done over 400 hand ins, the NPC tells you how to work with Muramite Blood and Bile (note that no one currently knows why you would want to work with the blood or bile).<br />
<br />
The other quest requires you to take drops from Discord, bring them back to the Queen of Thorns, and combine them with certain items the NPC gives you.  Once again there are four seperate recipes, each slightly more difficult than the last.  However, to counterbalance the fact that you're farming some of the materials this time, you're only required to do roughly 1/3 of the hand ins of the other version of the quest.<br />

Is it worth it to skill up? I have applied countless poisons and have never failed and I think my skill is at like 45 or so. And lastly has anyone found another route to go from 172+ without farming and without the use of SoS?</div></div><hr />

there isn't much of a reason to skill it up, but you can use any old school poison to skill it up, i use spine break a ton and its almost 200 now cuz of it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they nerf'd all Rogue trainers with DoN; I believe they flagged the skill much as other trade skills are flagged at trainers as 'untrainable' over a certain amount of skill.<br />

Great guide, btw - thanks a ton for the info!<br />

Check poison merchants in POK, you may not have to run around all the zones like i did. I know for Spirit of sloth, everything is there atm.</div></div><hr />

Now sitting at 220 make poison and out of money :rofl but the money issues was because of the GM seal quest making the various poisons and the artisan seal (that sucked majorly) 4k per attempt, but its done, now i need to figure out if i need more faction or a certain level... but figured i'd offer my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

Looked in bazaar and was lucky if saw zombie skins for 1p each, and no one really had a lot to sell.  So i did some research and found out you can use Crow's special brew instead of the skins.  They sell for a little over 6 gold pieces per stack, best place to buy is Abysmal Sea and Crescent Reach.  Hope this helps.<br />
