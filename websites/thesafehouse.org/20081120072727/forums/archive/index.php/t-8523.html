Original message:<br />
<br />
The Temariel Vex drops off of the Altar Priest in Akheva Ruins.  It looks like a book, and is a quite nice range slot item.<br />
<br />
I cast Identify on it, and it ID'd as the &quot;Heart of Knowledge&quot;.  I have looked far and wide, but I have not found anything that needs such a thing... I am posting this in the hopes that someone out there might be looking for the Heart of Knowledge and needs to know where it is.  Also, I am just curious. <br />

Makes sense as the Xi Vius mobs are rather dark figures, most being &quot;shadow&quot;knights.<br />

<br />
So, Vex is Heart.  Tamariel is Knowledge.  Xi Vius is Darkness (or Shadow).  Itrear Vius... Hmm, Black?... Complete Darkness?  <br />
<br />
Please, anyone else out there who has an item that is named in Akhevan ID it so that we can figure out this language... Who knows, maybe if we can ask the corrupted remains about Vex Thal in common instead of Akhevan, he will answer some questions?<br />

<br />
Itraer probably is Master, or Lord.  Dark Master, or Dark Lord.  Seems fitting.<br />
<br />
I'm at work right now, but I'm going to check my logs for all the things that have been said upon death when I get home. I know that many of these guys says something in Akhevan when dying, and hopefully we'll be able to translate some more.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone out there have the &quot;Wito Xi Tetoracu&quot; from the Itraer?  That has two words we have not seen yet.<br />
There is also the &quot;Collar of Tavuel Xakreum&quot;.. I just wonder why half of it is in common.<br />
Next time I get an Akuel xi ans Vius, I'll ID it.  Right now it's &amp;lt;something&gt; Of the darkness.  We'll see what Akuel means.<br />
<br />
We also can look into the differnent names of mobs--<br />
Xi Thall<br />
Xi Thall Centien<br />
Xi Xaui<br />
... All of these guys are &quot;Of &amp;lt;something&gt;&quot;.  The Vius ones are Sk's and necros.  <br />
<br />
Shei Vinitras<br />
Va'Dyn<br />
Centi Dator<br />
Centi Atulus<br />

I'm sure I'm forgetting some, but that's all I can think of right now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Solmancer</div><div class="date">02-09-02, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might as well put my two bits in as far as Akhevan translations go.  Though I've got a couple questions:  where did you hear about what Kel, Xauninae, Tekar, and Xundrau mean?  Is that from ID'ing those I assume?  If so, that explains why I'm clueless on a number of these words meanings, let alone how they were obtained. ;)  So here's my list of contributions, and a big dissertation following it.  The question marks indicate my personal opinion about what it means, and isn't confirmed by anyone but me. :p<br />
<br />
Xakra - shade; just seems to make sense given the larva, though &quot;Xakra Kel&quot; armor puts a dint into that being a possible meaning<br />
Itraer - Greater; somewhat superlative, imo<br />
Xua ane matarun - &quot;I have fallen&quot; (?)  -- (death message from Xin Thall Centien)<br />
Centien - Priest (see below on why)<br />
<br />
Itraer I believe 'should' mean &quot;Greater&quot;, given the names of mobs from certain, leaked Vex Thal screenies from An_Anonymous_PersonXX.  (Itraer Liako Xin Thall, etc.)<br />
There are also &quot;Greater Akheva&quot;, according to the bane weapon that drops from Shei Vinitras, which is what convinced me about the meaning.  It makes sense, also, given the type of mob the Itraer Vius is (a special lookin shade).  So basically, &quot;The Greater Dark&quot;, though why it's &quot;The Itraer Vius&quot; versus &quot;Ans Itraer Vius&quot;, is beyond me.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd say Tekar would be better off listed as &quot;Mortality&quot;, versus Mortal Death, but that's just me quibbling.<br />
<br />
Also, Xi and Xin are different.  Whether Verant simply typoed with mobs such as Xin Thall Centien in Maiden's, I don't know, but currently everything means something, if you don't account for that possibility of extra letter(s) in names, or transposition (Xandrau and Xundrau, for instance)<br />
<br />
&quot;Centien&quot; meaning Priest seems to stem from primarily how Xin Thall Centien behave.  The good majority of them seem to be clerics, that I've encountered, and even though others are necromantic or shadowknights by nature, you could still argue they're priests to the power of shadow (Luclin?), similar to how Dark Elves are Necromancers and Clerics in servitude to Innoruuk, and Erudites to Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
There's also the matter of apostraphes.  Some of the trap shades are called &quot;Va Tatrua&quot;, and yet we have &quot;The Va`Dyn&quot;, whatever both mean.  I'm willing to bet Va is a preposition.  Not forgetting, of course, Atulinae`Vius in Akheva Ruins.  &quot;Something`Dark&quot;, unless apostraphes change meaning completely.<br />
<br />
Not forgetting several other words:  Akelha, Ra, Aten, etc.  Ra will likely mean sun, or light.  Don't ask me why, I'm still putting together my suspicions about the nature of the Akheva and their relationship to Luclin herself.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: If there was someone who made up the Akhevan language, and made it relatively logical as far as linguistics is concerned, AND put it in Vex Thal, and elsewhere for potential use by players.. neat :)  Would be fun to have to learn Akhevan to get anywhere in Vex Thal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This just got me thinking... is this how pluralization is done in latin?<br />
<br />
We've already seen clear Latinate influence in Seru, at least. It's a stretch, but a possiblity, that we may be able to follow some semblance of Latin syntax/grammar with Akhevan.<br />

The point is, I believe this has to do with getting into Vex Thal.  But I also don't think VI put as much time into this as you're giving them credit for.   Hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is an armour set (it may be used for tailoring) that is Xakra Kel. There is Xakra Kel Cap, Cape, Choaker etc. This could be translated to be &quot;A Spirit Cape&quot; or &quot;A Spirit Cap&quot; etc.<br />

If they do, in Shadeweaver's Thicket, there's a few camps inside those caverns that ring the zone, there's a warlord tegi (greyish brown type), but that's not important.  Near him is a vendor, I think a bartender, that sells various types of weapons all named things strange, but I'm not sure if it's akhevan, perhaps an ID on them would give some more info?<br />
<br />
And on aggro, the four arm akhevans say &quot;Tortured death!&quot; from the translation guide :) Edited by: Tabbran  at: 2/10/02 11:30:52 am</div></div><hr />

Shadeweavers Thicket has Shak Dratha (little dark grey aliens) and lesser shades (skeletons). The shak dratha drop chunks of condensed shadow, which are found here and off of aliens in Akheva, which helps link them. But anyways, this is what I pulled out of my log files:<br />
<br />
[Wed Jan 09 09:10:55 2002] Auto attack on.<br />
[Wed Jan 09 09:10:55 2002] a shak dratha seeker says 'Tavu theka duthenes! '<br />
<br />
[Mon Jan 07 10:24:44 2002] Auto attack on.<br />
[Mon Jan 07 10:24:44 2002] a lesser shade says 'Ura anir  teka xeturi sivuela! '<br />
<br />
[Mon Jan 07 10:24:47 2002] You have slain a lesser shade!<br />
[Mon Jan 07 10:24:47 2002] a lesser shade says 'Xau anir aus diun xeturisun! '<br />
<br />
There are shadows in Twilight Sea that're bigger brothers of the lesser shades, drop similar stuff, but I'm fairly sure they'll polish me off so if someone high level wants to kill a few and see what their attack/death messages are, might be one more datapoint. Not sure what they say when they kill you, I'll ahve to make a newbie kitty and run out to my doom to find out   <br />

<br />
Easy enough   :<br />

Sorry, that's my bad. . .I didn't know where it dropped from.  I was just trolling through the Magelo database, and saw that.  Erased the post to avoid confusion.</div></div><hr />

All I was posting was the name of the item, and the exact item ID, according to Magelo.  I didn't mean to imply that &quot;insignia&quot; is Akhevan for &quot;symbol&quot;.  Everyone here should know those terms are interchangable in most cases.  But I do believe that this confirms that &quot;Itraer&quot; means &quot;Shadow&quot;.<br />

In each one there is a named alien (er, not named. but it's a Seeker or something as opposed to the regular ones.)<br />
<br />
When hailed, it responds in some strange languange with a [bracketed] word.<br />
<br />
When you say that word to it, it gets excited and says something, then casts a spell. I have spell messages off so I have no idea what spell it is.<br />

Something to look into perhaps.</div></div><hr />

This would mean Xiall is justice, and when the mob slained you he screamed Justice! This also mean Ishinaear = Luclin.<br />

Many of the death messages use a form of Tekar which was translated as Mortal Death.   I've been collecting messages for the last few weeks as well as the ID lore on the items found.  Still missing a few pieces as I can't figure out a decent portion of the phrases.  Hopefully as Shei Vinitras and others are killed more often some new items will break the language down a bit more.  Once I get my notes in order more I'll post what I have.<br />
<br />
Also, not sure what faction level I need but amiable with whisperlings won't get you the amulet container... and I've farmed Akheva for all of 58     Gonna take alot of work to get to ally.<br />
<br />
Still we are missing something, either the rings aren't in game or they just aren't even close to obvious.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ittingles</div><div class="date">02-11-02, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok earlier on this page someone mentioned Latin, and how Akhevan might be using Latin rules for expressing plurality. Well I don't know if this will help, but I've studied latin for a long time, and understand language construction in general pretty well. The example cited above is exactly opposite the impersonal gender in Latin. For example:<br />
<br />
consilium = counsel, neuter singular noun<br />
consilia = plans, neuter plural of consilium<br />
<br />
I'm sure we could be on to something here, but I'm not expecting a straight up cross over from one language into Akhevan. More likely we will have a hodge podge of elements from many languages. I am sure that even if Akhevan doesn't have a consistent grammar that we could make a lot of headway pursuing this path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ittingles</div><div class="date">02-11-02, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">going back to the xakra example, the parallels to Roman culture are beginning to jump out at me. Xakra almost certainly means spirit, but in Roman culture, spirits were also known as shades. Shades were dead people that weren't good enough to go to Elyssium, so perpetually wandered the underworld, though sometimes the shades were allowed back on earth, and other times the living were allowed down to hades. So Xakreum is the plural for Xakra, which is roughly &quot;shade&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; or more generally as an adjective &quot;pertaining to the underworld&quot;<br />
<br />
now I'm hooked, i'll have to make a closer study of Akhevan and see what I can figure out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The remains say the spirits of the Elysians are caught in a &quot;shadow curse&quot;, which likely was inflicted about them by the Akheva (the faction adjustments from turning in skulls leads me to that conclusion).  So likely, Luclin herself (my suspicion), or one of the more powerful Akheva is feeling simply evil.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More along the Latin thread..  I posted this earlier... but got a HTML comment thingy<br />
<br />
Si or Se at the end of verbs in Romantic languages (with Latin roots..  spanish, Italian, ect) causes the verb to become reflexive..  i.e. the Word lavarse, Lavare means to wash..  Lavar SE means to wash ones self..<br />
<br />
Quote: [Thu Jan 10 14:38:35 2002] a shak dratha raider says 'Xiallsa! '<br />
<br />
So with Xiall meaning justice.. even though its kinda breaking straight latin rules with the addition of the reflexive on a non-verb (unless the word justice is an action in this language) <br />
Xiallsa must mean &quot;I have gotten justice for myself&quot; or something similar  &quot;Justice for me&quot;  &quot;Justice by me&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, Xiall = justice.<br />
<br />
So what does Xiallsa mean?  Well, it's pretty close to justice, obviously, but not the same.  Well, what could be close to it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ha ha ha ha.  All your bases are belong to us.<br />

Xiallsa = FOR GREAT JUSTICE!<br />

I doubt the Akhevan language will show too much in the way of grammar beyond the basics like plurals etc. Building up a set of translated phrases is the most important thing, that will produce a sort of Rosetta Stone.<br />

Not sure how/if this fits into the big picture, but I found it an NPC in the big Coterie Castle in TM that gave  Akheva, and  Shak Dratha. The oddest part to me was that he actually looks like a Xi Xaui type mob from ME. The NPCs name was Emissary Oomgado, I wasnt pulling so not sure if he was on the 2nd or 3rd floor, and I only saw him the 1 time in many days of killing Vamps.<br />
<br />
The Faction Changes:<br />
<br />
Order of Autarkic Umbrage - Down - Who is this? Anyone see that before?<br />
Coterie of the Eternal Night - Down<br />
Valdanov Zevfeer - Down<br />
Akheva - Up<br />
Shak Dratha - Up<br />
<br />
I have not seen this faction hit on anything else. I would really love to know something about &quot;Order of Autarkic Umbrage&quot; since I took a hit with them. I know it's not more language info, but it could help to know about this at a later time.</div></div><hr />

Also, I think VI has used some ancient egyptian references before, the drolvargs for example look like some of the beasts from &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;  (granted those are hollywood created creatures, but I think the designers probably did some homework before making them.  I am certainly going to look for more information and clues!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nelven60</div><div class="date">02-17-02, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The shissar temple (Ssra) also resembles an Egyptian type place.  You can even see a few 'cave drawings'  on some pillars throughout the temple.  Also as far back as Sebilis crypt has some Egyptian style grafitti on the walls. <br />
<br />
There is also a pretty nice Rog only weapon that drops from the Thought Horror Overfient called  Tor Vignus.  I don't have one however so I can't ID it. <br />
<br />
--THO is in The Deep, and THO spawns near the zone to Ssra Temple.  -- The Deep is connected to Echo Caverns (which some of the alien bogglings live in, as well as a Taskmaster Shissar). <br />
<br />
-- Echo is 'ghetto' connected to Fungus Grove which has alot of different types of mobs in it, introducing the Tarmuks (which are in Dawnshroud as well leading to Maidens, Umbral each getting progessivly harder). There is a Cat NPC near Twilight that is a quest person.. forget what he asks about though <br />
<br />
 -- Fungus Grove is attached to  Twilight Sea ( where the other shade types are).<br />
<br />
 -- Twilight Sea is connected to Scarlet Desert  where the alien camps are that talk to us in their own language. <br />
<br />
If you can see where this is going... all the zones are connected in some way.   I would count on clues being found everywhere in Luclin.  The Shissars like to use names to distinguish  rank  Rhag'Zadue,  Rhag'Vezzoth , Arch Ligh Rhag'Zadune... etc.  Perhaps some Ssra items ID in Akhevan.  Could be worth looking into. <br />
<br />
GM said something about once we figure out what's going on in Luclin there will be little desire to go back to ToV, or Kunark.  This has definite potential to peak major interest imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly, I took a look at the words... a lot of them are the same length as the word in common... Vius for instance could be dark, instead of darkness... /shrug... I'll keep looking for clues..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Haldin Darconis</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also noticed that a lot of the words were the same length..<br />
<br />
xi = of<br />
ans = the<br />
<br />
... and others.<br />
<br />
But, there are also a lot that don't match up.  However, and this is somewhat remote, they could be doing a multi-letter substitution.  Examples could be like &quot;-ing&quot; is &quot;-al&quot; in Akhevan.  I doubt this is the case, but I'll look into it.<br />
<br />
On another note, usually with simple character substitution, words don't look like words.   Since vowels are often replaced consonants, usually things just don't look like a real language.  All of the Akhevan words appear to be pronouncable (albeit with some difficulty...   ), so I have my doubts that it's character substitution.  <br />
<br />
Most likely it's just a word = word translation.<br />
<br />
I hunted in Akheva last night, and killed some interesting new things and found some new words to try to translate.  They're at home, and I'm at work, so I'll have to check into it tonight.  I'll post them later.<br />

<br />
I am new to this discussion but it seems to me there may be some conection to the light and dark sides of the moon.  Could there be two factions to those who follow Luclin?  Could Luclin have two faces? two names? <br />
<br />
I have a few items from TM that are strange.<br />
<br />
Mark of Peace<br />
Mark of Nature<br />
Mark of Music<br />
and a silver gilded bracelet<br />
<br />
All are no drop lore<br />
none<br />
none<br />
<br />
They all drop off differently named Coterie.   i.e. Duelist, Guard, Trooper, etc.  No idea of why coterie would be connected, but they do have a complicated faction hit when they are killed.  5 or 6 different factions if I'm not mistaken.<br />
<br />
Someone may also want to check with the Casters in Katta.  I will try and find out who said it, but I recall one said something that reminded me of the Akevian stuff.  I didnt think twice since I was looking for the NPC which gave out the blood ash faction quest stuff.<br />
<br />
Any idea of a connection?</div></div><hr />

No one really knows how big that black mass is in the center. Who knows, it may be hollow.

<br />
I was leaning toward &quot;(a) Priest of the Knowlage of Death&quot; just beacause it runs together smoother, and would put some use to that ` in there. <br />
<br />
Corrections likethat could be put into other translations just to clean them up a little. To help give a clearer picture of the whole.<br />
<br />
Normally i would say that there would be some very huge flaws with VI having to cut corners and stuff to save time for the quest team and programmers. But it reallydoes look like they didnt cut so many of them so far. Really starting to shape up.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the different types of alien guys play a bigger part in the language structure. There's atleast two different factions/species of the aliens in shadeweaver's thicket (active tailoring zone... of.. swirling shadows,, and kitties a-plenty - yea pretty obvious, but maybe not realized) for example. Finding out more about how they came to be enemies may lead to more clues (or atleast expand overall expansion knowlage).</div></div><hr />

Some older languages in our own world use that same method. Like instead of saying &quot;the sky is blue&quot; their language would simply be &quot;blue sky&quot; or &quot;sky blue&quot;. Something to think about anyways, because a lot of the text coming out doesnt really make sense but try looking at it in a different way it may make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">02-19-02, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are at least 5 different types of the aliens. 4 that are &quot;elemental&quot;, and the umbral ones.  Of the 4, Earth, Wind, and Water are all allied against Fire, according to the faction adjustments.<br />
<br />
Gota wonder if the fact that Umbral toilers, and all the different ones in A-ruins all use the same alien model as the 4 elementals was on purpose, or if it was just Lazy_Verant_modeling_trick_099.  Toilers and Co. could have just as easily been made with the robe model, robe with crown, 4 armed, etc.  Unfortunatly I've not gotten a chance to explore A-ruins very much, so I dont know how prevailent the 4 armed and robe with crown models are deeper inside.<br />

I assumed an Akhevan were the hooded type, and a Greater Akhevan were the 4 armed.  Are the small alien types the Centi and they have various tribes over the moon?  (Grol Baku etc).  They serve the Akhevan perhaps?  It would make sense as the mobs in ME are called &quot;an umbrous TOILER&quot; implying that they do some kind of work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabbran</div><div class="date">02-20-02, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The alien types are called Tegi, and are extremely adaptable, cause they can live all across the moon, the Akheva saw this, and took advantage of it, and transplanted a few.  Or, they abducted some Shak Dratha, since that faction lowers when you kill the toilers, they may still be considered Shak Dratha Tegi, but are on Akheva faction.<br />
<br />
But, seriously, there's a couple of Gor Taku (brownish/grey Tegi) shopkeepers in Shadeweaver's thicket, in those caves, near Warlord Gok Thok.  There's a blacksmith and a bartender, and they both sell weapons and alcohol named odd things in the Tegi language, perhaps an identify will add more translations?

Quote:  So likely, Luclin herself (my suspicion), or one of the more powerful Akheva is feeling simply evil.<br />
I don't recall where I read this, but as lore goes, Grieg Venificus was originally one of geomancers responsible for sending the Combine to the moon. Once they found out there was no way back, they hunted Grieg down and chased him to the area now known as &quot;Grieg's End&quot;. Supposedly, Grieg had almost figured out a way to return to Norrath but Luclin caused him to go insane and prevented any return.<br />
<br />
Along with the fact that when you kill Grieg, he says something like, &quot;Finally I am free. Kill that bi.. bit.. witch for me, if you can.&quot; Referring to none other than Luclin herself   <br />

Having studied Latin and Spanish for many years (albeit a long time ago), I agree that this language has some similarities to Latin.<br />
<br />
Lleauaric inidicated in a post that &quot;xiall&quot; means &quot;justice&quot;.  Are we certain that it does?  Are we sure it doesn't mean &quot;vengence&quot;, instead?  They aren't too dissimilar concepts, afterall.    <br />

If speculation is right, and &quot;-sa&quot; makes the word reflexive, then it might actually translate as &quot;Avenge me!&quot;, which seems to me to make a little more sense given the situation.<br />

<br />
Transient Patroller says 'Yikitu uxen jidak! ' (Attack Message)  ... No idea on this.<br />
Transient Patr says 'Grendal ix thilua?<br />
Xi Xaui says 'Atet ial nekiu ura teka ' (Death) ... Death at the end of the message, the rest is new<br />
Altar Priest says 'Xua ka n`Xeturis sa Ishinae' (Death) ... Luclin is the only thing I recognize in this.<br />

Then there are some mob names that I thought might be interesting:<br />
Gel`Temeriel ... Temeriel... That's similar to &quot;Knowledge&quot;<br />
Fer`Tatrau Centi<br />
Diabo`Teka`Temariel <br />

There is also an alien that spawns called the Lorekeeper.  He is a rather rare spawn near the altar priest.  He is between 56th and 60th, but is a pretty easy fight.  I wonder if it'd be possible to get any information from him... Hmm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Haldin Darconis</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I'll try my best to describe the path and area...<br />
<br />
From the zone in:<br />
<br />
Follow the hall to the first junction.  Head straight.  You'll pass through some rock monsters (shade golems, I believe they're called).  When you reach the next junction, head right.<br />
<br />
It's a short hallway, and you'll reach an intersecting hallway.  Take a dogleg to the right through a very short hallway, then head left.  You'll reach another junction with many stacked arches in the back (looks almost Roman...).  Head right.  Beware, this is the first of several Mind Worm traps.   <br />
<br />
After a short distance, there will be some stairs on your left.  Head up these stairs.  More Mindworm traps.  Follow this large hallway all the way until another junction.  This junction will have a pillar in the middle of it.  On the opposite side from which you entered this junction, there's a very short hallway.  <br />
<br />
The Altar Priest spawns in the back part of this hallway, and the Lorekeeper spawns right in front of it.<br />
<br />
I'm going by memory here, so I *may* be wrong with the directions, but I'm pretty sure they're right.  Don't hold me responsible if you make a wrong turn and get yourself killed, heh.<br />
<br />
Oh, just FYI... We've made this trip with as little as 5, most of which are extremely well equipped, but you really do need someone to mez the Mind worms, or else your cleric is going to go OOM from them (they drain mana).  The zone has a quick respawn, so you have to keep moving.<br />

Just a thought, but maybe the Shak Dratha were abducted and twisted somehow into the Centi by the Ahkevan's (sp?); hence changing them from Earth, Wind, Water, or Fire into (maybe) a Shadow Elemental type.  <br />

<br />
Don't some of the fire and water aliens drop a &quot;Chunk of Condensed&quot; fire or water?  Well... In Akheva, they drop chunks of condensed shadow.  Makes sense that they are alligned with the shadow element.  The following is a description taken from everquest.station.sony.co...eities.jsp<br />
<br />
L U C L I N  The Maiden of Shadows <br />
Luclin, the Maiden of Shadows rules the Plane of Shadow, She is short of stature, about 4'9&quot; tall; sleek and thin, with an elfin body structure. Her short hair is deep gray with long side locks down to her stomach. Her silver eyes have no pupils and her skin is solid black. She wears black and gray robes and a shadowy mist perpetually swirls around her feet. In one hand she bears a massive silver and platinum staff carved in the shape of two tendrils wrapping around one another to form two humanoid hands at the top. Floating just above the cupped palms of the hands is a small black orb whose surface has an iridescent sheen similar to that of oil. <br />
<br />
So, the Centi are Tegi that have joined (or forced...) onto the side of the Akheva, and most likely Luclin herself. Edited by: Haldin Darconis at: 2/21/02 7:50:23 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Per a Katta quest (the infamous one involving the  elusive Valdanov Zevfeer), it's known that Akheva blood causes mutations in non-Akhevan entities, when introduced into their circulatory systems.  (Yes, I'm practically quoting the shade.)   It's also known that the Akheva infuse their blood and basically mutate Tegi, which is likely the resultant factor of Centi.  Why they do such, who knows?<br />
<br />
Also, the connection of the (female) shades (Xi Xaui, Xi vius) with the Akheva is currently unknown.  At least, no one I know has much of an idea of what their involvement here is.  Likely, a lot of things will become clearer once people begin to explore (not ransack) Vex Thal, whenever that zone opens to the public, so to speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. -- Centiens (Akheva) are found only in Maiden, Akheva, Umbral, and apparently Vex Thal as well.  I've been through Scarlet a bit and haven't seen one.</div></div><hr />

Heres some info on that from a book purchasable in Shar Vahl.<br />
<br />
Title: The History of Dar Khura Volume I<br />
<br />
Shortly after our city's first walls were completed, Dar Khura went to King Kerrath and told him of a recurring vision he had been experiencing. In the dream, the shaman perceived some unknown force tampering with the balance of the spirit realm.<br />
<br />
Volume II:<br />
<br />
Dar Khura's research was quick to provided insight into one of the races of this new place. The Spiritists grew to know this race as the Akheva. They were determined to be a semi-immortal race.<br />
<br />
Research found that when one is slain, it is reborn anew. Over time, Dar Khura discovered that when an Akheva was reborn, a sacred member of the spirit realm was destroyed. This, he surmissed, was the meaning of his initial visions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gallux</div><div class="date">02-23-02, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I saw the item &quot;Ans Fiel`Tian&quot; I knew we could get a little bit more info out of it than most items. The translation is &quot;The Light Of Day&quot;. <br />
<br />
We know &quot;Ans&quot; is &quot;The&quot;. This means &quot;Fiel`Tian&quot; is &quot;Light Of Day&quot;. I was expecting this item to be called &quot;Ans Fiel Xi Tian&quot; so I was a bit confused.<br />
<br />
One of the earlier posts has some information about a mob in Vex Thal called &quot;Fiel Xakra&quot;. We know &quot;Xakreum&quot; means spirits and I think a lot of people believe &quot;Xakra&quot; means spirit. I searched Magelo for &quot;Xakra&quot; and found a few very interesting items (some are tailored).<br />
<br />
Xakra Bile<br />
Xakra Blood<br />
Xakra Kel Cap<br />
Xakra Kel Cape<br />
Xakra Kel Chocker<br />
Xakra Kel Cord<br />
Xakra Kel Pants<br />
Xakra Kel Sandals<br />
Xakra Kel Shawl<br />
Xakra Kel Shirt<br />
Xakra Kel Wristband<br />
<br />
These items lack the identify information, but I think translation is simple. &quot;Xakra Blood&quot; is going to be &quot;Spirit Blood&quot;. &quot;Xakra Kel Cap&quot; is going to translate to &quot;A Spirit Cap&quot;.<br />
<br />
Making my assumption of &quot;Xakra&quot; being spirit, I went back to the word &quot;Fiel Xakra&quot;. &quot;Fiel&quot; is going to mean either &quot;Light&quot; or &quot;Day&quot;. So I get 2 possibilities.<br />
<br />
Day Spirit<br />
Light Spirit<br />
<br />
I think its pretty obvious now that its going to mean &quot;Light Spirit&quot;.<br />
<br />
So now we have Akheva being a place of Darkness and Vex Thal being a place that contains something related to Light. I know this is a big jump, but so far everything found in Akheva has been related to darkness or shadow. Im not going to make any more assumptions about Vex Thal for now other than hint about it possibly being the oppositive to Akheva or in conflict with Akheva. In sure the Luclin lore buffs will be able to expand further about Vex.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the reason that &quot;Xakra&quot; is not ID'd on things like Xakra bile, blood, etc. is that while it most certainly means &quot;spirit&quot;, I also think that it may just be a proper name for these spirits...kind of like how &quot;Kleenex&quot; is used both as a proper name for a brand of tissue, and also commonly used to identify any brand of the same product.</div></div><hr />

The Xakra bile listed above comes from the Xakra larvae that are found in the pit below Shar Vahl.  These disgusting worm-like creatures don't seem to resemble spirits.  Unless someone specifically translated Xakra as 'spirit' (and not just Xakreum as 'spirits'), I would guess that there is something being missed here.<br />
That would also seem to indicate that the Fiel Xakra may very well be a large worm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Solmancer</div><div class="date">02-25-02, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a thought.  Disclaimer: I babble when I write things like this, please bear with me.  <br />
<br />
Centi is thought to be &quot;Priest&quot;.  Well we also have &quot;Centien&quot;, which could likely mean &quot;(male) priest&quot;.  (The usage of it is on Akheva which are male -- Xin Thall Centien.)  In other words, an -en suffix could perhaps be a qualifier towards gender, to the masculine in this case.<br />
<br />
Same with Xi versus Xin.  Small change, possibly stronger meaning.  Xi is assuredly &quot;of&quot;, perhaps &quot;Xin&quot; could mean &quot;from&quot;?  Xi Vius = &quot;Of Dark&quot;, or perhaps &quot;Darkened&quot; or &quot;Shaded&quot;.  Xin Thall Centien.  While we aren't sure what &quot;Thall (Thal)&quot; means, it's speculated to mean &quot;Shadow&quot;.  Assuming so, we could perhaps have &quot;(Male) Priest from the Deep Shadow&quot;.  I put in a few words there, mostly because of the extra 'L' being perhaps a form of emphasis.  I couldn't think of a word that basically was a stronger, more superlative form of &quot;shadow&quot;.  The &quot;the&quot; in there was to make it flow better, and from another thing, see below.<br />
<br />
On to the other stuff...<br />
<br />
Akheva Ruins mob - Teka`Temariel Centi -- Priest of Deathly Knowledge.  Or, even better: Priest *with* Deathly Knowledge.  Simplified, as I see it: Necromancer, perhaps by definition of what a Necromancer is.  (If they're not necromancers/SKs, I'm in trouble   So I'm basically saying that apostraphes here seem to change a noun into adjective or adverb, depending on the word it's attached to.  At least, that's my speculation.  <br />
<br />
Next on the list, implied &quot;filler&quot; words (conjunctions, articles, prepositions, etc.).  Like with &quot;Teka`Temariel Centi&quot;, you could seemingly put in those kinds of words.  See the above paragraph for what I mean.  Meaning, you don't necessarily need &quot;xi&quot; or &quot;Ans&quot; in a given phrase to have that be placed in.  I think those words only give added emphasis to a given name.  Like in spanish: &quot;Soy&quot; means &quot;I am&quot;, but &quot;Yo soy&quot; is still &quot;I am&quot; only the Yo (also means &quot;I&quot;), only emphasizes yourself.  Like *I* am that person.  Versus I am that person.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll quit going on, but here's all that for mental digestion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_farmatyr1</div><div class="date">02-26-02, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a few ideas.<br />
<br />
First, Itraer Insignia translating as symbol of shadow or whatever doesn't mean much. It could be intended to be the insignia of the itraer vius, and just got shortened. So Itraer could still mean greater or whatever.<br />
<br />
Something that struck me when I saw ans used without a preposition is that ans is a contraction of 'an das' in german, where you say the (das here) in a lot of places you wouldn't in english. My thought was that through something like this, ans might imply a default preposition if there isn't another given.<br />
<br />
How accurate is the latin they use? If it's accurate enough that it looks like they had someone who actually knew latin doing names, then we should consider that latin has a lot more forms of words than english does, and Akhevan might follow latin moreso than english. If so, we might be able to establish that certain word endings imply nouns, others verbs, and so on. For example, Xiall for justice (or vengeance, same thing), xiallsa for I will bring you to justice. (pretty sure this was attack message, not death message)<br />
<br />
parallels:<br />
Rygan Anisher says 'Tekar Ans Sivuelaeus! ' (attack message)<br />
a lesser shade says 'Ura anir teka xeturi sivuela! ' (attack message)<br />
<br />
Sivuelaeus is clearly a form of sivuela. Both also contain teka or tekar. <br />
<br />
'Ura anir iashta Ishinae t`tekar ' <br />
'Ura anir teka xeturi sivuela! '<br />
<br />
I suspect ura means sort of like 'I will', anir is &quot;you&quot;.<br />
<br />
'Xua ka n`Xeturis sa Ishinae'<br />
'Ura anir teka xeturi sivuela! '<br />
<br />
Xeturi refers to a PC. Could be 'enemy', 'intruder' or anything like that. Maybe the last sentence says, &quot;I will kill the enemy for trespassing&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm pretty confident that anything that ends in -a is a verb. If we could find anything else with n`(noun) or t`(noun) it would help to figure these out. Edited by: farmatyr1 at: 2/26/02 3:49:28 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps another way of translating that would be &quot;Spirit Worms&quot;, or in their more advanced form, &quot;Worms that drain Spirit(s)&quot;<br />
<br />
If so, that would help settle the conflict between Spirits and little icky wormies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This comes from the fact that the Itraer Vius is female, she has two spells, one of which is &quot;The touch of the Mistress&quot; and we already have determined that Vius means dark.<br />
<br />
Therefore Itraer Vius = Mistress of the Dark or Mistress of Darkness.  <br />
<br />
It would probably be safe to assume that the Itraer Vius is either the high priestess of Luclin or perhaps she is an avatar of Luclin herself in the vein of the Statue of Rallos Zek being inhabited by the god and then spawning the AoW.<br />

<br />
Luclin can be both, since a maiden is simply a woman that is a virgin or is unmarried. And a Mistress in this case would be a woman with ultimate control over something; in this case the moon (which is named after her, which seems to me that she has a good deal of control over the place).<br />
<br />
Itraer casting Touch of the Mistress doesn't make him a mistress, rather a minion doing her bidding.</div></div><hr />

The attack message was posted earlier...<br />
<br />
[attack message] a lesser shade says 'Ura anir *teka xeturi sivuela! '<br />
[death message - lesser shade dies] a lesser shade says 'Xau anir aus diun xeturisun! '<br />
[death message - lesser shade kills you] a lesser shade says 'Ans sivuela ial temar attaumis! '<br />
<br />
I haven't put too much thought into this yet, but notice in both the attack and death message the words &quot;anir&quot; and &quot;xeturi&quot; are used, and in both the attack and kill message the word &quot;sivuela&quot; is used.<br />
<br />
Note, there is an extra space in the attack message between anir and teka.  This could just be a typo (red herring) but some NPCs have an extra space in their speach when inserting the race, name, etc, of their target in their sentence.<br />
<br />
Also, this might not be useful, but here is a gor taku attack message (just looks kinda jumbled to me): a gor taku scout says 'I maku da mlech! Yoo DIE! '</div></div><hr />

A couple of these words look like forms of words translated in Gallux's post...<br />
teka: Tekar = Mortal Death<br />
temar: Temariel = Knowledge<br />
and &quot;Ans&quot; is already known to mean &quot;The&quot;<br />

I think farmatyr1 is on the right track.  Since it seems like people have run out of items to identify for direct translations, we'll have to start deciphering Akhevan sentences of NPCs to get any further</div></div><hr />

We knoe that VI bought on a large number of new developers for Luclin, it's entirely possible that one or more of these had in the ast developed a full language, grama and all for a previous game, or simpley because they could.<br />
<br />
Secondly I've done a bit of cryptology in the past. The recurrance of hard consonants (X, T, V) point away from this being a simple character translation code.<br />
<br />
Also the nature of some of the words (Xi, Xinm Vex, Vius) being easily pronouncable also point away from a character translation code.<br />
<br />
however, the nature of many of the phrases that you guys have already found do point towards a simple WORD translation code.<br />
<br />
So it's possible it's either. Word translation or a full language.<br />

I have a feeling some of these words (if not all) have been taken from a real language.  I think Akhevan is actually... well, something. <br />
<br />
Here's an interesting thing:<br />
latin.gal.ohio-state.edu/...unctiv.htm<br />
<br />
Now, scroll down to the bottom... Vereor (which we've found to mean &quot;Terror&quot;) actually means &quot;Fear&quot; in latin.  I think most people would agree that that's the same word.  So, we know that one word is latin!<br />
<br />
Now, I've done some searching for other words, some of the more unusal ones.  I haven't been getting &quot;Latin&quot; hits, but I have been getting different Georgian or Kartvelian (sometimes also spelled Kartevelian) languanges.   Interesting, do some searching in Google (or your favorite search engine...     ) for some of these Akhevan words, as well as Georgian and Kart(e)velian.  <br />
<br />
I'm going to keep looking into this, but maybe we'll find out what language this is, and then just be able to translate....<br />

Vex is thought to be 'heart' by others in the thread.  I'd assume that maybe it means 'home', which heart in the non-physical sense can roughly mean home, as can home roughly mean heart in the non-physical sense.<br />
<br />
Thal, I didn't see a translation, so unless I'm mistaken, Shadow is the obvious translation.<br />

Personally, I even think that calling it the Heart of Shadow sounds better.    <br />
<br />
Thal... yeah, we haven't found a translation for that.  But Shadow is probably a good idea.  Although Vius means Darkness, which is very similar to Shadow.  Additionally, there are the Xin Thalls, Xin Thall Centiens, and so forth.  Xin seems to be a modification of Xi, which means &quot;Of&quot;.  So that'd mean Of Shadow.  Sounds good... except for one thing.  The Xin Thalls are four-arms, not robes.  Maybe it's just a technicality, maybe not.  <br />
<br />
Ugh, I just hate that almost no new information is coming out about this.  It seems like we're so close to something, but there just isn't enough information. <br />
<br />
Perhaps we should try hailing NPCs and seeing if they respond to saying things in Akhevan?  Perhaps the Shei would like being asked questions in his own language?  Maybe something with the remains in Umbral?  I'm just fishing for ideas here...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a few ideas (read opinions not facts) that just may be correct.  I believe that Xaui means light.  So the robed mobs named Xi Xaui would translate as Of Light.  At first glance this doesn't seem to make sense, but hear me out.<br />
<br />
Dictionary.com defines shadow as:<br />
<br />
An area that is not or is only partially irradiated or illuminated because of the interception of radiation by an opaque object between the area and the source of radiation<br />
<br />
This basically is saying that a shadow cannot exist without light.  Due to the shadow being created by light being blocked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I also think that Thal or Thall means Evil and Centien means Priest (this is based on the fact that most if not all Xin Thall Centiens are in fact Clerics).  This would mean Vex Thal would be translated as &quot;Heart of Evil&quot; and Xin Thall Centien, assuming Xin means the same thing as Xi just as a different gender, would mean &quot;Priest of Evil&quot;.  To me, this makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
Another thing I was thinking was that Tekar &quot;Mortal Death&quot; might actually mean or could be interpreted as &quot;to cause death to mortals&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tell me what you think, please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fiel'Tian = Light of Day.<br />

There is speculation in that consolidated Vex Thal thread that the Lucid shards are the 10 medallion pieces needed for the Vex Thal key quest (only 5 have been found so far though). If the Akhevan numeric system is a 10-based system, 10 numerals (ie. 0 through 9) are all you need for a complete numbering system. Well almost - you need a &quot;negative&quot; sign as well, but we probably don't have to worry about that.<br />

i was just thinking by looking at them, that some  translations are reversed, so if Thall does translate into Shadow, couldn't Vex Thall be Shadow's Heart? Thinking this mainly because if it was Heart of Shadow, it would be Vex Xi Thall, since of translates into Xi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Coeran</div><div class="date">04-19-02, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello! I just stumbled upon this thread and found it extremely interesting, as I am very interested in languages. Also, being Italian and having studied Latin and classical Greek for several years I can perhaps provide another point of view.<br />
<br />
Some Latin influences are definitely there (see Vereor: in Latin is a verb and means &quot;to be afraid&quot;), especially in Grieg's. I haven't been in there a lot, but I remember seeing mobs called &quot;An Atra Somnium&quot;. Atrum in Latin means dark, somnium is dream. Now Latin behaves very much like Italian for some things and requires adjectives to be put in the same gender/number/case of the noun to which they refer and in this case there's a mistake, since atra can be either feminine singular or neuter plural, while somnium is neutral singular.<br />
Taking names from Allakhazam here are some observations:<br />
<br />
A Lucid Vision: (lucidus in latin/lucido in Italian) means polished, shiny.<br />
An Occisor Acerbus: occisor = killer, murderer; acerbus = unripe.<br />
Cubicularius Wringordus: cubiculum = small room; cubicularium would be someone who is in a small room.<br />
Grieg Veneficus: veneficus = poisonous.<br />
Occisor Primorus: might be a mistake, primus = first, most important, so &quot;occisor primus&quot; would mean &quot;Head Murderer&quot; while &quot;occisor primorum&quot; would mean &quot;killer of the first ones&quot; or &quot;killer of the best&quot;<br />
Praetorian Myral: praetores were guards, especially for the emperor.<br />
<br />
Also Latin (like German, Russian and some other languages) has cases, that is a word takes a different ending depending on its use. For example:  homo = man, hominibus = to the men (and no, the homo in homosexual comes from the greek &quot;homos&quot; that means &quot;same&quot;). This might explain the different endings that words have, but I believe it might be a bit too much work for the developers to write down a case-based grammar.<br />
<br />
Coming back to Akhevan, a guess I'd say that Sivuela means &quot;alien&quot; or something like that, to indicate everyone who is not from Luclin, and sivuelaeus could simply be a plural form. This would make them say something like 'I will kill you alien' or similar.</div></div><hr />

I am not so sure that &quot;xi&quot; means &quot;of&quot; given that there are mobs in ME whose names are prefaced with &quot;xi&quot; and &quot;xin&quot; (Xi Vius, Xin Thall, etc), which would indicate it rather to mean &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot;; which, of course, also would mean that &quot;vius&quot; would not mean &quot;Darkness&quot;.

<br />
It was Coeron's post that finally made it click. The Latin has nothing to do with Akhevan. If you think about it, you'll see that the Latin which occurs in Akhevan sentences is a really weak link, like &quot;oh, look, this three letter word here is a preposition in Latin&quot; and stuff like that. The place Latin really occurs is in SSeru and Katta. These are the outposts of the old Combine empire.<br />
<br />
Hypothesis: the Latin used in Luclin is used in exactly the same way that old english is used in LotR. Read the appendices of the Return of the King for what I'm talking about. No, no one there speaks Latin (and hence, Latin isn't useful for figuring out Akhevan), but they speak a language that has the same relation to Common as Latin does to English. Katta Castellum and SSeru are &quot;familiar&quot; to people from Norrath (especially humans/those from Antonica), rather than &quot;foreign&quot; as is Shar Vahl or any of the various types of aliens.<br />
<br />
Akhevan, on the other hand, is a foreign language, totally unfamiliar to people from Norrath, and therefore, to us. The only way to figure it out is from what translations we can get (identifying things), and reasoning from how utterances are used (attack messages, etc).<br />
<br />
/em wanders off wondering what it says about fiction and language that Merry from LotR was actually named Kali.</div></div><hr />

The languages aren't even related.  Pick the words apart long enough, and yes, I'm sure you'll find a relationship with the Latin or Gaelic languages, but you're likely to do that with anything.  I used to study Gaelic, this language structure and system has virtually nothing that's recognizable between the two.<br />
<br />
Latin, on the other hand, is extremely prevalent in Katta, Seru, and Grieg's End.  Given that their history and etc. is based a great deal off of the Roman Empire, that's kinda to be expected.  However, Akhevan =/= Latin.  Dead end.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Apostate</div><div class="date">05-15-02, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Va is an interesting word. In looking at the mobs it comes from, you have Va'Dyn (in vex just Va Dyn), Thall Va Xakra, and Va Xi Aten Ha Ra. If Thall means 'shadow' and Xakra means 'spirit', then we could translate Va as a word to describe the origin of something. Like 'born of' or 'born from' or 'created'. <br />
<br />
Like &quot;Shadow born of spirit&quot; for Thall Va Xakra.<br />
&quot;Born from Rock&quot; would be my guess for Va'Dyn.<br />
&quot;Born of Aten Ha Ra&quot; would seem reasonable for Va Xi Aten Ha Ra.<br />
<br />
The problem with that is how the preposition 'xi' really fits in, since Va would seem to make that unnecessary.<br />
<br />
Now, on 'Thall' and 'Thal' I'm thinking that one is the singular form while one is the plural. The problem is the names of mobs are metaphorical enough where really the singular or plural work in most cases, so I'm not really sure if it is &quot;Shadows from the Spirit&quot; or &quot;Shadow from the spirit&quot; or what. It would seem to make the most sense if &quot;Thal&quot; was plural, for Vex Thal being Heart of Shadows. But who knows, really.<br />
<br />
I definitely don't think Centien means priest, at least in a specific class-way. I'm fairly certain it would have a meaning closer to 'servant' and centi probably a lower form like 'slave'. From the names of akhevan yard trash, there is definitely a ranking system... it would make sense if the names were represenative of a caste system.<br />
<br />
Dablo may be similar to that- I'm not sure that word will be anywhere but to designate the 'rank' of a mob, it may simply mean something like 'Lord'. A lot of the words I feel won't be translateable, and are just things like titles of frogloks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Apostate</div><div class="date">05-16-02, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is all conjecture, so I'm pretty sure I'll be proven wrong on some of these eventually. A few guesses on Va, Diabo, Thall, and Xin.<br />
<br />
After more thought on &quot;Va&quot;, I think it may be similar to &quot;Vius&quot; in much the same way &quot;Xakra&quot; is singular for &quot;Xakreum&quot;. You go from a &quot;eum&quot; to an &quot;a&quot; ending, and &quot;ius&quot; to &quot;a&quot; seems fairly similar. In this case, I don't think it is the difference between singular and plural, but &quot;darkness-vius&quot; going to the somewhat similar &quot;shadow/shadowy-va&quot;. This still makes sense in a name like Va Xi Aten Ha Ra (&quot;a shadow of aten ha ra&quot;) but would also make more sense in the name Diabo Xi Va Temariel (shadow knowledge) and diabo xi va (of shadow). <br />
<br />
Thall and Diabo are both difficult words because they seem to be used alternately as adjectives and nouns, suggesting multiple meanings. Thall could seem to stand in for 'priest', but suggests a more broad meaning than that. Thal, which is possibly a form of thall, would create the meaning of Vex Thal as literally the Heart of the Priesthood, Heart of the Holy, or something similar. Which makes sense since the Akhevans worship shadow/Luclin.<br />
<br />
Diabo so far is only on named mobs, which suggests a very specific meaning if it is a rank. I think 'master' and 'mastery' may fit in all translations, but still might be accurate. Diabo Xi Va Temariel would be Master of Shadow Knowledge. Thall Xundraux Diabo would probably be something like Priest of Weapon Mastery. Diabo Va Xi - Master of Shadows. And so on.<br />

Xin doesn't seem to be a preposition like Xi, despite how similar they are. It definitely seems used as a noun sometimes like in Diabo Xi Xin. Knowing the nature of the mobs it is used in, it is probably something fairly sinister, like 'blood' or 'evil' or 'pain' or something. &quot;Xin Thall Centien&quot; makes it sound like it could be &quot;lesser&quot;, but too many high level named mobs have &quot;Xin&quot;, which wouldn't make much sense. Personally, I'll just go with something like &quot;blood&quot; until I see some more names.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Regor el Wizo</div><div class="date">05-17-02, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VT mobs:<br />
Mobs are ranked like Guk/Seb frogs from lowest to highest:<br />
Qua<br />
Zov<br />
Zun<br />
Pli<br />
Eom <br />
<br />
Mobs also give away their class in their name:<br />
Centien - War<br />
Liako - Pal<br />
Thall - Cle<br />
Zethon - Wiz<br />
Va Liako - SK<br />
Senshali - Rog<br />
<br />
Shades have Xakra at the end of their name and the 4-armed Akhevans have nothing. Rocks are named just using the rank and &quot;Va Dyn&quot; at the end<br />
<br />
So an Eom Senshali Xakra is bad ass rogue shade.<br />
<br />
From the Liako (Pal) and Va Liako (SK) one could assume that:<br />
Va = dark/evil/shadow and Liako = knight or something of the sort.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, more info for you guys to mull over<br />

The &quot;Singultus Proeliator&quot; = sobbing warrior and thatis derived from latin according to what i found on the internet. So latin could be related to all these languages in some form or another</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aten Ha Ra is the person that fades out while handing for the key right? so if FoH killed Va Xi Aten Ha Ra and its a Shadow of Aten Ha Ra that prolly means that the boss of Vex Thal is Aten Ha Ra from the key turn in , i might be wrong tho and if its a shadow of and foH cclaims 2 million hp then she is prolly a badass boss<br />
<br />
intresting topic</div></div><hr />
