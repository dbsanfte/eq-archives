<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-12-05, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleach is another of your typical Shounen Jump anime. The manga runs in Shounen Jump Weekly in Japan. It has been running for the last year, quickly approaching it's 52nd episode. It is very similar to Naruto and One Piece, but is the more action-oriented of the three.<br />
<br />
There are more fights in this series than the other two, and it has more emphasis on sword fights rather than hand to hand / special ability combat of One Piece and the Ninja Technique combat of Naruto. This allows for some very cool scenes.<br />
<br />
Of the three, Bleach has the most &quot;so... cool....&quot; factor. As in, the author likes to draw everyone in very awesome poses, impratical as they may be. The fights are intense and heavily animated. The spirit force gives a very neat effect on the fights and brings the intensity to a new level.<br />
<br />
There is no real running story in Bleach, so it does not look like it will last very long. The Anime is already very close to the manga, which does not bode well in general.<br />
<br />
But, the anime is still VERY worth checking out. It's a fun action show for the guys to watch (and girls too, if you're into that). Does not take much brain work.<br />
<br />
There are many places to get Bleach, the best place to follow it would be Animesuki, as it is still unlicensed (not for long, most likely, unless people went broke licensing One Piece and Naruto).<br />
<br />
Bleach Torrents (http://www.animesuki.com/series.php/496.html)<br />
<br />
Hell-Fansubs are the fastest subbers, and Bleach-Society running close behind. LunarAnime is arguably the highest quality. But, One thing to keep in mind is that, from what I understand, the fansubs of the three are very different. Lunaranime, for example, is my preference because they slightly adapt the translation to fit everyone's personality, rather than being literal.<br />
<br />
This works for me, because Bleach is not dialogue-driven like other shows. I don't want to know exactly how they said it. I like Ichigo to be cussing and bitching with an attitude like your typical cocky high schooler would. Others may not. It is advisable to try all three to deciede, especially during fight scenes where the differences really show.<br />
<br />
The manga is licensed in the USA and Rightstuf is having a 33% off sale until 9/18 so it's a good time to pick up volumes 1-10. The manga has a high recommendation from me, unlike Naruto and One Piece, which got crapped up.<br />
<br />
For discussions, I suggest spoilering any of the current and future Bankai fights. Which means start with the Quincy's recent fight. Those are critical to the story, so it's especially important that they don't know what Bankai is until it is introduced.<br />
<br />
Spoilering is broken, so general talk is okay for now.<br />

<br />
I like LunarAnime's fansubs as well. Like stalkyr has said it has a lot of action in it. I for one wish they had a little more story too it but since that is not the case they seem to have put a lot of effort into making high quality sword fights. Good Openings/Endings also :P (I like when animes have good Openings/Endings heh). Just trying to get this going so I kinda repeated :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But yeah, Bleach is awsome.  It's number three in my trinity of bitchin anime.  Naruto, One Piece, Bleach.  Ninja, Pirates, and sword wielding grim reapers.<br />
<br />
I mean, it is now anyway.  The first 25 or so episodes are just allright, but the next 20 after that are just awsome.  It's just not stop awsome fights.<br />
<br />
As far as the sub groups go, don't do Hell Fansubs.  They come out the same day, but seriously, they guess for like half of the words.<br />
<br />
BleachSociety is the fastest group that is actually accurate.<br />
<br />
Lunar is the best though in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Man, they really need to get those spoiler tags working.  We can't actually talk about anything.  Like wether or not that ice dragon was Hitsugaya's bankai or not!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Ending three is thus far the best. Happy People is just .. .. wierd, esp. since it shows characters in the normal state that has nothing to do with the current sorty.<br />
 <br />
I use Lunar's dub as well, Ichigo cussing, and Gin talkin' all hick just adds to the characters.<br />
 <br />
Zaraki Kenpachi FTW! Prolly make me an avatar of him tomorrow, since Shikky isn't seeing any action atm.</div></div><hr />

Bahaha, you're 1000 years too early to challenge me, young one! I was already in the process of making the first post when you mentioned it!<br />
<br />
Hmmm seems a lot of people like Lunar. I really can't wait to see what the results of Ichigo's training is animated. Should be great.</div></div><hr />

The main characters have been split up for 20 episodes now, and in isolation none of them are very interesting.  I miss the interaction between them, especially Rukia amongst the mortals.  These days it seems when any of the old characters show up I find myself wishing they'd go away so we can get back to the palace intrigue of Soul Society.<br />
<br />
In any event, I have a pretty low tolerance for shonen in general, but Bleach is more than keeping my attention.  And we can agree that sword fights are ******* awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They may not be as interesting in isolation, but what could they have done, really? Group fights? Ok everyone stay back, it's my turn to fight, move on, next person's turn while everyone comments on the fight, etc? It was pretty much a neccessity to give the series more focus.<br />
<br />
I feel it helped develop characters fairly well. I do miss Rukia, but Inoue and Ishida were both developed well, delving into Ishida's past and Inoue's beliefs. And some explaination what Chad's reason to fight is.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm not talking phenomenal development here, even Naruto has better story than Bleach. But it's there. <br />
<br />
But I guess I'm just used to how these things go. I don't think I've ever seen a shounen where the &quot;split up to fight&quot; does not happen.</div></div><hr />

True but Bleach does take the action up a bit more than Naruto at times :P. But IMO I rahter have both (story and action).</div></div><hr />

Yeah I liked it, and I am pretty sure that the ice dragon is not his bankai. He had regular soul slayer and when he did his, sword transformation, it was the first stage. If the last captain tells us anything, they will say Bankai before the summon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure I agree with that.  The sword started out as a regular katana.  I think its Stage 1 was when it grew the chain and claw on the end.  Making the dragon his Bankai.<br />
<br />
If that's not the case, then Hitsugaya's soul slayer operates outside all the other rules they've set for them.  Nobody elses katana sprouts new weaponry without being released first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">09-15-05, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He didn't do Bankai btw.

<br />
Well, I know the answer to whether or not it was his Bankai, but I don't want to mention it because we don't want manga spoilers in here. If it's arguable in the anime, we'll leave it arguable, until it's confirmed, regardless of whether or not we know the answer in the manga.<br />
<br />
And I can beat watching raws. I watch it subbed. :p No point watching raws for series that are heavily fansubbed. In the case of Tsukiyomi, Ichigo Mashimaro, etc yeah I watch it raw.</div></div><hr />

I am deaf so, body language is my primary language, so to speak. I can figure out what everyone says based on physical motion, facial expression, situational context, outside reactions.<br />
<br />
In the case of ichigo mashimaro, I can understand based on having read the manga. Tsukiyomi is easy enough because of experience in anime.<br />
<br />
Knowing written kana and a few kanji helps.<br />
<br />
Then its pretty understandable to watch raws. Never really crossed my mind.</div></div><hr />

For the sake of the justice of heavens, I call upon the Shonen-gumi to slay this vile foe. If you wish to surrender, you must commit dishonorable seppaku. If you wish to be forgiven, watch up to episode 51 and present us your most gratitious apology for your sins. If you run, then by gods, you shall run, and run, and run. But no matter where you run, the Eye of Daduon shall be upon you, and God's Judgement shall be delivered without fail.<br />
<br />
May what little of luck you have left in your pathetic existence be with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
lol. Real good stuff doesn't start till they get inside the death god place :P.</div></div><hr />

Kenpachi actually had me giddy. I was giggling like an idiot simply at his awesomeness. Dear lord that man needs more screen time. :smoke <br />
<br />
Best moment was the head bite. Dear lord I'm glad i wasnt drinking anything when that happened, I would've choked to death laughing.  :lol  <br />

Next episode is going to freakin' OWN. I'm prolly gonna have to get DB's just 'cause I can't wait.</div></div><hr />

Holy hell, that was sweet. too bad Renji got his ass handed to him, was NOT expecting a Renji/Cappy K fight at all. Nice to know my buddy Kenpachi is still wrong in the head. :heart <br />
<br />
I'd allmost put money on Ken-chan bein able to release his sword finally.. maybe figured if icchy could do it, why not him? He's just actin all wierd, even for him. <br />

Rukia is scared of Gin? Sh*t, I'm scared of him, and I'm not a cartoon. Gin should win some sort of 'looks normal yet you know that ****** is totally evil' award. dude is whack, yo.<br />

Question about earlier episode: The creepy as hell captain research bastard that got pwned by bleach sasuke, did he bankai? 'cause if not, i wanna see WTF his really is. That thing was big and scary and if there's even more to it, I'm there.</div></div><hr />

Spoiler response to Leniya's question:<br />
Yes, that was his bankai. In fact, he actually says bankai when he does it :p<br />
<br />
And, Honey &amp; Clover recently ended on fansubs, which probably countered whatever effect this episode may have had :p</div></div><hr />

His wasn't the best fight that episode. And I'm horrible with names, esp. if they are only featured once or twice, and arent awesome.<br />

Ack, i didnt realize H&amp;C ended, I'm still watchin the solar releases, so it isnt ended for me. This saddens me greatly. I'm gonna be depressed as hell now :(<br />

<br />
Holy **** indeed that ******* rocked!<br />
<br />
I can't believe Ichigo just barehanded 3 vice captains at once!  Sweet holy christ!<br />
<br />
I also can't believe that the halberd that was supposed to be the focal point of the evil plot just got destroyed so easily.  Unless...that was the evil plan!<br />
<br />
The 1st Captain must be ****ting himself right now.  He's got like a third of his captains incapacitated, and another third of them in open revolt.  By the time its over he's not gonna have anyone left to protect the Court.  Unless...THAT was the evil plan!!<br />
<br />
I don't even ******* know anymore man!<br />
<br />
I'm glad they didn't show Ichigo getting his Bankai.  If past episodes are models, then they will show how that happened during a flashback when he actually goes to use Bankai.  I love it that they do that, it's much better dramatic tension.  I was actually suprised to see Ichigo because last we saw he didn't have it yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, people are saying that next week is Kanonji filler because of the clip at the end, but I don't think so, they showed clips from the next episode, then added a funny Kanonji thing.  Plus they'd have to be insane to put a filler in HERE.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, I LOVE when he hits the girl VC.  She's just standing there looking shocked off to the side and for a second you think he might not take her out cause she's a woman and also not attacking him and then BAM he gets her too.  That's great stuff.<br />

I think they are just trying to show the beginnings of all of these fights to give the watcher the understanding that they are all happening at the same time.  I hope once they get started though they don't jump around from fight to fight and just show one at a time.<br />

 Pretty boy fight was over so quick :p <br />
 <br />
Sucks that Ken-chan wasn't able to fight Foxbadgerman. At least that frees him up to go kick somebody else's ass.<br />
 <br />
Yourichi was getting owned, that #2 captain chick is a BITCH. Looks like a good Hand-to-Hand fight next up ^^<br />
 <br />
At least we got to see a bunch of releases, the dual-blades were sweet, as was #2's hand-spike thing. Also, with several fights reaching the second half, or totally over with, we can hopefully see Icchi-san whoop some ass &lt;mebbe even bankai!&gt;, and mebbe see where Kefka's bastard child Ichimaru Gin went.</div></div><hr />

Maybe even goin' after Rukia, who knows. Gin is a trip, such an awesome villain.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
You're mistaken there, I've gone back and looked, at no point to they show Gin at the execution grounds.<br />
<br />

<br />
You know what...this episode actually pissed me off.  I mean, I know we had six fights going, but I was looking forward to taking months to show them all.  Then they basically don't show us pretty-boy's fight, and Ken's fight get cancelled.  And they can't even show us that much, Ken just tells us he left.  You couldn't SHOW that?!<br />
<br />
And personally, I think Soi Fong's release is of dubious value.  She hit Youruchi a half dozen times now and it besically hasn't done anything till she gets a second hit in the same spot.  Wouldn't it be more useful too have, oh, I dunno, stabbed her with a sword all those times?<br />
<br />
The only thing I could see it being good for is fighting someone like Ken.  Yeah, a double-tap-and-you're-dead weapon might be useful against a guy who just shrugs off sword slices.<br />
<br />
And haha, deuce changed his avatar cause Bleach is so awsome.  So long wrenchamajigger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the bankai, because I was worried that if he summoned some giant monster then he wouldn't be fighting anymore.  A different sword that just makes him faster and stronger, yeah, it doesn't have alot of WOW factor, but I think for the long run it's gonna be good.</div></div><hr />

1.) Gin ftw! He's like a Bleach version of Kefka, just without the fashion sense.<br />

I know he has to be kinda powerful if he is taking on 2 of the strongest capts at the same time...<br />
<br />
Ya ya icchi fight is good but they could have atlest showed a sword swing or something from the old guy fight :P.<br />

Icchi's fight is sweet and all but Byakuya's Bankai is very dull =/. And as we all know Icchi can't lose :P.</div></div><hr />

While I will be pleasantly suprised in the anime if it goes the other way, I don't think they ever showed the old General's fight in the manga. Unless my memory fails me, that is. But i'm petty sure aout it.</div></div><hr />

You should probably save your money and pick up a Gamecube, a Freeloader and Naruto 1, 2, 3, or 4.  You'll get the same game with more characters :P</div></div><hr />

Farting and Rasengen?  When I select Sakura do all of the buttons do nothing? :)<br />

Kon cames with it. No worries abotu the &quot;Street Cred&quot;, to the right of Rei is Maetel, so that makes me hardcore, yo.<br />

And while the games may be cash cows, the figures themelves are made by independent artists, and therefore approved non-NGE-cashcow merchadise :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">11-18-05, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dude, Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon comes out next month.  I can't wait!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabbran</div><div class="date">11-19-05, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would probably come out to the same amount in the end.  And really, who cares if it has more characters?  I'll take a game with two Bleach characters over 47 Naruto.  Are the Naruto games faithful to the anime?  If I play Naruto, do I get only two moves?  Farting and Rasengen?  When I select Sakura do all of the buttons do nothing? :)<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, I'm sure the PSP Bleach games aren't all that great, but damn!  If I can play as Kenpachi or Yourichi I'm sold.<br />
<br />
No on Kenpachi, sort of on the Yoruichi.<br />
<br />
Regardless, the fighting engine of the Naruto and Bleach games are nearly identical.  You get to play as Ichigo, Renji, Rukia, Sado, Uryuu, Orihime, Hitsugaya, Ichimaru, Byakuya, and Urahara.  The only one worth being is Byakuya, since you don't need anything more than the circle button to win with him, ever.<br />
<br />
The fighting is disturbingly shallow with direction + circle making all your special moves, you push square then x to do your super, which you have unlimited of.  It's not a very fun, or deep game, since the balance is next to nothing.<br />
<br />
There's also this whole card-purchase system that unlocks things.  You get points for winning battles and you can cash them in for cards from the japanese card game (they're just pictures, you can't actually play the card game).  After you buy 200 cards or something, you get old-sword Ichigo.  Oh, and you buy them one at a time and you can get duplicates that don't count toward your total.  Killer idea, huh?<br />
<br />
Then, if you're feeling particularly masochistic, you can unlock Yoruichi by playing through the Gotei 13 mode.  While a neat idea, it is horribly flawed and annoying.  You start at the lowest rank and you fight battle, after battle, after battle, after battle, after battle, after battle to rise in rank, eventually to become that squad's captain.  Nevermind that you don't actually fight that squad's captain to become the captain of it, nor do you do you have any interaction with the captains other than them saying stuff like &quot;Do your best!&quot; in the little text segments between fights.  Assuming you don't lose a single fight, it takes about 90ish wins to become the captain of a squad.  Repeat that 12 more times and you can unlock Yoruichi to play! <br />
<br />
Add on the unholy load times and you're looking at a very annoying time of it all.  I probably wouldn't have purchased the game if I knew how shoddy and rushed it was (who the hell lets flash step combo into a fireball with ONE BUTTON?), but now I'm stuck with it, and I'll probably break the circle button before I get Yoruichi unlocked.<br />
<br />
As it stands, the Naruto games are at least marginally balanced and pretty fun to play if you have three friends, it's all out chaos.  And Naruto will be cheaper:<br />
<br />
Gamecube: $99<br />
Freeloader: $40<br />
Naruto 4: $60<br />
<br />
Bleach 2: $60<br />
PSP: $250</div></div><hr />

SONS OF BITCHES! They freaking tried to off Hinamori and Hitsugaya! We totally need Kenpachi to dispatch some divine asswhooping at this point. I mean, we all knew Gin was teh debil, but AIZEN?!?!?! Damn, that's just totally messed up.</div></div><hr />

Well, THAT explains things.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
And oh man, talk about setting up some awesome fights in the near future... With everyone converging on Aizen's position, all hell is about to break loose once again. ^^<br />
 <br />

Also, Renji wasn't a match for him to begin with, and Icchy was in no shape to fight. Not to mention Aizen seems to specialize in illusions and hypnosis. <br />

<br />
I think you're confused. Ichigo obtained his &quot;hollow&quot; hybrid from when he became a hollow via Urahara's cutting his chain. Rukia doesn't have a Hollow inside her.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to explain any more because I'm not sure if it's spoilers (haven't seen 61 yet) but what I just said can be concluded logically from past episodes.<br />
<br />
I don't think Aizen is invicible. After all, Ichigo hasn't seen his hypnosis yet, right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">12-15-05, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you misunderstood. Rukia has the device inside her soul. After she gave her shinigami powers to Ichigo, she assumed she could recover, because that made sense but what she didn't know, was that Urahara put the device when he got her the faux body, which according to Aizen suppresses shinigami powers and in the end she would have become human if she had kept this device inside her for long. Basically she accelerated the process when she gave her powers to Ichigo.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's that.... O.o<br />

Umm.. yeah... so like Aizen went all Enel and stuff... Hopefully Icchy can get healed up and have a 'fun' match with Ken-chan. That'd rule.</div></div><hr />

Bish&#333;nen &#9654; (helpinfo) (&#32654;&#23569;&#24180;, also transliterated bishounen; literally, &quot;beautiful boy&quot;) is a specific Japanese aesthetic concept of the ideally beautiful young man. On the other hand, the prefix bi (&#32654;) specifically refers to feminine beauty, and bijin, literally &quot;beautiful person&quot;, is used to refer to a beautiful woman. The bish&#333;nen is typically quite slender and not very muscular, with a tapered chin, stylish hair, and an overall effeminate or androgynous appearance. The term bish&#333;nen is applied usually to young men or adolescents; the term bishota is used for beautiful males under the age of 13, and the term biseinen is used for men older than 21 (this is debatable, as sources vary ages from 19 to 24). Bish&#333;nen, though, is the most popular of the three terms, and has become the general term for all beautiful boys. The aesthetic of the bish&#333;nen began as an ideal of a young homosexual lover, likely arising from the effeminate male actors who played female characters in Kabuki theater. It is perpetuated today in anime and manga, especially sh&#333;jo (girl) anime, sh&#333;nen-ai, and yaoi. Most homosexual characters in anime are also often categorized as bish&#333;nen.</div></div><hr />

By the way, I don't know what Bleach filler will throw at us, but for the sake of all things in the existence of man, STICK WITH BLEACH UNTIL THE SECOND ARC COMES!!!<br />
<br />
Oh. My. *******. God.<br />
<br />
It is FULL BLOWN AWESOMENESS!! You thought it was awesome now? NOT EVEN CLOSE! It is AWESOME BEYOND ALL AWESOME!<br />

Even if they focus solely on Ichigo, he's so far ahead of Naruto in terms of being a lead character, it isn't even a contest. Icchy rawks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta agree with ya there, I've been having a hard time watching Bleach. I'm sure it's even worse for me, as a manga reader. There are plot holes the size of the Death Star. Rukia's appearance in the lastest episode was the hugest plot hole so far, aside from Ichigo not being able to Bankai. <br />
<br />
You guys are going to CRY when the manga arc begins. You'll feel that your intelligence was not only offended, but downright ****** by a six foot pole to **** with your brain from your *******.<br />
<br />
This **** sucks worse than Naruto. Mother*******.</div></div><hr />
