I actually am in favor of pulling no punches, this is why this Anime is so unique that people will go out of their way to say, wow, that is truly something unordinary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree that I'm happy they aren't pulling punches, I'm just depressed having seen that. It was more of an &quot;in another world, where everything is peaceful and lovey dovey, I'd have liked to not see that&quot; sort of statement I was making.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like stalk has told me you have to remember this is based off a game. 1-4 was the end of the first &quot;arc&quot; if you will. 5 is the start of a new &quot;arc&quot;. But in the end ALL the &quot;arcs&quot; are connected somehow.<br />
<br />
In game terms...lets say you can pick 3 paths. eps 1-4 would have happened if you picked the left path...eps 5+ would be like you picked the middle path and so on. But i guess in the real game the option dialog you picked effected which part you got to see.<br />
<br />
Im sure stalk can explain it better but i think its easier if you think of it in anime &quot;arc&quot; terms hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-08-06, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify, its something like, you have a time period of seven days, from june 1 to 8. You go through those days, making various decisions, and the end changes. The people's base personalities stay the same, the story and mystery is still the same. But say, you won't bump into Rena in one route, but you will with another. That encounter changes the outcome of the whole story.<br />
<br />
Something like the movie, groundhog day. In his different decisions, you find out various outcomes and hints that you otherwise wouldn't see in another route. Little by little you use those hints and plot points to figure out what is really going on in the city.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

These are not spoilers, because they mean nothing. Knowing this doesn't help you understand anything other than why it resets every 4 episodes.<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, has 4 chapters. These chapters are often called the Question Arc. They are called:<br />
<br />
1. Onikakushi-hen<br />
2. Watanagashi-hen<br />
3. Tatarigoroshi-hen<br />
4. Himatsubushi-hen<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, also known as the Answer Arc. The four chapters within are:<br />
<br />
1. Meakashi-hen<br />
2. Tsumihoroboshi-hen<br />
3. Minagoroshi-hen<br />
4. Matsuribayashi-hen<br />
<br />
The anime only goes up to Tsumihoroboshi-hen.<br />
<br />
Other related information, when the girls go into a rage, this is called more commonly, Oyashiro-mode, or Higurashi-mode. This term is not only contained within this series, but has become a otaku term, defining such characters as a certain girl who goes crazy in SHUFFLE!.<br />
<br />
The game came out on Comike 62, with only one chapter. Every game since then had the chapter before it, and one or two new chapters, with Comike 69 having Chapters 5-7.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">05-09-06, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I feel this has to be done b/c well they are interesting.....<br />
<br />
This is translated TIPS from the Higurashi no Naku Koroni game, which is one aspect that the anime, the manga, and the dramaCDs lack. <br />
<br />
Read only if you want more clues into what is happening...while not truly spoilers it may lessen the impact some parts have due to your guessing.<br />
<br />
Here is one just to get started and see if ppl find it useful.<br />
<br />
TIP #1 (Have to have seen up to eps 3/4)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any drugs that induces suicide? (Ep. 03)<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Are there any drugs that causes a person to commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
Forensics Doctor: &quot;Directly, no&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;The way you say it seems like there is an indirect way, then&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;I meant to say, there is a way to cause a psychological effect that triggers a person to commit suicide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Hmm...that's even a more difficult way of saying it. Can you explain the meaning of 'causing a psychological effect that trigger's a person to commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Okay, let's take a person that has bipolar disorder. A person with bipolar disorder is most likely to commit suicide at the point where his or her mental state switches from depression to mania.&quot;<br />
<br />
The main difference from bipolar disorder to an unipolar disorder is that the former has an active and energized state in addition that kicks in interchangeably with depression.<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;If a patient is in the depressed state, he or she does not have the mental will to commit suicide. On the other hand, if the patient is in the hyper-active state, he or she will also not commit suicide as they are living an active life.<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;That's interesting. A bipolar person won't commit suicide in both states, yet they are most likely to at the stage where they change from the depression state to energetic state?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;When a patient is in depression, he or she has suicidal tendencies in their minds. But, they have no will to carry out the suicide since they are in major depression. However, as soon as the transition to the energetic state begins to kick in, they start to become active once again...&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Oh, now I get it! They start to have the active will to carry out the suicide!&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;That's exactly right. So that is why it is imperative to give patients anticonvulsants during this phase.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;So did Mr. Tomitake have bipolar disorder?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Bipolar suicidal tendencies involve more normal suicides like jumping off a building or hanging oneself, not like an withdrawal symptom of scratching one's throat. That's sounds like an illegal substance to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Yes, Mr. Tomitake's suicide was quite unusual. So some kind of substance was used for his death. Can you explain the first one...the one about the drug that can cause a psychological effect that triggers suicidal tendencies?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Methamphetamines are known to cause symtoms very similar to bipolar disorder. These are known in the streets as crystal meth. Some barbiturates also show signs of psychotic hyperactivity, but this is less common. This one is more known for helping people with insomnia - sleeping pills. &quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Strangely, the coroner's report did not show any signs of substances.. Any other possibilities?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;If you scratch off illegal substances off the list, then all I can think of is a disease. One suspect in this case is Graves-Basedow Disease, whose hyperthyroidism is reported to cause effects similar to bipolar disorder. However, in the case of Graves-Basedow Disease, there are many visual signs in a patient. The deceased didn't have those symptoms so that scratches off this disease from the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Are there any ones that break out more suddenly? How can I say...like ones that matches the deceased suicide in a more unexpected and sudden manner?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;How about acute organic psychosis? To say it bluntly, a person's brain gets damaged and becomes psychotic. While this can be caused by side-effects of illegal substances, it can also happen when brain damage occurs due to tumors or direct damage to the cranial area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;So there is a possibility of inducing a person's psychosis without reliance of substances?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;You said the deceased was surrounded by several assailants, right? The deceased may have had an adrenaline rush compounded by a severe strike to the cranial area which may have induced his psychotic abnormality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Can you say that in more simpler terms?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Kakakaka (a laughter from a more older person). I'm saying the man got hit in the head as he was fighting off his assailants and his mind got ****** up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Hahaha! So what you're saying is that the assailant(s) didn't have any motive to kill him! All they wanted to do was extort some money off the guy, but they hit him on the wrong side of the head!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two fat middle-aged men laughs.<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;....of course that can't be the reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Ahem. Indeed. Whether by illegal substance or by psychological symptoms, the deceased body itself holds the key to the clue. How's that going along?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Oh ****, it's this time already? I'd better get going or Kuma-chan (Oishi's partner) will start to get pissed off.&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Okay. Take care! Have a nice year!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;You too. Have a nice year.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-11-06, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While you could read those tips during the game, the game was much more detailed and had more going on than the anime, so those TIPS were not as game-altering. Where a lot of hints get removed in this, the TIPS have less &quot;counter&quot; to them for you to doubt it's truth, and can really alter the anime the wrong way.<br />

Hmmm that eps was pretty creepy :P. Altho that ending was bs...I mean wtf to blame her for making him go inside...but it was nice to find out more what happens to the missing ppl.<br />
<br />
Oh and that preview seemed to help with what he might have saw :P.<br />

<br />
ummmm ok that was the most confuseing chap ever hehe. But man that last eps was the creepiest one so far...eps the last scene.....&quot;Actually, I'm taking it back!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Also in the eps you could tell kinda that the whole time she wasn't really mion or shion(sp). b/c a lot of the time it seems that the name was interchangable...hell for all we know they could have been dead already...with that chick who died 24 hours b4 they went into the storehouse...<br />
<br />
All in all its a closer step to an answer but still a long ways to go...<br />
<br />
Altho i don't really get it...so what they showed us in the start actually happened...then she just dumped the body into the well?<br />
<br />
But ya that last part just scares the _($_#( **** out of ya b/c she just pops up lol.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also that cop is a major puzzle...it seems he knows everything yet he seems to stay the only person alive...allmost like he is a tool...<br />
<br />
Edit2: I also think Rena is also a pawn in this game...personaly she scares me the most..</div></div><hr />

So the truth behind what happened in the beginning of episode five gets revealed. Rika killed herself because she went crazy from Mion's torturing. :( :( I really felt like vomiting.<br />

This is really disturbing. Another bad end. Poor Satoko too. It's really disgusting.</div></div><hr />

eh the opening wasn't as flashy as others but still sick non the less. But now we finally get to see who this director is...really there is a lot of info that ties the two chapters in this one. I just hope this eps isn't as predictable as i think it is =/.</div></div><hr />

Wow this chapter continues its trend of having less supernatural aspects in it than the other two, and that is what makes it even more disturbing.  I can't believe the note this episode went out on, I can't wait to see how this chapter is going to wrap up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually there is some supernatural aspects in it. Like when he called mion...our little friend was doing the talking...Altho ya this eps is a bit more tip that they all might just be crazy. Altho personally i think this whole thing could be wrong. We actually never saw the uncle beat her up or have abuse. Ya we saw the scares etc but that was after she had been with the doctor...And if we all remember from the first chap that the doctor is really the manager...It is quite possible that drugs are involved in some way. Maybe the &quot;crew&quot; planed all this to happen. Also have to remember the last bit of the eps was during the event. So its quite possible that the first hole he dug has the body of the female reporter (nurse) in it. So when she meet him she was infact dead already. Which is already proven by chap two.<br />
<br />
We also know that they like to cause ppl pain and like to see them walk around in pain. More like toy with there victim b4 they move in for the kill. Which kinda brings back eps 1 with the penalty games. Maybe the plan all along for this eps was to drive him insane to commit some horrible sin so they could take revenge on his life. <br />
<br />
It all kinda fits the profile. He kills the uncle but none know that so they think he is missing....then prob next eps another dies and the curse is complete...<br />
<br />
Guess they could be showing us that all this does not have to happen in a supernatural way (not to say &quot;he&quot; isn't there still). That a persons own paranoia and sespision can drive one insane.<br />
<br />
But who knows heh. One things for sure...the nurse he is with is already dead IMO :P.</div></div><hr />

Well I don't see who those bodies could belong to from the opening of Part I.  Unless there was only one body and it is is Kei and he is about to get tortured in mutilated in the hospital.</div></div><hr />

edit:<br />
<br />
actually i think it was one of the many dead ppl of this eps b/c the hospital was outside the city and the city was blocked off. This just ended diff from the norm in that everyone else died but he made it out this time. My question is how did that one girl die and why the hell did he survive this time?.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
On a side note it is possible that was his body and kei was some type of evil clone (whatever you call what happened in chapter 2).<br />
<br />
Also the thing that REALLY made me wonder was the Dr's suicide and the cop went missing...</div></div><hr />

After Kei fell he landed in the river, and that must have somehow protected him from getting killed with everyone else.  Also I don't think that the bodies in that drainage thing could have been from the village dead, because the news said they died from gas poisoning or something.  The bodies in the garbage had the intestines spilled out and nails driven into the hands, just like Mion was threatening Kei with back in Chapter II.<br />

Well that is a good point but it is possable that it could have happened WAY b4 kei falling off the bridge. From the looks of it the dead body was days old...but i guess thats not to say it could have been kei's body flooting there for days but from the anime it looks like it happened right after the  gas thing or the day or two b4 the gas thing...<br />
<br />
<br />
That too is a good question....him and that reporter chick are prob the keys really. And this is what sucks about not reading the TIPs hehe you have to base it all on the anime but with the translated TIPs it tells ya little things that where happening in the village that we did not see in the anime :P. While it would be cool to read them i think they might ruin the ending or make it too easy to guess being that there a a TON of tips for each eps.</div></div><hr />

Ah its finally coming together at last! I also found it interesting that they made the voice of the &quot;demon&quot; to match Mion's voice finally. Also finally nice to know how the van used in the first chap fits in with everything now...But the main thing that was interesting is the part when the guy walks into the room and tell's about the kidnapping...Dunno if anyone noticed the little symbol the guy had on his shirt....</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason in the anime they are obsessed with punishment type ideas...I figure this is one of the ways they punish themselves so they can be &quot;clean&quot; again. Also she could have prob been sexually abused and this was just her way of dealing with it. Or the father made her do it but i doubt that.<br />
<br />
But at this point we can only really prob base it as just a reaction to her being abused.<br />
<br />
I hope the answer chap's help with this problem but more then likely you would have to read the JAP game TIPs to find out some stuff that went on during the chap that the anime did not show you.</div></div><hr />

Satoko was in the bathtub counting to 10,000 as a form of abuse to her. When soaked in hot water for that long, you get very sick.<br />

So Satoko was just in deinal about his death? I guess thats pretty common in abuse cases i think. Altho why did everyone tell him that he was really alive but he is in fact really dead? or we just hearing what he wants to hear?</div></div><hr />

It's too bad so much is left out. I hope the last two chapters will get animated eventually. The truth about what happened when Keiichi killed Mion and Rena gets revealed in an alternate dimension sort of thing.<br />

I can't wait to see the battle between Rena and Keiichi animated! I hope Deen doesn't **** that up! And I liked how they subtly hinted Rika's part on this whole thing, how the future is constantly reset.

I think the anime did a pretty good job about Rika's part in all this. But overall you would have to watch it all again to maybe come close to realizing this. But if you watched the anime and read the TIPS it would have been easier to find out. Altho i do wish the anime did expand on the whole Rika concept...didn't really like how they assumed that everyone watching the anime played the game.<br />
<br />
And ya that dice roll in TIPs was a good read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't wait to see the battle between Rena and Keiichi animated! I hope Deen doesn't **** that up! And I liked how they subtly hinted Rika's part on this whole thing, how the future is constantly reset. After this, she has a monologue about the dice roll in TIPs which is really enjoyable read.<br />
<br />
Dice Roll TIP....for episodes 25+<br />
<br />
I was bored :P.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Last Night (Ep. 25)<br />
<br />
&quot;...............Soon ......tomorrow is going to be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? ...............Ahh, you mean our death date?&quot;<br />
&quot;............It ended up the same way this time too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know about that. .........It's very similiar, but there are some things that were different too. ......Keiichi, remembered what happened before too.&quot;<br />
&quot;......That's impossible. There's no way he could remember, no, there's no way he could know them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*giggle*.... The more you say it's absolutely impossible, ...the more it makes one think that this is really a miracle, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all over now anyway.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is it really over, I wonder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will soon end. Everything, will end. ......That's right, when the cicadas cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
....Is it all going to end anyway?<br />
<br />
The more times you throw a die, the closer the total will get to the average.<br />
When you throw a die 100 times, during the process, even if you get a miracle of 6s coming up continuously, it's still all average when you total everything up in the end.<br />
<br />
...It's just something enclosed by a preestablished arrangement.<br />
<br />
But, if you throw a die 100 times, the minimum and maximum number still ranges from 100 ~ 600.<br />
Even though the more throws you make, the more likely the future will try to converge at one average value, the truth is, the more throws you make, the more possibilities for the future there will be.<br />
<br />
If you throw the die 100 times, you'll get about 500 different futures.<br />
Throw 1000 times, and you'll have 5000 different futures.<br />
Won't there also be one ending among them where I would actually finish from this neverending dice game?<br />
<br />
......The miracle that Keiichi showed me, it was something that opened my eyes and taught me that it's definitely not a waste of effort to continue throwing the dices.<br />
<br />
Don't give in to something like an average value.<br />
<br />
&quot;...........................&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;............That view of your back sure is irritating. .....I can feel a ton of sorrow from it saying &quot;it's no good again anyway&quot;, you know.&quot;<br />
&quot;...........................&quot;<br />
&quot;......It's not just you, .......I'm also thinking that it's not going to work out this time anyway.... ...But you know, I won't give up until I have thrown the last die. Keiichi taught me that. Something's different this time. ......That's why I'll try to believe in that.&quot;<br />
&quot;...............Rika is, .............really a strong person.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah well, I'm way younger than you anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;.........Uun, ...mumble mumble......, .........Rikaa...?&quot;<br />
&quot;......Mi~.&quot;<br />
&quot;You're still up at a time like this, ...*yaawn*..... you mustn't stay up so latee....&quot;<br />
&quot;......I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep so I was just looking at the stars. I will sleep now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please do that.......... ......Good night Rikaa.......&quot;<br />
&quot;......Good night, Satoko.&quot;<br />

<br />
Well that's a good end to the series. There were a lot of things left out from the Heaven or Hell scene that I would have liked to be added, but there wouldn't be enough time. Although the animation was definitely very subpar at many parts. Especially the deformations.<br />
<br />
I liked the part at the end where Rena was hugging Keiichi, or closer still, the pose she had. I know it's an odd thing to single out, but the way she was sitting down and leaning forward into Keiichi's chest was very cute.<br />
<br />
Good end?<br />
<br />
Spoilers for what happens right after this in the game, the same chapter, that wasn't mentioned in the anime... read at your own risk.<br />

<br />
Overall the ep went as planed but really the beginning was exciting but then they seemed to skip over a ton of stuff and just wanted to get to the little fight scene. Its like they said ok forget the story and subplots and lets get to that scene =/.<br />
<br />
And ya the fight animation was a bit messed up and they only made the key picture scene last like 1 sec<br />
<br />
Oh well in the end it was a good anime but leaveing out the last 2 Arcs really make me sad and seemed to ruin the whole subplot or whatever :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well yeah, they did leave it out. That fight scene is the most important and best part of this arc. That's why they were in a rush to get that scene in. It was a lot more romatic and exciting in the game, though. And more worth the screentime.</div></div><hr />

Trans:<br />
<br />
If you'd notice, those days when we laughed and cried<br />
Have been scattered into pieces of something unrestorable<br />
<br />
Only the sadness and pain<br />
Of just having one lie stacked on another lie<br />
Even if we forget the cicadas and scent of summer that follow behind<br />
We can't erase them<br />
<br />
The vanishing place is being dyed red<br />
Before we knew it, the approaching sound comes<br />
<br />
Only my memories that were cleaved apart<br />
Shine unchanged<br />
Within the bewailing of this dusk<br />
Even if I destroy them, you'll be waiting<br />
<br />
They are being pulled off and turning invisible-<br />
Sadness, and even pain, too<br />
Ah, even if we lose the cicadas and scent of summer again<br />
They won't disappear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">10-07-06, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just watched the last episode.<br />
<br />
Holy, holy ****.  <br />
<br />
So many questions left unanswered...but still, it was pretty goddamn amazing.  <br />
<br />
So they just keep replaying that June, over and over again?  And maybe eventually they'll get one where nothing horrible happens? <br />
<br />
Heh, kinda seems like the ending to Wolf's Rain...it all just starts over again.<br />
<br />
But we still never find out exactly what Oyashiro-sama's curse is, if the parasite thing was a lie.  And do we ever find out what keeps killing Tomitake and Takano?<br />
<br />
I'm gonna have to watch the whole damn thing over sometime and see if I pick up a bit more, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind answering any questions. However, before moving foward, it's probably better to take a few steps backwards.<br />
<br />
You may want to try to figure things up to the 6th chapter on your own. I will clearly label any spoilers to be for which chapter, so others can skip the ones they do not want to read. And any 7/8th chapter spoilers will be heavily emphasized, as they may or may not be answered in future OVA's, or in a manga, or in a game that may be translated eventually.<br />
<br />
So before asking about what everything is all about, you may want to ask about all the little things you didn't understand in each chapter that was shown on the anime. That way, you will have a better understanding of how things came to be in the end.<br />
<br />
But it's up to you, if it's requested, I can do a comprehensive summary of what exactly is going on in Hinamizawa, and why. You may also want this, and work your way backwards figuring out what happened to lead up to this finale.<br />
<br />
Just a few things to keep in mind before asking me for spoilers :) Higurashi is an incredible story and I don't want to spoil it for a person who doesn't realize the how massive a question they are asking.<br />
<br />
As to your questions,<br />
<br />
Dahne's Question 1 minor-medium spoilers:<br />
<br />
Yes, June gets replayed over and over so to speak. However, it's much more complicated than that. For more spoilers, continue... Furude Rika is at the center of these resets, it is her wish for a world where she and everyone can live on in happiness which causes the reset. At one time, it is assumed she could reset the world several years previous. But as time went on, she could only reset up to 2 weeks before the events of the tragedy.<br />
<br />
Question 2 Hint re: Oyashiro-sama<br />
<br />
Oyashiro-sama gets revealed in the 7th and 8th arcs. (which means, if you want me to talk more about Oyashiro-sama, it's a huge spoiler)<br />
<br />
Question 3 spoiler medium-high<br />
<br />
The parasite thing which makes people go insane is not a lie. It starts if you begin to doubt your friends. There are stages to this disease. They are not what Rena see it as, but rather a virus. For more read on..Stages are L1-L5. Basically, L1 is where you begin to doubt your friends and everyone around you. Around L3, you hear the footsteps of Oyashiro-sama following you around, thus driving you crazy. At L5, you go totally insane, which is what happens to Keiichi, Shion, and Rena.However, if it's the Great Hinamizawa Gas Disaster.. that's a 7th/8th arc spoiler.<br />
<br />
Questions RE: Tomitake/Takano Hint<br />
<br />
Takano is a large part of the 7th and 8th arcs. So any more detail about her that was not shown in the anime is going to be a massive spoiler. As is any questions about their deaths.<br />
<br />
And here are dangerous questions (for future reference) that spoil the 7th/8th arcs: (contained in the spoiler are just questions, not actual answers, but you may be able to deduce what's going on from these questions)<br />
<br />
What exactly is Oyashiro-sama?<br />
Who is Takano and what is her role in the series?<br />
What exactly happend in the Great Hinamizawa Disaster?<br />
(Alternately, why did Keiichi become the only one to survive it in one arc?)<br />
What's the truth about the Sonozaki family?<br />
<br />
<br />
Some clues on how to ask questions RE: what IS showin in the anime. Try and remember, or re-watch, events that caused people to get paranoid. Ask about those. (i.e. 6th arc event, but not spoiled)<br />
<br />
When those guys who were &quot;following&quot; Rena drove by and asked about Rena. And showed up at the school giving them an envlope which had a number that did not exist.<br />
<br />
Questions like these. I'll answer them as I get them.<br />
<br />
Well, that should cover it. Sorry for being too comprehensive, but I didn't want to potentionally ruin someone's enjoyment of the series. Please clearly label your spoilers (i.e. which arcs, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
eps 26.1+ TIP (Im not sure but i think this should have been originally shown after 26 ended)....I think this TIP is a good opener to the last two arcs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Summer 2005<br />
<br />
The tires of the car began to rattle as the road turned from asphalt to gravel. The incessant cries of the cicadas seeps through the shut windows.<br />
<br />
Most people would open their car windows and let the billowing natural air in along with the sounds of the cicadas. However, people also have become spoiled. They would rather keep themselves cool with the air conditioning turned to max rather than hearing the cicadas.<br />
<br />
Usually rains would begin to pour during this time of the year. But, June came along right into summer without any rain this year. ...I remember that the weather twenty years ago was also similar in which that June jumped right into summer as well.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;The air around this area is still clear as I remember it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Indeed it is. The winds and the sunshine here is nice. Perhaps if it had a chance, this place would've become a UNESCO World Heritage Site like the village in Gifu. What a waste...&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But thanks to that there are no irritating tourists around here. See, it makes it a much more smoother ride. ...Why do tourists forget about pedestrian traffic laws when they are in rural areas? Move over to the side, sheesh, I tell ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Ahahahaha. Akasaka-senpai, do you still do outdoor activities?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Not as much as I used to. There's not much free time in this job for that.&quot;<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Ahahahahaha. Same here. ....Oh hey, there he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The person I was supposed to meet with recognized me and waved his hand before I honked my horn. It was a young fellow on a motorcycle with a backpack on his shoulders. You can tell that he was prepared for a campout with his gears. Akasaka and his partner stepped outside of the car and shook hands with the young man.<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;It's nice to see you again, sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Yo. How's everything going on your end! Here, at ease. This is Akasaka-senpai. He took care of me back in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hello, my name is Akasaka. A man names Oishi was also supposed to come along today, but he had to undergo an emergency check-up and wasn't able to come. Anyhow, it's a pleasure to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;It's an honor sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;So, Akasaka-senpai, where shall we go first?&quot;<br />
<br />
His name is Akasaka Mamoru. He is a veteran police detective from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. By this time, he was already at a career level where he can see his retirement just a bit over the horizon. But, his sharp instincts and eyes have not retracted a single bit. His well-built muscular body and fearless aura against violent crimes can be well seen from the spectacular police duties he has built through experience.<br />
<br />
His connection to Hinamizawa goes back to almost thirty years. In 1978, he was in the Public Safety Division in the Metro Police Department. He first came to Hinamizawa back then while undergoing an investigation for the kidnapping of former Minister of Construction Inukai's grandson.<br />
<br />
There, he met Oishi and....Furude Rika. Furude Rika predicted the fate of her own death. ...Akasaka regrets to this day that he was unable to save such a little girl from her death. He learned of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster on TV and met up with Oishi soon thereafter. They pledged to uncover the mystery of the the cruel fate that fell upon the little girl and the serial murders of Hinamizawa. Unfortunately, Hinamizawa was off-limits to the people for a long time. As a result, the past twenty years for Akasaka and Oishi were painstaking. Their sole reliance were based on publishing what little information they've accumilated so far and the occasional tips and clues from former residents of that area. ...But the lockdown on Hinamizawa was finally lifted. However, they were unable to come to Hinamizawa immediately due to Akasaka's busy work schedule and Oishi's degrading health. In fact, Oishi was also supposed to come today as well, but he was called in for an emergency health check-up at his local hospital. Hence, Akasaka was the only one to come here today.<br />
<br />
The other two were Akasaka's juniors from his university. One was an officer in the Ground SDF and the other was his subordinate. The latter was involved during the lockdown phase of Hinamizawa and was quite knowledgeable of the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
Akasaka takes out a scrapbook from his bag. The sides were all dented and one can tell that this book was very old. Akasaka flipped through the pages, thought for a second, and told them their first stop.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Alright, please take me to the Onigafuchi Marsh first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;No problem. Right this way sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man propped up his bike and waited for the two to get back to their car. After honking their horns to signal that they were ready, they headed their way to the Onigafuchi Marsh...<br />
<br />
When the forest opened up, they came upon a very absurd area where the ground was sealed in heavy concrete. This was supposed to be where the marsh was, but there was not even a single drop of water in sight. All the water was replaced with concrete. ...This was how the current Onigafuchi Marsh looked like in the present day.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hahahaha. Not even a single drop of water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;I was told that they've sealed the marsh in the early stages right after the Great Disaster. This place was already covered in concrete by the time I arrived here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Let's go down there and take a closer look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka got off of his car and walked to the center of the concrete-filled marsh. This was not a parking lot nor a heliport. ...It was just a huge empty concrete space right in the middle of the forest.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;...So this is the place conspiracy theorist say that it is a landing spot for UFOs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;Really? I've never heard of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, that's what is written on occultish websites. They claim that this is the place where our government conduct meetings with aliens. But with such an empty concrete space like this in the middle of nowhere, I can't blame them for such rumors to be flying around.&quot;<br />
Young man &amp; Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahahaha.&quot;<br />
<br />
This marsh was the place where the volcanic gas erupted from back in June of 1983. The deadly mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide engulfed the entire town in the middle of the night and annihilated the residents of Hinamizawa in one night. The town was put into lockdown and the SDF in charge of this area sealed the marsh with concrete.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But the conspiracy theorists have some of their points which can't be dismissed as well. Any geologist would tell you that sealing off the site with concrete is absolutely useless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;Hmm...that's true. I've never heard of anyone trying to prevent a volcano from erupting by pouring concrete into it's volcanic crater. On the other hand, our country is known for doing weird construction jobs with tax payers' money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lately, websites dealing with the supernatural and UFOs has had a significant increase in the topics of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster. It is well known by now that the cause of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was due to deadly volcanic gases emerging from a magma chamber. In 1983, a similar natural disaster occurred in Lake Nyos, Cameroon. This showed that such a rare natural disaster can indeed occur anywhere on Earth.<br />
<br />
Recently however, rumors began to fly around here and there over the internet about another possible explanation. They say that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was just a government cover story and that the real cause was due to a biochemical terrorist attack by aliens. Why did such a rumor began to spread now...? Conspiracy theorists claim to back up their explanations from a secret document known as File No. 34. The name File No. 34 was given by someone posting on the internet message board, but the name stuck since the naming of the file sounded like a government conspiracy.<br />
<br />
It is not known how they obtained these documents. They posted scans and pictures of the documents, but what was written on it were ridiculous at best. Some added their own notes claiming it to be the real thing, so it is doubtful if such a document really does exist or not. But the contents of this File No. 34 is worth noting. However, since this stuff was posted on the internet, it should be taken for a grain of salt as most of the stuff is more like an urban legend.<br />
<br />
The File No. 34 was a notebook written by a nurse named Takano Miyo who worked at a local clinic in Hinamizawa. No. 34 was most likely named after her name. They say that this woman was also a researcher who sought to explain the local demon myths of the area. The contents of this notebook states that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster of 1983 was prophesized in advance.<br />
<br />
According to her research, she claims that an UFO crashed landed in Hinamizawa a long time ago and sunk into the Onigafuchi Marsh. The UFO had parasitic bacteria from space which began to infect the residents of the area. The infected villagers showed signs of extremely violent behaviors fit for the word &quot;demon.&quot; Takano Miyo insisted that this was the explanation to the myth about demons spurring out of the marsh. A lone alien who survived the crash realized that the earthlings were becoming erratic because of their intergalactic bacteria, and decided to show themselves to the villagers to help them out. ...This is the explanation of the appearance of the Oyashiro-sama. The alien was able to cure the villagers with highly advanced technology but was unable to eradicate it thoroughly. Since the villagers looked up to the alien as some sort of diety, the alien utilized its status to hand down specific rules to the villagers in order to contain the disease. The bacteria took a liking to Hinamizawa's habitat, so if the carrier of the disease left Hinamizawa, the symptoms came out again. Hence, the rule of not to leave the village was made. These all then lead to the hermit legends of the Onigafuchi Village. The weird practices and miracles that they performed were all due to the advanced technology that they received from the alien.<br />

<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahahaha. Those conspiracy theorists do indeed have a colorful perspective on things don't they? Remember that prophecy thing by Nostradamus? They all said that the world was gonna end in 1999, but nothing happened past July. All those TV shows built up the drama but it was just business as usual after that. Irresponsible I tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But, Takano Miyo did indeed seemed to have foreseen the Great Hinamizawa Disaster in advance. Look at this page on this scrapbook.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You must be joking. Ahahahaha.... ........Akasaka-senpai, is this for real...?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As time passed, the parasitic nature of the bacteria stabilized and became nothing more than a commensalistic symbiont in the human body. Aliens and the bacteria began to wither away from people's minds...However, it is claimed that the alien lived on for hundreds of years with the protection of the gosanke. It lives to this date underneath the secret lairs of the Furude Shrine. The alien was able to manipulate the bacteria living inside of the villagers body and was able to maintain control in the village all this time. The alien wanted to reclaim the power it once had and began to research how to bring re-awaken the long lost powers of the bacteria...etc. etc...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, things get much weirder from here. Cutting to the chase, the real reason for the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was that it was that the alien's was researching how to spread the re-awakened bacteria in a global scale in order to conquer Earth. The Japanese government had this secret government agency which dealt with such extraterrestrial matters, and they received special training from Area 51 in the United States....etc. etc... And this government agency moved in to stop this alien from it's plan to take over the world by locking down this village and killing off the residents of this area through the use of biological weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahaha! Hey, wasn't there a Hollywood movie that was similar to this? It was the one with the black guy as the lead character...what was the title...M.I. something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yeah I know. Reading this thing to gives me a headache. However, the write of this bunch of bull, Takano Miyo, was mysteriously murdered in June 1983. Right before her death, she gave these scrapbooks to one girl as if she knew that she was going to be killed very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That girl's name is &quot;Girl A.&quot; ....However, some fanatical mystery buffs proclaimed that they were able to track and narrow it down to a girl named &quot;Ryuguu Reina.&quot; Hence, it became known as the &quot;Ryuguu Reina Theory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryuguu Reina inherited Takano Miyo's intentions through her death. She tried to fight against the planned invasion by holding the school hostage and demanding the local police to uncover the alien's plot. Of course, no one believed her and it was assumed that she was in a state of paranoia. Back then, it was assumed that Ryuguu Reina was misdirected into believing Takano Miyo's mystery rants and unfortunately fell into a state of paranoia which lead to her aggressive action.<br />
<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;When she held the school hostage, Ryuguu Reina told the local police that the alien controlling the gosanke was plotting a massive bioterrorism in the near future. And the very next day, the Great Hinamizawa Disaster occurred.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You've gotta be kidding! Couldn't it be just some kind of coincidence?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;I don't know. According to conspiracy theorists, the immediate lockdown of the area by the SDF itself have inconsistencies here and there. Sealing off this marsh with concrete is just one example. And according to some of the SDF members who were involved in the lockdown at the time, they proclaim that they witnessed several people conducting some kind of secret research unrelated to geology. Of course, those who dismisses such accounts brushes these accounts as some sort of precautionary measures to keep unauthorized people off limits of the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;I'll have to agree with the people who dismisses these accounts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;And people also look at why it took such a long time for this lockdown to be finally be set open once again. In contrast, the lockdown of the Miyakejima Islands of Tokyo for their volcanic gases lasted only 4~5 years. The natural disaster that happened in Hinamizawa was one that was exceptionally rare, yet the lockdown lasted for over twenty years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;In Miyakejima Island, the residents strongly lobbied the government for their return to their home island. However, in the case of Hinamizawa, there were no residents alive who wished to return in the first place. Perhaps the government waited until they were absolutely certain that it was safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hmm. How about this one? The SDF members that were involved in the lockdown of Hinamizawa had there blood samples taken in the subsequent months. Some of these members were discharged without any explanation once some kind of result came in from those samples. Some of them believe that they were using the members of the SDF as a human test subjects to see if they would get infected or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;I think they were just checking up on the members' health since it was an area where the gas disaster occurred. Besides, normal corporate warriors also have their own annual physical check-ups too, and they take blood samples there as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yeah, I understand your statements too. But then, here's another interesting theory. There are some who proclaim that there was no deadly gas emitted during the so-called Great Hinamizawa Disaster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;No emission of volcanic gases? How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Basically, as stated, there was no volcanic gas. The gas disaster itself is a some sort of government coverup. It's like that movie made by Steven Spielberg. You know, the one where the humans make contact with UFOs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Now that's what I call a typical example of conspiracy theorists' way of explaining things. So, what kind of basis do they have to say that there was no emission of volcanic gas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, a bunch of conspiracy theorists and mystery buffs came to Hinamizawa as soon as the lockdown was lifted. According to them, the hydrogen sulfide in the volcanic gases should've caused some corrosion in metallic objects and have should've caused major damage to the surrounding wildlife. However, they found no such signs of such disruption, which they proclaim that there was no volcanic gas to begin with. ...But since this village was abandoned twenty years ago, I doubt that they would've found anything to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Hahaha. Well, there's the internet for you. Don't believe everything that's on it! ....Akasaka-senpai, please don't tell me you are buying into these things....are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;At first I had my doubts as well. But lately, I'm beginning to think that there might be some truths to some of these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You, believing in UFOs? Oh come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, what if this scrapbook is indeed the real File No. 34?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;This scrapbook was the one that was in Ryuguu Reina's posession at the time of the school hostage incident of June 25, 1983. It was assumed to be lost during the confusion of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster. However, Oishi's old friend was able to locate it in the evidence storage at the prefectural police headquarters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back then, even Oishi thought of the idea of aliens to be preposterious. ...But after reading this again after the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, some of these seem to hold vital clues.<br />
<br />
The alien part, we can probably disregard these as ********. But her theory of parasitic microbes causing the symptoms seen in Hinamizawa's past, also known as &quot;the Oyashiro-sama's Curse&quot; is a bit intriguing. Of course, there is no proof that such microbes exist, so this still remains at the theoretical level.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;According to Oishi, he says that the gosanke were trying to bring back the old traditions to Hinamizawa. They were researching how to bring back an old but deadly microbe in order to uphold their power. And perhaps that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was an experiment that went wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course there are also information from the internet cannot be dismissed as just a theory or a myth. For example, the mysterious death of the village clinic's head doctor. And the mystery of Furude Rika's gruesomely mutilated corpse...<br />
<br />
There was an underground research lab beneath the village clinic where Dr. Irie was forced to do microolgical research, but he gave into his own misdeeds and committed suicide. ...Furude Rika is thought to have been brutally murdered as a sacrifice for some sort of ritual ceremony.<br />
<br />
However, their experiment went wrong. ...Instead of the microbes becoming the parasites of the villagers, they became killer viruses. And so that is how the village virtually became extinct in one night...<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;For one thing, at least we know that this was just not a gas disaster. We cannot disregard the fact that right before the disaster, one girl did say that a bio-terrorism would occur. There's also the fact that Ms. Takano Miyo made the scrapbook as well. If the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was an unprecedented and unforeseen natural disaster, then the existence of these two are quite extraordinary. And upon reading this File No. 34 there are things written here that shouldn;t be just shoved off to the side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;So...the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was not a rare natural occurrence, but was in fact a bio-terrorist act by some cultists?&quot;<br />
<br />
In the Heisei era, everyone in Japan knew about the shocking news where a doomsday cult group had researched making sarin nerve gas and unleashed its deadly domestic terrorist acts. But in the Showa era, the idea of a single cult group being able to carry out such a terrorist act would've been scoffed at, moreso it would've never crossed the minds of anyone to start with.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Some also say that the long lockdown by the SDF is actually a long research effort to uncover that killer virus...but I have my own doubts here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Hahahaha. Well, at least this story sounds more credible compared to aliens and UFOs. The idea of cultists and domestic terrorism is sounds more rational in our day and age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Or perhaps maybe there really was an UFO. ...When Ryuguu Reina was taking the school hostage, one of her demands to the police was to have them pull out the wreckage of the UFO from the Onigafuchi Marsh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Whatever...&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, you can say 'whatever,' but look. We're standing on the marsh itself right now, and there is no way for us to check if there is any since it is all enclosed in concrete several meters thick. This is all due to a construction effort in which numerous geologist say that it is a futile attempt to contain volcanic gas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Well then, the only way to prove Akasaka-senpai's theory is to find a single survivor of Hinamizawa and try to uncover if that person has that microbe in him or her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Sadly, that is more difficult than ever. After the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, there was a massive witch-hunt scare of people from Hinamizawa (see: burakumin). People from this area are quite mum and do not wish to disclose where they came from.<br />
<br />
Right after the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, there were numerous reports of people who were from the Hinamizawa area that began to show erratic behavior. When these people began to show eccentricities and began to commit suicide in strange ways, there was a massive scare within Japan for people from Hinamizawa and began outcasted former residents of that area in a sort of social witch-hunt. The government was practically useless in protecting privacy at the time, so the former residents of Hinamizawa began to hide their background to prevent their own backlash. (see the manga Onisarashi-hen)<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Then it's a dead end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yet as a cop, it is my duty to never give up. ...There's just too much evidence that points that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was not just a natural disaster. If I can just grab a hold of one vital evidence, just one, I think I can start reeling in the truth behind all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Yeah, but it has been over twenty years ago. The truth might be laying somewhere very deep within the darkness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;That's true. ...Even as I now stand here in the 21st century, but I don't think I'm going to find any answers here.&quot;<br />
<br />
What happened in Hinamizawa, June of 1983?<br />
<br />
The only factual evidence that I have is that Ms. Takano Miyo mysteriously died and she left behind a scrapbook proclaiming that a bio-terrorist attach would occur. A young girl took a school hostage shortly thereafter proclaiming the &quot;prophecy,&quot; but no one took it seriously. The head village doctor committed suicide. The little girl whom the villagers revered as a reincarnation of the Oyashiro-sama, Furude Rika, was found gruesomely mutilated.<br />
<br />
What is the truth behind this scrapbook? Do the contents of this scrapbook really list the attempt to unravel a huge conspiracy? Or is this just some ramblings of an eccentric mystery buff as it was brushed off back then?<br />
<br />
If this scrapbook is true, this all would've been averted by just listening to the heeds of one girl. If this is all false, then who created this disaster like a pre-meditated scenario?<br />
<br />
After that infamous sarin nerve gas incident, the terminology known as &quot;mind control&quot; which was used by the cultists came into the spotlight. In contrast to &quot;brainwashing&quot; which is a short-term effect which forces a person to commit certain acts, &quot;mind control&quot; is a long-term form which is induced upon the victim over a course of time. Over time, the victim begins to believe that what he or she must do is right and acts upon it as his or her own act. It is a form of character altercation which is far more serious than brainwashing.<br />
<br />
The cultists induced fear and anxiety to its members through revelations of doomsday. At the same time, they are also given ways and means to salvation, which began to penetrate within them into obedience on their own recourse.<br />
<br />
This above said formula is quite similar to how Ryuguu Reina became a puppet of the File No. 34. Then would that mean that Ryuguu Reina was a victim by someone who &quot;mind controlled&quot; her? And did some cultists who tried to manipulate her with mind control also try to instigate doomsday on their own to authenticate their own cause? Would that mean that this File No. 34 is some sort of religious text for such a cult?<br />
<br />
As I fall deeper in deciphering what is real and what is not...I reset my mind to figure out if there is anyone might be laughing in amusement at this disaster. If taken that into mind, then this scrapbook is a script. It's a stage script which plays out a tragedy in which several thousand villages loses their lives in one night. It's a demon's script where they observers laugh at the deaths of human lives.<br />
<br />
Who the hell wrote this script? And who the hell performed this? Someone was laughing while it played out.<br />
<br />
Damn it...!! ...What the hell happened in Hinamizawa, June of 1983!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I see...  Then, are all the answers given in the anime, and it's just left to the viewer to decipher them?  I know I'll have to watch it all over again to have any hope of figuring it out, heh, but I don't want to drive myself crazy trying to figure it out if I'm working without some crucial information.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help that I'm not quite sure of the mechanics of the whole doujinshi game thing.  Are these TIPS something from that?  Do you guys know all this stuff because you've played the whole thing in Japanese?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, you will never figure out the true mystery from the anime alone. The anime only gave like 25% of the availble information. You could figure out the mystery to some extent from the anime alone, but you'll figure it out up to what has been revealed in the 6th chapter. The two final, and biggest clues to the mystery get revealed in the 7th and 8th chapters.<br />
<br />
So yes, there are crucial information missing from the series. It subtly hints at a lot of things, but without further reinforcement of the info, it means nothing by itself.<br />
<br />
In the game, which is a sound novel (in the sense that music is 40% of the experience), you just read it like a novel. As key mysteries get revealed, a TIPS gets unlocked. The TIPS often include more detailed information, but is also often nothing or a delibrate misdirection. It is up to the reader to figure out what is real and what is not.<br />
<br />
I played the game, yeah, or rather, struggled through it. Sollon has asked me alot of spoilerific questions, so he knows a bit, though I still haven't told him the final two pieces of the puzzle about the 7th/8th arcs either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">10-09-06, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, damn.  In any case, here's a couple crackpot theories:<br />
<br />
The paranoia seems to always begin with Tomitake, Takano, and then Ooishi.  Could they actually be agents of whatever (or whoever) it is that makes people go insane?<br />
<br />
The swamp being the breeding grounds for a parasite the cultists wanted to use... really adds another layer to the whole Dam War thing :) Could they have been expiramenting with gasses in the swamp, and accidently caused the explosion?</div></div><hr />

Are there any drugs that induces suicide? (Ep. 03)<br />
<br />
 Oishi: &quot;Are there any drugs that causes a person to commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
Forensics Doctor: &quot;Directly, no&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;The way you say it seems like there is an indirect way, then&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;I meant to say, there is a way to cause a psychological effect that triggers a person to commit suicide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Hmm...that's even a more difficult way of saying it. Can you explain the meaning of 'causing a psychological effect that trigger's a person to commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Okay, let's take a person that has bipolar disorder. A person with bipolar disorder is most likely to commit suicide at the point where his or her mental state switches from depression to mania.&quot;<br />
<br />
The main difference from bipolar disorder to an unipolar disorder is that the former has an active and energized state in addition that kicks in interchangeably with depression.<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;If a patient is in the depressed state, he or she does not have the mental will to commit suicide. On the other hand, if the patient is in the hyper-active state, he or she will also not commit suicide as they are living an active life.<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;That's interesting. A bipolar person won't commit suicide in both states, yet they are most likely to at the stage where they change from the depression state to energetic state?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;When a patient is in depression, he or she has suicidal tendencies in their minds. But, they have no will to carry out the suicide since they are in major depression. However, as soon as the transition to the energetic state begins to kick in, they start to become active once again...&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Oh, now I get it! They start to have the active will to carry out the suicide!&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;That's exactly right. So that is why it is imperative to give patients anticonvulsants during this phase.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;So did Mr. Tomitake have bipolar disorder?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Bipolar suicidal tendencies involve more normal suicides like jumping off a building or hanging oneself, not like an withdrawal symptom of scratching one's throat. That's sounds like an illegal substance to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Yes, Mr. Tomitake's suicide was quite unusual. So some kind of substance was used for his death. Can you explain the first one...the one about the drug that can cause a psychological effect that triggers suicidal tendencies?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Methamphetamines are known to cause symtoms very similar to bipolar disorder. These are known in the streets as crystal meth. Some barbiturates also show signs of psychotic hyperactivity, but this is less common. This one is more known for helping people with insomnia - sleeping pills. &quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Strangely, the coroner's report did not show any signs of substances.. Any other possibilities?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;If you scratch off illegal substances off the list, then all I can think of is a disease. One suspect in this case is Graves-Basedow Disease, whose hyperthyroidism is reported to cause effects similar to bipolar disorder. However, in the case of Graves-Basedow Disease, there are many visual signs in a patient. The deceased didn't have those symptoms so that scratches off this disease from the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Are there any ones that break out more suddenly? How can I say...like ones that matches the deceased suicide in a more unexpected and sudden manner?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;How about acute organic psychosis? To say it bluntly, a person's brain gets damaged and becomes psychotic. While this can be caused by side-effects of illegal substances, it can also happen when brain damage occurs due to tumors or direct damage to the cranial area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;So there is a possibility of inducing a person's psychosis without reliance of substances?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;You said the deceased was surrounded by several assailants, right? The deceased may have had an adrenaline rush compounded by a severe strike to the cranial area which may have induced his psychotic abnormality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Can you say that in more simpler terms?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Kakakaka (a laughter from a more older person). I'm saying the man got hit in the head as he was fighting off his assailants and his mind got ****** up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Hahaha! So what you're saying is that the assailant(s) didn't have any motive to kill him! All they wanted to do was extort some money off the guy, but they hit him on the wrong side of the head!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two fat middle-aged men laughs.<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;....of course that can't be the reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Ahem. Indeed. Whether by illegal substance or by psychological symptoms, the deceased body itself holds the key to the clue. How's that going along?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Oh ****, it's this time already? I'd better get going or Kuma-chan (Oishi's partner) will start to get pissed off.&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Okay. Take care! Have a nice year!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;You too. Have a nice year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scrapbook II (Ep. 06)<br />
<br />
 &lt;The Sacrifice Ritual&gt;<br />
<br />
The Sacrifice Ritual was carried out very simply: by drowning. The victim was drowned into the scared site called the Onigafuchi Marsh.<br />
<br />
One of the most unique aspects is that in Onigafuchi village, the victim was slowly drowned into the marsh over the course of three days and three nights. This was perhaps because the point of the ritual was not to &quot;kill,&quot; but was a pun to &quot;put down.&quot; (&quot;put down&quot; meaning to putting the victim down into the marsh and to putting down/quelling the evil spirits)<br />
<br />
Considering this theory, there must've been many methods and ideas that were conceived to slow the drowning of the victim into the marsh. Unfortunately, no record exists on what kinds of methods were used for that ritual.<br />
<br />
My theory is that they used a log as a mini-boat and used it as an altar, tied the victim up with ropes, and slowly lowered the victim down into the marsh according to the day of the time. However, if that was the case, such contraptions must be safely stored somewhere as a &quot;saigu.&quot; (&quot;saigu&quot; literally means &quot;festivity item.&quot; This term will come up over an over again, so it will be much easier to remember this terminology)<br />

Scrapbook III (Ep. 06)<br />
<br />
&lt;Saigus used at the rituals&gt;<br />
<br />
The ritual equipments used are known as &quot;saigu,&quot; and are safely locked away at the Furude Shrine and in the storages of the other gosanke.<br />
<br />
However, these &quot;saigu&quot; are all of contemporary form and none of them reveal the true nature of the dark history of the Onigafuchi village. Had these been lost along with the rituals when the era changed from the end of the Edo period to Meiji? I do not believe so. I sternly believe that the real &quot;saigus&quot; used during the nights of Onikakushi and sacrificial rituals still exist. They exist right here and now, at somewhere in this village of Hinamizawa.<br />
<br />
I have 90% certainty where they might be stored. For some reason starting from this year, the place that I suspect stores these items have been changed from a tightly secured lock to a simple padlock. I'm pretty sure that such a cheap lock can be picked open very easily by that man.<br />
<br />
However, the village meetings are held very close to that location with high human activity. But I do not give up. The night where all of Hinamizawa will be attending is approaching. That is the prime time to go under the darkness as a blindspot.<br />
<br />
It's almost the time for Watanagashi.<br />

Scrapbook VII (Ep. 06)<br />
<br />
&lt;The gosanke&gt;<br />
<br />
The gosanke signifies the three most powerful families that controlled matters in Onigafuchi village.<br />
<br />
These three are the Kimiyoshi Family, the Furude Family, and the Sonozaki Family. All three exist to this present day. (Even though they do not wield that much power as historically written, they still weigh tremendous influence within the region to this day). The gosanke are said to have inherited the highest concentration of the demons' blood in their bloodline.<br />
<br />
&lt;The Kimiyoshi Family&gt;<br />
Formerly, the Kimiyoshi Family was the strongest and held the leadership position within the gosanke. However, it seems that they have lost influence in the present time.<br />
<br />
The current village chief (Kimiyoshi Kiichirou) is a member of this family. It is believed that this is the reason why the Kimiyoshi family always held the position of the village chief before the idea of elections were introduced. Of course, since there are no other candidates, there hasn't been any change for the Kimiyoshi family being the head of the village even in our post-war era.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;The Furude Family&gt;<br />
They have been the center of faith, and they are responsible for the preservation of the shrine to respect the Oyashiro-sama. They have been revered as the spokesperson for the voice of Oyashiro-sama. However many of their branches had died off during the war, and only the main branch of their household exist today. Furthermore, the only living person of this family is a single female child (Furude Rika), and it is in danger of going into extinction.<br />
<br />
There seems to be custom of especially revering the female member of the Furude line, so many of the elderly villagers take a huge reverance to Rika.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;The Sonozaki Family&gt;<br />
They are believed to be the enforcers of the practice and customs for Onigafuchi village. They were among the weakest of the gosanke, and were always the last to be addressed. However, it is interesting to note that this power balance has shifted in the present times as they wield the largest influence within all of the gosanke. It is safe to say that they now control all the matters and decisions of Hinamizawa.<br />
<br />
The three gosanke must agree upon a matter to take action, but this is just in practice only. In reality, all the decisions are handled by the current head of the family, Sonozaki Oryou.<br />
<br />
Scrapbook VIII (Ep. 07)<br />
<br />
&lt;The gosanke in the present day&gt;<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, the current gosanke meetings are in name only as the dictatorial powers are vested by the Sonozaki family. The Kimiyoshi and the Furude families had not retained the strengths that they used to have, nor do they seem to have the desire to hold onto to their ancestors' traditions.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the Sonozaki family has held a firm grasp onto their beliefs, traditions, and power to this date. It is assumed that the most recent &quot;Watanagashi&quot; incident reported back in the end of the Meiji era was also under the supervision of the Sonozaki family head at that time. (see family tree of the gosanke families at the end of Meiji era) The Sonozaki family gained further influence in Hinamizawa as they took the leadership role of helping its economy.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, while the chairman for the group against the dam contruction project several years ago was lead by the Kimiyoshi family, it known that the Sonozaki family were the real leaders in this massive demonstration. As the Kimiyoshi family fought against the project through legal and civil means, it is rumored that the Sonozaki family aided the anti-dam construction effort through dark and shady methods. Most of Hinamizawa do not doubt that the numerous subversive activities during the anti-contruction demonstrations were carried out by the Sonozakis. For example, one of the most well known incident that many believe that the Sonozakis were behind it was the kidnapping and extortion of the Minister of Contruction's grandson.<br />
<br />
Henceforth, it is touted that the recent murder-homicides were executed by the Sonozaki family. These murder-homicides symbolizes a revival of the old &quot;Watanagashi&quot; festival. Perhaps they are trying to make the villagers remember the rules and traditions of the old Onigafuchi village by carrying out these &quot;watanagashis&quot; on the day of the Watanagashi Festival?<br />
<br />
More research on the Sonozaki family will be necessary to complete the research on this subject. Should entering the Furude Shrine's warehouse be successful, I shall focus my next attention towards the Sonozaki family. Although the security around the Sonozaki household complex is very secure with surveillance cameras and the like, I am fortunate enough to know members of the Sonozoki family, the heiress Mion and her twin sister Shion. I would like to utilize this connection to further my research.<br />

Copy of Initial Autopsy Report (Ep. 09)<br />
<br />
 According to the autopy report, the victim was murdered in the following manner:<br />
<br />
<br />
(1) Full body was strapped by a restraining device<br />
Upon inspection of the bruises on the body, it seems that the entire body was put onto specialized restraining device. The bruises on her fingers stand out so it is highly possible that this device was of a custom or home made device.<br />
<br />
<br />
(2) Both ears and nose cut off by a sharpened object<br />
Due to the different types of bruises, it is surmised that there was one or more persons to hold her down on the victim's neck as the facial parts were cut off. It is possible that more than one object were used, and one of those objects have a high possibility of being a scissor.<br />
<br />
<br />
(3) Nails driven through the fingers of both hands<br />
Both of the victims hands had one nail driven through each of the finger joints; totalling 30 nails. The body was found with the nail-driven hands strapped to a wooden board about 20 square centimeters. This board has a high possibility of being a part of the restraining device. And it is a highly suspected that this device was built for this exact purpose.<br />
<br />
<br />
(4) Stomach cut open, intestines torn out<br />
It is possible that the stomach was cut open with a sharp object like a medical surgery. There is no doubt that the victim was still alive at this point. The intestines and internal organs were then pulled and torn out. This was the main cause of death of the victim.<br />
<br />
<br />
(5) Corpse abandonment<br />
Dumbbells were tied to the pet collar and was strapped to the victim's neck. The body was then abandoned into the third channel of Tamagokawa River. By taking into account of the weights of the dumbbells, three men would've been necessary to abandon the body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To Oishi-san:<br />
<br />
This is the copy of the initial autopsy report that you requested for the Tamagokawa Corpse Mutilation case. Section Chief Shigeharu says that this could be related to Type-S cases. What do you think, Oishi-san?<br />
<br />
Research Note II (Ep. 13)<br />
<br />
&lt;About the Oyashiro-sama&gt;<br />
<br />
It is not known how the word Oyashiro-sama is spelled. However, this may also be the result of how the translation of its name had changed subtlely over the course of history. Hence, it is quite difficult to find whether or not this name is indeed correct to begin with.<br />
<br />
In fact, the the only thing that is common in its history is that the readability of the four words O-YA-SHI-RO.<br />
<br />
One theory states that the &quot;&#31038;&quot; (see footnote 1) that houses the Oyashiro-sama itself became a subject of worship, and that is why it became to be known as &quot;&#24481;&#31038;&#12373;&#12414;&quot; (see footnote 2). However, this theory is rather bland and boring.<br />
<br />
While the following information may or may not be related to the above said matter, it is said that the noble Furude family has the bloodline of the Oyashiro-sama flowing within them. And according to the Furude family legend, it is said that if the first child that is born is a female after eight generations, that daughter in the eight generation will be the reincarnation of the Oyashiro-sama itself.<br />
<br />
If one takes this legend into consideration, it seems the correct way to spell Oyashiro-sama is &quot;&#24481;&#20843;&#20195;&#12373;&#12414;&quot; (see footnote 3). (Of course, this spelling is just my own theory so there is no way of knowing for sure).<br />
<br />
If such is the case, then the naming of the Oyashiro-sama is made under the premise of resurrection. Worshiping a deity under the pretense of its resurrection can be seen in many religions, so this is not rare. However, it is also interesting to note that several religions associate the resurrection of their deity with the &quot;apocalypse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Furude Rika, the cute little girl where all the village elders seem to take care of her with special treatment. ...There are rumors that she is the eighth generation &quot;Oyashiro-sama.&quot; While I do not known the precise details of the Furude family tree, I do know that the first child of the past two generations were female.<br />
<br />
Furude Rika, the little girl who looks over to protect Hinamizawa. What would happen if Hinamizawa loses her divine protection? What would happen if the tranquility between the humans and the demons were to wither away? Would all hell break loose once again as human-eating demons begin to engulf the village?<br />
<br />
Weak and powerless humans cry and scream as the demons feast and remember what it was like to be their former selves.<br />
<br />
...I wonder what a spectacle that would be. My heart pounds in excitement just imagining what it would be like.<br />
<br />
The Great Hinamizawa Disaster (Epilogue Ep. 13)<br />
<br />
Early dawn June 22, 1983<br />
<br />
XX Prefecture, Shishibone County, Hinamizawa village  a wide spread disaster has occurred.<br />
&#12288;<br />
From one of the Hinamizawa districts water sources, Onigafuchi Swamp, has emitted volcanic gases (hydrogen sulphide &amp; carbon dioxide) that shrouded the entire village.<br />
<br />
&#12288;Over 1,200 victims confirmed.<br />
<br />
&#12288;Over 20 people reported missing.<br />
<br />
Approximately 600,000 people were evacuated from the surrounding communities, making this an unprecedented catastrophe.<br />
<br />
Later investigations showed that directly under Onigafuchi Swamp, there was a magma reservoir and hot springs;<br />
<br />
Leading to the conclusion the erupted gases causing this disaster originated from here.<br />
<br />
In addition, immediately after the disasters occurrence, one after another people claimed the disaster as the Curse in accordance to Hinamizawa folklore stirring early confusion.<br />
<br />
In Hinamizawa, when a curse is set, noxious gas said to erupt and wipe out the village accordance to folklore;<br />
<br />
Leading scholars to believe in the past a similar gas eruption happened and has remained as folklore.<br />
<br />
One particular fanatical weekly magazine reports, that this is a mere extension to the bizarre deaths which has spanned the past several years in Hinamizawa village, aggregating it as the Oyashiro-sama Curse Theory.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the relatives of the Hinamizawa citizens who escaped the disaster complained of failing physical health and were hospitalized one after another following the disaster;<br />
<br />
Among a portion of them, past away from an unknown disease, further escalating the chaos.<br />
<br />
On top of that, few of the relatives self proclaimed they were possessed by Oyashiro-samas Curse and committed suicide in such outrageous ways,<br />
<br />
...there was no longer any way to stop the wide-spread shock over the nation.<br />
<br />
The delusion of poisonous gas seeping in the dead of night silently, sparked fear across the entire Japanese nation;<br />
<br />
Resulting increasing complaints of sleeplessness, troubled breathing, headaches, dizziness, etc.<br />
<br />
Amongst them, few proclaimed they were possessed, and committed to odd behaviors.<br />
<br />
This is likely due to subjective influence from radical information, however,<br />
<br />
...later, this mental distress caused by the Hinamizawa Catastrophe elevated to an epidemic dubbing this condition as the Hinamizawa Syndrome...<br />
<br />
Targeted by various rumors and speculations, presently the Hinamizawa district has been restricted and even flight over the area has been prohibited.<br />
<br />
As the gases level dropped, and the restriction was lifted, however, in the Fall of the same year once more a gas outbreak was confirmed, and the surrounding area was again restricted.<br />
<br />
Local stories tell the rotting village still has the remains of civilization, as if in a coma sleeping continuously...<br />
<br />
In the end there was a lone survivor, a male living at Hinamizawa XXXX block, Maebara Keiichi (1X).<br />
<br />
At the time of rescue, he had trouble breathing suffering from pulmonary edema due to the gasses, however, from grave rescue efforts his life been saved.<br />
<br />
Presently he is hospitalized in the general hospital within the prefecture.&#12288;<br />
<br />
Several reporters have tried pursing for an interview daily, but all were refused.<br />
<br />
......What did he see at Hinamizawa?<br />
<br />
From 6/21 to 6/22, what happen in Hinamizawa?<br />
<br />
Even to this day, he has continued to keep his silence.<br />

Box Selection Game (Ep. 14)<br />
<br />
Do you think there is such a thing as choices in life?<br />
There are a lot of people who lament.<br />
They say &quot;if clear choices were set up at various turnpoints in my life, then I would've been able to gauge them carefully, and guide myself to a better future.&quot;<br />
<br />
...Whenever I hear lamentations like that, I would think &quot;what a pointless worry&quot;.<br />
Even if we were given choices to select from, it won't have any meanings anyway, nor does that help us guide ourselves to a better future.<br />
<br />
......You don't understand?<br />
Well then, as an example, let's put two odd-looking boxes in front of you.<br />
<br />
And then, let's say you are now given two choices.<br />
That is, do you open the red box? Or do you open the blue box?<br />
<br />
You would probably be indecisive, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;If I have to open one, be it red or blue, I would want to open the one that's better for me&quot;, it's a very natural desire to wish for that.<br />
And then, after considering various factors such as the boxes' shape and feel, and after much contemplation, you would finally pick one of the boxes.<br />
<br />
.........Which box would you pick?<br />
<br />
Red and blue.<br />
...If we were to follow the rules of the traffic signals, then red means danger.<br />
But that doesn't mean blue would guarantee safety either.<br />
Who knows, it might actually be a trap to make you feel cautious about the red box, so that you would open the blue box.<br />
<br />
Trap?<br />
...Is it possible that the contents within the boxes are not gains, but actually something that causes a loss instead...?<br />
<br />
Now then... you're becoming more and more indecisive now.<br />
Torn between the choice of red and blue, ...you must be beginning to hope for a choice to leave this place without opening any boxes at all.<br />
<br />
But nope. You must open one of the boxes.<br />
Ah, I almost forgot to mention this, but once you pick a box, the other box will disappear.<br />
So you'll have no way of knowing what was in the box that you didn't pick. Just to let you know that we have this rule, okay?<br />
<br />
Now then. Want to take your pick?<br />
The red box? Or the blue box?<br />
