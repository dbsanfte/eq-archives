Today I put an order in for a dedicated web server for The Safehouse.<br>The current server we are on has a few issues that just became known to us. The biggest one being that the server is designed to only allow 20 simultaneous processes.<br>What that means in layman&#8217;s terms is that only 20 requests for any single item (page, graphic, database query) can take place at any given time. This is causing the lag issues we are currently dealing with. (Anyone who reads Lum the Mad may also be aware that he is experiencing the identical problem, this is because we have the same solution from the same service provider.)<br><br>The new server is completely dedicated to my hosting company and the Safehouse. The performance WILL increase, this I promise. This will also allow us to do many more things we have wanted to do.<br><br>The time frame for this to take place will be over the next couple of weeks. The new server will be available to me no later than Monday, then im estimating at least a week for setup and cutover form the old site.<br><br>The Safehouse staff asks that you bear with us while we make the move over.<br><br>Thank you all,<br><br>Aidden &<br>The Safehouse Staff.<br></font></blockquote><hr noshade color="000000" align="left" width="50%">

As you can already see the look and feel are dramatically different.<br><br>Many new features abound, and we invite you to look around. Some of the items of note are the resource page now provides you access to our very own Armor and weapons database dedicated to just Rogue items. We will be accepting Screenshots of in game activity and will be posting them on a weekly if not daily basis, depending on the number received.<br><br>You will notice a new "Shop" section where you can now buy a few Safehouse items made by Cafepress.  Our friends at RPGWear.com are busy right now putting together our Black Tshirts and they should be available soon.<br><br>The site is still being developed and will always be changing slightly so watch for new features. A few of the pages are still being filled with content and will seem a bit sparse for the first few weeks. Please bare with us in this area. <br><br>The future promises more in depth coverage of the EQ world with interviews and weekly columns.<br><br>There is a chance, with the vast amount of content the Safehouse contains, that we might of missed some minor errors. Please forward any errors or bugs to Admin@thesafehouse.org and we will repair them as soon as we can.<br><br>Special thanks to Titons for all the time she devoted to inputting items into the database.<br><br>Thank you all for you Support of The Safehouse, and enjoy your ride.<br><br>~The Safehouse Staff</font></blockquote><hr noshade color="000000" align="left" width="50%">
