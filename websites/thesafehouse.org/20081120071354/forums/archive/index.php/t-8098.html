<br />
Master Sketch is a re-useable poison component used for several 1st-tier and 2nd-tier poisons.<br />
<br />
<br />
GMAVial is discussed here: www.eqtraders.com/secrets...ophies.htm<br />
Basically it's an Artisan's Seal combined with a Sealed Vial in Mortar &amp;amp; Pestle.<br />
<br />
GMASeal requires GMAV, Eyerazzia and the following 8 old-world poisons: Mage's Bane, Soul Burn, Susceptible Essence, Spirit of Sloth, Warlord's Rage, Rending Swiftness, Twisting Disorientation, Iron Dimethy <br />
GMASeal produces Coffin Bottles, which are NO DROP LORE 10-slot containers than are used to make 5-charge and 10-charge poisons. The Coffin Bottle is used up in this combine, it will disappear (but you can always summon new ones).<br />
A Coffin Bottle is used to get on of the 4 sketches for the Master Sketch. Veteran ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

<br />
I will confirm that a MQ is possible. Back in the early days of Norrath I played a Rogue named Kineda to lvl 40 and did not continue on with his progess. I did however do the burning rapier quest because at the time it was very good.<br />
<br />
Years later I made another Rogue, my current rogue Saphe. I did not to the BR quest with Saphe because in my eyes there was no point to. <br />
<br />
Saphe Assassinated Lon the Redemmed yesterday and I used Kineda (different account) to supply the Burning Rapier and it worked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jettas</div><div class="date">11-02-02, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some info I would share that I have found ...<br />
<br />
Lon the Redeemed has a respawn time of about 6 hours (so I heard). He was not up when I first went calling but was later the next day when I came back. Has a lot of hit points for his level so if you do not get assassinate right out either have a good healer close by, or try to bring him to zone away from healers (no mobs assist him) and try to Instill Doubt and get your assassinate in that way.<br />
<br />
Expin has 2 times when he despawns/respawns. He follows a similar pattern to Tani in that he despawns and pretty much instantly repops at 7pm and 9pm game time. Note that he did not despawn exactly at the stroke of 7pm, more like 730pm so be patient. I got my piece of paper from him during this short window of opportunity but he may very well it other times as well.<br />
<br />
I hope this is not too much information to be considered necessary to be moved to the Back Alley. I just wanted to pass it along to others persuing this quest. I certainly hope they make shrieking ahlspeisses more common now ... I can only think of about 3 I have seen drop in all my trips up there on my way to level 60. I have a feeling I am going to be stuck on this step for a long long time. =^(<br />

If she did, then you have a case to petition and should be able to get it back. Write up an online petition, wait a few days and you may get lucky. If you just walked up to her and blindly gave it without going through the dialog, then your screwed. Patofnaud  (raid gear)<br />

<br />
Like it was mentioned above, Expin follows the same pattern as Tani, he will pop and depop like 4 or 5 times starting around 8pm game time. <br />
<br />
I picked him through severel cycles and finally picked &quot;a crumpled letter&quot; or something like that.  I thought I had the item that I came for....the problem is that it identifies as &quot;a crumpled letter&quot; and is lore, but is NOT no drop.  So this obviously isn't the thing I need.<br />
<br />
Am I suppose to do something with this letter to get the sketch piece or am I suppose to pick the sketch from him.  If I'm suppose to pick the sketch and not this letter.....wth is the letter? <br />

[Tue Nov 05 22:47:41 2002] Renux Herkanor regards you as an ally -- she appears to be quite formidable.<br />

[Tue Nov 05 22:47:44 2002] Renux Herkanor peers at you, looking you up and down 'Greetings Mizchif.  I wish you could help me, but you look like you lack the knowledge to perform the tasks I require.  Come back when you are ready.'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:47:52 2002] You say, 'what tasks?'<br />
***I decide to check how she likes me sneaked and behind her***<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:00 2002] You begin to sneak...<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:00 2002] You are as quiet as a cat stalking its prey.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:02 2002] Renux Herkanor regards you indifferently -- she appears to be quite formidable.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:04 2002] You say, 'Hail, Renux Herkanor'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:04 2002] Renux Herkanor peers at you, looking you up and down 'Greetings Mizchif.  I wish you could help me, but you look like you lack the knowledge to perform the tasks I require.  Come back when you are ready.'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:29 2002] You stop sneaking.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:47 2002] You say, 'I will help you replace all that was lost'<br />
^^^ This is the phrase from the earlier step to cause her to give you the combo-box<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:47 2002] Renux Herkanor says 'I told you Mizchif!  I wish you could help me, but you lack the skill to perform the tasks I require.  Come back when you are ready!'<br />
^^^ This is downright misleading! But, while not sneaking, I did the hand-in here (with fingers crossed)***<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Renux Herkanor says 'Great! Looks like everything is here!  Hopefully Master Hanns won't send me to Steamfont now, I have a really bad feeling about that assignment.  Here take this Seal, it was dropped by that dark stranger.  It glows with a dark power I just don't understand.  Be wary of further sightings of that dark assassin.'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Circle Of Unseen Hands got better.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Merchants of Qeynos got worse.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Corrupt Qeynos Guards got better.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos got worse.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Kane Bayle got better.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
I wonder if some of the people who report having lost their turn-in box (after combine) were sneaking and behind her, and hence were conning indif instead of ally to her?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rune the Borrower</div><div class="date">11-06-02, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I did not speak to her. I went up to her and handed her the combined box. I was NOT sneaking or hidden.<br />
<br />
After several days I finally got an email saying that I had done the quest wrong BUT as a one time deal (I guess out of the goodness of his heart) they would return the box to me.<br />
<br />
When I logged on I had the box. Due to Patofnaud's post and the text of the email I received I assumed that I had missed some step. I hurried out to WKar to meet the wench and get to the bottom of things.<br />
<br />
I again conned her, still ally. I hailed her. Her response was that she wished I could help her but she could see that I did not have the knowledge to do so.<br />
<br />
Telling her that I would retrieve what was lost caused her to say that I did not have the skill. As you can see, both responses are mirrored in Mizchif's logs.<br />
<br />
At this point I was wondering what was really wrong.<br />
<br />
I tried equipping the box in my ranged slot and then tried holding it. Nothing there.<br />
<br />
I began pestering all the 59-65 rogues I could find.<br />
/tell random rogue_04 &quot;Have you completed the GMAS quest yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Random rogue_04 tells you, &quot;What is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally I found on who had. &quot;What did you do when you turned the box in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I walked up, unhid, conned ally and handed her the box.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, that sounds just like what I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Really flustered now, I was vacillitating between just handing her the box and logging to post here and ask advice and waiting until tomorrow to do the turn in.<br />
<br />
After a while I decided to do something else. I went back to the Circle guildhall and conned Hanns...... Ally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carson has a mole in the Highpass.&quot; repeat until no more faction is gained........ MAX ally.<br />
<br />
Went back and did the turn in and got my GMAS.<br />
<br />
Several things of note.<br />
1. I usually had to tell Hanns about the mole twice to get a faction hit. This had nothing to do with the speed at which I clicked my macroed statement because I varied it testing that.<br />
2. At one point during that conversation Hanns turned his back to talk to an NPC that had said something. Despite the fact that I was NOT sneaking I conned indifferent to him. I then moved back to his front and conned him again and was STILL indifferent. I clicked my button again, received a faction hit and was back to ally.<br />
<br />
In my case it seems that merely being ally is not enough to guarantee you don't get your box eaten. Take the time to get MAX ally. Runehammer Trollsbane<br />

When I went to her the first time after achieving ally status I had my GMAV equipped and had no trouble talking to her.<br />

My problems only began once I had combined my GMAV with the Eyerazzia and 8 poisons in the Grandmaster's box.<br />

It seems she want's to see the GMAV in your possession to talk to you.<br />

When I turned in the box and she ate it I was ally but her responce was one that suggested my faction wasn't high enough. Runehammer Trollsbane<br />

<br />
The GMAV is not a tradeskill item, it is the result of a quest in wich you must have a Grand Master's Assassin's Vial to turn in to the quest giver. The GMAV is far from trivial. All you have to do is ask anyone that has 250 makepoison skill and has failed their attempts 5+ times at great expense. Runehammer Trollsbane<br />

Gee, I'm not really attempting to hijack the thread but, at least in my case, there seemed to be something wrong with this quest.<br />
<br />
Has this happened to anyone else? I believe I read somewhere that it had and if so we need to get to the bottom of this. I'd hate for someone to lose their GMAV (especially someone that took 5-10 attempts) because of some &quot;Shaman-Epicesque&quot; faction screw up by VI. Runehammer Trollsbane<br />

Once you are able to get faction by saying &quot;Carson has a mole in the Highpass&quot; it will rise quickly. I guess it took me 20 minutes max to go from amiable to max ally.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Patofnaud</div><div class="date">11-11-02, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple points while fresh in my mind...<br />
<br />
Lon the Redeemed....<br />
<br />
Temple Of Sol Ro faction can be fixed by killing ShadowMen for a bit. There is even a camp in Lavastorm on a high plateau with about 8 spawns.<br />
<br />
If you are indiff, no one will assist Lon, but they will heal him if you are in range. So drop Spirit Of Sloth on him and walk him to zone.<br />
<br />
If you fight Lon near Zone, those sprite WILL assist. ;( So make sure no one trains them to zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Renux in WK....<br />
<br />
She will NOT give you the quest if you do not have the GMV. She WILL however accept the combined box and give you the GMS as LONG AS YOU ARE ALLY.<br />
<br />
If you SNEAK she will eat because you are INDIFF.<br />
<br />
I got the quest when I had my GMV, once I combined it in the box and hailed her again, she said she liked me but had not proven myself as a master because I no longer had my GMV (now combined in the box).<br />
<br />
I gave her the COMBINED box facing her and Ally and got my GMS.<br />
<br />
When I went to see her, there were actually FOUR of her at her spawn point. ALL FOUR responded when hailed. I just gave it to whichever doppleganger I clicked on.   <br />
<br />
Hanns...<br />
<br />
The secret area, head into Crows, under the stairs is a closet door, in closet, back right wall is a picture of &quot;crows&quot; that is the fake wall. Pass thorugh it.<br />
<br />
Head down the stairs, take a right, STOP, on you right are two torches on the riht hand wall, that is a fake wall between them and a fake floor in front of them. If you have LEV, run at an angle between the torches, if not try to jump over between them. Because if you fall, its a ways down and I only know my way if I happen to catch the first drop off.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">11-11-02, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what I did and IMHO the best way to do it. Snare lon or dont snare him just run him to zone. Zone is very close to his room. Wait till he is on top of you then zone out and right back in. At that time he should just have started walking away back to his room. Go up behind him and try to assassinate him. If it works then grats. If not zone him real fast again, rinse and repeat. Nothing will assisst anything assassinated there simply was never a call to assist. I missed assassinate on pull but on first zone I got him.<br />

<br />
I have my 1st 3 sketches, but I need to to my Dip Sketch. The small lad in AkAnon asks for: &quot;Rage of Incapacitation, Wasted Flesh, and Dreams of Drusella combined all within a coffin bottle&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, here is the confusion:<br />
<br />
These 3 poisons he ask for are the names of poisons that have already been combine into multi-charge bottles. The single dose names of those poisons are &quot;Anger of Incapacitation&quot;, &quot;Withering Flesh&quot;, &quot;Confusing Dreams&quot; respectivly.<br />
<br />
Does he actually want me to combined 3 already combine multi-charged (5 charge? 10 charge?) poisons? <br />
<br />
Or does he really want the 3 SINGLE charge poisons with original and slightly different names combined into some &quot;odd&quot; quest only item?<br />
<br />
You might say, &quot;Hell boy! Just try both!&quot; but have you tried finding Ocean Ink? It would be nice to know if can I stop keeping my friends in SG once I finish 1 combine or 10.   <br />

Ocean ink - if you only need one or two, try checking the othmir vendors in CS. Sometimes I find a couple there. Not what I consider &quot;production&quot; quantities, but enough for the quest.<br />

<br />
Can I use a 5 charge down to 1 charge arnd combine?<br />
<br />
Does using a multi charge down to 0 poof the bottle or does it become a &quot;0 charges&quot; bottle? If it don't poof will it combine?<br />

A single change I can just beg around for 1 or 2 Ocean Inks, but a full 10 charger is going to take some time.<br />

Kawaii, this is wrong information. I think you are trying to combine something that doesn't even take the master sketch to combine with. I have a reg M&amp;amp;P I got like 3 years ago and it works fine.

<br />
Another Hint: When you want to trade with Renux for GMAS and she is not up just kill Ginlin Toxfodder (was very easy at lvl 64 and NO faction hit) then the respawn goes a little faster and if your lucky next spawn is Renux.<br />

I have the Burning Rapier and Lon's head, and a Shrieking Alsphiess I looted just for the sake of fun back in the day   so all I have to do is the respective runs between zones and the sketches are mine.  The only problem is that I have an affinity for slaughtering Kiz Gix and every guard in Nek when I wander zones for fun, and I'm KoS to the Dark Elves.  I also did the uber 46-54 raids on PoG back in the day and am so KoS to the inhabitants of Kelethin that Tunare will come down herself and smite me if I even zone into Faydark.  Has anyone else had this problem and do they know if a trickster's augmentation will work or if the old sneak/hide, unhide, turn in, run like hell trick will work on the Wood Elf?  I know it will just be a simple trick with the turn in like the General for Ragebringer to turn in Lon's Head with the Dark Elves, but any tips from someone who's had the same problem would be appreciated.  I will also make sure to add my experience about this problem in a later post to help anyone else that has the same problem.  Thanks! Kaielen Kadesh<br />

What I did was get behind the DE dude that give you vein rot sketch on S&amp;amp;H.  Then come off hide, BUT (and this is important) STAY ON SNEAK, or you wont like the results, and THEN give him the items for turn in... i.e. Lon's Head and and Burning (toothpick) Rapier.  After the turn in and achieving greatness, i hastily re-hid, and at that same pace, went for the exit and got out without a scratch.<br />

<br />
Killed him yesterday with a little help (me 57 rogue, 54 ranger and 56 druid)<br />
<br />
Ranger snared and pulled to zone for druid to root on zone side of last doors.  Tazgar the efreeti DID aggro and came to zone with Lon.  Not sure if we did something wrong or just bad luck.  Zoned out.<br />
<br />
Back in and Tazgar gone, Lon still standing there.  Druid rooted again and ranger and I engage.  For lvl 40 Lon is a mean one.  Highest hit of 191 recorded, but VERY vast.  Ranger and I back off after he damn near kills us.  Druid is casting Winged Death and ES Vambs Drones during this time too.<br />
<br />
Few arrows while getting healed from ranger and I, then back on Lon.  By the time he drops, ranger and I both below half health again (no Ageo, had to do with 51 cler buffs).<br />
<br />
So, doable with a low grp, but watch the hp    Probably should have just let the druid root dot him.  Only broke root once and did not resist snare or root at all.<br />

Watch out for Merchants of Qeynos and Guards of Qeynos KoS flags if you have indiff/worse faction to start. May not be necessary to be max ally, but better safe than sorry.<br />
[X]Have GMAV (equipped?) to get Quest from Renux in WK, spawn 8/9am Gametime (maybe every three game days?), get 10 slot box to combine following:<br />

GMAV and GMAS both went great.  Doing sketches and now....  Expin over 200pp's 5 aggros and no crumpled note.  Got tired and decided to go kill Lon and dust off my Rapier in the bank.  Sneak into 3rd gate, behind Pazin un hide, still sneeking and he ATE the head and rapier.  <br />
<br />
Will try pickin Expin between 7pm and 9pm as I was not paying attention to  game time before, but has anyone done these 2 parts recently and confirm they work?  Or is this part bugged?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I had the rapier in the bank collecting dust. Thanks for the excellent walk thru.  My poison making skill is 140 and i failed on the GMAV only once.  I had the geerlok on the second time.  I was also Raid buffed so my Dex was 260.  Hope this helps some of you guys out.  Good luck.<br />

Does anyone happen to have any updated infor on the drop from Hate for the Master Sketch? I hear conflicting stories on weather it is a random abhorrent, or a mini boss Abhorrent. This is my last item to complete this quest. EIPPE'S GEAR</div></div><hr />

I &quot;hired&quot; a ranger and killed bandits all day went from dubiously to kindly/warmly in 12 hours<br />
