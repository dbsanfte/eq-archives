      They are a great place for both knowledge transfer and social interaction. Friendships have been born here and memories forged that some of us will never forget.We pride ourselves in the unique community 
      we have all built, and because of that we have become very protective of it. In hopes of preserving what some call a &quot;second home&quot;, we ask you to follow a few simple rules. </font>

        rules:</b></font></p>
