            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. BEFORE PULLING 
              THE FIRST TIME </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a.) Learn the 
              area Get yourself some maps (IMHO the best maps can be found here: 
              http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/index2e.html), study them and 
              compare them to the actual dungeon by walking through the dungeon 
              using hide&amp;sneak. Maps are nice, but nothing can make up for 
              your 1st-hand knowledge of each turn and twist of a dungeon. You 
              have to know the dungeon. During the pull, you don&#146;t have the 
              time to look at the map figuring out the way back to the camp of 
              your group. Especially in high-level dungeons like Lower Guk every 
              second can be critical. So take your time, and take a good luck 
              at the dungeon. It can save you when running from trains, and it 
              often allows you to join groups more easily, as they don&#146;t 
              have to send someone to get you from zone if you know the way yourself. 
              Also find and learn any trapdoors and illusionary walls the dungeon 
              may have. This is also a good way to do the next thing, that is... 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">b.) Learn the 
              mobs The most important thing. There are several things you ought 
              to know about the mobs you pull: <br>
              Level: To get the basic info on the mob use /con or &quot;c&quot;-key 
              or get the knowledge from other players. This should be easy. <br>
              How hard they hit: /con-ing them is nice, but doesn&#146;t always 
              give correct answers, e.g. &quot;bloodthirsty ghouls&quot; and named 
              spawns hit MUCH harder than their /con would make you believe they 
              do, another example for this is Dvinn in Crushbone. <br>
              Caster or non-caster: Usually you can tell this from their name, 
              but not always; also many mobs can &quot;cast&quot; or use spell-like 
              abilities even when they are fighters. Best example are the undead 
              froglok ghouls in Lower Guk: they can root you, which can be lethal 
              if you are too far from your group to help you or to heal you. In 
              such cases, be quick to give your group a tell where you are so 
              that they can come to your help (Try to be VERY exact, no time for 
              long speeches when a kor wizzy is nuking you). Also, high magic 
              resistance is essential [see 2a. Prepare yourself]. <br>
              Pet or no pet: this being very important, for a stuck pet can cause 
              awful trains, so you should know whether a mob has a pet or not. 
              (&quot;Uh, shouldn&#146;t he have a pet?&quot;- Famous last words). 
              <br>
              Pathing: What way will the mobs take to follow me? Is it possible 
              that he will aggro other mobs on that way, too? Also, what way will 
              he use to run away? <br>
              Aggro range: How close can I get to the mob before he will aggro 
              on me? How long can I stay near him till he will attack me? Sometimes 
              you can pass mobs that /con threatenly, but I wouldn&#146;t bet 
              on it. The fact if he aggros on you at all is also important. Some 
              mobs won&#146;t aggro on you at all, once they are &quot;green&quot; 
              enough. Others will always attack you, even when you are lev 50 
              (skeletons are a nice example for this, even at lev 40 I am still 
              attacked by them) <br>
              Aggro behavior: Will he stay aggro&#146;d on me, even when I run 
              past other players? There are a lot of mobs that will attack the 
              nearest player, not necessary the one that originally attacked it 
              (e.g. skeletons, reanimated hand, vampiric bats, gargoyles(?), and 
              others). These can be very hard, if not impossible to pull past 
              other groups. And other groups normally won&#146;t be very happy 
              if you train them with mobs. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">c.) Learn the 
              spawns The small difference between success and failure. Know where 
              the mobs spawn, how many spawn, how often they spawn and what mobs 
              spawn at a given point. This enables you to check the spawn points 
              efficiently and fast, while others just run around and hope to find 
              a mob. You should also know what mobs could possibly spawn between 
              the place where you pull from and the point where your group is 
              camping. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">d.) Know your 
              group Also a very important point. Knowing what each character in 
              your group can do is essential, too. Having healers allows you to 
              pull harder mobs. Having crowd-control allows you to pull multiple 
              targets. Having mana-makers and healers also allows you to pull 
              faster, so less break between the pulls. Know who will be the main 
              tank. All should assist the main tank, so that enchanters, bards 
              and necros can mez/charm surplus mobs. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. BEFORE THE 
              PULL </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a.) Prepare 
              yourself Before pulling, check your buffs. You should have all the 
              buffs your party can provide. Most useful are the following: HP, 
              AC buffs, resistances (magic, fire, cold), STR/DEX Buffs, STA buffs 
              (for the long runs&amp;jumps to be faster) and maybe even symbols, 
              runes and the like. SoW is essential when fighting in &quot;outdoor&quot; 
              dungeons like Cazic-Thule, Blackburrow, Crushbone, Mistmoore and 
              Unrest, but can't be cast in &quot;indoor&quot; dungeons like Upper/Lower 
              Guk, Splitpaw, Sol A/B, Permafrost, or Kedge Keep. If you can have 
              it cast on you while still outside the indoor dungeons, by all means 
              do so! Also check your health. You should be full health, for it 
              is very likely that you will loose 1-2 bub of HP during the pull 
              (at least that can happen fairly regulary in L Guk) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">b.) Prepare 
              the group Also, before pulling check the situation of your group. 
              Ask for a mana report. Let the others tell you if they are ready. 
              Wait for their &quot;okay&quot;. Nothing is more annoying than a 
              puller that says &quot;Pulling!&quot;, runs off and comes back with 
              4 red mobs to hear the cleric say &quot;LOM&quot; and the enchanter 
              &quot;OOM&quot;. In groups lev 30+ the pace you pull at it usually 
              dictated by the mana of your casters (and sadly, by the number of 
              mobs availible). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">c.) On assisting 
              This is one, if not THE most important command to use in group fighting. 
              There are several ways to use this: 1.) type /assist while having 
              a group member targeted will switch your target to same target your 
              group member has. This is the normal way to use /assist in fights 
              with several mobs. 2.) type /assist while having a mob targeted 
              will switch your target to the player that mob is attacking, usefull 
              for healers to see who is smashed to pieces and needs a heal. 3.) 
              type /assist xxxxx, where xxxxx is the name of a player. This will 
              result with you having the same target as that player, no matter 
              what you had targeted before. This is the best option if you have 
              a designated person to be assisted in all fights. Normally I have 
              a hotkey with the command /assist (tank's name) on my combat page 
              of hotkeys. MASTERING ASSISTING IS (IMHO) THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT 
              PART OF SUCCESSFUL FIGHTING IN MULTI-MOB-ENVIRONMENTS! Sorry for 
              the shout, but had to emphasise my point. :) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. THE PULL 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a.) Look for 
              possible targets After you have prepared yourself and your group 
              for the pull, go and look for possible targets. Use your (hopefully) 
              superior knowledge of the area, the mobs and the pathing of the 
              mobs to be more succesful than other pullers. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">b.) Inform group 
              Once you have found one or multiple targets, you should inform your 
              group of the pull. This can be a simple &quot;INC!&quot; or a multi-line 
              hotkey or any other sentence that clearly indicates that mobs are 
              incoming. If in doubt if your group can the the mobs you are likely 
              to pull, just ask them: &quot;Uh, ready for 2 blue wans and 1 yellow 
              zol?&quot;. If you succeed at informing your group exactly what 
              you are going to pull and are right about it, it usually earns you 
              a lot of respect in the group. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">c.) Pull Once 
              your group is informed, pull the mobs using one of these methods: 
              - use a bow, or even throwing weapons - run past them, thus aggo&#146;ing 
              them - run up to them, and attack them Using a ranged attack is 
              preferred, as you have a much greater chance of not pulling unwanted 
              mobs. With one or several mobs aggo&#146;ed on you, you should head 
              back as fast as possible to your group. Feel free to use shortcuts 
              like dropping from bridges, and also jump to get a little more distance 
              between you and the mobs. If you manage/like you can also give your 
              group another warning that mobs are &quot;INC!!!&quot;. When pulling 
              multiple mobs, make sure to target the most dangerous mob first, 
              so that those who are /assist-ing will all converge on the proper 
              target. The list of danger is in this order: 1.) Healers - #1 priority! 
              Otherwise they will sit there and heal whatever you are fighting. 
              2.) Enchanters - When half your group gets charmed you are in some 
              serious trouble. 3.) All other caster types (wizzies, mages, necros). 
              4.) Tanking mobs 5.) Caster pets Also don't attack a green creature 
              to start a pull, hitting a green will pull both the green and the 
              blue, hitting the blue will not always pull the green. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">d.) Special 
              notes on pulling caster mobs Prepare your group for a caster pull. 
              Tell them to get ready to heal you the second you are in range. 
              This is very important for pulling wizzy ghouls in L Guk, for example. 
              Another thing you may want to try (where possible) is to run past 
              the group or around another corner near the group so that he cannot 
              stop 20 feet from your group and start nuking you. By running past 
              your group for another 20 feet, you force him to stay into range, 
              following you and thus running right into your waiting group. Another 
              way to &quot;encourage&quot; the mob to melee is to sit down, which 
              will cause him to come and attack you, too. But be warned, you will 
              take maximum melee damage if the mob hits you while sitting. If 
              pulling multiple casters, have someone who can stun keep one of 
              them busy until the group can focus on it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">e.) What to 
              do in case of a bad pull Lets label it knowing when you seriously 
              messed up. You pull too many MoBs that are way to high for your 
              level party to handle. What to do? Well you got some options: <br>
              Kill yourself: Let your party know to STAY put and not help you. 
              Finda good place to recover your corpse and just let the MoBs kill 
              you and at least your party is safe. And if you have a Cleric with 
              Res in the party at least it won't take you too long to get your 
              body back. <br>
              Take Your Pull to the Zone: Try and make it to the zone. Just remember 
              to warn the zone you are coming *wink*. Save your party and yourself. 
              <br>
              Bring the Pull to the Party but Warn them it may be Hopeless: Tell 
              your evacers to be sure they got Evac Ready cause they might need 
              it. You might kill everything and be ok, but then you may need to 
              evac. If you don't have evac, be sure everyone knows they maybe 
              running for the zone or gating. Basically Keep an eye on your pull 
              after you pulled it. Did you run past somthing on your way that 
              will join your pull that wasn't there before? Did you run into a 
              Huge train on the way back that might come with you? Etc. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Other Notes 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Always have 
              the highest level tank pull if possible. The higher the level difference 
              between the puller and the target, the smaller the aggro radius 
              of the puller. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The /assist 
              command only works if the target has autoattack on. Make sure to 
              turn it on while running back after pulling. When pulling a mob 
              if you just run past it to aggro it and you run past another group 
              that is fighting, it WILL leave you and join in the other groups 
              fight usually causing much anger...You have to make sure you damage 
              the mob. Just throwing that dagger or shooting the arrow isnt enough 
              if you want to keep the mob on you back to your group, you have 
              to cause damage - the more the better. This applies to multiple 
              mob pulls as well. If you just damage one and another was in aggro 
              range and you pull past another group fighting... yes, you guessed 
              it, the second (undamaged mob) will join the fight already in progress 
              again causing much anger and shouting. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also another 
              lesson learned the hard way (i.e. much anger and shouting) is if 
              you pull past a group that is fighting and they cast an AE spell 
              of anykind (my example was a warrior using painbringer) and the 
              AE spell outdamages your initial pulling damage you WILL lose the 
              mob to that other group. In the way overcrowded dungeons being considerate 
              and using pulling etiquette can make or break your reputation. Just 
              remember the person you snaked that pull from today might be in 
              the group with the openning for you tomorrow. Do you see a particularly 
              dangerous pull? Coordinate with a nearby group to help and everyone 
              can benefit. For example ask another group to break the GIBs in 
              LGuk that were spawned (full spawn of 4). Each group kills two, 
              and both groups are happy about it because it made pulling all told 
              much nicer. <br>

              here to share some cookies. Wix hands out a batch of home-made carrot 
              cookies. These aint da posioned ones. A guide to dueling, if you 
              are scared to duel someone because they con red, this guide aint 
              for you. If ya scared to duel a lvl 50 cuz nothing in it for you, 
              then don't read it. If you don't think rogue can win any duels, 
              let alone beat any caster or warrior, then this guide aint for you. 
              This is for those who haven't given up on the rogue class, know 
              we can kick arse given the proper situation, and know we have power 
              and skills that allow us to win duels. I'll assume that you are 
              lvl 10 or higher, because backstab is a big bonus when dueling someone 
              else. I'll break this down to a class by class. I will assume you 
              are below lvl 40. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">General-Pre-Fight 
              Tips: First,try not to accept a duel, make sure they challenge you 
              first. It may be tempting to challenge, but let them do it. This 
              now gives you control of when the duel will start. If the duel starts 
              with you hidden behind them, oh well =). ALWAYS KEEP AUTOATTACK 
              ON. Do not duel like a warrior. If you duel face to face the entire 
              battle you will lose. I laugh when people say I cheat when dueling 
              because I move around and look for opportunities to land a backstab. 
              Feel free to run around a corner and hide, while they look for you 
              jump out and land that backstab. Dont be lame and stay hidden for 
              20 minutes because you are about to die, if ya gonna die, do it 
              fighting. Since we are rogues, dont feel bad about dirty little 
              tricks, if you want be a nice guy go play a paladin. Before the 
              duel, run around and look for that lvl 50 cleric and get that buff, 
              or any caster and try to get a buff before battle. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Essential equip 
              ya want to have: POISONS! For those classes you will be duking melee 
              with (Warrior and Monk epseically), use the Weakening poison which 
              will lower their attack skills ALOT. After that and on the other 
              classes, use the highest DD poisons you can get ahold of. A pumice 
              stone, or try to buy a golem wand. [Zato's note: You can no longer 
              cast a cancel magic spell or use pumice on someone who is not in 
              your group] Bandages, you can hide and Bind Wound. You will remain 
              hidden while bandaging yourself. Dwarven RingMail Tunic, essential 
              for dueling. Great resist on these babies help alot, another reason 
              while the shorties rock for being rogues. The dwarven tunic and 
              rune fork make an awesome combination. For you Human, Barbarian, 
              and Teir'dal rogues... well life is tough, and duels against magic 
              users will be tougher without this 24 extra points of magic resistance. 
              A rune bone fork is also required equipment. A bow is required, 
              throwing knives aint gonna do it. If dueling a monk or warrior then 
              use a bow to start, if its a caster then put the fork in your slot. 
              I recommend if you have a fork and a bow, make hotkeys and keep 
              them on separate slots (Page one and Page Two). You dont want to 
              throw that rune bone fork away if you accidentally press Range Attack. 
              When a caster goes invis, you can still hit them as long as they 
              are targeted. As long as you are in range and pointed in the same 
              general direction, you can hit them. Few things about backstab, 
              even though it is a backstab, well all know it is almost a side 
              stab as well. Practice with a fire beetle or something, you can 
              see you can move off to the side and still get a backstab, pretty 
              nifty eh? What's to good about this? With circle strafe, you dont 
              have to go ALL they way behind them, just circle to your about a 
              little behind their arm and backstab. It works wonders folks, use 
              circle strafe and get a little bit behind them, then backstab. Dont 
              waste your time to to get all the way behind them, the side will 
              do. Even if you dont think you are close enough backstab anyway 
              so it can be used again as soon as its ready. Circle Strafe is explained 
              below. Use the circle strafe, this is a key skill rogues must have 
              dueling or not. This skill requires the use of mouse look. When 
              you right click the mouse button and hold it, when you move using 
              the arrows keys you will strafe. You can move the mouse so you view 
              stay centered on your target while moving around. This way you can 
              make a full circle around a character without moving much, and it 
              will remain in front of your view. This is critical for moving around 
              to backstab a caster, moving to bs a monk as he instills or try 
              a flying kick, and a move any rogue worth his salt must master.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instill Doubt 
              - This is like a fear spell, which depending on your opponent will 
              make them run for 10-30 seconds. Unless you have at least 50 or 
              skill I advise concentrating on other aspects of the duel. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Disarm - Your 
              opponents weapon will disappear. It actually will go into their 
              inventory. Best thing to do is be silent and let them figure it 
              out while you whack them to hell. If they yell STOP STOP! please 
              kill them promptly. Never let anything stop a duel, if ya do, mebbe 
              ya shouldn't be dueling as it requires a certain cold hearted madness. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weapon Delay 
              - Large Two handed weapons have slow delay. Learn the timing of 
              these. I wish I could post a second to delay chart for you to reference. 
              Warrior with a big fat shiny brass halbred will swing every 3 seconds 
              or so.. SO jump in and attack them, then they are about to swing 
              back up and get out of range, they will miss and can not do anything 
              for another three seconds. Meanwhile, you jump back in with your 
              fast weapons and hit them five or eight times. It is essential to 
              abuse the fools who carry around these slow weapons. Learn the timing 
              it is crucial. In the first 30 seconds of the fight learn this weapon 
              pattern. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pre Fight Buffs 
              for Caster - If dueling a caster, they will always med before a 
              battle. This if fine and they need to do this and ya can't talk 
              em out of it. Just one thing, if they are going to summon a pet 
              or buff themselves, they MUST DUEL RIGHT AFTER THAT. Do not let 
              that caster summon a pet, sit down and med, buff them selves, sit 
              down and med, and then duel you. They must spend that mana and then 
              duel you. Allowing a caster to med after they cast a spell is a 
              big mistake. If they need to buff themselves, then they lost that 
              mana to use for the battle. Its a sacrifice they must make. But 
              of course, feel free to get all the buffs you can get. Every Class 
              that casts a spell - Circle Strafe around and get that backstab 
              when they start to cast. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Classes Warrior 
              Warriors have to be one of the Rogue's arch enemies. Since we short 
              rogues are usually towered under a barbarian or a fat troll. Even 
              dwarven warriors try to kick us around. Using some of the tips from 
              above can easily help you defeat them. Most warriors will have a 
              heavy two handed weapon. These weapons have a high delay, meaning 
              they will attack slower. Remember to let them challenge you first, 
              so you can sneak around them and land that first backstab. In the 
              first few minutes of the fight, get used to their weapon speed. 
              How slow does it attack? Can you time it to back away and avoid 
              when they swing? You should be able to and when they are about to 
              swing, get outta the way. When warriors double attack with a heavy 
              weapon it will hurt, so try to avoid that blade as much as possible. 
              After getting used to the timing and landing a backstab hide. They 
              will spin around lookin for you. You have two options here. Get 
              close and try to land a backstab or pull out that bow and kite them 
              some. If they are smart they will put out their bow and shoot you 
              back. Most are dumb and will dumbly chase you will fire arrows right 
              in their face. You will parry,dodge and block alot so they will 
              miss you. Sometime stand to to toe and let your low dly weapons 
              fly as you hit them four times for their one miss. Now lets say 
              all is well and you are both down to one or two bubbles. This is 
              the critical point in the duel its either win or lose here and the 
              fight will do down to who ever gets the last blow in. Warriors will 
              go berserk around the last bubble. Berserk means that get a STR 
              bonus and will attack faster. No playing reindeer games anymore. 
              Take them out, fight face to face, then circle strafe for a backstab. 
              Good Luck! Warriors can easily been taken taken down. We have high 
              damage weapons that hit more often, proc's gonna off like crazy 
              on them and some limited kiting ability to knock off some of them 
              hundreds of hitpoints they got. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monks These 
              are some real sumbitches. They got fast hands, almost equal or better 
              than our blazing fast weapons. They got a mend skill as well, which 
              they can use every 5 minutes for atleast half a bubble of recovery. 
              Same thing when dueling monks, let them challenge first. Now monks 
              got some other skills like instill doubt and flying kick. Im gonna 
              cover these together cuz it simple. For both skills, use same tatics. 
              Whenever someone uses instill doubt they stand still for a second 
              while they are using it. Also with flying kick, they go into an 
              animation and stand still for a second. Circle Strafe around and 
              land a backstab. Monks have better skill at instill doubt than us, 
              so they may be using it. If in middle of combat it is hard to tell, 
              but get used to what a munk looks like instill doubt, so you know 
              what in a instill doubt animation, and what is a combat animation. 
              They go thru certain moves in order. Also when the flying kick is 
              about to start they will start to go thru a crouch and then jump 
              up. Stay on your toes and be expecting this. You gotta want them 
              to do it to you, just waiting for that flying kick or instill doubt. 
              Then circle-strafe around and BOOM! Backstab! With monks, try to 
              some some of the warrior tactics. They have very fast weapons so 
              forget about trying to time their hits. Just go toe to toe, run 
              around and hide then pop out for a backstab. Try to keep them moving. 
              Use that bow for a few cheap hits, but best just to duke it out, 
              your weapon proc's should give you an advantage. And make sure to 
              get them comfortable with a face to face duel, then slip around 
              and land in that backstab. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rangers or Paladins 
              These two classes can really make ya look stupid. Pali's got blind, 
              Ranger's got snare. Can really suck if it lands on ya. Though if 
              you resist their spells you will beat them like red-headed froglocks. 
              So if you plan to win a duel against one of these guys you have 
              to have the right tools for the job. Like most duels, they are spur 
              of the moment when tempers flare, so you can't always have a pumice 
              stone or something handy. Use your fastest weapons and stay on them 
              when they are about to cast. You should interrupt once or twice. 
              Both of these classes like to use large two handed weapons. And 
              you know that that means, time these sucka's. When they&#146;re 
              about to hit get out of range, be skillful and hit them with an 
              arrow or two and jump back in and attack. Get out of range when 
              there about to hit again and lather, rinse, repeat. Keep a bow handy, 
              if you are rooted or blinded atleast you can fire it and get some 
              hits in rather than stand there and look stupid. Again the tip for 
              beating these guys is to resist their spells, otherwise it aint 
              gonna be a fun ride. Most pali are stupid folk, so you can talk 
              them in into not using lay hands before a duel. Another thing if 
              you are kicking their ass with those fast weapons, they can get 
              confused and Lay Hands on you because they forget to change target. 
              LOL, it happened and specially for those who are newbie duelers 
              it can get confusing. Rangers have a damage shield at higher levels, 
              so best wait and hide till it wears off. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Druids These 
              little mofo's love to kite. Druids having very few battle skills 
              and will resort to the same cheap tactics that allow them to solo 
              all the way to lvl 50 if they want to. Back a druid into the corner, 
              they will pull out the kite every time. If a druid doesn&#146;t 
              kite you, they gonna die. Root is the first spell they will cast, 
              again ya should resist, especially if the druid is the same lvl 
              as you and you have the aforementioned equipment. If you are rooted, 
              be prepared to stand the blast and as soon as the root breaks rush 
              them. If ya find ya self rooted with no pumice stone, pull out that 
              bow and save face. These guys have damage shields, which means every 
              time you hit them you will take damage, lame lame lame. I would 
              hide and hope they lose target. Wait about 30 seconds for the shield 
              to wear off, only expose your self if you see a for sure backstab 
              opportunity. Most tree huggers are passive folk, but they will stick 
              up if ya piss on their favorite bush. Druids have low hitpoints 
              and even better, they wear leather armor and less. This is perfect 
              for us, with our fast weapons we will hit more often, and each hit 
              will hurt because they have low ac. Druids are tough cuz of spells, 
              but if you can get on them, a few backstabs and let your weapons 
              fly they will be down to one bubble in no time. Clerics Healers, 
              should be toughest of all eh? Well if you interrupt that heal spell, 
              they will start to panic. Clerics have a few DD spells and most 
              irritating of all is blind. Again if ya dont have the right tools, 
              that first blind will get ya and they will smite ya all the way. 
              If you resist a few blinds, then you have a chance. Their melee 
              skill sucks because they have slow one handed weapons, tuff buggers 
              though because of shields and all the armor they wear. Stay on them 
              all the time, dont let up. Stick that dagger where the sun dont 
              shine. Dont give them a chance to breath, the quicker ya take em 
              out the better. Heals cast slowly, so another great chance for a 
              backstab. Again, these guys can heal, but stay on top of them the 
              entire duel and you will interrupt at least a few of those heals. 
              Blind and Root will be the spells most often cast on you by clerics, 
              so if ya resist these two, they gonna be healing themselves rather 
              than casting direct damage spells. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shadow Knights 
              or Necros Bah, evil ones. Puuuuuurrrreeeee Evil. If you have ravenscale, 
              put it on, you'll need the disease, poison resists. Both classes 
              have pets which are a major pain in the arse. Concentrate on the 
              user, don't worry about the pet. If you can, run into a high place 
              and maybe the pet will kill itself it becomes stuck. Worse thing 
              these guy have is shadowstep. Shadowstep casts super quick and teleports 
              them around to another location nearby. You can't interrupt it because 
              it casts so quickly. And while you are looking for them after the 
              teleport, you will be hit with another spell. Pumice stone is needed, 
              nasty dots will be thrown upon you. We have some extra poison resistance 
              so that helps for their wicked dot's, but if you have a pumice stone 
              I would use it on yourself. When dueling one of these you will soon 
              have 3 or 4 dot spells cast on you, best time to pull out that pumice 
              stone and save yourself.If you can get close enough to a necro you 
              will eat them up. They are super weak and have almost zero AC. One 
              good backstab when they try to cast will take away a bubble if they 
              are the same lvl as you. Necro pets are much tuffer than sk, so 
              just take the beating. SK's have a harm touch and if they are smart 
              they will wait till the end of the battle to lay it on you, this 
              can be resisted but don't count on it. Both the classes can also 
              cast engulfing darkness, no explanation needed here. I suggest a 
              pumice for each time it is cast on you, otherwise you can never 
              get close enough to spin around for a backstab. Necro's can be taken 
              out, like most casters they have weak AC, so getting in close and 
              letting your fast weapons fly, plus a few backstabs should have 
              them worried. The sk's are a tougher cookie to crack, especially 
              if they bring out a pet. Again try to use all the techniques and 
              if they are not twinked it should be a close battle. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shaman If you 
              have ravenscale, put it on, you'll need the disease, posion resists. 
              Casters, dont be confused, they have weak armor so our weapons can 
              light them up. They cast alot so lot of chances for backstabs. They 
              like to med and buff before battle so none of that buff , med buff, 
              med then duel @#%$ Again a pumice stone will definitely turn the 
              tide your way. If they have the lvl, first buff they will cast will 
              be regen on themselves, so after the duel stats first put the pumice 
              on them. They have sow and it is a pain in the ass to chase them 
              around, so try to stay close as possible and let those fast weapons 
              eat them up. If they are gonna run around and play games, simply 
              hide and wait for a good opportunity. This class can also cannalibze, 
              which means they trade HP for mana. If they have regen, its no problem 
              for them, so if you let them get away ya gonna have a very long 
              tuff fight. They can blind, root and a whole slew of nasty stuff, 
              so you need the fork and dwarven ringmail or its gonna be a very 
              tough battle. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wizards Ok, 
              if you dont have the equipment don't duel. Plain and simple, you 
              can get toasted so dont even fight if you dont give yourself an 
              advantage. You think Tyson is gonna step into the ring after the 
              first day out of jail? Hell no hes gonna train and get himself buffed 
              up. Same goes for you rogues, better go train and kill the Froglock 
              Squire and kill Emperor Crush if you have to get that tunic. First, 
              spell they cast will be root. If ya dont resist, with your high 
              magic resists this spell will only last a few seconds. Just like 
              all other casters, STAY ON THEM! Your fast weapons will hit them 
              like a blizzard, and you should be interrupting them. Everytime 
              they begin to cast a spell, circle-strafe, backstab. Remember you 
              dont have to get all the way behind them, just about behind their 
              shoulder and let it fly. They have some shields that make them invulnerable, 
              or give you fire damage, so save a pumice for that, and try to sit 
              through the roots. They have weak ac, so your backstabs should be 
              max and your weapon strikes as well. Again, wizzies are easy given 
              you have the right equipment. If you dont, you'd better go get some. 
              For you barbarians, and humans who cant wear dwarven ringmail, cheer 
              on your short brothers while they duel. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enchanters or 
              Magicians Both these classes have pets. Enchanter pets are weak 
              so try to ignore them and concentrate on the casters. Magicians 
              have earth, fire and water pets, which can be real nasty. In general 
              they are weak with low AC. Again use all the tips that apply to 
              the wizzie duels. If they are the same lvl as you, and you have 
              the right equipment you should resist. Though enchanter have tashani, 
              which lowers your magic resist. So if you see &quot;You hear the 
              barking of a dog&quot; and alittle dog icon appears in the top right, 
              use pumice on yourself PRONTO! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Submitted by 
              Cloauk Ndger When fighting in the arena, Enchanters are severely 
              limited. No pets, and when they charm you get stuck up on a pillar 
              until charm wears off. Then you fall. No problems for a rogue or 
              monk, but fear works the same why. ID can hurt someone here. :) 
              Always start with the weakening poison, the instant encumbrance 
              is a great asset to you. Disarm. You can disarm anything that a 
              PC is holding in either hand. Magical weapons, shields, Staffs, 
              books, Dolls, steins, ANYTHING! You can NOT pumice anyone that you 
              are not grouped with. Likewise, no one can cancel magic on you. 
              When you are getting nuked by a higher level fizzler, the squad 
              ring is next to worthless. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Submitted by 
              Iain 1. JBoots don't break Root. That was patched out a long time 
              ago. You need to have your Pumice Stone hotkeyed. You get Rooted, 
              you are dead, so when he roots you, pumice yourself hard. 2. If 
              he has a pet, he can't charm you. Whatever you do, ignore the pet. 
              Just don't let him kite you around with the pet beating on you. 
              3. Don't think you can switch weapons. This will not be like fighting 
              a monster. He will be moving, you will be moving. Put the SBC primary 
              and the SBD secondary. This will allow you to poison your weapon. 
              I would use the -40STR poison, since that will instantly encumber 
              him. 4. Get your resists as high as you can. Since you are pumicing 
              your roots, put the Fork in your melee slot. Screw missile weapons, 
              they DO NOT interrupt spells. 5. Constantly recharge JBoots. The 
              pattern is something like TAB, click pumice, click boots, F8. 6. 
              Save Backstab for time when he is casting. Hit instill doubt constantly. 
              Can't hurt. 7. Use the Squad Ring early. No point in saving it until 
              the end, there will be no healing. You go down to 60%, squad ring 
              yourself.<br>

              for Rogue to keep in backstab position. All group members should 
              stay on the same side of the target so Rogue can maneuver behind.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Pull targets 
              away from walls/doors/lava so that the Rogue can manuever behind

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Keep in mind 
              Rogues have about the same HP as a Shaman. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Taunt as 
              much as possible to keep target off the Rogue (see #3). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. You don't 
              have to remind the Rogue to use backstab, if you don't see them 
              doing it it's because the backstab keeps missing or the mob turns 
              on them just before they attempt it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Poisons are 
              too expensive/time consuming to be used except in the most rare 
              occasions. Even if attempted it is a one-time random effect. This 
              is subject to change, as the poison skills will be upgraded soon.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Rogues CAN 
              now walk invis, but it is VERY slow (Imagine walking with half bar 
              of health). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. If you're 
              a druid, cleric, caster, etc... and something is beating you down, 
              DON'T RUN AROUND! Makes it much harder for the rogue to backstab 
              (taunt) it off you. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. Rogues shouldn't 
              be pullers if there are tanks in a group. If a rogue pulls makes 
              it much harder to have things taunted off him. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. If a mob 
              runs let the rogue have room to backstab, don't need the whole group

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b> 
                1.1 Why play a rogue? <br>
                </b> There are many reasons one might want to play a rogue. They 
                have many utility skills which make them useful in a variety of 
                situations, namely hide, sneak, instill doubt and safe fall and 
                have the best form of invisibility in the game due to Sneak-Hide. 
                Most importantly, in Everquest, the rogue is capable of doing 
                more melee damage than the other pure melee classes (e.g. warrior, 
                monk), but only with the right equipment and if the rogue doesn't 
                have to face the enemy head-on. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                rogue also gets unique skills, such as Evade, Make Poison, Apply 
                Poison and Pickpockets. The rogue is an auxiliary tank specializing 
                in: complementing the efforts of a tank class (warrior, monk, 
                shadowknight, paladin), effective and deadly scouting, critical 
                corpse recovering, and the deadly art of poisons. In this employ, 
                the rogue can be a significant addition to a smart group. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Think 
                sneaky. Think deadly. Think assassin.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.2 
                What stats/attributes are the most important for a rogue to have?<br>
                This is an often debated topic. The general consensus is that 
                dex/agi should be over 100 to keep skills sharp, but that Strength 
                and Armor Class best serve the rogue overall. If you want to do 
                a little more damage, lean towards strength, if you want better 
                defensive capabilities pick armor class.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.3 
                I've heard Rogues have difficulty grouping. Is this true?<br>
                The current state of the EQ Rogue is a good one. Many players 
                do not realize the value that high melee damage can bring to the 
                group in minimizing downtime and conserving mana. As a Rogue, 
                your principal job will usually be to deal damage--and lots of 
                it. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">With 
                one of our special skills called 'evade', we can keep it such 
                that a creature never attacks us, and is always on the high AC, 
                high hit point tank. Not only does this consolidate damage on 
                one target (making the healers life easier), but that tank will 
                take the least amount of damage due to his or her high AC, conserving 
                mana as a whole. You are also the master of corpse recovery, able 
                to pull entire parties out of areas with ease that others could 
                only dream of. Add to this our superior scouting ability and the 
                ability to pick locks in higher level areas, and no group wants 
                to be without a Rogue. With the inclusion of poisons, our utility 
                is even more wide, as we can root, slow, dot, and direct damage 
                an enemy to make encounters that much easier. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Many 
                ideas that Rogues aren't useful stemmed from the initial release 
                of the game where a) we didn't have evade, b) there was no minimum 
                backstab damage, c) we couldn't sneak and hide at the same time, 
                d) our weapons were much more limited, e) and poisons were not 
                in the game. This is no longer the case. Rogues are a wonderful 
                class now.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.4 
                Why should I use poison?<br>
                If you have lots of time and money, it can add a lot of flavor 
                to your experiences as a Rogue. You will be more effective in 
                combat if the effect goes off and does inflicts the target successfully. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                several iterations, poison has finally become a viable resource. 
                Though many disagree with when and how often one would use poison, 
                we all agree that the current crop of poisons are not only one 
                of the best and most interesting trade skills, but probably one 
                of most rewarding as well. Be prepared to spend time gather components, 
                raising your skill, and buying the necessary suspensions however. 
                Like most trade skills, it takes time.</font></p>

                No. At level 51, the cap limit is raised. After you skill past 
                201 in Bind Wounds, the hp percentage cap is raised from 50% to 
                70%. In addition, the formula for calculating hp gained per bandage

                What does sneak do, and how can I tell if it worked?<br>
                Sneak allows you move behind enemies who would normally attack 
                you. It essentially reduces the radius in which they will attack 
                you. You still should keep your distance, as sneak is by no means 
                equivalent to invisibility, unless you are hiding as well. As 
                a Rogue, it will tell you if you are successful or not (&quot;You 
                are as quiet as a cat stalking its prey&quot;). For most creatures, 
                once you are successfully sneaking, they will &quot;con&quot; 
                (/consider) indifferent. Kunark mobs are notorious for conning 
                as &quot;scowling&quot; (hostile) even with successful sneak though 
                they likely will not attack. Be aware that hide is an invisibility, 
                but sneak is not.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now 
                comes the best part about sneak. The &quot;secret handshake&quot;. 
                If you have bad faction (whether through combat, race, or religion) 
                with a Merchant, you can neutralize the hostility by &quot;Sneaking&quot; 
                behind the merchant. Use Sneak while standing behind the merchant 
                and you will change their hostility level to &quot;Indifferent&quot; 
                and you will be able to make transactions. This works for every 
                vendor though some are more dangerous than others (groupings of 
                Merchants where sneak doesn't affect merchants behind you.) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2.4 
                What does hide do, and how can I tell if it worked?<br>
                Hide is like invisibility, but much more reliable, but it doesn't 
                cost any mana either. It most likely won't work reliably until 
                level 10+, and even then there's no guarantee until you've mastered 
                the skill. As a Rogue, the in-game text will tell you if you are 
                successful or not. You can also tell if it worked by considering 
                (/con)an enemy while hidden - if they regard you indifferently, 
                then your hide was successful (though some mobs, mostly in Kunark, 
                may continue to consider as &quot;scowling&quot;). You will remain 
                hidden until you turn Hide off or you move without Sneak. The 
                most reliable method of determining Hide success is to use the 
                F9 key and view yourself using an external, 3rd-person POV camera. 
                With successful hiding, you will not be able to see yourself in 
                3rd-person point of view. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some 
                races receive Hide at a &quot;racial skill&quot; level at the 
                start of the game. This means that their Hide ability is 50 (or 
                the equivalent of level 10) and will not improve through use until 
                the player reaches level 11. Races include Dark Elf, Halfling, 
                and Wood-Elf. </font></p>

                What can knock me out of hiding? <br>
                Your own party members are the biggest risk here. Any spell cast 
                upon you, beneficial or otherwise will knock you out of hiding. 
                This can be extremely dangerous when scouting. A Bard's songs 
                can be a Rogue's worst enemy when sneaking! When scouting for

                What is the benefit of Sneak-Hide?<br>
                Using sneak and hide at the same time (Sneak-Hide) allows a rogue 
                to move while invisible to most mobs and players! The rogue is 
                &quot;invisible&quot; to most mobs and players with the exception 
                of those that can cast &quot;See Invisible&quot;. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Unlike 
                the spell invisibility or invisibility versus undead, sneak hide 
                can be activated at the press of a button, sometimes so fast that 
                a mob at the zone won't see you if you press it immediately. As 
                a Rogue, you are in no risk of your invisibility breaking at a 
                bad time. However, there is a very small chance, rumored to be 
                based on your level, that determines if a mob can see through 
                your invis. Some mobs also just plain see anything. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
                addition, sneak and hide succeeds where all magical forms of invisibility

                classes beware. However, it drops when you zone, so be prepared.

                What is evade? When do I get it?<br>
                Evade is a skill you receive at the same level as Hide that allows 
                the rogue to not be the target of an angry creature. By targeting 
                a creature in combat, shutting off auto-attack and hitting the 
                hide button. This is harder than it sounds: for a successful evade, 
                you must be standing still as well as not attacking. A successful 
                evade will lower the aggression that the creature has towards 
                the rogue. Essentially, the rogue is placed lower on the &quot;Hate 
                List&quot; of the creature targeted. This is commonly used to 
                help shift the attention of the creature from the rogue to the 
                primary tank. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Furthermore, 
                its not as much how you evade as when. Evade takes practice, but 
                an experienced rogue can help spread around the damage to the 
                tanks while minimizing personal damage. </font></p>

                How do you pick locks?<br>
                Apparently there is a bug that is expecting the rogue to get picklock 
                skill at level 11, not a level 6. When you first get picklock 
                skill and add a point to it, you get it at your current level 
                (6). Now when you try to pick the door in Befallen, it won't work 
                because you're not at level 11 like the code says you should. 
                Therefore the door does not open nor do you gain experience. You 
                must put at least five (5) practice points into Pick Lock skill 
                to get it up to skill level 11. Once there, the door in Befallen 
                opens like butter!</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                only doors you may pick are ones with the message: &quot;This 
                door is locked and you don't have the key.&quot; There is no message 
                for failing an attempt, only for succeeding. To attempt to pick 
                a lock, click on your picklocks so that they are now stuck to 
                your cursor. Then click on the door to attempt to open it. Or 
                use your &quot;U&quot; key on your keyboard (or whatever key you've 
                defined as &quot;Use&quot;.) This prevents the potential for dropping 
                or accidental trade initiations. </font></p>

                How does pick pockets work?<br>
                You target an NPC or monster and click the 'pick pockets' skill 
                button. Upon success, you will be given some coinage, or rarely, 
                an item that was in the target's inventory. It is best to use 
                this skill on something you plan to fight anyway. Because if you 
                are detected, the creature will attack you. You can only raise 
                skill or successfully pickpocket humanoid creatures. Animals and 
                skeletons can not be pickpocketed. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                best way to use the skill is to turn your autoattack off briefly, 
                try to pickpocket, then turn autoattack back on until you can 
                pickpocket again. It is best to setup your hotkeys to make it 
                as easy as possible. Also keep in mind that for some players there 
                is a bug in which if your weapon effect goes off at the same time 
                you are toggling skills, it locks up your macro buttons until 
                you zone or relog. For picked coinage, the amount stolen decreases 
                with each successive attempt on a given target, typically by a 
                factor of two with fractions rounded downwards. If you are pickpocketing 
                NPCs, and not killing them, it is not clear when the amount you 
                are able to pick in a given shot goes back up, but it does after 
                a time. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Also, 
                it should be noted that humanoid mobs (humans, orcs, etc.) will 
                shout &quot;Stop thief!&quot; if you fail your pickpocket attempt 
                badly enough. This will alert anyone within hearing distance that 
                you are pickpocketing the mob. In other words, some players may 
                take offense to this. Pickpocketing guards as you run past them 
                out of town can be a profitable hobby as well. Be sure you are 
                ready to run however! </font></p>

                successfully pick their pockets, the several platinum, or few 
                gold they have (just like normal mobs their level) will be of

                What is backstab? How can I use it?<br>
                An extra attack the rogue gains at level 10. To backstab, a piercing 
                weapon must be equipped as the primary melee weapon. Thus, all 
                rogues should try to have piercing skill maxed by level 10. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To 
                backstab, simply target an enemy, get behind it and click the 
                backstab button. You will hit for damage times a multiplier based 
                on your backstab skill. Keep in mind your damage will be much 
                lower (on average) against difficult targets (yellow and red cons). 
                Regardless if you hit or miss, the backstab works like a taunt, 
                and the target often will turn it's attention to you. If you use 
                the backstab attack from the front, it counts as an extra, normal 
                pierce attack, but it will not trigger double attack and/or dual 
                wield. You also will not gain skill points in backstab using it 
                from the front. The skill is fairly hard to raise unless you group 
                constantly. </font></p>

                How is backstab damage calculated? <br>
                Nothing is official, but the general belief is that at low levels, 
                it works something like this: Assuming that you are using a weapon 
                deemed 'acceptable' for your level (i.e. not too powerful [some 
                players report getting very high level weapons at lower levels 
                and not getting the damage they were supposed to until they leveled 
                some more]), max damage is calculated as: (DMG * 2) + 1 + ((level 
                - 25)/3) + ((STR+SKILL)/100) Backstab simply multiplies this by 
                a constant factor. We approximate this factor to be: </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">(BACKSTAB_SKILL 
                / 25) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So 
                a maxed level 10 rogue has a backstab multiplier of (55 / 25) 
                = 2.2x. Assuming he's using a giant snake fang (DMG 5, so max 
                damage (5 * 2) + 1 = 11), his level 10 max backstab will be (11 
                * 2.2x) = 24. Backstab damage caps at 25 * DMG at level 50. Towards 
                level 20, these numbers skew. Backstab seems to top out for a 
                time, and then go up rapidly in the higher 20s. Strength effects 
                how often you hit for max damage, so be sure to have STR enhancing 
                equip and/or STR buffs on you as often as possible. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At 
                51st, the new minimum backstab damage is Level*3/2, rounded down. 
                76 is the least you will hit for at 51st, and it goes up. At 60th, 
                the minimum backstab is Level*2 (120). </font></p>

                often gain two or more points in one single run down the slope. 
                Other common places to train this skill are at the bases of the 
                wizard teleportation spires, by running off of the top level of 
                a multilevel boat, or Oasis, South Ro, and Northern Ro with their

                What is dual wield? How can I use it?<br>
                Dual wield allows you to equip a second melee weapon in your other 
                hand. Each time you attack, a roll is made based on your dual 
                wield skill, and you may or may not get an extra attack. The first 
                training point will boost the skill to 16 (or 15, unconfirmed), 
                and successive points will aid in speeding up skill advancement. 
                The level bonus present in damage over level 25 only occurs on 
                attacks performed with your primary weapon. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2.9.1 
                Does weapon speed on the dual wielded weapon affect primary weapon 
                attack speed or dual wield rate?<br>
                The delay of your primary weapon does not factor into your dual 
                wield chances. Every time your secondary weapon would swing due 
                to its delay, you will automatically check versus your dual wield 
                skill. A success will activate dual wield and you will swing your 
                secondary hand. Consequently, equipping a fast weapon in your 
                secondary hand will lead to more checks versus your dual wield 
                skill. </font></p>

                with your primary weapon. Its activation is automatic. This skill 
                starts at level 16 when the first point is put in. Once you get 
                several points into it, it will increase rapidly on its own through 
                combat. The level bonus present in damage over level 25 occurs 
                on attacks performed with your primary weapon, so successful double 
                attacks with the primary weapon will reflect the level bonus.</font></p>

                goes off, it does no damage to you whatsoever. Even if it did, 
                there is a deactivation switch nearby. So far there are no significant 
                traps that do anything besides the ones known as &quot;false floors&quot; 
                where you fall into a pit usually filled with nasty critters. 
                Unfortunately, the skill Sense Trap does not sense false floors. 
                It's really easy to train Sense Traps, just use it all the time.

                How do I disarm a trap?<br>
                Click on a moving trap to disarm it, and it will stop moving for 
                a brief period of time if you are successful in disarming it. 
                This is actually helpful when navigating a dungeon with traps 
                (e.g. Solusek A or Infected Paw) because traps, while unable to 
                do damage to you, WILL break your Sneak-Hide. Once you have disarmed 
                the trap, you can move by it. </font></p>

                What does Instill Doubt do?<br>
                Instill doubt causes the rogue to go through several combat animations, 
                and on success, will attempt a kick, which if successful will 
                send the enemy running a la the fear effect. It can not be relied 
                on as an escape ability, because success is fairly rare. Also 
                be very cautious in areas where trains start easily (e.g. Guk, 
                Solusek B). If the skill does happen to work while fighting indoors, 
                the creature may run off and come back with the entire zone which 
                won't make you or your group very happy. On the other hand, it 
                is useful as an auxiliary fearing method when fighting out of 
                doors.</font></p>

                Is there a clever way to gain points in Instill Doubt? <br>
                Yes. When walking through a zone, target a player, a corpse, an 
                NPC or any creature, and repeatedly hit instill as you walk across 
                the zone. If you are lucky, you'll gain a point. However, no effect 
                will be caused on the target in question unless you happen to 
                be within melee distance.</font></p>

                What does Disarm do?<br>
                Disarm causes the enemy's weapon to be removed from their hand 
                and either into their inventory (PCs) or onto the ground (NPCs) 
                on a successful roll. Disarm also has a small taunt effect built 
                into it. </font></p>

                What are rogue &quot;Disciplines&quot;? <br>
                They are higher level rogue skills that enable a rogue to utilize 
                a &quot;special effect&quot; for a short period of time. The reset 
                time to reuse these abilities is varies by discipline with 30-60 
                minutes being the initial time and decreasing in length as a rogue 
                gains levels. To use a discipline type &quot;/discipline [name 
                of discipline]&quot;. Only one discipline may be used at a time.

                (Level 53): 9 seconds of 100% riposte to targets in your forward 
                arc. You become a porcupine of death when this is in effect, and 
                cannot be touched by any foe facing you. You may have seen this

                What is a rogue's role in combat? <br>
                Rogues are at their best in a support tank role, best used in 
                conjunction with a traditional tank (warrior, monk, paladin, shadowknight) 
                on a single difficult enemy. Always be behind the enemy, and if 
                the enemy is facing you, attempt to Evade or back off until the 
                enemy is angrier at the main tank than it is at you. Smart group 
                members will taunt the creature off of the rogue. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3.1.1 
                How much damage can I do in combat? <br>
                The equation for maximum damage is generally thought to be (DMG 
                * 2) + 1 + ((level - 25)/3) + ((STR+SKILL)/100). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Magical 
                piercing weapons are hard to come by, but they are usually quite 
                quick. Also several weapons have special attacks (e.g. Bloodclaw) 
                to help you do more damage. Backstabs will range from your level 
                in damage up to 200 or more, but generally speaking you will be 
                doing less than 100 until you get some very good equip. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">All 
                three pure melee classes get a new damage table at 51st, and continue 
                to get better tables as they level. This table is not shared with 
                Hybrids, and means that at a given level and skill, a pure melee 
                class will out damage a hybrid with the same weapon. </font></p>

                Can I get three attacks at once, with double attack and dual wield?<br>
                Yes. Assuming of course that both your hands are wielding weapons 
                of equal delay. Since the two hands are not coupled to each other, 
                your dual wields and double attacks are not synchronized. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3.2.1 
                Can I get double attack on my second weapon if I dual wield? <br>
                Yes. Once your double attack skill reaches 150 (towards the end 
                of level 29), you get a double attack roll on your second weapon.

                This was patched to prevent players from essentially stealing 
                high level NPCs' weapons and running.</font></p>

                Can disarm be used against PCs wielding magical weapons?<br>
                Yes . In a PvP situation, rogues and monks can currently disarm 
                any weapon wielded by the opposing player. The weapon in question 
                is dropped into the inventory of the disarmed player, or, if no 
                slots are available, is placed on the cursor of the disarmed player.

                Thule. It is black and one of the rogue's pride and joys. Because 
                it is dropped and not quested for like other class armor, most 
                rogues either save all their money for Ravenscale or go to Cazic-Thule
