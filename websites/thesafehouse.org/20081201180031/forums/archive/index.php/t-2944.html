<br />
Fantasy: High Elves and Night Goblins!<br />
<br />
Did play Chaos for a short while (borrowed army) but they got boring for me. I liked the careful tactics of High Elves or the chaotic charges of Gobbos.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a better question: What's your Blood Bowl team?<br />
I've got two: High Elves and Orcs. High Elves when I wanted to try to win a game through scoring and making power teams look silly, and Orcs for when I felt like somebody needed a beat down. I did play one season where my High Elf team ended up acting like an Orc team. Every star player ability my team got were things like Toughness, Blitz, etc. I could definately catch people off guard with that team. I really need to finish painting my High Elf team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did have a league team once, it was an undead team called the Graveyard Maulers.  I had a superstar wight who kept getting awesome rolls (he had increased str and lots of good blitzer abilities), but my stupid ghouls kept getting killed so I had no real passing or recieving threat.  I think I was 4-2 or so while I was playing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've never played seriously but Fantasy I'd definately go Orcs and Goblins.  They are just too entertaining (fanatics and, doom divers, and squigs!)</div></div><hr />

Man, it'd be great to play old-school WH40k against you, especially if you're a good Harly player. I haven't played a good one in, oh, 3 years or so. I used to have an excellent 2000 and 3000 point army made up for Blood Angels built to combat Harlys. whee!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember table top games between these 2 brothers....one was a decent strategist, horrible horrible dice roller, he played Space Marines(Dark Angels).....<br />
<br />
His younger brother played Eldar, and had UNGODLY luck of the dice, enough to make you want to reach across the table and beat him silly. Well, one day they played a 2500 point battle, and the younger brother....just.....WHOOPED the space marines with his Harelquins. Like the whole friggin army. His lossess.......3 harlequins.

But remember, you can always out cheese them. Imperial Assassins from that time were the BADDEST things out on the table. Equip them right and you could have a damned good chance at besting any other model.<br />

Oh, and Death Company are very good against Harlequins. Their invulnerable save is godly against things like Harlequin's Kiss or Shrieker Cannon ammo.</div></div><hr />

The Assualt Squads are ok....they don't even begin to compare to the H2H capabilities of the Eldar. The Devastation Squads are nice....til you 250 point missle launcher is eaten in one shot by shuriken shriekers....The Imperial Assasins do rock, but they can't carry your army. Bah. I really shouldn't talk, I havent played in so long, but it was coming to the point where I stopped playing against the Eldar. It was too difficult to win against the Eldar players with the armies they would build.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frostsong</div><div class="date">06-11-02, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does one go about getting into these games?<br />
<br />
Er, let me rephrase that into something simpler: Where do you start?  I know absolutely nothing about it.<br />
<br />
I wandered into my local hobby shop and there is literally a metric ton of Warhammer stuff.  I guess there are two 'sets'; a fantasy and a sci-fi?  (I guess that's Warhammer and 40K, respectively?)<br />
<br />
I don't want to compete in a league or anything.  The local legaue seems to populated with the type of people who forget to bathe.  That's kinda harsh, I know, but they seem to exemplify every negative comic-book-store-shopper stereotype that ever existed.  I just want a fun game that my friends and I can play, but I don't know what products to get. <br />
<br />
There are books, &quot;Battle Forces&quot;, and a bazillion minatures.  is there something like a starter set that just has 2 mini armies and the rules?  If the answer to that is yes, are you stuck using those armies?  I'd hate to toss ~$90 on something only to never use those minis again if I decided to go with something different...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-11-02, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh. Let me share my dusty Warhammer knowledge with you.<br />
<br />
Go to your local gaming store(which you have). They should carry the full line of Citadel Games(and there a lot of them).<br />
<br />
Yes, gaming leagues are the suck. People bitch about the rules, bitch about your paint job, bitch about your unit selection, basically they are there to just bitch, and to make sure they win. Save leagues for if you really get into it. Otherwise, they will spoil your fun.<br />
<br />
First things first. Make sure to find a friend who will run an army with you.<br />
<br />
Second-Decide, fantasy or sci-fi(I have no opinions, both genres were great.)<br />
<br />
Third-Buy the starter box set.(Yes, I know, this #%@^ is too expensive.) You will get some starter figs to start screwing around with. Read the rules, go over the armies, learn to play a little.<br />
<br />
Fourth-Decide which army suits you, and go buy their Codex(40k) or the Fantasy book. READ IT TILL YOUR EYES BLEED.<br />
<br />
Fifth-After going over your army, think about what units you will end up running the most, and buy those in bulk(if you can get the plastic ones, do that. They are soooooo much cheaper.)<br />
<br />
I stress all this because, Warhammer is really expensive to get into. Once you start buying the pewter figs, and the paint, and the war machines, the cost goes through the roof. So I suggest to really get to know what you want to play with most of the time so you don't spend $45 on a gigantic pewter Space Marine Razorback only to find out it's too expensive to run in game, and sucks anyways.<br />
<br />
I'll say this about Citadel Minature War games. They are, hands down, the biggest money sink out of any game I have ever played. To date, EQ still hasent come close to the amount of money I blew on my Warhammer Armies. Magic the Gathering came closer, but still lost. It is an expensive game to &quot;get into&quot;. You can still buy and army, and play consistently, for about ~$70 but you won't have all the neat, uber detailed figs, and you won't be able to run anything above a 2500 point army. And the real fun starts at about 4000 points =)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frostsong</div><div class="date">06-12-02, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool. Thanks Nenjin.  <br />
<br />
According to your list, I'm now at Stage 3.  I have yet to buy the starter box.  Sooner than later, I suppose; It's hard justifying a ~$75 expense when I know I'll probably be picking up Neverwinter Nights and Warcraft 3 this month  <br />
<br />
One more question, you mentioned that I should &quot;pick an army that suits you...&quot;  Do all the armies play relatively the same?  Or are some super melee guys, some ranged, some mech specialists, etc?  Do some require massive amounts of patience and planning, whereas others are geared for a zergling-rush?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure which way I want to go.  My fiancé wants to play with the Zerg-looking guys (Tyranids, I think), and I was looking at the Protoss looking guys (Tau, I think).  Although the Orcs had such silly looking mechs and vehicles that they might be fun to play as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">06-12-02, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are planning on playing league play know this-<br />
<br />
It is full of rules lawyers and loophole exploitation.<br />
<br />
If you can compete on that level, you're fine. Find your loophole and work it to the max. But more than likely you're going to get owned by some of the cheesiest broken crap you've ever seen.<br />
<br />
So I'm seconding Nenjins opinion on the subject.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know a whole ton about 40k's new edition, but I'll say what I know about some of the armies.<br />
<br />
Tyranids-  They used to suck. As far as I know, they are still rather weak as far as armies go. They look cool and they are fun to paint. They have some of the best hand to hand troops in the game. Zerg are more akin to Tyranids than vice-versa. Most think that Starcraft 'borrowed' a bit from 40k.<br />
<br />
Tau- I have no clue about these guys. I call them 'Mecha-marines' because half of their models look like they were stolen from Robotech.<br />
<br />
Eldar- Also kinda protossy. Great speed, skill,  and ranged weapons. Physically weaker and less armored. Higher tech level. Higher cost per unit so you'll be fielding fewer models overall.<br />
<br />
Orcs- Strong potential, but random technology tends to make them weaker unless you are lucky. Low point cost per unit, low armor, tech ranges from low to absurdly high.<br />
<br />
Space Marines- Heavy armor, good tech and vehicles, highly skilled.<br />
<br />
Imperial Guard- Great vehicles, good tech, low armor, medium skill. Low point cost per unit.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-12-02, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been too far out of the loop to comment on the strengths/weaknesses of specific armies(well the eldar are probably still the cheesiest). But I will say this.<br />
<br />
Pick an army that suits you. The armies play VERY differently. For example, in fantasy Warhammer, Chaos troops were ungodly strong. Most either had more wounds that most grunts, more attacks than most grunts, better leadership than most grunts, ect....they were some of the strongest fighters. But, they had 0 ranged weaponry, and they were also ungodly expensive to buy and equip(in game..) so your armies were almost always smaller, and would often get stomped just by someone's superior number of rolls. <br />
<br />
In 40k, they leveled the playing field somewhat, but it's the special abilities of your troop types and the vehicle selection that is the biggest difference between armies.<br />
When I was in 40k....<br />
<br />
Chaos was once again expensive(for the good troops) but they had a wide range of fairly nasty special abilities, and their special characters were nasty as hell.<br />
<br />
Marines had better than average troop types, some very effective special units(Terminators roxx0r my world), decent vehicles, a wide selection of weapons, and all for a decent cost(equipment is what ends up costing you the most with space marines). They were a good, baseline army to play.<br />
<br />
Well thats about all I can suggest for now.<br />
<br />
Cao, you make it sound like agreeing with me = pulling teeth =P Edited by: Nenjin Darkeyes at: 6/12/02 1:00:36 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're more of a 'make it look cool' kinda crowd instead of the 'must win at all costs'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-12-02, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats how we were. Once you get into making terrain, the battles you can have are worth taking pics of.<br />
<br />
On the subject of leaguers, in my experience, not one was under the age of 35, all were male, and each had their own, documented take on the rules pertaining to their armies and units, so, when the fight came up, they could argue their case to the officiator concisely. It was pretty lame. On guy tried to get me dis-qualified because he said my figs weren't painted to the quality level of the tourney. @#%$. Amusingly, out of this little group of table-topers, 3 out of the 8 were lawyers. <br />
<br />
Leagues = the suck. The only thing worth winning there was a coffee cup with the Chaos Pentagram on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">06-12-02, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are braver than I you can try going to any decent hobby store and asking if they have beginner nights where they teach how to play the game. Good gaming stores will usually have some days devoted to that. Warhammer players are usually quite helpful when it comes to giving advice to new players. In fact at my local store they're far far too helpful to any female entity daring to ask about the hobby. And once they get going on their latest greatest beardy army and how it can defeat an entire space marine chapter in less than 5 turns only liberal application of blunt objects is a viable means of escape. But newbie games like that can be very useful for learning the basics of how the game plays.<br />
<br />
Oh and go Ork!! Sure, by the time you're painting the 80th ork you'll be pretty sick of them but on the other hand playing such a random army provides plenty of amusement.   Just ask Random about grots...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, as I'm a guy, I wouldn't have to deal with the geek-rush if I asked some questions.  My fiancé, on the other hand, might have some difficulties; although years of slumming in comic shops with me must have prepared her for that type of thing by now. The thing of it is, my local hobby store only runs tournaments.  I haven't ever seen a newby-night.  The behavior of some of the people in the tourny was appalling.  For example, I remember a gentleman who must have been in his mid-30's  screaming at a kid who was maybe 13 or 14.  The object of his ire was apparently the kid had killed something important, but the guy was using language that would make a sailor blush.  Over an F-ing game. <br />
<br />
At any rate, if that's the typical local tournament player, I think I'll just stay in my circle of firends, thank-you-very-much.<br />
<br />
Thing main daunting thing now is selecting an army.  There's so much crap to choose from - there's an enitre wall of my comic store devoted to it.  I get lost, and I don't know the difference between any of them.  Some you can pretty much tell how they're supposed to go.  I'm guessing the goal with Tyrranids and Orcs is to drown your opponent in numbers, for example.  The Tau look to be more of a keep-em-at-a-distance type of army.  Eldar look like space elves   What gets me is the various, uh, factions I guess - of Space Marines.  There are generic Space Marines, then Blood Angles, Space Wolves, Imperial Guard, etc.  They all look the same to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-13-02, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I remember a gentleman who must have been in his mid-30's screaming at a kid who was maybe 13 or 14.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats a pretty accurate description of what most of the tourney's are like. The reason I quit pretty much. &quot;Mature&quot; adults argue like children with people 1/2 their age is embarrasing.<br />
<br />
On the space marines, while they are about 95% identical, their history is different, and hence, their special characters, a few of their vehicles, and some of the rules pertaining to their top notch troops are a little different. <br />
<br />
Here's what I did. I looked at the armies and picked the one that was visual pleasing to me. Sat down and leafed through the army book for about 20 mins. Granted, it took me much much longer to get an idea of how to play that army, but, you can begin to see the gist of the way an army works after a little reading. The only down side is, gaming store owners are notorious about bitching you out if you sit down to read stuff like that instead of buying =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">06-13-02, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nenjin's got a good point, the armys are  pretty well balanced, and it'll be more important to stay interested in painting your army then having to learn the tactics to win with your army, in the long run. Pick what looks good. Me, I always liked Fantasy High Elves and 40k Marines. The new Tao stuff looks excellent also, very anime.<br />
<br />
The gaming store I frequented was more then happy to discuss the game with you, and also to tear the shrink-wrap off a book so you could leaf through. They understood that it takes some thinking to pick an army.<br />
<br />
lol @ tournaments. I'm a naturally fast-thinking sarcastic arse, and with strange tactics and good dice-luck, I've been the brunt of many a yellings-at. Once I had a unit of Blood Angel Death Company jumping past a couple of orc units, and sprayed it with bolt-pistol fire just because I was in range, and had nothing else to shoot at. Rolled to hit: hit, rolled for penetration: penetrated, rolled for location: main body. Ended up destroying an Orc Warbuggy with the first guy to fire. Took out a buggy with rocket launcher and heavy shoota and three models.<br />
<br />
Same tournament, I ran a single Assualt Marine who was the last surviving model of a 5 man squad into a bunker full of Eldar Dark Reapers + the Dark Reaper character (forget his name) and showed them why Mk. 1 Plasma Pistols are fun to have. If you fire one on rapid fire, they have a chance to overheat, if they overheat, they can meltdown catastrophically and explode like a plasma grenade. Marine runs in, fires at the character twice, lands two wounds, overheats the pistol, and kills every model in the bunker, (7 Dark Reapers and a ~350pt character) In a single attack. Lost the marine, but was quite exciting. Had that player lit up, too. haha</div></div><hr />

The rules lawyering in Warhammer is what eventually drove me away from playing with anyone else but friends.<br />
<br />
My ex:<br />
<br />
Chaos Lord of Khorne(Fantasy)<br />
<br />
M=8 WS=10 BS=10 Str=10(sword of death or something) T=6 W=4 Ini=10 Atk=5x2 Ld=10<br />
<br />
Now, give him sword of death(str=10) Chaos Armor + Shield + Barding = 2+ save, + Collar of Khorne(spells cannot target him, and he dispells any that have in the effect area on 4+)<br />
and Black Amulet or Medallion(4+ unmodified save).<br />
<br />
Now, I used to run this bad boy through people's army(before they changed the stinkin frenzy rules). I would play people, and they would build their army specifically to take this guy down. All the cannons got pointed at him, everything.<br />
<br />
I had a 2 hour arguement with an empire player about whether or not I would get my save against his cannons. Up and down, back and forth, unmodified means still saves against no save attacks, no it doesn't blah blah blah blah.<br />
In the end he only was really argueing with me because his cannons were the only way to even scratch my general, but it got old. And after that, every fight I brought him into, people would contest the 4+ unmodified save, and the magic nullifying collar. Finally, after taking so much heat for one freaking character in my army, I finally backed off on him. Just to piss people off though, I started bringing in Death Master Sneecth. =)<br />
<br />
-edit- incidentally, the quickest way to piss off a warhammer player is to destroy either a) a character or b) a vehicle with a pistol or a stray arrow. Edited by: Nenjin Darkeyes at: 6/13/02 10:59:49 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
I picked up the starter set, and have finished painting most of the marine models.  Next up will be the Dark Eldar, and then I'm all out of 'practice models.'  I'm only partway through the rules, though; they seem a little daunting.  I still not sure how things like mortars 'work' - the whole &quot;guess the range&quot; thing kinda throws me off.<br />
<br />
As far as picking an army goes, I'm going to go with Space Wolves.  I only have one unit so far, the Venerable Dreadnaught. <br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the help all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guessing the range works like this(in the old edition). Before you pick up the measuring tape, you need to declare what your target is, and what is shooting at it. Then you measure, roll your scatter dice, and thats where your shot lands. Dunno, they probably changed since I played.<br />
<br />
Most important thing to remember is, DONT MEASURE TIL YOU DECLARE. This rule alone can make you the enemy of veteran table-topers. Because if you measure before you declare, and find that you are out of range, you can change your units target. In fact, all shots must be declared before the measuring starts. Don't let someone declare one unit, and then measure it. All they are doing is finding some distances so they don't waste their big guns because they are out of range.<br />
<br />
And no problem, I love talking about Warhammer, it takes me back. Too bad I don't have any people to play with anymore...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frostsong</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the marines =).  Humanity defending against the onslaught of alien scum and whatnot.  When I was deciding on the army, I only knew that I didn't want to be Space Elves or Zerg things.  Although the Tyranids would be a challenge to paint and look nice...<br />
<br />
I went with Space Wolves because of, well, I guess &quot;fluff&quot; is the correct term.  I like the pseduo-werewolf-viking thing.  Plus, I wanted more of a hand-to-hand army.<br />
<br />
Dark Angels had too many sub-groups for me to really get into as a newb player.  Deathwing, Ravewing, Regular...blah.<br />
<br />
Blood Angels seemed kinda vampire-y, which isn't really my cup of tea.<br />
<br />
Ultramarines seemed cool enough, I just like the Space Wolf story better.  I haven't gotten a chance to look at any others, as I only have the Codex for Space Marines, and the Space Wolves supplement.</div></div><hr />

Warhammer 40k was even worse. I played a few games, and watched more, and it was just utterly non immersive. I just cannot handle a galactic scale SF game which claims that 30 blokes is a credible army. If the entire space orc, sorry, ork, horde invaded the USA, they wouldn't bother the Army, they'd call out the SWAT team. And don't get me started on the ranges. According to the scale of the models, Heavy weapons had a range of about 120 yards, and that was the long range sniper stuff. Standard weaponry was more like 60. Compare that with modern sniper rifles that can kill people at two MILES. I guess I'm too much a roleplayer not a wargamer....</div></div><hr />

That and all the custom scenery. Seeing 120+ figs setup on a battlefield in sniper posistions, the hover tanks hiding in the ruins, the squads all ready to run out across open ground and get mowed down by las cannons and multi-missle launchers.../shudder <br />

Those mostly suck.<br />
<br />
Really, the best Warhammer 40k game out there is Starcraft.  Which is pretty much a direct ripoff of 40k, which is in itself a mix of just Warhammer fantasy in space, and alot of stuff taken from the book Starship Troopers.<br />
<br />
And of couse, the best Warhammer Fantasy game out there right now is Warcraft 3.</div></div><hr />

Great background and writing. I read just about everything I could get my hands on. I was never much able to play the game itself, none of my friends were into it and I hated the look of leagues.<br />
<br />
But, damn.. I loved to paint up my Army. I started when the  Brits came out and made about a 5000 pt Army. Took me almost 3 years to paint them up, I'm sort of a perfectionist and didn't believe in painting anything if it wasn't done to the best of my abililty.<br />
<br />
The few games I played I did really enjoy though.. I had made a roster sheet and named all my troops ( yeah.. geeky!) with background and what not. It really makes it interesting when you have troops on the line that you have worked on so long..I got pissed when my favorite Knight Errant died =(<br />
<br />
Of course..good things end, I've moved across country and moved light, so left all my Army and odds-n-ends in my parents basement, getting married and have no room to set up a painting studio. I'm sure I'll get back into it one year..and start up a new Army and might even rope a friend into it so my highly polished troops can actually dirty their armor up!<br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing this up, Warhammer I think is one of the most underrated table top games out there, at least in the US.<br />

<br />
Ah the memories of blood-shot eyes and cramped fingers from painting to much detail on my Space Wolves. Heh, I used to get the girlfriend in on it and churn those standard grey grunts out en masse, LOL.  <br />
Still have most of my army packed away, I think I built it up to 5k pts, got some special characters and mechanical toys. <br />
I was lucky enough to have a friend group involved. 1 loved the Eldar and another went to Chaos, both of which loved to gang up on me. <br />
I tried the 'league' side, well didn't join the league but played down at the local store because they have all the nice scenery and tables to use. Had some pick-up games and, yes, that dashed any thoughts about joining a league. It's one thing to play with Min/Maxer's and Rules Lawyers in a RP setting, it's a little different on tabletop. Throw in the fact that most of the 'kids' were 14 just heightened the annoying aspect. I would assume it would hopefully be a bit better if you could actually have a judge there to run the rules in an impartial manner. <br />
Other than that I haven't had the opportunity to play, not enough time or space. I still have the army though and take it out every once in awhile to clean the dust off the paint..<br />

     The only models i have are all varied: (e.g... 5 orcs , 20 catachans and a tank and some dark elves)(i can't make up my mind)<br />
     <br />
     However i've been thinking about building a 500 pt wood elf army (using the new white dwarf rules).Are 500 pt games all that fun? And how long does an average say...1000pt game take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-02-02, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda depends on how big a battle field you have, and the make up of your armies. 500 points with only foot soldiers can take forever, mainly because you have to march across the whole field before anything happens.<br />
<br />
500 point battles are ok, but I've never really played anything with less than 2k(chaos is too expensive to play a small battle).</div></div><hr />

<br />
40k I played space dwarves till they removed them.  I could field 33 heavy bolters with my dwarf 40k army with the old rules and most the players at the local game shop played nids and orcs which meant i owned lol.  Of course dwarves are all based on heavy weapons and without that the army was trash but as they stopped making models building my armor was really cheap hitting conventions and hitting the sale boxes.  I loved the game then the made a set of rules with no dwarves for 40k and it was just no fun i had spnt tons of money on an army that i could no longer play.  And i went in depth trying it all with them from bike patrols to artilary armies.  I honestly am disapointed that they did remove that army <br />

I then played old school Necrons when they first came out, my necron tank was something to look at and gasp in amazment  <br />
Then I made a Khorne army for 40k, that wrecked havoc for my opponents as the only thing fielded from start was my heavly convered rhino tank and a squad of khorne bezerkers.<br />
I then started adding onto my Dark Elf army for fantasy, I had some of the old stuff, but I have just got some new things like the new spearmen and witch elf command group.<br />
I don't really play it now, but I have to get around to painting up my dark elf army to get it looking good  <br />

Advice: Expensive hobby - play a few times with good people,  invest sparingly and always paint what you have before buying more ... It will take me a friggin lifetime to paint all the stuff I have.  Also recommend buying Army Builder a software based Army Generation Tool - makes life alot simpler.<br />
