I once had my girlfriend stolen from me by my best friend (I had been going out with her for a month, and then she broke up with me and started going out with him a week later and they are still together, that was a year ago). Needless to say he isn't my best friend anymore, I think I've found a real friend now. So I can't see myself ever doing something like that to him. Albeit being very painful, I guess the only thing I can do is wait, and see what happens. Of course, if they were to break up, I might become the big teddy bear, because I've become very good friends with her of late, and that would shoot down any chances of a relationship for a while. Blah.</div></div><hr />

What you do is, you're gonna need to convince the two of them to move out to LA, then all three of you fly out there on your private jet, serve some wine, then get the chump out of the room when the girl goes to sleep, so when she has a nightmare about her sister calling her a #$%^, you'll totally be there and the chump will be on the #$%^per or something.

<br />
The show here is probably lagging a good way behind the US showing, so she might not even have been introduced yet. Or, she could have for all I know, as I watch like 1 episode a month   It sounds Precious though (ow)<br />
<br />
The most amusing part I've caught yet was the series of episodes where Charity was being pulled down into Hell. Hot damn that was so bad I just couldn't resist watching.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it falls into the same pitfall (for non-soap-addicts like me) as Sunset Beach and numerous other 90's US soaps: Everything takes too long to happen. If I sit down to watch Passions one day, the cliffhanger that the last episode ended with might not even be resolved during the next two consecutive episodes. It's about as fun as watching paint dry.</div></div><hr />

I (currently) value my friendship with him more than what remote possibility there might be for a relationship with her.<br />
<br />
Second, I don't think its lust, but what do I know. It's not that I just want to get in her pants or anything like that. In fact that thought simply hasn't crossed my mind. I simply enjoy her company, I think she's an awesome person. When I'm not with her I want to be, even though it's just as friends and he will always be around when I'm with her.<br />
<br />
Last night things got a little...interesting. We were planning on doing something after we all got off work. But when we finally met up it was about 10PM and we couldn't get anyone else to come out with us, so we decided we were just going to go watch Office Space at my friend's house. She didn't really want to go because she had to get up early the next morning to go work for her uncle. So my friend was saying his goodbyes for the night (I assumed) when she speeds off. My friend says everything is fine, he's gonna go get gas and then meet me at Blockbuster to get Office Space. I say OK, even though I know something is up. I figured I had a few minutes to waste since he was getting gas, so I go to check my work schedule (I work at the theatre, which is the parking lot we were in). It's almost 11 so the place is getting pretty empty. I drive over to the back door and noticed on the other side of the parking lot, her car is sitting there on and I can't see anyone in it. So I drive over to it, and she's got the seat back (layed down) with the car just idling. I hop into the passenger seat and just asked &quot;Is something wrong?&quot; When she looked at me and started to talk I could tell she had been crying. Which is the whole point of this story, it made me physically sick to see her in pain. We talked for a good 45 minutes (well she talked, I just kind of listened, I didn't want to say the wrong thing). The main gist of the conversation was that she makes all the effort in the relationship, and he doesn't. But anyway, I told her to come with me to Blockbuster and we'd figure things out. I offered to drive her home either later/early morning if she was too tired. So we go to Blockbuster, and it's closed, and he isn't there. We wait for about 15 minutes and he calls her cell phone from his house. He was really worried, he had thought I got into an accident or was pulled over or something. We both apologized and I told him that I had thought something was up so I went and talked to her. He didn't seem upset or anything. Almost like he had expected me to do it. Well, maybe not. It didn't seem to have any effect on him. Like if I had told him I stopped at my grandmother's or something instead I would have gotten the same reaction. He said I could still come over if I wanted but he was going to go to bed soon. So we all decided we'd do it again tonight, starting at a decent hour. She said she was going to go over to his house anyway, which I said I understood. Then she asked me to call her cell phone when I got home so &quot;she could make sure I made it home OK&quot;. She's never done that before.<br />
Oye, such confusion.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I like the way this is going. Some things might be good but that doesn't make it right. I don't know, I'm sure I'll have more after tonight to think about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe its just me, but that sounds a bit like he's being possessive of her. If you really are good friends with her, and you can keep it in your pants if you were alone with her, then why not try to spend time with just her? Surely she and your friend aren't joined at the hip or anything.<br />
<br />
And if your friend has a problem with that, then maybe he's not such a great friend after all.<br />

In most cases, I'd say yeah, he's a schloob if he has a problem with you two hanging out alone together, but given your attitude in this thread about the girl, I think your friend would be justified in benig nervious. Friends get to know each other pretty well, and those changes in tone and attitude will give you away. <br />

Just the other day I had a bunch of people over, and they were the last 2 to leave, and we ended up playing a board game and making him late for work, so he asked if I could take her home (they drove in the same car over to my house) so he could jet over to work. She ended up staying for another hour or so just talking, then I took her home (and she lives 30 minutes from my house so its a long drive). She's in Texas right now, on a road trip with her best friend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_BuyATradeSkill</div><div class="date">12-29-03, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. Been a while since I wrote this, but the saga continues.<br />
<br />
So I wrote that back in August. Since then we all went to different colleges (mine is 30 minutes from his, she is about 3 hours from either of us). They have stayed together throughout it all, obviously having their rocky points being in a long distance relationship.<br />
<br />
He still remains my best friend.<br />
<br />
The feelings still remain for her.<br />
<br />
He spent the weekend seeing his dad about 2 hours away (his parents are separated, his dad works out of California and comes home to see him a few times a year). She is in Texas spending Chistmas with her family.<br />
<br />
So I'm hanging out with a couple friends, when one of my closer friends brings up an interesting subject:<br />
Friend: &quot;So there is a lot of 'fire under the kettle' after what happened today, eh?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
Friend: &quot;You haven't talked to soandso?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;No, what's up?&quot;<br />
Friend: &quot;He broke up with girl today, from what I hear&quot;<br />
(he is with one of her good friends, so that's how he would know)<br />
No sooner than an hour later, I got a call from him on my cell. I was in the middle of a movie with all my friends, but I excused myself anyway to see what was up. He said he didn't want to intrude on what I was already doing, even though I said I would rather talk to him. He said he just needed to &quot;talk&quot; to me, and wanted me to call him afterward. So after we were finished (Nearly 11pm) I got home and called his cell...no answer. Left a message, now I'm sitting here contemplating this crazy turn of events.</div></div><hr />

You will be a brief interlude for her.  It will end anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks after your first make out session with her crying to you about how confused she is and how she really hates herslef, but she just has to go back to your friend and she really hopes she hasn't ruined your friendship which is very important to her and and and ...<br />
<br />
You will tell her its ok its ok and then come and tell us about how it felt like your heart was being torn to shreds etc while you were saying that but you just didn't know what else to say and now you wish you had said something else and what to do what to do?<br />

Got a problem.<br />
I'm a decent, underpaid, hardworking county coroner.<br />
It's important that my family eat meat at least three times a week.<br />
But we just can't afford to with the prices the way they are.<br />
So I bring home some choice cuts from my autopsy subjects.<br />
Just mix in the Tuna Helper... and ta - da!<br />
The whole family thinks my new meals are delicious.<br />
They ask me what's my secret.<br />
Abby, I think they're getting suspicious.<br />
My smart - ass 8 - year - old keeps asking, &quot;Where's all the meat?<br />
The red dye N2 kind that's kept in the fridge. &quot;<br />
If they find out the truth I don't think they'll understand.<br />
Abby, what do I tell my family?<br />

Good call Vyxn.<br />
<br />
If you have gone an entire semester separated from her, and she was still on your mind throughout all that (and your not an antisocial monkey, and went out at least now and then in college, and from what you've said that doesn't seem to be the case), then she definitely means something to you. Your best bet is to definitely &quot;watch and wait&quot;, try not to take sides in things, but be there for both of them. In a couple weeks when it is clear he is not on her mind anymore, start inviting her out, without him. If he's truly your best friend you guys will survive.

If you're that worried about your friend and she shoots you down...then tell him afterwards that she was coming on to you and that you shot her down and now she's talking @#%$ because she hates that you rejected her.  Nothing could go wrong that a well placed lie won't fix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now they're back together, pretty much thanks to me willingly playing middleman on New Year's Eve. Now they are both back in town but there is still tension, they keep getting in arguments, and the stupidest things will tick the other off, but then they'll start making out and they'll be fine. Methinks all that is left is the physical thing, and they don't want to break up again because its easier just to stay together. I think I'm actually going to talk to her about it (keeping my feelings out of it, hopefully) and then tell him how I really feel. Eventually. D&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Morek the rogue</div><div class="date">01-07-04, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been there man, let me tell you. Find another girl, as of now shes just a friend, thats going out with your best friend. The fact that he called to talk to you about the break up shows that he trusts you a lot, and values your opinions. No date is worth that. There are a million fish in the sea, and trust me from experience.. its not worth losing a good friendship over. Ive had it happen, seen it happen, and know that it will never happen again to me. Please trust me on this.<br />
<br />
But if you are certain you have found the one, and everything about her is what you want (not just a booty call). Then be a man about it. Let the feelings of them die down (if they break up again) and talk to your friend about asking her out. If you do that, he will at least know you arent backstabbing him and wont second guess anything you said to him during the break up. That way you are covering your bases on all sides. If she does you wrong, you both can sit and laugh at her bitchiness. If you end up getting married, your friend will be happy for ya (if he gives the ok that is). Friendships are golden bro, its easy to make friends while in school, but once that is over.. trust me, you start missing just hangin out and want those same people to hang with. And its the worst feeling in the world to know that you cant hang with someone because of a girl you didnt date but for a few months.<br />
<br />
Sounds cliche, but honesty is the best policy. Drop the hints to the guy now if you want. If you see him doing her wrong, tell him that you would love to have a girl like he has. Put it in his mind that you find her desireable, but off limits *right now*. If it goes south again, then nurture them both back to health, and make your move after you talk to him. But dont close your options off during thier relationship. You might meet someone thats just as good as her, if not better while waiting for them to break up again.<br />
<br />
Until then, be a friend, and keep her in the spank bank.<br />

nick (10:58:37 PM): guilt is a terrible feeling...which also explains why i kept calling you and zack around new years, i felt like i had to get you guys back together<br />
nick (10:59:36 PM): i hope i'm not keeping you up...it was probably stupid of me to do this tonight<br />
nick (11:12:53 PM): i'm wondering if you haven't suspected for a while...like with the way i kept calling you while you were driving on new years and things like that...i'm also wondering what your thinking and whats going to happen now, but it can't be good<br />
cindy (11:19:31 PM): ok first of all i had a slight feeling that this was coming because last night erica and candace were hinting around to it. but i had no idea you felt this way. im sorry i have put you through pain but also happiness at the same time. i dont know what to say right at this moment except that i have different feelings for each one of you guys. not saying its in a bad way. but i have to have some time to think about everything that is going on. i cant think on the spot. you know how dumb i am and that means that the brain works quite a bit slower. i can tell you that the last thing that i want to do is say something that will hurt you but i dont want to say something that will lead you on either. right now i think that i need to find myself and try and unscramble mine and zack's relationship<br />
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;cindy (11:22:44 PM): id rather it be just us being friends or continuing on. i really dont know what is going to happen. and please dont get me wrong you are a great guy and you have taught me many things from us being friends. many lessons in life that i will not forget. i am prolly going to go into the airforce and that is going to bring a whole new life for me. i am very shocked that anyone has felt the way that you have. i have always been known to push people away and not draw them near. i am very flattered about all the things you said about me and trust me you have touched my life in a special way too, but right now i need to straighten out my feelings.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
cindy (11:23:20 PM): there is no way in hell that i would totally block you out of my life for you telling me how you feel. <br />
cindy (11:23:39 PM): i wouldnt want anyone to do that to me so i would never do that to anyone else<br />
cindy (11:24:27 PM): im sorry if i have left a lot of things unsaid and i know i have but im doing it for a reason. im sorry if this doesnt bring much closure to you but i dont know what else to do right now.<br />
cindy (11:26:22 PM): also zack is bitching at me cause he knows something is going on cause he said you have been acting really weird around him lately and that you said you really wanted to talk to me. he asked if i knew anything (im sorry but damn the morals) i told him that it wasnt my place to tell him. it was between you and him. and if it takes me being out of both of your lives to make things better, then that's what i may have to do<br />
nick (11:26:47 PM): it is to be expected, you probably just handled it the best anyone in your situation could.<br />
nick (11:27:06 PM): yeah, zack is going to be very angry with me now<br />
cindy (11:27:27 PM): you are a very genuine and loving guy and always remember that people everywhere recognize that<br />
cindy (11:28:37 PM): well he is already a little pissed and that is partly my fault cause i wouldn't tell him what was going on. he told me to ask you if i could just tell him and skip all the heartache between you to, but i told him i would have to talk to you<br />
cindy (11:28:56 PM): i dont know if im handling it the best but i promise i am trying<br />
nick (11:31:32 PM): i just tried to call his cell but he didn't answer<br />
cindy (11:32:03 PM): oh<br />
cindy (11:36:00 PM): last night zack asked me what me candace and erica were talking about but i told him we were talking about erica and chris and he asked if i was lying and of course i told him i was. i told him that i didnt know if it was true but they told me that nick kind of had a thing for me. he blew up and said that they were lying, but i really didnt think it was true. if i would have known it was true i would have NEVER said anything. i think he thought they were totally lying too, so i didnt think anything of it. so i think he has an idea of what we are talking about since i wont tell him<br />
nick (11:36:48 PM): are you on the phone with him right now<br />
cindy (11:36:56 PM): no why<br />
nick (11:37:02 PM): just curious<br />
cindy (11:37:13 PM): i talked to him a while ago<br />
nick (11:37:20 PM): when did erica and candace bring this up<br />
cindy (11:38:20 PM): yesterday when we were all over there at chris's. zack would have never even asked but i was taking too long in the house. i told him he could leave cause i knew it was gonna take a while but he wouldn't <br />
cindy (11:38:50 PM): im sorry<br />
nick (11:39:00 PM): you don't have anything to be sorry about<br />
cindy (11:39:18 PM): i feel bad. i have put you in a bad situation.<br />
nick (11:39:28 PM): no, i have put myself in the situation<br />
cindy (11:40:11 PM): you really meant everything you said???<br />
nick (11:43:21 PM): every little bit of it. these feelings have just been growing since before college started. you can ask eirik, we talked practically every night. at times i would try and look for someone else to take my mind off you, like laura and sarah, but there was really only one constant through it all, and that was you<br />
cindy (11:44:01 PM): so eirik knows??<br />
nick (11:45:57 PM): he was the only person i could really talk to about it, because we kind of shared the same feeling, of wanting something we knew we couldn't have, for him it was rebecca<br />
cindy (11:46:47 PM): yeah true..... but rebecca knew.......i had no idea<br />
cindy (11:48:05 PM): if this was sooner maybe it would be easier, (not easy but easier).. im not blaming you its just how i feel and im not going to lie to you cause that is not what i like to do<br />
nick (11:48:06 PM): he probably will shy away from talking about it, we had a deep trust in each other...deeper than i had with erica obviously<br />
nick (11:48:25 PM): i'm not sure what you mean by that<br />
nick (11:48:33 PM): ryan keeps bugging me wondering if you got his email<br />
cindy (11:48:57 PM): yes tell him i will email him back tonight or in he morning. and tell him i said thanks<br />
nick (11:52:31 PM): he said thanks<br />
cindy (11:52:37 PM): yeppers<br />
nick (11:53:50 PM): i was so surprised when you said you were going to join the navy when we were bowling, when you said &quot;because i feel like my life is going nowhere right now&quot; i wanted to be like &quot;i know EXACTLY how you feel&quot; and i wanted to talk to you more about it but i was too afraid of zack<br />
nick (11:54:14 PM): i keep going all over the place in my decisions too...transferring colleges, joined rotc and then dropped out...<br />
cindy (11:55:13 PM): see everyone is afraid of what zack will think. and if he will APPROVE im tired of trying to please him<br />
cindy (11:56:43 PM): i really dont feel like im going anywhere with my life right now and i want to explore the world and broaden my horizons and continue with school so i think that is the way i can do it and keep my goals in mind and not have to settle for less than my goals<br />
nick (11:57:54 PM): i understand that completely<br />
nick (12:03:29 AM): zack really needs to answer his phone<br />
cindy (12:03:37 AM): did you try to call again<br />
nick (12:03:42 AM): yeah a couple times<br />
cindy (12:03:56 AM): huh. let me try to call and see if he answers<br />
nick (12:04:03 AM): ok<br />
nick (12:04:16 AM): what time is your first class tomorrow<br />
cindy (12:04:33 AM): i know he was on his way to simla so maybe he doesnt have service yet<br />
cindy (12:04:53 AM): tomorrow is sunday so none you goofball<br />
cindy (12:04:59 AM): he didnt answer<br />
nick (12:05:04 AM): oh, wow, i'm so dumb<br />

cindy (12:06:30 AM): im gonna make your blanket soon!!!!<br />
nick (12:07:16 AM): i don't really have any...i hope i can smooth this over with zack if he doesn't call me back tonight<br />
nick (12:07:21 AM): that is good to hear<br />
cindy (12:07:43 AM): what are you gonna tell him<br />
nick (12:08:02 AM): when i slept at his house the other night zack gave me the one you made for him, it is really nice<br />
cindy (12:08:14 AM): good you like it?????????????<br />
nick (12:08:15 AM): the truth i guess....it just depends on how i say it i think<br />

cindy (12:08:57 AM): they are really warm<br />
cindy (12:09:01 AM): and comfy<br />
nick (12:09:04 AM): yes they are<br />
nick (12:10:11 AM): when you first responded and said you were expecting something like this because erica and candace were hinting at it, i asked erica about it and she logged off<br />
cindy (12:10:31 AM): yeah that sounds like her<br />
cindy (12:10:44 AM): im not lying to you i promise<br />
nick (12:11:25 AM): i never said i thought you were<br />
cindy (12:11:59 AM): ok just checking<br />
nick (12:13:03 AM): how is bethany doing<br />
cindy (12:16:17 AM): shes alright. we hated unpacking. but we are glad to be done. she is about to read and then she is gonna go to bed<br />
nick (12:17:01 AM): tell her hello for me, and good luck for the semester<br />
cindy (12:17:12 AM): she was telling me about eiriks coach in his room<br />
cindy (12:17:16 AM): ok i will do so<br />
cindy (12:18:16 AM): she said hello and she says thanks and she doesnt know why the heck you mentioned her name for and what that meant but she said she still loves ya anyway.......and so do i<br />
nick (12:19:53 AM): you guys are too much i tell ya<br />
cindy (12:24:33 AM): yeah we know. but how are we too much. everybody tells us that but we never understand<br />
nick (12:25:36 AM): that is a good question<br />
cindy (12:25:50 AM): nick i have to tell you that i love you to death and i dont want to lose our friendship no matter what. if that is all we can have please dont take that away from me cause of zack<br />
cindy (12:27:52 AM): are you still there?<br />
nick (12:27:56 AM): yes<br />
cindy (12:28:11 AM): no answer?<br />
nick (12:28:21 AM): i am not sure what to say<br />
nick (12:28:27 AM): you know how i feel<br />
cindy (12:29:06 AM): ok so now i know i dont have that assurance but all i can do is hope for the best i guess.<br />
nick (12:29:18 AM): what?<br />
cindy (12:30:14 AM): im not sure that i will get to keep your friendship cause if zack has his way we wont be friends, but all i can do is hope for the best out of this situation<br />
nick (12:32:08 AM): do you really think that is what zack will try to do<br />
cindy (12:32:49 AM): i dont know but if he doesnt do that he wont be happy with us being friends<br />
nick (12:33:58 AM): that is probably true, but you do have my assurance that i still want you as a friend if, as you say, that is all i can have<br />
cindy (12:35:44 AM): good deal. like i said i dont want to hurt you in any way. so im gonna try to avoid that completely. so i dont know which way im leaning here but please know i do care<br />
nick (12:36:33 AM): i understand, you do have me a bit perplexed but that is ok, i can tell you are choosing your words carefully and it is for the best<br />
cindy (12:37:10 AM): why do i have you a bit perplexed??<br />
nick (12:37:59 AM): just by the way you are saying things, leaving stuff open-ended and such...<br />
cindy (12:38:14 AM): im sorry i just dont know what to do right now<br />
nick (12:38:24 AM): no need for an apology<br />
cindy (12:38:29 AM): but like what? give me an example <br />
nick (12:38:58 AM): i don't think you want me to, it might just add fuel to the fire<br />
cindy (12:39:34 AM): i dont know how much more fuel we can add to the fuel so you might as well tell me<br />
cindy (12:39:44 AM): i mean fire<br />

cindy (12:42:39 AM): what do you mean by that<br />
nick (12:42:55 AM): like when you said &quot;nick i have to tell you that i love you to death and i dont want to lose our friendship no matter what. if that is all we can have please dont take that away from me cause of zack&quot;<br />
cindy (12:43:12 AM): well its the truth<br />
cindy (12:43:41 AM): did it take you a while to type my screen name? hahahaha<br />
nick (12:44:48 AM): love is a dangerous word at this point. and you when you say &quot;if friendship is all we can have&quot; that almost sounds like a possibility at something more, just with obstacles in the way, if that makes sense<br />
cindy (12:45:03 AM): yes i totally agree<br />
cindy (12:45:42 AM): i just dont want to hurt you cause my feelings are going crazy right now. they tell me one thing and then another<br />

Quote:i have to tell you that i love you to death and i dont want to lose our friendship<br />
<br />
She means love in a platonic (friendship) way. Stop reading into that @#%$. She also said she was dumb. I believe her. No smart person, unless they are dyslexic, can possibly read that slow, yet expect someone else to type a response in five seconds.<br />
<br />
She is also reveling in her newfound power. Power over someone else because of their feelings for her. She can afford to go &quot;back and forth,&quot; as she said, because you are in love with her, not the other way around. And that is not going to change when she joins the military, especially if she is stupid. For every stupid girl that joins, there are five or ten stupid men. Look at the odds, man. They aren't good. Yeah, she goes to church, but I doubt that will stop her.<br />
<br />
Honestly I think it would be better for you if she never ever spoke to you again. She is just leading you on because she can. I know because my slut of a sister did the same @#%$ to guys in her school. She toyed with their emotions like a lion with an injured baby gazelle.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck with it. This can't end good. Bros before hoes is a good saying. Really, you should stick to it.</div></div><hr />

I understand your frustration with her and I'd say it's justified.  Oh well, maybe they don't want to say it or they don't know what they feel and how they intend to deal with the situation yet.  Either way, took balls to say that.  GL.  Though I'd guess she'll stay with zack, zack'll disown you as a friend, and she'll follow him against her will.  Personally I think that'd be better than trying to be just friends though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_BuyATradeSkill</div><div class="date">01-13-04, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well about the reading slow thing...its not just reading, its thinking. I had prepared my thoughts before this, she obviously didn't. According to the times she waited 2 minutes after saying the love friend thing before saying &quot;no answer?&quot; And honestly I just sat there staring at the screen wondering what the @#%$ to say. I know there was a damn long time between the time I stopped talking and the time she started. I was watching the chat screen, it kept saying &quot;cindy is typing a message&quot; and then it would go away, so I'm thinking she was having trouble deciding what to say. Also she was probably talking to her roommate at the time. I have an urge to call her roommate (we are old highschool friends) and prod for a little info but I'll resist that for now   Yeah she doesn't look all that smart, but I think she is smarter than she looks online, and its her caring personality and common sense that attracts me to her, not her booksmarts. Also you saw when I said that didn't sound her, she doesn't usually to the stupid joke with a &quot;hahahaha&quot;, that is more her roommate's style, which is why I confronted her about it.<br />
<br />
And now I'm defending her...egads</div></div><hr />

I went out with her, and our mutual friend (her roommate, my friend) for dinner.  I think the first time I'd met her but she kept going on and on about how the guy was a crappy guy, she cheated on him, she didn't like him, she'd dump him tomarrow.  Just talked to her boyfriend a week or 2 ago.  They're still together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just hope you learn from it and move on, and don't go overboard and become a believer in the Laddertheory or perma-disfunctional in relationships.<br />
<br />
When you fall in love in college you'll be amazed at how shallow your feelings were at this point in time.  And then if you fall in love after college you'll be further amazed at how shallow you were in college.... <br />
<br />
Oh, one more thing... relationship are all about power.  If you care less about someone than they do about you, you have power.  If they care less about you than you for them, they have power.  There's nothing you can do to get someone to care more for you when there is this power differential.  All your efforts are counter to your goals.  And all your life you've learned that expressing your love for someone helps, when in reality doing it too soon simply hurts.  <br />

No, no!  By all means, don't do THAT!!! Much better to subscribe to the Lisboa worldview on relationships (as opposed to believing all relationships are dysfunctional).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorla</div><div class="date">01-14-04, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, all kidding aside... here's my take on the situation.<br />
<br />
Cindy likes you mentally... you both are probably on the same wavelength when you talk, and you enjoy each other's company and chatting.  You could (and probably have) spent hours just talking about nothing.  However, she's only attracted to you mentally, and hasn't grown up enough to realize that it's the big picture that matters.  You probably are a good fit for her... but she doesn't see you in that way.  It's obvious by the conversation that she likes you, but &quot;not that way&quot;.  At least not now... I bet in 10 years she'll be kicking herself for not dating you.  (Do I sound like I'm talking from experience here?  lol)  Right now she loves the attention of 2 men... she's getting her mental stimulation from you and all other stimulation from Zach.     Having cake and eating it too.<br />
<br />
Zach is a good friend, and I'm sure he's upset at the fact that you like his girlfriend.  However, he doesn't want to lose you OR her.  He's in a lose-lose situation here... if he gets pissed at you, he'll lose your friendship and potentially his girlfriend.  If he lets this slide and acts like nothing's wrong, he'll still have your friendship and her sex0r.  Expect a big blowup in the future though... eventually he'll get upset because your feelings won't go away and you'll still be chatting with her.<br />
<br />
So yeah... that's my take on it.  And I'm not trying to act like Mom here, but seriously... in 10 years.. heck, maybe in 5 years, you will look back on this situation and laugh.</div></div><hr />
