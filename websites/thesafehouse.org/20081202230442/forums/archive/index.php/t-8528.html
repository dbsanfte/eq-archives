1ST EARRING OF VERACITY<br />
<br />
loc neg 988,neg 527<br />
You say, 'Hail, Torsten Reidan'<br />
Torsten Reidan says 'Oh, hello there. Sorry I didn't notice you before I was thinking of an old friend. This used to be his room. I guess no one else has been assigned to these quarters. <br />
You say, 'What old friend?'<br />
Torsten Reidan says 'His name was Bregun Dorey. What a funny little halfling he was. He had a good heart and worked hard. That is up until one day he just started acting odd, very nervous like he was hiding something. Then all he would talk about was Bixie Treats and then show off some weird heirloom charm bracelet. His time for the question came and due to his odd behavior he was sent to Marus Seru. I sure wish I knew how he was doing. <br />
Head out to Marus Seru and fine Reotho at one of the Recuso camps:<br />
You say, 'Where is Bregun Dorey?'<br />
Reothe says 'Bregun Dorey... I have not heard that name in many years. I will never forget it. He was very unique, always running around with an odd metal hat on. He swore that it would keep out the mind probing magics of the Question. I know where he was last seen, and I will tell you if you help by getting us some [supplies]. <br />
You say, 'What supplies?'<br />
Reothe says 'Get me two Bark Potions, a Spring Crystal, and a Harvest Crystal. I will tell you where I last saw him headed. If you buy them in Sanctus Seru do not tell them you are giving aid to the Recuso or you shall be prosecuted as well. <br />
Head back into Seru, get him what he wants and hand it in:<br />
Reothe says 'This is great! We can treat our ingured and have something to eat for weeks. I can vaguely recall Bregun heading towards the Lair of the Netherbians. You might ask a guard there if they have seen him.<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
You say, 'Where is Bregun Dorey?'<br />
Legionnaire Dalini says, 'Yeah maybe I know Bregun. You know, I sure am thirty with all this guard work I am doing. I know what I want, some Dawnshroud Cider! Yeah, go fetch me a cider and we will see if I remember anything when you get back.<br />
Vantak Mere sells Dawnshroud Cider for 52pp at loc 830, neg 600 in S.Seru.<br />
Legionnaire Dalini says, 'Ahhh! That is the stuff! Yeah I saw the halfling with the crazy hat. He runs around in the caverns, hanging out with the Troglodytes. It seems he somehow befriended them, I guess they enjoy his madmen antics.<br />
You say, 'Hail Bregun Dorey'<br />
Bregun Dorey says, 'Trog trog trog trog?'<br />
You say, 'Trog'<br />
Bregun Dorey says, 'Ha! What are you talking about?! Strange thing you are. Wait a minute, come closer. Are you from Norrath?<br />
You say, 'I am from Norrath'<br />
Bregun Dorey says, 'I thought so, you armor looks to be made from things found not here. Have you heard of Rivervale?<br />
You say, 'I have heard of Rivervale'<br />
Bregun Dorey says, 'Good.<br />
Say 'Good' and he he will respond and tell you he wants 4 Bixie Crunchies. When you give him the crunchies you get a bixie charm give to torsten and run back to dorey again handing himt he note torsten sent<br />
Bregun Dorey says 'Trog trog trog trog? '<br />
Bregun Dorey says 'Hahaha!  Silly Torsten.  Always snooping over my shoulder.  Well I have nothing to lose... take this to him, it's directions on how to find the Journal I kept.  I hid it where no one would look!  Haha!  Trog trog trog! '<br />
Torsten Reidan pulls out a hollow book entitled 'A Detailed Look at Etiquette and Proper Grammar' and opens it to find a journal placed inside.  'This is astounding.  The information in this journal is invaluable and must be brought to the others attention.  Take this insignia.  When you are ready to help us further seek out Euzan Jurek, tell him you were sent by me, and he will tell you what you can do to further our cause.  I can not tell you more than this, but keep the insignia close to you for now.' '<br />

Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better.<br />

2ND EARRING OF VERACITY<br />
<br />
neg 138 pos 263<br />
You say, 'torsten sent me'<br />
Euzan Jurek says 'So Torsten has sent you?  He must see the potential within you to help us.   I cannot give you any information right now as to who we are.  That is a trust you must [earn]. '<br />
You say, 'how do i earn yoru trust'<br />
Euzan Jurek leans in and whispers to you, 'Let it be known that assisting us will show your distrust in everything this city stands for.  If you do not want to get involved I urge you to walk away now.  However if you wish to [bring about change], stay and I will tell you how to earn our trust.' '<br />
You say, 'i wish to bring about change'<br />
Euzan Jurek says 'Good, you must do something for us.  One of our members, who needs not be named, is due to be called for the Question.  We need you to go into the Heart [Consillium] and replace their records with this one.  This false record shows that they have completed their Question and still have time until their next one.  Changing the records will make the question pass over us so that we avoid being discovered.  Go in stealth, when you have completed this task bring me back the original records and your Insignia Earring. '<br />
Saying consillium gets you a  general response everyone tells you<br />
Give the replacement files to the File Cabinet at loc N800, N800 2nd floor<br />
you get back the old records and a guard spawns and attacks you, I got killed but no matter still had the records. Take the old records to Euzan and he rewards you with the 2nd earring.<br />

3RD EARRING OF VERACITY<br />
<br />
Tilbok Furrunner is located @ neg144, neg1971.<br />
He is in the large castle on the second floor.<br />
Tilbok Furruner reads through the report, hands you a small satchel then starts to explain, 'Finally news from Euzan. I knew that it would take a long time to get planted within Seru, but i still worried about their mission constantly. This report shows that you have earned trust from Euzan, so I in turn will show the same trust. Euzan and Torsten were placed in the city for information. They are deep undercover and risk their life everyday. Every person in that city is ingrained with the [purpose] of either destroying Katta or converting his people.'<br />
Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better.<br />

Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Hand Legionnaries got worse.<br />
You gain party experience!!<br />
You say, 'what purpose?'<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'The teaching in the city is that Katta feigned his death to blame it on Seru. When in fact Seru actually poisoned Katta. The crusade that Seru leads is false and must be stopped. We must gain access to Seru's [chambers] and destroy him and show the city the truth.<br />
You say, 'what chambers?'<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'We do not know much about Seru's Chamber, that is what we need you to find out. This will require great effort on your part. We need you to head into Sanctus Seru and bring back reports from each Consillium. I do not know who will have these reports, and I have only heard rumor that they exist. Return to me with the Satchel full, and your Etched Earring.<br />

4TH EARRING OF VERACITY AND ARX KEY<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Tilbok Furrunner'<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'Hello there, Moro. Pleasure to meet you, I am Governor Tilbok Furrunner. I am tasked with the gathering and security of information for the Concilium Universus, the ruling council of our fine city. '<br />
You say, 'what chambers?'<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'According to these reports Seru resides in a building called the Arx Seru. It is the large complex in the center of the four Praesertum Consillium. We must take [action] now. Do not underestimate the power of Sanctus Seru for what they do they feel is right. '<br />
Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better.<br />
Your faction standing with Nathyn Illuminious got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Coterie of the Eternal Night got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Seru got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Hand of Seru got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Hand Legionnaries got worse.<br />
You gain party experience!!<br />
You say, 'what kind of action'<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'You must go see Lcea. She was Tsaph Katta's closest advisor. This matter has escalated greatly and must be placed in her hands. Ask her about the [Arx Key] she will no doubt ask in your service retrieving it. I salute your service to the city and wish you well. '<br />
You say, 'what arx key'<br />
Lcea Katta says 'The Arx Key, yes. I have read the compiled reports that have been brought to us and it seems to gain access to Arx Seru you need four shards, one from each Praesertum leader. When the time is ready each leader inserts their shard into the door of Arx Seru at the same time, and they are transported within the building. We need you to retrieve the four shards. When you have done so seek out Elnerick Augustleaf, and tell him that you serve Katta. His powers over the arcane are great and I believe he can form the shards into a single master key. Once you have received the Arx Key, place the seal given to you by Elnerick and your Runed earring in this jewel box and give it to me. I eagerly await your return. '<br />
YOU RECEIVE THE JEWELBOX<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Elnerick Augustleaf'<br />
Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Greetings Moro. I am Magistrate Elnerick Augustleaf of Katta Castellum and the Loyalist Empire. If it is arcane knowledge that you seek you have come to an excellent place to study. Not only do we have wondrous magical resources available at the Magus Conlegium but the teachings of Tsaph Katta are well known to all of our citizens and aid in preparing the mind for the freedom of thought and mental and emotional discipline needed to become a great wizard. '<br />
You say, 'i serve katta'<br />
Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Ah, I was told you would come. I hope that you have retrieved the shards from each Praesertum Leader? Please show them to me. ' <br />
you receive seal, place the seal and your current earirng into the jewelbox that lcea gives you and give the jewelbox back to lcea for the 4th earring and possibly another earring quest but im not sure at this point still need the text<br />
<br />
REWARD:<br />
4th earring stats:: 15ac, 15str, 15sta, 15wis, 15int, Truesight<br />

Hand Consilium: Signifier of the hand (N 839, P 62, P 122)<br />
Eye Consilium: Vigilum Cohortis (N 124, N 643, P 122)<br />

Praesertum Rhugol= Eye, slowable<br />
Praesertum Bikum=Shoulder, not slowable<br />
Praesertum Mapta=Heart, slowable<br />
Praesertum Vantorus=Hand, slowable<br />
<br />
All can randomly drop silk horses(WOOHOO)<br />
<br />
The banish-spot is the same for all 4 prae fights, and is down in the jail area in the southern part of the zone (near the arena, where they have some of the alien guys captured). The bind/TL trick is the most mana efficient way of doing it. CoH is expensive, and these fights tend to be fairly long. If you're very lucky, you can get the Prae into a port/summon mode where he'll port your MT then summon him directly back, but that's fairly rare.<br />
<br />
All flurry, and all hit for 500-ish if I remember right. Vantorus seems to have more hps than the others (fights tend to be longer). The all banish to the same jail location. And I've been banished when I was not hit, through a wall. Their banish is even interruptable; it's not a proc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
each of these are the heads of the consilium and drop a shard for the arx key<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_NevronEQ</div><div class="date">05-24-02, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good info, but does anyone have the level of the mobs you need to kill and how hard they hit ect. Some hard info would be good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Talras Prexus</div><div class="date">05-24-02, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nevron - you might want to explore Seru a bit if you're not kos to any houses yet, including the Katta spies. The mobs are placed exactly the same in each house: 2 on the 3rd floor, and about 7 or 8 near the Praetorian's chambers (1 on each teleporter). Eye, Heart, Shoulder: all level 60. Eye contains Ranger NPCs, Heart is Enchanter and Paladin, Shoulder is Mage (pretty sure) and something else, Hand is level 66 Warriors and Paladins, who can Enrage. They hit fast for about 180's, and their high level makes them hard to chant. Having Tash and a Shaman help  a lot.<br />
<br />
One of the mobs right inside Eye house is level 62 and sees through invis. There are also multiple class Guild Leaders in each house - they HURT, beware..<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps. I strongly suggest you mess around with the zone and learn it's pathing. There's a lot of glitches that can either save your ass, or get you dead (hi stacking mobs near Praetorian's chambers).. stacking mobs is cause by running into a side room while aggro on a certain floor, or clicking in and out of the Praetorian's chambers. Take a few days and mess around with a monk (if you have access to one) or a rogue, get to know the zone well, it will be your home for a few weeks, maybe months. Good luck~</div></div><hr />

My guild isn't that impressive by any standart and I don't think I can justify taking 2 groups of 55+'s to help me get an earring   when we could be in the mad race to hit 60.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info though</div></div><hr />

<br />
Despite the wierd aggro, dual wielding clerics and pathetic pathing, the report drops are *very* rare. Spent about 30 hours all in all trying to get the reports, had ~one~ drop  <br />
<br />
If this is how VI intended the quests to work, then I really don't think the timesink involved come anywhere near justifying the reward.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gaelle Wyndemere</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spoke to a member of one of the larger guilds on my server that was also working on this quest and what I was told was this:<br />
<br />
The reports for the third earring drop off the consiliums that are in the main part of the building, not the ones behind the clicky wall thing. That means there are only two up that have the chance of dropping the reports at any given time in each house.  He also told me that they are 40 minute spawns, and because of the rarity of the reports, the quest is hardly worth the trouble. He had been working 70+ hours and only has 3 of the reports, so its a major time sink.<br />

Personally, Id like the earring so Im going to continue trying. <br />
If i have been told wrong (kinda hope i was) please tell me. I have been killing behind the click wall, in the hallways, of the shoulder house most of the weekend and didnt see any reports, so im leaning towards the info i recieved being correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To date, farming with friends and guildies, I've seen 3 heart and 2 eye reports.  With the one exception above, they all came from inside the houses, however I've seen them both on the 3rd and 4th floors (behind the &quot;clicky thing&quot;).<br />
<br />
They're rare... but not terribly so.</div></div><hr />

to kill seru you need serubane weaponry<br />

to find the recipe, find a prae that is not in seru - 2 part book rare drop.<br />

<br />
Well, nothing else in the entirety of Sanctus Seru (that I've found) is KoS to me, but this crazy file cabinet is.  I turn in my Replacement Records (from 2nd earring quest) and the File Cabinet tells me &quot;I will do nothing to aid the likes of you!&quot; or some such message.<br />
<br />
Anyone else run into this?  If so, any idea what faction this Cabinet is on?  I'm going to try and charm it with a chanter friend of mine to see if that allows me to continue... but curious what's up with this.<br />

there is a mob called A Praesertum Functionary (a gnome) who walks arounds between all four Consillium's carring a book (visible item). Could this be a report? has anyone killed him to see?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Baric Bladewraith</div><div class="date">08-20-02, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mitrian, I had the same problem the first time as well with the silly chest.  As a rogue it was simple to just sneak and do the turn in.  When the guard popped, I just ran for the zone.  No one aggro'd and jboots was more than enough to outrun him.  I'm not sure how others can become indifferent to the chest, but Yanbik's suggestion about wolf form seem like a good one.  Did you try this when you were in bear form?<br />
<br />
The above walkthrough was great, I have the second ring and have started the third one.  I think I can get some folks in my guild to come lend a hand to get the reports.  We're there anyway exp grinding,  might as well do this too.  <br />
<br />
The fourth ring will take alot more work, on the order of four raids, one each for the four Praesertum in each consillium (I'm not a fan of long marathon raids, getting a large number of folks to stick to the same raid for many hours is always a problem).  Doesn't look to be too big a deal if broken up.  But won't know that for sure till we get in there.<br />
<br />
The fifth I can only dream off right now, but might be able to do that in the future.<br />

They hit.... 170's, I dont recall getting hit for anything higher.<br />
<br />
My issue with them is this. When we get them to 15- 20 % they &quot;warp&quot; to there spawn spot. Then your stuck with whatever mobs that aggro when they walk back.<br />

Anyone have a good strat for these guys? Other then there warping and aggroing the rest of the floor, these guys are cake, but a serious drag. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
GUILDMOB<br />
HEARTA Lictor of the Heart<br />
HANDA Signiferi of the Hand<br />
EYEA Vigilum Cohortis<br />
SHOULDERSA Custos Armorum<br />

So, in the 4th quest, it says get the shard's from the &quot;need four shards, one from each Praesertum leader&quot;.<br />

The Praesetorum Leaders were up the other night.  Though they con red they seem doable except that in the course of the fight they banish everyone to a jail cell across the zone.  The logical thing would be to pull them to that cell but cuz of the portals trapping them on that third floor that don't seem to be workable.  <br />

There are many ways to raise the faction:<br />

<br />
It's possible to have good faction with Torsten and be non-KoS within Sanctus.  The Vampyres in Tenebrous will raise Validus Custodus faction and the Thought Leeches in Mons Letalis will raise several Sanctus Seru factions.<br />
<br />
Personally, I short-cutted things.  Got the Cider in Sanctus by aggroing a bunch of MOBs and high-tailing it for the zone so that a rogue could &quot;sneak-buy&quot; from the merchant who was now alone.  Got someone else to hand in the Cider to the Legionairre in Netherbian.  After that it was just a Fedex job.<br />

<br />
Someone was pulling your leg or had no clue, they drop off any of those named in the post above including those behind the clicky things.<br />
<br />
As for picking them..no idea about the &quot;Nodrop&quot; part but I did get a whole lot of plat and fine steel off the heart and shoulder mobs when I was bored one night.  There's no real way to tell if they aren't pickable, and only if someone owns up to a pickpocket success can we confirm that they are.  You're better off just camping them..the mobs are at least dark blue xp at 65 and you'll probably have to clear them a few times to get one with a report anyway.</div></div><hr />

Then you weren't using the spell right.  Hold the report on your curser, target yourself and cast.<br />

You can also niotice that the different reports have different colored graphics.  The ones I've seen drop in the arx were shoulder reports though I've heard people say they got others there too.</div></div><hr />

Only the shoulder report drops in the arx. The other reports drop in their respective house. The Praes are easy for two groups of average level 64 players. As for the jail the Praes banish to, there is one in each house and it's not a far run back to the fight. Your best bet is to have everyone bind at the spot you'll be fighting and then have a wizard or two banished to the jail to TL people as they are ported down. The other trick is to keep a mage in each group to CoH everyone back. Pretty easy stuff. It also seems that the report drops have been increased. A year ago you could farm for 72 hours straight without seeing one. Lately I've seen people getting two or three drops in an hour.</div></div><hr />

as for faction in seru,  dont worry about it,  just head to where you need to go invisible,<br />
all the turn in guys are Katta faction and in closed rooms.<br />
<br />
when doing the reports work on one report at a time, <br />
took me about 6 hours to get a report,  i have the heart report so they do exist.  as for the location of the spawn, its the right spot but  the report is a rare drop.  the elf  is on the outside of the fake wall  .  each side has a room,  -Quite large too!,  had two groups in there  at 60 and we had a good time.  but im sure you can take a good well rounded 61+ group in there to do it.   <br />
<br />
as for raising Seru faction without Demolishing your Katta faction,  head to MS and kill stuff there. there are some caves with hooded mobs that look like the Xi  mobs from ME.<br />

hope it helps     and good luck on a truly  remarkable quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">01-22-03, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh; lots of confusion surrounding this quest   <br />
<br />
Quote:As for the jail the Praes banish to, there is one in each house and it's not a far run back to the fight.<br />
<br />
Not sure what this mean... The banish-spot is the same for all 4 prae fights, and is down in the jail area in the southern part of the zone (near the arena, where they have some of the alien guys captured).  The bind/TL trick is the most mana efficient way of doing it.  CoH is expensive, and these fights tend to be fairly long.  If you're very lucky, you can get the Prae into a port/summon mode where he'll port your MT then summon him directly back, but that's fairly rare.<br />
<br />
Rhugol -- Eye, slowable<br />
Bikum  -- Shoulder, not slowable<br />
Vantorus  -- Hand, slowable<br />
Mapta  -- Heart, slowable<br />
<br />
(I might have the last 2 reversed; doesn't matter much).  All flurry, and all hit for 500-ish if I remember right.  Vantorus seems to have more hps than the others (fights tend to be longer).  The all banish to the same jail location.  And I've been banished when I was not hit, through a wall.  Their banish is even interruptable; it's not a proc.<br />
<br />
Report drops are very streaky.  I've seen 4 drop in one clearing of a house, then none drop in like 10 clearings of a house.  The third earring is by far the most annoying to get =P  Just take a group up there and move around clearing the top floor.  Have fun with the pathing.    <br />
<br />
As for what type of mobs drops them... I forget the exact names (they were posted previously in this thread), but you can go by this guideline: Each house has 2 teleporters up to the 'top' area where the Prae spawn.  Each teleporter has a guard.  Those guards have a name.  That name is the type of mob that can drop the report for that house.  Eye house is the worst; it has very few report droppers (2 outside, 2 right at the portals, and 4-5 other random ones).  Others in that house don't drop reports.  Those names can drop the reports regardless of where they spawn in the zone.<br />
<br />
Quote:The fron 2 house leaders are slowable, back 2 aren't and has higher damage output if i am not mistaken<br />
<br />
Not exactly.  The Bikun (Shoulder prae) is not slowable.  The others are.  All can randomly drop silk horses, but it seems fairly rare, and each has their own unique piece of poop they drop.<br />
<br />
The guards in the Arx building only drop Shoulder reports, rarely.<br />
<br />
You need good Katta faction to finish this quest, and it helps to have good Seru faction to start it, but it's not required.  You can do this quest while KOS to Seru, but it takes some tricks for the first earring (since it requires talking to a Seru-aligned guard).  The rest of the stuff in the Seru zone itself can be done while KOS too; the people you have to talk to are *not* on Seru faction.  After the second earring, you need good Katta faction since it requires talking to Tilbok in Katta.  You'll likely have good katta faction after getting the 4 reports; if not, you definitely will have good katta faction after killing the 4 Prae.  And one or two Seru kills will have Katta shining your boots when you walk into the zone.<br />
<br />
Long annoying quest.      5th earring is sweet, tho. Edited by: Niin  at: 1/22/03 4:49:07 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TrueflightShok</div><div class="date">01-22-03, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been working on report gathering with a regular group. We're getting concerned not because of the report drop rate but because we don't regularly see Rhugol, Bikum, Vantorus or Mapta. In fact, since we've been tearing through the guild houses for reports, we haven't seen any one of these fellows on track at all.<br />
<br />
I read they were a 2 hour spawn, and then someone else told me it was a 3 day spawn. Well, I've been there multiple times for well more than a 2 hour stretch and haven't seen these guys pop. What is their spawn cycle? <br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Upwards of 12 days.  Seru on E'ci has gone as long as 18 days without spawning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">falderon</div><div class="date">04-21-03, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can verify that the only report that drops in the Arx is the Shoulder report.  We have done LIS around 6 times now and we average 1 shoulder report per trip.  I won the head nad have the second earring so now I am trying to do the actual reports.  SO the only way I can move up top is to Kill everything on the way up since many of the mobs in here see invis.</div></div><hr />

After I got 4th I waited 2 weeks for LCEA because 6 people can kill her now days..<br />

   Overall quest SUCKS but the payoff was well worth it.   Just a note make sure you have people willing to spend ALOT of time in seru before you loot seru's head...If no one likes you ,. you will never see 5th earring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And whats even more anoying about it is when you kill to many u become KOS and its even harder to kill the mobs you need, but the 4th earing dudes and cake since i can duo them with a mage  <br />
