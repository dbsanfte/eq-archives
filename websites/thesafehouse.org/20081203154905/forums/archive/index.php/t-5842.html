Kendrick replied with that 'sarcastic' broken thing.  Next patch it was nerfed.  THere is no way that was a coincidence.<br />

And unless you can PROVE anything about the Mrylokar's Dagger change, please stop blaming Kendrick  and the SH, and telling others how wrong they are. Both sides can't prove anything, so both opinions are to be treated equal and valid.<br />

Those dirty rats!<br />
<br />
The Safehouse should just be happy that they're raking in millions of dollars each month from you suckers and  leave the database alone!<br />
<br />
Man, I hate the Safehouse so much!  They suck at programming!  They stink at customer service!  Their 3D graphics are outdated!  Their servers always go down!  The Safehouse is evil incarnate!<br />
<br />
DOWN WITH THE SAFEHOUSE AND THEIR STUPID GAME EVERQUEST!<br />
<br />
The Safehouse should look at Verant (you know, that rogue community?) as an example.  Now THERE'S some people who have their act together.  Verant hosts a kickass website and messageboard community for the rogue class in STUPID SAFEHOUSE'S EVERQUEST GAME.  The Safehouse (BOOOO!) could learn a lot from those Verant (YAY!) guys.<br />

<br />
I never said anything about SH customer service, programming.<br />
<br />
But that's beside the point.  If both sides are to be taken equally, Jessicaa should get a warning too.<br />
<br />
I do realize I made a hasty generalization.  SH isn't to blame per se.  But, the fact that the item was posted on Safehouse, followed by a certain response led to the nerf.<br />
<br />
At least, it logically follows, inductively at best, but still follows.</div></div><hr />

We should blame FOH for the nerf.  After all, they found it.  Once they found it, it was nerfed.  Therefore its their own damn fault.<br />

<br />
A post about some uber lewt was posted on a public board.<br />
Multiple people rendered thier personal opinions about the Item on a public board.<br />
Verant nerfs (this still has yet to be proven from my understanding) an Item that was being talked about on a public board.<br />
The Public board is to blame?<br />
Some Human being who has the  right to render an opinion is to blame?<br />
Verant who owns the non public game called Everquest is to blame?<br />
Is blame the word we should be using?<br />

Than someone at VI found out that this dagger was not intendet the way it was first found by FoH. But the guy that had to change it ate to much muffins because Kendrik showed him where to pickpocket some (Glip) and he managed to rob him of all the muffins left.<br />
So basicaly the SH is to blame for we like muffins.<br />
Point proven?<br />
Don´t eat muffins! <br />
Just leave them for me!<br />
<br />
Edit: wow, the SH is the only relevant board that VI is referring to when they look there items over. Man we are good. we are so good, we are evil! Edited by: HinterDir at: 8/2/01 3:50:26 pm</div></div><hr />

How can you get angry at a measure taken by Verant to balance the game? All those people complaining about nerfs remind me of small kids that have their toy taken away. Grow up and adapt! And if this game is too hard for you, then by all means quit! <br />

<br />
coming from a level 47 like you, I can see though.<br />
<br />
You people trying to deny it and make crappy arguements of sarcasm to counter should get a clue.  WHy not ask AL or FoH, owners of the dagger, why it was nerfed.<br />

<br />
She was right the first time.<br />
<br />
Dude, if you had ever been here and actually looked at the thread in which Kendrick said that it was broken, you would have seen one of those little winking emote thingies that imply that he was JOKING.<br />
<br />
KENDRICK SAYING THE MRYLOKAR'S DAGGER OF BLOOD BEING BROKEN WAS A @#%$ JOKE<br />
<br />
  That's why she said that people who only read the FOH board don't know anything.  You can quote the man outa context if you want, but anyone (other than Furor, maybe) who read the original thread and who wasn't a complete moron could have seen that he was joking.<br />
<br />
Let it go already.  All you do is make yourself look more ignorant every time you post.<br />
<br />
Geez<br />

<br />
And did you even read Shadowcross's post, Ancalimon81?   He wasn't saying you said the Safehouse had 'customer support' or 'programing'.    He was poking fun at people who somehow blame the Safehouse for something Verant did.    The Safehouse doesn't make EverQuest.<br />
<br />
And it's even doubly stupid to blame Kendrick.   He doesn't have the power to do that.   He MAY have went up to the dev team and said, 'Hey guys.. this dagger looks a little too good.    What do you guys think?' and after they all discussed it found that to be true.<br />
<br />
Now, they probably were smoking some funny weed that day, but NO ONE PERSON AT VERANT CAN GO INTO THE DATABASE AND CHANGE AN ITEM!<br />
<br />
Hey, it may be his 'fault' for bringing it up(IF he did.   I, and most everyone, took his post for a joke), but HE DIDN'T DO IT ALONE! MORE THAN ONE PERSON AT VERANT HAD TO FEEL IT WAS OVER POWERED!    Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if EVERYONE on the dev team would have to agree on it in order to change something that dropped off Vulak.</div></div><hr />
