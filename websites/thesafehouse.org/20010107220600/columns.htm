      <p align="left"><i>The scruffy dwarf wearily dropped his traveling pack 
        to the ground beside his already dozing barbarian friend. The barbarian, 
        through his one good eye, peered at the dwarf with a hint of irritation 
        and muttered, "Ye move like a clumsy snow orc, ye blasted runt."</i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>"It be the only way ye can see me, ye blind fool," replied 
        the dwarf as he adjusted pack for use as a headrest. The barbarian's only 
        reply was a gentle snore. It had been a long three days traveling through 
        the vast Karana plains. Many encounters with the local wildlife had left 
        them both completely blown of energy and quite frankly more than a little 
        concerned about their own skins. The latest encounter with a surly bandit 
        had not gone well and thankfully they were able to lose the killer in 
        the canyons that transitioned the plains to the hills of Qeynos, legendary 
        city of the west. </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>It had been more than three weeks since they'd last seen 
        any other adventurers and the sense of "aloneness" grew on them both daily. 
        The rumors of a gnoll hideout filled with significant treasures and what 
        the bartender at the last inn had referred to as "easy pickins" had pointed 
        the two travelers to the western territories in search of the gnoll lair. 
        For the barbarian, it was the first time he'd been near his homelands 
        since he'd left as a screaming toddler in the terrified arms of a mother 
        fleeing a savage bunch of warrior gnolls. For the dwarf, it was the lure 
        of underground wonders and treasure. </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>As the dwarf rested on the ground nearby a shade tree, 
        he turned his gaze to the pillowy clouds above and the full weight of 
        his weariness began to settle on his limbs. Fighting to keep his heavy 
        lids open and some semblance of alertness, he began to mentally review 
        the proper backstab technique as taught to him by the leader of Miner's 
        Guild 628. </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>The peaceful reverie was suddenly interrupted by a tremendously 
        booming voice that literally shook the ground, </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>"THE WORLD IS COMING DOWN! LOG OUT NOW!" </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>Both the barbarian and the dwarf leapt to their feet, 
        frantically looking around in panic, both with knives at the ready. After 
        a few confused moments, the dwarf turned to the barbarian with a questioning 
        look upon his face. Silently, the barbarian shrugged unknowingly and…collapsed 
        to the ground. </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>Before the dwarf could react, the dwarf's vision became 
        clouded and the words "You have been disconnected" slipped through his 
        mind as the world vanished from sight and darkness filled everything.</i></p>
      <p align="left">Welcome to the world that <b>was</b> the Test Server. It's 
        not quite like that anymore but it makes a good intro to a column, doesn't 
        it? Welcome to my first column for The Safehouse. I'm known around these 
        parts as Kezzek Bladefiend and you may know me from such things as "Iron 
        Fist of the Forums", "That Jerk Who Moved My Post", "Keeper of the Ring", 
        or even as "Test Server Punishment Glutton". Now I'm here trying to help 
        create a bigger, better, more informative and entertaining web site. Whether 
        I'm actually helping remains to be seen… (chuckle) The purpose of this 
        particular column is to introduce myself (naturally) and to give some 
        insight into the trials and tribulations of a Test Server playtester.</p>
      <p align="left">I began playing EQ in the open beta Phase 4 on Fennin Ro. 
        I'll confess that at the time I wasn't really testing anything-I was taking 
        advantage of the PLAY portion of playtesting. Since it was the last phase 
        of the Beta test though, I don't think that was a bad thing. I later realized 
        that just by being there, Verant was able to use player load to stress 
        test their servers prior to final release. Ok…I'm rationalizing.</p>
      <p align="left">After the Beta test, I played on Fennin Ro for the first 
        couple months after final release and quickly became immersed in the glories 
        of Norrath. But, it wasn't long before I realized I missed the exciting 
        and sometimes frustrating environment of the Beta test. "Being in the 
        know", in a sense, really appealed to me and I created a (short-lived) 
        ranger on the Test Server that I would run around "testing" things. I'd 
        ram my head into walls trying to find clipping problems. I'd force my 
        character into every spot in the zone. I got stuck a lot. (I still do 
        that. Just ask me about the upper mast of the Freeport/Kaladim boats.) 
        I'd try to equip items in every slot-whoops! I can wear that gauntlet 
        on my face! That kind of stuff. It was mundane but I felt I was accomplishing 
        something. And I was accomplishing things but mostly I was just spinning 
        my wheels because I was fairly clueless about what my actual purpose was 
        as a Test Server playtester. It wasn't until I brought over a friend who 
        had more testing (from MUDs) experience than I did that I really began 
        to understand the <i>purpose, possibilities</i> and<i> responsibilities</i> 
        that a playtester has.</p>
      <p align="left">Verant, like every other company that creates an online 
        massively multi-user dungeon, has a server set aside to provide a buffer 
        for game code between the in-house models and the general public (production) 
        servers. The purpose of this is to allow the programmers to get an idea 
        of how the new game code will affect the Norrathian world but without 
        affecting the paying customers who don't wish to be (and shouldn't be) 
        exposed to glaring problems. It provides a limited "scale model" to expose 
        the code to playtesters who will promptly try to find every way to "break" 
        it. In other words, playtesters try to use the new code in every possible 
        way even above and beyond what even programmer may have imagined. This 
        is a very important step and it must be done thoroughly because if exploits 
        or "loopholes" make it onto the production servers, there are inevitably 
        big problems. Public Relations not being the least of them.</p>
      <p align="left">Now what the heck did I mean by "possibilities"? </p>
      <p align="left">Well, quite frankly, this stuff can be exciting and fun! 
        As a playtester, you are exposed to things that hundreds of thousands 
        of other players haven't seen yet AND may never see. That nifty Evade 
        skill? At first, it never failed. NEVER. That battle in the Arena with 
        lions, tigers, and skeletons? Straight outta Gladiator, baby! CARNAGE. 
        Hey, check out that new Cobalt armor! WOOO! </p>
      <p align="left">There are literally new things in the game every day on 
        the Test Server. It's refreshing! It's dynamic! It's really low player 
        population! It's the best of all worlds, right!?</p>
      <p align="left">Not so fast there. </p>
      <p align="left">With all these code changes, there are a lot of problems. 
        Sometimes very, very strange problems. That new spell update just turned 
        your Burning Rapier into rations! Whoa, that last patch just deleted your 
        bank inventory? OH NO! That new sound code killed your framerate so the 
        game is virtually unplayable? Tough nuts, buddy, it's going to be like 
        that all night or perhaps forever. </p>
      <p align="left">There is no GM or Guide support on Test Server. If you can't 
        locate your corpse even with the aid of a bard or necro? It's simply gone? 
        I'm sorry, but there's nothing that a GM can do. Your inventory is gone 
        after the patch? Sorry. "Hey, when I zoned into Blackburrow, my Runed 
        Falchion morphed into a small bag. I'm freakin' holding a bag on my hand!" 
        Sorry, can't be helped. </p>
      <p align="left">Perhaps most agonizing of all is that the entire time you 
        are on Test Server, you are inherently susceptible to problems every day. 
        EVERY single day the Test Server is taken offline at least once, usually 
        several times. Sometimes it's down for days! Each and every time the server 
        is taken offline, they "roll back" the environment a little bit. In other 
        words, those 2 bubbles of level 40 experience you just got in your overnight 
        marathon session? GONE, baby! You may even lose recently acquired items 
        simply due to the fact that they put that server back online with an earlier 
        "server save" (when the server records world environment and character 
        info). It happens. Every. Single. Day. </p>
      <p align="left">Frustrating? It certainly is. Those are just some of the 
        possibilities. Test Server is a very scary place sometimes. Just ask a 
        playtester about the item wipe. So why do it then? Well, that's up to 
        each person to decide. Perhaps you get a strong sense of accomplishment 
        for finding and reporting bugs. Maybe it feels good to converse with a 
        programmer and help them nail down that sound code. Or maybe it's just 
        pretty damn cool to be the first to have the "Ethereal Totem of World 
        Destruction". (ahem. I made that up. Get back here.) It's different for 
        every person. Ask 10 playtesters why they do it, get 500 answers. (See 
        my reference to outthinking the programmer above.) It all comes down to 
        a sense of responsibility, I think. </p>
      <p align="left">The playtesters have a responsibility to take everything 
        the programmers throw at them and work with it. No bitching. No moaning. 
        Just test it, try to work with it, and tell Verant what you find out. 
        It's the tester's responsibility to try to think of everything that Verant 
        programmers haven't. Most importantly it's the testers responsibility 
        to help make this game better through diligent testing and LARGE amounts 
        of patience and understanding. Norrath is a huge, dynamic world. Every 
        little code change can impact the world in multitudes of unforeseen ways. 
        It's a playtester's responsibility to find those ways. </p>
      <p align="left">Not every problem is readily apparent either. Maybe through 
        an unusual set of button combinations, you determined how to move while 
        rooted. Now….which button combo did it? Replicate it! Sometimes it seems 
        like you're doing forensics and trying to piece together the scene of 
        the crime. </p>
      <p align="left">So, you may now be thinking, "How do I get to this Test 
        Server anyway?" </p>
      <p align="left">It's fairly easy. Within the Everquest directory, locate 
        a file called "testeverquest.exe". That's the program that connects you 
        to the Test patch server. Be aware though that by patching to the Test 
        Server code, you will overwrite many production server code files on your 
        computer. While you won't lose any items, characters, or such (It's a 
        different server, after all.) you will be forced to sit through quite 
        an extensive patching time. Be patient. Also be aware that when you reconnect 
        to the standard servers, you'll be forced to re-patch back to the production 
        code. (Note: there is a directory trick that helps with the patch time, 
        but I won't go into it here.) </p>
      <p align="left">Hopefully, I opened your eyes a little bit about what the 
        Test Server is and does. It's definitely not for most players who simply 
        want to play the game and have fun. If you're the type who can stand a 
        little punishment in order to help make the game a bit better for others, 
        then perhaps the Test Server is right up your alley. </p>
