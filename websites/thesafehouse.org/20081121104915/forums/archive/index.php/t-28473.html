<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AngryBearsFan</div><div class="date">02-19-07, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont know if there is a forum for this game, so here is a review while I await the  servers to return.  AMD 64 3500, 2gig ram, gforce 6800 256.<br />
<br />
If you played WOW, this game will be very familiar in terms of most everything.  Clearly, they copied WOW in a lot of ways.  I enjoyed the WOW 1-60 game but quit after a month of raiding as it was boring.<br />
<br />
The first thing you notice is the graphics and the art direction.  They are really nicely done.  Some people prefer the ultra realistic graphics or EQ2, but these are very nice especially with the great art direction.  Things are placed and laid out very nicely.  And they have a nice bloom effect.  It really works well with the style of the game.  Not too much bloom like in Oblivion, and not too little like in EQ2.  I think the engine is the old AC2 engine and its surprising just how well it stands up to current games.<br />
<br />
The game runs VERY smooth and playing Beta its very polished, just like WOW was.  There is a dramatic difference in this game and Vanguard in terms of bugginess and playability.<br />
<br />
My system plays this game great, even in Bree which I think is the most laggiest.  The big thing is Ram and then a video card.  1 gig might not be enough, better to go with 2.  I have not experienced any real choppiness that hinders game play.  They still need to optimize the engine a bit and tweak some things, if they can do that with an older engine.  They went the WOW route in planing on having quite a few toons together in one place.<br />
<br />
The environmental graphics are top notch, this game is a lesson in Art Direction.  <br />
<br />
The character graphics are not up to par with the other graphics.  Again, they went the WOW route.  Lots of toons will be looking the same.  There are a few options you can fool around with and different types of Elves (Mirkwood, Rivendell) have different colors (hair, skin) to choose from so that is neat and according to lore.  But, all in all this is one of the weaker parts of the graphics engine.  It really doesnt matter to me though.  Some animations really need a bit of tweaking.  Female running (elf and human) is strange, and walking is very poorly done (think the forward moonwalk).<br />
<br />
Everyone raves about the sound and music and it hasn't disappointed me.  The Shire music is nice, the Old Forest music is a bit over the top (actually a lot over the top) Bree music is ok....I not gotten to any other parts.<br />
<br />
Lore.  They are REALLY being sticklers on the whole Lore and I guess that is a good thing.  No wizard class.  Toons have morale not hit points so there are no heals, but you raise morale.  A heal is a heal in my book so I consider it magic.  I have only seen the 2nd and 3rd Hobbit movie and only read the Simarllion so I am not a lore expert but I can tell they are sticking to the lore at all costs.<br />
<br />
Combat is, well, just ok.  It's pretty easy and not complex like EQ say where you must do certain things or you can die a horrible death.  There are crowd control spells and range weapons and monster AI is ok (they will root you and move back to fire arrows) but its not a complex system.  It will take you about 5 minutes to master combat in LOTRO, but the game is NOT about combat it is about quests.<br />
<br />
You cannot be a powergamer and have this game hold your interest, it just wont happen.  There is a specific way they want you to play and that is the &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot; type of gameplay.  EXP grinding just wont level you, EXP is bad.  You get the best EXP from quests, and there are a ton.<br />
<br />
There is also a lot of things to do to make your toon better.  Kill a bunch of flys, and you get a Fly-Swatter title.  Use a skill a lot and it opens up an upgrade.  Each &quot;zone&quot; has bunch of these types of things as well as other quests, locations to find, things to pick up.....lots of things to do, so if you do just powerlevel off mobs you will wind up gimping yourself in the end.<br />
<br />
Each race has a story arc and I think each class does too.  But, and this could be a bad thing if you roll a lot of alts, you will be doing the same quests and story arcs over and over.  Well, you dont &quot;have&quot; to do them, but I just cannot let a quest go unfinished.<br />
<br />
I think they want you to stick to your racial starting area (Human is Bree, Hobbit is shire) and do those quests then they funnel you into the Forgotten Inn area and from there Eastward to Rivendell....But, I dont think there is any penalty to make a human then run to the Shire and do all those newbie quests instead of your human ones.  You might miss out on some human lore things, but there was a Captain trainer in the Thorin's Hall (and only humans can be Captains) so they might have thought of this.<br />
<br />
Only a handful of classes and races, but all Lore.  Everyone can solo, Guardians are the only real tanks but I have been tanking content as a Captain fine.  I think once you get to the real dungeons, then you need the Guardian and Minstrel (healer).  They say they dont want to create a &quot;holy trinity&quot; but I think that is what will happen in the higher levels....but who knows.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills are WOW easy.  In fact, its almost a carbon copy.  One of the neat things is that you get one-shot recipes....these allow you to create better than average weapons and stuff (at least I think they do).  They all seem pretty nice and you can create a lot of stuff.  Right now, I am a Scholar so I can create scrolls, armor dye and the like...they also give you two other professions when you choose your primary profession.  For scholar, I got farmer and weaponsmith.  Dont ask me why, but that is what they gave me.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can smoke pipe weed and its an actually animation with the pipe...looks pretty cool.  My only gripe is that while the NPCs can sit around on logs, wagons or whatever...PCs cannot.  It would be cool to just sit in some alley and drink or something, but currently you cannot.<br />
<br />
Loot.  Eh, tough to come by for me (level 15 Captain).  Tradeskills can certain make good to even great quality items, but they have a Auctioneer (like WOW) that needs to be refined.  As usual, NO players use the buy-out option even with limited banking space.  I have only seen a couple of really nice things (purple text I think is rare or legendary) and of course it is over priced.  <br />
<br />
Quested items are ok, but they are few and far between.  Just gaining one level means you have access to that level's stuff, and it may be a LOT better than the stuff in the previous level.  Maybe I am doing the wrong quests, but I am currently decked out in NPC bought leather armor simply because I have yet to find anything better.  Stats and little increases seem really inconsequential in the noob levels, I just focused on hit points and armor rating which I can tell has an effect.<br />
<br />
If they decide to go to the &quot;crafters create the best stuff besides raid items&quot; way then there is going to be a LOT of problems.  People will just buy up and resell and you will be sol when you are trying to upgrade.  Maybe I am just in the wrong areas.<br />
<br />
I have only seen or been in one dungeon, which was the noobie spider dungeon.  No puzzles or traps or riddles...straight forward stuff.  I am hoping it improves.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of little nice touches.  You can have a family, it does not add anything but just for role-playing.  Smoking and drinking, I tried to get drunk but I couldnt even after chugging 6 flagons of wine.  Voice chat, kinship (guild) advancement, Monster play (its the only PVP and I think it will stay that way).  They should have bitten the bullet and went the Mordor route and created the evil races as PCs too....it would have been a huge undertaking, but it really would have added a lot to the game.<br />
<br />
They brought over the AC2 /music system, but it really needs a lot of work.<br />
<br />
This is a casual game for sure, powergames and harcore raiders will most likely not stay past the first month.<br />
<br />
Turbine has always been good with monthly content, and there is a LOT of stuff they can add.  I look at it like this.  Vanguard put a lot on the plate and is frantically trying to fix things.  Turbine went slow and steady and has less content BUT they have a better foundation on which to build later expansions.  I think that is the way to go, but they have to have a gameplan.<br />
<br />
My favorite part so far is what I did last night.  I had a quest in the Old Forest, and playing Interplays Fellowship of the Rings (1990) I remember just how tough that place was.  I knew I shouldnt enter and I knew I was just going to get lost, but I had to do it....sure enough, I got lost and very quickly at that.  It was amazing at how fast I got lost in there.  Lots of aggro monsters, some elite trees that move around...very few safe places so you have to be on your feet.  The graphics were nicely done (sound was over the top) but it really was scary.  I had like 5 or six mobs chasing me, no way I could live so I just started to take off and run.  I ran and ran, into a bunch of webs where I fell off a small cliff into spider central.  I lost the monster aggro, but now I had to get out.<br />
<br />
I was doing something the characters did in the movies, get lost in the Old Forest and for that time it really felt like I was a part of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Once they start adding a few expansions I can see this game being a real powerhouse.  There are so many things to do and places to explore, and judging by the map they are going to add a lot.<br />
<br />
It will be released pretty much playable and stable, it already is in closed Beta so all they really have to worry about is stress testing and polishing up some things (pet AI is horrible...my squire poofs every time I turn my back on him)<br />
<br />
Buying it at release is a real option, unlike Vanguard simply because my system probably wouldnt handle it that well.  But like I said, you have to be in a certain mind set to play this game.  Powergame it, and you will get bored in one session.  Play with a couple of friends and just do stuff for the heck of it and you will enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Ok, I need to log back in and kill two goblin chiefs.....or were they goblin chefs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chromite</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very thorough review, nicely done.<br />
<br />
One thing you didn't seem to experience is the memory leak.  Had you stayed in game long enough and moved to enough very populated areas then you would experience it.  Since you had 2 gigs of memory it was delayed for you.<br />
<br />
Most folks have 1 gig of memory and this game really should not (and doesn't) require that you have 2 gigs.  But with the memory leak, it really cripples gameplay and you have to exit the game completely and reload/relogin to get it cleared up.  I think the leak is caused by character models/textures because the more populated the game is, the faster the memory leak happens.<br />
<br />
Until they fix this problem, I certainly won't be buying the game.  I'm having a blast with the game but I won't pay for something that's broken like that.<br />
<br />
With regards to the holy trinity type of thing, I don't see that happening much but there IS the &quot;Must have a cleric!&quot; problem.  (i.e. everyone screams for a Minstrel)</div></div><hr />

OMG I need to log into this right now!  How much longer is beta?<br />
<br />
Nice review, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still downloading the client.  3 gigs, and if you don't use BitTorrent, you lose chunks (400 megs or more) if you close their DL client before it finishes a part.  Definitely use the torrents.  Sounds like the beta will last about another two months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matheren</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got in a few days ago, mostly play when my friends aren't on WoW. Overall I'm not too impressed with the game.. it feels like WoW with slightly worse looking characters, and so far some fairly boring newbie monster models.<br />
<br />
None of the classes seem very appealing to me, but I suppose they might be a bit cooler at higher levels. Still, I enjoyed the Warlock, Paladin, and Shaman classes in WoW very early.<br />
<br />
Unless the game completely turns around after levels 6-10, I couldn't ever see myself buying it. I've put my time in WoW, so I may as well stick with that instead of switching to what honestly looks like a carbon copy game with a slightly different (and sometimes worse) graphics engine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AngryBearsFan</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play in America but am in European Beta (go figure) so there is a lot less people on that one server.  Plus, 2 gigs of ram is becoming the minimum these days.<br />
<br />
I have not experienced any memory leak or any massive slow down and I have played the usual 8 hour all nighters, for about 6 days.  Everything runs very well for a Beta and there is some herky-jerkyness but its very much playable for me (and I am a stickler about that kind of thing).<br />
<br />
I downloaded the client VIA Codemasters (Euro Beta) and got an awesome ping...maybe I was one of the first downloading it, but the whole thing (3.5gig) only took like three hours.  I would advise you to use a download manager too, no sense in getting stuck midway through a 365MB download.<br />
<br />
Yes, must have a minstrel as the only other healing class (Captain) wont cut it.  But, Minstrels are fun to play and can solo and all that so they are not a boring class.<br />
<br />
This is a questing game, a small group game, and a stop and smell the roses game.  MMO-lyte here, and you cannot avoid that.  If you try to play it any other way you will not enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Its very basic when you compare it to EQ2s combat, or AC1 early SWG skill system, or AC1 loot system, or EQ1 community (so far)...but that looks to be a design decision.  They have a nice foundation and a lot of room for expansions.<br />
<br />
I didnt like any Turbine games and thought they were all not well thought out or designed, but this game might be their ice breaker.<br />
<br />
If you go about this game with the mindset of an explorer you will enjoy it, think of it in terms or raids or racing to the highest level and you wont.</div></div><hr />

I'll try to do some more graphic comparisons now that I am higher level and can get around to more scenic and higher level places.<br />

There's wizard hats.  I have one :-P even though I'm a hunter.  They're called pointy hats.</div></div><hr />

But...its stress test which means you will be crashing and lagging your way through the Shire if you can even get out that far (though the game is remarkably stable so far).<br />
<br />
<br />
Open Beat starts in March I think, and you cannot get into closed Morth American Beta anymore (unless you applied a while back and they are late sending you the confirm reply).<br />
<br />
Try Codemasters, which is the Euro Beta.  They were giving away like 8k Beta invites a week ago, the sole Euro Server seems very sparse so there might be some openings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matheren</div><div class="date">02-22-07, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strange, but I've definitely experienced the memory leak issue, although it seems way more prevalent for my Man &amp; Hobbit characters in Archet. I can run around on my elf for a good amount of time with no issue, but as soon as I'm in Archet and enter/exit a door area (or have seemingly loaded enough character models), the jerky slowdown hits big time.<br />
<br />
And this is on a brand new machine that could run Vanguard on higher settings without a hitch :/</div></div><hr />

It's not anything groundbreaking, but it's bound to be better than WoW simply to avoid all the asshattery that goes on with the b.net f***sticks (nothing personal if you are one).<br />

It is a great game and I'm enjoying it alot, even sitting at the cap waiting for the full release.  Quite frankly I'm surpised how much I enjoy the game; the graphics are great, game runs very smooth at max settings, the combat is fun, built in voice chat works good, and I really enjoy my class (Champion).  I tried Vanguard earlier this year; this game is 10x more fun and smooth.  Vanguard likely lowered my standards for MMOs, but I really feel this is a fun game with lots of potential.  I'm preordering it before the 24th for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have the crash bug for some reason, when i run at higher then 1024x768 resolution i crash every 15 minutes. have to reboot my system.<br />
<br />
I know alot of people have a crash issue, i am not sure if its due to the low res client for the open beta/world tour. Last fall during closed beta i rarely had any crash problems.<br />
<br />
The game really is in alot of respects an expanded better version of DDO, however they did alot better job with content. Its not a hard game by any means, but what it does, it does well, and is going for the mass market appeal. <br />
<br />
Pre-order + cost savings on the monthly charge is a nice bit of marketing as well. I am picking it up with a few friends, who still play wow, as a filler game once or twice a week. The lack of pvp, or isolation of pvp into instances only is a bit annoying to me personally. <br />
<br />
Unless turbene pumps out content like mad, i dont see alot of long term potential for LOTRO, as you will hit 50 in about 8 days played or so.</div></div><hr />

I just played it for 3 or so hours.. fun so far! Really wondering how much content is in this game, though, to decide if it will be worth purchasing.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why, but I can't get enough of it.  I had a human champion that I got to 15 and he was a ton of fun.  Recently I made a hobbit burglar and OMG are they awesome.  It wasn't until lvl 10 that I actually started becoming powerful but now at 14 I am a beast.  I don't think burglars can do as much damage as champions or hunters, but their abilities make up for it ( can sap enemies in the middle of a fight, can trigger fellowship attacks on a 5 min cooldown, etc.).  I just learned to burgle but haven't gotten around to stealing anything, yet ;).  I am in a pretty awesome kinship on Nimrodel so if you get the game, send Aspo a tell and I'll get you in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suldaien</div><div class="date">04-18-07, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's not really a traditional ROGUE class for LoTRO as far as  I'm concerned. Burglars are debuffers that do medium damage and have stealth. Champions are the melee-dps kings but they can't stealth(unless they're an elf with the sylvan shadows racial trait equipped) and the top dps in-game atm HANDS DOWN are hunters. So I departed from my Rogue-only lifestyle(EQ1 - Rogue, EQ2 - Assassin, WoW - Rogue) and made a guardian - couldn't be happier.</div></div><hr />

However, I think ranged dps is lame so I decided not to be a hunter.  I like the champion alot, but being a hobbit burglar has just been a ton more fun so far.  I was under the impression that burglars are actually on par with champions as far as dps is concerned.  My burglar, who has crappy armor and weaps, isn't doing THAT much less damage than my champion, who has the best items and weaps you can get before lvl 15.  I would advise playing both classes to 15 and see which one you like more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teleri</div><div class="date">04-20-07, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the memory leak problem looks to be as bad than Vanguard's, but the graphics of this game are a lot better than VG's on the grounds that people don't look like they were made in the DOOM III engine (read: like plastic). The game also runs ten times smoother than what VG did for me (I didn't even have VG's stuff maxed out) and I havent seen any graphic problems come up either (VG had the problem of having one of the graphic options turned on and causing the entire screen to go black when you went underwater).<br />
<br />
First, most of the memory leaks in VG seem to have been fixed as I have not crashed in over a month.  The map use to give me fits but have had no issues in a long long time now.<br />
<br />
Second, if you have the video card for it the models in VG don’t look at all plastic at all and the animation is smooth and realistic.  Its VGs downfall that you have to have a higher end system to really be able to appreciate the art in that game.  <br />
<br />
Third, I run WoW, Vanguard and the LOTRO all with the graphics maxed (though with lowish FPS in VG) and if you guys really think LOTRO has better graphics/style than WoW you really have some blinders on.  I am honestly shocked to even see a good review of the graphics.<br />
<br />
You can debate till your blue in the face about the styles of WoW vs VG… but LOTR is a clear looser.  To each there own I guess.</div></div><hr />

Dwarves cannot be Burglers in this game so my main is a Guardian. I did make a hobbit Burgler in closed beta and leveld him up to level 27. Burglers don't really shine untill their mid 20s. <br />
<br />
They are really fun to play as they have a diverse bag of tricks. They are able to pose a riddle (mez) to humanoid mobs and it last long enough to kill another mob while the other awaits your convience. They get a self heal at level 10 that helps a lot with their survivability. There is a &quot;crit now&quot; button on a 90 second timer and they get the &quot;Diversion&quot; skill at 18. &quot;Touch and Go&quot; at level 6 is a &quot;nimble&quot; on a 5 min timer.<br />
<br />
Skills/levels listed here ( http://www.lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Burglar ).<br />
<br />
Burgs are really welcome to groups because they have multiple methods of starting conjunctions which are &quot;group attacks&quot; that can do massive damage, cure the group, restore the group's power or combinations of those abilities.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Burgle&quot; skill at 14 is picking pockets. Any loot aquired this way comes from a seperate table and is often quite respectable. I've burgled a few purple items and a respectable ammount of yellows.<br />
<br />
I've not experienced the memory leak issue since open beta started. The game is very polished and a lot deeper than it looks on the surface. Yes, there is no grinding, unless you actually want a fully fleshed out character. You can level easily enough but many traits (consider them AAs) require extra time.<br />
<br />
The time I spent &quot;grinding&quot; traits in closed beta didn't really feel like grinding. In the process of gathering resourses for my trades I would get quests to kill the mobs I had to kill for my traits and then go gather resourses in areas that those mobs lived. I was able to kill several birds with the same stones that way.<br />
<br />
I agree that this isn't a powergamer's game and fervently hope that it dosen't become one. It's an exploration game. I cannot begin to tell you how wonderful it felt when I was just wandering the Trollshaws in my never ending quest for ores, woods and hides and I just happened to stumble into the Stone-troll's Glade (from The Hobbit).<br />
