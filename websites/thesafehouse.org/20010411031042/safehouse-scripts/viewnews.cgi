Today I put an order in for a dedicated web server for The Safehouse.<br>The current server we are on has a few issues that just became known to us. The biggest one being that the server is designed to only allow 20 simultaneous processes.<br>What that means in layman&#8217;s terms is that only 20 requests for any single item (page, graphic, database query) can take place at any given time. This is causing the lag issues we are currently dealing with. (Anyone who reads Lum the Mad may also be aware that he is experiencing the identical problem, this is because we have the same solution from the same service provider.)<br><br>The new server is completely dedicated to my hosting company and the Safehouse. The performance WILL increase, this I promise. This will also allow us to do many more things we have wanted to do.<br><br>The time frame for this to take place will be over the next couple of weeks. The new server will be available to me no later than Monday, then im estimating at least a week for setup and cutover form the old site.<br><br>The Safehouse staff asks that you bear with us while we make the move over.<br><br>Thank you all,<br><br>Aidden &<br>The Safehouse Staff.<br></font></blockquote><hr noshade color="000000" align="left" width="50%">
