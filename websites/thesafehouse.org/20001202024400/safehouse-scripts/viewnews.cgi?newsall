<strong><font color="#ff0000">Patch message - Wed Nov 29th</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, November 29, 2000 by <a href="mailto:zato@thesafehouse.org">Zato</a></small><br><blockquote>November 29th, 3:00am <br>------------------------------ <br><br>*Patch Day* <br><br>Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues: <br><br>- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum. Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction. <br><br>- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC. The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters. As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type. For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything. <br><br>- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes. For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue. <br><br>- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards. Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it. <br><br>- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in. <br><br>- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled. Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted. <br><br>- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace". This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game. <br><br>- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances. There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future. <br><br>- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while. <br><br>- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons. The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability. It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <br><br>- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant. Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune. <br><br>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill. <br><br>Remember! Only a few days left until the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious. Reserve your copy at your local retailer today! <br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Patch for November 21, 2000</font> </strong><small>Posted Tuesday, November 21, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>November 21st, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last week's big patch. The following changes were made:<br><br>- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or below the minimum.<br>- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified whenever the volume slider was moved.<br>- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association with mipmapping.<br>- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the wrong slot.<br>- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those carried by dwarves. <br>- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of experience in slight disagreement with the server.<br>- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that would do around one million points of damage if left to its own devices.<br>- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable. <br><br>In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following the patch today. Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune. We would have named the new server under its full name if not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing "Bristlebane" server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team </blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Patch message for November 16, 2000</font> </strong><small>Posted Thursday, November 16, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>November 16th, 8:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Follow-up Patch*<br><br>Today's follow-up patch addresses the following issues from yesterday's patch:<br><br>- The spell Torpor received an unintentional reduction in effectiveness<br>- Illumination in game was not as bright as it should have been. <br>- Pet using classes unintentionally gained the ability to summon multiple pets.<br>- Bard songs were reacting poorly with invisibility/hide/sneak.<br>- Hitpoints were being reported incorrectly to clients.<br>- Changing resolutions would cause some to crash.<br><br>In addition, the following changes were left out of yesterday's patch message:<br><br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some to not be able to cast after being feared. <br>- Data for group members and targets will be updated more frequently. This change should reduce complaints of warping and slow hitpoint and other updates.<br>- Bards received increases in the skill cap for their instrument skills.<br>- Changed the default combo for casting spells from CTRL-1:8 to ALT-1:8, as CTRL was interfering with players ability to strafe.<br><br>Thank you for your continued patience.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team </blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Patch Message for November 15, 2000</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, November 15, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>***Patch Day***<br><br>Today's patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included with DirectX 7. You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play EverQuest. Please refer to everquest.station.sony.co...ents.shtml prior to contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting technical support.<br><br>Today's patch also includes the new "Sound Engine" that we've been speaking about for some time. The new sound engine supports additional EAX features and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the past.<br><br>*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<br><br>The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT- to Midnight. All players wishing to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those servers to the new split-server should execute "/movelog yes" during the windows.<br><br>The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or Wednesday. Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for a firm time when it is decided. Remember that corpses will not follow you to the new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all corpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move. <br><br>As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during the window. You will need to be present and execute the command in order to move.<br><br>*Spell Changes*<br><br>-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<br>-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing the secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<br>-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item. The effect was checking resist on each tick instead of running full course.<br>-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<br>-- Fixed the "Modulating Rod" so that it can be used by the appropriate races.<br>-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<br>-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength spell.<br>-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately with other spells that have similar effects.<br><br>-- Modified the "Jonathan's" line of songs to remove the "skin" effect in order to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat. In addition, we made them "Self Only" spells rather than "Single Target" spells in order to allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.<br><br>*General Fixes/Changes*<br><br>-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on "Sister's Isle" to attack people who were fighting pirates.<br>-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game since they do not have the piercing skill.<br>-- The "Belt of the River" quest should now work correctly.<br>-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<br>-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<br>-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items. Please check your items to see your changes. Note: Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<br>-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the correct loot.<br>-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<br>-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<br>-- Made the "Gravebinder" a magic weapon.<br><br>-- Repaired the Forager Bag. It was causing people to lose weight when placing items in the bag. It is supposed to have a weight reduction component, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.<br><br>-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50. Previously, creatures above level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill. Now, most creatures below the character's level can now be successfully taunted. As a note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that of a creature below 50th.<br><br><br>*Client Enhancements*<br><br>-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<br>-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total number of available socials by 108.<br>-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate incorrectly.<br>-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at higher resolutions.<br>-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider. Users should now see differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an adjustable clipping plane.<br><br>-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show "[LD]" over their heads when linkdead. In addition, these same players will no longer show as "LinkDead" in the /who list.<br><br>-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game. /usercolor: Usage "/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B" where "UserColorNumber is the number of the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red, green and blue respectively. All changes will be automatically saved to your EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the character name indicating the server number. As such, you will now be able to have characters of the same name on two separate servers with different custom options.<br><br>-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and character name. For instance, if your character is named "Bobb", and you are on Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<br><br>-- Added two new entries to the "Defaults" section of the EQCLIENT.INI file: AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on automatically when assisting. Defaults to "TRUE". ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the "Soandso is inspecting you" message. Defaults to "TRUE".<br><br>-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced. You can now set two keys, a primary and an alternate, for each function in game. In addition, things that were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your preference. Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key, right-click to set the secondary.<br><br>-- Added the /note command. /note will append the following text to a file called "notes.txt" in your EverQuest directory. For instance, typing "/note This is a note" will put "This is a note" on the next line in the notes.txt file.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team </blockquote><hr>

In fact, it&#8217;s been nearly a year since I began representing the company to the players, and in return, the players to the company. <br><br>We&#8217;ve certainly had some bumps in the road, but overall I think that the development team and the community of players have grown much closer over the past year. We&#8217;ve addressed a lot of issues, solved a number of problems, and overall improved the game as a result of our relationship. We now have more development team members posting on the boards than ever before and our response time to issues in game has dropped dramatically. Furthermore, we&#8217;ve become much more flexible in terms of addressing everyone&#8217;s issues. We&#8217;ve seen a number of old bugs addressed, and implemented numerous enhancements, both those related to a particular class, and to the players as a whole. <br><br>Many of you have noticed that I&#8217;ve been around a little less than normal over the past couple of weeks. Some have gotten the impression that we&#8217;d become less resilient in our goal to maintain a strong community. I can now let everyone know that this is not the case, that our commitment to our players is stronger than ever, and that we remain committed to continually improving our relationship with EverQuest players.<br><br>Today I am pleased to announce that Alan &#8220;Absor&#8221; VanCouvering, formerly of EverQuest Express (eqx.simplenet.com), has joined the EverQuest Team. Alan will be taking over my position as Community Relations Manager of EverQuest, and will be responsible for taking our community relations to the next level. Alan has been the editor of EverQuest Express since early beta, and comes to us with nearly 10 years of customer service experience. Please make him feel at home and take it easy on him until he comes up to speed. Alan has posted an introduction below.<br><br>With Alan coming on, I&#8217;ve moved to the development team as Associate Producer of EQLive and the Scars of Velious, under Jeff Butler. I&#8217;ll be concentrating more on the &#8220;Live&#8221; side of things, with coordination of day-to-day operations of EverQuest being among my responsibilities. I&#8217;ll still stop by the boards from time to time, as they remain an excellent resource for information and player feedback, but Alan will be your point-man there. While I&#8217;m proud of the work we&#8217;ve done over the past year, I&#8217;m very excited about this new opportunity, and am equally glad that we were able to bring Alan on.<br><br>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address your concerns and making me a part of your EverQuest experience. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Gordon &#8220;Abashi&#8221; Wrinn<br>Associate Producer, EQLive and the Scars of Velious<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.<br><br>-------<br><br>Hello everyone.<br><br>My name is Alan VanCouvering. As Gordon mentioned, I will be taking over as Community Relations Manager for EverQuest here at Verant Interactive, Inc.<br><br>Let me start by giving you an idea what it is that I will be doing under the auspice of the wordy title &#8220;Community Relations Manager&#8221;. It will be my job to understand the players&#8217; concerns about EverQuest and to get those concerns to the development team. It will also be my job to get responses to those concerns back to the players and to help the development team to speak with the community. There will be other tasks (I imagine there will be loads of other tasks), but that&#8217;s my primary job.<br><br>Until recently, very recently, I&#8217;ve been a player. I have been involved with EverQuest as a tester and a&#8230; commentator about the game since the early beta. Some of you may know me as Absor from EverQuest Express. I&#8217;m not going to claim to know everything that there is to know about the game. I don&#8217;t know where all the problems lie, and I don&#8217;t know all the good things. Of course I will be trying to absorb everything that I can from the designers here and from the players. But let me apologize now if I don&#8217;t know all the answers to your questions.<br><br>I hope that you will bring your concerns to me so that I can understand them. Don&#8217;t be afraid to over-explain something to me. And don&#8217;t be too surprised if I ask for clarifications on a point or two. I haven&#8217;t played all the classes to 60th level, so I may not understand the problems with &#8220;x&#8221; item or &#8220;y&#8221; class from personal experience. I am, however, certain that I can understand them if they are explained to me.<br><br>I&#8217;ve also learned that I have a somewhat conversational style when writing for public consumption. I hope that this doesn&#8217;t make me seem less professional to any of you. I promise you that I take my work seriously. I just find that I communicate better this way, and my job is all about communicating.<br><br>As a fan of EverQuest this job is a wonderful opportunity for me.

<strong><font color="#ff0000">EQ will be upgraded to DirectX 7.0a</font> </strong><small>Posted Thursday, October 5, 2000 by <a href="mailto:zato@thesafehouse.org">Zato</a></small><br><blockquote>Abashi had this to say on the EQ Discussion forums.<br><br>Hello all,<br>As many of you know, over the past couple of months we&#8217;ve made numerous enhancements to the EverQuest client. In addition to things such as new /-commands and other changes of that nature, we&#8217;ve enhanced the UI itself to allow moveable and resizable windows, among other things. At the same time we&#8217;ve been working on a brand new sound engine, and have been further concentrating on optimizing and expanding the capabilities of the EverQuest client.<br><br>For most applications, the feature set of a version of DirectX is limited to the lowest common denominator between the version that the software is compiled under, and the version running on the client. This means that though you may be running DirectX 7.0a already, and are receiving advantages associated with the more advanced code, the feature-set of DirectX used when in EverQuest is limited to version 5.2.<br><br>This limits the type and breadth of enhancements that can be made to the client. Given that we feel that EverQuest players would enjoy continuing to see new enhancements for the client, we will soon begin compiling the client under DirectX 7.0a, and implementing the feature-set available within that version. When we do this, everyone will need DirectX 7.0a (or higher) to play EverQuest. <br><br>Here are some of the possible benefits from DirectX 7.0a:<br><br>- Better performance (Graphics and Sound)<br>- Gamma Correction working in D3D <br>- Proper Mip-Mapping in D3D <br>- Fixes fogging on some cards. (Some cards have no fogging at all and look pretty bad) <br>- Allows us to use newer interfaces to support such features as full-screen anti-aliasing, and alternate Z-buffering methods, which tend to look better.<br><br>Changing to DX7 does have a potential downside. Those using older or discontinued video or sound cards that do not have DX7 compatible drivers may need to upgrade to continue playing. However, we feel that the benefits that will come from upgrading to this newer version of DirectX outweigh the potential problems.<br><br>We plan to begin requiring DirectX7.0a when the EverQuest client is next patched, in two or three weeks. We wanted to be sure to give everyone enough time to check their version of DirectX and install the newest version. You can run DXDIAG.EXE in your Windows\System directory to check your DirectX version and get the newest version of DirectX from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">http://www.microsoft.com/directx</a> if it is needed.<br><br>Please keep an eye on the patch message for further information regarding the planned implementation of DX7.<br><br>-Gordon</blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Patch message for September 28, 2000</font> </strong><small>Posted Thursday, September 28, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>***Patch Day***<br><br>The following changes have been implemented on the production servers as part of today's patch:<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>- NPC corpses level 55 or over will now last 30 minutes before decaying. This should help those on large multi-group encounters who need some prep-time before looting items.<br>- The item "Woe" has been repaired. If you receive the "Item out of charges" message when your "Woe" attempts to fire its spell, please contact a GM to trade out the item.<br>- The spell "Mark of Karn" has been changed. The recast-time has been reduced significantly and the Hitpoint-return is now scaled inversely based upon the delay of the weapon. In addition, a hitpoint return will only take place when the target is hit with a primary melee weapon, or the primary hand if you are unarmed.<br>- Some more tradeskill component vendors have been placed within the world to make certain tradeskills easier to use in your home town.<br>- "AFK" and "LD" status will now be reported above player's heads.<br><br>*Fleeing NPCs*<br><br>Last week's patch caused NPCs to flee more than before due to a bug that was fixed. After evaluating the situation, we decided to reduce the chance to flee, but not to the extent that it was reduced before. NPCs were previously much more "brave" than they should have been.<br><br>As part of the same change, charmed NPCs also began fleeing when low on health. We've determined that this is not a good situation for the players. As such, we have stopped charmed creatures from fleeing per player request.<br><br>*Level 1 Character Purge*<br><br>The Level 1 character purge has been completed. All level 1 characters that have not been played within the past 30 days have been deleted.<br><br>*New Server Active*<br><br>Tholuxe Paells, a new server open to new characters only, is now active and ready for play. Enjoy! As a reminder, /movelog registration will take place on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare Friday evening from 6PM to Midnight (PDT: GMT-7). Registered characters will be moved to a second new server, Drinal, early next week.<br><br>***User Interface Changes***<br><br>Many UI enhancements were made in today's patch:<br><br>*Moving and Resizing Windows*<br><br>The data windows in the full screen "HUD" mode may now be moved by clicking in the upper left-hand corner, moving them to where you want, then clicking again. The "spell effect" and "chat" windows can be resized by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the appropriate size, and then clicking again. Coordinates for window locations in each resolution are stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>*Bugs with Several Commands Fixed*<br><br>We fixed a problem with /book, /sit, and /doability that allowed them to be executed at inappropriate times, such as while charmed or feared. They should now only function when the native button would have functioned if pressed.<br><br>*Miscellaneous Additions*<br><br>Added the following /-commands:<br><br>- /camp: Causes your character to camp out. You must be sitting to use /camp.<br>- /disband: Will disband you from your current group, or turn down an invitation to join another group.<br>- /invite: Will invite the target into a group, or accept an invitation if one is pending.<br>- /attack: Will toggle the state of "Auto-attack". You may also add a parameter of "on" or "off" to explicitly set the state.<br><br>In addition:<br><br>- CTRL-1 through CTRL-8 will cast the spell in the specified spell-slot.<br>- ":" (colon: Short for /emote) and "'" (apostrophe: Short for /say) will now bring up the chat line in the same fashion as the /-key and ENTER.<br>- The "R" key (by default) takes you into reply-mode as always, bringing up a reply to the last person sending you a /tell. However, you can now TAB and SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the last 10 people that have sent you /tells. <br><br>*Pauses in Socials*<br><br>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command. /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause). <br><br>For example, a social consisting of:<br><br>/sit off<br>/cast 1<br>/pause 100<br>/sit on<br><br>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br><br>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.<br><br>For example:<br><br>/sit off<br>/pause 100,/cast 1<br>/sit on<br><br>...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line. <br><br>*Emote Codes*<br><br>The @ symbol has been replaced with a series of %-codes that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in ALL chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild). <br><br>The new %-codes are: <br><br>%T - Returns the current target.<br>%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<br>%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<br>%P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<br>%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).<br><br>For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote:<br><br>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.<br><br>...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><A HREF="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=1838.topic">Click here to discuss the patch</A></blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">PATCH Day!</font> </strong><small>Posted Tuesday, September 19, 2000 by <a href="mailto:shadowcross@thesafehouse.org">Shadowcross</a></small><br><blockquote>September 19th, 7:00am<br>------------------------<br>*Level 1 Character Purge*<br><br>The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7). Any level 1 characters that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted. If you wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27. <br><br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content for EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many* content-additions to the game. <br><br>*New Epic Quests*<br><br>We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new "Fiery Avenger" style quests for every class in the game (including paladins). The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.<br><br>Good luck to everyone on your quest.<br><br>*Class Issues*<br><br>Rangers:<br><br>Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills for all melee-centric classes. In the course of these tests we determined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended level, and have made the following changes:<br><br>- The "Jolt" spell has had its casting time reduced.<br>- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<br><br>Monks:<br><br>High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty. The additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<br><br>Cleric:<br><br>Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are incompatible with that configuration. We have therefore removed the cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<br><br>After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction. This spell's current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group. As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its "heal per hit" value decreased. <br><br><br>*Fungal Regrowth*<br><br>"Fungal Regrowth" is now a self-only spell. It was being used as an offensive spell by virtue of its "snare" effect upon the target. Furthermore, we ruled out making it "group only" as with other spells that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern. The spell was reducing the group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative magic.<br><br><br>*Attack Speed Buffs*<br><br>In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any "Haste" item combined with any "Haste" spell to automatically yield maximum haste, regardless of the level of "Haste" granted by each individual component. This fix increases the usefulness of better "Haste" equipment and spells. The downside to this is that those who usually have both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.<br><br><br>*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*<br><br>Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to address disparities in risk and reward. For the most part, the quality of the "common" loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the "rares" from Sebilis.<br><br><br>*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*<br><br>In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay weapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand. Included in this change are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip. The delay on these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary hand made these weapons much too powerful for their availability and the risk associated with their acquisition.<br><br>In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified. The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created a problem similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has been increased.<br><br><br>*Server Selection Screen*<br><br>It has come to our attention that new players often think that the high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if everyone else is there, it must be a good server. However, in Massively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often considered superior for gameplay. Therefore we have marked servers that would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing them in "green" in the server selection window. The preferred servers have populations such that an influx of new people would benefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.<br><br><br>*Custom Emotes and AFK*<br><br>Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Baobob", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" as the target. For instance: <br><br>/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it. <br><br>...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text output will be: "CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it." <br><br>Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK. Type "/AFK <message>" (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK message. For instance, if you type "/afk Grabbing a snack", you will reply with "Grabbing a snack" when someone sends you a /tell.<br><br><br>*Skill Gain*<br><br>The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character stats. This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain skills to improve at a greater rate.<br><br><br>*Trade Skills Enhanced*<br><br>Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging items, and other things to be discovered once in game. <br><br>In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented. Players will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills. This includes: <br><br>- Baking<br>- Blacksmithing<br>- Brewing<br>- Jewelcraft<br>- Tailoring<br>- Fletching<br>- Pottery <br><br>Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to exceed 200. Specialization restrictions do not include class or race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering. Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally available trade skill. <br><br>The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project. Further enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Join the discussion in our forums <a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=1804.topic">here!</a></blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Rules and dates for the "King of Thieves" Contest!</font> </strong><small>Posted Monday, September 18, 2000 by <a href="mailto:shadowcross@thesafehouse.org">Shadowcross</a></small><br><blockquote>I have given much thought to the event my noted rogues, and I am sorry to state that I cannot come up with an event that will truly test all of the skills that make a rogue as versatile as the profession is.<br>This saddens me, because with a profession as capable in so many different aspects of life, we will only be able to test those skills that define the combat capabilities that each of you possess.<br><br>Pickpocket of another character has been disallowed by the gods, therefore would require those individuals that tend to be out of control of the avatars of Norrath. Anytime you are dealing with these beings (NPC) many things can and usually go wrong.<br><br>Poisons are a trademark of the rogues, and I have only one request on the topic, this being that no blindness poisons are applied and used against each other. This is to ensure that the matches are based on true skill and trickery, not a false trickery granted by a poison.<br><br>Pick Locks, while a needed skill in some of the greatest dungeons in the realm, are far away from the Arena that we hold the events in. This also holds true for Sense and Disarm traps, which are hundreds of miles from the arena zone.<br><br>Instill Doubt has been requested to be disallowed by a council of rogues that met in the Arena this past week. After showing that a single success of this skill results in an undoubted win, it was outlawed from the event. This skill should not be considered &#8220;useless&#8221; by any means, just too strong to be using against each other in this duel.<br><br>Disarm, on the other hand, will be allowed in the event. It will take a quick hand to disarm a rogue in motion, and an even quicker hand to pull out another dagger from a nearby sheath. This skill cannot be ignored and will remain in the event.<br><br>Activateable items will be disallowed. Needless to say those bringing earrings that can lifetap, potions that can heal or negate poisons will negate damage done to them not out of skill, but out of the wealth of a rogue that can afford such luxuries. Items that have these abilities can still be worn, just not used.<br><br>Hide and Sneak is a no-win situation for the judges, contestants, and participants. If we allow hide and sneak, everyone who enters the ring will have see invis gear on so they can engage their opponent at all times. The only thing hide and sneak will accomplish is to take away the event from the crowd who has come to see the greatest rogues fight each other. <br><br>Therefore we are going to disallow hide and sneak in this event so that the rogues can wear items that will allow them to increase their combat efficiency and allow everyone to see the great action.<br><br>Backstabbing is allowed and encouraged. Since this is normally the most damage that a rogue can do to an opponent, of course it will be allowed.<br><br>The use of ranged weapons for the rogues is another profession defining ability. I must state that the bow is not allowed, but other weapons of ranged attacks will be granted. Also be advised that &#8216;kiting&#8217; will not be allowed. <br><br>This leaves a lot of room for interpretation of this statement, so I will make an all encompassing rule that states you can only attack via range once, then reengage with melee. Now if you wish to throw a dagger, melee once, back off, throw another dagger, that is allowed. As long as there is melee between the ranged attacks, you may engage as much as you desire.<br><br>There was a rule with the warriors, which stated they must face each other at all times in combat, therefore not allowing for &#8220;Constructive Fleeing&#8221;. If you wish to turn your back on a fellow rogue, knowing full well their capabilities of attacks from the back, both melee and ranged, you may do so. I expect low life expectancy for those who turn their backs to a rogue, and highly advise against it.<br><br>(OOC) The rule of Link-Death has been reviewed, and it was determined to modify the standing of this rule. If you go Link-Dead and are losing, you forfeit the match. If you go Link-Dead and are winning the match, the battle will be reviewed by the GM for a rematch. The option of disqualifying the Link-Dead player is still given to the judge, even if winning, but the Judge has the option to call for a rematch now.<br><br>These are the current rules of the event, and I assure you that they are still open for discussion and revision up to the point of the first match (Prexus &#8211; Wed at 5pm). I have worked with many rogues to try to find another event that will fit within time restraints so all servers can run them, that spectators can watch the glorious event, and that are fair to the profession that is involved.<br><br>Good luck to the Rogues, we shall see you at the event!<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Event Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive<br><br>9/20 at 5pm - Prexus<br>9/21 at 5pm - Erollisi Marr<br>9/21 at 5pm - Torvonnilious <br>9/21 at 6pm - Luclin<br>9/22 at 5pm - The Rathe<br>9/22 at 6pm - Povar<br><br>9/23 at 3pm - Vallon Zek<br>9/23 at 4pm - Mithaniel Marr <br>9/23 at 5pm - Xegony <br>9/23 at 6pm - Lanys <br>9/23 at 8pm - Innoruuk<br><br>9/24 at 3pm - Tarew Marr<br>9/24 at 5pm - Cazic Thule <br>9/24 at 6pm - Fennin Ro <br>9/24 at 6pm - E'ci <br>9/24 at 6pm - Brell<br><br>9/25 at 4pm - Solusek Ro<br>9/25 at 5pm - Veeshan <br><br>9/26 at 5pm - Terris Thule<br><br>9/27 at 4pm - Karana <br>9/27 at 5pm - Rallos Zek<br><br>9/28 at 2pm - Tallon Zek<br>9/28 at 6pm - Druzzil<br><br>9/29 at 6pm - Quellious<br>9/29 at 6pm - 7th Hammer <br>9/29 at 6pm - Sayryn <br>9/29 at 6pm - Morel <br>9/29 at 6pm - Nameless <br><br>9/30 at 6pm - Bristlebane<br>9/30 at 6pm - Tunare <br>9/30 at 6pm - Bertox <br>9/30 at 6pm - Rodcet <br>9/30 at 6pm - Tribunal<br><br>10/01 at Noon - Final on Test<br></blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">New Chat Expansion</font> </strong><small>Posted Thursday, September 14, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>Hello all,<br>I'm still trying to get together a list of changes for this Friday's patch and will have final data tomorrow, but either that one or the one after will include some new features in the in-game chat channels.<br><br>In the last patch, we implemented the ability to expand the "@" symbol into the targets name when used in an emote. There was a problem with this implementation that will be fixed in the new one. However, the @ symbol has been replaced with a series of @-variables that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in all chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild).<br><br>The new @-variables are:<br><br>@T - Returns the current target<br>@S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It)<br>@O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It)<br>@P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its)<br>@R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters)<br>@C - Returns the class of the target (only works on Player characters)<br><br>Furthermore, animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Abashi", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" (getting a bit complicated now, sorry). For instance, if my current target is "a gnoll", and I were to type:<br><br>/point say points at @T, indicating that he is ready to kill @O.<br><br>...my character would execute the /point animation, and the text output would be:<br><br>"Abashi points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it."<br><br>Custom text for canned animations must be directed at a target named "say".<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Trade Skills above 200</font> </strong><small>Posted Thursday, September 14, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>Hello all,<br><br>This Friday's patch will includes updates to the tradeskills in game. This doesn't yet represent a final revision, but is the big step necessary to get to the point where we can call them all "revamped". <br><br>As part of this update, we are including trade specialization. Players will only be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills. This includes:<br><br>Baking<br>Blacksmithing<br>Brewing<br>Jewelcraft<br>Tailoring<br>Fletching<br>Pottery<br><br>Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to exceed 200. This does not include class or race-specific tradeskills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering. <br><br>-Gordon<br></blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Guild Cleanup</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, September 13, 2000 by <a href="mailto:kezzek@thesafehouse.org">Kezzek</a></small><br><blockquote>It appears Verant is going to do a little guild housekeeping.  From the patch message:<br><br><i>September 12th, 3:00pm<br>------------------------<br><br>*Guild Maintenance*<br><br>We are in the process of preparing to do maintenance on the guild database. To that end, guild creation and activation will be on hold for the next three weeks. After that time, we may be running a process to remove inactive or under-subscribed guilds from the system. We would ask and recommend that those in guilds with under 10 separate members (on separate accounts) consider merging and deleting the under-subscribed guild. <br><br>In addition, it's apparently become common practice for people wishing to register a guild to enter the chat server and advertise there for help creating the guild. This will no longer be permitted. People wishing to submit a guild must organize prior to entering the chat server. Advertising for assistance within the chat server could result in a short-term (24 hour) suspension for the account.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br>-----------------------</i><br><br>Join the hot debate in our forums <a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=11858.topic">here!</a><br></blockquote><hr>

<strong><font color="#ff0000">Corpse Decay Lengthened</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, September 13, 2000 by <a href="mailto:vaslin@thesafehouse.org">Vaslin</a></small><br><blockquote>I just got word that one of the things to be patched Friday will be a change to corpse decay for high level creatures.<br><br>NPCs corpses 55th level or above will decay in 30 minutes rather than 5. We ended up deciding to make this change due to the difficulty of getting the dead back into VP to collect their loot in light of it all going NODROP.
