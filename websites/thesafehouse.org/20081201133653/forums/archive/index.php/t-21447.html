<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tular Nodrop</div><div class="date">11-12-05, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten myself pretty excited about Vanguard lately. I haven't played an MMO seriously since '02 in EQ. I got to thinking about the glory days on the Quellious server, being in my rogue only guild The Shadowed Ones. Man I miss those days. Sure, I'm looking back at them through rose-tinted spectacles as there were some terrible times being a rogue but all-in-all they were good times. It'd be nice if we could get a group (or guild) together on a server when the game comes out but it's probably a little early for that now, plus I'm no good at organizing stuff like that.  <br />
<br />
So, I'm wondering who all back here at the Safehouse are going to be rogueing it up in Vanguard. I feel very attached to my rogue character ever since I started Tular so I'm definitely going rogue as my main.</div></div><hr />

What a den of theives, rogues and scoundrels!<br />

And spies, aassassins, cutthroats, pick pockets, brigands, swashbucklers, pirates, and...<br />
<br />
Ye get the idea.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to the Vanguard rogue. Plans are indeed early for playing on a particular unnamed server but I predict that no matter what server you're on there'll be a way for the rogues to stick together, just as in the past. :)</div></div><hr />

Hmm, well this one's a bit complicated. I think, since you were a convert to the rogue class, we'll let you live. We'd especially let you live if you played a tank or healer for us to group with. /nod</div></div><hr />

I really enjoyed the gameplay that DAOC rogues had to offer, even though I didn't find their rogues viable in the long run.  If Vanguard can deliver their rogues with a strong combination of speed, strategy, and skill then I will be hooked.<br />
<br />
On a side note their arcane caster classes are sounding fantastic.  I wish we knew as much about the rogue as we do the psionicist.</div></div><hr />

I have always played rogues in these games, starting with UO, and that will certainly not change with Vanguard.<br />

With combat being almost turn based (i know i know its not really but its a slower pace with more to think about its pretty close) ill have to really look at the two classes to see what i might play.</div></div><hr />

I was a rogue in EQ for 3 years before I made the mistake of getting attached to SWG.  I'm so looking forward to playing another fantasy rogue in Vanguard.  <br />
<br />
I doubt anyone remembers me from way back, but I was Crillan Kidneypoker on Bertox, then transferred to Terris-thule and joined the guild Valon.  I was in the guild Silent Hand on Bertox for a long time too and it was a rogue only guild.  I had some great times in that guild and in Valon.  <br />
<br />
The rogues in SWG just don't cut it(Smuggler) compared to fantasy rogues.  Add to the fact that it's been over 2 years and they've never added smuggling to the profession and you can see why I said it was a mistake to get attached to SWG.<br />
<br />
I can't wait until this game is released and hopefully I can beta test it.  I'm looking forward to getting back into the rogue outfit.</div></div><hr />

I guess it changed to EZ Crillan since it must have been converted from the older EZ boards or something.  I'll see if I can figure out the password and login under my old name.</div></div><hr />

You have to keep using your new account.</div></div><hr />

I didn't give it much thought at first but as I got going I found out there weren't that many of us which I kind of liked.  I had a rogue alt and always felt that bards were closely related to rogues in some round about way.  <br />
<br />
In games I will play what ever class that needs to be played.  Need a healer?  Fine.  Tank?  Can do. I will have some alts that I am interested in but will be what ever is best for what ever guild/group I play with.  <br />
<br />
So I will definately have some type of rogue but he may be superceeded depending on where I end up with a guild...</div></div><hr />

I suspect poisons might be a part of roguely life, I know folks have pushed it at Darrin (classes guy at Sigil) anyway. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome.  I'm hoping it will be useful and worthwhile so all rogues will pursue the poisons.  In EQ, it took a long time for poisons to start being cool and useful, but they ended up being fairly nice.</div></div><hr />

Initially I was excited about EQ2, hoping it would be like EQ1 was before the PoP &quot;ruined&quot; it for me.  Unfortunately, for me, it didn't live up to the hype and my character in EQ2 is semi-retired.<br />
<br />
As far as Rogueishness, I don't play an MMORPG that doesn't have Rogues.  I am first, last, and always a Rogue...<br />

<br />
Well since I made that post in this thread, it's been ok to confirm that yes the rogue will definitely have poisons, and also other toys :)<br />
<br />
The rogue report from Fanguard is coming up with much more details that Nenjin and I got from sitting down with Darrin.<br />
<br />
And a welcome to Krikit who has finally seen the light... er dark, and will be joining us in the rogue class :)  Also, good to see Toxed (nice personal photo pic) and a &quot;bienvenue&quot; to Kalok :)</div></div><hr />

To be entirely honest when I first heard of Vanguard the class that first attracted me was Ranger. I prefer to be support classes and I feel keeping my character safe isn't so bad.<br />
Now me and a few friends are planning on getting this game together and now I can't be woodelf because they're starting on a dif continent :P<br />
It just wouldn't be right to be a ranger with any other race..<br />
So to follow old traditions it'll be rogue for me as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korthuran</div><div class="date">02-25-06, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">went to wow after EQ and started a rogue, then so did everybody else, a billion little kids with a variation of backstab in their name taking up my group/raid slot made me roll a priest<br />
<br />
this of course has lead to mass death , seriously i dont know what those people were complaining about, im a rogue not a priest, they should be expecting to die with me at the helm, im a rogue, i make die, its what i do, it doesn't discriminate from npc to pc, my old EQ guildies could attest to that (&lt;3 the GoD golem event)<br />
<br />
i cant wait for vanguard to put the real rogues back at the top and get rid of the bnet twitch kiddies, i miss ring chat, i miss being one of the players, not just rogues, on the server that can solo some retardedly difficult mob considering our class and/or the placement of the mob, i miss sneaking down and duoing trak, or die trying...often, i especially miss knowing the full layout of the zone within 10 minutes of entering, i STILL know every EQ zone i spent any time in by heart, BRING BACK THE ROGUEISHNESS!  WoW has ruined the class, i will never again call a WoW rogue a rogue, it is henceforth forever known as a rouge, enjoy the makeup blizzard, you can make it look pretty but it aint the real thing, kinda like fake boobies</div></div><hr />

I started WoW as a Rogue, maxed it, and eventually played all the other classes up.  My EQ Rogue remains my favorite MMO char, and I'll definitely be playing a Rogue in Vanguard.<br />
<br />
It sounds like we've got lots of detail coming in our class with Vanguard, lots of things that we can individualize ourselves with.  WoW lacks that kind of detail.  How many times did you see a Night Elf and assume it was a Rogue? How many times were you wrong in that assumption? :-)<br />
<br />
I've been following the progress of Vanguard for several months, and now that it's getting closer to release, I'm enjoying the new information about it that they've been releasing.<br />
