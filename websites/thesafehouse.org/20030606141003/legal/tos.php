<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>The Safehouse Network, LLC</B> (&quot;The Company&quot;) agrees to furnish services to the Subscriber, subject to the following TOS (Terms of Service).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use of The Safehouse Network, LLC Service constitutes acceptance and agreement to The Safehouse Network, LLC's AUP as well as The Safehouse Network, LLC's TOS (Terms of Service).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All provisions of this contract are subject to the TOS (Terms of Service) of The Safehouse Network, LLC and AUP (Acceptable Use Policy). The AUP may be changed from time to time at the discretion of the Company. Subscriber understands that change to the AUP by the Company shall not be grounds for early contract termination or non-payment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Agreement shall be construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the state of California, county of Santa Clara applicable to contracts enforceable in that state. Venue will be Santa Clara County, California. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Disclosure to Law Enforcement: The AUP specifically prohibits the use of our service for illegal activities. Therefore, Subscriber agrees that the Company may disclose any and all subscriber information including assigned IP numbers, account history, account use, etc. to any law enforcement agent who makes a written request without further consent or notification to the Subscriber. In addition The Safehouse Network, LLC shall have the right to terminate all service set forth in this Agreement.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Service Rates</B>: Subscriber acknowledges that the nature of the service furnished and the initial rates and charges have been communicated to Subscriber. Subscriber is aware that the Company may prospectively change the specified rates and charges from time to time. The promotional offer is contingent upon Company achieving and maintaining its cost of service goals including but not limited to rates charged to company by its suppliers.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Payment:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Establishment of this service is dependent upon receipt by the Company of payment of stated charges. Subsequent payments are due on the anniversary date of the service plan for that plan's service. All accounts and services provided by The Safehouse Network, LLC are subject to the current tax rate as imposed by the City of Santa Clara, State of California which is currently 8.25%. 80% of the monthly service charge is subject to the 8.25% tax rate, while the remaining 20% of the monthly service charge is not taxed. 100% of the setup fee is subject to the 8.25% tax rate. The above applies to all accounts and services provided by The Safehouse Network, LLC.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Payments and Fees:</B> Credit cards that are declined for any reason are subject to a $1.00 declination fee. Service will be interrupted on accounts that reach 10 days past due. Service interrupted for nonpayment is subject to a $200 reconnect charge. Accounts not paid by due date are subject to a $7.95 late fee. Accounts that are not collectable by The Safehouse Network, LLC may be turned over to an outside collection agency for collection. If your account is turned over for collection, you agree to pay the company a &quot;Processing and Collection&quot; Fee of not less than $50 nor more than $150. If you desire to cancel your account, please follow the proper procedure to do this as outlined in this TOS.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Refund and Disputes:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> All payments to The Safehouse Network, LLC are nonrefundable. This includes the one time setup fee and subsequent charges regardless of usage. All overcharges or billing disputes must be reported within 60 days of the time the dispute occurred. If you dispute a charge to your credit card issuer that, in The Safehouse Network, LLC's sole discretion is a valid charge under the provisions of the TOS and /or AUP, you agree to pay The Safehouse Network, LLC an &quot;Administrative Fee&quot; of not less than $50 and not more than $150.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Failure to Pay:</B> The Company may temporarily deny service or terminate this Agreement upon the failure of Subscriber to pay charges when due. Such termination or denial will not relieve Subscriber of responsibility for the payment of all accrued charges, plus reasonable interest and any collection fees.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Account Cancellation:</B> All requests for canceling accounts must be made via email with at least 30 days notice but not more than 60 days prior notification and sent to to accountclose@thesafehouse.org Attn: Cancellations, or you may call 877-747-6483 (877-SHROGUE). You must have all account information to cancel.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Subscriber acknowledges that the service provided is of such a nature that service can be interrupted for many reasons other than the negligence of the company and that damages resulting from any interruption of service are difficult to ascertain. Therefore, subscriber agrees that the company shall not be liable for any damages arising from such causes beyond the direct and exclusive control of the company. Subscriber further acknowledges that the company's liability for its own negligence may not in any event exceed an amount equivalent to charges payable by subscriber for services during the period damages occurred. In no event shall the company be liable for any special or consequential damages, loss or injury.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>New Domain Accounts:</B> All new webhosting accounts involving new domains will be set up and entered into our DNS servers within 3 to 5 business days. Due to unforeseen complications, however, this process may sometimes require up to 7 business days. If the new domain is registered by the account holder, there will be no handling fee. If the domain is registered by The Safehouse Network, LLC,  on behalf of the account holder a handling fee will be incurred.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Transfer of Domains:</B> New webhosting accounts which involve the transfer of a domain from another provider to The Safehouse Network, LLC will require a minimum of seven (7) days to be set up and entered into our DNS servers. In some cases, such transfers may take up to sixty (60) days. Due to the unpredictable nature of the transfer process, no guarantees are made regarding the amount of time a specific transfer may take. If the transfer of the domain is done by The Safehouse Network, LLC on behalf of the account holder a handling fee will be incurred. If the customer cancels service during the transfer period for any reason, all charges are considered earned.</FONT></P>
