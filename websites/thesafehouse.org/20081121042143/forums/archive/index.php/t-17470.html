However, during the course of this week some things have changed. Over the past few days, many (if not all) of our Affiliates received offers to buy their sites from a third party that Sigil has no interest in dealing with. The offers, however, were quite high and some owners felt (understandably) that they could simply not refuse them. 	<br />
<br />
<br />
Recap of Events<br />
<br />
As many of you know, this is the latest in a series of events between game companies and IGE. Selling services such as IGE come to prominence with the growing popularity of EverQuest. IGE deals with selling in-game items, characters, game money, and game accounts. The vast majority of the time this activity is against the EULAs of the games in which these items and characters exist. This can be a sensitive issue to gamers because it brings the real world into the gaming world and has many repercussions.<br />
<br />
The Present<br />
<br />
Recent articles posted by GameSpot and Ogaming about IGE brought many long standing issues regarding the out-of-game sale of in-game items back to the forefront. Okratas followed up on these articles with additional questions specifically regarding some of the issues of concern to long time gamers. Some of the questions were not answered in full. Sigil, which had turned down a deal offered by IGE last year, then answered some of the additional questions in a public interview taking a stance against the secondary market.<br />
<br />
It was recently uncovered that IGE owns Ogaming, one of the sites which did the initial interview with IGE. The Age of Vanguard fansite then receives a buy offer from IGE and publicly posts the letter and their rejection. The latest news to come to light is that IGE has made offers to buy out other Vanguard affiliate sites. Some have accepted the offers and have therefore lost their affiliate status with Sigil. <br />
<br />
Sigil is the latest company to have to make tough choices based on their stance regarding IGE. We at The Safehouse respect the choice that Sigil has made and support it, and like Sigil, we find no fault in any choice made by our fellow affiliate site owners especially when that choice could very well be life changing.<br />
 <br />
The Safehouse<br />
<br />
The Safehouse has an illustrious five year history as a gaming site dedicated to the rogue class. It's a history of which staff and member alike are extremely proud, and at multiple points during that history we have been approached by members of the secondary market. We like to believe that this is due to our reputation as a quality gaming site. On each occassion that we were approached, we have made great effort to communicate that we are and will always remain in no way interested in selling to IGE. We have not been contacted recently about this matter by any secondary market vendors, and this is also something in which we take great pride. We hope this implies that our past replies on the subject were clear and understood. <br />
<br />
We look forward to our continued affiliation with Sigil Games Online and with the other game companies who provide us with the games we enjoy and the class we love to play. We also look forward to further developing relationships with other sites and services who have a positive impact on the MMOG community at large. However, we at The Safehouse do not view the secondary market contribution as a positive one and we will never sell to IGE.</div></div><hr />

Once it all hit mainstream though, there's no real way to pretend like it's not that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
I'm glad Sigil took a stand.  For not only this, but so many other things, I've never respected a company the way that I respect Sigil.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JookaWoo</div><div class="date">02-24-05, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im still trying to figure out why this press about sigil and ige is worthy of anything at all. Sigil has taken a fan site of its &quot;list&quot; of sites on there page, meaning in my mind absolutely nothing.  Have I visited there site? no, do I really care about whether they are there or not? no. In my mind this is all BS until the game is out or even in beta and then they really take a real action not some Pr BS to make them seem better than the rest. WoW made the same PR BS after release and you know what, they have done **** to stop the black market in MMO sales. its easy to talk **** and tell people one thing before you have a product on the market. Release the game and 'actually' do something then and i will respect you.</div></div><hr />

Looks like you do care enough to reply here though. You don't have to agree - nobody forces you to.<br />
<br />

<br />
This might not be newsworthy in your eyes, but it is in the eyes of the staff - and that's why it was posted.<br />
People not caring about or playing EQ2 probably don't think EQ2 patch messages are newsworthy, but others do - that's a fact for all news we post.<br />
<br />
Some will agree and others won't. Nothing big about it.</div></div><hr />

It probably helps that Sigil has Microsoft's attack lawyers on standby. I wonder how many of IGE's far eastern plat farming sweatshops are running pirated versions of Windows?  :evil</div></div><hr />

Couldn't find a direct link to the article, but it is titled &quot;Not For Sale&quot;<br />
<br />
Late last night, as the site manager for Vanguard Silky Venom, I was offered by email from ***EXPLETIVE DELETED***, Chief Strategic Officer of IGE, the sum of $85,000 to sell Vanguard Silky Venom to IGE. I was, to say the least, floored by this proposal. If you take a look at the Vanguard Silky Venom site, there are maybe a total of five news items altogether. The hit count for this not-even-launched site is perhaps as high as 12 hits a day—not 12,000, but 12. Very interesting (and faintly flattering) to be offered such a high sum for such a neophyte site, don't you think?<br />
<br />
That's for a budding young site. Granted, Raya the site administrator, has established herself in the Vanguard community, but we're talking grassroots content-light website at this point... for 85K?!?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully he will be able to actually make a stand against the &quot;secondary market&quot; unlike the others...ok I will grant that WoW is trying somewhat.<br />
<br />
I am very proud of our SH Leaders for making their stand :D</div></div><hr />
