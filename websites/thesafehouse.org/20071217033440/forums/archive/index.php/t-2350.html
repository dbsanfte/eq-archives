<br />
Going first, mine is Shino the Master of Bugs Ninja from Naruto.<br />
<br />
I picked him cause he looks cool.  Almost as cool as me.  I mean, check out that high collar man!  It's so high!!<br />

The control panel behind him is because he's sitting in a sub.  No pariticular reason why I chose that one, just the first decient pic I found of him while I was looking.<br />
<br />
I picked him because someone had asked me around the same time what Anime character I looked like.  JiGen was the closest I could think of.  <br />
No im not rail thin however, you dont see many anime characters with beards basiclly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I swiped mine from an older version of Miranda IM (http://miranda-im.org/). It's the &quot;Invisible&quot; status icon. I was going to have an artsy friend of mine clean it up for the higher resolution, but then I stuck with simply enlarging it and keeping the low resolution, for some sort of artsy effect. I guess it's my way of fighting the man or something. It's also the favicon for my website (http://www.invisibill.net/). It's fairly simple, but unique, which is how I like things.<br />
<br />
Going back a step further, &quot;InvisiBill&quot; comes from an ex-girlfriend's dad before I met either of them. My friend was dating the older sister and kept mentioning his friend Bill (nobody else in the family had met me yet). Their dad had a weird sense of humor, and asked if this friend was &quot;InvisiBill&quot;. It just stuck.</div></div><hr />

I forget why, but I decided to test my skill in MS Paint.  Started fooling around and decided to give him a hooded cloak too.  Then to get really savvy, I interchanged different shades of orange to make his hair look a little better than one plain block of orange.  I guess I use it because it represents me in game, and I've had it for a while so I'm not gonna change it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An assignment for whoever feels like it: Ezboard neatly managed to enlarge it to 60x60 pixels which was the maximum size there, but the original is 39x40 pixels, so it looks real small here without the autoenlargement. When I try to enlarge it to 78x80 or 80x80 in photoshop to use here, I get a white border on it that is almost impossible to get off without removing some of the actual picture and making it look goofy. I like the clean look it has right now, but would like for it to be twice the size. Anyone feel up to the task?</div></div><hr />

Bug is still a problem, but here is mine.<br />
<br />
I haved loved smurfs since the 80's.  I guess it was the community based appeal of the blue critters living under constant fear of a half ass lonely mage that had a even weaker cat and a dingy dirty castle.<br />
<br />
I always wanted to see the smurfs taken to the next level, but they never reached it.  Smurfs in space, smurfs on the moon, etc etc.  I think the next attempt was the Snorks, the colorful underwater dwellers but they were not enough.  Then somehow I started watching Jabber Jaw instead of the snorks.<br />
<br />
So FreonSmurf is one of the new smurf tribe of the year 80000.<br />
<br />
Add in the Boondocks which I identify with very closely on a personal and political level<br />
<br />
This was my dream for the longest...<br />
<br />
My photoshop skills suck, I went to the root cellar for help<br />
<br />
<br />
Nocte is the ****in man!  Its so awesome he made the sig for me.  It has become my all purpose avatar now.<br />

<br />
Hajime no Ippo, the anime (boo!).<br />
<br />
Ippo is like, the coolest person in the world or something. Every boxer he's ever fought has been injured to the point of not being able to fight again for years, or retired. A few notable exceptions, of course.<br />
<br />
I love Ippo, have been trying to read the manga but I'm only on vol. 54. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Anime's licensed to be released in US soon, if anyone's interested. I think it's called &quot;The Fighting Spirit&quot; or &quot;The First Step&quot;. It's a really good anime, one of my favorites.</div></div><hr />

err most of the people ippo fight come back , but they lose rank<br />

Actually, I'm referring to post-anime. The anime only covers to vol. 34 or so. He learns a move or two, one of which is called Tekken, which broke many ribs of a boxer and damaged him heavily internally.</div></div><hr />

(who, btw, generally has the same look in every MMORPG I've remade her in)<br />
<br />
Other ones I've used include:<br />
<br />
http://pearll.homestead.com/files/knucklesrouge.jpg<br />
Knuckles and Rouge from Sonic Adventure standing beside the Master Emerald.  (What can I say?  I've always loved that series, and those characters are my favorites, despite the terrible voice acting.)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://pearll.homestead.com/files/Statue.gif<br />
One of the two demon statues from the first Ninja Gaiden game.  You can almost sense the evil eminating from the sprite of this relic.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://pearll.homestead.com/files/LordBritish.gif<br />
The Lord British from Life Force, another one of my favorite oldschool games.  I guess I have a thing for using sprites.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://pearll.homestead.com/files/Edanim.gif<br />
Smileys used by Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky the Fourth (sorry, I just love that name) from Cowboy Bebop[/img]<br />
<br />
<br />
http://pearll.homestead.com/files/PrinceJohn.jpg<br />
Prince John from Disney's Robin Hood.  A pox on the phoney king of England!</div></div><hr />

Argh, I wish they would make anime for that.  I was so disappointed with the ending.</div></div><hr />
