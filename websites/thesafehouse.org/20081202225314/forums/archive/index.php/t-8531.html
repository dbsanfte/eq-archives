You say, 'Hail, Renux Herkanor'<br />
<br />
Renux Herkanor says 'Master Hanns is going to kill me!  I let that dark assassin look at his prized poison collection and he lifted it all when I wasn't looking!  He even snatched his Grandmaster's Vial!  Master Hanns was so furious he grabbed one of his old blades from his collection and jabbed it at the wall so hard it shattered! I really need some help replacing all that was ruined or I have a feeling Master Hanns is going to send me on a suicide mission!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will help you replace all that was ruined'<br />
<br />
Renux Herkanor says 'Fantastic! I need to replace all those old poisons, the vial and that old scareling blade.  I think the bottles had the following written on them Bane, Burn, Essence, Sloth, Rage, Swiftness, Disorientation, and Dimethyl.  Please hurry!'<br />

<br />
250 poison means level 60.  At level 60, probably 99% of rogues have done or at least started on their epic.<br />
<br />
And to get epic, or get to general fight stage, we have to KILL Renux.  So how the hell can she be standing around in WK giving us a new poison related quest?<br />
<br />
Not that I think you're lying Vaslin, far from it.  This quest just makes no sense at all if you look at it contextually.</div></div><hr />

Went to WK to check this out.  Renux wasn't up.  So I waited.<br />
<br />
At 5pm Toxfodder despawned and respawned at 6pm (game time).  Renux did not spawn with him.</div></div><hr />

So is Eyerazia from Fear.  The grandmaster's vial isn't so easy.  Even at 250 you have a decent chance to fail the vial combine.  And it's expensive enough to hurt when it fails.

/sigh<br />
<br />
Let's hope for the sake of the &amp;lt; 55 crowd that if this does result in advanced poison combine that it doesn't triv at 250.  If that's the case, then the new poisons seem to be for the older crowd only.<br />

Here's hoping...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking of which, does anyone else find her &quot;scared apprentice&quot; speech a bit out of character?  Renux is a stone cold killer, the best the Circle has, not to mention Hanns's lover.  It seems odd she'd be so nervous over the loss of a handful of trinkets...</div></div><hr />

Once when I was just poking around and three other times for faction testing. One thing I have noticed though on Bertoxx at least, Tox despawned at 8AM, not PM, although I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it. You might stick around till 9AM and see if Renux pops then, if not another Tox despawn.</div></div><hr />

I doubt the new bag works in that handin quest (worth testing though).<br />
<br />
Interesting way of finding a use for the Grandmaster vial, by the way. I hope I am correct in assuming that this will only be needed for those that want to make 10- or 5-charges of the new poisons, and that you can make 1 charge without it. Otherwise I guess it is time to get to work on making myself a grandmaster vial soon  .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  I sure don't.<br />
<br />
I saw a thread on the Safehouse pub146.ezboard.com/fthesa...5766.topic<br />
and when I saw the broadcast that West Karanas, Plane of Innovation, and Plane of Justice was cominig down, I zoned into W. Karanas.  Once the zone came back up she was there and I hailed her.  Check the times of the posts.  Mine was way after Jasek Evil had already spotted her four hours earlier.  I was actually surprised to be first on this.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sorlun</div><div class="date">10-24-02, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night, after seeing this quest appear (page one) I raced down to WK and found Renux up (never thought to check the gametime).  I hailed her and got the &quot;not enough skill&quot; message. I had not made my GM trophy yet so off I went to make it.  After an hour of running around, I was successful on my GM trophy (yes! 1 try) and headed back down to WK.  I arrived at 5pm game time to find NO RENUX! I waited for her to spawn and she did at 9pm game time.  This time I hailed her from the front (conned Dub) and she said something like...<br />
<br />
&quot;I am surprised you lived after all that...&quot;  <br />
<br />
I used sneak and moved behind her and tried again. This time I got...<br />
<br />
&quot;you must prove yourself to the circle before we can...&quot;<br />
<br />
the &quot;I will help&quot; phrase listed on page one produced the same results. Off I went to PoK to do the faction quest.  I got my Travelers book and headed back to WK.  I killed the bandits while waiting for 9pm and Renux.  The bandits gave &quot;your Circle of hands faction has raised&quot; and I killed about 3 spawns at the camp east of the poison vendor and Renux.  <br />
<br />
At 9pm, Renux DID NOT spawn!!  I waited till 11pm and then camped for sleep.  <br />
<br />
Thats my report so far.<br />
<br />
PS  Lucky me I saved the Eyerazzia in the bank for sentimental reasons.  I was able to make most of the poisons on the list as well.  I was NOT able to make the one requiring &quot;No Hope Moss&quot; as I could not get any to drop.  Killed Frogloks in SoNH for an hour with no luck.  Any ideas?<br />

(I've had a &quot;no drop&quot; item replaced to me because it was accidently destroyed in a container)<br />

I myself think I've done the same and destroyed my Eyerazzia, but kept my BR.  (bah!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was really disappointed in this quest at first.  Its been confirmed in the lab that the result of this quest is used to combine our poisons.  For example, 5 poisons into a 5 charge poison.  SO why would rogues be required to be almost lvl 60 and spend countless K of plat in order to combine poisons when a shammy can do it with a 60 plat bag.<br />
<br />
Then I saw the text from Renux<br />
&quot;Here take this Seal, it was dropped by that dark stranger. It glows with a dark power I just don't understand. Be wary of further sightings of that dark assassin. &quot;<br />
<br />
Im really hoping we have other sightings of our dark friend and an alternative way to combine poisons (seal used for a different quest).  Otherwise our poison revamp will be junk IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sorlun</div><div class="date">10-25-02, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday I went back to WK to try and get this quest going again.  This time, I had my Planer book. I got to WK at around 8pm and waited.  At 11:00pm, still no Renux.   Server crashed A bit later.   After reset, I was in WK again.  This time Renux spawned.  She conned Dubious to me and when hailed, said &quot;I am surprised you are still alive after that&quot;.   So, off to Qeynos to do faction work with Circle of hands.<br />
<br />
At this time, a friend of mine (Bayler) was doing the faction quest.  He reached Warmly and went to WK and Renux would talk to him. After I got my faction up, I headed back to WK and waited for Renux to spawn.  9pm rolled around and no Renux. :-(   I camped for the night.  This morning, I logged on at 6pm game time.  Renux was not up.  I waited till 11pm without seeing her.  Thats where I am now on this quest.<br />
<br />
Supposition...<br />
<br />
(1a) Renux is a daily spawn who can skip spawns.<br />
or<br />
(1b) There is some PH that must remain alive or be killed to spawn her.<br />
<br />
(2) You need GM trophey and at Warmly faction<br />
<br />
I hailed Toxxfoder, said &quot;I need to see Renux&quot; and other stuff to no luck.<br />

Same str/dex/char/int and such as the GM vial.<br />
<br />
The only difference is what it summons. The Coffin Poison Bottle is a 10 slot container with a combine button. It is NOT no-rent, so you can summon one and keep stuff in it when you log. It does NOT have any weight reduction to it. Make sure you summon your no-rent bag and turn it in for the permanent 100% WR bag before you do this!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just need to get to warmly with the Circle again (all those darn Renux kills)  I'm only apprehensive, but the honeymead quest seems to be a bit fubar at the moment.  I seem to recall you could give him 4 stacks of 4.  Now you have to do 4 stacks of 1?  And the reply he spits out is some partly garbled mess.<br />
<br />
I left Shar Vahl at the tender age of level 1, and leveled up in and around Qeynos Hills, so I was easily able to get all my Qeynos factions up between gnolls, teeth, moonstones, rabid pelts, and honeymead.  Even tried QRG Animals a bit.  When I left around 12 or so, I was warmly, or ally to just about every faction in town, except the SK and Necro factions.  Most of my faction work revolved around the Moonstones, and the Honeymead to balance each other out.  That's why 4 stacks of 4 sticks in my mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wasn't the Dark Assassin also related to an SK quest?  He appeared in Everfrost and Feerott for sure.  But there was another spot as well.  Been awhile.</div></div><hr />

Go to Knargon *somethin like that* in the thieve's guild in Qeynos and say &quot;what shipment.&quot;  If you're dubious, sneak.  He'll give you a card to deliver to the de outside the gates over in the corner.  I believe the de spawns only at night but I'm not positive.  Since the card is not lore fill your packs up with them.  Then go to the de and turn them in, can turn them in 4 at a time, each gets you a faction hit.  He gives you a letter to give to Knargon for each one, take the letters back and turn them in and you'll get another faction hit.  Repeat until faction high enough then just use the &quot;Carson has a mole in Highpass&quot; until you get however high you want to get.  <br />

No fastest way is in quenos hills. Guards are on a 3.5 min repop. You can raise a faction level about every 5 to 6 guards killed. Friend of mine went from indiff to warmly in something like 6 kills and his quenos faction only dropped to amiable. Not that I can think of a good use for quenos faction.</div></div><hr />

Talk to the Zan guy; he stands next to the merchant in a room that gives the quest to visit Den. You have to say something to him and he will give you a note. This note you have to take to an informant in High Hold Pass in one of the bars. Now this normally would be crappy for faction because of the long except the fact that the note... isn't lore ;) If you grab about 4 packs full run to High Hold and hand them all in you will be warmly or allied w/ rogues and warmly/allied with most high hold factions. <br />
<br />
edit: the guys name is Prak in High Keep; the quest is the rogue errands quest<br />
<br />
edit2: &quot;Say to Zannsin Resdinet, 'hanns wants you to send some of your men to prak in highpass' &quot;<br />

you can skip all the other junk in this quest; btw you have to be low amiable to do this but still from amiable and up its the quickest way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I worked my way down into the guildhall in Qeynos with the intention of doing some newbie questing to get my faction up.<br />
<br />
No go. Knargon attacked me when I dropped hide to talk to him. I made a swift and roguely exit through the nearby sewer. Renux is still so upset about the dozen or so times I've killed her (It was nothing personal on my side.) that she camped the exit for quite a while in anticipation of my return. Thanks to my Tiny Cloak I was able to slip past her on my way back up to the surface.<br />
<br />
I then went in search of my fellow dwarf Tumpy. I purchased 200 Honey Meads in anticipation of meeting him. When I located him in one of the local establishments I then began to ply him with the alchaol like a prom date in hopes he would intercede on my behalf with the local underground. For the first 40 or so drinks he was cursing my name and I was getting no faction hits. After that point my plan seemed to be working because I began getting faction hits AND, get this, exp.<br />
<br />
You have to admire that Dwarf. After 200 bottles of mead he was not only still standing but he had never once excused himself to, as he puts it, drain the dragon.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after 200 bottles of mead I headed over to Crowe's to see if they'd let me in the door. I still conned threateningly so I went back to look up my good friend Tumpy.<br />
<br />
For some odd reason, he was no longer calling me Skippy, I no longer got faction hits with another full 200 bottles of Honey Mead and he was again cursing my name while threatening to give me the boot.<br />
<br />
What's up with Tumpy. Did I break him? I'd rather not have to sit at some bandit camp for untold hours waiting on respawn to get my faction up.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Misc. notes:<br />
I found doing the Knargon &quot;what shipment?&quot; quest was the fastest for getting me from dubious to amiable. Note that you will take negative hits to Merchants of Qeynos, Guards of Qeynos, and Ring of Scale while doing this. The first two were not very substantial, going from indifferent to apprehensive, and staying at amiable, respectively. I did not check the effect it had on Ring of Scale.<br />
<br />
Note you will need to sneak to get the shipment quest at dubious. Once at amaible, its 20 paces across the room to Hanns. Five minutes of &quot;Carson has a mole in Highpass&quot; to ally.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if anyone noticed or not, but the GMAS appears to now be summoning &quot;Coffin Potion Bottle&quot; - Im not sure if there was a change made to the name of this item, or it was simply refered to as &quot;Coffin Bottle&quot; for short previously.<br />

So what? You just want to go there to get a weapon that will most likely rot or be given to a pet.... why not ask the guilds that are going there if you can loot one? No @#%$ calendar can keep you from doing that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She told me to go away as my skills where not good enough. I thought it was because I hadn't done my epic or that I was level 52.<br />
<br />
Now that I know what she says obviously my lousy skill in poison making (approx 110) explains it all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_dealtdank</div><div class="date">11-03-02, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not that hard guys.  I actually enjoyed this quest, and had destroyed every piece it needed. Sure, I was kicking myself for destroying them when I heard, but I knew I did it before so it wasn't impossible.  It may be lame to use items in quests that so many probably destroyed or let rot a few times.  It would be much lamer if everyone was walking around with a GMAS a day after PoP's release, in my humble opinion.  I just feel sorry for those that had to do the burning rapier twice, as it is the main timesink involved other than getting poison to 250 and getting the grandmaster's vial.  On druzzil ro, not many people raid PoH or PoF anymore, so those were my biggest concerns.  I'm lucky to be blessed with friends who love challenges and we took 1 group to PoH for the SA, and 2 groups to PoF for the eyerazzia (tough break in there, but possible).  So far, I am impressed with the implemention of advanced poisons.  And I am damn proud of the safehouse community, cause we didn't get lucky like the other tradeskills (I know, you are saying its a class skill, thats another topic) and receive a book full of recipes the day we set foot on to the Plane of Knowledge, yet through the determination of many rogues, we pulled through and nailed most of it within a few days.  Don't fret guys and gals, it is worth it.  And on a side note, I received about 2.5 blue bubs in 60 for completing all of it.  I just hope there is more quests to be uncovered.  sorry for going on so long</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:47:41 2002] Renux Herkanor regards you as an ally -- she appears to be quite formidable.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:47:44 2002] You say, 'Hail, Renux Herkanor'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:47:44 2002] Renux Herkanor peers at you, looking you up and down 'Greetings Mizchif.  I wish you could help me, but you look like you lack the knowledge to perform the tasks I require.  Come back when you are ready.'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:47:52 2002] You say, 'what tasks?'<br />
***I decide to check how she likes me sneaked and behind her***<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:00 2002] You begin to sneak...<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:00 2002] You are as quiet as a cat stalking its prey.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:02 2002] Renux Herkanor regards you indifferently -- she appears to be quite formidable.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:04 2002] You say, 'Hail, Renux Herkanor'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:04 2002] Renux Herkanor peers at you, looking you up and down 'Greetings Mizchif.  I wish you could help me, but you look like you lack the knowledge to perform the tasks I require.  Come back when you are ready.'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:29 2002] You stop sneaking.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:47 2002] You say, 'I will help you replace all that was lost'<br />
^^^ This is the phrase from the earlier step to cause her to give you the combo-box<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:48:47 2002] Renux Herkanor says 'I told you Mizchif!  I wish you could help me, but you lack the skill to perform the tasks I require.  Come back when you are ready!'<br />
^^^ This is downright misleading! But, while not sneaking, I did the hand-in here (with fingers crossed)***<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Renux Herkanor says 'Great! Looks like everything is here!  Hopefully Master Hanns won't send me to Steamfont now, I have a really bad feeling about that assignment.  Here take this Seal, it was dropped by that dark stranger.  It glows with a dark power I just don't understand.  Be wary of further sightings of that dark assassin.'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Circle Of Unseen Hands got better.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Merchants of Qeynos got worse.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Corrupt Qeynos Guards got better.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos got worse.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] Your faction standing with Kane Bayle got better.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 22:49:04 2002] You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
I wonder if some of the people who report having lost their turn-in box (after combine) were sneaking and behind her, and hence were conning indif instead of ally to her? Edited by: Mizchif at: 11/6/02 9:51:17 am</div></div><hr />

Took me a few hours at most... auctioned to buy the Eyerazzia, and someone had one in market, got it for 400pp.  Ran all about collecting the poison ingredients... with PoP you can get about pretty quickly to collect them all.  Helped that I had a few in the bank but I basically did em all solo.  Got my vial, walked on over to Renux, and did the hand in, nothing to it.  It was worth it just for the nifty looking effect!<br />

Did all the poisons and the faction today, I had already made the vial earlier.  Took me about 6 hours total to gather the supplies for the poisons and the factioning.  By far the easiest way to faction is to kill the guards in Qeynos Hills.  I conned Renux earlier in the day and she was apprehensive to me.  After about an hour killing the guards I went back and was ALLY! Got the box, did the combine and got my very own seal =)<br />

As I entered Zone only Ginlin Toxfodder was up, and he even dont stand as he should be (outside house), after time passes by he did not respawn or did it very fast.<br />
<br />
I decided on next norrath day to kill him (green to 64) and he was very easy. I killed him at around 10 am and wonder 앒 wonder Renux spawned as next around 5 pm. <br />
<br />
So dont hesitate to kill ginlin if you have a date with renux.<br />
BTW he does not give a faction hit or a corpse as he is a merchant.</div></div><hr />

Since there was a recent change(bug?/nerf?) to the Zone Experience Modifier in city zones making xp in those cities much less, I would suggest going to a zone with a high modifier like PoP/Hole/Padudal/High Keep and do the combine there, and not combine it in a city zone.</div></div><hr />

I think its sad... oh well, the GMAS rules no less =)</div></div><hr />
