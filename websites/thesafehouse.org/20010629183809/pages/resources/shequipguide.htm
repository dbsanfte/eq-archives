                a guard. He is not always in the same place, but often can be

                guide is written to be as helpful as possible with ANY group makeup. 
                The group I go to Kedge with is made of of the following. Although 
                it's high, you do not need this type of firepower to control the 
                upper level (except for some exceptions, mentioned later). 50th

                Rogue (dats me!) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First 
                off, before you go to Kedge Keep, go to the Inn that is in East 
                Commons RIGHT NEXT TO the zone to West Commons and buy a TON of 
                Fish Scales for your druid/enchanter so that he can cast Enduring 
                Breath. Bards can also come in handy with their EB song. You could 
                also get a Rebreather or Aqualung from an Tinkerer and support 
                their trade. They can be expensive though. Magicians can also 
                summon Waterstones for underwater breathing and are great for 
                those times when your Enduring Breath (EB) is fading during combat 
                (which it shouldn't, more on that later) and you need to keep 
                alive till your EBer can recast it on you. You can also purchase 
                Potions of Water Breathing in Halas I believe. They go for 12pp. 
                Our group got 6 of them and have them hotkeyed just in case of 
                emergencies. On the subject of underwater combat. Few things you 
                should be aware of. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Melee 
                Classes</b> - When hit underwater by these fish, you get pushed 
                back. At first it's tough to fight underwater, but you'll get 
                used to it fast. Generally, you want to find something to prop 
                yourself against so you don't get pushed out of attack range if 
                the fish swings around and hits you back. It's not nessecery, 
                but it is helpful. Just past the Pull Zone (on the map below) 
                right before it opens up into the room is a ledge (you'll see 
                it when you get there and understand) that you can prop up against 
                when your puller drags it into the hallway there. You cannot swim 
                backwards normally. If you duck (D key) you can swim backwards 
                though! Also if you have SOW cast on you before you go in you 
                can swim backwards. You will also run low on stamina alot because 
                of swimming and fighting. Enchanters should have augmentation 
                on everyone to help with this, and other classes have stamina 
                regeration spells if need be. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Casters</b> 
                - Movement back / forth WILL interupt your casting, up down (without 
                forward or backward movement) will NOT interupt your casting. 
                Be aware that if a fish hits you, you WILL float backwards and 
                thus, interupt your casting. It is HIGHLY suggested that casters 
                stay in the corners, that way if they're hit, they don't float 
                back and at least have the chance to roll for a continued casting. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>On 
                Enduring Breath</b> - It is the ENTIRE group's responsibility 
                to be aware of the time remaining on EB. If someone dies due to 
                drowning, it's EVERYONE's fault for not keeping on top of it. 
                Enduring Breath is a 25 minute spell. Have someone in your group 
                with a stopwatch start timing when the first EB is cast and let 
                the group know when 20 minutes have elapsed. Recast when he says 
                the 20 mins are up. Don't wait the full 25 mins, no need to cut 
                it close. Everyone in the group should be aware of time remaining. 
                Don't get angry with folks asking &quot;time on EB&quot; ... they 
                just want to be informed. Casters under level 35 have the problem 
                of not even being able to tell when it runs out until they are 
                gulping for air, which is often times too late to save them.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>On 
                Rezzing in Kedge</b> - If you have a death in Kedge, and you have 
                a Cleric who can Rez, have your Druid or Enchanter ready to cast 
                Enduring Breath on the newly rezzed player. Also have the Cleric 
                ready on the heal. Rez sickness wipes any and all buffs from the 
                player, you'll have to be ready with the buffs. Okay, on to the

                  </b>- Can be nasty. They tended to be more RED then Yellow to 
                  me at 32. I'd say they average in the 34 to 37 levels. They 
                  are pretty much the same as Lancers 'cept they hit for more 
                  in the 70s and have a good amount more HPS. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Impalers 
                  </b>- 42 or so creatures. They are VERY nasty. They hit hard 
                  (101 was a common theme) and fast (double hit for 101 is fast 
                  enough for me). They also have a LOT of HPS. Do NOT let your 
                  casters get these aggro on them, you'll be minus a caster before 
                  you can do much. Seemed to spawn every half hour instead of 
                  one of the Lancer spawns on the far end of the room from the 
                  pull area. Those spawns are near the ceiling. </font></p>

                  Impaler </b>- Take an Impaler, give it more HPS and let it hit 
                  more in the 110-20 range. This creature drops the Gloomwater 
                  Harpoon that we all are after. It is a RARE spawn that takes 
                  the place of one of the Impaler spawns. Rare for even a rare 
                  spawn. I suggest that a mid 30 group be VERY careful with the 
                  Impaler and Fierce Impaler. You best have a VERY cohesive group. 
                  I'd venture to say that a upper 30s group could take the Impaler 
                  and Fierce Impaler spawns. The roaming path marked on the map 
                  is where the two flanking lancer spawns will roam. They just 
                  go back and forth. </font></p>

                Level Tactics </b>- Tactics used in this area were pretty basic. 
                Basically, be aware that you're prolly going to be pulling multiple 
                fishies. We had an Enchanter who could Mez or Charm the extras. 
                Druids can also Charm the fish. This can be vital during fights 
                down here as these fish are very nasty critters. I highly suggest 
                and Enchanter in the group. If not, have your Druid Charm an extra 
                fish if you get in trouble. Beware that when Charm breaks, the 
                Charmie is going to be VERY angry at your Druid, so beware. If 
                you have an Enchanter or Shamen, use a SLOWNESS spell. It's a 
                GREAT spell down there. Make sure to have your casters wait till 
                the meleers have taken the creature down a bit before nuking it. 
                Fish and casters do NOT go well together. </font></p>

                the upper room is cleared and you want to pull something, there 
                are some Fanged Tooth Piranna right when you go down on the second 
                floor. BEWARE of them. They were BLUE to the level 50 cleric in 
                our group. They hit hard (80s, double attack) and have A CRAPLOAD 
                of HPS. I'd venture to say they're considerably nastier than Seafury 
                Cyclopses. Our group (the one outlined at the begining of this 
                post) could manage 3 of them at a time, but this was ONLY because 
                of our Enchanter and Druids charming and Mezing, even then, we 
                found ourselves medding during the fight and, well, it was prolly 
                the nastiest fight I've witness in my time in EQ, and I've seen 
                some nasty ones. You WILL pull more than one from the below level.

                it sucks (only got cash of the Shark on the second level). All 
                in all, it's a GREAT time. I hope this guide has enlighted those

                For a good map and guide check out the Relentless Monks website 
                at monks.volitionx.com, the lower guk guide is specifically at 
                http://monks.volitionx.com/lowerguk.htm. I suggest you get these 
                maps, print them out and follow the guide through with them, marking 
                your path so you can easily find your way. The maps look pretty 
                good even when printed in Black and White (Greyscale). The spawn 
                you are looking for is 'a ghoul assassin' that spawns in the Supply 
                Room, also called the ass/supp spawn, on the maps the area is 
                marked as '19'. The mask you are looking for is his common drop, 
                the Serrated Bone Dirk (8dmg/27dly Pierce, Effect:Engulfing Darkness(Snare/DOT), 
                Rog Only) is his rare. He has place holders, so it can take a 
                while to spawn. Before going you should maybe put all your stuff 
                in the bank, if you die down here you may not get your body back. 
                At anywhere less then 25 be very careful as if you are trained 
                you have very little chance of making it out alive. If you have 
                any questions don't be afraid to ask. </font></p>

                should enter lower guk by the dead side entrance, this can be 
                found if you follow the right wall all the way from the innothule 
                zone to a lower guk zone. This is generally right as there are 
                a few spots you can skip and will want to. The only thing on the 
                way you should run into that can see through your hide/sneak is 
                the large and giant heart spiders. These are rare spawns and while 
                going thru the spider rooms (you will know them when you see them) 
                you can stick to the left wall to aviod them (even thou these 
                spawns are likely camped or dead) Normal heart spiders can be 
                snuck upon. After the spider room stick back to the right wall 
                you will enter the scryre room, just stay on the lower level and 
                take an exit behind the left water pillar, head down the ramp 
                here and you will enter a room with stone walls and pillars, head 
                to straight away from the ramp to the second section and along 
                it to the left (you can continue to follow the right wall but 
                you will hit a secret wall, just follow this secret wall as thou 
                it were solid) Continue allong the right wall, you will pass a 
                turn off to the left, keep going straight, you will slide down 
                a slippery section, and at the end it will open into high bluffs 
                over a watery area, carefully go over this area following the 
                right edge. Continue following the right wall until you turn into 
                a hall off from the main one you were just following, there should 
                be a stone just before the turn and a flaming pot in the hall, 
                this flaming pot is just opposite the dead side zone to lower 
                guk. </font></p>

                have to go out and get a SoW, or get an invis to undead before 
                proceeding. The reason is that you will run into some water and 
                unless you swim fast you won't make it under the water sneaking 
                (I am unsure what swimming skill you need to do it with sneak 
                on and without it on). Ok, now be careful, invis to undead(itu) 
                and sneak/hide do not stack and there are both undead and living

                be a slippery ramp and you will want to go back) You will turn

                the right, you will agian turn a gentle corner then a sharp corner 
                (this will be a 180 degree turn) before you come up, to the left 
                will be the area called the Bed Room(BR), if it isn't camped or 
                cleared there will be ghouls here, so don't jump out of the water

                Once you are hidden (or if you wanna try going with itu) go thru 
                the left hall, that is the one nearest the water. At the end of 
                this hall is the spider/bat room. The spiders and bats can't see 
                thru my invis but it is unknown to me if it is level based, if

                already someone in the group or one that got there before you 
                waiting then graciously allow them the first loot and they will 
                allow you a subsequent mask loot. At this point you have two options, 
                you can wait until you mask drops or you can ask a member of the

                long and someone else gets the mask. It can take several hours

                will have to reverse the aformentioned process and go back the

                take the water exit, but if your swimming is bad it will be a 
                long and hard swim, at least you will get practice. I am not going 
                to detail this way as it is longer and generally striaght forward.

                you won't need to sneak, just start running on in, the only thing 
                that would be trained that might attack you is the evil eye, anything 
                else would go to the dead side zone or the king's back door zone. 
                Now head straight down the ramp, straight down the hall, across 
                a bridge and follow the hall straight (stick to the right side, 
                you will hit a false wall but it has a solid wall right behind 
                it). Now you will pass one turnoff to the left, then will make 
                a sharp left turn into room with three exits, This is where the 
                minotuar patriarch spawns, he casts see invis and wanders. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Getting 
                to the Elder Spawn -</b> Continue to follow the right wall out 
                the right exit of the three way exit room. You very shortly come 
                to another intersenction, one path goes left, one right and another 
                does a U-turn back on the other side of a wall. Take the left. 
                Once you have taken the left follow the right wall again past 
                two left turns and follow it through another for exit room, you 
                will take a dip under upper cave that you can see a bit of through 
                a crack and after that take your first left. Once you take the 
                left take a right and follow the hall past a right turn and into 
                a room, this room has a pit over on the other side of it where 
                the minotuar elder spawns, it also cast's see invis. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Getting 
                to the Bridge - </b>Follow the right wall though this room and 
                stop before going down the hall, now read this first until i tell 
                you to continue. There is a pit trap down this hall, if you are 
                to young to have safe fall it might do you some nasty damage as 
                well as annoy you. If you are KoS and haven't yet been seen and 
                you fall down this you might die here, you won't be able to make 
                it up the ladder with sneak on, it has to be removed. Now to see 
                this pit trap look for a red mark on the left wall, this mark 
                indicates where the hole is, take a run at it and jump, you should 
                make it easily, if not climb up the pit into the room behind you 
                and try, try again. Ok continue down the hall, through a small 
                room and to the left up some ramps to a ladder, climb the ladder 
                into a small round room. Now just outside this room is where it 
                gets deadly, there are gargoyles out there and they won't like 
                you regardless of faction, race, or religion. They are living 
                and see invis to undead and they also see hide/sneak, I think 
                thou that regular invis will get you by them. Otherwise you will 
                have to call on someone to pull the gargoyles (many like to since 
                they aren't to tough and drop eyes that sell for 9pp). </font></p>

                Bridge and Dead Tower -</b> Once they are pulled put on sneak/hide 
                and head out, go to the right and you will come to the bridge/undead 
                tower, From here on out you can follow the dead side directions 
                from the same number, just be aware you are entering the tower 
                from a different way and will have to turn to your right on the 
                bridge. It should be easy to understand when you get there. </font></p>

              sit next to him when he spawns, you can see the message &quot;A
