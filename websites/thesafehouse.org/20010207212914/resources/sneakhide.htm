        Edited by Zato</i> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF" size="5">Introduction</font></b> <font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        In the year since EQ has been out, sneak/hide has gone though a number 
        of changes. What I want to do is give as much info as I can about it's 
        current status. I see many threads go back and forth about what sees though 
        it, what doesn't, different situations, etc., and I think it's time that 
        a comprehensive revision is done to show what it's currently capable of. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font size="5" color="#0000FF">What these skills 
        can do</font></b> <br>
        Sneak and hide are 2 seperate skills, each with their own hotkey. You 
        can use one or the other, or (most importantly) BOTH. These skills enable 
        you to move about virtually undetected from both living and undead creatures. 
        Sneak - When using just sneak, you lower the range a mob will become aggressive 
        to you. So long as you are behind the creature, you will not be detected. 
        While sneaking, you move at a snails pace, so you won't want to use it 
        unless you really need to. Sneak DOES NOT make you invis - you are perfectly 
        visible to everyone (PCs and NPCs) but mobs you are behind will not detect 
        you. Hide - Using hide makes you invisible. You will stay hidden until 
        you move from your current location. You CAN still pivot (ie: turn in 
        a circle without moving your location) and remain hidden. When you have 
        a NPC targeted (like in combat), turning off autoattack and activating 
        hide will trigger the EVADE skill to lower you on the monster's hate list. 
        Sneak/Hide - The best of both worlds. You will remain hidden while moving 
        (at a snails pace). The effects of sneak are still in place and you are 
        invisible to most creatures. </font></p>

        Merchants</font></b> <br>
        If you're having trouble dealing with a certain merchant because of your 
        chosen, um, professions... just go BEHIND and get into Sneak mode and 
        try again. /Con the merchant and when he or she views you indifferently 
        you may buy and sell to your little heart's content. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Factors to Consider 
        when using Sneak/Hide</font></b></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        </font><font color="#FFFFFF">There are several factors that are taken 
        into consideration when deciding whether sneak/hide is going to work. 
        Skill, Level (monster Con), Position, Speed, Area of Effect spells in 
        vicinity, and known mobs which will see you no matter what. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#0000FF">Facts</font></b> <br>
        Position - ANY MOB that you are sneaking behind, ANY mob, as long as it's 
        not facing you, if you are sneaking, will not be aggro. I've snuck up 
        behind Fire Giants, then poked my head around to the front of them, and 
        BAM, toast! *shrug* (Fire Giants are one of the mobs that see though sneak/hide 
        no matter what level/skill you are). MOBs who JUST see through hide - 
        Dragons for example, aren't fooled. See list below for more creatures 
        to watch out for. They will see though sneak/hide all the time. Now, before 
        you reply to this part 'but I snuck past a Lich! Lich's can't see me!' 
        remember to keep all other factors that I just went though above in mind. 
        Was the Lich green, were you moving FAST, did you stay behind it, etc.? 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#0000FF">Theories (unproven)</font></b> 
        <br>
        Skill - you are going to have a harder time sneaking a lvl 20 rogue to 
        the assassin in lower guk to pick up a free mask. Your skill is just not 
        sufficient enough, and things 'might' see though it. People have done 
        it successfully, but I'm just warning you, that it's not going to be easy. 
        Level (mob con) - ties in closely with skill, but if you are low level, 
        and mobs are deep red to you, chances are a lot higher that they will 
        see though it. For example, a level 50 rogue is going to have a much better 
        chance of making it past the bugs in Sol B, then a level 40 Rogue, even 
        if they both have sneak and hide maxed out. (they max at 200, at 40th 
        level) Speed - Speed is tied in closely with position. Some mobs will 
        see though sneak/hide, but NOT immediately. Here's my theory: Mobs have 
        an 'aggro meter'. This meter is triggered by such things as distance away 
        from mob, position in relation to mob (when using sneak), and TIME. I've 
        tested this against sonic bats in Sol B, and it's kind of like this: Sneak/hide 
        past a bat while SoW'd, you go by pretty quick, and 'most times' if other 
        conditions are also working for you, you'll make it by them w/o getting 
        aggro'd. If you aren't SoW'd, you are going slower, and this 'time' aggro 
        meter gets 'set off'. Actually, many mobs can be RAN right past! I've 
        seen time and time again, level 50's in Sol B that can run all the way 
        past sonic bats, Lava Duct Crawler's, and Death Beetle's without getting 
        aggro'd if they are SoW'd and just ZOOM on by them. This is not something 
        that you want to try to rely on, but can be very helpful. Also, when sneak/hiding 
        past bats, sometimes if you STOP behind a sonic bat, or a bug, then a 
        lot of times they will aggro immediately. Now, on top of all of these 
        main topics, a couple other things need to be mentioned. Sneak/hide does 
        RARELY just STOP. I had it just STOP on me just the other night in the 
        Plane of Hate. I was nowhere near any other mobs, any other characters, 
        nothing. Just sitting there, and all of a sudden 'you are no longer hidden'. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Other Notes</font></b> 
        <br>
        While using /con on monsters it may still say they are &quot;Ready to 
        Attack&quot; even though they really won't. Some monsters will always 
        say they are ready to attack when you con them, so you have to know whether 
        they see-invis or not to determine if they will really attack (see list 
        at the bottom of this guide). Having JBoots or SoW on you will GREATLY 
        enhance the usability of sneak/hide, becuase they help lessen the &quot;snails 
        pace&quot; that you normally sneak at. While sneaking it is very hard 
        to get off ladders and pull yourself up out of water. Keep this in mind..you 
        may have to un-sneak to get past that point and quickly re-hide and sneak 
        once clear of it. If you are a smaller race (Gnome/Dwarf), then using 
        your guise of deciever to become a Dark Elf will sometimes help with this 
        problem. Obviously, you need to have the foresight to use it before sneak/hiding 
        however. When sneaking while swimming in underwater areas, be very careful 
        because without SoW you might not make it to you destination before running 
        out of air. Unlike the Invis spell, Sneak/hide will not remain active 
        thru zone boundaries or when logging in/out. One more thing to always 
        keep in mind is how SNEAK lowers aggro. If you are unsure whether something 
        is going to see you, just ALWAYS keep as much distance as you can from 
        it. A greatly reduced aggro range is VERY nice! Keep that in mind. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Makkil of The Rathe sent in this little bit of 
        info. Definitely something to check into! Say you are about to collect 
        your belongings from your corpse in hostile territory... What I do is: 
        - Hit my Hide hotkey to Unhide myself - I type /loot with my corpse targeted 
        - Hit the enter key to execute the /loot command - Quickly hit the Hide 
        hotkey again. I do get the &quot;you have hidden succesfully&quot; message, 
        and the loot screen is up. I collect my stuff and move on for revenge. 
        I have not been able to confirm this, since I keep forgetting to ask whether 
        anybody can see me as I loot. </font></p>
