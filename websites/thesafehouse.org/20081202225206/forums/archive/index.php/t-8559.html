<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arctura Silvermist</div><div class="date">05-29-03, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a ton of questions.. anyone able to help?<br />
<br />
I was curious if anyone could elaborate on the story behind Befallen! <br />
I am pretty sure its one of the palaces from Takish Hiz, the ancient elven city which resided in the Elladar Forest, on Tunaria (Antonica now).The zone originally had two entrances, several more elaborate halls and rooms, and perhaps even two entrances, before the decaying ruin that happened to it over the ages. (the second entrance is likely under the sands in WC, if you look at the zone's map, it looks very similar to another two-zoneline zone, such as Highkeep, yet it's blocked off.<br />
--There appears to be a legion of undead who have taken up residence in Befallen and are excavating it, making new tunnels, and breaking into previously unaccessible rooms (so im thinking, similar to grave-robbers of ancient egypt). (skeleton foreman, excavator, etc.)<br />
<br />
The thex's.<br />
Queen Cristanos Thex. Queen of the dark elves. Powerful caster.<br />
King Naythox Thex. King of Dark elves, a warrior.<br />
King Tearis Thex. King of the High elves? not much i have found on him.<br />
Princess Lenya Thex. Center of a kidnapping conspiracy one day as she travelled to qeynos and never was seen again. (she's a fish in Lake Rathe)<br />
How are they all related? Whats their story?<br />
<br />
The Burning Dead. This is a faction that you can lose by killing necro acolytes, theurgists, neophytes, apprentices, and Shadowknights in Befallen. The Burning dead is similar to the Dead (Dark elf SK's and Necros). <br />
The WAND OF THE BURNING DEAD. This quest is apparently broken, if it ever was working in the first place, despite the sketchy quest details on Allakhazam's.<br />
I have the blackened sapphire (sapphire of souls), and the blackened wand (marnek's wand), and give both to Opal Darkbriar (dark elf version), and she says she doesnt need them. Apparently there is a third part to the wand i need, but she wont accept the other two. Im hoping the third part is a container you combine the other two in, similar to the thex mallet.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the Burning Dead were a select faction of The Dead (DE SK's n Necros) that ventured to Befallen and are trying to raies the necromancer Marnek?<br />
The raising of Marnek part is true, and can be learned by asking Sir Arium Arcanum, or Kidzean Gix various things.<br />
<br />
Marnek! He is/was a legendary necro, so they say. Only his dagger and wand (Blackened wand) can be found in game, off Priest Amiaz, and the Thaumaturgist, deep under Befallen.  Anyone know any more? Bane? any leads?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kelisk</div><div class="date">05-30-03, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Thex bloodline is that of the original High Elven royals.  One King and Queen couple was kidnapped long ago by Innoruuk and twisted into the first Dark Elves, but kept the name.  Cristianos and Naythex are not that original couple, but they are the newest incarnation of the Dark Elven part of the Thex bloodline.  The High Elven Thex family's queen was killed giving birth to Firiona Vie, whose father is Tearis Thex.</div></div><hr />

Not strickly true - both the King and the Queen are imposters/usurpers, using the name 'Thex' to help rally support and inspire loyalty.<br />
<br />
Insomuch as teir'dal can be loyal, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lonzrick</div><div class="date">06-03-03, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have EQOA, but supposedly it takes place about 500 years *before* EQ1.<br />
<br />
If I recall the minutea right, in EQOA Befallen is something called the Outpost of Marr which is a city or temple or somesuch devoted to Mithaniel Marr....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_fronithunderpaws</div><div class="date">06-03-03, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a EQRPG expansion for Befallen that explains some of it - this are fun to read just for the background that gets filled in.  I am at work so this is from memory and lacking some details - Befallen was established as a base for the Knights of Marr, but came with a corrupting malevolence.  That force would empower the folks in charge of Befallen while at the same time cursing them to stay there - happened to all of the named folks in the zone.  I forgot if there were details on where the force came from.<br />
<br />
The burning dead are the result of gnomish necromancy and kind of tie into the story of the Dark Reflection (I think).  Yes Inny has an influence there and not Berty, but I am pretty sure Marnek is a gnome.<br />
<br />
Stop by a bookstore and read the EQRPG expansion - it is kind of neat.  There is another one out for Freeport that has a bit of explanation on Opal Darkbriar's multiple personalities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arctura Silvermist</div><div class="date">06-03-03, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Befallen isnt one of the last remnants of Takish Hiz? I really thought it was... hence the identical decor in Felwithe as in Befallen, the elf skeleton, the Thex Mallet quest being there, etc etc.. so whats the real backstory? The new EQOA one (SOE's), or Brad McQuaid and company's version? (whitewolf (or sigil?) i forget which).<br />
<br />
I so want those expansions.. too bad they dont come out in Canada &gt;=(. Ebay or something i must get. or just order em online, damn shipping costs.<br />
<br />
Freeport, Monsters of Norrath, and Befallen i am looking forward to!  I wonder whats next? I hope they will give us some back story on Takish Hiz, a little more lore would be nice =)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_fronithunderpaws</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK writing this from work so I might not get this quite right but I reread it last night and have more details. (WTB improved memory)<br />
<br />
Befallen started as a Chapterhouse of the Fists of Marr and was used to store all sorts of ancient artifacts that the Knights of Marr would find including the Thex Mallet which I guess they found in the Desert of Ro which is what is left of Takish Hiz (and the city itself remains buried.)<br />
<br />
After the incident in Blackburrow, Gynok Moltor sought refuge in whatever Befallen was originally called until he had his strength back and then proceeded to kill his benefactors and sacrificed them to an unknown diety to provide him with power - that awoke/created the malovolence that then enslaved him to Befallen.  Through the years other folks came to seek the ancient artifacts stored there and fell prey to the curse.  Bunches of dark elves came for the Thex Mallet, the troll shadowknight came as did other adventurers and folks who wanted to learn more necromantic secrets.  When a strong leader came, they got the power they wanted (mainly control over the undead of Befallen, but they could never leave).  <br />
<br />
A necromancer of the burning dead (they are gnomish necromancers that follow Solusek Ro) came to revive their ancient leader Marnek Jaull (he attempted the lich thing like Miragul and Venril).  <br />
<br />
Backstory is from Whitewolf pen and paper version, but I hope that they are working with the SOE team - especially since there is usually a quest tie in to regular EQ. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh next pen and paper expansion is out this month sometime and details Everfrost including Miragul's dungeon/laboratory. Edited by: fronithunderpaws at: 6/4/03 5:30 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
You DO know what Tunarbos is, don't you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_fronithunderpaws</div><div class="date">06-06-03, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, you need to explain Tunarbos - sounds like the name of Tunare's tree (arbor = tree in um latin, yeah, that's it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arctura Silvermist</div><div class="date">06-11-03, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have entered Surefall Glade.<br />
<br />
You say, 'what was Tunarbos'<br />
<br />
Ran Walker says 'Long ago, centuries before the Combine Era even, there grew a great tree upon Norrath.  It stretched to the stars and was as wide as the span of Erud's Crossing.  From the roots of this tree sprung all the woodlands of Norrath.  An unknown force struck it down.  Some say it was the great dragon, Veeshan!!  Whatever the force, the Great Tunarbos was shattered.  Lost forever.  Now the wood chips lie scattered across the face of Norrath.  To hold a shard of the Great Tunarbos is to hold the hand of Tunare.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_EQFattius</div><div class="date">06-11-03, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i picked my nose with one of those shards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DreamspinnerSethan</div><div class="date">06-19-03, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in case you didn't notice, the architecture is not similar to Felwithe any more than Halls of Honor is similar to Freeport. The influences from certain Earth societies is there, but there's a difference.<br />
<br />
Notably, Felwithe's city is made to show off bits of the landscape: the bridge over the entrance allows one to see the river, and the back area near that river is a really well-done promenade. <br />
On the other hand, Befallen hides all sight of the natural world. There isn't a place in there where windows were, or which allowed one to look out into the wilderness. It also, I think it is obvious, is dated AFTER the mountains were formed . . . otherwise the place would be a lot worse off, not to mention higher in the mountains  <br />
<br />
Of Thex, the royal house recognized by today's elven nations . . . all three of them . . . was the one from which Innoruuk stole the king and queen. They ruled Neriak once upon a time, but they died off without leaving successors and we know how dark elves love that sort of thing . . .<br />
&quot;Queen&quot; Cristianos Thex has no connection to the family, and is no queen. She assumes the title and family name to try to give her some legitimacy. <br />
&quot;King&quot; Naythos Thex is likewise only pretending, but he's on a bit shakier ground since he supports the Spurned. After all, Necromancy is sacred to the Teir'dal . . .<br />
King Tearis Thex is the current king of Felwithe, and he has two daughters: Firiona Vie and Lenya Thex. Lenya went missing a while ago . . . Firiona dropped the family name as part of her assuming the position of Champion of Tunare. Far as I can tell that's what happened  <br />
There is also an ice giant named 'Thex'ka' . . . but don't know what's with that. Probably translates to 'elf killer' or some such . . .<br />
<br />
As for Marnek, well, there is not a whole lot of information on him in game I think. Of course, any Gnome Necromancers want to fill in what I am missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arctura Silvermist</div><div class="date">06-19-03, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here you go. <br />
Quest dialogue for the monk red sash in freeport at the Ashen Order.<br />
<br />
'Hail, Reyia Beslin' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'Greetings, Bodi . I am Reyia Beslin of the Ashen Order. I help to train our members and I am in charge of handing out the orange and red Sashes of Order. Would you like to know [how you can get an orange sash]? Or maybe you think you are ready to earn the [red sash]? <br />
<br />
'I am ready for the red sash' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'So, you think you are skilled enough to earn the red Sash of Order, Bodi ? I have just the [task] for you then. But be warned, this will be the toughest challenge you have faced yet. There are many legends and myths of great heroes and ancient evils from all over Norrath. Here in Freeport, we get travelers from all over the world, and we get their tales as well. The point is that most of these stories are just that, stories and fairy tales. Told to amuse people and frighten children. I also thought the tales I'd heard about the [Marnek Jaull] were only legends, but now I know better. <br />
<br />
'Who is Marnek Jaull?' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'Marnek Jaull led a cult of necromancers who followed the Burning Prince, Solusek Ro. He built an army, known as the Burning Dead, and spread destruction and fire throughout Antonica. Over the years, the Burning Dead fought many fierce and bloody battles with the paladins of Prexus, the Oceanlord. Though Marnek achieved many victories over the paladins, ultimately they were able to defeat him and destroy the Burning Dead. Legends say that before his defeat, Marnek created many powerful weapons and items, and wrote many books on his findings in the areas of magic. Many of these items were hidden away from the paladin forces, and remain untouched, waiting for Marnek's return, as the legends go. <br />
<br />
'What task?' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'I've heard a few legends of a powerful wand that Marnek himself used to wield. This was known as the wand of the Burning Dead, and was rumored to instill its owner with mystical energies. The legends I have heard all differed on the wand's creation and powers, but the basic story was always the same. I will [tell you the legend] if you like. The task I have for you is to bring me the two parts that make up the wand of the Burning Dead, before they can be assembled and used for evil once again. Bring me [Marnek's wand] and the [Sapphire of Souls], along with your orange sash, and you will have proven yourself a loyal member of the Ashen Order, worthy of receiving the red sash. <br />
<br />
'I would like you to tell me the legend' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'The legend of the wand of the Burning Dead goes basically like this, though you may hear slighty different versions from others. Marnek did a lot of experiments and created an unknown number of diabolical artifacts and weapons. One of his creations was this wand. Marnek fashioned a charred wand from the scorched bone of a paladin of Prexus, and Solusek Ro himself created the wretched Sapphire of Souls. Then, Marnek and his priests combined these, with the Burning Prince's blessing, to create the wand of the Burning Dead. Marnek used this Wand and its powers in his evil and destructive reign over Antonica. Years later, as Marnek starting losing battles to the paladins of Prexus, one of his own followers, a necromancer named Kenox, was able to steal the wand. Sensing Marnek's defeat, Kenox made his way toward Odus, hoping to strike a deal with the paladins for the wand. Would you like me to [tell you about Kenox]? <br />
<br />
'I would like you to tell me about Kenox' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'Well, Kenox was not as sly as he liked to think he was. Marnek knew full well what he was up to, but let him continue with his plans. Kenox had arranged to meet with two paladins late one nght on a small island in Erud's Crossing, a place that would be considered neutral ground. Sir Toran Neshal, leader of the paladins, knowing the power of the wand, was certainly not going to make any deals with a servant of Solusek Ro, and definitely not foolish enough to take any chances with this mission. Imagine the look on Kenox's face when a ship carrying more than 25 paladins, including Sir Toran, arrived at the small island! The paladins immediately captured Kenox and the wand, and headed back to Erudin. Would like me to [tell you what happened to Toran]? <br />
<br />
'What happened to Toran?' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'Below the deck of the ship, Toran and his men questioned Kenox and carefully inspected the wand. Toran ordered one of his men to pick up the wand and try to identify its true powers. The man picked up the wand, but was unable to decipher its magic. He handed it to Toran, just as Marnek and Solusek had hoped, and the wand exploded, instantly incinerating the ship and everyone aboard, and lighting up the night sky with a giant fireball. Marnek's plan had succeeded. With the help and blessing of the Burning Prince, they had destroyed Sir Toran and an entire squad of Prexus' finest paladins. Years later, though, the paladins were able to regroup and ultimately defeat Marnek. The wand of the Burning Dead was destroyed and gone forever. Or least, that's what we thought. This wand must never be allowed to be made whole again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HooVooLoo</div><div class="date">06-22-03, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you have mentioned the EQRPG books, I thought I'd post a summary of what I had found in-game based on the Monsters of Norrath fiction.  I don't have the book, but rather gleaned the hints from other EQ players and the eqrpg.com website.<br />
<br />
I was always fascinated at how they actually coded this stuff into the game, and hoped that one day they would continue this storyline because it is very interesting.  Do they intend to try to bring Marnek the Wicked into the game with the next expansion?  I hope so, as I think it would be an exciting side-story to the overall fiction of the game.  Part of me, however, thinks that it will lead nowhere and it was simply put in so people with the RPG books could kind of &quot;play the story&quot; in-game while pen-and-papering.  A rich history there is though.<br />
<br />
The Ressurection of Marnek the Wicked<br />
<br />
Part One - Befallen <br />
Sir Ariam Arcanum says 'My thanks for destroying these minions of Befallen's masters' Sir Ariam's form suddenly contorts in agony. 'This accursed place rends my soul trying to twist me to its purposes. My time here is short.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'I sense a deep pain within you, ghost. Is there some way I might assist you so that you may find eternal rest?' <br />
Sir Ariam Arcanum says 'Our time is short, hero, for the minions of the Burning Dead will soon sense something is amiss here. Will you perform a task so we might destroy the evil that dwells within Befallen?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will perform any task that will cleanse this place' <br />
Sir Ariam Arcanum says 'I have this parchment that must be delivered to either the Knights of Truth in freeport or to the Queen of Neriak. The contents of the note concern them both and I am desperate to have this matter addressed so ask that you take it to which ever of the cities will accept your presence. Will you take the note to the [Knights of Truth] or to [The Dead]?' <br />
<br />
(It's cool to note that the evil and the good are united in a single cause…) <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will take them to the Knights of Truth' <br />
Sir Ariam Arcanum says 'It must be delivered to Sir Artanis in the city of Freeport. It details a terrible plan of the masters of this place to restore life to a foul necromancer named Marnek. The Burning Dead must not be allowed to achieve this goal. So that you may ride swiftly with news of this nefarious scheme, take this as well, the bridle to the noble steed that was entombed alive with me here. He has strength enough for one final ride.' <br />
<br />
Or… <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will take them to the Dead' <br />
Sir Ariam Arcanum says 'It must be delivered to Xon Quetill in the city of Neriak. It details a terrible plan of the masters of this place to restore life… <br />
<br />
You receive a Ghostly Bridle, which is a no-rent no-drop expendable bridle with a Summon Horse charge. <br />
You also receive the parchment, which reads… <br />
<br />
 ...all our enemies will once again tremble. My friends, the pieces are nearly in place so that our great master, Marnek Jaull may rise up again and spread the cleansing fire of the Burning Prince. Oh, how little our enemies realize! There are some among them who believe they have the knowledge to properly assemble the masters wand. And they deem mere legend the threat of so many of the masters other great weapons and his repository of knowledge that we have carefully safeguarded until this time: his return. The time is near. Rejoice. <br />
<br />
In humble service to Solusek Ro, Priest Amiaz.&quot; <br />
<br />
Handing in the note to Sir Artanis… <br />
<br />
Sir Artanis says 'By Marr, what is this? .. Burning Dead .. .. Marnek! By my blade this must be stopped! Where did you find this?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'In Befallen' <br />
Sir Artanis says 'You did well to ride swiftly with this news. I must take this directly to Valeron Dushire. If you learn more about this plot that would unleash this monster upon Norrath or wish to someday soon aid the Knights of Truth in putting down this evil, then return to speak to me again at a later time.' <br />
<br />
Handing in the note to Xon Quetill… <br />
Xon Quexill says 'Very interesting, servant of the Queen. This deed has stayed my wrath for this interruption of my business. Where did you find this? <br />
<br />
You say, 'In Befallen' <br />
Xon Quexill says 'It is true that the return of Marnek could create difficulties for us, especially if this has the blessing of Solusek Ro himself. Therefore, I command you to deliver to me any further information you uncover regarding the plans of the Burning Dead, and likewise I order you to return here at my bidding for further instructions in this matter. Now, begone.' <br />
<br />
And that's where part one ends. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
Part Two - Mistmoore Castle <br />
<br />
Ssynthi interaction… <br />
<br />
You say, 'A new breed of shadowed man walks Norrath. What can you tell me of the deathspeakers?' <br />
Ssynthi says 'Ah, so the deathspeakers have decided to reveal themselves again. They are beings who claim they are closer to the realms of the dead than any other known race, and they have been known to rally the shadowed men in times when they deem other races to be dabbling too much in the powers of death and rebirth. Just as shadowed men as a whole despise those of us who follow Solusek Ro because they deem all of magic to have sprung from themselves.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Could it concern the Burning Dead's plan to resurrect Marnek?' <br />
Ssynthi says 'Marnek, you say?! I admit that rumors have come to me concerning an alliance between the Temple of Ro and the Burning Dead, and perhaps this is the goal of that union. I must therefore act, for who knows the shadowed men better than I? But I cannot leave this place right now. Will you help me in this task?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will help you' <br />
Ssynthi says 'Then take this and collect within the drops of shadow that spill when a deathspeaker is killed. There will be a deathspeaker wherever shadowed men can be found, but even more important is the location of Ytyrs the Reborn. His shadow must be collected as well. And have care not to mix this shadow stuff with drink lest you unleash a dangerous magic.' <br />
<br />
Ssynthi gives you an 8-slot Cauldron of Shadow Essense, and then it's off to find the Shadowed Men! <br />
<br />
I suppose in hindsight one could say EQ planned to have only 7 Shadowed Man camps scattered about the old world because of a long-term plan to add this stuff much later on in the game's lifecycle…NAH! Hehe. <br />
<br />
So you go to each Shadowed Man camp at Nektulous, Innothule, West Commons, Kithicor, Lavastorm, Lesser Fay and South Karana. A rare drop from each camp is a Vial of Shadow, no-drop and lore. Each Vial identifies differently… <br />
<br />
Innothule - Shadow of the first Deathspeaker <br />
Nektulous - Shadow of the second Deathspeaker <br />
Lavastorm - Shadow of the third Deathspeaker <br />
Lesser Fay - Shadow of the fourth Deathspeaker <br />
South K. - Shadow of the fifth Deathspeaker <br />
West C. - Shadow of the sixth Deathspeaker <br />
Kithicor - Shadow of the seventh Deathspeaker <br />
<br />
Then you find Ytyrs in Rathe Mountains, at the undead circle. He drops Vial of Ytyrs the Reborn. <br />
<br />
Toss them all into the Cauldron, combine, and you get a Concoction of Shadow, which identifies as the &quot;Shadow of the eight Deathspeakers&quot;, or &quot;essence of&quot;, I forget. Handing it into Ssynthi gets you a... <br />
<br />
Penumbral Rod - Magic Lore No drop <br />
Primary Secondary <br />
Wis +5 Int +5 Mana +25 Sv Magic +3 <br />
Effect: Shadow Burst 3 charges (cast time: 10.0) <br />
Class: Clr Pal Rng Shd Dru Brd Shm Nec Wiz Mag Enc Bst <br />
Race: all <br />
<br />
Shadow Burst is… <br />
Regeneration for 250 Mana in 5 ticks <br />
DoT for 125 Hit Points (HP) in 5 ticks <br />
Ultravision <br />
<br />
And that's where part two ends.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
That's all I ever found, and since the rewards were so minimal and made no sense for the time involved, I figured  it's not going to lead anywhere.  I hope I am proven wrong though!<br />
<br />
It is interesting to note that they took out the Burning Dead wand and Marnek's lore so long ago, and have now reintroduced it since PoP's release.  One must wonder, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
*Note: I don't know if the Innothule Shadowmen are still in the game since the overthrow of Grobb, because where they used to be there are now some Gukta NPCs.  If they were removed, then this truly is a dead end since it could no longer be completed.<br />
<br />
Also, I never did figure out what could be mixed with what to &quot;unleash a dangerous magic&quot;.*<br />

<br />
On the back page where they give the ongoing story, there's a sidebar (Not on the side tho, underneath it, heh) where they talk about how the Game Master's Guide quest is being put into the game, how it's taking a while because it's &quot;HUGE&quot;, yada yada. <br />
<br />
But in the middle of it they say how the &quot;Greater Robe of the Oracle&quot; quest has been in the game for sometime now.  They also say it's &quot;uber&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can somebody with the book please post exactly what they say in those 2-3 sentences about this quest already being in the game, so we have more peeps dissect it here online?<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />
