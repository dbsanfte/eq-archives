<br />
You make a trophy item that isn't trivial at 250...though if you have 250 skill, the 5% on the trophy doesn't help...<br />
<br />
On another note, there is another + poison making item that drops at the poacher camp in jaggedpine.  It is only 3%, but pretty much anyone could get it (don't have to have 250 skill to make an item to give you +poison making)<br />

Yes, It does. Purhaps you need to look into what modifiers do..</div></div><hr />

Modifiers can not raise your skill beyond the max in other words if you allready need about maxed skill to aquire an item with a mod for that skill then effectively you gain...nothing from it.</div></div><hr />

In any case, at 250 you will still get a bonus from a modifier. Ishwar - level 55 Barbarian Rogue - Wind of Tranquility - AB server</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please tell me how to &quot;look into how skill mods work&quot;.  Please do tell.<br />
<br />
Maybe there is something out there that is trivial at 254 instead of 250 and by equiping the seal you get the &quot;you're beyond the skill&quot; message when creating.  Perhaps this is how you know.  Otherwise, the only thing I have to go on is that if I am max skilled, equip the item and get no increase, then I can only assume that it gives me no bonus. <br />

<br />
They've also assured us that you can't bring your skill past the hard-coded 252 cap for ANY skill with ANY mods whatsoever.<br />
<br />
So, as it stands now, yes, 5% mod does help a very little, but the amount it will help is less than 1%.<br />
<br />
The only way this is different is if they changed some of the core code with PoP, and since no other skills go up, I highly doubt that they changed it at all. Sig nerfed per rules. Signiture once per thread. Please read the FORUM RULES. Thankyou. --Gyorg<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dave Th</div><div class="date">10-31-02, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have to ask: <br />
<br />
Im L61 with a GM Vial and posion mastery 1 and 250 skill. I was thinking about getting another vial once I get the seal (I need the chrisma). Will the +Posion stack or will it use the highest. I have Planer Power 1 so my normal skills can go to 265 so would that be my posion max?</div></div><hr />

What would you ever need +100 CHA for?  taking my CHA from 105 to 205 made zero change in prices from merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ishwar2</div><div class="date">11-01-02, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FAQ on modifiers and tradeskills found here<br />

<br />
No it is not know if the cap is 252 and 255, conflicting statements have been made by VI people, and no one have really been able to verify this in game. At least I have looked closely for any hard evidence anywhere, but found none.<br />
<br />
Skill mods do not stack, only reason to get a vial after getting seal is for the stat mods.<br />
<br />
Also the skill is only modifed with respect to success rate, if you have 100 skill and a +10% item, you would still be able to raise skill on a 108 trivial item. The modified skill will not show in your skill list (though that would be a nice feature, if it showed in () ) Ishwar - level 55 Barbarian Rogue - Wind of Tranquility - AB server</div></div><hr />

Viscer you um ever...picklock Jaled Dar door? Or maybe any doors in Ssra? How did you do that? What you say? You used a pick lock modifier to go beyond that 210 cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">11-01-02, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skill mods do stack.  This is verifiable with lockpicking, and you'll find a thread with proof buried in the Training Studio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">11-03-02, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes they do stack. 2% is enough to open the door to jaled dar but only 2% wont open all ssra doors. to open some I have to equipt another 2 or 3 percent modifier item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_particleboy</div><div class="date">11-03-02, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hard cap for skills is 252.  An easy way to confirm this is with Rei´s Battleworn Dirk.  Equipping this with 250 piercing will give a gain in ATK consistent with an increase of 2 in piercing skill.  Its not an absolute confirmation but its a reasonable indicator.<br />

<br />
We have 252 piercing cap. If you equip at that skill level a +1 or more % piercing item, you will notice that you gain 5-7 attack, even with maxed strength before and after... This is because a higher skill level in your weapon skill equals to more ATK. Same deal with Make Poison. Soft cap is 250, hard cap is 255.</div></div><hr />
