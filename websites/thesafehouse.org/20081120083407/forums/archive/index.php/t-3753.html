Consider the fact that all they changed was to make the mobs non-stunnable with the new LDoN enchanter spell, which should be nothing more than setting one flag per mob that sawns during the encounter. And it broke the entire encounter. <br />

Just imagine what would happen if they really attempted to change something.</div></div><hr />

We have always done coirnav within 14Min( 11.30 the shortest) and always got ported at 15 or even 14 but thats because we average 55 for him not 80+ like some guilds which totally lagged the event and enabled you to get 20+ min to do it. Its doable fine and if it had been fixed earlier there would be way less guilds in time heh.<br />
<br />
                Edit: the fact that you get ported once coirnav is dead is a bug which need to be fixed. 15Min timer is correct tho, just stop the slack and you ll be able to do it fine. 80 + people will lag you more than it will help tho. Edited by: kinu at: 10/12/03 6:38 pm</div></div><hr />

It's always been exactly 15 minutes on Test.  Thats what the encounter is designed for.  I wish we got 18-24 minutes, we would've beaten it 5 months ago lol.  Don't call it a nerf, it's a fix. Refine your tactics and its trivial to do in 15 minutes if yer smart.  We're 3/3 on our last 3 tries and we're on the &quot;gimp&quot; (Test) server.  You dont need extra time, you dont need the lame LDoN stun, just think outside the box and its trivial to beat within the time limit~ Edited by: Dalien at: 10/12/03 6:39 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
nah.  This event is HARD.  MUCH harder than it was before the patch.  Its not the lame stun thing, and its not the time limit.<br />
<br />
Two other things changed as well:<br />
<br />
- The mobs are all untrackable<br />
- Ranged weapons no longer work in the fish pit<br />
<br />
That makes it a lot harder to pull the first 3 waves.  This event is never going to be trivial... not in the way the other 3 elemental lords are.</div></div><hr />

its like baking a cake. if you dont have a recipe and cant cook then it will be hard, but once you have done it a few times successfuly,then baking a cake will be easy. <br />

yeah coirnav seems extremly hard now, but each time you'll get better and better. you can do it *waves his little Ak'anon flags*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you wise ones tell me why range attacks should or need to be disabeled for the entire event?  Can you tell me why all the minis aren't trackable anymore?  Was it just too easy to find them underwater?<br />
<br />
If these 'fixes' are intentional, they're about the same as saying 'hey, Fennin is too easy, let's have him rooted to his chair, and call waves of elite guardians whenever he pleases'.  It's practically an entire revamp of the event - and one you can't repeat - you fail, and you blow it.</div></div><hr />

Look at the guilds site.. 5 sec left. <br />
We already beat it a few times before the &quot;nerf&quot; so I dont worry all to hard (considering we been close already the other day and will prolly be able to kill it again)<br />
The only point that is been missed, is that Corry needs to be designed for guilds not having any gear from PoTime.... consider this, then answer again if its &quot;balanced&quot;    Edited by: MerriRZ at: 10/13/03 10:20 am</div></div><hr />

          Make you wonder how guilds did when no one was in time and they completed event in 12min..... YES! thats it they had a gm 32king mobs for them ! Thats a good explanation... Whatever hehe we always did coirnav within 15Min, if we can I m sure others can too.<br />
<br />
                  Shrug anyway I don't think bitching because event got &quot;changed&quot; will do anything. Top guilds are quite used to that kind of changes by now. Edited by: kinu at: 10/13/03 12:05 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rasil Sabishi</div><div class="date">10-13-03, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinu, I assume you've done the new coirnav? And, based upon your statements, you believe that it is now back in line with how hard coirnav was back when you did the event under 15 min? Which would be, by my understanding, longer then 8 months ago (due to comments that the last version of coirnav was around for 8 months prior to this most recent change)?<br />
<br />
So let's see if I'm following your line of thought here. By reading what you said, I get that your guild killed Coirnav pre-time gear longer then 8 months ago, and that the event is now as hard as it was back when you did it with pre-time gear and everyone should stop bitching and butch up and beat the harder event, like you guys did over 8 months ago, with pre-time equipment on a sub 16 minute timer. (Yay run on sentences!)<br />
<br />
That about right or am I missing something?<br />

Redundancy is great.</div></div><hr />

Its a little early to pass judgement as to the question of overall difficulty of the event now as a certain amount of relearning needs to take place.<br />

I'm 99.9% sure that you dont need time gear to win either, as we came pretty close day after patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope that statement is clear and concise... yes I mean the current Live incarnation... no I dont mean a version from a month ago.<br />
<br />
Yes, its a dicey encounter that you will likely fail at quite a few times.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is harder on live than it has been previously due to the FIX on the timer.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is harder than it was before due to the untrackable mobs.<br />

NO: None of these things makes the ring undoable.<br />

<br />
Keep in mind that in most, if not ALL server, you have to wait 1 week or 10 days to per attempt, that you need at the very least 5-6 tries to beat it. <br />
<br />
Fine with Coirnav being harder, but respawn on fail should be every time if not killed. Beating phase 1 is really not that hard, most guilds manage to do it at second try.</div></div><hr />

The unannounced changes to mobs are getting pretty damn old. Who cares whether it is still beatable or not? Why mess with it, when it was already the hardest of the elemental god encounters to beat. The rest are cakewalks.</div></div><hr />

Just about anything is 'doable' (especially for the people who love to boast about their online egos) - the question is if it's reasonable or necessary.<br />
<br />
Was it necessary to nerf all range attacks through the event?  Was it some huge exploit to be able to aggro the minis just like you can aggro every single other mob in the game?  Was is necessary or reasonable to make all the minis (all of which you have to find within a fairly quick time period) untrackable, in an dark, underwater, 3-axis environment?<br />
<br />
The only reason I can see anyone arguing these changes are 'good' is if they've already beaten the event, don't need to anymore, and want to show how 'special' or 'skilled' they are.  My guild's far past Coirnav, we got back off and on just for fun or the odd item - and I assure you, these changes are downright stupid.</div></div><hr />

Killed him about 30 secs before the normal timed timer went off, then he banished us anyway.  I noticed NO differences between the fight pre change and post change... our chanters didnt even use stun at all in the first place.  What were the changes, exactly, besides the fact that the waves are unstunnable, and the mobs arent trackable?  I guess if you were gimping him he's hard, but the fight was normal for us.<br />
<br />
The event is perfect ATM, it's seriously the funnest fight in EQ at the high end level (I havent been in time yet actually so I dunno).  The only thing they need to fix is the fact that he banished us after he died, heh.<br />
<br />
Could you people who claim hes too hard or whatever or that so many changes were made PLEASE be specific?  I know you dont want to give away leet infos but being so vague that no one has any idea what you are talking about, even people who have killed him, is retarded.</div></div><hr />

Could you PLEASE read a couple previous posts before replying?<br />

- Ranged weapons don't work in the fish pit<br />
- Mobs are untrackable<br />

Those two changes make the event much, much more difficult; pulling the first 3 waves is significantly harder.  The time change was a good fix... the stunning thing was an obvious mistake.  These other changes were totally unnecessary though.</div></div><hr />

my guild is going to try not using color cloud next attempt since the patch message said somthing along the lines of - beware if your using stun on coirnav event. <br />

We used color cloud day after patch and got completely slaughtered , the waves were coming before the one we was on before. <br />

the week before it was 27 minutes i think ? <br />

Doubt it has anything to do with it. We havent used stun for it. Still got a 15 min exact timer. and Ill be really surprised if you had a timer of 27 mins last week.<br />
<br />
And ya, guilds that did it after patch probably lost some time wondering why mobs didnt come when they pulled them with arrows and stuff. <br />

<br />
The timer issue was (I beleive) something to do with load on some specific servers.  They fixed that and so the timer doesnt stretch.<br />
<br />
The color cloud issue was the fact that it made a portion of the fight near trivial... they changed the way those particular mobs react to an attempt to stun.  Can still do something similar, just not as effective.<br />
<br />
The non-trackable thing is simply an annoyance<br />
<br />
The range weapon thing... no idea, never was an issue I've encountered<br />
<br />
Doable, but granted... its much more difficult post patch for non-Time live guilds than it was pre patch.<br />

<br />
It's always supposed to have been 15 minutes.  We beat it last time in ~14 minutes or so, with the current &quot;untrackable&quot; version.  The mobs themselves are easy compared to elemental stuff its just the time limit on killing 75 trash+3minis+coirnav that makes it hard.<br />
<br />
Getting ported out after winning definately seems like a bug though. We didnt have that happen at all on test after our last run thru it for reflags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the problem with having more than 2 guilds in Time? My server currently has 3 and we're doing fine. Once all concerned guilds are past the learning phase, I figure Time can support 4 guilds easily without too much bumping into each other, given the respawn time. If you were good you could squeeze a 5th in probably.<br />
<br />
In theory the first guild(s) in Time would be done farming by the time there were a 5th or 6th guild starting there, but there's just nowhere else to go...<br />

That's the reason I can think of for the changes they made. Doing it inside the pit would negate the need for pulling stuff (I think, since they'd aggro you on spawn). But it makes it a real pain when the fake minis spawn on top of you and own your healers until someone pulls them out and roots them, or just off tank them (bad idea). Either way, the changes are pretty stupid as Coirnav was already pretty damn difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this make the encounter harder though? Yes and no, to guilds that have beaten this even a few times it's not really a big deal. By this time you already know where mobs spawn and whats going on with the script. To a guild trying to learn the event, understand whats going on, and locate certain mob spawn locations these bugs do make the event harder to learn.<br />
<br />
Also the event has never been a fixed with regards to when it ports you out. It varies some based on how many people are in the zone (more people in the zone more time you get), as well as another factor.</div></div><hr />

We've only got to the final phase I think 3 times. I was under the impression that those adds just have super fast respawn and that you aren't supposed to kill them. So there is a set number, and if you kill them they don't respawn?  Edited by: Kalledar at: 10/15/03 4:38 pm</div></div><hr />

Man there is no way you are getting a fast accurate count when aeing mobs...those xp msgs FLY by.  I feel it would be safe to assume that EVERY guild attempting corinav has at least 1 person using seq...Now, you almost need to use it if you wanna know how you are doing relative to current time (which is important cause you prolly wanna tl out before killing them all if you are running behind so you dont blow the event for 3 days).</div></div><hr />

Is the tracking nerf a pain? A small one sure. Does it make the encounter harder in the end? It did not for us. We might be doing the event slightly differant than other guilds though. I think thats whats making it a not matter to us.<br />
<br />
I cant picture why they put the changes into the event unless it was to stop some sort of exploit or strat they felt made it trivial. Be real though, people are making a mountain out of a molehill.

I still don't understand why you can't CoH to Xegony, but you can corpse summon. It's just more time consuming and expensive. Isn't getting Xegony key enough of a hassle? Why make it so hard to get to her once you're keyed?<br />

I don't think anyone said it was a good thing to do. They merely said it is still possible to complete the event without it (and no, you don't need SEQ to do it). If it is stopping you from completing the event, then I would just wait a bit. It is more than likely that they will enable tracking again when they fix the port bug as I really have no doubt that either was intended.</div></div><hr />

Even if you were to do that once per week (I dunno anyone who kills xegony even close to that often though) that is simply an irrelevant amount of pp.  We got people destroying lvl 65 dupe spells cause its too much trouble to walk over to the bazaar to sell them.<br />
<br />
You dont really think that the devs, when they decided to design poa &amp;amp; disable coth were thinking, &quot;man we need to suck some more pp outta the economy - I know lets make everyone use coffins to get to xegony!&quot; do you ?<br />
<br />
I wouldnt be suprised if the amount of total plats spent on coffins is less than half of 1% of the total spent on dots + emeralds by elemental guilds - thats where the plats get used up by elemental guilds &amp;amp; even that cost (which is much more substantial than coffins) amounts to virtually nothing to an EP guild.<br />

<br />
Everyone would need their own key if they disabled summon corpse to xegony.  That would require killing each avatar like  30 times.  Since avatar 2 has been broken since pop came out &amp;amp; only respawns after patches (thats been well documented, they are clearly too lazy to fix it), that would mean there would need to be 30 patches before a guild could even get keyed for xegony - assuming 0 competition...I hardly think that is their intention.<br />
<br />
Its just stupidly designed &amp;amp; poorly thought out - it serves no purpose.  Just like the avatars in poa that dont have an indicator if they are up...just like the rings in poea that dont have an indicator if they are up...just like the stupidly long corinav respawn timer on fail.  All nothing more than frustrating time sinks which serve no practical purpose in game and frustrate players to no end.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? Its a group key to start with. You can do it now without using SC, its just a pain in the ass. Fight up to the rainbow, key holder dies to a mob, rezzes in, keys a group up, rezzes back to the rainbow, keys another 5 up, etc. You have what, about 20 minutes or so before the GY claims the corpse?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact of the matter is its pretty rare that someone would fight all the way up there + clear the sigusmund script just to fight xegony - everyone I know has a necro camped there, or flops one up (or if youre lucky &amp;amp; got one bound there before they changed it, just gate up) &amp;amp; summons everyone, without killing a single mob.

Avatar of Smoke can only be killed when PoAir is reset, through a patch or other means of reset, the zone must be reset for AoSmoke to be spawned. Period. But hey, be my guest if you'd like to waste your time trying to spawn it otherwise. It is your time to waste, after all.</div></div><hr />

When you kill him and spawn the projection, would it get banished along with all the raid people? What I mean is, do you have to kill Coirnav, rez people and hail within 15 min timer, or can you get CoH'd  back to his lair after banish and finish the hailing?<br />

If the projection poofs with 15 min timer, it is a major problem for guilds that are trying to get to Plane of Time, and it has to be fixed asap.<br />

We killed Corinav 13 mins after we had killed the guardian and it took exact 2 mins after that until we got ported out. <br />

Waiting 8 months to make big changes is really bad, especially when the mobs are blowable, because typically 8 months after the first kill there is a line of guilds vying for the same encounter. Six attempts per guild x say 3 guilds trying to get him x spawn time x delay caused by PoT guilds taking their turn to maintain the monopoly = some guilds today will have to wait 6-9 more months for PoT access, even though they are completely ready for it.

Every mob? What has changed on Saryrn, Bertox, Terris, Mith Marr, Sol Ro, Vallon Zek, Tallon Zek or Agnarr that has made them gimp? The only mob that was ever holding anyone back from elementals was RZ, who I admit is easier now than he used to be.</div></div><hr />

Bertox was made alot easier by stopping him roaming at warp speed as soon as he spawns. This makes pulling and controlling him after you spawn alot simpler and in turn makes the encounter pretty much a joke because the only chance you had of wiping before was being jumped when not ready.<br />
<br />
Rallos is also alot easier then it once was. The rest were all total pussies to begin with. So yeah, getting to EPs is now alot easier then it was 8-10 months ago</div></div><hr />

You can set a clean rampage list, pull all posible adds, well get a clean fight. When he was warping all around, it was much harder to get a clean fight.<br />
<br />
RZ hard to tell if he changed. All I can say is that the last 2 guilds that killed RZ on my server took him down 2 or 3 nights, but is it just that the event is now very spoiled, or much better bazaar stuff (focus +atk items, weaponry...) ?<br />
<br />
Fact is that mobs are getting easier not mostly because of changes in events themselves but by the better dropable stuff avaible, new AA, new spells ... Emperor ssra has not changed at all, but 40% slow 6k5 hp bazaar tank, Apathy ( so enc can mez more than 1 add) made it completely trivial, same thing is happening with PoP content, guilds have MUCH better dps now when they fight RZtW than 1 year ago, you did not have 16 dmg piercer avaible on a mob that you could kill with one grp, wiz did not all have SoS, ID4, MP4. There was no ornate for 20kpp in bazaar. And now you have lots of VT-level loot that drop in LDoN + all the aug.</div></div><hr />

My guild has only been in EP for 2-3 months now, but from what I understand, Xegony used to be way easier.  Also, when we first started trying coirnav, we were getting 20+ minutes before port out.  Now that we are nearly completing the script, we are back to 15 minutes every time.  Exactly how is getting to time easier than it used to be?  The only encounter which was made significantly easier was the Rathe, and that was so that people could finally get in, but once they changed it, they didn't change it again did they?  Also add in the fact that now most servers have 2-4 guilds fighting over blowable Coirnav (any decent guild is gonna get past the waves and blow it for 3.5 days) and other elemental minis/gods.  Granted, getting to elementals isn't what it used to be (well, just RZ really, but that was the only real hard encounter anyway).  But I'd argue that getting to time is more difficult than it was for the top guilds on the servers that did it months ago with little to no competition.</div></div><hr />

Getting to ele planes is arguably easier, arguably not. Really depends on when and more importantly HOW you did RZ =p. If you sploited him, then it's not easier. Bert is much easier now. Saryrn was always gimp. MM has never been very tough. <br />
<br />
As for the gods, Fennin is Fennin, gimp now and always has been. Xegony, far as I can remember, hasn't changed a whole lot (I can't speak for the very first kills, before we did her). The pull was changed at one point, but it's no harder than it was before. Rathe is much easier. Coirnav is Coirnav!</div></div><hr />

<br />
How long was RZ like this? A week? I'm saying RZ is easier now than he was from say March to May. I'm not talking about when there were bugs in it early on before they let RZ banish people. I think that when AL first killed him, the adds ran slower than SoW, so you could just kite them all. However, that was soon fixed, too. I still say RZ is easier now than last spring.<br />
<br />
As for Bert, I forgot about when he used to run. I admit he's a bit easier now.<br />
<br />
Saryrn, Mith Marr, Vallon Zek, Tallon Zek, Agnarr, Solusek Ro and Terris Thule are all no harder or easier than they used to be, though, and ginlan claims they're all gimped now.<br />
<br />
Rathe is no easier now than he was when most guilds first killed him. AL killed him the day before they changed them to the current version, but most guilds that killed them have done so only in the present form.</div></div><hr />

You dont actually have much less time now, unless you were using like 75+ people. The first 3 waves spawn FAR quicker, so the actual amount of time for the hard parts of the fight arent much shorter at all.<br />

<br />
The actual event itself isnt difficult. If you could take 3-4 whacks at it in a row, that would be more then enough to win for most guilds that get to that level of the game. Its the time inbetween attempts that dulls peoples reaction to whats going on, having a slightly different force on with people filling slightly different roles. In and of itself, I think Coirnav is far easier then Xegony and Rathe, but the wait between attempts of 4 days makes it artificially more difficult.</div></div><hr />

Everytime in powater my right ping always over 2000, but in the zones it's mostly 600.<br />
<br />
I think Corinav may be intentionally bugged, since SoE afraid too many guilds beat the game too fast and need find some ways to block it. Some people just will quit EQ after Quarm lays down under their feet.</div></div><hr />

Thats the data transfer rate, nothing to do with latency (ping) or packet loss<br />
<br />
A number of 2000 is fine, provided your datarate.txt is greater than 2.0 (it's 5.0 by default), it simply means you're receiving 2000 bytes per second. A 56k modem can receive over 7000 bytes per second without a problem.<br />

I think he is referring to the difficulty of trying to melee underwater, especially with mobs that move all over the place with 40+ people banging on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Targetting is not neccesarrily the main issue, although given that it can be (more) difficult underwater.<br />
<br />
The main issue is mob positioning (or lack there of) and the ineffectiveness of player characters to hit anything thats not in the 30% cone directly in front of them.</div></div><hr />

Its quite simple, when the walls come to a 'V' and you get pushed into that wall you are forced to duck, and therefore cannot cast. Its a pain in the ass for everyone.</div></div><hr />

This made alot of the planar zones to lag alot more (server lag) which in turn resulted in longer scripts as well as mobs meleeing slower, spellcasting slower etc.<br />
<br />
They added a fix to this in Plane of Water for the Coirnav event (zone still lags, but the timer is set somewhere else) to make sure the encounter couldnt be made &quot;longer&quot; by bringing more people to the zone.<br />
<br />
Naturally they made a little misstake and forgot to make sure the script didnt port you out after the mob was dead.<br />
<br />
We reported this the same night and was told that everything was working as intended, we claimed otherwise (The GM we spoke too didnt first know what/who Coirnav was but he proceeded to out warnings on everyone who spoke about it again. =)<br />
<br />
Oh and to conclude, i think blowable events sucks =)</div></div><hr />

And thats been the main focus of this thread all along.<br />
<br />
And some of us actually enjoy going into an event blind, going through the numerous losses in an effort to figure out what works and what doesnt, and perfecting a strat that we understand, can change when needed, and that works. After all of our attempts to kill Coirnav, knowing that we did it our way, and that on our first kill, Coirnav died with almost 2 full minutes left is one hell of a sweet victory for us. Its also something we know we can repeat because we know whats going on around us.<br />
<br />
Having mobs poof on ya for days at a time is frustrating. Especially when you know you are so close to getting your first kill. But when it finally comes, its an amazing feeling.<br />
