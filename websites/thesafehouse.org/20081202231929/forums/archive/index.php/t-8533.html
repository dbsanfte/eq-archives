<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_FaldaineBB</div><div class="date">11-24-02, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have composed a list all just about all the npcs in the cells in the Plane of Justice. I was very intrigued by what they might say because you needed to learn and fully master many languages to talk to them. There is a lot of lore, tales, and possibly quests within those cells that I haven't seen anyone post on, so I made a huge list with all the mobs in the three parts of the non trial related Justice Plane. The Top Floor, the &quot;Good&quot; wing (mobs are not Kos), and the Kos Wing.<br />
<br />
Note that there are different floors in each wing, so I labled what floor in each wing the mob was found in.<br />
<br />
Also: I know a lot of the languages but am still missing a few. I will update as I learn a few more languages.<br />
<br />
Not all mobs in the cells of Justice have things to say. If something gives you a &quot;glares at you and does not respond&quot; message when hailed, it has nothing to say, no matter what language you try. If a mob needs another language to be mastered in to be spoken to, it will give you a &quot;does not understand you&quot; message when hailed.<br />
<br />
A few of these mobs could very well be questgivers, and yet I see noone here looking into them. Now that some of them have been translated I really think some of these mobs should be looked into for quests. I have marked what I personally thought could be quest related.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Lanalini, Meridoc, Dareos, Mooshfu, Shatarae, Badil, Lthorn, Ironsword, Ranthorn (you momo), Aana, Rogglium and others from the Bristlebane Server for helping me learn some of these languages. It's not a one person show. =)<br />

 Shaldyn Thunderhoof looks up at you with a curious gleam in his eyes. 'Ahh, a visitor.  Is there something you need or are you here for a story?'<br />
You say, 'i am here for a story'<br />
 Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'Well I'll tell you my story then.  I was once a master fletcher, my arrows flew straighter and farther than any made before and any that have come since.  I was a master of my craft; a bowman with a quiver of my arrows and one of my bows could drop a griffon at 20 paces with a single shot.  One day a [ranger] came with a special order, one that I couldn't let pass.'<br />
You say, 'what ranger'<br />
[Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'His name was Rhionn Leafsblade, I believe he resides here with me as well.  He wanted a magical arrow, a single arrow able to pierce even the strongest mithril breastplate.  I had done work with Rhionn before, and believed him an honorable man, and the [challenge] was not one that I could pass up.'<br />
 You say, 'what challenge'<br />
 Shaldyn Thunderhoof smiles.  'The arrow of course.  Mundane materials would not have been sufficient to hold the enchantments necessary to get this bow to perform as he requested.  I had Rhionn gather the materials I needed, the claw of a black drake, feathers from the Spiroc Lord, and a dracolich bone for the shaft.  I had no idea what he would [use it for].<br />
 You say, 'what would he use it for'<br />
 Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'He used it for murder.  Cold blooded murder.  In my trade sect we were held responsible for the actions of our weapons.  When the sect council found what my arrow was used for, they sent me before the Tribunal.  I was found guilty for assisting in the murder of an innocent, and now I am here.'<br />

 Rhionn Leafsblade raises his head from his hands, it appears he was weeping. 'Murderer! I am a [murderer].'<br />
 You say, 'what murderer'<br />
 Rhionn Leafsblade sighs heavily, wiping his face with his sleeve. 'I am a ranger as I am sure you could have guessed.  I spent my entire life serving Karana, I was a loyal husband, I loved my [wife] with all of my heart.'<br />
 You say, 'what wife'<br />
Rhionn Leafsblade says 'My wife was beautiful, a wonder to behold.  A friend came to me one day to tell me that my wife was killed by a band of ruffians.  I was heartbroken and blind from rage.  The bandit leader, I was told, was a man by the name of Filland Rallis.  I knew [Filland], he was once a noble paladin, but he fell from his God's graces.'<br />
You say, 'who is Filland'<br />
 Rhionn Leafsblade says 'Filland never lost his honor, I'm not sure what action he performed to fall, but he had never committed an ignoble act.  I was shocked that he would take to murder; all of his crimes were stealing from those who had excess, and giving to those that were needy.  He was a [hero] to many of us.'<br />
 You say, 'what hero'<br />
 Rhionn Leafsblade says 'Yes, I have heard bards even still sing of his laurels.  He was renowned for his skill with a blade, and his mithril armor was legendary, and heirloom of his family name.  Without investigation or research I assumed that the rumors of my wife's death were accurate and I set to [slay her killer].'<br />
 You say, 'slay her killer'<br />
 Rhionn Leafsblade says 'It was to be no easy task.  I was no match for him in close quarters, there were few that were when he held a sword in his hands.  I knew that he would be no match for my bowmanship.  So I went to a friend, a [centaur] I had done much business with, and had him make a magical arrow, one capable of piercing Filland's armor.'<br />
You say, 'what centaur'<br />
 Rhionn Leafsblade says 'Shaldyn Thunderhoof, the greatest fletcher Norrath has ever known.  He sent me far and wide to collect components for the arrow.  When I returned he assembled it for me.  I never let him know what the arrow was to be used for, I felt better not to burden him with my sorrows.  Then I set out to [kill Filland]'<br />
 You say, 'kill Filland?'<br />
 Rhionn Leafsblade says 'I went to his hideout, he was out when I arrived.  I awaited his arrival on the roof of his home.  When he returned with his caravan I let my arrow fly, as soon as I saw the gleam from his armor.  It flew true, as all of Shaldyn's arrows did, and struck Filland in the heart.  He was dead before he hit the ground.  Moments after his death I saw my wife emerge from his wagon, he was returning from [her rescue].'<br />
 You say, 'her rescue?'<br />
 Rhionn Leafsblade begins weeping again, 'Aye, she was kidnapped by true bandits and I killed her savior.  I deserve to be here, this is the fate I made for myself.'<br />

 You say, 'what did you do'<br />
Alkus McNeeson says 'I betrayed the sect.  I protected, still [protect], my love.  She failed an assignment, and in the infinite wisdom of the council they sent me to exact our justice on her. It was to be my final test, failure would mean death, as it does always, success would mean ascension to the council.  I knew that were I simply to fail, it would only be a matter of time before one of my brethren would be successful, then not only would my death be in vain, but I would see my love too soon in the afterworld.'<br />
 You say, 'what protect'<br />
 Alkus McNeeson says 'I hid her from the sect.  They were infuriated with my betrayal, and they needed to make an example of me.  Instead of killing me, they sent me to the wracks, there I learned the true meaning of pain, they offered me a swift death for the [location] of my love, but I would not break, I could not break.'<br />
 You say, 'what location'<br />
 Alkus McNeeson says 'They never found her, she died of natural causes many years later.  The whole time I kept her secret, kept her hidden.  When word of her death reached the council they knew they failed, and they decided death was too kind for me, so they sent me here for an eternity. . .  Never to die, never to meet my love in the beyond.  I have been here longer than I can remember, and will be here longer than I can perceive.  My only hope is that one day they will see fit to grant me death, to free me from this prison.'<br />

 You say, 'Hail, Wurgoz'<br />
 Wurgoz tilts his head and gives a slight twitch of his eyes in quick observation of Faldaine, 'You are free. . .  you are not a prisoner of this place. Interesting. Perhaps. . .  perhaps you would care to listen to my tale? Maybe. . . maybe you can give me some relief from this suffering and ease my conscience if only for a moment.'<br />
 You say, 'what tale'<br />
Wurgoz makes a quick, short motion with his webbed hands in excitement, 'Very good! Very good! Oops. . .  Shhh. . .  We should discuss this quietly. The prisoners are not supposed to speak, you see. We are here to be punished and I would not wish to jeopardize your own freedom after you've so graciously accepted my offer. Now, let me tell you that little tale -- short and sweet it is, though dark and terrible in truth.'<br />
You say, 'what truth'<br />
Wurgoz says 'I have been a prisoner of this place for many a year, many a year. I committed a terrible crime many years ago against my own people an. . . Innocent people. I regret my actions, I regret them dearly but there is nothing I can do to make right out of my ancient crimes from here. That is why I need you -- to help me, for the sake of my own conscience. Are you still willing to aid me? Will you still venture into the depths of a dark past to oblige a stranger's -- a criminals' plight through mere lending of your ear?''<br />
You say, 'i am willing to aid you'<br />
Wurgoz says 'Very good! Very good! You are kind, indeed. In ancient times when the Elddar forest stood high in all of its lush, emerald beauty across the most of eastern Tunaria, my people came to the swampland known as Innothule. There, we found the trolls -- the vile, horrible, maniacal creations of The Faceless who ruled that land. We wanted only peace and to inhabit a piece of that fertile swampland without confronting the trolls directly. However, they did not feel the same as we. The trolls began to capture and use our people as slaves or consume them as food! We were horrified and took immediate action against them.''<br />
 You say, 'what action'<br />
 Wurgoz says 'The frogloks came together in massive force and struck at the heart of the troll civilization to dominate the swampland. We prepared an invasion of their city that dwelled deep beneath the soggy earth of the swamp. The battle seemed to sway to the trolls' favor. I, a shaman general and advisor to our leaders, felt the pain of our people as we fell by the hundreds to troll armies. I could not stand to see our people suffer so, for we had come seeking peace. War -- all war -- hurts us most deeply within. I pleaded with our leaders to find another swampland; to leave this place to the trolls who rightfully had claimed the land before us. Their ears were deaf to me, for they saw a great evil in these lands. It had gone beyond a desire for a new homeland for our people. It had become a crusade.''<br />
You say, 'what crusade'<br />
 Wurgoz says 'Our elders sought to purge the swamplands of the trolls. We knew they were vile and truly evil in every recess of their beings, but still I could not stand by and watch a war engage. We were creatures of peace who sought only the betterment of our own people. War was not our way. A troll shaman by the name of Gkerzha approached me one eve whilst I was alone, scouting the swampland. He claimed to approach in peace and we spoke -- for the first time, troll and froglok spoke. Gkerzha claimed he wanted the same as I -- for the frogloks to leave the swampland and let the trolls alone. He seemed sincere and regretful for the loss and turmoil that infected his people as it did my own. We parted ways shortly thereafter, but he claimed he wished to make a bargain with me that would end the war peacefully.''<br />
 You say, 'what bargain'<br />
 Wurgoz says 'Gkerzha and I met several times to discuss plans to bring peace to both races, for frogloks to move to another region of the swamp and for trolls to return to their lives before froglok presence. I was foolish enough to trust him, but he was cunning and knew how to invoke my sense of sorrow and yearning for peace. He brought to me three frogloks who had been taken prisoner and were used as slaves. They were in bad health, but Gkerzha said he did not wish to place his magic on them. Frogloks superstitious and we feared troll magic on us. His gesture was clever. I healed the slaves and returned them to our camp, where they recovered. I met Gkerzha again the next eve and he brought two more slaves and an ancient trollic dagger.''<br />
 You say, 'what dagger'<br />
 Wurgoz says 'Gkerzha said dagger was ancient trollic weapon of legend -- belonging to the troll hero, Tjarduugh, who saved swampland from invasion by humans centuries earlier. He placed the dagger on the ground after he released slaves into my care. He said the dagger was trollic notion of peace. He said the dagger had killed many frogloks in ceremonies and made them the undead that accompanied their forces. He said that my taking of the dagger would assure that no more frogloks would be cursed to walk as the undead servants of the trolls. This was his way of showing a desire for peace. He left quickly without further explanation, the dagger still on the ground. I picked up the dagger with a cloth and put it safe in my pack. I then returned to camp with the three froglok slaves. Later that eve, the folly of my naive trust in the trolls would be revealed in a gruesome tragedy.''<br />
 You say, 'what tragedy'<br />
 Wurgoz says 'The froglok camp in the south end of swamp was safe from trolls for a long time. That is where I took the slaves to recover. I stayed there and had council with the arch magi and high shaman. I wanted to show them the dagger, but as soon as it touched my skin, something changed in me. I brought the dagger to the arch magi and high shaman, and before they could act, I killed them with the dagger -- the 'gift of peace' Gkerzha had given to me. I remember going out into the camp and killing more frogloks there. I had murdered almost all of them before I was subdued and the dagger rent from me. I felt, as soon as the dagger left my hand, regret for what I had consciously done. I was taken prisoner before the council of generals and our leader. As the hearing was held, news of a greater and unforeseen devastation resulting in my foolishly placed trust reached us.''<br />
 You say, 'what news'<br />
 Wurgoz says 'All that I had killed, including the arch magi and high shaman, had arisen as undead and were being commanded by a troll shaman. I immediately knew it to be Gkerzha. The scout said they were heading to the very camp where I was currently held. I pleaded with the council to destroy the dagger, or take it far, far away for it will cause them more suffering if they did not. They did not listen to me. I was caged and thrown into the deepest pool of the swamp, where I would either meet my fate or wait for the trial to continue. Days passed before the council returned and retrieved me from my swampy prison. They said that Gkerzha committed suicide -- invoking the dark power of Innoruuk to destroy hundreds of froglok legions. It was my fault that so many died, they said, and my judgment was beyond their abilities. I was sacrificed and my spirit sent to this place, where I would stand trial before The Tribunal. My fate is more than the elders realized it would be.''<br />
 You say, 'what fate'<br />
 Wurgoz says 'Forever I am condemned to be a prisoner -- I do not protest that judgment either. But I must forever live with my guilt and know that what I have done will never be avenged. Gkerzha's spirit still wanders Norrath. I can feel it at times, taunting me when the barrier separating this plane from Norrath is weakest -- when a new criminal is brought here to be tried. I am so mournful. . . I regret so much. I deserve my punishment, but the wrongs I committed must be avenged.'<br />

I sssoon learned the tongue of the Green-Scaled Ones, and many more besides from other ssslaves taken captive in the many conquessssts of the Green-Scales.  This came to my massster's attention, and it pleased him.  Pleased him as a particularly intelligent pet would please someone, I believe.  He put me to [work].'<br />
 You say, 'what work'<br />
 Librarian Rushal says,in Lizardman, 'As hisss prized ssslave, I was given the task of filing, cataloguing and sorting in the immense and endlessss halls, galleries and corridors of the Great Library, asssisting my master in his daily dutiesss.  I slept in the library at nights, but my nourishment was the [knowledge] contained therein.'<br />
 You say, 'what knowledge'<br />
Librarian Rushal says,in Lizardman, 'The Green-Scales were travelers, and plunderersss.  They bargained with the gods themselvesss, made pacts and broke them.  The treasures that they amassed, the things that no mortal of our plane was meant to ssssee. . .   they coveted, and fought for, and hoarded.  The knowledge that they gained. . . that was the real treasure, but they valued it little compared to shining and glittering booty that they could lay their foul hands upon.  Much of that knowledge made itsss way into the Great Library.  Much of that was learned by me.  I fed my [passion].'<br />
 You say, 'what passion'<br />
 Librarian Rushal says,in Lizardman, 'The knowledge of the planesss, of course.  Those dimensions that run aligned with our own, and touch it, and each other, from place to place.  Like skinsss on an onion, an onion that one could peel forever and ever.  I can tell you about [this place], should you care to hear it.'<br />
You say, 'this place'<br />
Librarian Rushal says,in Lizardman, 'According to the booksss that I had accesss to, this place is the embodiment of order within the universe.  Ever sssince the first mote of ordering of existence, springing out of the chaosss, so too did the Plane of Jussstice exist, to serve and judge the ordering.  It issss said in the Great Books that it shall remain until the end of Order itssself, until everything once again is anarchy.  Until then, there are the [Judges].'<br />
You say, 'what judges'<br />
 Librarian Rushal says,in Lizardman, 'The six Judges rule thisss place, six and one more it is written.  Those accusssed of the mossst serious of crimesss are banished to this realm, their Court, for Trial by the Judges of all Judgesss, the Tribunal.  It isss written that their jussstice is impartial, and absssolute.  The innocent are returned to their place of origin, and their guilty meet the Executioner.  The judges deliver the fairessst [Justice] of them all.'<br />
 You say, 'what justice'<br />
 Librarian Rushal says,in Lizardman, 'The Great Bookssss were vague on thisss point, but it seemed that each of the accusssed, in order for justice to be total, is here judged according to the lawsss of their own sssociety.  From the handsss of their own flesh and blood come the lawsss, and it is to these that they are held accountable.  Jussstice for me may be very different to justice for you, Faldaine, but we are both served fairly.  As for my [crime], I am guilty already and confesssed.'<br />
 You say, 'what crime'<br />
 Librarian Rushal says,in Lizardman, 'I am a traitor.  When the planning for revolution came, inssstead of pledging my arms to those that would overthrow the Green-Scalesss, I could not leave my massster.  More, I could not turn from the Great Library because, for me, it was the reason for living itssself.  Were I to live ten thousand livesss, I could never read every book held within itsss endlesss walls.  Sssso, the flesh of my brothersss I denied in exchange for my thirssst for pure knowledge.  Ssssometimes, one must stand for one's beliefs, and I have remained true to myssself, if not to my fellowsss.  The law may find me guilty, but my heart issss innocent, Faldaine; mark you well.  When The Green came, by brethren sent me here, and here I wait.'<br />

 You say, 'what job'<br />
 Nemli says,in Dwarvish, 'What a job it was, for two enterprising young men of opportunity like ourselves.  Why, King Butcherblock's chamberlain himself brought us before him, so he did.  Dressed us all up plush-like, and told us about a wealthy elf who'd stolen something o' the King's.  He wanted us to find it. . . what a lark!  Well, who's we to refuse the kind of [offer] he made, eh?'<br />
 You say, 'what offer'<br />
 Nemli says,in Dwarvish, 'Aye!  He said that this elf had been stealing from the King for a long time, Brell only knows how he managed it.  He said that we could take whatever we wanted from the elf's mansion as payment, but that the book that he was all riled up about.. the [book] he wanted back safe and sound in the palace, so he did.'<br />
 You say, 'what book'<br />
 Nemli says,in Dwarvish, 'That he didn't tell us.  I heard rumor that it was something like his family history, or his family tree, or something thereabouts.  Who cares, that's what Nammy and I said!  A job's a job, right?  So's following the directions, we snuck out to this mansion.   All alone it was, standing there in the forest.  Being good at our craft, the locks didn't prove any obstacle, and we were in!'  He shudders.  'Then the lights came on.  We'd been [caught].''<br />

 Nemli says,in Dwarvish, 'Aye, like rats in a trap, so's to speak.'  He thumps his thigh with his fist. 'They seemed to be expecting us, like.  The weirdest thing of all, was that nothing in the house looked elvish at all.  All of it good, honest dwarven stuff.  All dressed up rich and gaudy, a Stout I'd never seen walking in Kaladim told us that he was the mansion's owner.  What a lark!  I'm not sure what's going on, to tell ye truth, but it sounds as if we've got mixed up in the [games] of the nobles.'<br />
 You say, 'what games'<br />
 Nemli says,in Dwarvish, 'Games they are, too.  Little folk like me have no wot of what's going on, ye know.  I don't know if the chamberlain knew who owned the house, or if we got the wrong one maybe. . .  we followed the directions to the letter, though.  Nammy managed to escape through a window while the guards took me into chains.  He said he'd be back and rescue me when he could!  Come on, Nammy - I need ye now!'<br />

 Iyalinaoukh tilts her head and glares down upon you with sapphire, feline eyes. The sphinx flaps her wings and rears her head in a gesture of amusement, 'A mortal before Iyalinaoukh? Truly, how ironic this is, but yet it is without just end. Move along, mortal. This place of Norrath's creatures is not one that takes kindly to the presence of the free. Even in this place, our crimes are beyond your understanding and your ears unworthy of the voices that would tell their tales.'<br />

Yalaki twitches its nose, sniffing the air about you. The ratman then gives a hissing sound of disdain and shakes its head rapidly as if to ward off an offensive presentation, 'Go away!

 Quillon remains stiff and lifeless in its posture. The gargoyle creature's eyes suddenly catch you off-guard as they open to look upon you.

 Guardian Ionew does not seem to budge or take notice of your presence. The gargoyle remains still and absolute in its poise, ignoring your presence and voice entirely. You notice the shackles bound to its limbs, binding them together by a two-foot length of chain. The creature is a prisoner, but is inanimate.

 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'My plans for escape are detailed.  I but await the perfect moment, that golden opportunity, that ray of light that shines but once in forever.  If nothing else, I have time to make plans!  Such plans, worthy of the Great Al`Corisalm!  I imagine that you are anxious for me to [tell] you of such things.'  You feel a warmth on your face, as if the figure has come particularly close.'<br />
 You say, 'tell me'<br />
 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'I shall!'  He laughs and you hear the clap of hands.  'Of course!  Before I was brought to this place, I was an.. Advisor, of sorts.  The Great Al`Corisalm, renowned traveler, collector, theologian and revered sorcerer of Erud.  He was a wise one, Erud.  To take on my counsel and to listen as raptly to my sage advice as you do now. . . a rare wisdom did he possess.  Whether in war, or in peace, his ear was my captive audience.  Such an [audience], ah me. . .'<br />
 You are out of food and drink.<br />
 You say, 'what audience'<br />
 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'Can the sun be held responsible for its warmth, with which it nurtures the crops and brings life unto the world?  Can the mountains be held accountable for being strong, the bones of the earth?  Of course they cannot, it is but their nature.  So it is with my wisdom.  The Great Al`Corisalm is wise, as the sun is warm, as the mountains are sturdy.  All the more painful is my [plight], as you might well imagine.'<br />
 You say, 'what plight'<br />
 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'Being a master of the refined arts, my conclusions are based on facts.  A pure fact, perfect and true, is an atomic quantity of beauty itself.  I once said that on a speech to the Low Men, across the Wide Sea.  All of my advice, for good or ill, can only be based on the data which I collect.  The veracity of such information is subject only to those that procure it, I am sure that you [agree].'<br />
 You say, 'i agree'<br />
 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'There are those that sought to bring Erud low.  In his time of greatest struggle, he fought with the ignorant, the clumsy and the bereft of wisdom.  It is in this time that he came to me with a question, a decision so momentous that he could not act without first consulting the Great Al'Corisalm.  His construction of his new city was to be a testament to the pure wisdom of our kind, and of course required very particular and precise requirement for the [location] of its foundation.'<br />
 You say, 'what location'<br />
 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'Ahh..'  He coughs, and a moment of silence passes.  You feel the chill air of the surroundings, as you try to pin-point the location of the disembodied voice which then resumes.  'Erud's new city needed magical channels, certain qualities of the natural bedrock which conveyed that power innate to the earth itself.  It is this power that I proposed to harness in order to drive our new inventions: our water purification systems, our transport systems, all manner of civic advances that would make the new city a beacon of civility in the midst of the Low Men.  So, I sought data from those whom know the [natural powers] so well.'<br />
 You say, 'what natural powers'<br />
 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'Geomancers are they, to us.  Druids are they, to the Low Men.  Yet, I was tricked.  Those that would have brought Erud low placed an agent in the forests, posing as a geomancer.  To compound treachery upon treachery it was my turn-coat friend, Shadalis, that led me to believe this geomancer was to be trusted.  With innocent motivation, I collected the necessary information from this agent of the Dark Ones.  Believing it, trusting my friend Shadalis, I used the geomancer's advice to advise Erud.  It proved to be my [undoing].'<br />
 You say, 'what undoing'<br />
 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'To live a life according to the tenets of wisdom, to insist upon rational proof throughout one's entire existence, and then to throw it all away by believing a traitor that one took to be a friend. . .   it is something for which the Great Al`Corisalm will carry in his heart forever.  Erud began construction of his city based upon my flawed advice and, soon enough, the evidence of the Dark Ones' trickery became obvious.  The powers of the earth that we sought to harness turned against us, causing anarchy, [chaos].'<br />
 You say, 'what chaos'<br />
 Al`Corisalm says,in Old Erudian, 'Such events are not for me to describe to you, there are some things best left untold.  When the final dust settled upon the earth, it was to me that Erud came.  To me that he apportioned responsibility.  He turned me over to the judges of the Low Men.  They banished my form to the ether, and in turn passed on my spirit here, to the Tribunal, to be judged.  It is here that I await trial at the hands of the Judges Which Have Always Been.  That is, unless I escape. . .'  The voice trails off into silence.  A shiver passes through you.'<br />

 Tamsin says,in Gnomish, 'How could it be otherwise?'  A light smile crosses her graceful features.  You perceive a sadness in her eyes.  'I cannot imagine how long I have been here. . .  here, locked away from the one that I [love], away from my dearest heart.''<br />

I was so afraid. . .  afraid of seeing the deaths of friends, my uncle. . .   death became my enemy.  The Eldrith Collective gave me free reign in my studies, and it was then that my need to overcome my fear of my life's end took me into the works of Shadow.  Foolish, perhaps.  Ye would not be the first to call me such, but a destiny is a destiny, as inevitable as the tides of the sea.  The [Dark Reflection] took me in.'

The Dark Books I studied and, by the time womanhood was upon me, I was a mistress of death, able to command and direct the forces of the afterworlds.  Dark powers there are, Faldaine.  Dark powers that course through the ether and the bones of the earth upon which we stand.'  She reaches into her slender, silken robe and produces a locket.

My love, all dressed in travelling garb and radiant as the sun; as like to me as white to black, as life to death itself.  Do ye believe in love at first sight, Faldaine?  It takes your heart in its clasp and makes your soul its own, more binding than any ritual of raising or invocation of the dead.  Such was my love: nature walker, protector of the forest, servant of the Rainkeeper.  The effect upon my existence was that of a hurricane to a dandelion. . .  I was carried away and my [previous life] forgotten.'<br />

 Tamsin says,in Gnomish, 'There is a space in thy life carved by thy actions, and that space can be filled by nothing but thy own destiny.  So it was with me.'  Her expression becomes distant, her delicate lips becoming set and resolute.  'The Dark Reflection had looked for me since my disappearance, since I flew from them so long ago hand-in-hand with the one that had taken my heart.  The Scryer had found me, and whilst we were sleeping under the stars, took me by force.  I was returned to the Reflection in Ak'anon, where upon they did decree my [trial].'<br />
 You say, 'what trial'<br />
 Tamsin says,in Gnomish, 'For my turning from the path of the Dark Studies, for betrayal of their code and the oath I had taken to them in my hasty youth, they were to put me to death.  A woman should be strong in her hour of utmost dread, should she not?  As was I, defiant to the last.  My old tutor, Evazan, could not bear to see such an end to his best pupil.  He entreated the Dark Reflection's Provost for mercy on my part, for trial fair.  So, with heart unburdened, I find myself here.  Awaiting my [end].'<br />

I figured this would be an reasonably easy one to try and see if there's more to it than just flavor text.  So I took my druid all over Norrath and collected roots to give to him.<br />
<br />
I tried:<br />
Roots (foraged)<br />
Sweetened Mudroot (foraged in Misty)<br />
Black Root (foraged in Misty)<br />
Plains Root (foraged in West Commons)<br />
Emerald Palm Root (foraged in EJ)<br />

Lichten Roots (foraged in GD)<br />
Alkanet Root (alchemy vendor in Shar Vahl)<br />
Burdock Root (alchemy vendor in Shar Vahl)<br />
Vetiver Root (alchemy vendor in Shar Vahl)<br />
Mandrake Root (alchemy vendor in PoK)<br />
Valerian Root (alchemy vendor in PoK)<br />
Alocasia Root (poison merchant in PoK)<br />
<br />
None of them worked.<br />
<br />
The other ones I know about that I haven't tried are:<br />
Chilled Tundra Root (foraged in Everfrost)<br />
Moss Root (foraged in FM -- is this the same as the one foraged in Swamp of No Hope?)<br />
Gelsemium Root (bought in Halas off Elona McMahon)<br />
A Root (from the Succulents in OT)<br />
Ashroot (from the Fire Imps in Lavastorm)<br />

Yes I know they dumped most of that mythology but if their including Nalikor I think thats the clue they mean to give out.</div></div><hr />

There's a website out there that has them posted, along with a disclaimer that it would be nice if VI would incorporate it all into the game history.<br />
Unfortunately, I don't remember where the website is located, but that makes a pretty strong case for the idea that the &quot;beta lore&quot; was never beta lore.<br />
They're fan fiction.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, it's basically everything that is quoted piecemeal as 'beta lore' (all the stuff about Trakanon and the Hero, etc, etc.) in its original form (namely, a fiction piece written for Otherworlds Express nee Everquest Express) with a disclaimer at the top saying &quot;This is all made up, none of it is official&quot;.

Some that had no responses now do.  Specifically Grandmaster Xraan on the Creature side.  Someone may want to go through and see those who were glaring in Silence now have text.</div></div><hr />

Primal Black Dragon Claw, but this probably isn't what drops the piece for the arrow.  One way to find out, beware he'll keep the items that are used for the quest, so try turning in this one first to see if he hands it back.  I did a search on Lucy, and this is the only match too btw.</div></div><hr />
