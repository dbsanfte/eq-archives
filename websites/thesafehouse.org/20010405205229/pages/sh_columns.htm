        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
          scruffy dwarf wearily dropped his traveling pack to the ground beside 
          his already dozing barbarian friend. The barbarian, through his one 
          good eye, peered at the dwarf with a hint of irritation and muttered, 
          &quot;Ye move like a clumsy snow orc, ye blasted runt.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">&quot;It 
          be the only way ye can see me, ye blind fool,&quot; replied the dwarf 
          as he adjusted pack for use as a headrest. The barbarian's only reply 
          was a gentle snore. It had been a long three days traveling through 
          the vast Karana plains. Many encounters with the local wildlife had 
          left them both completely blown of energy and quite frankly more than 
          a little concerned about their own skins. The latest encounter with 
          a surly bandit had not gone well and thankfully they were able to lose 
          the killer in the canyons that transitioned the plains to the hills 
          of Qeynos, legendary city of the west. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">It 
          had been more than three weeks since they'd last seen any other adventurers 
          and the sense of &quot;aloneness&quot; grew on them both daily. The 
          rumors of a gnoll hideout filled with significant treasures and what 
          the bartender at the last inn had referred to as &quot;easy pickins&quot; 
          had pointed the two travelers to the western territories in search of 
          the gnoll lair. For the barbarian, it was the first time he'd been near 
          his homelands since he'd left as a screaming toddler in the terrified 
          arms of a mother fleeing a savage bunch of warrior gnolls. For the dwarf, 
          it was the lure of underground wonders and treasure. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">As 
          the dwarf rested on the ground nearby a shade tree, he turned his gaze 
          to the pillowy clouds above and the full weight of his weariness began 
          to settle on his limbs. Fighting to keep his heavy lids open and some 
          semblance of alertness, he began to mentally review the proper backstab 
          technique as taught to him by the leader of Miner's Guild 628. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
          peaceful reverie was suddenly interrupted by a tremendously booming 
          voice that literally shook the ground, </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">&quot;THE 
          WORLD IS COMING DOWN! LOG OUT NOW!&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Both 
          the barbarian and the dwarf leapt to their feet, frantically looking 
          around in panic, both with knives at the ready. After a few confused 
          moments, the dwarf turned to the barbarian with a questioning look upon 
          his face. Silently, the barbarian shrugged unknowingly and&#133;collapsed 
          to the ground. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Before 
          the dwarf could react, the dwarf's vision became clouded and the words 
          &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; slipped through his mind as the 
          world vanished from sight and darkness filled everything.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Welcome 
          to the world that was the Test Server. It's not quite like that anymore 
          but it makes a good intro to a column, doesn't it? Welcome to my first 
          column for The Safehouse. I'm known around these parts as Kezzek Bladefiend 
          and you may know me from such things as &quot;Iron Fist of the Forums&quot;, 
          &quot;That Jerk Who Moved My Post&quot;, &quot;Keeper of the Ring&quot;, 
          or even as &quot;Test Server Punishment Glutton&quot;. Now I'm here 
          trying to help create a bigger, better, more informative and entertaining 
          web site. Whether I'm actually helping remains to be seen&#133; (chuckle) 
          The purpose of this particular column is to introduce myself (naturally) 
          and to give some insight into the trials and tribulations of a Test 
          Server playtester.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">I 
          began playing EQ in the open beta Phase 4 on Fennin Ro. I'll confess 
          that at the time I wasn't really testing anything-I was taking advantage 
          of the PLAY portion of playtesting. Since it was the last phase of the 
          Beta test though, I don't think that was a bad thing. I later realized 
          that just by being there, Verant was able to use player load to stress 
          test their servers prior to final release. Ok&#133;I'm rationalizing.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">After 
          the Beta test, I played on Fennin Ro for the first couple months after 
          final release and quickly became immersed in the glories of Norrath. 
          But, it wasn't long before I realized I missed the exciting and sometimes 
          frustrating environment of the Beta test. &quot;Being in the know&quot;, 
          in a sense, really appealed to me and I created a (short-lived) ranger 
          on the Test Server that I would run around &quot;testing&quot; things. 
          I'd ram my head into walls trying to find clipping problems. I'd force 
          my character into every spot in the zone. I got stuck a lot. (I still 
          do that. Just ask me about the upper mast of the Freeport/Kaladim boats.) 
          I'd try to equip items in every slot-whoops! I can wear that gauntlet 
          on my face! That kind of stuff. It was mundane but I felt I was accomplishing 
          something. And I was accomplishing things but mostly I was just spinning 
          my wheels because I was fairly clueless about what my actual purpose 
          was as a Test Server playtester. It wasn't until I brought over a friend 
          who had more testing (from MUDs) experience than I did that I really 
          began to understand the purpose, possibilities and responsibilities 
          that a playtester has.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Verant, 
          like every other company that creates an online massively multi-user 
          dungeon, has a server set aside to provide a buffer for game code between 
          the in-house models and the general public (production) servers. The 
          purpose of this is to allow the programmers to get an idea of how the 
          new game code will affect the Norrathian world but without affecting 
          the paying customers who don't wish to be (and shouldn't be) exposed 
          to glaring problems. It provides a limited &quot;scale model&quot; to 
          expose the code to playtesters who will promptly try to find every way 
          to &quot;break&quot; it. In other words, playtesters try to use the 
          new code in every possible way even above and beyond what even programmer 
          may have imagined. This is a very important step and it must be done 
          thoroughly because if exploits or &quot;loopholes&quot; make it onto 
          the production servers, there are inevitably big problems. Public Relations 
          not being the least of them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Now 
          what the heck did I mean by &quot;possibilities&quot;? </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Well, 
          quite frankly, this stuff can be exciting and fun! As a playtester, 
          you are exposed to things that hundreds of thousands of other players 
          haven't seen yet AND may never see. That nifty Evade skill? At first, 
          it never failed. NEVER. That battle in the Arena with lions, tigers, 
          and skeletons? Straight outta Gladiator, baby! CARNAGE. Hey, check out 
          that new Cobalt armor! WOOO! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">There 
          are literally new things in the game every day on the Test Server. It's 
          refreshing! It's dynamic! It's really low player population! It's the 
          best of all worlds, right!?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Not 
          so fast there. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">With 
          all these code changes, there are a lot of problems. Sometimes very, 
          very strange problems. That new spell update just turned your Burning 
          Rapier into rations! Whoa, that last patch just deleted your bank inventory? 
          OH NO! That new sound code killed your framerate so the game is virtually 
          unplayable? Tough nuts, buddy, it's going to be like that all night 
          or perhaps forever. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">There 
          is no GM or Guide support on Test Server. If you can't locate your corpse 
          even with the aid of a bard or necro? It's simply gone? I'm sorry, but 
          there's nothing that a GM can do. Your inventory is gone after the patch? 
          Sorry. &quot;Hey, when I zoned into Blackburrow, my Runed Falchion morphed 
          into a small bag. I'm freakin' holding a bag on my hand!&quot; Sorry, 
          can't be helped. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Perhaps 
          most agonizing of all is that the entire time you are on Test Server, 
          you are inherently susceptible to problems every day. EVERY single day 
          the Test Server is taken offline at least once, usually several times. 
          Sometimes it's down for days! Each and every time the server is taken 
          offline, they &quot;roll back&quot; the environment a little bit. In 
          other words, those 2 bubbles of level 40 experience you just got in 
          your overnight marathon session? GONE, baby! You may even lose recently 
          acquired items simply due to the fact that they put that server back 
          online with an earlier &quot;server save&quot; (when the server records 
          world environment and character info). It happens. Every. Single. Day. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Frustrating? 
          It certainly is. Those are just some of the possibilities. Test Server 
          is a very scary place sometimes. Just ask a playtester about the item 
          wipe. So why do it then? Well, that's up to each person to decide. Perhaps 
          you get a strong sense of accomplishment for finding and reporting bugs. 
          Maybe it feels good to converse with a programmer and help them nail 
          down that sound code. Or maybe it's just pretty damn cool to be the 
          first to have the &quot;Ethereal Totem of World Destruction&quot;. (ahem. 
          I made that up. Get back here.) It's different for every person. Ask 
          10 playtesters why they do it, get 500 answers. (See my reference to 
          outthinking the programmer above.) It all comes down to a sense of responsibility, 
          I think. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
          playtesters have a responsibility to take everything the programmers 
          throw at them and work with it. No bitching. No moaning. Just test it, 
          try to work with it, and tell Verant what you find out. It's the tester's 
          responsibility to try to think of everything that Verant programmers 
          haven't. Most importantly it's the testers responsibility to help make 
          this game better through diligent testing and LARGE amounts of patience 
          and understanding. Norrath is a huge, dynamic world. Every little code 
          change can impact the world in multitudes of unforeseen ways. It's a 
          playtester's responsibility to find those ways. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Not 
          every problem is readily apparent either. Maybe through an unusual set 
          of button combinations, you determined how to move while rooted. Now&#133;.which 
          button combo did it? Replicate it! Sometimes it seems like you're doing 
          forensics and trying to piece together the scene of the crime. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">So, 
          you may now be thinking, &quot;How do I get to this Test Server anyway?&quot; 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">It's 
          fairly easy. Within the Everquest directory, locate a file called &quot;testeverquest.exe&quot;. 
          That's the program that connects you to the Test patch server. Be aware 
          though that by patching to the Test Server code, you will overwrite 
          many production server code files on your computer. While you won't 
          lose any items, characters, or such (It's a different server, after 
          all.) you will be forced to sit through quite an extensive patching 
          time. Be patient. Also be aware that when you reconnect to the standard 
          servers, you'll be forced to re-patch back to the production code. (Note: 
          there is a directory trick that helps with the patch time, but I won't 
          go into it here.) </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Hopefully, 
          I opened your eyes a little bit about what the Test Server is and does. 
          It's definitely not for most players who simply want to play the game 
          and have fun. If you're the type who can stand a little punishment in 
          order to help make the game a bit better for others, then perhaps the 
          Test Server is right up your alley. </font></p>
