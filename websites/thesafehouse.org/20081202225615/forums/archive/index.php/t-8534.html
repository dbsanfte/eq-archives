You need (only one head) , a sash, bone, beard for the 1st part.  There are three types of giants, coastal, desert, and forrest, you need to gather the above items from them. Each type drops a specific item.<br />
<br />
The second part consists of killing named mini-bosses. We have killed the named mini bosses in the coastal camp but havent found the named mini bosses from the other two camps. Bring a tracker to help for this. There are three types of giants as mentioned above, you need a medalion off 2 of them. The medallion has to be from 2 different giant types.<br />
<br />
Once you have finished part 1 collect the 2 medallion pieces and turn those in to gain the final medallion and access to BoT.</div></div><hr />

Also, askr is very buggy, it may take you a few times to get the right text out of him.  I have told my people to try turning in the head first, if that doesnt work, have them say &quot;it was me&quot; then turn in the head, then say &quot;it was me&quot; yet again.  Dunno, for some reason that seemed to fix him so you could follow the rest of the quest to get flagged and get the quest for the key.<br />

<br />
Ok, since that's out of the way, don't expect to get these too quickly. Main issue is that the giants that drop medallions spawn on zone up, which means if you're not early morning, you'll see them rarely only.<br />
<br />
So far, there doesn't seem to be a mass keying event for BoT in Plane of Storms, which sucks.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, it seems very important that you trigger all the quest text. After handing in the giant head, it's &quot;it was me, it was me, continue, continue, continue&quot; then hand in the giant items.</div></div><hr />

Then he wouldn't give me any new text, even when I tried repeating previous conversation and giving him the beard again, nor a beard and a head, and he still wouldn't say anything else.  <br />
<br />
Anyone know if the &quot;experience&quot; message means I just need to get the 2 medallions now?<br />
<br />
If not, are there 2 different types of beards or why wouldn't he take this one from the coastal giants?</div></div><hr />

<br />
walk up to fort, look for larger sized giant in the middle with Lord in the name.<br />
<br />
Problem is you have 2 mini bosses in each house on the coast fort that can be killed with 2 good groups. That gets you one medallion. The problem is that you need a second medallion from one of the other 2 forts and they do not have minibosses.<br />
<br />
That means if your guild cannot kill a quad 1500 hitting named giant with about 100K hp and adds that come in the middle of the fight then you will not be getting into BOT (even if you do kill it you will only get 4, yes four, medallions).<br />
<br />
I can even understand this point if they only want uber access to pot but then why even put mini bosses in on the coast?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dirtydorf</div><div class="date">11-28-02, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that it matters a ton, but we've gotten 5 medallions for each Lord we've killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_the hawnz</div><div class="date">12-03-02, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya, it's like 5 medals every kill off lords and named.  <br />
<br />
you should start the quest when you have the head and the 3 items.<br />
<br />
tell askr &quot;what problem?&quot;.  then turn in your head off any of the giants in POS.  then run through his quest dialogue (pretty easy to follow).  eventually he'll tell you about the pieces he needs from each giant.  turn them in to get first flag.<br />
<br />
you need:<br />
<br />
head - random off any giant<br />
sash - forest giants<br />
bone - desert giants<br />
beard - seashore giants<br />
<br />
these are all pretty common, but random drop items off the respective giant tribes.<br />
<br />
when you turn all this in, he'll give you more text.  you can stop here and do the rest later if you want, as you are flagged for it.  the next step requires 2 medallions.  the medallions drop off of the lords of each tribe as well as the named.<br />
<br />
to kill the lords, you have to kill all the giants in the area and he will become targetable.  they all have their own little special abilities, which i'll let you find out on your own.  lords seem to always drop 5 medals and 1 loot item.  their loot items range from really nice to eh..  the named also seem to drop 5 medals all the time, but are easier to kill.<br />
<br />
you need 2 medals to complete the BOT key quest from this point.  all the medals are named the same thing, but they're not.  you need any 2 different ones.  you will need to kill at least 1 of the lords.<br />
<br />
possible medal combos.<br />
<br />
any lord medal + named medal<br />
any lord medal + either one of the other two lord medals.<br />
<br />
it's pretty much a waste to use 2 different lord medals though since it's a waste as the lords are harder, and have set respawn where as named are easy and faster respawn.<br />
<br />
go back to askr and tell him &quot;what bastion of thunder?&quot; and he will ask you for 2 medals.  give him the 2 medals and you will get another character flag.  the first time you zone into BOT, you have to do it from POS.  in the desert area there is a spinning cloud in the sky by a waterfall.  next to the waterfall is a cave full of KOS frogs.  <br />
<br />
invis up and go in the cave and there is a small lake with a tornado in the middle of it.  on the edge of the lake is a white stucture.  click on it to zone into BOT.  you will receive another character flag when you do this, which will let you zone into BOT from POT now.<br />
<br />
the BOT zone in in POT is right behind the POS zone thing.  it's a stone with lightning etched on the side of it.<br />
<br />
hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

As for the sea giant: he is different from the others. You clear the giants and Jeplak, Lord of Srerendi spawns. You kill him, and when he dies he doesnt drop anything. He spawns a level 65 confused castaway in the place where he was pulled from. <br />
(if you hail him, he wakes up and asks if he misbehaved. Say he misbehaved and he remembers having an odd name and asks for it. Remind him he was called Jeplak, Lord of Srerendi and he will remember it all and.. poof. No exp, no faction, no reward).<br />
<br />
Together with the confused castaway, a new Jeplak, Lord of Srerendi spawns in the building behind the one you pulled the first one from. Clear the giants for him to become targetable, and well.. good luck!<br />
<br />
He's buggy as hell. When we tried him the first time he summoned 33 adds right off the bat. (Lost Souls, blue cons, hit for 350), the second time we got 39. He's definitely harder than the desert and forest lords although his melee stats are the same. Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Ocean Lord has a habit of becoming targetable at his L65 version, which means no items/medals are loaded on to him. As for desert and forest lords, make sure you've cleared every single one, desert for instance you have to clear the fort and 6-7 around the corner from fort to turn him targetable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">12-02-03, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, recap here...<br />
<br />
A lot of his dialogue is convoluted so if anyone has exactly what you say to him, post it here if ya could please.  Not even the info on Allakhazam's was right last I looked.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to start the quest, bring Askr a Storm Giant Head, which drops from any giant in PoStorms.<br />
<br />
When you give him the head you will get a 4-slot bag in which you combine a Sash (from Forest Giants), Bone (from Desert Giants) and Beard (from Coastal Giants).  After ya hit the combine button on the pack and hand it to Askr, you will get yet another pack (2-slot if I remember correctly).<br />
<br />
Now take a fairly good raid force and head towards any of those same areas you got the beard, sash and bone from and kill things until named giants spawn.  The Giants you need have 'Lord' in their title (i.e.- Jabawhatzhisnuts, Lord of the Srependi).  You need a total of TWO medallions from any of the three Giant forts there.  Yes they are lore, but since you need them from different camps, you should never have to worry about getting a duplicate.  As far as I was able to tell, the Lords can spawn at any of the three encampments.  I myself got my medallions from the Forest and Desert lords (mainly because fighting those annoying coastal giants is annoying with how buggy they are and how they make ya FD in the middle of the fight with their procs).<br />
<br />
Combine those two medallions into the pack again and hand them back to Askr to get a necklace.  Put it on then zone into BoT from WITHIN PoStorms there (head into the center area with the tornadoes and frogs).  You must enter BoT from this point the first time; after that you can use the PoT zonein outside.<br />
<br />
Info is good here but too many tangents.     <br />

<br />
There are three 'camps'. Naming convention on the rathe is 'desert','ocean' and 'forest'. Each has two minibosses, they do NOT have 'Lord' in their name :<br />
<br />
Faruek The bold<br />
Laruken the rigid<br />
Paruek the strong<br />
Pendubk the turbulent<br />
Solnebk the unruly<br />
Zertuken the unyielding<br />
<br />
Good monks/SK's/Rangers can generally split these mini's with almost no need to clear.<br />
<br />
They're on a timer, so if someone did them recently, killing giants isn't going to make them repop.<br />
<br />
Each will drop 3 esoteric medallions. You need 2 medallions, and they must be from different camps.<br />
<br />
The Lords are much tougher, one per camp. They only become targettable once you kill all the normal mobs in that camp. If all you want is BoT keys, do the minis. And do them. Then do them some more. Keying for BoT was teh suck.<br />
<br />
And once you have your BoT key, welcome to the new KC. Camp stealing, named KS-ing and training to zoneout from deep south are normal everyday occurrences.<br />

Get a couple frogs and take out any of the minis watch out for the spawned storms.  When they head to you,  just run adjacent to their direction of travel.  Sometimes only a few feet.  They dont have many HP DS takes em out.   I have killed every named in PoS with 2 druids 1 chanter and a cleric including lords. Frogs are awsome KIlling machines the more the better only 5 maybe 6 spawn in zone however =( They double BS and have 5 times tankage HP. Crit heals are a bonus hehe. Never done the quest though. The save the tree's quest I mean<br />
<br />
(edit) Hmm I wonder if I can take the froggies into the event, or summon them in after ZI, may try that =) Edited by: Pernicus at: 12/5/03 2:48 am</div></div><hr />
