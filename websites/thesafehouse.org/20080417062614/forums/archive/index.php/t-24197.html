I actually am in favor of pulling no punches, this is why this Anime is so unique that people will go out of their way to say, wow, that is truly something unordinary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree that I'm happy they aren't pulling punches, I'm just depressed having seen that. It was more of an &quot;in another world, where everything is peaceful and lovey dovey, I'd have liked to not see that&quot; sort of statement I was making.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like stalk has told me you have to remember this is based off a game. 1-4 was the end of the first &quot;arc&quot; if you will. 5 is the start of a new &quot;arc&quot;. But in the end ALL the &quot;arcs&quot; are connected somehow.<br />
<br />
In game terms...lets say you can pick 3 paths. eps 1-4 would have happened if you picked the left path...eps 5+ would be like you picked the middle path and so on. But i guess in the real game the option dialog you picked effected which part you got to see.<br />
<br />
Im sure stalk can explain it better but i think its easier if you think of it in anime &quot;arc&quot; terms hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-08-06, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify, its something like, you have a time period of seven days, from june 1 to 8. You go through those days, making various decisions, and the end changes. The people's base personalities stay the same, the story and mystery is still the same. But say, you won't bump into Rena in one route, but you will with another. That encounter changes the outcome of the whole story.<br />
<br />
Something like the movie, groundhog day. In his different decisions, you find out various outcomes and hints that you otherwise wouldn't see in another route. Little by little you use those hints and plot points to figure out what is really going on in the city.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

These are not spoilers, because they mean nothing. Knowing this doesn't help you understand anything other than why it resets every 4 episodes.<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, has 4 chapters. These chapters are often called the Question Arc. They are called:<br />
<br />
1. Onikakushi-hen<br />
2. Watanagashi-hen<br />
3. Tatarigoroshi-hen<br />
4. Himatsubushi-hen<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, also known as the Answer Arc. The four chapters within are:<br />
<br />
1. Meakashi-hen<br />
2. Tsumihoroboshi-hen<br />
3. Minagoroshi-hen<br />
4. Matsuribayashi-hen<br />
<br />
The anime only goes up to Tsumihoroboshi-hen.<br />
<br />
Other related information, when the girls go into a rage, this is called more commonly, Oyashiro-mode, or Higurashi-mode. This term is not only contained within this series, but has become a otaku term, defining such characters as a certain girl who goes crazy in SHUFFLE!.<br />
<br />
The game came out on Comike 62, with only one chapter. Every game since then had the chapter before it, and one or two new chapters, with Comike 69 having Chapters 5-7.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is translated TIPS from the Higurashi no Naku Koroni game, which is one aspect that the anime, the manga, and the dramaCDs lack. <br />
<br />
Read only if you want more clues into what is happening...while not truly spoilers it may lessen the impact some parts have due to your guessing.<br />
<br />
Here is one just to get started and see if ppl find it useful.<br />
<br />
TIP #1 (Have to have seen up to eps 3/4)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any drugs that induces suicide? (Ep. 03)<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Are there any drugs that causes a person to commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
Forensics Doctor: &quot;Directly, no&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;The way you say it seems like there is an indirect way, then&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;I meant to say, there is a way to cause a psychological effect that triggers a person to commit suicide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Hmm...that's even a more difficult way of saying it. Can you explain the meaning of 'causing a psychological effect that trigger's a person to commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Okay, let's take a person that has bipolar disorder. A person with bipolar disorder is most likely to commit suicide at the point where his or her mental state switches from depression to mania.&quot;<br />
<br />
The main difference from bipolar disorder to an unipolar disorder is that the former has an active and energized state in addition that kicks in interchangeably with depression.<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;If a patient is in the depressed state, he or she does not have the mental will to commit suicide. On the other hand, if the patient is in the hyper-active state, he or she will also not commit suicide as they are living an active life.<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;That's interesting. A bipolar person won't commit suicide in both states, yet they are most likely to at the stage where they change from the depression state to energetic state?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;When a patient is in depression, he or she has suicidal tendencies in their minds. But, they have no will to carry out the suicide since they are in major depression. However, as soon as the transition to the energetic state begins to kick in, they start to become active once again...&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Oh, now I get it! They start to have the active will to carry out the suicide!&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;That's exactly right. So that is why it is imperative to give patients anticonvulsants during this phase.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;So did Mr. Tomitake have bipolar disorder?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Bipolar suicidal tendencies involve more normal suicides like jumping off a building or hanging oneself, not like an withdrawal symptom of scratching one's throat. That's sounds like an illegal substance to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Yes, Mr. Tomitake's suicide was quite unusual. So some kind of substance was used for his death. Can you explain the first one...the one about the drug that can cause a psychological effect that triggers suicidal tendencies?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Methamphetamines are known to cause symtoms very similar to bipolar disorder. These are known in the streets as crystal meth. Some barbiturates also show signs of psychotic hyperactivity, but this is less common. This one is more known for helping people with insomnia - sleeping pills. &quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Strangely, the coroner's report did not show any signs of substances.. Any other possibilities?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;If you scratch off illegal substances off the list, then all I can think of is a disease. One suspect in this case is Graves-Basedow Disease, whose hyperthyroidism is reported to cause effects similar to bipolar disorder. However, in the case of Graves-Basedow Disease, there are many visual signs in a patient. The deceased didn't have those symptoms so that scratches off this disease from the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Are there any ones that break out more suddenly? How can I say...like ones that matches the deceased suicide in a more unexpected and sudden manner?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;How about acute organic psychosis? To say it bluntly, a person's brain gets damaged and becomes psychotic. While this can be caused by side-effects of illegal substances, it can also happen when brain damage occurs due to tumors or direct damage to the cranial area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;So there is a possibility of inducing a person's psychosis without reliance of substances?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;You said the deceased was surrounded by several assailants, right? The deceased may have had an adrenaline rush compounded by a severe strike to the cranial area which may have induced his psychotic abnormality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Can you say that in more simpler terms?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Kakakaka (a laughter from a more older person). I'm saying the man got hit in the head as he was fighting off his assailants and his mind got ****** up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Hahaha! So what you're saying is that the assailant(s) didn't have any motive to kill him! All they wanted to do was extort some money off the guy, but they hit him on the wrong side of the head!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two fat middle-aged men laughs.<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;....of course that can't be the reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Ahem. Indeed. Whether by illegal substance or by psychological symptoms, the deceased body itself holds the key to the clue. How's that going along?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Oh ****, it's this time already? I'd better get going or Kuma-chan (Oishi's partner) will start to get pissed off.&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Okay. Take care! Have a nice year!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;You too. Have a nice year.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Hmmm that eps was pretty creepy :P. Altho that ending was bs...I mean wtf to blame her for making him go inside...but it was nice to find out more what happens to the missing ppl.<br />
<br />
Oh and that preview seemed to help with what he might have saw :P.<br />

<br />
ummmm ok that was the most confuseing chap ever hehe. But man that last eps was the creepiest one so far...eps the last scene.....&quot;Actually, I'm taking it back!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Also in the eps you could tell kinda that the whole time she wasn't really mion or shion(sp). b/c a lot of the time it seems that the name was interchangable...hell for all we know they could have been dead already...with that chick who died 24 hours b4 they went into the storehouse...<br />
<br />
All in all its a closer step to an answer but still a long ways to go...<br />
<br />
Altho i don't really get it...so what they showed us in the start actually happened...then she just dumped the body into the well?<br />
<br />
But ya that last part just scares the _($_#( **** out of ya b/c she just pops up lol.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also that cop is a major puzzle...it seems he knows everything yet he seems to stay the only person alive...allmost like he is a tool...<br />
<br />
Edit2: I also think Rena is also a pawn in this game...personaly she scares me the most..</div></div><hr />

So the truth behind what happened in the beginning of episode five gets revealed. Rika killed herself because she went crazy from Mion's torturing. :( :( I really felt like vomiting.<br />

This is really disturbing. Another bad end. Poor Satoko too. It's really disgusting.</div></div><hr />

eh the opening wasn't as flashy as others but still sick non the less. But now we finally get to see who this director is...really there is a lot of info that ties the two chapters in this one. I just hope this eps isn't as predictable as i think it is =/.</div></div><hr />

Wow this chapter continues its trend of having less supernatural aspects in it than the other two, and that is what makes it even more disturbing.  I can't believe the note this episode went out on, I can't wait to see how this chapter is going to wrap up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually there is some supernatural aspects in it. Like when he called mion...our little friend was doing the talking...Altho ya this eps is a bit more tip that they all might just be crazy. Altho personally i think this whole thing could be wrong. We actually never saw the uncle beat her up or have abuse. Ya we saw the scares etc but that was after she had been with the doctor...And if we all remember from the first chap that the doctor is really the manager...It is quite possible that drugs are involved in some way. Maybe the &quot;crew&quot; planed all this to happen. Also have to remember the last bit of the eps was during the event. So its quite possible that the first hole he dug has the body of the female reporter (nurse) in it. So when she meet him she was infact dead already. Which is already proven by chap two.<br />
<br />
We also know that they like to cause ppl pain and like to see them walk around in pain. More like toy with there victim b4 they move in for the kill. Which kinda brings back eps 1 with the penalty games. Maybe the plan all along for this eps was to drive him insane to commit some horrible sin so they could take revenge on his life. <br />
<br />
It all kinda fits the profile. He kills the uncle but none know that so they think he is missing....then prob next eps another dies and the curse is complete...<br />
<br />
Guess they could be showing us that all this does not have to happen in a supernatural way (not to say &quot;he&quot; isn't there still). That a persons own paranoia and sespision can drive one insane.<br />
<br />
But who knows heh. One things for sure...the nurse he is with is already dead IMO :P.</div></div><hr />

Well I don't see who those bodies could belong to from the opening of Part I.  Unless there was only one body and it is is Kei and he is about to get tortured in mutilated in the hospital.</div></div><hr />

edit:<br />
<br />
actually i think it was one of the many dead ppl of this eps b/c the hospital was outside the city and the city was blocked off. This just ended diff from the norm in that everyone else died but he made it out this time. My question is how did that one girl die and why the hell did he survive this time?.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
On a side note it is possible that was his body and kei was some type of evil clone (whatever you call what happened in chapter 2).<br />
<br />
Also the thing that REALLY made me wonder was the Dr's suicide and the cop went missing...</div></div><hr />

After Kei fell he landed in the river, and that must have somehow protected him from getting killed with everyone else.  Also I don't think that the bodies in that drainage thing could have been from the village dead, because the news said they died from gas poisoning or something.  The bodies in the garbage had the intestines spilled out and nails driven into the hands, just like Mion was threatening Kei with back in Chapter II.<br />

Well that is a good point but it is possable that it could have happened WAY b4 kei falling off the bridge. From the looks of it the dead body was days old...but i guess thats not to say it could have been kei's body flooting there for days but from the anime it looks like it happened right after the  gas thing or the day or two b4 the gas thing...<br />
<br />
<br />
That too is a good question....him and that reporter chick are prob the keys really. And this is what sucks about not reading the TIPs hehe you have to base it all on the anime but with the translated TIPs it tells ya little things that where happening in the village that we did not see in the anime :P. While it would be cool to read them i think they might ruin the ending or make it too easy to guess being that there a a TON of tips for each eps.</div></div><hr />

Oh and just remember it starts over after each chapter so its different but at the same time it has links...<br />

<br />
Ah its finally coming together at last! I also found it interesting that they made the voice of the &quot;demon&quot; to match Mion's voice finally. Also finally nice to know how the van used in the first chap fits in with everything now...But the main thing that was interesting is the part when the guy walks into the room and tell's about the kidnapping...Dunno if anyone noticed the little symbol the guy had on his shirt....</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason in the anime they are obsessed with punishment type ideas...I figure this is one of the ways they punish themselves so they can be &quot;clean&quot; again. Also she could have prob been sexually abused and this was just her way of dealing with it. Or the father made her do it but i doubt that.<br />
<br />
But at this point we can only really prob base it as just a reaction to her being abused.<br />
<br />
I hope the answer chap's help with this problem but more then likely you would have to read the JAP game TIPs to find out some stuff that went on during the chap that the anime did not show you.</div></div><hr />

Satoko was in the bathtub counting to 10,000 as a form of abuse to her. When soaked in hot water for that long, you get very sick.<br />

So Satoko was just in deinal about his death? I guess thats pretty common in abuse cases i think. Altho why did everyone tell him that he was really alive but he is in fact really dead? or we just hearing what he wants to hear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's too bad so much is left out. I hope the last two chapters will get animated eventually. The truth about what happened when Keiichi killed Mion and Rena gets revealed in an alternate dimension sort of thing.<br />

I am too tempted to give away spoilers!!<br />
<br />
Spoilers for the Game (DO NOT READ, CONTAINS 26 and LAST TWO ARC SPOILERS!!! DON'T READ UNLESS YOU HAVE PLAYED THE GAME)<br />

I can't wait to see the battle between Rena and Keiichi animated! I hope Deen doesn't **** that up! And I liked how they subtly hinted Rika's part on this whole thing, how the future is constantly reset.

I think the anime did a pretty good job about Rika's part in all this. But overall you would have to watch it all again to maybe come close to realizing this. But if you watched the anime and read the TIPS it would have been easier to find out. Altho i do wish the anime did expand on the whole Rika concept...didn't really like how they assumed that everyone watching the anime played the game.<br />
<br />
And ya that dice roll in TIPs was a good read.</div></div><hr />

And I liked how they subtly hinted Rika's part on this whole thing, how the future is constantly reset. After this, she has a monologue about the dice roll in TIPs which is really enjoyable read.<br />

Dice Roll TIP....for episodes 25+<br />
<br />
I was bored :P.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Last Night (Ep. 25)<br />
<br />
&quot;...............Soon ......tomorrow is going to be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? ...............Ahh, you mean our death date?&quot;<br />
&quot;............It ended up the same way this time too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know about that. .........It's very similiar, but there are some things that were different too. ......Keiichi, remembered what happened before too.&quot;<br />
&quot;......That's impossible. There's no way he could remember, no, there's no way he could know them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*giggle*.... The more you say it's absolutely impossible, ...the more it makes one think that this is really a miracle, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all over now anyway.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is it really over, I wonder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will soon end. Everything, will end. ......That's right, when the cicadas cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
....Is it all going to end anyway?<br />
<br />
The more times you throw a die, the closer the total will get to the average.<br />
When you throw a die 100 times, during the process, even if you get a miracle of 6s coming up continuously, it's still all average when you total everything up in the end.<br />
<br />
...It's just something enclosed by a preestablished arrangement.<br />
<br />
But, if you throw a die 100 times, the minimum and maximum number still ranges from 100 ~ 600.<br />
Even though the more throws you make, the more likely the future will try to converge at one average value, the truth is, the more throws you make, the more possibilities for the future there will be.<br />
<br />
If you throw the die 100 times, you'll get about 500 different futures.<br />
Throw 1000 times, and you'll have 5000 different futures.<br />
Won't there also be one ending among them where I would actually finish from this neverending dice game?<br />
<br />
......The miracle that Keiichi showed me, it was something that opened my eyes and taught me that it's definitely not a waste of effort to continue throwing the dices.<br />
<br />
Don't give in to something like an average value.<br />
<br />
&quot;...........................&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;............That view of your back sure is irritating. .....I can feel a ton of sorrow from it saying &quot;it's no good again anyway&quot;, you know.&quot;<br />
&quot;...........................&quot;<br />
&quot;......It's not just you, .......I'm also thinking that it's not going to work out this time anyway.... ...But you know, I won't give up until I have thrown the last die. Keiichi taught me that. Something's different this time. ......That's why I'll try to believe in that.&quot;<br />
&quot;...............Rika is, .............really a strong person.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah well, I'm way younger than you anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;.........Uun, ...mumble mumble......, .........Rikaa...?&quot;<br />
&quot;......Mi~.&quot;<br />
&quot;You're still up at a time like this, ...*yaawn*..... you mustn't stay up so latee....&quot;<br />
&quot;......I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep so I was just looking at the stars. I will sleep now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please do that.......... ......Good night Rikaa.......&quot;<br />
&quot;......Good night, Satoko.&quot;<br />

<br />
Well that's a good end to the series. There were a lot of things left out from the Heaven or Hell scene that I would have liked to be added, but there wouldn't be enough time. Although the animation was definitely very subpar at many parts. Especially the deformations.<br />
<br />
I liked the part at the end where Rena was hugging Keiichi, or closer still, the pose she had. I know it's an odd thing to single out, but the way she was sitting down and leaning forward into Keiichi's chest was very cute.<br />
<br />
Good end?<br />
<br />
Spoilers for what happens right after this in the game, the same chapter, that wasn't mentioned in the anime... read at your own risk.<br />

<br />
Overall the ep went as planed but really the beginning was exciting but then they seemed to skip over a ton of stuff and just wanted to get to the little fight scene. Its like they said ok forget the story and subplots and lets get to that scene =/.<br />
<br />
And ya the fight animation was a bit messed up and they only made the key picture scene last like 1 sec<br />
<br />
Oh well in the end it was a good anime but leaveing out the last 2 Arcs really make me sad and seemed to ruin the whole subplot or whatever :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well yeah, they did leave it out. That fight scene is the most important and best part of this arc. That's why they were in a rush to get that scene in. It was a lot more romatic and exciting in the game, though. And more worth the screentime.</div></div><hr />

Trans:<br />
<br />
If you'd notice, those days when we laughed and cried<br />
Have been scattered into pieces of something unrestorable<br />
<br />
Only the sadness and pain<br />
Of just having one lie stacked on another lie<br />
Even if we forget the cicadas and scent of summer that follow behind<br />
We can't erase them<br />
<br />
The vanishing place is being dyed red<br />
Before we knew it, the approaching sound comes<br />
<br />
Only my memories that were cleaved apart<br />
Shine unchanged<br />
Within the bewailing of this dusk<br />
Even if I destroy them, you'll be waiting<br />
<br />
They are being pulled off and turning invisible-<br />
Sadness, and even pain, too<br />
Ah, even if we lose the cicadas and scent of summer again<br />
They won't disappear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">10-07-06, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just watched the last episode.<br />
<br />
Holy, holy ****.  <br />
<br />
So many questions left unanswered...but still, it was pretty goddamn amazing.  <br />
<br />
So they just keep replaying that June, over and over again?  And maybe eventually they'll get one where nothing horrible happens? <br />
<br />
Heh, kinda seems like the ending to Wolf's Rain...it all just starts over again.<br />
<br />
But we still never find out exactly what Oyashiro-sama's curse is, if the parasite thing was a lie.  And do we ever find out what keeps killing Tomitake and Takano?<br />
<br />
I'm gonna have to watch the whole damn thing over sometime and see if I pick up a bit more, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind answering any questions. However, before moving foward, it's probably better to take a few steps backwards.<br />
<br />
You may want to try to figure things up to the 6th chapter on your own. I will clearly label any spoilers to be for which chapter, so others can skip the ones they do not want to read. And any 7/8th chapter spoilers will be heavily emphasized, as they may or may not be answered in future OVA's, or in a manga, or in a game that may be translated eventually.<br />
<br />
So before asking about what everything is all about, you may want to ask about all the little things you didn't understand in each chapter that was shown on the anime. That way, you will have a better understanding of how things came to be in the end.<br />
<br />
But it's up to you, if it's requested, I can do a comprehensive summary of what exactly is going on in Hinamizawa, and why. You may also want this, and work your way backwards figuring out what happened to lead up to this finale.<br />
<br />
Just a few things to keep in mind before asking me for spoilers :) Higurashi is an incredible story and I don't want to spoil it for a person who doesn't realize the how massive a question they are asking.<br />
<br />
As to your questions,<br />
<br />
Dahne's Question 1 minor-medium spoilers:<br />
<br />
Yes, June gets replayed over and over so to speak. However, it's much more complicated than that. For more spoilers, continue... Furude Rika is at the center of these resets, it is her wish for a world where she and everyone can live on in happiness which causes the reset. At one time, it is assumed she could reset the world several years previous. But as time went on, she could only reset up to 2 weeks before the events of the tragedy.<br />
<br />
Question 2 Hint re: Oyashiro-sama<br />
<br />
Oyashiro-sama gets revealed in the 7th and 8th arcs. (which means, if you want me to talk more about Oyashiro-sama, it's a huge spoiler)<br />
<br />
Question 3 spoiler medium-high<br />
<br />
The parasite thing which makes people go insane is not a lie. It starts if you begin to doubt your friends. There are stages to this disease. They are not what Rena see it as, but rather a virus. For more read on..Stages are L1-L5. Basically, L1 is where you begin to doubt your friends and everyone around you. Around L3, you hear the footsteps of Oyashiro-sama following you around, thus driving you crazy. At L5, you go totally insane, which is what happens to Keiichi, Shion, and Rena.However, if it's the Great Hinamizawa Gas Disaster.. that's a 7th/8th arc spoiler.<br />
<br />
Questions RE: Tomitake/Takano Hint<br />
<br />
Takano is a large part of the 7th and 8th arcs. So any more detail about her that was not shown in the anime is going to be a massive spoiler. As is any questions about their deaths.<br />
<br />
And here are dangerous questions (for future reference) that spoil the 7th/8th arcs: (contained in the spoiler are just questions, not actual answers, but you may be able to deduce what's going on from these questions)<br />
<br />
What exactly is Oyashiro-sama?<br />
Who is Takano and what is her role in the series?<br />
What exactly happend in the Great Hinamizawa Disaster?<br />
(Alternately, why did Keiichi become the only one to survive it in one arc?)<br />
What's the truth about the Sonozaki family?<br />
<br />
<br />
Some clues on how to ask questions RE: what IS showin in the anime. Try and remember, or re-watch, events that caused people to get paranoid. Ask about those. (i.e. 6th arc event, but not spoiled)<br />
<br />
When those guys who were &quot;following&quot; Rena drove by and asked about Rena. And showed up at the school giving them an envlope which had a number that did not exist.<br />
<br />
Questions like these. I'll answer them as I get them.<br />
<br />
Well, that should cover it. Sorry for being too comprehensive, but I didn't want to potentionally ruin someone's enjoyment of the series. Please clearly label your spoilers (i.e. which arcs, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
eps 26.1+ TIP (Im not sure but i think this should have been originally shown after 26 ended)....I think this TIP is a good opener to the last two arcs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Summer 2005<br />
<br />
The tires of the car began to rattle as the road turned from asphalt to gravel. The incessant cries of the cicadas seeps through the shut windows.<br />
<br />
Most people would open their car windows and let the billowing natural air in along with the sounds of the cicadas. However, people also have become spoiled. They would rather keep themselves cool with the air conditioning turned to max rather than hearing the cicadas.<br />
<br />
Usually rains would begin to pour during this time of the year. But, June came along right into summer without any rain this year. ...I remember that the weather twenty years ago was also similar in which that June jumped right into summer as well.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;The air around this area is still clear as I remember it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Indeed it is. The winds and the sunshine here is nice. Perhaps if it had a chance, this place would've become a UNESCO World Heritage Site like the village in Gifu. What a waste...&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But thanks to that there are no irritating tourists around here. See, it makes it a much more smoother ride. ...Why do tourists forget about pedestrian traffic laws when they are in rural areas? Move over to the side, sheesh, I tell ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Ahahahaha. Akasaka-senpai, do you still do outdoor activities?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Not as much as I used to. There's not much free time in this job for that.&quot;<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Ahahahahaha. Same here. ....Oh hey, there he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The person I was supposed to meet with recognized me and waved his hand before I honked my horn. It was a young fellow on a motorcycle with a backpack on his shoulders. You can tell that he was prepared for a campout with his gears. Akasaka and his partner stepped outside of the car and shook hands with the young man.<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;It's nice to see you again, sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Yo. How's everything going on your end! Here, at ease. This is Akasaka-senpai. He took care of me back in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hello, my name is Akasaka. A man names Oishi was also supposed to come along today, but he had to undergo an emergency check-up and wasn't able to come. Anyhow, it's a pleasure to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;It's an honor sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;So, Akasaka-senpai, where shall we go first?&quot;<br />
<br />
His name is Akasaka Mamoru. He is a veteran police detective from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. By this time, he was already at a career level where he can see his retirement just a bit over the horizon. But, his sharp instincts and eyes have not retracted a single bit. His well-built muscular body and fearless aura against violent crimes can be well seen from the spectacular police duties he has built through experience.<br />
<br />
His connection to Hinamizawa goes back to almost thirty years. In 1978, he was in the Public Safety Division in the Metro Police Department. He first came to Hinamizawa back then while undergoing an investigation for the kidnapping of former Minister of Construction Inukai's grandson.<br />
<br />
There, he met Oishi and....Furude Rika. Furude Rika predicted the fate of her own death. ...Akasaka regrets to this day that he was unable to save such a little girl from her death. He learned of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster on TV and met up with Oishi soon thereafter. They pledged to uncover the mystery of the the cruel fate that fell upon the little girl and the serial murders of Hinamizawa. Unfortunately, Hinamizawa was off-limits to the people for a long time. As a result, the past twenty years for Akasaka and Oishi were painstaking. Their sole reliance were based on publishing what little information they've accumilated so far and the occasional tips and clues from former residents of that area. ...But the lockdown on Hinamizawa was finally lifted. However, they were unable to come to Hinamizawa immediately due to Akasaka's busy work schedule and Oishi's degrading health. In fact, Oishi was also supposed to come today as well, but he was called in for an emergency health check-up at his local hospital. Hence, Akasaka was the only one to come here today.<br />
<br />
The other two were Akasaka's juniors from his university. One was an officer in the Ground SDF and the other was his subordinate. The latter was involved during the lockdown phase of Hinamizawa and was quite knowledgeable of the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
Akasaka takes out a scrapbook from his bag. The sides were all dented and one can tell that this book was very old. Akasaka flipped through the pages, thought for a second, and told them their first stop.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Alright, please take me to the Onigafuchi Marsh first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;No problem. Right this way sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man propped up his bike and waited for the two to get back to their car. After honking their horns to signal that they were ready, they headed their way to the Onigafuchi Marsh...<br />
<br />
When the forest opened up, they came upon a very absurd area where the ground was sealed in heavy concrete. This was supposed to be where the marsh was, but there was not even a single drop of water in sight. All the water was replaced with concrete. ...This was how the current Onigafuchi Marsh looked like in the present day.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hahahaha. Not even a single drop of water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;I was told that they've sealed the marsh in the early stages right after the Great Disaster. This place was already covered in concrete by the time I arrived here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Let's go down there and take a closer look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka got off of his car and walked to the center of the concrete-filled marsh. This was not a parking lot nor a heliport. ...It was just a huge empty concrete space right in the middle of the forest.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;...So this is the place conspiracy theorist say that it is a landing spot for UFOs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;Really? I've never heard of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, that's what is written on occultish websites. They claim that this is the place where our government conduct meetings with aliens. But with such an empty concrete space like this in the middle of nowhere, I can't blame them for such rumors to be flying around.&quot;<br />
Young man &amp; Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahahaha.&quot;<br />
<br />
This marsh was the place where the volcanic gas erupted from back in June of 1983. The deadly mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide engulfed the entire town in the middle of the night and annihilated the residents of Hinamizawa in one night. The town was put into lockdown and the SDF in charge of this area sealed the marsh with concrete.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But the conspiracy theorists have some of their points which can't be dismissed as well. Any geologist would tell you that sealing off the site with concrete is absolutely useless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;Hmm...that's true. I've never heard of anyone trying to prevent a volcano from erupting by pouring concrete into it's volcanic crater. On the other hand, our country is known for doing weird construction jobs with tax payers' money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lately, websites dealing with the supernatural and UFOs has had a significant increase in the topics of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster. It is well known by now that the cause of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was due to deadly volcanic gases emerging from a magma chamber. In 1983, a similar natural disaster occurred in Lake Nyos, Cameroon. This showed that such a rare natural disaster can indeed occur anywhere on Earth.<br />
<br />
Recently however, rumors began to fly around here and there over the internet about another possible explanation. They say that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was just a government cover story and that the real cause was due to a biochemical terrorist attack by aliens. Why did such a rumor began to spread now...? Conspiracy theorists claim to back up their explanations from a secret document known as File No. 34. The name File No. 34 was given by someone posting on the internet message board, but the name stuck since the naming of the file sounded like a government conspiracy.<br />
<br />
It is not known how they obtained these documents. They posted scans and pictures of the documents, but what was written on it were ridiculous at best. Some added their own notes claiming it to be the real thing, so it is doubtful if such a document really does exist or not. But the contents of this File No. 34 is worth noting. However, since this stuff was posted on the internet, it should be taken for a grain of salt as most of the stuff is more like an urban legend.<br />
<br />
The File No. 34 was a notebook written by a nurse named Takano Miyo who worked at a local clinic in Hinamizawa. No. 34 was most likely named after her name. They say that this woman was also a researcher who sought to explain the local demon myths of the area. The contents of this notebook states that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster of 1983 was prophesized in advance.<br />
<br />
According to her research, she claims that an UFO crashed landed in Hinamizawa a long time ago and sunk into the Onigafuchi Marsh. The UFO had parasitic bacteria from space which began to infect the residents of the area. The infected villagers showed signs of extremely violent behaviors fit for the word &quot;demon.&quot; Takano Miyo insisted that this was the explanation to the myth about demons spurring out of the marsh. A lone alien who survived the crash realized that the earthlings were becoming erratic because of their intergalactic bacteria, and decided to show themselves to the villagers to help them out. ...This is the explanation of the appearance of the Oyashiro-sama. The alien was able to cure the villagers with highly advanced technology but was unable to eradicate it thoroughly. Since the villagers looked up to the alien as some sort of diety, the alien utilized its status to hand down specific rules to the villagers in order to contain the disease. The bacteria took a liking to Hinamizawa's habitat, so if the carrier of the disease left Hinamizawa, the symptoms came out again. Hence, the rule of not to leave the village was made. These all then lead to the hermit legends of the Onigafuchi Village. The weird practices and miracles that they performed were all due to the advanced technology that they received from the alien.<br />

Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahahaha. Those conspiracy theorists do indeed have a colorful perspective on things don't they? Remember that prophecy thing by Nostradamus? They all said that the world was gonna end in 1999, but nothing happened past July. All those TV shows built up the drama but it was just business as usual after that. Irresponsible I tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But, Takano Miyo did indeed seemed to have foreseen the Great Hinamizawa Disaster in advance. Look at this page on this scrapbook.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You must be joking. Ahahahaha.... ........Akasaka-senpai, is this for real...?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As time passed, the parasitic nature of the bacteria stabilized and became nothing more than a commensalistic symbiont in the human body. Aliens and the bacteria began to wither away from people's minds...However, it is claimed that the alien lived on for hundreds of years with the protection of the gosanke. It lives to this date underneath the secret lairs of the Furude Shrine. The alien was able to manipulate the bacteria living inside of the villagers body and was able to maintain control in the village all this time. The alien wanted to reclaim the power it once had and began to research how to bring re-awaken the long lost powers of the bacteria...etc. etc...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, things get much weirder from here. Cutting to the chase, the real reason for the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was that it was that the alien's was researching how to spread the re-awakened bacteria in a global scale in order to conquer Earth. The Japanese government had this secret government agency which dealt with such extraterrestrial matters, and they received special training from Area 51 in the United States....etc. etc... And this government agency moved in to stop this alien from it's plan to take over the world by locking down this village and killing off the residents of this area through the use of biological weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahaha! Hey, wasn't there a Hollywood movie that was similar to this? It was the one with the black guy as the lead character...what was the title...M.I. something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yeah I know. Reading this thing to gives me a headache. However, the write of this bunch of bull, Takano Miyo, was mysteriously murdered in June 1983. Right before her death, she gave these scrapbooks to one girl as if she knew that she was going to be killed very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That girl's name is &quot;Girl A.&quot; ....However, some fanatical mystery buffs proclaimed that they were able to track and narrow it down to a girl named &quot;Ryuguu Reina.&quot; Hence, it became known as the &quot;Ryuguu Reina Theory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryuguu Reina inherited Takano Miyo's intentions through her death. She tried to fight against the planned invasion by holding the school hostage and demanding the local police to uncover the alien's plot. Of course, no one believed her and it was assumed that she was in a state of paranoia. Back then, it was assumed that Ryuguu Reina was misdirected into believing Takano Miyo's mystery rants and unfortunately fell into a state of paranoia which lead to her aggressive action.<br />
<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;When she held the school hostage, Ryuguu Reina told the local police that the alien controlling the gosanke was plotting a massive bioterrorism in the near future. And the very next day, the Great Hinamizawa Disaster occurred.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You've gotta be kidding! Couldn't it be just some kind of coincidence?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;I don't know. According to conspiracy theorists, the immediate lockdown of the area by the SDF itself have inconsistencies here and there. Sealing off this marsh with concrete is just one example. And according to some of the SDF members who were involved in the lockdown at the time, they proclaim that they witnessed several people conducting some kind of secret research unrelated to geology. Of course, those who dismisses such accounts brushes these accounts as some sort of precautionary measures to keep unauthorized people off limits of the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;I'll have to agree with the people who dismisses these accounts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;And people also look at why it took such a long time for this lockdown to be finally be set open once again. In contrast, the lockdown of the Miyakejima Islands of Tokyo for their volcanic gases lasted only 4~5 years. The natural disaster that happened in Hinamizawa was one that was exceptionally rare, yet the lockdown lasted for over twenty years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;In Miyakejima Island, the residents strongly lobbied the government for their return to their home island. However, in the case of Hinamizawa, there were no residents alive who wished to return in the first place. Perhaps the government waited until they were absolutely certain that it was safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hmm. How about this one? The SDF members that were involved in the lockdown of Hinamizawa had there blood samples taken in the subsequent months. Some of these members were discharged without any explanation once some kind of result came in from those samples. Some of them believe that they were using the members of the SDF as a human test subjects to see if they would get infected or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;I think they were just checking up on the members' health since it was an area where the gas disaster occurred. Besides, normal corporate warriors also have their own annual physical check-ups too, and they take blood samples there as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yeah, I understand your statements too. But then, here's another interesting theory. There are some who proclaim that there was no deadly gas emitted during the so-called Great Hinamizawa Disaster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;No emission of volcanic gases? How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Basically, as stated, there was no volcanic gas. The gas disaster itself is a some sort of government coverup. It's like that movie made by Steven Spielberg. You know, the one where the humans make contact with UFOs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Now that's what I call a typical example of conspiracy theorists' way of explaining things. So, what kind of basis do they have to say that there was no emission of volcanic gas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, a bunch of conspiracy theorists and mystery buffs came to Hinamizawa as soon as the lockdown was lifted. According to them, the hydrogen sulfide in the volcanic gases should've caused some corrosion in metallic objects and have should've caused major damage to the surrounding wildlife. However, they found no such signs of such disruption, which they proclaim that there was no volcanic gas to begin with. ...But since this village was abandoned twenty years ago, I doubt that they would've found anything to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Hahaha. Well, there's the internet for you. Don't believe everything that's on it! ....Akasaka-senpai, please don't tell me you are buying into these things....are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;At first I had my doubts as well. But lately, I'm beginning to think that there might be some truths to some of these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You, believing in UFOs? Oh come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, what if this scrapbook is indeed the real File No. 34?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;This scrapbook was the one that was in Ryuguu Reina's posession at the time of the school hostage incident of June 25, 1983. It was assumed to be lost during the confusion of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster. However, Oishi's old friend was able to locate it in the evidence storage at the prefectural police headquarters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back then, even Oishi thought of the idea of aliens to be preposterious. ...But after reading this again after the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, some of these seem to hold vital clues.<br />
<br />
The alien part, we can probably disregard these as ********. But her theory of parasitic microbes causing the symptoms seen in Hinamizawa's past, also known as &quot;the Oyashiro-sama's Curse&quot; is a bit intriguing. Of course, there is no proof that such microbes exist, so this still remains at the theoretical level.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;According to Oishi, he says that the gosanke were trying to bring back the old traditions to Hinamizawa. They were researching how to bring back an old but deadly microbe in order to uphold their power. And perhaps that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was an experiment that went wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course there are also information from the internet cannot be dismissed as just a theory or a myth. For example, the mysterious death of the village clinic's head doctor. And the mystery of Furude Rika's gruesomely mutilated corpse...<br />
<br />
There was an underground research lab beneath the village clinic where Dr. Irie was forced to do microolgical research, but he gave into his own misdeeds and committed suicide. ...Furude Rika is thought to have been brutally murdered as a sacrifice for some sort of ritual ceremony.<br />
<br />
However, their experiment went wrong. ...Instead of the microbes becoming the parasites of the villagers, they became killer viruses. And so that is how the village virtually became extinct in one night...<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;For one thing, at least we know that this was just not a gas disaster. We cannot disregard the fact that right before the disaster, one girl did say that a bio-terrorism would occur. There's also the fact that Ms. Takano Miyo made the scrapbook as well. If the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was an unprecedented and unforeseen natural disaster, then the existence of these two are quite extraordinary. And upon reading this File No. 34 there are things written here that shouldn;t be just shoved off to the side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;So...the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was not a rare natural occurrence, but was in fact a bio-terrorist act by some cultists?&quot;<br />
<br />
In the Heisei era, everyone in Japan knew about the shocking news where a doomsday cult group had researched making sarin nerve gas and unleashed its deadly domestic terrorist acts. But in the Showa era, the idea of a single cult group being able to carry out such a terrorist act would've been scoffed at, moreso it would've never crossed the minds of anyone to start with.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Some also say that the long lockdown by the SDF is actually a long research effort to uncover that killer virus...but I have my own doubts here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Hahahaha. Well, at least this story sounds more credible compared to aliens and UFOs. The idea of cultists and domestic terrorism is sounds more rational in our day and age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Or perhaps maybe there really was an UFO. ...When Ryuguu Reina was taking the school hostage, one of her demands to the police was to have them pull out the wreckage of the UFO from the Onigafuchi Marsh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Whatever...&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, you can say 'whatever,' but look. We're standing on the marsh itself right now, and there is no way for us to check if there is any since it is all enclosed in concrete several meters thick. This is all due to a construction effort in which numerous geologist say that it is a futile attempt to contain volcanic gas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Well then, the only way to prove Akasaka-senpai's theory is to find a single survivor of Hinamizawa and try to uncover if that person has that microbe in him or her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Sadly, that is more difficult than ever. After the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, there was a massive witch-hunt scare of people from Hinamizawa (see: burakumin). People from this area are quite mum and do not wish to disclose where they came from.<br />
<br />
Right after the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, there were numerous reports of people who were from the Hinamizawa area that began to show erratic behavior. When these people began to show eccentricities and began to commit suicide in strange ways, there was a massive scare within Japan for people from Hinamizawa and began outcasted former residents of that area in a sort of social witch-hunt. The government was practically useless in protecting privacy at the time, so the former residents of Hinamizawa began to hide their background to prevent their own backlash. (see the manga Onisarashi-hen)<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Then it's a dead end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yet as a cop, it is my duty to never give up. ...There's just too much evidence that points that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was not just a natural disaster. If I can just grab a hold of one vital evidence, just one, I think I can start reeling in the truth behind all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Yeah, but it has been over twenty years ago. The truth might be laying somewhere very deep within the darkness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;That's true. ...Even as I now stand here in the 21st century, but I don't think I'm going to find any answers here.&quot;<br />
<br />
What happened in Hinamizawa, June of 1983?<br />
<br />
The only factual evidence that I have is that Ms. Takano Miyo mysteriously died and she left behind a scrapbook proclaiming that a bio-terrorist attach would occur. A young girl took a school hostage shortly thereafter proclaiming the &quot;prophecy,&quot; but no one took it seriously. The head village doctor committed suicide. The little girl whom the villagers revered as a reincarnation of the Oyashiro-sama, Furude Rika, was found gruesomely mutilated.<br />
<br />
What is the truth behind this scrapbook? Do the contents of this scrapbook really list the attempt to unravel a huge conspiracy? Or is this just some ramblings of an eccentric mystery buff as it was brushed off back then?<br />
<br />
If this scrapbook is true, this all would've been averted by just listening to the heeds of one girl. If this is all false, then who created this disaster like a pre-meditated scenario?<br />
<br />
After that infamous sarin nerve gas incident, the terminology known as &quot;mind control&quot; which was used by the cultists came into the spotlight. In contrast to &quot;brainwashing&quot; which is a short-term effect which forces a person to commit certain acts, &quot;mind control&quot; is a long-term form which is induced upon the victim over a course of time. Over time, the victim begins to believe that what he or she must do is right and acts upon it as his or her own act. It is a form of character altercation which is far more serious than brainwashing.<br />
<br />
The cultists induced fear and anxiety to its members through revelations of doomsday. At the same time, they are also given ways and means to salvation, which began to penetrate within them into obedience on their own recourse.<br />
<br />
This above said formula is quite similar to how Ryuguu Reina became a puppet of the File No. 34. Then would that mean that Ryuguu Reina was a victim by someone who &quot;mind controlled&quot; her? And did some cultists who tried to manipulate her with mind control also try to instigate doomsday on their own to authenticate their own cause? Would that mean that this File No. 34 is some sort of religious text for such a cult?<br />
<br />
As I fall deeper in deciphering what is real and what is not...I reset my mind to figure out if there is anyone might be laughing in amusement at this disaster. If taken that into mind, then this scrapbook is a script. It's a stage script which plays out a tragedy in which several thousand villages loses their lives in one night. It's a demon's script where they observers laugh at the deaths of human lives.<br />
<br />
Who the hell wrote this script? And who the hell performed this? Someone was laughing while it played out.<br />
<br />
Damn it...!! ...What the hell happened in Hinamizawa, June of 1983!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I see...  Then, are all the answers given in the anime, and it's just left to the viewer to decipher them?  I know I'll have to watch it all over again to have any hope of figuring it out, heh, but I don't want to drive myself crazy trying to figure it out if I'm working without some crucial information.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help that I'm not quite sure of the mechanics of the whole doujinshi game thing.  Are these TIPS something from that?  Do you guys know all this stuff because you've played the whole thing in Japanese?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, you will never figure out the true mystery from the anime alone. The anime only gave like 25% of the availble information. You could figure out the mystery to some extent from the anime alone, but you'll figure it out up to what has been revealed in the 6th chapter. The two final, and biggest clues to the mystery get revealed in the 7th and 8th chapters.<br />
<br />
So yes, there are crucial information missing from the series. It subtly hints at a lot of things, but without further reinforcement of the info, it means nothing by itself.<br />
<br />
In the game, which is a sound novel (in the sense that music is 40% of the experience), you just read it like a novel. As key mysteries get revealed, a TIPS gets unlocked. The TIPS often include more detailed information, but is also often nothing or a delibrate misdirection. It is up to the reader to figure out what is real and what is not.<br />
<br />
I played the game, yeah, or rather, struggled through it. Sollon has asked me alot of spoilerific questions, so he knows a bit, though I still haven't told him the final two pieces of the puzzle about the 7th/8th arcs either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">10-09-06, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, damn.  In any case, here's a couple crackpot theories:<br />
<br />
The paranoia seems to always begin with Tomitake, Takano, and then Ooishi.  Could they actually be agents of whatever (or whoever) it is that makes people go insane?<br />
<br />
The swamp being the breeding grounds for a parasite the cultists wanted to use... really adds another layer to the whole Dam War thing :) Could they have been expiramenting with gasses in the swamp, and accidently caused the explosion?</div></div><hr />

Are there any drugs that induces suicide? (Ep. 03)<br />
<br />
 Oishi: &quot;Are there any drugs that causes a person to commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
Forensics Doctor: &quot;Directly, no&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;The way you say it seems like there is an indirect way, then&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;I meant to say, there is a way to cause a psychological effect that triggers a person to commit suicide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Hmm...that's even a more difficult way of saying it. Can you explain the meaning of 'causing a psychological effect that trigger's a person to commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Okay, let's take a person that has bipolar disorder. A person with bipolar disorder is most likely to commit suicide at the point where his or her mental state switches from depression to mania.&quot;<br />
<br />
The main difference from bipolar disorder to an unipolar disorder is that the former has an active and energized state in addition that kicks in interchangeably with depression.<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;If a patient is in the depressed state, he or she does not have the mental will to commit suicide. On the other hand, if the patient is in the hyper-active state, he or she will also not commit suicide as they are living an active life.<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;That's interesting. A bipolar person won't commit suicide in both states, yet they are most likely to at the stage where they change from the depression state to energetic state?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;When a patient is in depression, he or she has suicidal tendencies in their minds. But, they have no will to carry out the suicide since they are in major depression. However, as soon as the transition to the energetic state begins to kick in, they start to become active once again...&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Oh, now I get it! They start to have the active will to carry out the suicide!&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;That's exactly right. So that is why it is imperative to give patients anticonvulsants during this phase.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;So did Mr. Tomitake have bipolar disorder?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Bipolar suicidal tendencies involve more normal suicides like jumping off a building or hanging oneself, not like an withdrawal symptom of scratching one's throat. That's sounds like an illegal substance to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Yes, Mr. Tomitake's suicide was quite unusual. So some kind of substance was used for his death. Can you explain the first one...the one about the drug that can cause a psychological effect that triggers suicidal tendencies?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Methamphetamines are known to cause symtoms very similar to bipolar disorder. These are known in the streets as crystal meth. Some barbiturates also show signs of psychotic hyperactivity, but this is less common. This one is more known for helping people with insomnia - sleeping pills. &quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Strangely, the coroner's report did not show any signs of substances.. Any other possibilities?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;If you scratch off illegal substances off the list, then all I can think of is a disease. One suspect in this case is Graves-Basedow Disease, whose hyperthyroidism is reported to cause effects similar to bipolar disorder. However, in the case of Graves-Basedow Disease, there are many visual signs in a patient. The deceased didn't have those symptoms so that scratches off this disease from the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Are there any ones that break out more suddenly? How can I say...like ones that matches the deceased suicide in a more unexpected and sudden manner?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;How about acute organic psychosis? To say it bluntly, a person's brain gets damaged and becomes psychotic. While this can be caused by side-effects of illegal substances, it can also happen when brain damage occurs due to tumors or direct damage to the cranial area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;So there is a possibility of inducing a person's psychosis without reliance of substances?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;You said the deceased was surrounded by several assailants, right? The deceased may have had an adrenaline rush compounded by a severe strike to the cranial area which may have induced his psychotic abnormality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Can you say that in more simpler terms?&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Kakakaka (a laughter from a more older person). I'm saying the man got hit in the head as he was fighting off his assailants and his mind got ****** up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Hahaha! So what you're saying is that the assailant(s) didn't have any motive to kill him! All they wanted to do was extort some money off the guy, but they hit him on the wrong side of the head!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two fat middle-aged men laughs.<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;....of course that can't be the reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Ahem. Indeed. Whether by illegal substance or by psychological symptoms, the deceased body itself holds the key to the clue. How's that going along?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;Oh ****, it's this time already? I'd better get going or Kuma-chan (Oishi's partner) will start to get pissed off.&quot;<br />
<br />
FD: &quot;Okay. Take care! Have a nice year!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oishi: &quot;You too. Have a nice year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scrapbook II (Ep. 06)<br />
<br />
 &lt;The Sacrifice Ritual&gt;<br />
<br />
The Sacrifice Ritual was carried out very simply: by drowning. The victim was drowned into the scared site called the Onigafuchi Marsh.<br />
<br />
One of the most unique aspects is that in Onigafuchi village, the victim was slowly drowned into the marsh over the course of three days and three nights. This was perhaps because the point of the ritual was not to &quot;kill,&quot; but was a pun to &quot;put down.&quot; (&quot;put down&quot; meaning to putting the victim down into the marsh and to putting down/quelling the evil spirits)<br />
<br />
Considering this theory, there must've been many methods and ideas that were conceived to slow the drowning of the victim into the marsh. Unfortunately, no record exists on what kinds of methods were used for that ritual.<br />
<br />
My theory is that they used a log as a mini-boat and used it as an altar, tied the victim up with ropes, and slowly lowered the victim down into the marsh according to the day of the time. However, if that was the case, such contraptions must be safely stored somewhere as a &quot;saigu.&quot; (&quot;saigu&quot; literally means &quot;festivity item.&quot; This term will come up over an over again, so it will be much easier to remember this terminology)<br />
__________________<br />

Scrapbook III (Ep. 06)<br />
<br />
&lt;Saigus used at the rituals&gt;<br />
<br />
The ritual equipments used are known as &quot;saigu,&quot; and are safely locked away at the Furude Shrine and in the storages of the other gosanke.<br />
<br />
However, these &quot;saigu&quot; are all of contemporary form and none of them reveal the true nature of the dark history of the Onigafuchi village. Had these been lost along with the rituals when the era changed from the end of the Edo period to Meiji? I do not believe so. I sternly believe that the real &quot;saigus&quot; used during the nights of Onikakushi and sacrificial rituals still exist. They exist right here and now, at somewhere in this village of Hinamizawa.<br />
<br />
I have 90% certainty where they might be stored. For some reason starting from this year, the place that I suspect stores these items have been changed from a tightly secured lock to a simple padlock. I'm pretty sure that such a cheap lock can be picked open very easily by that man.<br />
<br />
However, the village meetings are held very close to that location with high human activity. But I do not give up. The night where all of Hinamizawa will be attending is approaching. That is the prime time to go under the darkness as a blindspot.<br />
<br />
It's almost the time for Watanagashi.<br />
<br />
Scrapbook VII (Ep. 06)<br />
<br />
&lt;The gosanke&gt;<br />
<br />
The gosanke signifies the three most powerful families that controlled matters in Onigafuchi village.<br />
<br />
These three are the Kimiyoshi Family, the Furude Family, and the Sonozaki Family. All three exist to this present day. (Even though they do not wield that much power as historically written, they still weigh tremendous influence within the region to this day). The gosanke are said to have inherited the highest concentration of the demons' blood in their bloodline.<br />
<br />
&lt;The Kimiyoshi Family&gt;<br />
Formerly, the Kimiyoshi Family was the strongest and held the leadership position within the gosanke. However, it seems that they have lost influence in the present time.<br />
<br />
The current village chief (Kimiyoshi Kiichirou) is a member of this family. It is believed that this is the reason why the Kimiyoshi family always held the position of the village chief before the idea of elections were introduced. Of course, since there are no other candidates, there hasn't been any change for the Kimiyoshi family being the head of the village even in our post-war era.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;The Furude Family&gt;<br />
They have been the center of faith, and they are responsible for the preservation of the shrine to respect the Oyashiro-sama. They have been revered as the spokesperson for the voice of Oyashiro-sama. However many of their branches had died off during the war, and only the main branch of their household exist today. Furthermore, the only living person of this family is a single female child (Furude Rika), and it is in danger of going into extinction.<br />
<br />
There seems to be custom of especially revering the female member of the Furude line, so many of the elderly villagers take a huge reverance to Rika.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;The Sonozaki Family&gt;<br />
They are believed to be the enforcers of the practice and customs for Onigafuchi village. They were among the weakest of the gosanke, and were always the last to be addressed. However, it is interesting to note that this power balance has shifted in the present times as they wield the largest influence within all of the gosanke. It is safe to say that they now control all the matters and decisions of Hinamizawa.<br />
<br />
The three gosanke must agree upon a matter to take action, but this is just in practice only. In reality, all the decisions are handled by the current head of the family, Sonozaki Oryou.<br />
<br />
Scrapbook VIII (Ep. 07)<br />
<br />
&lt;The gosanke in the present day&gt;<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, the current gosanke meetings are in name only as the dictatorial powers are vested by the Sonozaki family. The Kimiyoshi and the Furude families had not retained the strengths that they used to have, nor do they seem to have the desire to hold onto to their ancestors' traditions.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the Sonozaki family has held a firm grasp onto their beliefs, traditions, and power to this date. It is assumed that the most recent &quot;Watanagashi&quot; incident reported back in the end of the Meiji era was also under the supervision of the Sonozaki family head at that time. (see family tree of the gosanke families at the end of Meiji era) The Sonozaki family gained further influence in Hinamizawa as they took the leadership role of helping its economy.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, while the chairman for the group against the dam contruction project several years ago was lead by the Kimiyoshi family, it known that the Sonozaki family were the real leaders in this massive demonstration. As the Kimiyoshi family fought against the project through legal and civil means, it is rumored that the Sonozaki family aided the anti-dam construction effort through dark and shady methods. Most of Hinamizawa do not doubt that the numerous subversive activities during the anti-contruction demonstrations were carried out by the Sonozakis. For example, one of the most well known incident that many believe that the Sonozakis were behind it was the kidnapping and extortion of the Minister of Contruction's grandson.<br />
<br />
Henceforth, it is touted that the recent murder-homicides were executed by the Sonozaki family. These murder-homicides symbolizes a revival of the old &quot;Watanagashi&quot; festival. Perhaps they are trying to make the villagers remember the rules and traditions of the old Onigafuchi village by carrying out these &quot;watanagashis&quot; on the day of the Watanagashi Festival?<br />
<br />
More research on the Sonozaki family will be necessary to complete the research on this subject. Should entering the Furude Shrine's warehouse be successful, I shall focus my next attention towards the Sonozaki family. Although the security around the Sonozaki household complex is very secure with surveillance cameras and the like, I am fortunate enough to know members of the Sonozoki family, the heiress Mion and her twin sister Shion. I would like to utilize this connection to further my research.<br />

Copy of Initial Autopsy Report (Ep. 09)<br />
<br />
 According to the autopy report, the victim was murdered in the following manner:<br />
<br />
<br />
(1) Full body was strapped by a restraining device<br />
Upon inspection of the bruises on the body, it seems that the entire body was put onto specialized restraining device. The bruises on her fingers stand out so it is highly possible that this device was of a custom or home made device.<br />
<br />
<br />
(2) Both ears and nose cut off by a sharpened object<br />
Due to the different types of bruises, it is surmised that there was one or more persons to hold her down on the victim's neck as the facial parts were cut off. It is possible that more than one object were used, and one of those objects have a high possibility of being a scissor.<br />
<br />
<br />
(3) Nails driven through the fingers of both hands<br />
Both of the victims hands had one nail driven through each of the finger joints; totalling 30 nails. The body was found with the nail-driven hands strapped to a wooden board about 20 square centimeters. This board has a high possibility of being a part of the restraining device. And it is a highly suspected that this device was built for this exact purpose.<br />
<br />
<br />
(4) Stomach cut open, intestines torn out<br />
It is possible that the stomach was cut open with a sharp object like a medical surgery. There is no doubt that the victim was still alive at this point. The intestines and internal organs were then pulled and torn out. This was the main cause of death of the victim.<br />
<br />
<br />
(5) Corpse abandonment<br />
Dumbbells were tied to the pet collar and was strapped to the victim's neck. The body was then abandoned into the third channel of Tamagokawa River. By taking into account of the weights of the dumbbells, three men would've been necessary to abandon the body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To Oishi-san:<br />
<br />
This is the copy of the initial autopsy report that you requested for the Tamagokawa Corpse Mutilation case. Section Chief Shigeharu says that this could be related to Type-S cases. What do you think, Oishi-san?<br />
<br />
Research Note II (Ep. 13)<br />
<br />
&lt;About the Oyashiro-sama&gt;<br />
<br />
It is not known how the word Oyashiro-sama is spelled. However, this may also be the result of how the translation of its name had changed subtlely over the course of history. Hence, it is quite difficult to find whether or not this name is indeed correct to begin with.<br />
<br />
In fact, the the only thing that is common in its history is that the readability of the four words O-YA-SHI-RO.<br />
<br />
One theory states that the &quot;&#31038;&quot; (see footnote 1) that houses the Oyashiro-sama itself became a subject of worship, and that is why it became to be known as &quot;&#24481;&#31038;&#12373;&#12414;&quot; (see footnote 2). However, this theory is rather bland and boring.<br />
<br />
While the following information may or may not be related to the above said matter, it is said that the noble Furude family has the bloodline of the Oyashiro-sama flowing within them. And according to the Furude family legend, it is said that if the first child that is born is a female after eight generations, that daughter in the eight generation will be the reincarnation of the Oyashiro-sama itself.<br />
<br />
If one takes this legend into consideration, it seems the correct way to spell Oyashiro-sama is &quot;&#24481;&#20843;&#20195;&#12373;&#12414;&quot; (see footnote 3). (Of course, this spelling is just my own theory so there is no way of knowing for sure).<br />
<br />
If such is the case, then the naming of the Oyashiro-sama is made under the premise of resurrection. Worshiping a deity under the pretense of its resurrection can be seen in many religions, so this is not rare. However, it is also interesting to note that several religions associate the resurrection of their deity with the &quot;apocalypse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Furude Rika, the cute little girl where all the village elders seem to take care of her with special treatment. ...There are rumors that she is the eighth generation &quot;Oyashiro-sama.&quot; While I do not known the precise details of the Furude family tree, I do know that the first child of the past two generations were female.<br />
<br />
Furude Rika, the little girl who looks over to protect Hinamizawa. What would happen if Hinamizawa loses her divine protection? What would happen if the tranquility between the humans and the demons were to wither away? Would all hell break loose once again as human-eating demons begin to engulf the village?<br />
<br />
Weak and powerless humans cry and scream as the demons feast and remember what it was like to be their former selves.<br />
<br />
...I wonder what a spectacle that would be. My heart pounds in excitement just imagining what it would be like.<br />
<br />
The Great Hinamizawa Disaster (Epilogue Ep. 13)<br />
<br />
Early dawn June 22, 1983<br />
<br />
XX Prefecture, Shishibone County, Hinamizawa village  a wide spread disaster has occurred.<br />
&#12288;<br />
From one of the Hinamizawa districts water sources, Onigafuchi Swamp, has emitted volcanic gases (hydrogen sulphide &amp; carbon dioxide) that shrouded the entire village.<br />
<br />
&#12288;Over 1,200 victims confirmed.<br />
<br />
&#12288;Over 20 people reported missing.<br />
<br />
Approximately 600,000 people were evacuated from the surrounding communities, making this an unprecedented catastrophe.<br />
<br />
Later investigations showed that directly under Onigafuchi Swamp, there was a magma reservoir and hot springs;<br />
<br />
Leading to the conclusion the erupted gases causing this disaster originated from here.<br />
<br />
In addition, immediately after the disasters occurrence, one after another people claimed the disaster as the Curse in accordance to Hinamizawa folklore stirring early confusion.<br />
<br />
In Hinamizawa, when a curse is set, noxious gas said to erupt and wipe out the village accordance to folklore;<br />
<br />
Leading scholars to believe in the past a similar gas eruption happened and has remained as folklore.<br />
<br />
One particular fanatical weekly magazine reports, that this is a mere extension to the bizarre deaths which has spanned the past several years in Hinamizawa village, aggregating it as the Oyashiro-sama Curse Theory.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the relatives of the Hinamizawa citizens who escaped the disaster complained of failing physical health and were hospitalized one after another following the disaster;<br />
<br />
Among a portion of them, past away from an unknown disease, further escalating the chaos.<br />
<br />
On top of that, few of the relatives self proclaimed they were possessed by Oyashiro-samas Curse and committed suicide in such outrageous ways,<br />
<br />
...there was no longer any way to stop the wide-spread shock over the nation.<br />
<br />
The delusion of poisonous gas seeping in the dead of night silently, sparked fear across the entire Japanese nation;<br />
<br />
Resulting increasing complaints of sleeplessness, troubled breathing, headaches, dizziness, etc.<br />
<br />
Amongst them, few proclaimed they were possessed, and committed to odd behaviors.<br />
<br />
This is likely due to subjective influence from radical information, however,<br />
<br />
...later, this mental distress caused by the Hinamizawa Catastrophe elevated to an epidemic dubbing this condition as the Hinamizawa Syndrome...<br />
<br />
Targeted by various rumors and speculations, presently the Hinamizawa district has been restricted and even flight over the area has been prohibited.<br />
<br />
As the gases level dropped, and the restriction was lifted, however, in the Fall of the same year once more a gas outbreak was confirmed, and the surrounding area was again restricted.<br />
<br />
Local stories tell the rotting village still has the remains of civilization, as if in a coma sleeping continuously...<br />
<br />
In the end there was a lone survivor, a male living at Hinamizawa XXXX block, Maebara Keiichi (1X).<br />
<br />
At the time of rescue, he had trouble breathing suffering from pulmonary edema due to the gasses, however, from grave rescue efforts his life been saved.<br />
<br />
Presently he is hospitalized in the general hospital within the prefecture.&#12288;<br />
<br />
Several reporters have tried pursing for an interview daily, but all were refused.<br />
<br />
......What did he see at Hinamizawa?<br />
<br />
From 6/21 to 6/22, what happen in Hinamizawa?<br />
<br />
Even to this day, he has continued to keep his silence.<br />

Box Selection Game (Ep. 14)<br />
<br />
Do you think there is such a thing as choices in life?<br />
There are a lot of people who lament.<br />
They say &quot;if clear choices were set up at various turnpoints in my life, then I would've been able to gauge them carefully, and guide myself to a better future.&quot;<br />
<br />
...Whenever I hear lamentations like that, I would think &quot;what a pointless worry&quot;.<br />
Even if we were given choices to select from, it won't have any meanings anyway, nor does that help us guide ourselves to a better future.<br />
<br />
......You don't understand?<br />
Well then, as an example, let's put two odd-looking boxes in front of you.<br />
<br />
And then, let's say you are now given two choices.<br />
That is, do you open the red box? Or do you open the blue box?<br />
<br />
You would probably be indecisive, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;If I have to open one, be it red or blue, I would want to open the one that's better for me&quot;, it's a very natural desire to wish for that.<br />
And then, after considering various factors such as the boxes' shape and feel, and after much contemplation, you would finally pick one of the boxes.<br />
<br />
.........Which box would you pick?<br />
<br />
Red and blue.<br />
...If we were to follow the rules of the traffic signals, then red means danger.<br />
But that doesn't mean blue would guarantee safety either.<br />
Who knows, it might actually be a trap to make you feel cautious about the red box, so that you would open the blue box.<br />
<br />
Trap?<br />
...Is it possible that the contents within the boxes are not gains, but actually something that causes a loss instead...?<br />
<br />
Now then... you're becoming more and more indecisive now.<br />
Torn between the choice of red and blue, ...you must be beginning to hope for a choice to leave this place without opening any boxes at all.<br />
<br />
But nope. You must open one of the boxes.<br />
Ah, I almost forgot to mention this, but once you pick a box, the other box will disappear.<br />
So you'll have no way of knowing what was in the box that you didn't pick. Just to let you know that we have this rule, okay?<br />
<br />
Now then. Want to take your pick?<br />
The red box? Or the blue box?<br />
<br />
Notebook Page 21 (Ep. 16)<br />
<br />
Let's examine the conversation I had with that strange girl in the rain here.<br />
<br />
Ryugu Rena.<br />
Her real name is Ryugu Reina.<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure about the true identity of this girl.<br />
<br />
The one thing I know for sure is that she doesn't have any connections with the Sonozaki main family.<br />
Of course, she doesn't have any relationships with any of the Gosanke either.<br />
<br />
It's true that the Ryugu family had lived in Hinamizawa in the past.<br />
After that, about her family moving to Ibaraki, it's just as she said herself.<br />
<br />
They moved to Ibaraki just before she entered elementary school, ......and after that, they returned to Hinamizawa.<br />
<br />
Ryugu Rena herself stated that she returned to Hinamizawa after receiving a warning (curse?) from Oyashiro-sama.<br />
<br />
It is unclear what she's referring to by this.<br />
She claims to have received &#12300;Oyashiro-sama's Curse&#12301; once before.<br />
<br />
Saying that Oyashiro-sama would constantly watch her, and follow behind her steadily.<br />
<br />
I think it's probably just some kind of self-victimizing delusion, but ....Strangely, those experiences have drawn a lot of interest from Satoshi-kun.<br />
<br />
According to her, at this point in time, Satoshi-kun too is beginning to receive Oyashiro-sama's Curse as well.<br />
<br />
It appears that Satoshi-kun has confessed to this girl about how he is being followed by some unknown entity as well.<br />
<br />
And then, it appears he became very shocked at how her &#12300;experience story&#12301; matched his own.<br />
<br />
What is Oyashiro-sama's Curse...?<br />
Why did Rena and Satoshi-kun share a common experience?<br />
<br />
It seems to me like this is most likely referring to some kind of surveillance by someone in the village.<br />
They must be monitoring the movements of the victims for this year's curse.<br />
<br />
......For Satoshi-kun and Rena, who blindly believes in Oyashiro-sama's Curse, the surveillance must've felt like Oyashiro-sama's presence to them.<br />
Combined with self-victimizing delusions, it's not unreasonable for them to be feeling like they're experiencing abnormal experiences.<br />
<br />
In other words, from the information that Rena has brought me, we can surmise that Satoshi-kun appears to have already been placed under surveillance long before Watanagashi.<br />
<br />
If that's the case, then one question arises at this point.<br />
<br />
And that is the meaning of the &#12300;surveillance&#12301; that Rena received.<br />
<br />
I have assumed that this surveillance is performed on the victims of the year.<br />
But, if that's the case, then I don't understand the meaning of the surveillance against Rena.<br />
<br />
She lived in a land far away that's different from Hinamizawa. What meaning was there when they observed her?<br />
<br />
If we were to define her as a villager who deserted her homeland, then yes, it's still understandable if she were to be met by the curse.<br />
<br />
However, ...In the end, she didn't become a victim.<br />
Perhaps she was pardoned after deciding to move back to Hinamizawa.<br />
<br />
...It feels like she still knows about something that I don't know about....<br />
<br />
Notebook Page 50 (Ep. 18)(H)<br />
<br />
(note: this note is written after Shion met Takano for the first time in the library)<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
I have been in contact with Takano Miyo for a while after that.<br />
<br />
Her true nature lies in her interest for the bizzare, as well as a curious mind that's just as eccentric.<br />
<br />
That's why I have to make sure to take everything she says with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
......Because if not, ...then I might really end up believing that Satoshi-kun disappeared because of the curse.<br />
<br />
Her stories about the dark side of the Hinamizawa village were filled with interesting topics.<br />
<br />
Among these talks, which she probably treats as nothing but her own guesses and theories, some of them actually contained truths that I know to be true because I am a member of the Sonozaki family. I was stunned by the sharpness of her analyses.<br />
<br />
She considered Oyashirosama's Curse as an extension of an ancient religious ritual.<br />
In other words, an act by religious fanatics of Oyashirosama.<br />
<br />
According to her unique theory, there is a faction in Hinamizawa with religion as it's central focus, with the Gosanke built up around it.<br />
<br />
And that they are working behind the scenes to bring back the prestige that the sennins(*) of Onigafuchi village had before they were allegedly lost after the end of Meiji era.<br />
<br />
The scale of Miyo-san's theory is extensive, and if you look at it as a whole, it makes good sense too.<br />
<br />
However, if we look at a specific point, such as the reason for Satoshi-kun's disappearance, it doesn't provide any explanation at all.<br />
It was nothing but an unrefined theory.<br />
<br />
Notebook Page 172 (Ep. 18)<br />
<br />
The place I have been calling the Underground Torture Chamber, seems to be officially called the Underground Ritual Tool Shrine. Meaning, Ritual Tool Shrine is synonymous with Torture Chamber.<br />
<br />
According to Takano-sans theory, even after the Meiji period, the Watanagashi and other blood stench rituals have secretively been continued by the Gosanke<br />
<br />
And if agreed, they have the preparations to perform these rites at anytime.<br />
<br />
As long as these Ritual Tools are signified by words like blessed (enshrined) through their torturous use; one cannot deny the foundations of Hinamizawa is based on this culture of brutal killings.<br />
<br />
Takano-sans theory is correct.<br />
<br />
And unlike the symbolic Ritual Tool Shrine, the Sonozaki Estates Underground Ritual Tool Shrine is indeed maintained in condition for regular use.<br />
<br />
Even here, Takano-sans theory is correct.<br />
<br />
I do not know about the Kimiyoshis storehouse but, since the Sonozaki and Furude families enshrined these Ritual Tools, they must have a treasured structure of a similar scale.<br />
<br />
Yes, even in the present, the Gosanke ceaselessly continues this horrendous ceremony.<br />
<br />
In this cursed village, even today the village as a whole is preparing for this truth carried out by this mysterious body.<br />
<br />
Notebook Page 173 (Ep. 18)<br />
<br />
The sacredness of the Ritual Tool Shrine, even within the worshippers of Oyashiro-sama is unsurpassed.<br />
<br />
Of course even I, as a person with ties with Hinamizawa, know this.<br />
<br />
But, in reality more that I ever thought, how upheld its inviolability is exceedingly irregular.<br />
<br />
According to Takano-sans research, the history to sacredness of the Ritual Tool Shrine is terribly old. Just the use of these Ritual Tools alone regards this peculiar festival, the Watanagashi, as a holy testimony.<br />
<br />
But, the Watanagashi in Takano-sans research isnt just a genuine religious ceremony; it is a public execution to assure the supremacy of the Gosanke.<br />
<br />
If so, then calling this a holy rite is a mistake to begin with.<br />
Under these conditions, their existence should have been subject to hatred and horror.<br />
<br />
The constant exposure to terror is nothing more than dominance through fear. But, when done with utmost secrecy it eventually bestows into sanctity.<br />
<br />
They say when a mere person touches these tools, they become impure.<br />
Which means nothing more than if the tools were publicly displayed they will loose their praise, so withhold them in feign importance, to increase their glory.<br />
<br />
In other words the truth behind the sacredness of the Ritual Tool Shrine is... fear. It is the true identity of the emotion which rules this village...<br />
<br />
Noteboook Page 195 (Ep. 20)<br />
<br />
Furude Rika.<br />
<br />
She is the head of the Furude Family but, regardless of having a seat in these important meetings, most of the time, she does not attend. Even if she attends, she is unlikely to say much, so in matter of fact; it is a post that is left empty.<br />
<br />
In the Furude Family if the first born is a girl for eight generations straight then that child is said to be Oyashiro-samas reincarnation according to folklore, and according to Takano-sans research, it is highly likely that she is the one.<br />
<br />
Definitely as a religious symbol the fascination around her is unusually high, and more one blindly follows this Oyashiro-sama cult the more holy she becomes.<br />
<br />
For that religious symbol; for this idol-like existence; for Furude Rika to be an assassin was unbelievably shocking.<br />
<br />
Impossible.<br />
Its too abnormal.<br />
<br />
This assassin-play is what underlings do, not something a VIP like Furude Rika will do.<br />
<br />
The most natural assumption would be that she wasnt Furude Rika at all, but a different yet identical entity.<br />
<br />
The way that assassin moved, gave me the feeling she was extremely used to fighting.<br />
<br />
I was only able to turn the tables because I had a stun gun.<br />
If I didnt have a stun gun, I dont know what would have happen at that scuffle in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Yes. That assassin was much more superior than she looked.<br />
<br />
Did Furude Rika receive training as an assassin??<br />
Or was it a body double that came as an assassin??<br />
<br />
Together with that peculiar syringe, she is shrouded in mystery. Unidentifiable. Incomprehensible. Her existence itself is unexplainable. ...as if she was a demon of some sorts.<br />
<br />
Was Sonozaki Oryou aware of its existence...?<br />
<br />
In this village named Hinamizawa something is hidden.<br />
<br />
What I believed to be the depths of Hinamizawas darkness,<br />
........was much deeper than I ever imagined.<br />
<br />
Noteboook Page 196 (Ep. 21)<br />
<br />
Up to this point, I thought that my revenge would be accomplished by bringing down the so-called curse system.<br />
<br />
This of course means to kill off the top heads of the system; the three leaders of the gosanke, the acting head of Sonozaki Shion and the &quot;executioner&quot; that follows around Keiichi.<br />
<br />
However, Keiichi has not become a target of any attacks even though he is openly undefended. This is despite the fact that I told everyone in the meeting that he was one of the members that went into the warehouse.<br />
<br />
In fact, it seems that I am the one who seems to be getting targeted; with Furude Rika coming to attack me so brazenly.<br />
<br />
If this curse system is what I theorized it to be, then it would make sense that Keiichi would become the bait as the guy who intruded into the sacred warehouse.<br />
<br />
Yet, no one seems to be interested in that bait. Rather, since I caused some trouble with Furude Rika, it seems I was targeted for an attack. With this, a theory is formulated where &quot;going up against the Furude family is a higher sin than intruding the sacred warehouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Furude Rika proclaimed that intruding the warehouse was not such a big deal. She seemed to forgive Keiichi. But when I challenged that notion openly with Rika that day, I was attacked by &quot;Furude Rika&quot; herself.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that the power balance is different? Are there two different wings to this? Does this say that there is a &quot;curse system&quot; whose objective is to bring down the curse upon the intruders of the warehouse such as Takano-san and Tomitake-san, while another &quot;curse system&quot; exists at the bequest of the Furude Family teachings?<br />
<br />
But there is a contradictory flaw to this idea.<br />
<br />
It is plainly visible that Tomitake-san's death was caused by the contents inside the Furude family's syringe. Rika showed the effects of it herself by dying in a manner very similar to &quot;scratching one's own throat.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, Tomitake-san was not a target under the Furude family curse system.<br />
<br />
And I still have no idea why Keiichi has not been targeted yet. Is there some kind of reason where he is acquitted in contrast to Takano-san? Is this similar to how Houjou Satoko was the only one acquitted from the curse that befell on the Houjou family?<br />
<br />
Yes, Keiichi is a great friend to Furude Rika. ...Then does that mean that people that have a great social relationship with Furude Rika are protected from the curse? Is Furude Rika herself in a much higher priority list than the so-called &quot;curse systems?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, that can't be.<br />
<br />
The top of the ladder is that Onibaba. Rika could not have been on a higher status than her.<br />
<br />
scratch scratch scratch<br />
<br />
Are there numerous definitions that define the targets of the curse? There might be several different defined situations where each one of the have different executions of bringing down curses.<br />
<br />
Ah ****, this **** is getting complicated. None of my theories are coming together anymore. If my theories are ****** up, the targets for my own revenge would've been useless.<br />
<br />
By now, I can't even understand who should I act my revenge upon and how Satoshi had to have disappeared.<br />
<br />
How deep did the Onibaba knew about the dark side of Hinamizawa? That first strike was a big mistake. I had so much to ask towards that bitch. ...****, I didn't imagine that she would die so quickly in shock... That's was a costly mistake.<br />
<br />
I am certain that I have failed somewhere in this revenge.<br />
<br />
...Hinamizawa's dark side...is just too deep to imagine.<br />

Ryuuguu Reina (EP 22 &amp; 23)<br />
<br />
This is not part of the TIPs sections, but summarizes Rena's past as it wasn't fully covered in Episodes 22 &amp; 23<br />
<br />
    * Reina<br />
      Rena's real name is Ryuuguu Reina (&#31452;&#23470;&#31036;&#22856;). She was born in Hinamizawa and spent her early childhood there.<br />
<br />
    * Parents' Job<br />
      Both of her parents are fashion designers. Her mother got a break and was offered a lead position at a large company in the city and thus they move. Her mother became very successful, but her father didn't have the talent her mother had. He was unable to get a job in the city and became a house dad.<br />
<br />
    * Akihito<br />
      As the days pasted, Reina's mother's success grew. She often came home late and almost never spent time with the family. She would, however, take Reina out once in a while and buy anything for her. On one such outing the mother brings a man name Akihito with her introducing him as her colleague. A few months later, the mother takes Reina out to an expensive cafe. Reina's childhood dream was to eat as much ice cream as she can and the mother wanted to fulfill that dream. While in her dreamland, the mother asks Reina whether who she likes better: Mommy or Daddy. Reina promptly answers Mommy as she thought it would be rude otherwise because of the treat she was getting. The mother then reveals that she plans to divorce her husband and remarry Akihito. Reina is, of course, crushed and asks why can't Daddy remain as family. The mother responds that she is pregnant with Akihito's baby. Later, the mother's lawyer talked to the father concerning the divorce. Reina is not sure if her father was warned beforehand, but she suspects her mother of never telling him. In fact, her mother refuses to talk or to meet with him and has her lawyer answer all calls. Her father kneels in agony on the floor upon hearing the news. Reina walks up to comfort him but the father asks her, Did you know about Akihito? Yes and the father slaps Reina. Reina then comes to the realization how nave she was and hugs her father and cries with him.<br />
<br />
    * Enlightenment (translated a portion of Reina's monologue)<br />
      As a girl, I thought I should show kindness to everyone. But that is wrong. There are people you should show kindness to and then there are your enemies. Just because people come to you with generosity, it doesnt mean you should return that generosity. You have to determine who are your enemies. Who are these enemies? They are the ones that exist who will come to destroy your life, the bad guys. Its not whether they had bad intentions or not. Much like a weed that grows in a flower garden: a dandelion may not have any sins, but it sucks the nutrients that the tulips need, so you have to pull them out. Even if the dandelion had no sins they are enemies. The bad guys.<br />
<br />
      Thats right. That man was a bad guy.<br />
      I should have never accepted him.<br />
      I should have completely devoted myself to reject him.<br />
<br />
      If I have done so, it might have distance him from my mother.<br />
      If I have done so, my mother wouldnt have the thoughts it would work out with him.<br />
      If only, ......I put the effort to, my parents relationship wouldnt have been broken.<br />
<br />
      I cried with my father but, the tears we both shed had different meanings.<br />
      To my father, his tears were no doubt for the sudden irrational situation he was thrown in.<br />
      But, me. They were tears of regret that I had the opportunity to make the choices to avoid today.<br />
<br />
      As my father rubs my cheeks, he opened his mouth to apologize but he was unable to do so as we cried together.<br />
<br />
      Later, the lawyer brought me to my mother. My mother asked to live with her.<br />
      I didnt know how to answer her as I looked down listening to my mother apologize.<br />
<br />
      My father knew that I will meet with my mother this day. That is why he gave me this letter.<br />
<br />
    * The Letter<br />
      Reina felt the weight of the tear-dried envelope and was determined to hear her mothers answer. At the lawyers office, Reina hands her mother the letter and asks her to read it. The mother takes the letter and sets it aside saying she would read it later. &#12358;&#12381;&#12384;&#65281; (Lies!) Her mother had no intention to read the letter.<br />
<br />
      Akihito is my enemy. He deceived me with kindness, the same kindness he seduced my mother, who used to be a loving mother No, she is my enemy as well. Shes trying to break my family. Shes trying to take me away from my father, my family. She willfully allowed herself to be seduced. She is one of the bad guys.<br />
<br />
      Reina screams at her mother. Never show yourself in front of me again, and dont ever affectionately call me Reina again. Those were her last words towards her mother.<br />
<br />
    * Hinamizawa<br />
      After returning home, Reina gathered all her mothers belongings and started to destroy them. She cant remember much what happened afterwards. The pills the doctor gave to her makes her feel dizzy every time she tries to remember. She wanted to destroy all the things that had her mothers scent, but she wanted to destroy herself even more. Or maybe she just wanted to throw dirt on her mothers fame by destroying herself. That is when Oyashiro-sama came. Oyashiro-sama said to come home to Hinamizawa. Reina thinks to herself Yes, this is all a Curse. Because the Ryuuguu family abandoned Hinamizawa, this divine punishment came down upon us. Everything went wrong because we left Hinamizawa. I have to return to Hinamizawa. I should have never left. <br />
<br />
      So they return to Hinamizawa back to their late grandmothers house where they used to live.<br />
<br />
    * Rena<br />
      Reina decided she wanted to start a new life in Hinamizawa. She couldnt stand the name Reina anymore It brought too many bad memories (iyana koto &#12356;&#12420;&#12394;&#12371;&#12392;). So she took out the i from her name.<br />
<br />
    * Rina<br />
      Even after returning to Hinamizawa, the father was still struck in deep depression. He had a lot of reprisal money from the divorce and never went to seek a job. He meets the show girl Rina who brought back his smile. Rena couldnt say much about their relationship, because no matter how much she tried, she couldnt bring back the same smile Rina did on to his face. As the weeks pass, Rena started noticing toiletry and other personal items that where not her or her fathers around the house.<br />
<br />
    * Happiness<br />
      Rena didnt want to be a bother in her house. She felt she shouldnt be there when Rina was around. So she looked around for something to pass the time with. That became her Treasure Hunt. She finds an old car and makes her secrete place there. For some reason the electricity is still alive at the Dam Construction office so she connects several extension cords to power the lamp she finds and keeps in her car. Here she can find her escape. Here Rena can remind herself that she is happy, to not to think that shes unfortunate. Satoko-chan and Rika-chan had it worse. They both lost their parents. She still has family. By staying perspective she can protect herself from the bad guys because it was she who allow the misery to fall on her. By saying the magic word Hau~ she can be happy again. Shes already taken out all the bad memories with her i. She can become happy again. With all the bad memories (iyna koto &#12356;&#12420;&#12394;&#12371;&#12392;) gone, all that remains are the good things ah then she realizes the good things also being with i (ii koto &#12356;&#12356;&#12371;&#12392;)<br />

Them (Ep. 25)<br />
<br />
After ending the call with Oishi and stepping outside the phone booth, at that moment.<br />
.........Chills ran down my spine, as I finally came to realize this.<br />
<br />
In this darkness, I was standing in a phone booth that stood out tremendously.<br />
<br />
Theres no way that nobody didnt see me.<br />
<br />
No, not that nobody didnt see me, I was seen.<br />
<br />
From the darkness, they steadily stared at me with their glowing eyes...<br />
.........there was no way they were human.<br />
An illusion? No. I already know their identity.<br />
......They are in the true sense, the ones who control the Gosanke who rule Hinamizawa.<br />
<br />
The level of their eyes are low, ......the vague outline I see were feeble.<br />
......true, it is clear from past records that they are physically frail.<br />
<br />
That silhouette which indicated their nonhuman form, was unbelievable unrealistic.<br />
...especially the silhouette of their head was unusual, as there was something protruding, it clearly was not human.<br />
<br />
......Their outward appearance, were detailed in one of the scrapbooks I received from Miyo-san.<br />
<br />
......Their eyeballs were pure red like blood, ...their bodies smelled of ammonia, ......and in the past, throughout the world they were captured on several occasions, yet......all melted and disappeared, leaving no trace behind.<br />
<br />
......what did remained, was the certainty of their descent.........<br />
<br />
At that moment, that impossible unrealistic silhouette took as step closer..., gently making a real sound.<br />
<br />
That sound was brutally realistic, and pulled me back to reality.<br />
<br />
d, ......dont come closer, you monster!!<br />
<br />
rustle, crack, grattle rattle rattle!!<br />
<br />
The gravel on the road, erupt, flying every where, and making a bizarre sound.<br />
<br />
Moreover, it gradually chased after me.<br />
......driven by my fear I once again use the same words out of my mouth.<br />
<br />
And then this time, the glass door to the phone booth I was just in, started to rattle and shake, BANG!<br />
<br />
BANG!<br />
<br />
and as if being struck, these monstrous sounds began.<br />
<br />
I gave a scream which sounded like tearing silk, and darted.<br />
<br />
And after running to the point my lungs felt like exploding, I turn around..... I notice that the jarring presence was no longer there.<br />
<br />
............Was I mistaken.........?<br />
<br />
There was no way I was mistaken, I definitely heard that sound which kicked up the gravel, that monstrous sound that rattled the phone booth!!<br />
<br />
But calm down Ryuuguu Rena...!<br />
......even if you were mistaken, right now settle down your heart.<br />
<br />
......either way, ...eventually you will have to fight them.<br />
...The next time they appear, strike back at them... Squash that head with your massive hatchet...! I will protect Hinamizawa, this is my duty. ...I will not allow them to do what they want... !!<br />
<br />
scratch scratch scratch scratch... ... scratch scratch scratch scratch.<br />

Rena's Hideout (Ep. 25)<br />
<br />
This is not part of the TIP section of the game. This is what happened the night the cops went searching for Rena after her disappearance.<br />
<br />
TL note: The red text is how it is displayed in the game. This is all from Rena's point of view.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if I turned on the light in this hideout, the light will be reasonably obstructed by the mounds of decommissioned vehicles to seep through. ......Logically, I understood this, but taking precaution upon precaution, I did not turn on the light.<br />
<br />
In the salience of this hideout, to not turn on a single light as I hold my breath has considerably filled me with fear.<br />
<br />
Probably, if I did something, it would have distracted me a bit.<br />
......but right now, the circuitry in my head has numbed, and I have not the strength to think about from hereafter.<br />
<br />
Despite that, I did not have the courage to lie on my side to restore my vigor.<br />
......Occasionally, when I thought I heard a suspicious sound, Ill straighten up, strain my nights eye and kill my breath. There was a continuous repetition of that.<br />
<br />
Oishi believed in my Sonozaki Conspiracy.<br />
......but, until he has some evidence of the conspiracy, he cannot take any large actions.<br />
<br />
And that proof he needs, is most likely something that confirms there is a facility that is researching these parasites but, ......I have no clue to where that facility would be.<br />
<br />
I would imagine the Irie Medical Clinic would seem as the most likely place, but I have no proof. I doubt even they will research in a place where I would think of.<br />
<br />
Perhaps........., theyre re-using a bomb shelter from the war or something similar where they can place this research laboratory underground.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, ......within the premises of the Furude Shrine, there is a secret building that is not open to the public. I believe it was called the Saiguden.<br />
<br />
According to Miyo-sans research, the Furude Shrine is the central location to the Oyashiro-sama faith.<br />
<br />
And, for one of their ceremonies that unusual festival, the Watanagashi, the Saiguden is considered to be extremely sacred, as they keep the festivity equipment there, it seems.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the Watanagashi was a medical ritual done to create an immunity vaccine from these powerful parasites.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the Festive tools for the Watanagashi, were medical tools then.<br />
<br />
If that is so, the Saiguden is such a sacred place, because it is an important medical facility. .........this is suspicious.<br />
<br />
Could it be that inside the Saiguden, there is the secret laboratory?<br />
......ah, ****. It isnt the Irie Medical Clinic. If theyre going to do it, its here. Why didnt I think of this when I was on the phone with Oishi?!<br />
<br />
Itll be good if Oishi realizes this......<br />
Should I go to the phone booth again, and tell Oishi about the Saiguden?<br />
<br />
As soon as I thought that, I heard a car engine come closer, and further concealed myself.<br />
<br />
There is no way a vehicle will pass by here this late at night.<br />
A terrible premonition warped around my head several times over, causing me to tense up...<br />
<br />
Before long, from the direction of the remnants of the Dam construction office buildings, I saw a light, perhaps from the cars headlights.<br />
<br />
Did the car pass by, heading toward the construction office buildings?<br />
......but, nothing is there besides the empty prefabs.<br />
<br />
This is not a place where someone will visit at this hour, absolutely not.<br />
<br />
As I fix my eyes in the darkness, the car engine stops and the light disappears, in exchange two flickering beams from flashlights wiggle about.<br />
<br />
It seems those lights went inside the prefabs.<br />
<br />
......No doubt they were searching to see if I am hiding within them.<br />
<br />
Until they went away, I continuously held my breath and watched.<br />
<br />
With only the fickle lights which I see from here, I can not tell who they were.<br />
<br />
Most likely......they are Sonozaki Henchmen.<br />
They must have learned that I left the house, and have been searching the entire village...<br />
<br />
...Why at the time like this, does my face itch, my legs become restless, making me feel extremely irritable? Probably staying standstill in this sweaty humidity is causing the inside of my elbow and the nape of neck to itch irresistibly.<br />
<br />
When I scratch at them, an unbelievable loud scraping sound was made, surprising me, and I stopped.<br />
<br />
......Normally, when scratching at bug-bites, never does it make such cruel sound!<br />
<br />
I guess this is proof that my nerves are becoming sensitive.<br />
...Even when Im this far away, I am holding my breath in the darkness.<br />
Regardless if I scratched, or even squeezed, they will not know I am here.<br />
......Even so, I will not allow even the smallest sound, and I, for the time being, endured the itchy sensation all over my body,<br />
......but ultimately, my body recoiled and scrape scrape, I couldnt help furiously scratching my entire body.<br />
<br />
When from here on out, for me who would need to continuously live this life in concealment, to be this nervous on my very first night; it is not likely I will last.<br />
<br />
I would need to become a bit bolder, to not be moved over something as small as this.<br />
As I think this, I force myself to relax, and without restraint, allowed myself to scratch at the nape of my neck freely, which lifted this discomfort from the sweat that stuck onto me.<br />
<br />
Then I notice my hunger.<br />
<br />
Now, my stomach started to growl.<br />
...but, this is no doubt proof I feel this hunger because I have relaxed.<br />
<br />
But if I do eat, it will get rowdy...<br />
I decided to endure this until the men searching the offices leave.<br />
<br />
Hurry up and leave, hurry up and leave.<br />
If you guys leave, I can eat.<br />
<br />
......Possibly my continual wishing held some success, as it seems those two lights stop searching the around prefabs.<br />
<br />
......but I guess I wished too strongly.<br />
<br />
Those lights were now continually fixed in this direction.<br />
<br />
...Could it be that they realized Im here?!<br />
No. Theyre walking towards this direction!<br />
<br />
I hurried and ducked, and listen carefully through the blanket covering me.<br />
<br />
.........Eventually, .........I feel the twos sturdy footstep approach closer.<br />
<br />
Since these footsteps were approaching closer without hesitation, I feared that Ive already been found.<br />
<br />
But, there is no way I was found...<br />
If they knew about this place from the start, they would have not wasted their time searching the prefabs, and if they have found me, then these footsteps wouldnt be walking as leisurely like this.<br />
<br />
......It is just a mere coincidence they are coming this way...<br />
<br />
Since I covered myself with a blanket, I had no idea who they were.<br />
I had no idea where they were flashing their lights, and I could not carelessly stick my head out the window to take a peek. Until their presence disappears, I had no choice but to curl up and become like a rock.<br />
<br />
As they arrive nearby my hideout, they stopped in their tracks.<br />
...I heard the two talk.<br />
<br />
&#12300;............She aint here.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;I guess we should circle around. Look around there.&#12301;<br />
<br />
As their footsteps split away from each other, I recognized that the two were patrolling around the trash mound.<br />
<br />
......This hideout is nothing more than a remodeled inners of an abandon car.<br />
Just by taking a glance at it, and it will look like nothing more.<br />
...But, if they peer inside, it will be apparent that this isnt just a regular abandon car. If they find out, Ill be a trapped rat...<br />
<br />
From their conversation, it is apparent that they are looking for me.<br />
......Then, ...are they the Sonozaki Special Assault Squadron?!<br />
If they find me, .......there is no doubt they will instantly kill me here!<br />
<br />
And I already experienced and comprehend how well suited this place is for killing.<br />
<br />
Moreover, I killed two people here.<br />
If I could do so, then this should be childs play for professional amongst professionals like them!<br />
<br />
But, while saying that, right now, I cannot do anything.<br />
Utterly, all I can do, was pray they will leave here.<br />
<br />
At that moment, I heard a slight BEEP ...a refined electrical sound.<br />
<br />
&#12300;This is Atsushi, all is well here. .......................yes. The Granariiiies?! Yes, roger that.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;What happened?&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;It seems Ryuuguu Rena is at the Granaries. There was an eyewitness account.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;Hey hey... theres just no hope. What are we going to do?&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;Either way, the boss ordered us to get her at all costs. Even if she fled to Sapporo or even Fukuoka, we have no choice but to chase after her.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;Impossible, theres no way well find her. ......Even so, we still gotta?&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;......The boss wants Takano Miyos Scrapbook which is in Ryuuguu Renas possession. For him to make such a fuss over this, it must be something big.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;And, what are we suppose to do?&#12301;<br />
&#12300;Well leave a surveillance in front of the Ryuuguu house, and pull out from the rest. Lets go back and grab some tea.&#12301;<br />
<br />
Then the twos footsteps went away until I could no longer hear them, .........and the sound of the cars engine rang. Finally, I came out of the blanket and looked outside.<br />
<br />
The cars light made a U-turn, and I saw them leave.<br />
Then eventually, even the engines sound melted away into the silence of the night.<br />
<br />
I spat all the hot air that Ive stored and stored within myself, and scratch at all the bug-bites around my body which Ive been resisting, wiped off the sweat that stuck on me, the let out the coughs Ive held back.<br />
<br />
From their conversation, I most definitely heard it. There was no doubt that both of them were Sonozaki Henchmen.<br />
<br />
......It completely coincided with the information Oishi told me.<br />
And then they bluntly mouthed that important piece of information.<br />
<br />
They declared they were after the &#12300;Scrapbook&#12301;.<br />
<br />
Until today, I only assumed the reason I was being targeted was because I received Miyo-sans Scrapbook, it is not because I heard it from someone.<br />
........I might have had the wrong assumption, and forced myself to think this way.<br />
<br />
But, it blatantly came out of their mouths!<br />
We gotta get Ryuuguu Rena. They blatantly said from their mouths, reason is because she has Takano Miyos Scrapbook!<br />
<br />
And then, they also said they will leave surveillance in front of the Ryuuguu House.<br />
<br />
......Well, thats only natural.<br />
If I was on the chasing end, I would most definitely guard there as well.<br />
Its better that I dont make the mistake of going home.<br />
<br />
............But, ...the matter of fact, they said something more important than any of this.<br />
<br />
Yes, thats............, the fact that &#12300;Ryuuguu Rena is at the Granaries.&#12301;<br />
<br />
Under normal circumstances, I could have laughed this off by saying they probably saw someone who just looked like me.<br />
.........But, the reality is, the situation is no longer like that.<br />
<br />
When Miyo-san is already dead, she was &#12300;there&#12301;.<br />
And when I am here, I was &#12300;there&#12301; at the Granaries.<br />
<br />
.........Within the contents written in Miyo-sans Scrapbook, ......this was the most unbelievable part.<br />
They......, separately from the Sonozaki Family underground actions, .........were steadily coming after me...<br />
<br />
......Already everything and anything has gone beyond my understanding of common sense.<br />
...Should I fight or should I run, unable to decided, do I stand petrified waiting to be devoured...?<br />
<br />
...............No way, No way...<br />
Theres no way Ill stand here petrified waiting to be killed and devoured.<br />
If I cant win then I want to run.<br />
If I cant run then I want to fight.<br />
.........I will become happy, I will! I will not sit here, and have it end...!<br />
<br />
But, ...............Miyo-sans Scrapbooks &#12300;foretold&#12301; enemy, were approaching closer to me, ready to take their bite.<br />
If I happen to disappear at this trash mounds without anyone knowing,<br />
the me at the granaries will appear, and as if nothing has happen, will take my place sneaking into my life. ......No one will ever see through this.<br />
Not even my father, my friends, no one will realize this, as it takes my place......<br />
<br />
Wait, perhaps that only I havent just realized this......, and the people around me have already begun to be replaced......?<br />
<br />
Yes. .........Even bio-terror that the Sonozaki Family intends to put together, is nothing more than a plan being played in the palm of their hands.<br />
<br />
Just like the rats possessed by their members will no longer afraid of cats.<br />
As result, the rats will no longer run even within the sight of a cat.<br />
......Thats why when the cats eat the rats, they can transfer into the cats body.<br />
......The rats were only being used by their purpose, and to further this purpose, theres no way the rats will become afraid of cats.<br />
<br />
Thats why the Sonozaki Family are the same.<br />
......They may believe they are moving at their free will, ...but in reality, without knowing their purpose, they are unwittingly helping them.<br />
<br />
That is how from ancient times, they &#12300;parasite&#12301;. We are, after all, nothing more than a pack of rats.<br />
<br />
Almost all of us rats are too stupid and too foolish to recognize their existence, ultimately having this misunderstanding that we live on our free will, and further their cause.<br />
.......However, occasionally, a perceptive mouse will be born.<br />
<br />
That perceptive mouse will learn that we are only being used, and at times unveil their existence.<br />
......Of course, even if she unveiled this, no one will believe her so there was no problem.<br />
Before long, the mouse who unveiled the truth will think she was mistaken, then will be swallowed and erased.<br />
<br />
Despite this, even more rarely, ......a mouse will appear who not only realize this, but can objectivity prove this.<br />
<br />
That is exactly who Miyo-san was.<br />
<br />
To them, ......this rare mouse was an extremely dangerous being.<br />
...That is why, when this mouse appeared, they become unbelievably forceful and daring, to remove this threat.<br />
<br />
To tell you the truth..., we all know their forceful and bold methods.<br />
......But, the stupid mice wont believe this and will ridicule this.<br />
......Not knowing they are being led not to believe, they ultimately help them, inadvertently.<br />
<br />
.........They erased Miyo-san.<br />
<br />
And then, ......switched places with her.<br />
<br />
But, they made a mistake with the body of the real Miyo-san being found. Thats why they failed at replacing her.<br />
<br />
...............Then, ......will the erase me, and take my place too?<br />
<br />
Or possibly, to get close to me, .........they switched places with one of my friends?<br />
<br />
......Even when their outside appearance are the same, ......whats inside will be completely different, something beyond our comprehension... an irregular being.<br />
<br />
No, .............it will appear. It already has appeared.<br />
<br />
The day after Miyo-sans death, it appeared.<br />
And then tonight, I appeared at the granaries.<br />
......they will still continue to appear.<br />
They have already given up their guise to chase after me.<br />
<br />
Many more, many more, ......will appear...<br />
<br />
Then at that moment, from the slopes of the scraps, I heard the sounds of someone coming down.<br />
<br />
I crouch down my body once again, and suspiciously observed the direction of the sound.<br />
.............There is only one flashlight. ...There only seems to be one person.<br />
<br />
.........Who? ......At this hour...?<br />
<br />
Its shadow was very small, ......definitely impossible to be an adult.<br />
<br />
Shivers ran down my body...!<br />
<br />
The flashlight looked over here, and the footsteps approached straight forward, drawing closer.<br />
.........Unlike the guys before, these footsteps fully understood that I was hiding here.<br />
<br />
...No, .......This has to be a coincidence.<br />
...Let me hide one more time. I definitely can get pass this.<br />
I was able to last time. ...Hide, Hide!!<br />
<br />
I covered myself with the blanket, and huddled pretending to be a rock...<br />
But, with unbelievable certainty, the footsteps drew closer.........<br />
<br />
And then, .........on this hideout vehicle , ......kong<br />
<br />
kong<br />
<br />
......as if something was knocking.<br />
<br />
My eyes became wide open; my entire body couldnt restrain from the overflowing drops of cold sweat.<br />
......Unwilling to accept the meaning behind the knocking, my mind went blank fighting with the fear.<br />
<br />
But, the knock echoed once again.<br />
<br />
.........I felt a light through the blanket.<br />
...Am I, ......completely exposed by the beam of this flashlight...?!<br />
<br />
Even so, I still was biting off the fear.<br />
......as long as I dont move, it wont lay a finger on me... selfishly wishing, trying to withhold my trembling even to the slightest degree.<br />
<br />
&#12300;...............giggle giggle giggle giggle.&#12301;<br />
<br />
That was a blatant laugh.<br />
......It was a voice ridiculing me, who still continued to curl thinking that I havent been found yet.<br />
<br />
However, ...still I endured it. ......because, because, ...if I come out from here...!!<br />
<br />
&#12300;......What are you afraid of? ......giggle giggle giggle giggle.&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;u, .......uWAAAAAaAaAAaA!!!&#12301;<br />
<br />
I threw off the blanket, and faced the person behind the voice.<br />
<br />
.........Who was, ......Rika-chan.<br />
<br />
...This surly, ......was an impossible encounter at an impossible place.<br />
At this late at night... for Rika-chan to appear here alone at such a place, ......was impossible!<br />
<br />
...I instantly understood.<br />
<br />
This Rika-chan, ......certainly looks like Rika-chan but, .........however much it completely imitated Rika-chans outward appearance, .........I understood that it was an entirely different entity.<br />
<br />
Miyo-san, me, ......and now, even Rika-chan... I see...<br />
<br />
But before I was crushed by fear, slightly mustering a bit of courage, I daringly opened my mouth.<br />
<br />
&#12300;...............Rika-chan......Im guessing...?&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;......Mi~ ...Who else could I appear to be?&#12301;<br />
Rika-chan responded the way the Rika-chan I knew well did.<br />
<br />
......but, this is impossible.<br />
To visit at this time, at this place, was absolutely impossible...!!<br />
<br />
&#12300;..........I know ............Youre not Rika-chan, are you?&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;........................&#12301;<br />
&#12300;......Unfortunately, you will not deceive my eyes. Even if you look like Rika-chan, ...you are not Rika-chan. You are not my friend, Furude Rika. ......Who are you...?!&#12301;<br />
&#12300;........................&#12301;<br />
<br />
Rika, for the time being, stood there blankly.<br />
...It was as if she couldnt comprehend what I said.<br />
<br />
But, ......that silence, was long.<br />
<br />
If she really didnt understand, enough time has passed for her to break this awkward silence, ......yet she remained mute.<br />
<br />
Then, ............finally, ...she threw off her sheeps skin.<br />
<br />
&#12300;......giggle, ......giggle giggle giggle giggle giggle.&#12301;<br />
<br />
It laughed.<br />
.........To notice that it wasnt Rika from its absolute disguise of her outward appearance, it laughed at that amusingly.<br />
<br />
&#12300;...............Who, .........are you!!&#12301;<br />
Without responding to my question, ......it, for the moment, continued to laugh on by itself.<br />
And then, ......looking at me, ......with these eyes Rika-chan will never show, peered at me and said.<br />
<br />
&#12300;I have lived a long time in this world but .........this is the first that someone has noticed that I am not Rika. Ive always thought you were a perceptive one ever since we first met, but......... well done. giggle giggle giggle...&#12301;<br />
&#12300;...............!!!&#12301;<br />
<br />
......It blatantly put to words what my heart feared the most..., I believed it was certain that I was shocked.<br />
<br />
What was said was frightful; There was no way to misinterpreted what was said, ...as if any doubt need to be left written out, ...it deliberately mouthed these words.<br />
<br />
&#12300;But I will dare to call myself Rika. .........I, do believe that my given name is Rika, as its been so long.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;......huh......... ...by long, .........how long.........?&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;Nothing spectacular. Only about 100 years or so.&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;.........ha, .........huh?! What are you saying!!!&#12301;<br />
I felt the contradiction.<br />
Knowing that the one before my eyes is not Rika, I was refuting the existence of that very being.<br />
......As long as this sentiment continues to embedded in the human mind, ...people never acknowledge what they dont understand forever.<br />
<br />
...That is why, &#12300;they&#12301; are never acknowledged by humanity.<br />
<br />
&#12300;You do not need to be afraid. You are inside the car. I am outside. ......Respectively, neither one of us can do anything rash to the other. I believe that this is a convenient distance for us both, no? However hundreds of years I may have lived, Furude Rika is merely just a small child. I do not believe I can overwhelm you by force. .........Rather, I am the one uneasy that you might frenzy and jump at me.&#12301;<br />
<br />
......To me, this being that looked like Rika was nothing more than eerie, however, when I realized that it only came to converse, my mental stability settled a little.<br />
<br />
But, .........at this late night, at this impossible place, ...what did it want to talk about?<br />
I am sure, I was a cooked goose. ......therefore, now I had no choice but to bravely stand this ground.<br />
<br />
After waiting to see how I will react, ...it opened its mouth.<br />
<br />
&#12300;............You are afraid of something. .........Am I correct?&#12301;<br />
What a sarcastic way of putting it.<br />
......With Rika-chans adorable face, I could not believe it can smirk in such a twisted fashion.<br />
Thats why, I crushed all the emerging feelings of fear in my heart, and firmly responded.<br />
<br />
&#12300;.........Yes. Why, thank you.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;I see. ..............What are you afraid of?&#12301;<br />
&#12300;......You......know that well enough!!&#12301;<br />
&#12300;...............giggle giggle.&#12301;<br />
<br />
It said, we were mutually protected from each other, divided by the car but.<br />
It was evident that I was obviously cornered.<br />
......While I stayed in here talking to it, its henchmen could be encircling me. ...As I realize this, I listened more carefully to my surroundings...<br />
<br />
&#12300;Dont be afraid. I came here to save you. ...giggle giggle giggle.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;Save...? ha, huh......How would you do that...?&#12301;<br />
&#12300;You are, ...just a little sick. With a small bit of medicine youll feel better. .........Would you be interested if I said I brought that medicine?&#12301;<br />
&#12300;...med, .......medicine.........?&#12301;<br />
<br />
That thing, who looked identical to Rika, ...fumbled around its pockets, and took out a small case.<br />
<br />
Clicking the case open, I peered to see what was inside.<br />
......When I saw what was inside, I, couldnt help screaming.<br />
<br />
&#12300;......a syr.........syringe...............?!&#12301;<br />
<br />
No person would be walking around with a syringe. Already everything and anything has become absurd.<br />
......but, in Rika-chans hand there was a syringe. There was no other way to look at this...!<br />
<br />
&#12300;Yes. This shot will make you feel better.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;Feel better, you say?! HA!! I know. Its that, isnt it?! The drug that killed Tomitake-san!! The parasites that have that primal power!! The terrible shot that will renew Maggot Breakout Syndrome!!&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;The shot that Tomitake had, huh? But this is different. Okay?&#12301;<br />
It giggled.<br />
<br />
That laughter wasnt what was scary.<br />
......What was scary is that it frankly acknowledged the truth behind Tomitake-sans death!!<br />
And, it frankly acknowledged the direct &#12300;cause&#12301;to why Tomitake-san was led to Maggot Breakout Syndrome!!<br />
<br />
&#12300;.........You also plan for me to die that way, dont you! And then, ......the Rena that appeared at the Granaries will switch places with me settling everything... ...Thats your ulterior motive, isnt it?! Who will take that shot!!&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;..................well, I thought you will refuse. Its definitely suspicious.&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;You know, dont you...... ...Then what are you going to do?! ...Are you going to attack me in a group and forcefully give me the shot, like you did with Tomitake-san?!&#12301;<br />
<br />
The result of Tomitake-sans autopsy was before he met his critical end, it was apparent that he was fending off several opponents according to the bruise marks on him.<br />
...Meaning, there was no mistake that the shot was forced on him unwillingly.<br />
<br />
&#12300;......I would like to assault you and give you the shot, ...but Ive never done it successfully. Thats why Ive given up doing so forcefully. ......So, I will leave it up to your free will. &#12301;<br />
&#12300;You got to be kidding!! Who will take such a creepy shot!!&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;.........I also was troubled by that. How I can humor you to take this shot. Its impossible to give it to you forcefully, and youll wont understand either. ... Ultimately then, I have no other choice but to leave the decision to you.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;Theres no way I will listen to that!! Who will fall for such an obvious trick!!&#12301;<br />
&#12300;..................well, you reacted the way I anticipated. Not that I expected anything.&#12301;<br />
<br />
It gave out a long sigh, making a belittling gesture as it proceeded with a bitter smile.<br />
......As if saying... I gave you this chance to be save, cant comprehend that you low life...!<br />
<br />
I wanted to retort back giving in to the taunt, yelling out Ill take that shot, but that is exactly what my adversary would want me to do.<br />
<br />
&#12300;Hurry up and go home to your friends, and tell them you failed to give me the shot!! I will not lose! I will thoroughly resist to the end!! And then......I will take hold of that less than 1% chance of victory, and make sure that I will destroy you all!!&#12301;<br />
&#12300;............I see. ..............Then give it your best shot. Its a doomed world anyway. ...giggle giggle giggle giggle.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;......doomed......?&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;It has nothing to do with you. It does no good for the frog inside the well to hold any interest to what is outside the well, right? giggle giggle giggle.&#12301;<br />
<br />
Coming along this far, what deep words it hurled...<br />
I tried desperately to comprehend what this terrifying entity who mimicked Rikas appearance was running its mouth with.<br />
<br />
&#12300;...Wha, ...What do you plan to do with me!!&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;I will do nothing. Do as you wish.&#12301;<br />
&#12300;.........eh?&#12301;<br />
<br />
...That response took me a bit off guard.<br />
<br />
...As far as I know, the words do as you wish, have the meaning of liberation or indifference, even if used by a person of evil intent, these were not words of malicious meaning.<br />
<br />
Or......, could this be taken in an entirely different way...?<br />
Reading deeply into words two and threefolds, it said these words once more.<br />
<br />
&#12300;Live as you wish. ......I have no more interest with this Ryuuguu Rena. I will hope that things will go better with the next Ryuuguu Rena.<br />
<br />
......at the very least, I will pray the next Ryuuguu Rena will not be as particularly perceptive. ...giggle giggle giggle giggle.&#12301;<br />
<br />
That was... as terrifying as a judge sentencing a death penalty.<br />
<br />
&#12300;Before, I also ran about trying to fix every slight disparity as it occurred. ......but after a while, I became tired of it. .........I have no more interest in this Hinamizawa. Ill go look for the next Hinamizawa. ...but, you only have this Hinamizawa. Thats why, you should do your best to live. &#12301;<br />
<br />
I understood that one after another horrifying words were being said.<br />
<br />
It was a blunt forecast of doom, ......a revelation that a terrible end is closing in on reality...<br />
<br />
Already another one of me has been prepared.<br />
And then......When I disappear being swallowed by this maelstrom of Fate that I can not contest, ...it, unsympathetically, was prepared to have everything replaced.<br />
<br />
What people feared the most, is losing their meaning to their life.<br />
.........When someone says even if youre gone there will be someone to replace you, there is no moment where worthlessness of ones life is felt more.<br />
That is no different to an indirect death sentence!<br />
<br />
The thing that looked like Rika, clamped the syringe case shut, and placed the case in its pocket.<br />
<br />
Then it turned its heels, and started climbing up the slope of the scrap mound.<br />
Then, twirled around for one last time, ......with a devilish smile, ...said with an unbelievably cold expression.<br />
<br />
&#12300;Well then. ......Good bye, this Ryuuguu Rena. ......With the next Ryuuguu Rena, lets be friends, ok?<br />
<br />
......for the most part we normally will. .........gigglg giggle giggle giggle! &#12301;<br />
&#12300;Th, .........There will not be a nextRyuuguu Rena!! I am who I am, I am the only one!! I will not let this go your way! Never, NEVER!!&#12301;<br />
<br />
Did my shouts that were more like screams reach her?<br />
<br />
......The way her eyes looked at me were very cold. ......It was as if, I was nothing more then a reflection of a past image on a CRT screen.<br />
<br />
&#12300;Having conversations like this, occasionally, is quite amusing, huh. giggle giggle giggle......, Ha ha ha ha... Ha ha ha ha ha, ...Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha......... &#12301;<br />
<br />
That laughter eventually faded into the darkness of the night.<br />
.........The being which had Rikas appearance, but was not Rika, also disappeared swallowed by the darkness.<br />
<br />
All that remained was, ......I, alone.<br />
<br />
Cast off, indifferent to whenever I disappear,<br />
Abandoned, telling me to futilely resist all I wish, I am here.<br />
<br />
A spare has already been prepared, and because I was too perceptive, I am of no use in &#12300;their&#12301; Hinamizawa.<br />
<br />
.........Then I noticed that, ......these trash mounds, ...was unquestionably a gravestone prepared especially for me.<br />
<br />
I returned to my senses, and came to the realization that this place, nor this hideout, was serving their purpose.<br />
<br />
Its better that I gather my belongings and hurry off to a different place.<br />
They told me to resist all I wish. ...I will do that, damn it damn it...!!<br />
<br />
I need to prepare for my move.<br />
Stuffing all my belongings in my knapsack, I need to hurry and leave this place.<br />
Since the flashlights beam is too small, I turn on my night stand.<br />
<br />
The world of light and darkness distinctively emerged with the newly created shadows.<br />
Then when I went to reeled in my knapsack, ...I was startled.<br />
<br />
The palm of my hands, ......were drenched in this icky pure red liquid.<br />
In the darkness, I thought I was just wiping off sticky icky sweat.<br />
......but, that......wasnt sweat at all......<br />
<br />
Then this blood is......what?<br />
<br />
I suddenly came to realization.<br />
Just until now, I was scratching and scratching at the bug-bites on my neck, ...and before I knew it, I was pouring out with blood.<br />
The moment I realized that, the affected parts that I peeled off became mixed in with the feeling of pain, and there I was suddenly groaning.<br />
...From the wounds on my neck, I felt the unpleasant feeling of something creeping and squirming, and I once again scratched at my neck trying to dig out that something.<br />
<br />
And again my hands were drenched with the thick coat of fresh pure red blood.<br />
......There was no mirror in here so I cannot see but, ......I remembered, I already knew the meaning of squirming.<br />
<br />
They steadily spread throughout my entire body, then the inside of my elbows and the back of my knees began to itch terribly.<br />
<br />
......If a person was to experience this for the first time, they would think they were bitten by a bad bug.<br />
<br />
...but fortunately, ...I already knew this itching.<br />
<br />
&#12300;............why, ............how...............!&#12301;<br />
<br />
I detestably mumbled. ......how, right now, here......!<br />
<br />
Theres no mistake, ......this is the &#12300;Maggot Outbreak Syndrome &#12301;.<br />
<br />
Almost certainly, if I open the blood vessel in my arm with a razor, from inside the vessel, those dirty and disgusting, red-black squirmy things will gush out.<br />
<br />
How can that be, I never was injected by that suspicious shot...?!<br />
But, there never was a rule that this had to come from a shot.<br />
...Could it be......that I havent noticed I was poisoned...!?<br />
I doubt it was mixed in the food I ate at my house, but when I was at school, my friends and I were close enough to share lunches ......Maybe it was mixed in at that time...!<br />
<br />
That Rika-copy which just came by, ......shined her flashlight on me.<br />
So, she must have known that I tore the skin on my neck and was bloodstained.<br />
...regardless, it didnt panic, ......and said that I didnt have much longer anyways.<br />
<br />
......ah, ......It, ......knew that I didnt have much longer so........it was smirking and laughing so repulsively...!!<br />
<br />
Its very itchy, but dont scratch it. The more I scratch, the itching will increase, ...and in the end I will repeat the same mistake as Tomitake-san! ****, **** ****...!!<br />
<br />
Last Night (Ep. 25)(Good)<br />
<br />
&quot;...............Soon ......tomorrow is going to be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? ...............Ahh, you mean our death date?&quot;<br />
&quot;............It ended up the same way this time too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know about that. .........It's very similiar, but there are some things that were different too. ......Keiichi, remembered what happened before too.&quot;<br />
&quot;......That's impossible. There's no way he could remember, no, there's no way he could know them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*giggle*.... The more you say it's absolutely impossible, ...the more it makes one think that this is really a miracle, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all over now anyway.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is it really over, I wonder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will soon end. Everything, will end. ......That's right, when the cicadas cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
....Is it all going to end anyway?<br />
<br />
The more times you throw a die, the closer the total will get to the average.<br />
When you throw a die 100 times, during the process, even if you get a miracle of 6s coming up continuously, it's still all average when you total everything up in the end.<br />
<br />
...It's just something enclosed by a preestablished arrangement.<br />
<br />
But, if you throw a die 100 times, the minimum and maximum number still ranges from 100 ~ 600.<br />
Even though the more throws you make, the more likely the future will try to converge at one average value, the truth is, the more throws you make, the more possibilities for the future there will be.<br />
<br />
If you throw the die 100 times, you'll get about 500 different futures.<br />
Throw 1000 times, and you'll have 5000 different futures.<br />
Won't there also be one ending among them where I would actually finish from this neverending dice game?<br />
<br />
......The miracle that Keiichi showed me, it was something that opened my eyes and taught me that it's definitely not a waste of effort to continue throwing the dices.<br />
<br />
Don't give in to something like an average value.<br />
<br />
&quot;...........................&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;............That view of your back sure is irritating. .....I can feel a ton of sorrow from it saying &quot;it's no good again anyway&quot;, you know.&quot;<br />
&quot;...........................&quot;<br />
&quot;......It's not just you, .......I'm also thinking that it's not going to work out this time anyway.... ...But you know, I won't give up until I have thrown the last die. Keiichi taught me that. Something's different this time. ......That's why I'll try to believe in that.&quot;<br />
&quot;...............Rika is, .............really a strong person.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah well, I'm way younger than you anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />

The Demon's Script (Ep. 26)<br />
<br />
Summer 2005<br />
<br />
The tires of the car began to rattle as the road turned from asphalt to gravel. The incessant cries of the cicadas seeps through the shut windows.<br />
<br />
Most people would open their car windows and let the billowing natural air in along with the sounds of the cicadas. However, people also have become spoiled. They would rather keep themselves cool with the air conditioning turned to max rather than hearing the cicadas.<br />
<br />
Usually rains would begin to pour during this time of the year. But, June came along right into summer without any rain this year. ...I remember that the weather twenty years ago was also similar in which that June jumped right into summer as well.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;The air around this area is still clear as I remember it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Indeed it is. The winds and the sunshine here is nice. Perhaps if it had a chance, this place would've become a UNESCO World Heritage Site like the village in Gifu. What a waste...&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But thanks to that there are no irritating tourists around here. See, it makes it a much more smoother ride. ...Why do tourists forget about pedestrian traffic laws when they are in rural areas? Move over to the side, sheesh, I tell ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Ahahahaha. Akasaka-senpai, do you still do outdoor activities?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Not as much as I used to. There's not much free time in this job for that.&quot;<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Ahahahahaha. Same here. ....Oh hey, there he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The person I was supposed to meet with recognized me and waved his hand before I honked my horn. It was a young fellow on a motorcycle with a backpack on his shoulders. You can tell that he was prepared for a campout with his gears. Akasaka and his partner stepped outside of the car and shook hands with the young man.<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;It's nice to see you again, sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Yo. How's everything going on your end! Here, at ease. This is Akasaka-senpai. He took care of me back in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hello, my name is Akasaka. A man names Oishi was also supposed to come along today, but he had to undergo an emergency check-up and wasn't able to come. Anyhow, it's a pleasure to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;It's an honor sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;So, Akasaka-senpai, where shall we go first?&quot;<br />
<br />
His name is Akasaka Mamoru. He is a veteran police detective from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. By this time, he was already at a career level where he can see his retirement just a bit over the horizon. But, his sharp instincts and eyes have not retracted a single bit. His well-built muscular body and fearless aura against violent crimes can be well seen from the spectacular police duties he has built through experience.<br />
<br />
His connection to Hinamizawa goes back to almost thirty years. In 1978, he was in the Public Safety Division in the Metro Police Department. He first came to Hinamizawa back then while undergoing an investigation for the kidnapping of former Minister of Construction Inukai's grandson.<br />
<br />
There, he met Oishi and....Furude Rika. Furude Rika predicted the fate of her own death. ...Akasaka regrets to this day that he was unable to save such a little girl from her death. He learned of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster on TV and met up with Oishi soon thereafter. They pledged to uncover the mystery of the the cruel fate that fell upon the little girl and the serial murders of Hinamizawa. Unfortunately, Hinamizawa was off-limits to the people for a long time. As a result, the past twenty years for Akasaka and Oishi were painstaking. Their sole reliance were based on publishing what little information they've accumilated so far and the occasional tips and clues from former residents of that area. ...But the lockdown on Hinamizawa was finally lifted. However, they were unable to come to Hinamizawa immediately due to Akasaka's busy work schedule and Oishi's degrading health. In fact, Oishi was also supposed to come today as well, but he was called in for an emergency health check-up at his local hospital. Hence, Akasaka was the only one to come here today.<br />
<br />
The other two were Akasaka's juniors from his university. One was an officer in the Ground SDF and the other was his subordinate. The latter was involved during the lockdown phase of Hinamizawa and was quite knowledgeable of the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
Akasaka takes out a scrapbook from his bag. The sides were all dented and one can tell that this book was very old. Akasaka flipped through the pages, thought for a second, and told them their first stop.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Alright, please take me to the Onigafuchi Marsh first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;No problem. Right this way sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man propped up his bike and waited for the two to get back to their car. After honking their horns to signal that they were ready, they headed their way to the Onigafuchi Marsh...<br />
<br />
When the forest opened up, they came upon a very absurd area where the ground was sealed in heavy concrete. This was supposed to be where the marsh was, but there was not even a single drop of water in sight. All the water was replaced with concrete. ...This was how the current Onigafuchi Marsh looked like in the present day.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hahahaha. Not even a single drop of water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;I was told that they've sealed the marsh in the early stages right after the Great Disaster. This place was already covered in concrete by the time I arrived here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Let's go down there and take a closer look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka got off of his car and walked to the center of the concrete-filled marsh. This was not a parking lot nor a heliport. ...It was just a huge empty concrete space right in the middle of the forest.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;...So this is the place conspiracy theorist say that it is a landing spot for UFOs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;Really? I've never heard of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, that's what is written on occultish websites. They claim that this is the place where our government conduct meetings with aliens. But with such an empty concrete space like this in the middle of nowhere, I can't blame them for such rumors to be flying around.&quot;<br />
Young man &amp; Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahahaha.&quot;<br />
<br />
This marsh was the place where the volcanic gas erupted from back in June of 1983. The deadly mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide engulfed the entire town in the middle of the night and annihilated the residents of Hinamizawa in one night. The town was put into lockdown and the SDF in charge of this area sealed the marsh with concrete.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But the conspiracy theorists have some of their points which can't be dismissed as well. Any geologist would tell you that sealing off the site with concrete is absolutely useless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Young man: &quot;Hmm...that's true. I've never heard of anyone trying to prevent a volcano from erupting by pouring concrete into it's volcanic crater. On the other hand, our country is known for doing weird construction jobs with tax payers' money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lately, websites dealing with the supernatural and UFOs has had a significant increase in the topics of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster. It is well known by now that the cause of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was due to deadly volcanic gases emerging from a magma chamber. In 1983, a similar natural disaster occurred in Lake Nyos, Cameroon. This showed that such a rare natural disaster can indeed occur anywhere on Earth.<br />
<br />
Recently however, rumors began to fly around here and there over the internet about another possible explanation. They say that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was just a government cover story and that the real cause was due to a biochemical terrorist attack by aliens. Why did such a rumor began to spread now...? Conspiracy theorists claim to back up their explanations from a secret document known as File No. 34. The name File No. 34 was given by someone posting on the internet message board, but the name stuck since the naming of the file sounded like a government conspiracy.<br />
<br />
It is not known how they obtained these documents. They posted scans and pictures of the documents, but what was written on it were ridiculous at best. Some added their own notes claiming it to be the real thing, so it is doubtful if such a document really does exist or not. But the contents of this File No. 34 is worth noting. However, since this stuff was posted on the internet, it should be taken for a grain of salt as most of the stuff is more like an urban legend.<br />
<br />
The File No. 34 was a notebook written by a nurse named Takano Miyo who worked at a local clinic in Hinamizawa. No. 34 was most likely named after her name. They say that this woman was also a researcher who sought to explain the local demon myths of the area. The contents of this notebook states that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster of 1983 was prophesized in advance.<br />
<br />
According to her research, she claims that an UFO crashed landed in Hinamizawa a long time ago and sunk into the Onigafuchi Marsh. The UFO had parasitic bacteria from space which began to infect the residents of the area. The infected villagers showed signs of extremely violent behaviors fit for the word &quot;demon.&quot; Takano Miyo insisted that this was the explanation to the myth about demons spurring out of the marsh. A lone alien who survived the crash realized that the earthlings were becoming erratic because of their intergalactic bacteria, and decided to show themselves to the villagers to help them out. ...This is the explanation of the appearance of the Oyashiro-sama. The alien was able to cure the villagers with highly advanced technology but was unable to eradicate it thoroughly. Since the villagers looked up to the alien as some sort of diety, the alien utilized its status to hand down specific rules to the villagers in order to contain the disease. The bacteria took a liking to Hinamizawa's habitat, so if the carrier of the disease left Hinamizawa, the symptoms came out again. Hence, the rule of not to leave the village was made. These all then lead to the hermit legends of the Onigafuchi Village. The weird practices and miracles that they performed were all due to the advanced technology that they received from the alien.<br />
<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahahaha. Those conspiracy theorists do indeed have a colorful perspective on things don't they? Remember that prophecy thing by Nostradamus? They all said that the world was gonna end in 1999, but nothing happened past July. All those TV shows built up the drama but it was just business as usual after that. Irresponsible I tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;But, Takano Miyo did indeed seemed to have foreseen the Great Hinamizawa Disaster in advance. Look at this page on this scrapbook.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You must be joking. Ahahahaha.... ........Akasaka-senpai, is this for real...?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As time passed, the parasitic nature of the bacteria stabilized and became nothing more than a commensalistic symbiont in the human body. Aliens and the bacteria began to wither away from people's minds...However, it is claimed that the alien lived on for hundreds of years with the protection of the gosanke. It lives to this date underneath the secret lairs of the Furude Shrine. The alien was able to manipulate the bacteria living inside of the villagers body and was able to maintain control in the village all this time. The alien wanted to reclaim the power it once had and began to research how to bring re-awaken the long lost powers of the bacteria...etc. etc...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, things get much weirder from here. Cutting to the chase, the real reason for the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was that it was that the alien's was researching how to spread the re-awakened bacteria in a global scale in order to conquer Earth. The Japanese government had this secret government agency which dealt with such extraterrestrial matters, and they received special training from Area 51 in the United States....etc. etc... And this government agency moved in to stop this alien from it's plan to take over the world by locking down this village and killing off the residents of this area through the use of biological weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Wahahahaha! Hey, wasn't there a Hollywood movie that was similar to this? It was the one with the black guy as the lead character...what was the title...M.I. something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yeah I know. Reading this thing to gives me a headache. However, the write of this bunch of bull, Takano Miyo, was mysteriously murdered in June 1983. Right before her death, she gave these scrapbooks to one girl as if she knew that she was going to be killed very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That girl's name is &quot;Girl A.&quot; ....However, some fanatical mystery buffs proclaimed that they were able to track and narrow it down to a girl named &quot;Ryuguu Reina.&quot; Hence, it became known as the &quot;Ryuguu Reina Theory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryuguu Reina inherited Takano Miyo's intentions through her death. She tried to fight against the planned invasion by holding the school hostage and demanding the local police to uncover the alien's plot. Of course, no one believed her and it was assumed that she was in a state of paranoia. Back then, it was assumed that Ryuguu Reina was misdirected into believing Takano Miyo's mystery rants and unfortunately fell into a state of paranoia which lead to her aggressive action.<br />
<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;When she held the school hostage, Ryuguu Reina told the local police that the alien controlling the gosanke was plotting a massive bioterrorism in the near future. And the very next day, the Great Hinamizawa Disaster occurred.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You've gotta be kidding! Couldn't it be just some kind of coincidence?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;I don't know. According to conspiracy theorists, the immediate lockdown of the area by the SDF itself have inconsistencies here and there. Sealing off this marsh with concrete is just one example. And according to some of the SDF members who were involved in the lockdown at the time, they proclaim that they witnessed several people conducting some kind of secret research unrelated to geology. Of course, those who dismisses such accounts brushes these accounts as some sort of precautionary measures to keep unauthorized people off limits of the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;I'll have to agree with the people who dismisses these accounts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;And people also look at why it took such a long time for this lockdown to be finally be set open once again. In contrast, the lockdown of the Miyakejima Islands of Tokyo for their volcanic gases lasted only 4~5 years. The natural disaster that happened in Hinamizawa was one that was exceptionally rare, yet the lockdown lasted for over twenty years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;In Miyakejima Island, the residents strongly lobbied the government for their return to their home island. However, in the case of Hinamizawa, there were no residents alive who wished to return in the first place. Perhaps the government waited until they were absolutely certain that it was safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Hmm. How about this one? The SDF members that were involved in the lockdown of Hinamizawa had there blood samples taken in the subsequent months. Some of these members were discharged without any explanation once some kind of result came in from those samples. Some of them believe that they were using the members of the SDF as a human test subjects to see if they would get infected or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;I think they were just checking up on the members' health since it was an area where the gas disaster occurred. Besides, normal corporate warriors also have their own annual physical check-ups too, and they take blood samples there as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yeah, I understand your statements too. But then, here's another interesting theory. There are some who proclaim that there was no deadly gas emitted during the so-called Great Hinamizawa Disaster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;No emission of volcanic gases? How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Basically, as stated, there was no volcanic gas. The gas disaster itself is a some sort of government coverup. It's like that movie made by Steven Spielberg. You know, the one where the humans make contact with UFOs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Now that's what I call a typical example of conspiracy theorists' way of explaining things. So, what kind of basis do they have to say that there was no emission of volcanic gas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, a bunch of conspiracy theorists and mystery buffs came to Hinamizawa as soon as the lockdown was lifted. According to them, the hydrogen sulfide in the volcanic gases should've caused some corrosion in metallic objects and have should've caused major damage to the surrounding wildlife. However, they found no such signs of such disruption, which they proclaim that there was no volcanic gas to begin with. ...But since this village was abandoned twenty years ago, I doubt that they would've found anything to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Hahaha. Well, there's the internet for you. Don't believe everything that's on it! ....Akasaka-senpai, please don't tell me you are buying into these things....are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;At first I had my doubts as well. But lately, I'm beginning to think that there might be some truths to some of these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;You, believing in UFOs? Oh come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, what if this scrapbook is indeed the real File No. 34?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;This scrapbook was the one that was in Ryuguu Reina's posession at the time of the school hostage incident of June 25, 1983. It was assumed to be lost during the confusion of the Great Hinamizawa Disaster. However, Oishi's old friend was able to locate it in the evidence storage at the prefectural police headquarters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back then, even Oishi thought of the idea of aliens to be preposterious. ...But after reading this again after the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, some of these seem to hold vital clues.<br />
<br />
The alien part, we can probably disregard these as ********. But her theory of parasitic microbes causing the symptoms seen in Hinamizawa's past, also known as &quot;the Oyashiro-sama's Curse&quot; is a bit intriguing. Of course, there is no proof that such microbes exist, so this still remains at the theoretical level.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;According to Oishi, he says that the gosanke were trying to bring back the old traditions to Hinamizawa. They were researching how to bring back an old but deadly microbe in order to uphold their power. And perhaps that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was an experiment that went wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course there are also information from the internet cannot be dismissed as just a theory or a myth. For example, the mysterious death of the village clinic's head doctor. And the mystery of Furude Rika's gruesomely mutilated corpse...<br />
<br />
There was an underground research lab beneath the village clinic where Dr. Irie was forced to do microolgical research, but he gave into his own misdeeds and committed suicide. ...Furude Rika is thought to have been brutally murdered as a sacrifice for some sort of ritual ceremony.<br />
<br />
However, their experiment went wrong. ...Instead of the microbes becoming the parasites of the villagers, they became killer viruses. And so that is how the village virtually became extinct in one night...<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;For one thing, at least we know that this was just not a gas disaster. We cannot disregard the fact that right before the disaster, one girl did say that a bio-terrorism would occur. There's also the fact that Ms. Takano Miyo made the scrapbook as well. If the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was an unprecedented and unforeseen natural disaster, then the existence of these two are quite extraordinary. And upon reading this File No. 34 there are things written here that shouldn;t be just shoved off to the side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;So...the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was not a rare natural occurrence, but was in fact a bio-terrorist act by some cultists?&quot;<br />
<br />
In the Heisei era, everyone in Japan knew about the shocking news where a doomsday cult group had researched making sarin nerve gas and unleashed its deadly domestic terrorist acts. But in the Showa era, the idea of a single cult group being able to carry out such a terrorist act would've been scoffed at, moreso it would've never crossed the minds of anyone to start with.<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Some also say that the long lockdown by the SDF is actually a long research effort to uncover that killer virus...but I have my own doubts here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Hahahaha. Well, at least this story sounds more credible compared to aliens and UFOs. The idea of cultists and domestic terrorism is sounds more rational in our day and age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Or perhaps maybe there really was an UFO. ...When Ryuguu Reina was taking the school hostage, one of her demands to the police was to have them pull out the wreckage of the UFO from the Onigafuchi Marsh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Whatever...&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Well, you can say 'whatever,' but look. We're standing on the marsh itself right now, and there is no way for us to check if there is any since it is all enclosed in concrete several meters thick. This is all due to a construction effort in which numerous geologist say that it is a futile attempt to contain volcanic gas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Well then, the only way to prove Akasaka-senpai's theory is to find a single survivor of Hinamizawa and try to uncover if that person has that microbe in him or her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Sadly, that is more difficult than ever. After the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, there was a massive witch-hunt scare of people from Hinamizawa (see: burakumin). People from this area are quite mum and do not wish to disclose where they came from.<br />
<br />
Right after the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, there were numerous reports of people who were from the Hinamizawa area that began to show erratic behavior. When these people began to show eccentricities and began to commit suicide in strange ways, there was a massive scare within Japan for people from Hinamizawa and began outcasted former residents of that area in a sort of social witch-hunt. The government was practically useless in protecting privacy at the time, so the former residents of Hinamizawa began to hide their background to prevent their own backlash. (see the manga Onisarashi-hen)<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Then it's a dead end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;Yet as a cop, it is my duty to never give up. ...There's just too much evidence that points that the Great Hinamizawa Disaster was not just a natural disaster. If I can just grab a hold of one vital evidence, just one, I think I can start reeling in the truth behind all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka's friend: &quot;Yeah, but it has been over twenty years ago. The truth might be laying somewhere very deep within the darkness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akasaka: &quot;That's true. ...Even as I now stand here in the 21st century, but I don't think I'm going to find any answers here.&quot;<br />
<br />
What happened in Hinamizawa, June of 1983?<br />
<br />
The only factual evidence that I have is that Ms. Takano Miyo mysteriously died and she left behind a scrapbook proclaiming that a bio-terrorist attach would occur. A young girl took a school hostage shortly thereafter proclaiming the &quot;prophecy,&quot; but no one took it seriously. The head village doctor committed suicide. The little girl whom the villagers revered as a reincarnation of the Oyashiro-sama, Furude Rika, was found gruesomely mutilated.<br />
<br />
What is the truth behind this scrapbook? Do the contents of this scrapbook really list the attempt to unravel a huge conspiracy? Or is this just some ramblings of an eccentric mystery buff as it was brushed off back then?<br />
<br />
If this scrapbook is true, this all would've been averted by just listening to the heeds of one girl. If this is all false, then who created this disaster like a pre-meditated scenario?<br />
<br />
After that infamous sarin nerve gas incident, the terminology known as &quot;mind control&quot; which was used by the cultists came into the spotlight. In contrast to &quot;brainwashing&quot; which is a short-term effect which forces a person to commit certain acts, &quot;mind control&quot; is a long-term form which is induced upon the victim over a course of time. Over time, the victim begins to believe that what he or she must do is right and acts upon it as his or her own act. It is a form of character altercation which is far more serious than brainwashing.<br />
<br />
The cultists induced fear and anxiety to its members through revelations of doomsday. At the same time, they are also given ways and means to salvation, which began to penetrate within them into obedience on their own recourse.<br />
<br />
This above said formula is quite similar to how Ryuguu Reina became a puppet of the File No. 34. Then would that mean that Ryuguu Reina was a victim by someone who &quot;mind controlled&quot; her? And did some cultists who tried to manipulate her with mind control also try to instigate doomsday on their own to authenticate their own cause? Would that mean that this File No. 34 is some sort of religious text for such a cult?<br />
<br />
As I fall deeper in deciphering what is real and what is not...I reset my mind to figure out if there is anyone might be laughing in amusement at this disaster. If taken that into mind, then this scrapbook is a script. It's a stage script which plays out a tragedy in which several thousand villages loses their lives in one night. It's a demon's script where they observers laugh at the deaths of human lives.<br />
<br />
Who the hell wrote this script? And who the hell performed this? Someone was laughing while it played out.<br />
<br />
Damn it...!! ...What the hell happened in Hinamizawa, June of 1983!!!<br />

 Sitting in a Happy Circle with Oyashiro-sama (Minagoroshi-hen)<br />
After dinner, Satoko, Hanyuu, and I watched TV.<br />
Amongst the Variety Programs, there was a comedian exciting the crowd. We also laughed out loud.<br />
<br />
&#12300;Ho ho ho ho! He got exactly what he deserved&#12540;&#65281;&#65281;&#12301;<br />
<br />
&#12300;Au-au-au, but, that seems like it hurt a lot...&#12301;<br />
&#12300;Mi&#12540;&#12290;Nipa&#65374;&#9734;&#12301;<br />
<br />
From my eyes, after dinner the three of us were sitting together in this happy circle, but in reality, only the two of us, Satoko and I were there.<br />
<br />
The only one who can see Hanyuu is me.<br />
Satoko obviously could not.<br />
<br />
Every time Satoko says something, Hanyuu also responds in agreement.<br />
Of course Satoko can not hear those responses, but when Hanyuu is in a good mood, she responds often.<br />
<br />
The situation was like, a person on TV asking questions and replying to that, it was a quasi-communication that neither will ever have.<br />
<br />
In other words, it was like a make believe communication between the two.<br />
Besides myself, Hanyuu is unable to express herself to other people, so she eventually learned to play in this way.<br />
<br />
Thats why, every time Hanyuu is with our Club, along with everyone, she laughs and gets excited with us.<br />
<br />
If, Hanyuu could speak with us in a normal way, would she be accepted as good friend in our group?<br />
Thinking of that will most likely hurt Hanyuu, so I avoided doing so.<br />
<br />
But if all the miraculous tales passed down the Furude Family through old documents point to Hanyuu, then from ancient times, Hanyuu has to have shown her powers to quite a few number of people.<br />
<br />
However, now, her existence cannot be felt by anyone other than myself, let alone her supernatural powers even if setting aside the super.<br />
<br />
Why Hanyuu has lost that type of power, she will not talk about.<br />
<br />
I expect that modernization and the passage of time have lost of position of gods, thinning Hanyuus power and existence.<br />
<br />
Then there was the legend, where if within the Furude Family if girls were born 7 generations straight, Oyashiro-sama will revive.<br />
<br />
Without doubt with my generation has brought a person Hanyuu could finally converse with.<br />
<br />
From humanitys standpoint, would that be considered revival of Oyashiro-sama?<br />
<br />
This Oyashiro-sama existence that the Villagers worship, and this existence which Hanyuu advocates, at times do not match.<br />
<br />
From that posture she taking, laying flat on her stomach together with Satoko, resting her chin while enjoying the television, she cant be, nope, nope.<br />
<br />
 I and I (Minagoroshi-hen)<br />
When Furude Rika first learned of the existence of her family, she had no doubt that she was in a 4-person family.<br />
<br />
The family that she naturally sees. Her father, mother, and me.<br />
<br />
For the new-born Rika, the fact that I am an existence that can only be seen by her is probably something she never even dreamt of.<br />
<br />
My appearance is different than that of a human being.<br />
Even though my form is made to look human, the horns just couldn't be hidden.<br />
<br />
That's why, no matter how much I try to smile, it's clear that I'm not one of mankind.<br />
<br />
But if the new-born Rika sees me naturally, maybe she won't mind these ugly horns?<br />
<br />
That faint expecation came to fruit.<br />
<br />
Just like how a chick believes the first thing it sees to be it's parent, Rika believed that I was her family without any doubt.<br />
<br />
Even if I have horns on my head.<br />
<br />
That's why, from the day that Rika believed me to be her family, Rika and I became the closest buddies in the family.<br />
<br />
For Rika, I am a playmate that's closer to her than her parents, and for me, she is the first social partner I have had in a long time, longer than I can even remember.<br />
<br />
We always spent our time together, I think.<br />
<br />
However, her family, especially her mother, denied my existence strongly.<br />
<br />
Since my existence, which Rika saw as a natural member of her family, was denied so many times... Rika became distant from her mother.<br />
<br />
Things that children should be learning from their mothers through playing was not learned by Rika.<br />
<br />
That's why I thought that I should be her mother instead, and taught her many wisdoms and skills passed down from the past.<br />
<br />
............Ironically though, for some reason, that only caused her mother to become even more displeased.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, didn't she used to fight with her mother a lot about the way she refers to herself?<br />
The fact that Rika doesn't call herself &quot;watashi&quot; (feminine &quot;I&quot; in Japanese), but &quot;boku&quot; (boyish &quot;I&quot; in Japanese) is most likely my fault. (note: the speaker uses &quot;boku&quot; too)<br />
<br />
Other than having a poor relationship with her mother, Rika was a pretty normal young girl back then.<br />
<br />
Her personality was just like Satoko's.<br />
An energetic young girl who loved to run about the wild mountains and pulling pranks.<br />
<br />
...............But, in June of 1983,<br />
<br />
...Rika was robbed of her life.<br />
<br />
We're not asking for any more happiness than for Rika to fully enjoy and revel in her life as she grows up.<br />
...My power is only able to search for a path that leads there.<br />
<br />
It's true that the tragic fate couldn't be overturned no matter how many times we repeated it.<br />
<br />
...That's certainly a sad thing, but......... after falling to the bottom of a well that you cannot climb out of, it's not a bad thing either to look for the things that you can enjoy.<br />
<br />
It's true that Furude Rika's life is buried inside a deadend of fate, and can be described only as tragic.<br />
<br />
But... for me to be able to stay with Rika for longer than her original lifespan, I also felt a slight happiness there.<br />
<br />
Of course, Rika's not the only one I'm with.<br />
Although they won't respond to my calls... It's really enjoyable to be able to stay with Satoko, Mion, and Rena and Keiichi during their activities.<br />
<br />
Although I cannot join them, but... we were together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">10-09-06, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, damn.  In any case, here's a couple crackpot theories:<br />
<br />
The paranoia seems to always begin with Tomitake, Takano, and then Ooishi.  Could they actually be agents of whatever (or whoever) it is that makes people go insane?<br />
<br />
The swamp being the breeding grounds for a parasite the cultists wanted to use... really adds another layer to the whole Dam War thing :) Could they have been expiramenting with gasses in the swamp, and accidently caused the explosion?<br />
<br />
You might be close on the first part but we have to remember that this is a virus not parasites. What we saw as parasites where just what rena saw in her madness state.<br />
<br />
<br />
To back up this up a little<br />
<br />
Lunch Take-out List 1 (Ep. 24)<br />
 Attn: Kuroda Mental Clinic<br />
<br />
<br />
Going straight to the point, it is assumed that this is an acute case of post-traumatic stress disorder. The patient is subject to tremendous stress following her parents' sudden divorce and being subjected to choose to live with one or the other.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the patient firmly believes that she herself was responsible for her parents' divorce, which further promotes her state of self-mutilation. The patient's largest shock stems from sense of betrayal from her own household which she believed was an absolute safe haven. Henceforth, there is a high possibility that the patient will observe psychological defense measures to protect her family.<br />
<br />
(For example, she may feel high disdain for any person of the opposite sex approaching her father. She might feel uncomfortable in having other people in her home. Or, she may conduct absurd behavior in order to keep people away from her home. There have been reported cases where a patient would unconsciously bring and pile garbage for the latter example.)<br />
<br />
It is highly important that the patient hold daily household communication with her father. By deepening the communication between the patient and her father, it will strengthen their family bond and loosen up her anxiety.<br />
<br />
Since the patient only shows signs of acute syndrome in this case, there is a very good chance that she will immediately recover within three months with her father's support and proper medication.<br />
<br />
However, it is not uncommon for a patient who seemed to have recovered to have a sudden reoccurrence (flashback) even after ten years.<br />
<br />
The father is still young, and there is still a chance for him to re-marry. But, the prospect of her father re-marrying may cause the patient to have sudden flashbacks of her turmoil. This may instigate psychological defense behaviors along with elevated stimuli.<br />
<br />
Please explain this part very thoroughly with the father in order to maintain the recovery process and mental care of the patient. Should the father have decided to undergo a second marriage, it is recommended at the minimum that he should hold off in telling the patient until she has reached the capable age of living independently.<br />
<br />
Also, the patient's psychosomatic self-mutilation behavior, more commonly known as delusional parasitosis seems to have its own attributes to culture-bound syndrome.<br />
<br />
The patient seems to observe the superstitious curse from her home village, which she strongly believes that this was the cause of her parents' divorce. This is thought to be a part of her subconscious defense mechanism, where the mind tries to shove her self-proclaimed fault to her village curse in order to reduce her psychological pain.<br />
<br />
If such a strong belief can induce such symptoms such as self-mutilation, then there might be cases similar to these recorded previously. Perhaps prior medical files that document similar culture-bound syndromes may be available at a large medical institution near her local area. It will then be possible to provide better and accurate mental care for the patient by obtaining these case files.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*These B5-sized letters were written on the back of the paper used for writing memos.<br />
<br />
The blank side of these letters were written with the following memo:<br />
<br />
1 Chuuka-don (Chop Suey Bowl), 3 Shanghai-style Gomoku Yakisoba (Chow Mein), 1 large Cha-han (fried rice)<br />
<br />
Lunch Take-out List 2 (Ep. 24)<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it is important that we take caution concerning her father.<br />
<br />
Bearing in mind that she has taken a considerable mental blow by experiencing her fathers divorce, by trying too hard to be cordial to the patient, there is a strong possibility that she may erupt with induced delusional disorder.<br />
<br />
As the first step in mental care, one should listen to the patients story carefully, and not unsparingly deny them is the basics of the basics, but especially concerning with family, it may be difficult to not respond with some sympathy.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the symptoms of delusional parasitosis are widely known, and at times, it is not uncommon for that hysteria to spread entirely throughout a single community.<br />
<br />
(Thus, even with the complaints from several people, it does not necessary prove the existence of any parasite. Consequently, it is frequent that the outcries to the Health Care Centers for the extermination of these harmful pests are compromised with nothing but mass delusional statements.)<br />
<br />
Nevertheless with this case, the consistency to the details of these delusions are unusually extreme, in the worst case, by labeling this treatment for parasitic care, may result the patients to abnormally seek and mutually harm each other fatally, or possibly allow each other to race to suicidal tendencies with their pessimism views.<br />
<br />
Moreover, this induced delusional disorder, otherwise known as shared psychotic disorder*, shows a particularly strong possibility of influencing a convivial companion.<br />
<br />
People coming in contact with the patient, must make the patient understand that she is still presently under medical treatment, and take care to caution her to not be influenced by these delusions.<br />
<br />
Likewise, individuals who are likely to be influenced include family members and possibly a close person such as a boyfriend are to be noted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lunch Take-out List 3 (Ep. 24)<br />
<br />
The danger of culture-bound syndrome lies in the fact that it can easily trigger delusional misidentification syndromes.<br />
<br />
That is to say, in the current case, every time the patient sees something trivial, she will try to interpret it as being a &quot;curse&quot;.<br />
<br />
And it is believed that as a result of the accumulation of these events in an understandable form, a delusional system is created, ultimately leading to paranoia.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the patient is also exhibiting slight signs of personality disorder.<br />
Of course, it is at a very slight level, and has no hinderance whatsoever on the patient's normal life.<br />
<br />
It is not uncommon for even healthy individuals to have primary delusions in their daily lives.<br />
However, since the delusion contents are nonsensical, they are usually ignored by the individual automatically without recognition.<br />
<br />
And yet, there exist cases where these events would accumulate despite their incomprehensiveness.<br />
This is said to be largely dependent on the natural characteristics of the individual, and it is believed that the patient shows a relatively strong characteristic in this area.<br />
<br />
Now then, I believe that Dr. Kuroda is very much aware that primary delusions are categorized into 3 different kinds of cases.<br />
<br />
Delusional mood is the feeling of impending crisis without basis.<br />
Delusional intuition is the feeling of a sense of duty or goal without basis.<br />
Delusional perception is the feeling of a baseless cause against a baseless target.<br />
<br />
In the patient's case, it is believed that these incomprehensible delusions accumulate, acting out simultaneously with the culture-bound syndrome, inducing delusional misidentification syndromes, and ultimately causes incomprehensible delusions to become understandable by interpreting them as a &quot;curse&quot;.<br />
<br />
The comprehensible delusional system then induces understandable secondary delusions, further strengthening the patient's delusional system with the passage of time.<br />
<br />
(The delusional parasitosis mentioned earlier can be considered as a secondary delusion)<br />
<br />
A common point in all paranoia patients lies in the fact that even after an outbreak, they would still appear perfectly normal, with no changes in their personality.<br />
<br />
The patients would also be unaware of their own ailments, and due to their personal interpretations of the delusonal system, there are many cases where a patient would arm him or herself logically, making it extremely difficult for a 3rd party to point out that he or she is having a delusion.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, although it may depend on the tendency of the delusions, there are also cases where a persecutory delusion would turn into a persuit delusion or conspiracy delusion, causing the patient to create an imaginary enemy and take up anti-social behaviours.<br />
<br />
(For example, there are cases where believers of a religious cult would respond to the cult founder's paranoid visions as a group, shifiting the group into a conspiracy delusion, causing them to take up anti-social behaviours in the name of self-defense. Although no such cases have been reported in Japan yet, it may become possible in the near future)<br />
<br />
Luckily, as of now, the patient hasn't reached such a serious condition.<br />
With proper treatments, she should easily be able to make a full recovery.<br />
<br />
Please make sure that her father also understands that this is not an unusual case, but something caused by the accumulation of a number of innocent factors that anyone could have.<br />
<br />
The patient can be treated only by deepening her bond with her father, but as long as she has her bond with her father, she can definitely be treated.<br />
<br />
For the above reasons, if the patient is to return back to her hometown, I strongly suggest that the patient continue to receive guidance from specialized medical institutions even after returning.<br />
<br />
Please excuse me for writing such a long article.<br />
I wish to thank you for reading this until the very end.</div></div><hr />

Higurashi is not very expensive, you don't need to buy all eight individual chapters. All you need is the fourth and the eighth. <br />
<br />
The first four is Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, with the fourth being Himatsubushi-hen. The last four is Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, with the eighth being Matsuribayashi-hen.<br />
<br />
You can buy them for about $50 including shipping. This is for a game with over a hundred hours of reading material, assuming it all gets translated. But even if you just buy Matsuribayashi-hen, that's $30 for 30 hours of material.<br />
<br />
To make things easier on you, you can buy Matsuribayashi-hen at this link Himeya Shop (http://www.himeyashop.com/product_info.php/products_id/4952) and you can buy the first four, HImatsubushi-hen, at Himeya-shop too (http://www.himeyashop.com/product_info.php/cPath/62_87/products_id/2237)<br />
<br />
The translation project, which has released the prologue, is Here. (http://zettai.makenaidesuwayo.com/page/2/)<br />
<br />
I highly recommend the game. It's well worth the price of admission.<br />
