<h2>The Ring FAQ - Revision 2000.09.21</h2>

<p class="bold">1. Who/What is the Ring?</p>
<p>We are an unofficial, ultra-secretive, inter-server, <B>rogue only</B> association.</p>
<p>We are NOT an official EQ guild. Our members do NOT have guild tags and we are not registered/sanctioned in any way by Everquest, Verant, 989 Studios, or Sony. We operate "under the table" so to speak and that's just the way we like it. Our membership is to remain anonymous but we will have some type of "in-game" identification so members can recognize Ring brothers and sisters if they know what to look for.</p>

<p class="bold">1.1. What is the purpose/goal?</p>
<p>Our main purpose is to provide an in-game rogue-only community that provides a far-reaching, self-sufficient support network for our members, by our members. In other words, our primary goal is to HELP each other have successful rogue careers!</p>
<p>The Ring is dynamic and is a little different on each server. Some servers are more organized by their Wardens (see Warden explanation below) and offer more services, some servers offer less.</p>
<p>Some suggested offerings:<br>
- Financial backing (loans, newbie characters, underwriting major item purchases, etc.) - Each server addresses this option uniquely. However, there are to be NO DUES FEES collected. Common pools of money/items can be developed but it is based purely on member donations. Server "mule" characters could be used for extra storage.<br>
- Player resources - For undertaking quests, retrieving sought items, hunting trips, dungeon crawls, etc. Essentially just being there to provide another able body when someone needs a companion or two to group with, or just someone to provide a shoulder to weep on.<br>
- Training - We hang out with newbies once in a while to help them get started, show them around, etc. It is suggested that Wardens devote a portion of their time helping a newbie (i.e. training, answers, advice).<br>
- Area Guides - Wardens and Agents could provide "tours" of area to educate fellow Ring members. Each race tends to know its newbie areas quite well so spread that knowledge to members and make their newbie levels a little easier.<br>
- Equipment loaning - Higher level members may have some surplus equipment stored and not being used. It is possible that a younger Ring member may benefit from using it. This option is entirely up to the individual. A suggested method is for Wardens to create a newbie "starter kit" of low-level armor, weapon, and a bag. This "starter kit" should be passed on to a future newbies.<br>
- Regulated Marketplace - for selling goods among members. Fair prices (even a good deal or two…maybe)! Perhaps some type of money laundering or fencing racket where members can "unload" unwanted goods for a decent price (better than NPC vendor.) Then the fence could, in turn, sell to non-member players. Good way to keep Lore Items in circulation without being destroyed.<br>
- Wholesale crafting - Use various Trade Skills to keep members equipped. Often a good way to acquire a Master level quickly.</p>

<p class="bold">1.2. What is the organizational structure?</p>
<p>There is a semi-organized structure of Wardens and Agents with the Keeper of the Ring (database admin) keeping tabs on recordkeeping. We do not really have any "ranking" or "superiority"---we are simply loosely organized for communication purposes. The bottom line is that we will always remain "loosely" organized and NOT get into heavy-handed legislation, politics, or governing. On the contrary, we are FIRST and FOREMOST freelancing volunteers providing a bit of our time helping each other when possible.</p>

<p class="bold">1.2.1 What are the membership requirements?</p>
<p>The requirements are few.</p>
<p>A Ring applicant must be:<br>
a.)	A member of the "Rogue" class (Rogue, Rake, Blackguard, or Assassin).<br>
b.)	Of level seven (7) or higher.  This enables the applicant to get a taste of the first rogue class-defining skill-Pickpocket!<br>
c.)	Willing to meet with the server Warden within three (3) days of application to be verified of class and level.</p>

<p class="bold">1.2.2. What is a Agent/Warden/Keeper?
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Agent</span>: The average rogue member. We are all agents.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Warden</span>: A volunteer who is willing to be a communication contact point/liason between Agents and the Keeper. Helps confirm class and level of applicants, organize quests, raiding parties, arena events, exploration parties, etc.</p>
<p>As a Ring Warden, you are expected to undertake the following responsibilities...<br>
-- Ring Wardens will be used to confirm both class and level of new applicants. The process for this will be:<br>
a. Rogue applies for Ring membership using the current form.<br>
b. Rogue info will be emailed to the relevent Ring Wardens.<br>
c. Warden(s) will confirm the rogue's status within three (3) days via in-game contact.<br>
d. Warden will then email the Keeper with a confirmation result.<br>
e. Confirmation email will be sent to the rogue applicant immediately following receipt of positive confirmation from the Warden(s).<br>
-- For those servers with more than one Warden, Ring Wardens will establish communication with their fellow server Wardens.  Via email is preferred, though in-game contact, ICQ/Instant Messenger work as well.  This is a good approach to dividing up the "confirmation" responsibilities.<br>
-- It is greatly encouraged that the Wardens interact with their server Agents on a regular basis.  Informal gatherings, quests, and contests are a good way to open up communication, promote comraderie, and create new friendships.  Take advantage of this aspect of being a Warden.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Keeper (of the Ring)</span>: The guy who maintains the Ring database and is a contact for questions/problems with Ring issues. (See below for more info on who to contact.)</p>

<p class="bold">2. Where/How do I sign up?</p>
<p>Register with The Ring database here - (<a href="javascript: popup('add.php3') ;">Sign Up!</a>)</p>

<p class="bold">2.1. Is there an official website?</p>
<p>The Ring is part of the main Safehouse site (<a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">www.thesafehouse.org</a>).</p>

<p class="bold">2.2. Where is my registration confirmation?</p>
<p>After you submit your character info to the database and your class/level have been confirmed by your server Warden, the admin will send you an email confirming your registration, personally selected password, and the current password (not custom) to enter The Root Cellar (a Ring-only message forum)</p>

<p class="bold">2.2.1. What password do I use? EzBoard/Personal?</p>
<p>To update your character listing, use your personally designated password (the one you registered with).</p>
<p>To enter The Root Cellar, use the current Root Cellar password contained within your original Ring registration confirmation email. If you've forgotten the password and no longer have the email, contact the Keeper of the Ring (kezzek@thesafehouse.org) and we'll work something out.</p>

<p class="bold">3. How do I update after registering?</p>
<p>Three easy steps:</p>
- Use the database search tool to find your listing.<br>
- Click on your name to bring up your character info.<br>
- Click on the "Edit Record" link in the lower right corner and make changes in the pop-up window.</p>
<p>NOTE: You will need to submit changes using the your personal password. Changes are not allowed without using the password.</p>

<p class="bold">3.1. Am I notified of changes, like during registration?</p>
<p>No. Changes are made instantly.</p>

<p class="bold">4. Who do I contact with questions or problems about Ring issues?</p>
<p>The Keeper of the Ring is Glip the Gnome (<a href="mailto:glip@thesafehouse.org">Glip@thesafehouse.org</a>)</p>
