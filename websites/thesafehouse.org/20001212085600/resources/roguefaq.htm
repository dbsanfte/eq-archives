      <h1><font size="4">1.0 General questions about the Rogue class</font></h1>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>1.1 Why play a rogue? 
          </b><br>
          There are many reasons one might want to play a rogue. They have many 
          utility skills which make them useful in a variety of situations, namely 
          hide, sneak, instill doubt and safe fall and have the best form of invisibility 
          in the game due to Sneak-Hide. Most importantly, in Everquest, the rogue 
          is capable of doing more melee damage than the other pure melee classes 
          (e.g. warrior, monk), but only with the right equipment and if the rogue 
          doesn't have to face the enemy head-on. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The rogue also gets unique 
          skills, such as Evade, Make Poison, Apply Poison and Pickpockets. The 
          rogue is an auxiliary tank specializing in: complementing the efforts 
          of a tank class (warrior, monk, shadowknight, paladin), effective and 
          deadly scouting, critical corpse recovering, and the deadly art of poisons. 
          In this employ, the rogue can be a significant addition to a smart group. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Think sneaky. Think deadly. 
          Think <i>assassin</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>1.2 What stats/attributes 
          are the most important for a rogue to have?</b><br>
          This is an often debated topic. The general consensus is that dex/agi 
          should be over 100 to keep skills sharp, but that Strength and Armor 
          Class best serve the rogue overall. If you want to do a little more 
          damage, lean towards strength, if you want better defensive capabilities 
          pick armor class.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>1.3 I've heard Rogues 
          have difficulty grouping. Is this true?</b><br>
          The current state of the EQ Rogue is a good one. Many players do not 
          realize the value that high melee damage can bring to the group in minimizing 
          downtime and conserving mana. As a Rogue, your principal job will usually 
          be to deal damage--and lots of it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With one of our special 
          skills called 'evade', we can keep it such that a creature never attacks 
          us, and is always on the high AC, high hit point tank. Not only does 
          this consolidate damage on one target (making the healers life easier), 
          but that tank will take the least amount of damage due to his or her 
          high AC, conserving mana as a whole. You are also <i>the master</i> 
          of corpse recovery, able to pull entire parties out of areas with ease 
          that others could only dream of. Add to this our superior scouting ability 
          and the ability to pick locks in higher level areas, and no group wants 
          to be without a Rogue. With the inclusion of poisons, our utility is 
          even more wide, as we can root, slow, dot, and direct damage an enemy 
          to make encounters that much easier. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Many ideas that Rogues aren't 
          useful stemmed from the initial release of the game where a) we didn't 
          have evade, b) there was no minimum backstab damage, c) we couldn't 
          sneak and hide at the same time, d) our weapons were much more limited, 
          e) and poisons were not in the game. This is no longer the case. Rogues 
          are a wonderful class now.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>1.4 Why should I use 
          poison?</b><br>
          If you have lots of time and money, it can add a lot of flavor to your 
          experiences as a Rogue. You will be more effective in combat if the 
          effect goes off and does inflicts the target successfully. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After several iterations, 
          poison has finally become a viable resource. Though many disagree with 
          when and how often one would use poison, we all agree that the current 
          crop of poisons are not only one of the best and most interesting trade 
          skills, but probably one of most rewarding as well. Be prepared to spend 
          time gather components, raising your skill, and buying the necessary 
          suspensions however. Like most trade skills, it takes time.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>2.2 Is Bind Wound always 
          capped at 100?</b><br>
          No. At level 51, the cap limit is raised. After you skill past 201 in 
          Bind Wounds, the hp percentage cap is raised from 50% to 70%. In addition, 
          the formula for calculating hp gained per bandage changes. At 201 skill, 
          you will do 75 hp per bind. This can be used on yourself OR others. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2.3 What does sneak do, 
          and how can I tell if it worked?</b><br>
          Sneak allows you move <u>behind</u> enemies who would normally attack 
          you. It essentially reduces the radius in which they will attack you. 
          You still should keep your distance, as sneak is by no means equivalent 
          to invisibility, unless you are hiding as well. As a Rogue, it will 
          tell you if you are successful or not ("You are as quiet as a cat stalking 
          its prey"). For most creatures, once you are successfully sneaking, 
          they will &quot;con&quot; (/consider) indifferent. Kunark mobs are notorious 
          for conning as &quot;scowling&quot; (hostile) even with successful sneak 
          though they likely will not attack. Be aware that hide is an invisibility, 
          but sneak is <u>not</u>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now comes the best part 
          about sneak. The "secret handshake". If you have bad faction (whether 
          through combat, race, or religion) with a Merchant, you can neutralize 
          the hostility by "Sneaking" behind the merchant. Use Sneak while standing 
          behind the merchant and you will change their hostility level to "Indifferent" 
          and you will be able to make transactions. This works for every vendor 
          though some are more dangerous than others (groupings of Merchants where 
          sneak doesn't affect merchants behind <u>you</u>.) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2.4 What does hide do, 
          and how can I tell if it worked?</b><br>
          Hide is like invisibility, but much more reliable, but it doesn't cost 
          any mana either. It most likely won't work reliably until level 10+, 
          and even then there's no guarantee until you've mastered the skill. 
          As a Rogue, the in-game text will tell you if you are successful or 
          not. You can also tell if it worked by considering (/con)an enemy while 
          hidden - if they regard you indifferently, then your hide was successful 
          (though some mobs, mostly in Kunark, may continue to consider as &quot;scowling&quot;). 
          You will remain hidden until you turn Hide off or you move without Sneak. 
          The most reliable method of determining Hide success is to use the F9 
          key and view yourself using an external, 3rd-person POV camera. With 
          successful hiding, you will not be able to see yourself in 3rd-person 
          point of view. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some races receive Hide 
          at a "racial skill" level at the start of the game. This means that 
          their Hide ability is 50 (or the equivalent of level 10) and will not 
          improve through use until the player reaches level 11. Races include 
          Dark Elf, Halfling, and Wood-Elf. </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><b>2.4.1 What can knock me out of hiding? </b><br>
            Your own party members are the biggest risk here. Any spell cast upon 
            you, beneficial or otherwise will knock you out of hiding. This can 
            be extremely dangerous when scouting. A Bard's songs can be a Rogue's 
            worst enemy when sneaking! When scouting for your party, let your 
            group know to not cast on you or use bard songs. </p>
          <p>Looting corpses (even your own) will also knock you out of hiding, 
            so greed can get you killed if the area is not clear. When trying 
            to recover your own corpse, use the /corpse command to drag your body 
            to a safer spot before looting. Dragging corpses will not ruin your 
            hide. Picking Pockets will also ruin your hide, so be careful! </p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2.4.2 What is the benefit 
            of Sneak-Hide?</b><br>
            Using sneak and hide at the same time (Sneak-Hide) allows a rogue 
            to move while invisible to most mobs and players! The rogue is "invisible" 
            to most mobs and players with the exception of those that can cast 
            "See Invisible". </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Unlike the spell invisibility 
            or invisibility versus undead, sneak hide can be activated at the 
            press of a button, sometimes so fast that a mob at the zone won't 
            see you if you press it immediately. As a Rogue, you are in no risk 
            of your invisibility breaking at a bad time. However, there is a very 
            small chance, rumored to be based on your level, that determines if 
            a mob can see through your invis. Some mobs also just plain see anything. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition, sneak and 
            hide succeeds where all magical forms of invisibility fail. Many zones 
            are only safely navigatable by Rogues--all other classes beware. However, 
            it drops when you zone, so be prepared. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Starting at 51st level, 
            you begin to move faster while sneaking. By 60th level, you are at 
            a full run, and this combines with any speed spells. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This skill is highly valued 
            for maneuvering in dungeons, scouting or corpse recovery.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2.5 What is evade? When 
          do I get it?</b><br>
          Evade is a skill you receive at the same level as Hide that allows the 
          rogue to not be the target of an angry creature. By targeting a creature 
          in combat, shutting off auto-attack and hitting the hide button. This 
          is harder than it sounds: for a successful evade, you must be standing 
          still as well as not attacking. A successful evade will lower the aggression 
          that the creature has towards the rogue. Essentially, the rogue is placed 
          lower on the "Hate List" of the creature targeted. This is commonly 
          used to help shift the attention of the creature from the rogue to the 
          primary tank. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Furthermore, its not as 
          much how you evade as <u>when</u>. Evade takes practice, but an experienced 
          rogue can help spread around the damage to the tanks while minimizing 
          personal damage. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2.6 How do you pick locks?</b><br>
          Apparently there is a bug that is expecting the rogue to get picklock 
          skill at level 11, not a level 6. When you first get picklock skill 
          and add a point to it, you get it at your current level (6). Now when 
          you try to pick the door in Befallen, it won't work because you're not 
          at level 11 like the code says you should. Therefore the door does not 
          open nor do you gain experience. You <u>must</u> put at least five (5) 
          practice points into Pick Lock skill to get it up to skill level 11. 
          Once there, the door in Befallen opens like butter!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The only doors you may 
          pick are ones with the message: "This door is locked and you don't have 
          the key." There is no message for failing an attempt, only for succeeding. 
          To attempt to pick a lock, click on your picklocks so that they are 
          now stuck to your cursor. Then click on the door to attempt to open 
          it. Or use your "U" key on your keyboard (or whatever key you've defined 
          as "Use".) This prevents the potential for dropping or accidental trade 
          initiations. </font></p>

            You target an NPC or monster and click the 'pick pockets' skill button. 
            Upon success, you will be given some coinage, or rarely, an item that 
            was in the target's inventory. It is best to use this skill on something 
            you plan to fight anyway. Because if you are detected, the creature 
            will attack you. You can only raise skill or successfully pickpocket 
            humanoid creatures. Animals and skeletons can not be pickpocketed. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The best way to use the 
            skill is to turn your autoattack off briefly, try to pickpocket, then 
            turn autoattack back on until you can pickpocket again. It is best 
            to setup your hotkeys to make it as easy as possible. Also keep in 
            mind that for some players there is a bug in which if your weapon 
            effect goes off at the same time you are toggling skills, it locks 
            up your macro buttons until you zone or relog. For picked coinage, 
            the amount stolen decreases with each successive attempt on a given 
            target, typically by a factor of two with fractions rounded downwards. 
            If you are pickpocketing NPCs, and not killing them, it is not clear 
            when the amount you are able to pick in a given shot goes back up, 
            but it does after a time. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also, it should be noted 
            that humanoid mobs (humans, orcs, etc.) will shout "Stop thief!&quot; 
            if you fail your pickpocket attempt badly enough. This will alert 
            anyone within hearing distance that you are pickpocketing the mob. 
            In other words, some players may take offense to this. Pickpocketing 
            guards as you run past them out of town can be a profitable hobby 
            as well. Be sure you are ready to run however! </font></p>

          An extra attack the rogue gains at level 10. To backstab, a piercing 
          weapon must be equipped as the primary melee weapon. Thus, all rogues 
          should try to have piercing skill maxed by level 10. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To backstab, simply target 
          an enemy, get behind it and click the backstab button. You will hit 
          for damage times a multiplier based on your backstab skill. Keep in 
          mind your damage will be much lower (on average) against difficult targets 
          (yellow and red cons). Regardless if you hit or miss, the backstab works 
          like a taunt, and the target often will turn it's attention to you. 
          If you use the backstab attack from the front, it counts as an extra, 
          normal pierce attack, but it will not trigger double attack and/or dual 
          wield. You also will not gain skill points in backstab using it from 
          the front. The skill is fairly hard to raise unless you group constantly.

          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2.7.1 How is backstab 
            damage calculated? </b><br>
            Nothing is official, but the general belief is that at low levels, 
            it works something like this: Assuming that you are using a weapon 
            deemed 'acceptable' for your level (i.e. not too powerful [some players 
            report getting very high level weapons at lower levels and not getting 
            the damage they were supposed to until they leveled some more]), max 
            damage is calculated as: (DMG * 2) + 1 + ((level - 25)/3) + ((STR+SKILL)/100) 
            Backstab simply multiplies this by a constant factor. We approximate 
            this factor to be: </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(BACKSTAB_SKILL / 25) 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So a maxed level 10 rogue 
            has a backstab multiplier of (55 / 25) = 2.2x. Assuming he's using 
            a giant snake fang (DMG 5, so max damage (5 * 2) + 1 = 11), his level 
            10 max backstab will be (11 * 2.2x) = 24. Backstab damage caps at 
            25 * DMG at level 50. Towards level 20, these numbers skew. Backstab 
            seems to top out for a time, and then go up rapidly in the higher 
            20s. Strength effects how often you hit for max damage, so be sure 
            to have STR enhancing equip and/or STR buffs on you as often as possible. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At 51st, the new minimum 
            backstab damage is <i>Level*3/2</i>, rounded down. 76 is the least

          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>3.3.1 Can disarm be 
            used against PCs wielding magical weapons?</b><br>
            Yes . In a PvP situation, rogues and monks can currently disarm <u>any</u> 
            weapon wielded by the opposing player. The weapon in question is dropped 
            into the inventory of the disarmed player, or, if no slots are available, 
            is placed on the cursor of the disarmed player. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3.4 What types of armor 
          can a rogue wear? </b><br>
          Everything but bronze, steel, and certain other types of plate armor. 
          </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3.4.1 What is Ravenscale?</b><br>
            The Rogue's class specific armor is Ravenscale, found in Cazic Thule. 
            It is black and one of the rogue's pride and joys. Because it is dropped 
            and not quested for like other class armor, most rogues either save 
            all their money for Ravenscale or go to Cazic-Thule in their mid 20's-early 
            30's. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3.5 What is this Burning 
          Rapier?</b><br>
          The burning rapier is the "special" rogue class weapon. It has the following 
          stats:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Dmg: 7 Delay: 20<br>
          Special Effect: Ignite (37 pt direct damage) <br>
          +5 bonus to Dexterity <br>
          +5 bonus to Agility. </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As to how to get it, there 
          is a long thread in the library under "Book of Knowledge: Rogue Redemption 
          Quest" which should spell out this long and difficult quest in more 
          detail. </font></p>
