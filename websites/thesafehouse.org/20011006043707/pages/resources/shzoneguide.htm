                Description</b> <br>
                Blackburrow is a low level dungeon that can safely be approached 
                at about level six, and is conquered near completely by level 
                seventeen or so. Coming from Queynos, Blackburrow is located on 
                the far east wall of the Queynos hills zone between the ruins 
                and the guard tower. The safest route from Queynos involves heading 
                straight out down the road till you hit the first fork you see 
                and make a right. Take that road to the guard tower and just before 
                you enter the pass to the Karanas hang a left and hug the wall 
                of the zone keeping the mountains close to your right. At low 
                levels be wary of the rabid bears, wolves and other nasties in 
                this area...you may want to stay hidden for a large part of the 
                journey until you are comfortable. And DON'T attack animals of 
                any kind (even rabid) when you see Cros Trewind or Holly Windstalker 
                abouts....you will die quick. When you see a gray gnoll's head 
                jutting out from the rock enticing you into it's maw...you have 
                reached Blackburrow. <br>
                <br>
                Coming from the everfrost side is a bit harder to describe, as 
                it involves about six or seven forks. If you are a newbie Barbarian 
                who just reached fifth or sixth and are ready to start Blackburrow, 
                a guide might be the wisest course of action. My best advice for 
                the low levels headed to Blackburrow are to stop and /con ANY 
                skeletons you see. If you see anything with the words VENGEFUL 
                in them move out of it's way..and activate your hide skill. If 
                you ever leave the peaks and see wide open space this is bad you 
                shouldn't be here. Turn around and ask directions. The entrance 
                to Blackburrow from the everfrost side has a ramp similar to the 
                one coming out of Halas and looks like it a bit but here...the 
                guards just aren't as nice. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Blackburrow 
                is a perfect dungeon for a low level rogue to practice in. You 
                can go just about anywhere under the cover of hide/sneak and let 
                your group buddies know what's up. Just don't get too balsy at 
                low levels and you'll be fine. There is ok money to be had if 
                you know where to look. You won't get rich here alone, but you 
                will be well on your way by the time you leave. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
                biggest disadvantages mostly are due to location. Other than half-elves 
                and Barbarians no roguish race starts anywhere near here. Most 
                of the teleports I have seen involve N. Karana making the trek 
                a long one, necessitating the long navigation of W. Karana, a 
                zone as a low level that you only want to go through either in 
                stealth or with a good escort. The other bad part of the Blackburrow 
                area is that it is tough to transact or to do business here unless 
                you are dealing in Blackburrow merchandise. Want a Dragoon Dirk 
                or Tentacle whip? Don't come here looking for it. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">There 
                is a lot to be obtained here if you want to look for it, and have 
                a good system. At first most of the drops consist of cloth articles 
                and such. Cracked staves go for nearly a plat each to vendors, 
                so look for gnolls that carry big sticks. Other than that, provided 
                below is a list of whats available, what it does, etc. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Ruined 
                Gnoll Pelt- Many gnolls...pretty much useless...destroy them unless 
                you want to have PP fun. <br>
                Gnoll Pelt- Found on Elites, Shamans, Commanders, Brewers and 
                (rarely) Guardsmen. -used for at least one quest, the monk headband...you 
                usually can get 2pp each for these on the open market, less from 
                vendors. Also usable for poison vials <br>
                Gnoll Skin- A rare drop overall, can be found on Shamans, High 
                Shamans, Commanders and sometimes elites, used for the same quest 
                as above plus the rogue Burning Rapier quest. These usually go 
                for 4pp-5pp on the open market. <br>

                Fangs- these are no drop items that make Blackburrow a hidden 
                gem. These can be cashed in to Captain Tillian in the arena in 
                Queynos, for eps and moonstones, which in turn can be given to 
                Mcneal Jacob at the Fish's ale pub for BB stout and MORE xps. 
                I still get xps for these fangs even at 20th, though of course 
                not as much. I would recommend this route instead of giving them 
                to the warrior guild in Halas because there are no hits with the 
                rogues guild in Queynos when u turn these in. In Halas you WILL 
                take a guild hit. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Spiked 
                Collar +3str/3ac- Found on Elites and Commanders, often difficult 
                to sell, but when they do usually go for around 2pp, vendors will 
                give you close to one for em' for I usually just do that. </font></p>

                Ring- Found in the base of the central pond, used in the paw of 
                Oppola quest. Easy to get so it won't usually fetch much on the 
                open market, but hey you can sell it to vendors for a few gold. 
                Oh and if you aren't good at swimming don't go fetching it till 
                your at least tenth. Razorgill will eat ya alive. </font></p>

                Earrings +2 Agi. Found on Elites(rare) and often found on commies 
                and high shamans, usually go for 1pp on the market if that, far 
                less from a vendor. I liked to give these away to newbies around 
                Queynos. Can't have too many friends...never know if they'll be 
                a twinked, powerlevelled caster that'll invite you into a group 
                some day.(hehe) </font></p>

                usually go for 2-3pp at most on the market. Again I'd rather give 
                em away to a newbie. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Blackburrow 
                Cask- Found on brewers (rarely) or Master Brewers. A very rare 
                drop that is essential in completing the Jaggedpine Cloak quest 
                (where three are needed) or as a mixing vessel for the burning 
                rapier quest. This is a VERY rare drop and people come into BB 
                all the time shouting &quot;looking to buy casks&quot; The spot 
                where the most common brewer spawning ground if often camped by 
                some high level character trying in frustration to get one. You 
                can sell one for 20pp easy, and often more if the buyer is bored 
                out of his wits. Good item to camp if you like that kind of thing. 
                </font></p>

                Snake Fangs- 5 dam/ 27 delay. Found on giant snakes. A very common 
                newbie rogue item. Usually sell for about 6gp maximum. Often they 
                are given away, so if your new here and want one, just ask and 
                you'll often get one. </font></p>

                quest, otherwise not too useful I've heard of them being sold 
                for about 1pp, but it usually takes too much time to find a buyer.

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Snake 
                Poison Sacs- Found on Giant Snakes- Blackburrow is a great hunting 
                ground for these. There are giant snakes in abundance and they 
                usually have a decent drop rate of these sacs. The only problem 
                with the snakes is that they are fast, so a root spell from a 
                friend would help. I never tried to sell mine, as I liked to bank 
                them for future use myself, but they usually fetch 1pp per sac.

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
                &quot;Big&quot; Elite room- Located just up the dirt ramp and 
                to the left from the snake pit , this is the exclusive spot for 
                the High Shaman to spawn. This room also contains elites, commanders 
                and regular shamans. This is the toughest room in the dungeon 
                and of course the best loot. Skins seem to drop with more frequency 
                here, but can be acquired from other places. Try not to let the 
                mobs or elites escape from this room when holding it, they will 
                go to the small elite room and bring in more fun than can often 
                safely be handled. This room full contains 2 &quot;specials&quot; 
                and four elites, with 2 guardsmen closely outside. A party of 
                at least four thirteenth level characters are needed to hold this 
                room effectively. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
                &quot;small&quot; Elite room- This is located past the Big elite 
                room in the warren. Commanders and elites spawn here mainly. This 
                is the next high level spot that's camped if the &quot;big&quot; 
                elite room is camped. It is tougher to catch escapees here, they 
                often make it to the door and aggro the guards outside. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
                elite ledge- This is the spot for those who are just starting 
                to take on the big boys. To get to it go to the safe area in the 
                basement take the long bridge to the island, and then take the 
                bridge up to the ledge. <br>
                Two elites typically spawn here along with an occasional gnoll/ 
                patrolling mixed in. Kill the little ones quick they will be a 
                headache when the elites come. This can be effectively camped 
                by at least 2 14th level characters. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
                commander room- Under the elite ledge lies a small room guarded 
                on the outside by a Burly gnoll and 2 regular gnolls. Watch out 
                for the burlies they can be a bit of a surprise for the lower 
                levels. Upon entering the room, there are 3 regular gnolls and 
                a spawn point for one &quot;special&quot; that rotates between 
                a commander, an elite and a shaman. The spawn time for the special 
                isnt that fast, so rogues often have a chance to heal. However 
                make sure you kill the gnolls if they run they will fetch the 
                burly or a guardsman. <br>
                In a pinch they can be death for ya. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
                snake pit- This is an area this is popular for the lower levels 
                in the dungeon as giant snakes have no poison and are relatively 
                harmless. IMO however this area is too dangerous. Close by is 
                the elite room and many of the trains that come out of there come 
                through here sometimes carrying between 10-20 happy gnolls in 
                tow. There are also a lot of guards around, so be sure you activate 
                your hide before you go in and out of here. The last obstacle 
                to using this place is it's cryptic location. If you don't know 
                BB too well it is easy to get lost. But if you are high level, 
                know BB and know your way round this is the place to go. </font></p>

                Grizzly Bear- Don't ask me why a grizzly bear appears here but 
                it occasionally does, and always on the upper level. It drops 
                the usual items (Grizzly Pelt, meat, etc.) Nothing special about

                spawns just after whacking it. It too spawns at the top and will

                They will not leave unless provoked, but if you fall in the pond

                each. The are not poisonous, so in many ways they are an excellent

                Bridges - Down below you will see all kinds of bridges crisscrossing 
                here and there. These are a danger and often a pain. Do NOT think 
                you will escape a mob by jumping off them...all you will do is 
                flee slower and get hit more often as they pummel you from above 
                without you being able to counter. Not to mention the pain of

                your body from this deep pit requires some help. </font></p>

                quick. And if you insist go all the way in stealth mode. Don't

                TRAINS - Hehe one of the more infamous features of BB. When you 
                hear this phrase if possible hide immediately and evaluate the 
                train. They are good backstab practice, but only if you can handle 
                the monster being targeted. Often these get routed to the safe 
                area by the main bridge down below. Also get a feel for who is 
                making these trains...if they do it often they are usually doing 
                it on purpose. My take on this is let them die, they will kill 
                plenty more in their wake. Help only those in genuine need. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">5. 
                Razorgill - The fish in the central pond can be pulled easy and 
                often one at a time! Near brewers rock there is a small river 
                which is overflow from the central pond..if u dive a little and 
                face the central pond area you will often see the razorgill sitting 
                there stagnant. Without going in to the central pond pull out 
                your trusty bow and skewer one...they will come outside the central 
                pond and you can get easy kills this way excellent for chars in

                snakes - These are all over the place and are often good safe 
                hunting. I would not recommend going to the snake pit to do it 
                though. There are plenty of spawn points for these, and they don't 
                have to be right next door to the toughest room in the dungeon. 
                A snare/ root helps A LOT in hunting these..they skitter FAST 
                in this dungeon and I have trouble killing them with a SOW at 
                higher levels. Best tactic is to try and sit down hopefully they'll 
                come back. </font></p>

                - Lots of good places to practice this here. The main bridge down 
                below is great. You can do quick loops here forever and its one 
                of the safest areas in the dungeon. Damage is at max 4 hps. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">8.Safe 
                area - The safe area down below actually isnt all that safe. Mobs 
                can still hit ya even up cave wall....so if you hear TRAIN jump 
                and get ready. Otherwise this area is good eps. Hang around the 
                bridge and group with pals to knock off gnolls and patrolling

                will see a long spindly bridge that goes to an island and eventually 
                goes to the elite ledge, On this bridge and island there are often 
                gnolls with bow and arrow. You can get A LOT of arrows real quick 
                here perfect for pulling. </font></p>

                The Hollow Tree - Up above you will see a large tree, that is 
                hollowed out to make a little mini alcove. It is always empty. 
                DO NOT GO IN unless you can rumble, you will go to the lowest 
                level of the dungeon. The floor is fake and drops you into a pool 
                surrounded by three patrolling gnolls with heavier support close 
                at hand. </font></p>

                into water you will swim in stealth mode. You just will go slow

                The Elusive Brewer - Just as you get below to the safe area you 
                will see a large bridge. If you step on that bridge and stop you 
                will see a large rock to your right close to the water. Right 
                by that rock the Master Brewer Spawns, his place held by a guardsman 
                or a regular brewer. This is the kill that provides the elusive 
                BB cask, an item used in a ranger quest, and of course the burning 
                rapier quest. SOMETHING spawns on the rock every 18 mins. Quite 
                often it's a guardsman. From all I've been able to determine its 
                completely random what spawns. I have found no pattern that can 
                be verified. </font></p>

                Seeing in the dark - If you are a fledgling barbarian go head 
                and get a quick beetle eye from Queynos hills. It is a long dark 
                tunnel coming in from the Everfrost side, so the first time you 
                will need a guide, or a lantern. </font></p>

                He usually spawns right after the giant plague rat is killed,

                Description</b> <br>
                The Lost Temple of Cazic Thule is a tropical temple populated 
                by an intelligent race of lizard people. The lizards are skilled 
                in the clerical arts and don&#146;t take kindly to visitors disturbing 
                their prayers and meditations. Cazic Thule is one of the most 
                experience and loot-rich zones in the game for players in the 
                mid 20&#146;s up to the high 30&#146;s. Most lizards of level 
                25 and higher carry fine steel weapons, which sell to merchants 
                for over 5pp and players for around 10pp. Lizards often carry 
                several platinum in coin are are nice marks for pickpocketing. 
                In addition to pickpocketing gold and platinum, you can often 
                filch runes, words, pages, and gems. The named lizards and other 
                monsters carry the spectacular Ravenscale Armor, a rogue-only 
                replacement for rubicite armor. In addition, several quest items 
                for other class-specific armor can be found here. The rich lizards, 
                Ravenscale armor, quest items for other classes, and seemingly 
                continuous experience make Cazic Thule a VERY popular dungeon. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Location 
                and directions </b><br>
                The Temple of Cazic Thule is nestled in the fork of a north-south 
                running river on the southern edge of Feerott. It can be approached 
                from the east (Innothule Swamp) or west (Rathe Mountains). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Warning: 
                Be very careful in Feerott. It is the newbie zone for ogres and 
                is appropriately populated by extremely tough Ogre Bouncers (guards). 
                Many of them, particularly Bouncer Hurd, wander the zone and can 
                kill a level 30 rogue in about 20 seconds. Additionally, there 
                is a cave in the southwest corner of the zone that is guarded 
                by spectres. I rarely, if ever, travel Feerott without SoW. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">From 
                the Innothule swamp, zone into Feerott and follow the left hand 
                wall south then west until you hit the east fork of the river. 
                Swim the river and continue west along the southern wall until 
                you reach a huge ramp. Run up the ramp and enter Cazic. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">From 
                the Rathe Mountains, zone into Feerott and follow the right hand 
                wall south then east until you hit the west fork of the river. 
                Be careful of Spectres as the entrance to PoF is near the SE corner. 
                Swim the river and continue east along the south wall until you 
                reach the ramp. Follow the ramp up and into Cazic. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Teleporting</b> 
                <br>
                For the daring and well-connected rogue, there is a wizard gate 
                point located deep inside Cazic Thule. If you have some high level 
                wizard friends, this can make your trip into and out of Cazic 
                very easy. I use it quite a bit and haven&#146;t had a problem 
                yet. Be warned, however, that the gate point is in a very confusing, 
                deadly area of Cazic. Have your wizard cast invisibility on you 
                before you gate! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Binding, 
                buying, selling, and banking</b> <br>
                Binding: The closest bind point for rogues is The Arena, two zones 
                to the west of Feerott. The Arena is a PvP zone but is not PvP 
                in the entrance hallway and can be safely entered. The Arena is 
                usually devoid of players so you should ask for a bind while in 
                the adjacent zone (Lake Rathe). Usually, you can talk a kind caster 
                into zoning into The Arena with you to bind you. Your other option 
                for a bind is Freeport. It seems like a long way away from Cazic 
                but isn&#146;t that bad of a run. It is usually quite easy to 
                get a SoW in Freeport and this will reduce your run time significantly. 
                I usually bind in Freeport as it sometimes takes a while to find 
                a caster to bind you in the arena. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
                you don't mind taking a small risk, you can actually bind inside 
                Ogguk! Sneak/Hide pass those 2 bouncer at ogguk entrance. Zone 
                in and ask a caster to bind you. The bouncers inside Ogguk rarely 
                be trained to the zone entrance. This is very safe place. I never 
                have a problem with Ogguk citizens. Sometimes it might be hard 
                to find someone to bind you, as Ogguk is usually empty. It might 
                be a good idea to find someone in Cazic or Feerott willing to 
                bind you before actually going inside Ogguk. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Buying, 
                selling, and banking: There are several merchants in the Rathe 
                Mountains that you can use to dump your loot and buy food, water, 
                and bandages. The nearest bank, however, is in Freeport. This 
                can be quite a problem for rogues, as we are typically overloaded 
                with coins and loot. Additionally, the abundance of fine steel 
                weapons will quickly weigh down even the strongest rogue. Fortunately, 
                enterprising players have found a way to make a little money themselves 
                and help you out in the process. Often in Cazic, you will hear 
                a players shout &quot;Banking at zone!&quot; This means the player 
                will perform banking, buying, and selling services for a small 
                price. Many will buy fine steel weapons from you for 3-4pp each. 
                Some will change gold and silver for platinum. Many will sell 
                food, water, and bandages. This benefits you as it saves a long 
                run to Freeport and benefits them as they make a bit of money 
                off each item. Even with players banking, I usually need to make 
                a Freeport run about once every 2-3 days. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Yes, 
                with a little risk it is possible to trade with the Feerott merchants. 
                By the stone bridge, turn right and after a while you will meet 
                2 green (to a Lvl 30) Ogre merchants. Sneak/hide and buy/sell 
                fletching supplies, and a few other things, except food/water. 
                Keep going and not far from these 2 merchants, you will see an 
                Inn. The merchant inside is Red to a Lvl 30, but just sneak/hide 
                and buy water/food and bandages from him. <br>
                IMPORTANT: when you buy/sell to these merchants, you must sneak/hide 
                and trade behind them. Reason: after you finish, you will be unhidden, 
                even though the button will still be actived. Unhide and hide 
                again, and walk away. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Again, 
                if you like to take a risk...you CAN use the Ogguk bank. Once 
                you enter Ogguk, sneak/hide and just follow the right wall, keep 
                going until you meet 2 bouncers guarding an entrance. Go between 
                them and take the left tunnel. Don't turn left again until you 
                run into a ledge above water. Take a left turn and you will see 
                a door. This door is Ogguk Keep. There is a bouncer and banker 
                inside. Enter and keep going pass the merchant into his bed chamber. 
                So, you are actually shielded by the wall and face the back of 
                the banker. Do your trading like normal, and after finish, REMEMBER 
                TO UNHIDE AND HIDE before you go out or the bouncer will be on 
                you. Best way to bank here is get a SOW so that you don't have 
                to walk the whole time. Takes about 3-5 min with SOW, around 8-10 
                min without SOW. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Groups 
                </b><br>
                Like any dungeon for relatively higher level characters, almost 
                every class needs a strong group to survive. There are areas which 
                are soloable by rogues but the downtime associated with soloing 
                makes it unproductive to say the least. Full groups are the norm 
                in Cazic and are fairly easy to find and/or form. The replacement 
                of the highly sought-after rubicite armor with rogue-only Ravenscale 
                has significantly reduced the population of Cazic; but there are 
                still plenty of valuable items and experience to lure adventurers 
                of all classes. Both Shadow-knights and Shaman have armor quest 
                items that are found here. Lizard scale cloaks are now part of 
                a wizard quest. So even though the average population of Cazic 
                has dropped from over 50 to under 30, there are still lots of 
                people to group with. While it can be easy to form a Rogue-heavy 
                group, you should ALWAYS leave room for a healer. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Hiding 
                </b><br>
                While the deadly trains and the dangers of bouncers in Feerott 
                leave a sea of corpses in their wake, you have a distinct advantage 
                as a Rogue. So long as you were not detected previously, you can 
                hide to avoid most confrontations. As a general rule, I am hidden 
                most of the time - unless in combat of course. You never know 
                when a dozen lizzies are going to come out of no where. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Fighting</b> 
                <br>
                Cazic Thule has several distinct areas for fighting. I will discuss 
                the ones I am familiar with; which are the ones for rogues in 
                the mid 20&#146;s to low 30&#146;s. Generally, fighting in Cazic 
                is just like any other dungeon you&#146;ve fought in and the same 
                warnings apply. Trains are deadly, reds spawn at the worst times, 
                and full groups are recommended. The main difference between Cazic 
                Thule and the other dungeons you&#146;ve encountered is that Cazic 
                is a temple and is heavily populated by clerical lizards. You 
                know how that wonderful cleric in YOUR group has saved your rogue 
                arse on countless occasions? Well the lizard clerics in Cazic 
                are just as intent on saving their own group&#146;s tails. Possibly 
                the most frustrating thing in all of Norrath is to be close to 
                finishing off the last red Lizard Fanatic as most of your group 
                is below 2 bubbles of health and all your casters are out of mana 
                only to watch the Fanatic&#146;s hp bar go 90% of the way to full 
                because you forgot that one Lizard Herald in the corner. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Here 
                are the main fighting areas: </b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Zone Hallway <br>
                The short, L-shaped hallway at the zone border can be a nasty 
                place. Even though just a few steps from relative safety, it is 
                usually littered with corpses. Trains from all over Cazic Thule 
                are brought to this zone and can quickly chew up an unsuspecting 
                rogue. Unlike most dungeons, very little fighting intentionally 
                happens here due to the chance of being run over by a train. Few 
                people actually pull to the zone. Nonetheless, this is still my 
                preferred place for bringing lizards for soloing. I fight with 
                my back against the wall so I can look down the hallway and as 
                soon as ANYTHING goes bad, I step out. One other way to solo here 
                is to patiently remain hidden at the zone and wait for someone 
                else to pull some lizards there. You can either pull one off his 
                group if he wants help or pick the last remaining lizard off the 
                bunch as they retreat after he zones. The hallway is populated 
                by several very low level lizards that can basically be ignored. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Courtyard <br>
                The large, open courtyard (also called the CY) is the hub for 
                most areas of Cazic. It&#146;s one of the laggiest areas I&#146;ve 
                found in Norrath and can be deadly as all trains must pass through 
                here one the way to the zone. It&#146;s populated by lots of low 
                level lizards that will usually ignore anyone over level 25 or 
                so. There are two huge trees in the zone that are out of the normal 
                path to the zone and are relatively safe places for groups to 
                fight lizards pulled from other areas. One of the trees, the one 
                in the northeast, has a safe spot behind it that is actually safer 
                to camp in than the zone. The most common technique for players 
                under level 28 or so is to pull lizards out of the maze and fight 
                them in the Couryard. This is a great way to earn experience and 
                loot and is relatively safe as it is so close to the zone. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Maze <br>
                The maze, located behind the east door in the courtyard, is a 
                confusing series of tunnels populated by Lizard Warders (low 20&#146;s), 
                Defenders (mid 20&#146;s), and Sentinals (mid-high 20&#146;s). 
                Defenders and Sentinals, when they carry weapons, always carry 
                fine steel. Warders carry rusty or bronze. Some of the lizards 
                spawn and stay stationary while others roam. The maze can be very 
                dangerous for two reasons. First, it&#146;s very easy to get lost 
                in there. Second, the winding tunnels make it difficult to pull 
                a single lizard to your party without dragging some of his friends 
                along. A full group of 6 in the mid 20&#146;s should be able to 
                handle 2-3 warders and defenders pretty easily. Soloists should 
                be VERY careful to only pull one. At level 30, I only solo when 
                waiting for a spot to open up in a group and then do it very cautiously. 
                I will stand, hidden, right near the door to the maze and wait 
                for a lone defender or sentinal carrying a weapon (might as well 
                make some money, right?) to pass by. I will then quickly backstab 
                him and pull him to the zone or to a tree to fight. If more than 
                one comes, I zone immediately. This technique is effective but 
                still leaves me with a 10 minutes arse-sitting after each battle 
                (even with a maxed-out bind wounds skill). It&#146;s much more 
                efficient to find a group. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Gator pools <br>
                Deep below Cazic Thule are two underground pools. From the courtyard, 
                you climb either of the two ladders on the south wall and enter 
                the hallway at the top. Descend to a water-filled vertical shaft 
                and swim a long way to the first pool, the Blue Pool (BP). This 
                blue-lit pool is filled with small alligators (much smaller than 
                the crocs found in Oasis) and offers excellent experience. The 
                gators range in level all the way from about 22 to above 35 and 
                hit extremely hard. A level 40 ranger friend of mine still gets 
                experience from some of these gators. On my very first trip to 
                Cazic, a gator had been pulled to the zone just as I zoned in. 
                I looked down and thought &quot;How cute!&quot; right before it 
                bit me for 65 damage. Past the blue pool is a dry tunnel where 
                groups can fight gators pulled from the pool. At the other end 
                of that tunnel is the Green Pool (GP) which is also home to gators 
                as well as a few lizards and the Steel Golem. The Golem sometimes 
                drops the coveted Ravenscale Gloves and can be taken out by a 
                group of low 30&#146;s. The pools are relatively boring areas 
                and devoid of loot (alligators sometimes carry runes or pages 
                but little else) but are incredible areas to gain experience. 
                As with most other areas, full parties are typical so make friends 
                fast and look for shouts from groups looking for members. Make 
                sure your swimming skill is high, as it&#146;s a long way to the 
                zone. I took a rogue guildmate into the pools to meet my group 
                once but didn&#146;t know his swimming skill was below 10. He 
                died before he made it out of the well shaft, barely half way 
                to dry land. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Throne Room <br>
                This is one of, if not the most popular areas of Cazic Thule for 
                anyone from about level 27 to level 35. It&#146;s relatively close 
                to the zone, offers an unending supply of monsters ranging from 
                level 23-35, and is brimming with loot. The Throne Room, or TR, 
                is accessed through the single door on the west wall of the court 
                yard and then making a right at the &quot;T&quot; intersection. 
                The entrance area is a large open room with wide steps leading 
                inside to a small throne area. Inside you will find Lizard Warders, 
                Defenders, Sentinals, Protectors, Pages, Heralds, Justicators, 
                Zealots, Fanatics, and more. There are also two hard-hitting Hulking 
                Gorillas and two named lizards, the Tae Ew Diviner and the Tae 
                Ew Templar. Finally, in the tower above the TR, the Stone Golem 
                spawns. The Templar drops either the lizard scale mantel or lizard 
                scale cloak and, infrequently, the Ravenscale Greaves (legs). 
                The Diviner also drops the mantel or cloak and sometimes the Ravenscale 
                Bracer. The Stone Golem drops the Ravenscale Coif. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Typically, 
                groups in the high 20&#146;s and low 30&#146;s will form in the 
                corners of the first room and pull from the TR. Group etiquette 
                is important as no one wants the TR to become a free-for-all so 
                make sure you know which group is in line to get the next &quot;named&quot; 
                lizard. Higher level (30+) groups will often camp the top of the 
                tower. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Temple <br>
                The Temple is located on the north end of the maze. It is an impressive 
                multi-level pyramid which is covered from top to bottom with higher 
                level lizards (Protectors, Fanatics, zealots, etc.). The inside 
                of the pyramid is hollow and falling inside will drop you into 
                the Green Pool. Full groups of level 30+ are required to stay 
                alive in this area. </font></p>

                Avatar of Fear&#146;s Room <br>
                If you take a left when heading towards the throne room instead 
                of a right, you will eventually end up in the lair of the Avatar 
                of Fear. To get into the Avatar room, you need to swim out into 
                a blue pool, and when you get above the green bubble, you swim 
                down into it. To escape from the Avatar room, you need to run 
                up the supporting pillars of the green bubble, and jump into the 
                green bubble, then once you swim near the top, you need to jump 
                again to get out of the green bubble and into the blue pool. Sounds 
                confusing, but it will make sense when you get there. Full groups 
                of level 35+ are required here. </font></p>

                - Reavers: Level 50-52. 99% magic resistance, lure series from 
                melee range seems to be only effective spell against them. Proc 
                blind spell which (as far as I've seen) cannot be cured. When 
                dead spawn a new reaver, a lord or nothing. Not uncommon to see 
                5 or more reavers spawn in a row before lord spawns. When first 
                mob is dead, any mob that spawns after that will stay in the area 
                for at least 76 hours. If too many reavers have spawned and healers 
                OOM, zone or port out and try again, the reaver or lord will still 
                be there. Be aware that reavers summon, so running to zone is 
                difficult, but its better than a full party whipe out. Rare drop 
                is jade reaver. One hour respawn time.</font></p>

                Lord Ghiosk: Very similar to a reaver, just more hitpoints. Common

                such as gravity flux so fight within a building. Spawns from reaver

                way back to the zone. Many people try to use this bug to their

                Ledges: There is a right and left ledge that have two mobs spawn. 
                Out of the way of trains, so a popular spot to camp. Narrow spaces 
                make it bad for fatties (who cannot shrink). If you have a pull 
                you are killing, most likely another group's pull will aggro on 
                you if they bring it near. Please don't pull through a ledge group.

                First pull the ones just inside the door, then pull the ones off 
                the top, then pull the ones deeper inside then lastly pull the 
                ones off the very very top. Be careful wandering the very very

                two at a time. </font></p>

                Middle goo can see through sneak, and is higher level than most 
                goos (up to lvl 47, and yes, does drop spells), but is easy to 
                pull singles. Two wooden houses back here, one with 2 sets of 
                2 randoms, and one with 3 goos, the 3 goo wooden house does not 
                see through sneak. In between the houses is a small gatehouse

                Bridge: Left and right side has 4 spawns, then there are two gazebos 
                with 3 spawns each. Past them is the reaver house, 200 lockpick 
                skill required. Generally reavers are for 2+ groups of 50+. </font></p>

                a wooden lift. Fine steel ulak from captain of the guard or 200 
                lockpick skill required to operate lift. Room with reaver and

                First room of sky level has horrible pathing (mobs cannot reach 
                the hallway, or vice versa) and aggros nearly the entire level. 
                Do not go there unless you need the human skeleton. Instead there 
                is a secret wall to the right with an invisible walkway leading 
                up. Pull mobs from the house on top, down to the hallway, til

                - Bring everyone you can for a raid. The lag gets incredible with

                - Be patient on reaver pulls, many time surrounding mobs need

                Everything before a reaver is incredibly easy and can be handled

                was going ok until the puller (who of course died) was looting 
                corpses and some mobs got on him. We had Ghiosk down to about 
                50% before everyone died. 4 people made it out. Since it took 
                so long to get organized we ending up losing about half our people 
                right there after rezzes. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So 
                we asked around, got a few more people, one a lvl 59 rogue and 
                a lvl 55 or so SK. Man they made a difference. Just two full groups 
                and we kicked some major arse. The high level SK was great a feign 
                pulling the room (Ghiosk was still up, and a new reaver had spawned), 
                he nicely split them up for us. The enchanter decided to sit to 
                close to the wall and aggroed a reaver from up top as well, so 
                we got some incredibly kick arse 15ac +8 int +5 all resists shield 
                with a unique look, that apparently there are only two of on the 
                server. So we kill the lord reaver again and then everyone called 
                it a night. Did 4 full groups today, high 30s to low 50s. It went 
                better than the first try, but not near as good as the one with 
                Montys and Snottigrub (our rogue and SK). We were much more caster 
                heavy, and the reaver seems to be 90% magic resistance, the 51 
                necro could get even his taps through, though I think a few wizard 
                lure spells did a little damage. First time the monk didn't split 
                sucessfully and the entire room came in. We killed the reaver 
                and then died on the lord, but the reaver's death point became 
                the lord's spawn point, meaning the lord never went home. So we 
                easily killed him the next time. Enchanters were mezzing like 
                crazy, but there were just too many extra mobs to pull through. 
                So we gave it another go. This time we said all the casters should 
                concentrate on taking down any extras that come along, since they 
                wasted tons of mana finding out just how resistant the lord was 
                last time. Some wierd aggro thing happened and the reaver came 
                out a bit earlier than expected with 3 extra mobs. Casters did 
                a great job of taking them out and we killed the reaver fairly 
                easily. Then instead of the lord showing up, another reaver was 
                the new spawn. Killed him, but now most of the clerics were down 
                to around 20%. Killed that reaver and finally the lord shows up. 
                Somehow he got on the other side of the ledge (we were pulling 
                to the ledge just off bridge) and started summoning people over 
                there. Backspawn killed us handily, and it would have been close 
                without that. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Tanks 
                are key. We only had about 8 tanks the second day, and I think 
                with just 2 more, we would have done incredibly better. We were 
                fairly successfuly at keeping the damage on the two &quot;real&quot; 
                tanks we had, one warrior and one sk/paladin. The rest were filled 
                in by rogues (CR went really fast) and monks. Two more rogues 
                and things would have been nice. Most of us were on the lower 
                spectrum of the level, and hadn't done many real raids before, 
                which definetly hurt, yesterday was my first real raid. Though 
                our organizer did a great job, many people just didn't know properly 
                what thier roles were or how poorly magic would fare or any of 
                that stuff. It was certainly a blast though. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                far as classes go, I'd try to stick to pet casters as much as 
                possible, wizards for evac and of course the enchanter or two, 
                but if you can't find tanks, fill your numbers with pet casters 
                :) They can clear out the extras without having to give up a tank 
                and thier pets work just fine. We did good with just one cleric 
                per group. We had backup healers that didn't get used too much, 
                as damage never seemed to sit on one spot for very long. Might 
                been because of all the rogues we had though. I think it'd be 
                a good idea to take out the reaver, port out, then come back in 
                to finish off the ghost after you regroup, especially til everyone 
                feels comfortable with the place. Taking out the one isn't really 
                all that hard, but something always seems to go wrong on the ghost. 
                A high level feign puller is priceless. Second day we had a 51 
                monk and we never got a sucessfuly split. The SK didn't even have 
                to try it seemed, he had to work to get the stuff to attack him 
                and then the split was cake since very little actually went for 
                him. Ok, so there is the room with the reaver, outside that room 
                is the bridge leading to him, then there is this pathway leading 
                to the bridge... Looks something like this: with the bridge/pathway 
                basically being a mirror on both sides.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok, 
                so there is the room with the reaver, outside that room is the 
                bridge leading to him, then there is this pathway leading to the 
                bridge. First time we pulled the mobs outside of his room and 
                then attacked him in his room. This went bad because extra mobs 
                got trained onto us. It is better to pull him out aways to fight.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                main problem is getting the reaver alone. Its not too bad to kill 
                him, but killing him, plus the ghost and all the extras that get 
                pulled along is nasty. This is easily solved by pulling him there, 
                killing him, teleporting out, then letting all his buddies go 
                back home. If you're fast you might be able to port out, kill 
                the ghost and then go in and kill his buddies before respawn, 
                (which is something like 30 mins I think), but a mostly low 40s, 
                pickup group, raid was not able to be this fast. Being fast may 
                not be the key to success though, staying alive is kinda a higher 
                priority ;) The aggro problem is, its very easy to aggro the outside 
                walls, which is where the REALLY high level stuff is. When we 
                did this on the right side we ended up pulling some reaver from 
                up there. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Make 
                sure nobody sits too close to those. Can cause INCREDIBLE trains. 
                The second day we had a lvl 51 necro come along. He tried to lifetap 
                the reaver and the ghost, both resisted every time. I believe 
                75% of the lull series got resisted as well, but I cannot confirm 
                that. Corpse recovery into his room was fine. I do not believe 
                the reaver sees through hide, but the goos definetly do. Again, 
                pull outside of his room though and CR is no problem. I hope that 
                makes more sense. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Here's 
                the full spoiler about the Black Reavers. Total of 6 of them are 
                in zone. Common drop is Jade Reaver. Rare drop is Shimmering Partisan. 
                When a Black Reaver dies, another spawn on the spot of his death 
                is triggered. For 3 of the Black Reavers, it is a simple Phantom. 
                For other 3, it is a chance between another Black Reaver and a 
                named ghost. Names of ghosts are Lord Ghiosk - common drop Mace 
                of the Shadowed Soul, rare drop Throneblade of the Ykesha - spawns 
                in throne room. Lord Rak'ashiir - common drop Ornate Rune Blade, 
                rare drop Atramentous Shield - spawns above throne room. Neh'ashiir 
                - common drop Ornate Rune Shield, rare drop Woodsman's Staff, 
                also drops a key to elevator that takes you to Lord Rak'ashiir 
                - spawns in tower that floats above the city. Black Reavers as 
                well as named ghosts are completely immune to magic - only spells 
                that don't check resistanses, like Tashan line, will take effect 
                on them. Everything is behind locked doors (you have to pass 3 
                of them to get to Neh'ashiir if you want to access Rak'ashiir 
                without picking locks - and then you will still need to pick the 
                lock on throne room door) so bring along a rogue. All locks require 
                200 skill to pick, so bards are worthless - they cap too low. 
                Also watch out for pathing on 2nd level of city, it is REALLY 
                bad there. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We 
                faced 14 Reavers before the Lord spawned. When I say that, Black 
                Reavers (BR) spawn right on the corpse of the fallen one immediately. 
                The key to lasting in CoM is many many tanks, clerics, and Mages. 
                We used monk to pull, although Ranger will do fine. Break the 
                spawn, pull the Reaver almost to the Archway headed back out to 
                the Inner Courtyard, watch the walls. Reason being is its MoB 
                free there and you are not worried about repop. Fight the BR/LGhiosk/LRak 
                there, if Rak spawns, back off, let the fire pets tank, and everybody 
                aid the mages with mana, necros, already made mod rods on all 
                players *including tanks*. Clerics keep pets and mages alive. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
                very important thing to remember is the BR have very small aggro 
                radius, so you can have the Rogue open the door, and have the 
                puller pull just the first couple mobs, and only the mobs will 
                come and not the BR. We chain pulled, having the monk FD at the 
                &quot;T&quot; in the bridge, making the tank wait at the lower 
                stairs of the pulling lane (If he waits by the lowered wall by 
                the Gazebo, he will get aggroed). When the mobs are split, the 
                tank runs to the Gazebo to aggro and pull. We split the spawn 
                quickly and efficiently and we had timers going on how long we 
                had, which was plenty of time to pull the BR all the way up to 
                the higher walk of the pulling lane where no MoBs spawn. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One 
                warning about the sky level *3rd floor* and the leading hallways 
                to get up there, they are pathing bugged big time. After you clear 
                the castle bottom, go through the right door and work your way 
                up and to the right, you will eventually come to the corner room 
                that has 6 mobs in it. Clear it and immediately have everybody 
                camp to clear aggro. Then you can pull Human skel to here from 
                the door that leads to the parapets of the castle. If you go back 
                out the door you came that leads back down to the first floor, 
                make an immediate left into the wall, its a fake wall, that is 
                the Mist Walk that leads to Sky Level. Three houses up there. 
                First house is just Goos, go up and bumrush that room. The next 
                house has a BR in it, clear him, pray for no Lord Rak as you have 
                nowhere to avoid his AE. After that is three more BR in the last 
                house, the Monk did make the split, but there needs to be a lot 
                more fire power to clear all the BR up there. </font></p>

                <font color="#FFFFFF">The Plane of Hate is only accessed via wizard-only 
                Alter Plane: Hate spell. Each cast of the spell uses up a reagent 
                called Fuligant Soulstone of Innoruuk. The stone is sold by a 
                vendor in the dark elf clerics guild, in Neriak 3rd Gate. Minimum 
                price for it is 210pp. Rogue can sneak there and buy it while 
                being KOS to DEs - just don't forget to refresh hide (and hide 
                only - do not deactivate sneak) after shopping. Although button 
                stays grey while you shop, your hiding is broken. Level limit 
                on the portal is 46 - if you are 45 or less, you will be left 
                behind. A good map of Plane of Hate is located at <a
        href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/PoH-MASTER.jpg">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/PoH-MASTER.jpg</a> 
                - I recommend that you print it out before heading up to Hate. 
                The map, however, has a few mistakes. South Patrol Route is actually 
                a circle, and the part of it not shown on the map goes from 7, 
                to between 9 and A, then to between S and T, and then on zone 
                wall back to the point which is shown on map. Safest place to 
                pull to is southwest corner - behind house S on the map. No mobs 
                go there on their own. </font></p>

                only). Warning: Cons indifferent, but DOES SEE sneaking rogues.

                Rogue only. Renders as short spear although icon is that of a 
                dirk). Do not go invisible or see rogues. Very low magic resists

                oh god, how do I hate these things... they don't have a whole 
                lot of HP at first glance, but they cast complete heals very fast 
                - especially at each other, and interrupting them is very difficult. 
                More than 3 of them - consider entire force dead (unless you have 
                50+ people). Drop Ethereal Mist armor (that purple cleric stuff) 
                and Prismatic Shields (AC18 +10 SV all, cleric only). Do not see 
                rogues. Look like dark elven guards. <br>

                Claymore (paladin 2HS), Darkmetal Holy Water Sprinkler (paladin 
                1HB) and Trueheart Shield (paladin shield). Undead, ghouls. Do 
                not see rogues. <b><br>
                <font color="#FFFF00">Revultant Rats</font></b> - Warriors, drop 
                Revultant Whip (ranger-only whip, 5/14 and some stats), do deadly 
                poison. Do not see rogues. Giant diseased rats. <b><br>

                (AC25 +5 STA +100 HP, SK only). Do not see rogues. Undead, miniature 
                versions of Dracoliche (dragon skeleton). To me, they resemble 
                winged kangaroo skeletons, especially when they attack. <b><br>
                <font color="#FFFF00">Loathling Liches</font></b> - Wizards, see 
                sneaking rogues, usually drop nothing but sometimes a rod of souls

                - 11/25 1HS, bard only. Evensong - 11/25 1HB, bard only. Kelin's 
                Seven Stringed Lute - bard string instrument. Shield of the Stalwart 
                Seas - AC35 +20 STR +20 STA, effect Ultravision (permanent while 
                worn) shield. Only usable by Erudite Paladins (meant for Deepwater 
                Knights judging by name, but they couldn't restrict Peacekeepers 
                from using it as well). Mempo of Likato - monk-only mask, effect 
                of Ultravision. No other stats. A monk shoulderpiece - I forgot 
                name, as well as stats, but it's pretty damn nice. Not to be confused 
                with Rakusha Cloak - that one comes off Innoruuk. Basoon Haste

              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">All items that drop in Plane of Hate are 
                NO DROP. Respawn rate on Innoruuk is 5 days. Respawn rate on Maestro 
                of Rancor and other static mobs (the ones that spawn in houses) 
                is approximately 12-14 hours. Respawn rate on the wandering mobs 
                is 45 minutes. Wandering mobs have a much lower percentage of 
                armor drops than static mobs, thus, it is important to squeeze 
                as many static mob pulls in the window between wanderers clearing

                in Hate</font></b> </font></h3>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Yes boys and girls, we have a defined and 
                unique role in Plane of Hate! As you have noticed from the mob 
                list, Hate has a mix of living and undead mobs - and us, rogues, 
                are the only ones who can be invisible to both at the same time. 
                Thus, our role in Hate is to scout. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFF00">What to scout 
                for</font></b> - Stuck pets. Most mobs in Hate have pets. Those 
                pets tend to get stuck while their master runs around. If you 
                pull the master of a stuck pet, the pet will most likely find 
                its way to you - but it will being every mob it encounters on 
                its way along. Thus, your primary mission is to watch out for 
                stuck pets. Mob presense/disposition. You are not the puller - 
                monks are. However, it is vital for monks to know what exactly 
                IS around that corner or behind that wall - accurate information 
                about mobs that are up in a house and their placement makes pulling 
                a great deal easier for them. Pulls condition. When one monk has 
                pulled a house out and the second monk is waiting for a single 
                mob to clear so it can be pulled, it is your job to watch over 
                the mobs going back, and inform the monk when the pull is clear. 
                Again, with accurate and complete information pulls can go quickly 
                and efficiently. Trains. Unless everything is going 100% alright, 
                do not engage in fighting - there are enough people in camp to 
                kill mobs without you. Always wander around camp, and if you see 
                several mobs running quickly in camp direction, immediately issue 
                a train call - a few seconds advance warning can save everyone's 
                day. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#FFFF00">Mob locations</font></b> 
                - Southwest corner of map mostly contains Clerics of Innoruuk 
                (houses A, B, C are full of them), as well as some Scorn Banshees, 
                Spite Golems, and the occasionall Kiraikuei. Liches and Revultant 
                Rats exist mostly as wanderers. Southeast corner of map (around 
                portal area) seems to be mostly Ire Ghatsts. Forsaken Revenants 
                and Abhorrents occupy northeast corner of map. Ashenbone Drakes 
                live on the upper level of zone, by Innoruuk (not shown on the 
                map, entered via a ramp in center of zone, marked by 9). Maestro 
                of Rancor sits in the northwest corner of house D, by an organ. 
                He DOES see invis - stay away from him while monks are pulling 
                - but when not aggroed, he always faces the corner, so you can 
                sneak around building as much as you like (provided there are 
                no banshees/liches around). </font></p>
              <h3><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#0000FF">Other Tips</font></b> 
                </font></h3>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Be very, very, very careful. When scouting 
                houses, peek in for a split second, and if you see a banshee/lich, 
                back off immediately - hopefully, it will not aggro. If something 
                does aggro on you, do not run back to camp. Stand and die. You 
                will lose some exp, but you will prevent 30+ other people from 
                losing exp from the resulting train. Mobs do aggro through floors 
                and walls - however, they only do that if you are fighting something 
                behind said wall/floor - a passing by rogue will not cause aggression. 
                In houses C and D, mobs on second floor will not aggro on first 
                floor pulls - but in other, small houses, they will. Houses P 
                and Q cause limited aggression from house D - 2-3 mobs will come, 
                but not the whole place. As the person orchestrating the pulls, 
                keep that in mind. </font></p>

                So I hear ya wanna know about da Plane of Hate. Well, ya come 
                to da right spot. I know da place perty good. I kin tell ya where 
                what is and how best ta get em. Course, everybody has der own 
                ways to go, so depends a lot on who yer with, but after spending 
                almost 4 months nonstop in Hate, I think I know it perty good. 
                Just ask da folks dat know me. So here it is, a guide to da Plane 
                of Hate.</p>
              <p>I'll use the map from Arch Oversees that is all over the net 
                for this tutorial of PoH. It is an excellent map and even has 
                the houses numbers, so it makes it very easy to reference them. 
                Also, I made a few corrections based on some info from other players 
                and will correct as others correct me. Just take this as a guide 
                to scouting because everyone knows a scout HAS to know the area 
                like the back of her hand. </p>
              <p>This is the link for the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/PoH-MASTER.jpg">PoH 
                map</a> I used.</p>
              <p> I broke the Guide into 3 sections... Spawns (mob types and spawn 
                types), Houses (what spawns where), and General (break-in, pulling, 
                general planes rules) because in one big file, it was too big 
                to fit here, or on any other message board for that matter. It 
                should also make it a bit easier to follow.</p>
              <h3 align="center"><b><font color="#0066CC" size="5">Mobs of Hate</font></b></h3>

                - They look like a Dark Elf guard. They have high magic resist, 
                so harder to mez, and they love to complete heal. They also buff 
                the mobs they pass with cleric buffs. Keep them stunned (bash/ 
                slam) while fighting and kill them fast. They drop cleric gear. 
                They do not see rogues or even normal invisible. They have a normal

                Knight - They look like a ghoul and have low magic resist, so 
                easy to mez, but love to HarmTouch, and do it a lot. Undead magic 
                works on them. They drop some Paladin weapons (mace and sword) 
                and a shield, and can also drop the druid shield, though extremely 
                rare. They do not see rogues, but do see normal player invisible 
                (although invis to undead would work). They have a small aggro

                This is the most important target most times. If you get 2, one 
                warrior, usually the backup assist, will keep second one busy 
                while the group kills number 1. It is possible to kill several, 
                but very, very tough, so be careful. They love to cast SoW and 
                other Alacrity on everything close to them. They drop shaman armor 
                including a shield, and a druid shield. They do not see a rogue,

                works well, so usually easy kills. But they will cast the wizard 
                damage shield (the annoying 2 damage spam shield). They drop a

                item from the Planes of Fear, and possibly from Hate. They do 
                not see a rogue, but do see others. They have an extremely small

                but since NPCs do not use BardSong, you could say he's a warrior. 
                He hits a TON and has an ae lifetap on everything in melee range.

                a nice dropable shield. He sees rogues and all normal invis, but

              <p align="center"><b><font color="#0066CC" size="5">Spawn Types</font></b></p>
              <p align="left"> <font color="#0099CC"><b><font color="#00CCCC">Zone-Patrol</font> 
                </b></font>- The first you will see on porting up is the zone-patrol. 
                Zone-patrol is about 4 roaming spawns just to make plane breaking 
                more difficult. They will spawn on the east wall right behind 
                either house 5 or I and walk the east wall S and up into the ceiling. 
                Occasionally, one will stop next to a house to buff the mobs inside 
                and then cut at an angle due SW, which could lead them into the 
                port room itself, but they do not stay there long. However, since 
                they are zone-patrol, they will usually be right beside the port 
                room, so porting up could be a problem. Zone-patrol can be Cleric, 
                Spite, Ire, or Rat, and in that order of appearance. Repop on 
                zone-patrol is the same as static spawns if killed, so about 8 
                hours. If they de-pop themselves, which they do if they make it 
                to the zone-line, then the repop is about 30 minutes or so, but 
                since they walk right by the zone-in, if you set up camp there, 
                you will get them all. They have a less than normal drop rate.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><font color="#00CCCC">Normal Roamers</font></b> 
                - There are 2 patrol routes in Hate, the North and South. The 
                North route is basically just as is drawn on the map, except that 
                the mobs will make a square just north of the Fountain (house 
                8 ) and then head back up the path to the NW end of it. The South 
                route follows the path but where it stops on the south wall, the 
                path actually continues along the south wall until past house 
                T, then turns due north until just past the stairs in the NW corner 
                of house C (beside house Q), turns east and follow N wall of house 
                C to house A, then N around house A and back to meet the end of 
                the drawn route. On both of these route, there can be Lich, Rat, 
                or Ire. And they are both on a 30 minute timer, so be extremely 
                careful. Also, the route can run clockwise or counterclockwise, 
                and the mobs can stop mid route and head back. They like to stop 
                on the S wall beside houses 2, U, and T, near the NW corner of 
                house C, near the opening between A and C, beside house 7, 6, 
                5, 4, 3, and 2, and near the Totem (the black dot between house 
                3 and 5. In-game, is a pillar of faces with flames in their mouths). 
                Be extremely careful with them when near house 2 as they could 
                easily aggro the stuff in house C. The door to C is beside A, 
                so if that happens, everything between C and the zone room will 
                aggro. All the roamers have low drop rates, though the Ires seem 
                to have the pali items rather frequently. But that could just 
                be because there are so many of them.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><font color="#00CCCC">SW Corner</font></b> - 
                The SW corner is the other favorite pull spot (other than the 
                zone-in room). There are 3 semi-static spawns there, and they 
                are 2 clerics and a monk. They are on a 30 minute timer and have 
                very low drop rates. They are here for one reason only... because 
                it was a great pull spot away from most of the roamer path. By 
                being a 30 minute spawn, it makes camping here much more difficult. 
                I still prefer the zone-in room, even though you have to fight 
                with more of the roamer path. </p>
              <p align="left"><b><font color="#00CCCC">Static Spawns</font></b> 
                - The ones in the houses are static spawns, and even they come 
                in two flavors. Some of the houses are huge, so they have fixed 
                spawn points and roamers within the houses. Static Spawns have 
                the highest drop rates and are on about an 8 hour timer. I will 
                cover houses shortly.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><font color="#00CCCC">Boss Mobs</font></b> - 
                This is Maestro and Inny. Maestro spawns in the far NW corner 
                of house D in front of the organ. Inny is in a room upstairs. 
                Maestro is on the same static timer, while Inny is on a 7 day 
                spawn, so usually just after a server repop. If the server is 
                reset, or the zone crashes, all mobs in Hate are depopped. This 
                is to provide a little safety during reentry. When this happens, 
                the timer for the entire zone starts at 0, so 30 minutes later, 
                all the roamers will pop and the SW corner will pop, then about 
                8 more and the statics and Maestro will pop. So, what players 
                do is as soon as the server drops, they head in and setup since 
                they only have to dead with the normal roamers and possibly the 
                zone-patrol. They then ask for a zone repop, which the gm will 
                do as long as it is ONE person that asks, not everyone in the 
                zone.</p>
              <div align="center"><b><font color="#0066CC" size="5">Houses..</font></b><br>

              <p align="left"> <font color="#00CCCC"><b>House 1</b></font> is 
                the zone-in house. In fact, you will zone in almost exactly where 
                the 1 is drawn on the map. There are no spawns in this room, but 
                the zone-patrol will walk right by the E wall (just outside the 
                house). Unless you are in the pull group or told otherwise, STAY 
                AWAY FROM THE DOOR. The pull team cannot get into and out of the 
                room if everyone is crowded in the doorway. And a fight there 
                could aggro the other mobs the puller has. Also, stay away from 
                the N wall for a little while, as it could aggro some of the surrounding 
                areas or the mobs pulled to pull spot. The entrance is on the 
                NW wall facing N (just under the rectangle on the map on the left 
                side of the room... that rectangle is only a hall).<br>

                These do not aggro easily since all have short aggro ranges, so 
                pulling past them is usually okay. The usually do not aggro on 
                break-in, either. The only way the fights or pulls can aggro them 
                is one of the mobs with a large aggro range, then it will trigger 
                them as well. It is best to pull this room early. The entrance

                <br>
                <font color="#00CCCC"><b>House 3</b></font> will always be pulled 
                with the zone-patrol aggro. The mobs from zone-patrol will aggro 
                them, so at break-in, there will be no less than one from zone-patrol 
                and the two from this house. The two in this house are usually 
                an abhorrent and an ire. Entrance is on the W side.<br>

                <font color="#00CCCC"><b>House 5</b></font> has an abhorrent downstairs 
                and an ire or abhorrent upstairs. Upstairs will not aggro from 
                a downstairs pull, but it will if you pull from beyond house 5. 
                If you do not pull upstairs here, it will autopull when you pull 
                past it anyway. Entrance is on the SW side facing W (looking at 
                the door to house 4).<br>

                <font color="#00CCCC"><b>House 6</b></font> has a box and ire 
                upstairs. These will not aggro from pulls around them at all and 
                are usually the only mobs left in the zone after a full clearing. 
                They can be pulled or just left. Pulls from here could aggro the 
                neighboring rev houses, so it is best to leave for a while. Entrance 
                is on the W side.<br>

                All three spots can be abhorrents or ires. Careful here as the 
                S roamers like to stop just outside the door to this house, and 
                the N roamers could stop just to the N of it. Entrance is on the

                as you make a pull from anywhere near it, including the chamber. 
                The abhorrents are safe until you start pulling larger mobs past 
                it. The box may aggro on pulls, but has so short an aggro range 
                it will usually stay there. The entrance is on the SW side facing 
                W. You can see the box in the entrance.<br>
                <br>
                <font color="#00CCCC"><b>House B</b></font> has an abhorrent and 
                monk upstairs and the same downstairs. The downstairs monk will 
                always aggro from any pull nearby, especially the house C pulls. 
                The upstairs and the abhorrent downstairs are usually left for 
                later (especially since there have been so many abhorrents so 
                far). Entrance is on the W side.<br>
                <br>
                <font color="#00CCCC"><b>House C</b></font> is generally called 
                the Chamber or the Cleric House. This is the first goal to be 
                cleared (to prevent wall aggros). The entry is noted on the map 
                (right beside house A). guarding the entrance just inside are 
                two clerics. In the northern hallway (from the entrance to the 
                NE corner), there is a single roamer, but he can be anything on 
                the spawn table. Usually, it is a spite, rev (male or female), 
                lich, monk, or ire, but I have even seen a drake there. Just be 
                careful and look before charging into the room. Mostly, though, 
                it is a spite or rev. In the far SE corner of the house is a throne, 
                and there is a cleric on either side of it. The central hall of 
                house C (between houses B and V) has 2 spawns, and both are roamers. 
                One spawns on the far west end of the hall and roams to the east 
                end. The other spawns on the far east end of the central hall 
                and will roam all the way to the far east wall of the house (close 
                to house 2). These two can also be any mob on the spawn table, 
                but I mostly see rev, spite, ire, or lich on the east one, and 
                rev, lich, ire, spite, or drake on the west one. Be careful as 
                the drakes have a huge aggro range. A drake pull here could aggro 
                a drake upstairs, and that would be very bad. No real way to avoid 
                it, but be careful. The west side of the central hall has 2 clerics 
                guarding the passage (just inside the west side). There are also 
                2 roamers in the west end of the house just below the stairs, 
                and the roam from the stairs to the central hall and back. They 
                can be anything on the table, but I mostly see lich, drake, or 
                spite. Usually, if one roamer is in the corner near the stairs, 
                you can safely pull the other (once the 2 clerics are gone, that 
                is). In the far SW corner of the house, there is another roamer 
                that stays in that corner. I usually see lich or rat there, but 
                have seen others also. It is usually safe to pull from the west 
                end and not get this guy, but he does need to be killed. There 
                is also a back entrance to the Chamber, noted on the map on the 
                W wall just above the SW corner. This is the door to pull through 
                when you camp SW corner.<br>
                <br>
                <font color="#00CCCC"><b>House C</b></font> upstairs has the same 
                floor plan as downstairs. All spots upstairs can be anything on 
                the table. There are two roamers at the top of the stairs (NW 
                corner), one in SW corner, two in the central hall, and four in 
                the East hall. NW stays in NW corner, SW in SW, and the central 
                hall stay there. The ones in the east end will roam from just 
                above the entrance downstairs (near house A) all the way to the 
                SE corner. NW is usually revs, SW a lich, central a monk or ire, 
                and east is usually drake, spite, lich, and rat. But again, anything 
                can be in any spot. It could be all drakes. Of course, that would 
                be very unlucky for most, nice for any sks, but still. ;) In most 
                cases, the upstairs will not aggro from downstairs. However, if 
                there is a drake upstairs and down, they could overlap ranges 
                and cause a chain aggro. Usually, however, upstairs Chamber is 
                left for later pulls.<br>
                <br>
                <font color="#00CCCC"><b>House D</b></font> is the Chapel. There 
                are also a lot of mobs in here, and almost all of them are roamers. 
                Once the Chamber is clear, you should work on the Chapel so you 
                can move camp. The SW corner of the Chapel is generally called 
                the Throne, and it is the next camp site (after Maestro is killed). 
                This is because it avoids most of the S patrol route, and there 
                is a much much better pathing from the rev houses (NE corner) 
                to the Chapel than to the zone-in room. That path does cross the 
                N roamer route, but there are less roamers on the N route than 
                S. Chapel entry is guarded by two clerics. there are also two 
                clerics in the far SW corner beside the throne. The only other 
                static spawns in the Chapel are Maestro and his guards.<br>
                <br>
                The Chapel roamers all have specific roam and pull paths. There 
                is one in the SW (usually monk) corner that stays in that area, 
                one in the corner on the S wall closest to the entry (usually 
                rev), one in the NE corner (usually scorn), and one in the corner 
                of the stairs (NE of the entry) (usually rev). There is another 
                one just S of Maestro (just N of house P) that roams from that 
                corner up to Maestro and back (usually abhorrent). Pull him when 
                on the S end of his route. And in addition to these area roamers, 
                there are about six or eight house roamers that will roam from 
                near the throne area up to near Maestro over to near the stairs. 
                All roamers can be monk, abhorrent, both revs, ire, lich, rat, 
                scorn, or spite. There are specific paths for each, but that is 
                too much to put in this already long tutorial.<br>
                <br>
                The Chapel also has an upstairs, like the Chamber, but it is not 
                a full floor plan. There is a balcony overlooking the organ, so 
                the 2nd floor is cut off from the top of the stairs angled a little 
                S over to above the corner N of house P. At the top of the stairs, 
                there is one roamer, usually a rev or scorn. In the SW corner 
                is one, usually cleric or spite. There is also one in the SE corner, 
                usually rev or lich. All three of these can be anything but drakes.<br>
                <br>
                Maestro floats just in front of his organ in the far NW corner 
                of the house. He will have 4 personal guards, 2 on each side of 
                him. In most cases, he will be facing NW, but will turn to face 
                his guards when they buff him. It is safe to scout up behind him, 
                but if facing you, he will aggro. His guards are always spites 
                or clerics, and can be any mix from all of one, to a mix, or to 
                all of the other. The entire Chapel, upstairs and down, plus some 
                of the surrounding houses must be pulled before he is or he will 
                aggro everything in his path. The best method for pulling him 
                I've seen is for the scout to sit on the far east wall looking 
                out between houses 5 and 6. Make sure you are up the wall a little. 
                The puller hits Maestro and runs to the area in front of that 
                alley and fds. Do not go in the alley or Maestro will be too close 
                to the scout and kill her. The assister would come out to the 
                corner by the totem and wait. When the scouts sees only Maestro 
                above the puller, she will give the word and the assister will 
                shoot Maestro and pull him into the zone room. For this to work 
                takes timing, and the roamers must be clear. The puller must stay 
                down as the guards will probably still be aggroed on him, but 
                they should be back home. If they make it home, and the scout 
                will go there to make sure, then the puller can get up. If they 
                do not come then, the puller is safe to join the fun pounding 
                on Maestro and the scout can go poke some, too. There are a number 
                of tactics to actually kill him once pulled. This is only info 
                on how to pull him. After he is dead, you can safely pull his 
                guards as will any pull to split.<br>
                <br>
                Once this is done, the raid usually moves camp to the Throne area 
                of the Chapel as noted before. The scout will scout the path, 
                and the puller or someone else will lead everyone there. If attacked 
                along the way, do NOT stop and fight. Keep running and take the 
                mob to the Throne. If you fight in the hall, more roamers could 
                spawn on you or you could aggro something not yet pulled. Once 
                camp is reset, the puller and scout can get back to work and pull 
                everything else in the zone.<br>

                For the revs, monks, and scorns, I have been as accurate as possible. 
                So don't count the mobs here and then what you find and say I 
                am wrong. It is nearly impossible for a rogue to get accurate 
                scorn counts since they see us. And the revs are done so seldom 
                that I forget on them. But I think this is almost perfect.<br>
                <br>
                Now, <font color="#00CCCC"><b>Up the ramp to Innoruuk</b></font>... 
                (House 9 on the map)<br>
                <br>
                At the top of the ramp, there are two drakes. They can be pulled 
                without aggroing anything else. Once at the top of the ramp, there 
                are only four doors you can go into. The one on the S side, closest 
                to the ramp is a small house. There is a monk, scorn, abhorrent, 
                or spite upstairs in there.<br>
                <br>
                There are two entries on the east side of the courtyard up there, 
                the S one goes nowhere, the N one has a small house with 2 spawns, 
                usually cleric, rev, monk, or scorn. Careful with this one as 
                it could aggro Innoruuk through the wall (wall is close to the 
                west T at the end of his hall).<br>
                <br>
                The entrance to the N of the area at the top of the ramp is Innoruuk's 
                Hall. The hall goes N, turns right and heads east, then turns 
                south and goes to a T that turns east and west, both of which 
                dead end. There are two static spawns guarding the door. They 
                can be anything but drakes (though not seen a rat there either). 
                Within the hall, everything else, including Innoruuk himself, 
                will roam. Some will roam all the way to the entrance, but only 
                as deep as about half of the east hall going S. Others, including 
                Innoruuk, will roam only to the far NW corner of the Hall, but 
                will go all the way back to the T, and roam between the two ends 
                of the T. The roamers can be anything but drakes and rats. There 
                are also 2 deep roamers back at the T, and they are always drakes.<br>
                <br>
                Be very careful pulling the Hall. Inny will see sneaking. I have 
                never even been able to sneak behind him, though that is probably 
                just my bad luck and he turns around. And he will Death Touch. 
                Every mob in the Hall except the 2 drakes in the back can be pulled 
                without aggroing Inny. You just have to watch for him and get 
                out of his way.<br>
                <br>
                Normal Inny pulling takes four people, the puller, the assister, 
                the scout, and the sacrifice. The scout will check on his location 
                (best to pull him from the NW corner near entrance so as to avoid 
                aggroing the drakes in the back), then get out of the way. The 
                sacrifice will charge and take the DT. The puller will then pull 
                Inny and run for the Throne. If lucky and properly buffed, he 
                can make it back there. If not, the assister grabs Inny and pulls 
                him the rest of the way. Then you fight him. The scout then goes 
                safely into the hall and drags out the body of the sacrifice to 
                be resed. <br>
              </P>
              <div align="center"><font size="5"><b><font color="#0066CC">Break-in...</font></b></font><br>
                <br>
              </div>
              <p> Break-in can be one of 2 methods, and both work well, depending 
                on the skills of the groups. It can be either a rogue in the first 
                group to scout and tell when the zone-patrol has gone be so can 
                get some safety on entry. For this method, everyone must be invisible. 
                As soon as you get in, move the S wall of the room and camp (NOT 
                /q, camp), then meet in a chat room. The scout will still be in 
                and talking to the group. The last group up usually ports up about 
                the same time that the scout has someone (usually someone with 
                2 systems so in chat and on another character in-game, or someone 
                on a twink logs out to chat) tells the folks in chat to log in. 
                Once everyone is in, the fights start.<br>
                <br>
                The other method is 2 good groups head up at once and start fighting. 
                The next groups head up in pairs a few minutes apart (to keep 
                from crashing the zone with too many folks zoning into the same 
                area all at once). This is the much faster method, but is also 
                more dangerous since the mobs in house 3 will aggro any roamers 
                going by, who could aggro the mobs in house C, who could... In 
                any event, either method works well as I have been in on both. 
                I tend to prefer the fighting-break since less time spent, and 
                the aggro mobs in house C are not that frequent.<br>

              <div align="center"><font color="#0066CC" size="5"><b>Pulling...</b></font><br>
                <br>
              </div>
              <p> Pull team consists of a scout (the rogue), puller (fder), assister 
                (warrior), cleric, and 2 others. I prefer the 2 others to be enchanter 
                and another healer. I like an enchanter there so he/she knows 
                what is coming in since he may want to mez the first and hold 
                it to fight the second. I like a backup healer to help keep the 
                assister and chanter alive, and to keep the fder and ME alive. 
                ;) <br>
                <br>
                The scout will do just that... scout. She will tell the fder what 
                mobs are where so as to avoid a lot of fd if possible, especially 
                since the fd change where higher mobs usually do not forget the 
                fder. There are several key vantage points to watch from, but 
                most important until house C is clear is to watch for aggro from 
                there. When the puller pulls, tell him how many and what he has. 
                If he has 4 mobs, that is usually okay, unless it is 4 spites. 
                It is up to you as scout, the puller, and the chanter as to whether 
                to bring in the pull or let some of it get away. Don't worry if 
                you miss some, they will still be there.<br>
                <br>
                The puller pulls mobs. The usual fd spot is in the in corner of 
                the L of house 3 just N of the entry to house 1. As long as the 
                fights are inside house 1, mobs there will usually not aggro. 
                Puller pulls to there and fds. Then the assister, when told to 
                pull, hits one with bow to pull it into the room. If the way is 
                clear behind the puller (what the scout watches for), then the 
                puller gets up and pulls some more. <br>
                <br>
                If there is only 1 mob in the fight room, be it the zone-in room 
                or the SW corner, then there are not enough mobs. A constant pull 
                flow keeps everyone busy and happy. It also clears the path the 
                absolute best spot to pull to in the zone... the Chapel (house 
                D).<br>
                <br>
                Pull order on all of the houses is up to the pull team and leader 
                of the raid. Please do NOT ask that some mob get pulled. If the 
                pull team is a good one, they will try their best to keep a very 
                balanced set of pulls in order to keep everyone happy. Revs are 
                usually the last to be pulled, but if the pull team is good, they 
                can get a few of the rev houses before clearing the Chapel. Houses 
                U and V can also be pulled as soon as house C is clear, which 
                would help keep the bards and warriors happy. Any other pull notes, 
                I have made in the tutorial.<br>
                <br>
                Always use assist. If you start beating on a mezzed target, the 
                enchanters will start yelling and may even cut off your clarity 
                or swift supply. Don't make the dealers mad.<br>
                <br>
                Only the puller and scout have SoW and are in run mode. No one 
                else needs speed. If you use wolf-form, then not much you can 
                do to avoid it. The reason is that some mobs fear, and Maestro 
                could Charm. Either of these things happen while you have SoW 
                going, and you will end up a long way off. If you get feared, 
                you could end up on the NE corner or the NW corner (depending 
                where you are set up). If you get lost out there from fear, don't 
                worry. The scout can find you and take you back. If you are killed, 
                no matter where you are killed, the scout can find you and take 
                you back for a res. If under Maestro or Inny, it might take a 
                few minutes, but she will get you back for a res. Don't worry, 
                no one gets left in Hate. Well, not usually. ;) <br>
                <br>
                Either the main chanter or the scout will call camp. No one else. 
                If they are both dead, it is usually not a good sign anyway. If 
                camp is called, you MUST protect the clerics and help them get 
                out first. If you are a tank and camp while a cleric is being 
                beaten, you will probably be run out of the raid. Clerics can 
                res anyone back up. If all the clerics are dead, it means porting 
                new clerics up to res. Clerics and Enchanters are the two main 
                classes to be protected. None of the mobs in Hate are very hard. 
                In fact, most are rather easy. But only in small numbers or in 
                controllable situations. A lot of mobs with no healing or crowd 
                control, and everyone dies. It's not so much that the deaths hurt 
                since everyone there should be getting a lvl 49 or higher res 
                anyway, but it does break the rhythm of the hunt and add some 
                serious downtime. With a good pull team, there will always be 
                mobs to kill, and everything will be under control... usually. 
                Even with the best team, accidents can happen. If they do, just 
                try again. Don't get discouraged or blame the pull team.<br>
                <br>
                The objective is to have a fun and adventuresome trip. Just remember 
                that, and everything else will fall into place.</p>

                Welcome to the sewers, the pits, one of the best low level places 
                to hang out and rest. Also easily one of the best places to solo. 
                You may not skyrocket in terms of exp here&#133;but, if you are 
                leveling a character and are doing other things&#133;laundry, 
                dishes, writing a novel, spending &quot;quality time&quot; with 
                someone..this is your place. Some of the strangest most awkward 
                things hang out in the sewers, and many a shady character wanders 
                these hollowed halls in search of the diamond lying in the muck.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                sewers are roughly for people levels 1-22 or so. Any exp gleaned 
                above that range probably involves killing major NPC's and arising 
                the anger of a bunch of harm touching shadowknights. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the purposes 
                of what I am discussing here I will reference the following <a href="#qeynos"><b>Map</b></a>.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                are three main entrances&#133;there is a small lake just outside 
                Crow's Tavern in N Queynos, at the bottom lies entrance number 
                one. There is a &quot;secret&quot; hidden wall just outside the 
                main gate, where the royal Klicknak family sometimes spawns, as 
                you are facing the gate hug the wall to the left..it's behind 
                some ivy. And then there is the Shadowknight entrance. (not recommended 
                for good players&#133;but darkies welcome), this is located in 
                the basement of the arena in one of the &quot;gladiator&quot; 
                pens behind a hidden wall. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                are many exits&#133;first all of the above places can be used 
                to exit..plus there are some exit only places. By the cubert spawn 
                there is an exit to the pond by the bank, and there is another 
                exit to the magic user area nearby. To the edge of the map lies 
                the last exit only..which brings you out by the docks. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Some 
                general thing about the sewers:</b></font></p>
              <ol>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Swim, 
                  swim, swim. Don't walk&#133;dive right into the filth&#133;what 
                  you scared of? Getting your dress dirty? This is a great spot 
                  to boost swimming. You will thank yourself in Kedge. But watch 
                  your air.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Many of the bad guys are in pockets, and don't run too fast.

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  DO NOT KILL beggars. Unless you want to get aggroed by them 
                  everytime you come down, AND make the citizenry hate you, and 
                  yes that is the entire city.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Stupid fish. While you are swimming it's amazing how these dumb 
                  buggers act like walls. Just swim over em, unless you want some 
                  sewers fish soup&#133;hmmm yuuum.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Of course&#133;no area effect. Getting the SK guild angry by 
                  accident- not good.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Not much aggroes on you in the sewers&#133;only a couple fish 
                  and sharks. So most can come here with safety to rest.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Many of the monsters here also have short memories. You can 
                  kill smugglers all month..and they never seem to recognize you. 
                  Fools.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                  place is often very rarely full. You will find someplace to 
                  hunt 99 percent of the time, just don't expect help.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Don't count on zoning as a method for escape too often&#133;swimming 
                  is a terrible mode of escape.</font></li>

                  Rogues take note..the large spiders drop poison sacs. Not sure 
                  about the snakes&#133;but think they do too.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  There are all kinds of freaky Npc's down here that seem to have 
                  no value&#133;but when Verant introduces new quests I like to 
                  check em out. Some of them include Riggin Vix, Krynta Darkdagger, 
                  a troll, Thumpy Irontoe, clockwork rat, some named Frockluck 
                  etc. Many of these hang out in the smuggler area. </font></li>

                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  The injured rat area- if you like rats this is your place. Kill 
                  some rats get some earrings&#133;+5hp no big whoop..but at low 
                  levels it can help. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Bloated alligator area- This is kind of a funky looking thing. 
                  This little baby gator scares the heck out of ya with it's roar..but 
                  it's a pushover. Really. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Sewer Sentinels- not good to kill unless you want to be KOS 
                  with guards and gain faction with the bad guys, plus they aren't 
                  easy for their level. I guess these poor guards got the short 
                  straw and are down here&#133;meting out justice in the sewers. 
                  Buy hey Sk's this might not be too bad. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  An exhausted guard- I think he has the same faction as sentinels&#133;so 
                  kind of bad to kill this guy too. </font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Froglocks- 
                  The first of the real interesting spawns. If you want to hint 
                  these..try to get a snare on em..cause they swim fast, fast, 
                  fast. They drop netted armor..good for casters/monks at low 
                  levels. And you do lose faction with Frogluk, so heads up..they 
                  will remember you. Best to have a pal along taking these three 
                  croakers on.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Cubert- Everybody loves cubert. This little bugger spawns on 
                  the red blood splotch on the ground, near the froglucks..on 
                  the cement. He has a few placeholders&#133;a mangy rat, sewer 
                  rat and gelatinous cube. This spot spawns quick, so stay alert. 
                  Cubert sometimes drops a dress. Take the exit closeby out to 
                  the bank and give it to Zamel, who is right by the pond. Note: 
                  you have to have faction with the citizens to do this successfully. 
                  Sometimes you will get a golden ear stud (+3 int) earring. One 
                  of the best little quests in the game, and hence Cubert is often 
                  camped.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Mercenaries- There are three of them and they gang up on ya. 
                  They are also kind of low level, so I usually don't bother to 
                  tustle with these guys. I have heard the faction adjustment 
                  is that females tend to lower &quot;citizens of queynos faction&quot;, 
                  so yet another reason to leave em alone.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Undead knight- This guy drops the limestone ring. Got a placeholder 
                  of a fish I think&#133;.hes a decent spawn to check for exp&#133;has 
                  a dramatic howl and everything. 9) Skeletons- these are the 
                  skeletons outside the Sk guild. Attack them and you are in for 
                  a big surprise. The necros love their little skelly buddies..and 
                  so does their guild. Bad fast nasty death.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Bait masterson/Vin Molitor area- This little maze hold a red 
                  gelatinous cube, a bunch of rats, and Vin Molitor..integral 
                  to the Paw of Oppola quest. This is a good little area for hunting 
                  giant spiders.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Injured brigand- Easily one of the best spots for the causal 
                  player. This guy is good exp for the level he cons, doesn't 
                  draw any other baddies..doesn't remember you..suicides if you 
                  run away (jump in the water). He also has a decent spawntime. 
                  Basically when he pops..get in his face and jump him. If he 
                  starts to wear you down, jump into the river. This guy I have 
                  only seen camped once. He is a perfect low level exp punching 
                  bag.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Drosco 
                  the zombie-This is an integral NPC in two quests. He is the 
                  &quot;pesky zombie&quot; that the necro guild leaders want dead, 
                  and also drops the medallion that Wolten Grafe is looking for 
                  in the temple of Karana. So it's a dual good/evil quest. He's 
                  got a placeholder of a nesting rat and a couple other things, 
                  and is a RARE spawn. Also&#133;it won't say &quot;Drosco&quot; 
                  above his head. He just looks like a normal zombie. This poor 
                  guy was a spy trying to infiltrate the necro guild..this is 
                  what they did to him. He is begging to be put out of his misery. 
                  Accommodate the poor guy.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  Thugs- two people or one twinked soloer can hold this area pretty 
                  well. Excellent grounds for 8-11 abouts. Then you can graduate 
                  to smugglers. They have no memory either&#133;fools.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Smugglers- 
                  In this area there lies three pockets of smugglers. One room 
                  has three, two rooms have two. Fast spawn time, have no agro 
                  memory. A great low teens to mid teens area for exp&#133;these 
                  guys don't run fast if they run at all..and don't get each other 
                  for help. Once in awhile a ring leader spawns which is bout 
                  two- three level higher&#133;then you might need a pal.</font></li>
                <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Shark 
                  Tank- fantastic spot for exp. There is even a trick to holding 
                  it. First off want to mention that a piece for the Ice Comet 
                  rune lies at it's base. For high teens this is the place to 
                  be if you don't mind a semi-slow spawn time, and are a casual 
                  player. The trick: When you face the tank, kill the right shark 
                  first. The other will try to attack but cannot make it..not 
                  sure if it's a bug or not. If you attack the left one&#133;you 
                  are fighting two sharks. After you kill the first shark, you 
                  can take the second at your leisure. Also this is a great spot 
                  to practice throwing weapons if you don't have any help just 
                  sit underwater and fire away (kill the first one though of course).</font></li>
              </ol>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To 
                summarize this isn't the best spot for loot..and it isn't the 
                best for exp even&#133;but for soloing this area cannot be beat 
                at low levels. Most spots you can kill, sit down, talk on the 
                phone, visit, etc and come back in time to get the next one&#133;enjoy.

                Runnyeye is a mid-level dungeon located in Central Antonica populated 
                by the Runnyeye Goblins. There are several valuable items which 
                can be obtained here as well as plenty of experience for rogues 
                in the 20's. Famed items such as the Grotesque Mask, the Blackened 
                Iron Bastard Sword (BIBS), and the Blackened Iron Crown, can all 
                be looted from inside Runnyeye. Additionally, you'll find the 
                popular blackened iron armor (which looks like black chain) on 
                many goblins around level 24 or so. Strangely, however, Runnyeye 
                is not a crowded dungeon. Typically, fewer than 20 people can 
                be found there during peak hours and it is not uncommon to find 
                it totally empty during off hours. Goblins that can be fought 
                here include low level Goblins, Guards, Wizards, and Shaman; tougher 
                Dazed Goblin Miners, Guards and Shaman; and the significantly 
                tougher Goblin Elite Guards. Three named goblins, the Dazed Knight, 
                the Warlord, and the King are what you're here for. Just to keep 
                things interesting, there are several Evil Eyes as well as a named 
                Evil Eye (Borxx) wandering the dungeon. Deep inside Runnyeye you 
                will even find a useable bank! </font></p>

                is located between the Misty Thicket and Gorge of King Xorbb. 
                There is an entrance on each side. From Misty Thicket, head to 
                the center of the west wall and look for a hole in the wall near

                could be the most convenient dungeon in Norrath for good races 
                to adventure in. Rivervale, located just one zone to the east 
                of Misty Thicket, is a short run away and offers a good location 
                to bind, bank, and sell loot. There is a rogue's guild there for 
                training; ample pottery supplies; a pottery wheel and kiln; and 
                anything else your thieving heart could desire. Misty Thicket 
                is also heavily populated with monsters which drops skins (black 
                wolves and bears) and easy poison components (wasp and spider 
                sacs). This makes it even harder for me to understand why Runnyeye 
                is so unpopulated. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Groups</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Like 
                any dungeon over level 15, almost every class needs a strong group 
                to survive. Runnyeye, however, is probably the most group-intensive 
                zone for anyone under level 30. It is the only dungeon where I 
                have found it impossible to solo. I've tried dozens of tactics 
                and have not found a way to pull a lone monster. The goblins are 
                always found in groups of 3-15 and cannot be pulled individually. 
                Rangers and druids can wiggle their fingers all day trying to 
                cast harmonize and it's not going to help. Additionally, Runnyeye 
                has the worst trains I've found in Norrath. The trains here are 
                worse than anything I've seen in Blackburrow, Permafrost, Cazic, 
                Crushbone, Befallen, or Unrest. I have witnessed a 15 goblin train 
                in the King's room that, after being pulled to the zone, had at 
                least 20 goblins. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Fighting</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Runnyeye 
                has 3 main areas for rogues in their 20's to fight. Those areas 
                are known as the Knight's room, the Warlord's room, and the King's 
                room. Additionally, some fighting inevitably occurs at the Gorge 
                Zone. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The 
                Gorge Zone</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Most 
                areas of Runnyeye are accessed from the Gorge zone. The other 
                zone, the Misty Zone is very close but the main Runnyeye areas 
                are all on the west side of the dungeon so this zone sees the 
                most activity. To get to the gorge zone from the Misty Zone, simply 
                hug the right wall. The whole trip might take you 15 seconds. 
                The Gorge zone is normally populated by low level goblins which 
                will not attack anyone over level 12 or so unless you sit down. 
                Remember to hide before you sit and be ready to clear the area 
                for your casters to meditate if necessary. This is also where 
                all the nasty trains will end up. If you must rest at the zone 
                for an extended period, I suggest you move west to the large pool 
                so the trains won't bother you. However, if you are alone and 
                get lucky, you may be able to pull a straggler off a train to 
                solo near the zone. One time, I found the Goblin Warlord wandering 
                around up here alone after a train cleared the dungeon. It's not 
                common, but it happens. The only really dangerous thing about 
                the zone area is the fact that on the other side of the zone, 
                the Gorge side, players are typically fighting minotaurs and muddites. 
                Getting caught with a train on each side can be deadly. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The 
                Knight's room</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                is probably the most heavily camped room in Runnyeye. The Goblin 
                Knight, a rare spawn, always drops the incredible Blackened Iron 
                Bastard Sword (20 damage, 47 delay, 2HSlash). This weapon is not 
                useable by rogues but is a staple for the non-dual wielding melee 
                classes like Shadow Knights and Paladins. Even rangers and warriors, 
                who excel at dual wielding, like to have a BIBS in their pack. 
                It sells on the Povar server for over 500pp. <br>
                The Knight's room is fairly easy to find. From the Gorge zone, 
                descend into the dungeon and down a long ramp until you get to 
                a 4-way intersection with a door straight ahead. Take a right 
                and then your next left. You will see a group of green crystals 
                to your left and a bridge over a small pool on your right. Continue 
                straight into a circular room. This room contains a wheelbarrow 
                and a pile of purple crystals. This is where the knight spawns. 
                It is also one of the tougher areas in Runnyeye to hold because 
                of the huge number of goblins that spawn in and around the room. 
                In the room itself, 5 Dazed Goblin Guards or Shaman will spawn. 
                The Knight, when he spawns, will replace one of these five. Behind 
                the purple crystals is a false wall leading to a small circular 
                room which spawns two Dazed Guards. Behind the green crystals 
                is a similar room which spawns two Dazed Goblin Miners. Just past 
                the Knight's room is an area that spawns 3-5 Dazed Guards or Shaman. 
                Finally, a Dazed Shaman will often spawn near the bridge. It is 
                easy to see how failure to control this area properly could easily 
                result in a 15+ goblins raining on your parade. The key to controlling 
                this room is to control the Shaman. A Dazed Shaman will heal, 
                buff, and even cast Spirit of the Wolf (yes, indoors), on Dazed 
                Guards. Any time a Shaman joins the fight, the entire party should 
                focus all efforts on defeating him as quickly as possible. Another 
                key is to ensure you keep the secret rooms clear. Here is where 
                a rogue excels! By sneak/hiding into the secret room, you can 
                alert your party as to anything in there without causing the goblins 
                to attack. If you forget about the secret rooms, the goblins inside 
                will go aggressive as soon as a battle outside starts. This can 
                easily turn a 6-on-3 battle into a 6-on-7 battle. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
                The Knight himself is a rare spawn who appears in the middle of 
                the group of 5 in the room. Sometimes he appears twice in an hour, 
                sometimes he doesn't show for 6 hours. There are plenty of rumors 
                about how to improve his spawn time but I don't believe any of 
                them. I've heard that he won't spawn when someone is sitting in 
                the room but then had him spawn right on top of me! I've heard 
                he only spawns after an Evil Eye is killed but have seen him appear 
                twice in a row in an otherwise empty dungeon. The bottom line 
                is that it's random. The Knight always drops the BIBS. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The 
                Warlord</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Warlord room is probably the easiest room to control. From the 
                4-way intersection mentioned above, take a left and head down 
                a winding tunnel. It will open up into a square room containing 
                3 Goblin Guards. These are relatively low level (high-teens) goblins 
                who will still be aggressive to players in the low 20's. Most 
                can be easily killed, however, one is usually a caster and can 
                blast a few bubbles of health with a single spell. He also can 
                see through sneak/hide, so be careful when passing through. On 
                the opposite wall is a door which leads to another square room 
                containing two more doors. The right door leads to a tiny square 
                room with a box in one corner. This is the Warlord's room. The 
                Goblin Warlord is a common spawn (20 minutes exactly) and is usually 
                accompanied by 2 or 3 Elite Goblin Guards. He is around level 
                25 and the guards are around level 24. The Warlord drops several 
                nice items at random. His prize loot is the Blackened Iron Crown 
                (AC5, +5 str, +5 all saves). He often drops the BI Medallion (+3 
                int, +3 wis). This item often sells for 30pp but is also good 
                for non-casters to wear when practicing trade skills. The warlord 
                also sometimes drops blackened iron armor. This armor is lower 
                in AC and higher in weight than banded but is often desired because 
                of its black color. Some pieces are more valuable than others. 
                The BI Girdle is AC6 and + 5 stamina. The most desired piece of 
                BI armor, the boots, are heavy and only AC6, but are magic and 
                allow Rangers and Warriors to kick magic creatures. Finally, the 
                Warlord will usually be carrying some sort of fine steel weapon. 
                The Goblin Elite Guards sometimes drop a piece of BI armor also 
                and maybe a bronze weapon or two. <br>
                Controlling the room is pretty easy. First, clear the Goblin Guards 
                from the first room. If the Warlord room is fully spawned, have 
                your party try pulling the entire room to the zone and then killing 
                the Warlord right before zoning. Repeat with each Elite until 
                the room is empty. If you're good, you can space each spawn out 
                so one appears every 5 minutes. At level 27, I soloed the room 
                for an hour after the spawns were spaced this way. Again, remember 
                to keep the guards in front of the room cleared out. If a dazed 
                guard or the warlord gets out of the room when it tries to run, 
                all guards outside will go aggressive. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The 
                King's Room</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                King's room is a tough camp for a group in the 20's. The monsters 
                here are no tougher than the rest in Runnyeye but there are much 
                more of them. Ironically, the problem isn't really with the 5 
                Elite Guards that surround the King. The problem is with the wandering 
                Goblin Guards and Workers that pass through. More on that later. 
                The King's room is found near the Warlord's room. From the Gorge 
                zone, head down the ramp to the 4-way intersection and go left. 
                Continue to the room with 3 Goblin Guards and pass through the 
                only door. You will be in a small room with exits to the right 
                and left. To the right is the warlord's room as described above. 
                To the left is another door. Go through that door and go right 
                then left into a circular room with a smaller circular room in 
                the center. Go around that room and through a door opposite the 
                one you came in through. Proceed past 5 or 6 more guards and open 
                another door that leads to a hallway heading to the left. The 
                door at the end of that hallway opens the King's room. In the 
                King's room spawns the Goblin King and 5 Elite Guards. The King 
                is around level 28 and drops the BI crown, Grotesque Mask, and/or 
                BI medallion. I've had him drop both the crown and mask at the 
                same time. Just past the King's room, through another door, is 
                a large room which spawns 3 elite guards. This usually won't attack 
                into the King's room, but you never know... <br>
                The worst thing about this room is the random, low-level goblin 
                worker that spawns right in the middle of the room and walks out 
                the door. This goblin will go aggressive on anyone under about 
                level 30 and will quickly bring help. This room is where I've 
                seen the largest trains in Norrath. The worker will often bring 
                the 3 elites from the back room, 7-10 guards from the entrance 
                hallway, and a handful of other goblins in the area. Combine this 
                with the regular spawn of the room and it can get nasty fast. 
                Additionally, you are pretty deep in the dungeon at this point 
                and it's a long run to the zone. <br>
                The next problem is the fact that Borxx, a 32nd level Evil Eye, 
                spawns near the King. If you ever see a message saying &quot;Borxx 
                focuses her gaze on you,&quot; it's time to leave. At level 32, 
                she con'd white to me and took 4 bubbles of health with 2 spells. 
                She also double attacks for about 70 each. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Soloing 
                here, as I mentioned earlier, is nearly impossible under level 
                30 and slow over level 30. The Warlord room is probably the best 
                bet for soloing and I use a simple tactic to gain control. First, 
                assuming the room is fully spawned, go into stealth mode BEFORE 
                you approach the door. Once sneaking, open the door and you should 
                see the Warlord and two Elites. Sneak behind the Warlord and poison 
                a dagger. Get ready <br>

                Take a look at tthis map from EQAtlas, as I will be following 
                it for the walk through. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
                you zone in, you will smell all the sulfur from the lava. This 
                shouldn&#146;t be a huge surprise after running through the Lavastorm 
                Mountains. To access the zone, you will have to walk down the

                those difficult CR&#146;s I mentioned earlier. You can take the 
                long way down and around, or you can crouch and walk through the 
                Window. Practice this a few times to get it right, after that 
                you&#146;ll never forget. If you decide to take the long way, 
                down all the stairs, watch out for the swinging axe. If it hits 
                you, it will uncover your hide and sneak! It will also remove 
                you invisibility, if you had a shaman/mage/wizard cast one on 
                you. Contrary to belief, if you walk into the FLAT side of the 
                axe, it will not remove your invisibility/hide. It&#146;s just 
                like if you bumped into a npc. Mobs along the way: one in the 
                window room, one on the landing by the axe and one/two roamers 
                on the stairs.</font></p>

                you&#146;ve made it to the ledge. Looking down at the door, that

                , this hallway leads to the Rug Room (learn that phrase, all low 
                20&#146;s groups should fight/pull to this area) and looking left 
                leads to a few rares and the gnome castle.</font></p>

                low 20&#146;s groups set up in the area above the rug room, where 
                there is a ledge. Pull from the area above 13 and from the pit 
                outside the door. Don&#146;t go through the door yet, you may 
                bite off more then you can chew. Next pull from the area east 
                of the 13. There is a lava bridge and another room, 2 goblins 
                will be by the bridge and 2 will be in the room to the right looking 
                at the bridge. For a group of mid 20&#146;s, get in the pit at 
                13, and pull from the castle gates. Or, head to the Predator and 
                Foreman spawns. There shouldn&#146;t be too many goblins along 
                the way, but have a snarer in the group, runners will kill you 
                all.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok, 
                The Kobold Predator spawns at the top of the stairs either in 
                the hall, or in the room. It will wander back and forth along 
                the hallway. The Predator is around lvl25 and easily doable in 
                a mid 20&#146;s group. In the room, there will be 2 other spawns. 
                It should be easy to clear these and hold the room.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                clearing these spawns, you can pull goblins from the top (the 
                respawns from the way to the Predator room), or you can also camp 
                the Foreman room. There will be 3 spawns in this room also. The 
                Foreman is about lvl26-27 and isn&#146;t too hard for a good group.

                or two will amaze you. Also know the route to the closest zone,

                The goblin castle isn&#146;t too bad, but again runners will kill 
                you. Plane and simple. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                entrance to the goblin castle is at 13 on the map. Chances are 
                that you make have been fighting here earlier. Now you want to 
                move in. There will be about 4-5 goblins at the front gate. Young 
                and Cinders on the closest side and Fire, Flame and Inferno&#146;s 
                on the other. Now after clearing the gate area, turn and head 
                through the left door. Going through the Right door will take 
                you to the King room. Which for a lvl28ish group could cause problems.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Going 
                left and up all the stairs to the door infront of you will lead 
                to the Bar. A great place for a high 20&#146;s group. The Goblin 
                Bartender is the rare in this room. There will be about 3 goblins 
                in the bar. There will be another 2-3 goblins in each of the adjoining 
                rooms. If you can keep the fighting close to the bar, these other 
                room will not join the fighting. But if you have a runner that 
                gets near the door, expect company. The bar inhabitants range 
                from Fire goblins to Infernos. As you enter the bar, the adjoining 
                room to the right also has a rare spawn, the Goblin Drunkard.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Between 
                the Bar and the Shaman room, there are a few rooms that don&#146;t 
                have much but the odd Cinder/Fire/Flame goblin. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To 
                get to the High Shaman Room, leave the bar and go down the stairs 
                and take the first left. If you reach the gate area, you&#146;ve 
                gone too far. Head up the stairs to the door. This next room is 
                a crossroads, clear it and move on quickly. Roamers come through 
                here all the time and medding in this room can be hazardous to 
                your experience bar. Head through the door on the opposite wall 
                from where you came in and head down the hallway. When you get 
                to the bottom of the stairs, there will be a door on the right 
                wall. It will normally contain 1 Inferno goblin. Open the door, 
                and pull him into the hallway. This will give you a few extra 
                seconds if he runs. Ok, now you have the room clear. Use this 
                as a staging room for the High Shaman room, buff up and have the 
                casters med to full. When you leave through the second door in 
                the room, you&#146;ll see a door on the opposite side of the hall 
                as you. If you go down the hall to the right, you&#146;ll end 
                up in a jail area with 2-3 Inferno lvl goblins. This is IMPORTANT. 
                These goblins will assist any goblins that run into the hallway. 
                If you have a runner from the staging room, or the High Shaman 
                Room, expect to see these goblins in short manner.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now, 
                the closest zone is to the left when leaving the staging room. 
                It looks like the hallway stops, but it&#146;s a fake wall. When 
                zone is called everyone should know to head down that way. You&#146;ll 
                need to make 2 successive lefts to get to the zone. Once you zone 
                into SolB, zone back into SolA and med and rest there. Lava Beetles 
                patrol up to the SolA zone line in SolB. But nothing comes down 
                to the SolB zoneline in SolA.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                The outer High Shaman Room isn&#146;t too hard to break. There 
                are 2 spawns in the outer room. Normally at least one is a Solusek 
                lvl goblin (normally a Champion or Priest), and the other is at 
                least an Inferno. DON&#146;T fight NEAR the door in the lower 
                half of the room. There is a chance of aggroing the other room 
                before you&#146;re ready. Try to fight the outer room goblins 
                near the fireplace or at the base of the stairs, and SNARE them 
                BOTH.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                the outer room is cleared med up. As the casters are medding to 
                full, listen to hear Lynada. If you hear her, know that the next 
                battle is going to be very tough. If she&#146;s spawned, heal 
                up and med to full. Have EVERYONE assist the puller, and have 
                the nukers ready to do dump their best DD&#146;s (DOT&#146;s aren&#146;t 
                good enough, you need FAST damage). Taking her down quickly is 
                the key to the battle, the longer she lives, the more likely at 
                least one of the group will die. The healers in the group should 
                be ready to heal anyone, and be ready to stun Lynada or any healers 
                that maybe in the Inner Room. Lynada was moved to spawn infront 
                of the door, she used to spawn across the room. But now, she will 
                be the first one out of the room. Lynada will have a pet, ignore 
                it until she&#146;s dead. After you kill Lynada the rest should 
                be easy. Camping the High Shaman Room is great experience for 
                a lvl30-35 group. But know your roles and know the time to repop. 
                At lvl27 I was in a group with a lvl35 Ranger, lvl34 Paly and 
                a lvl36 Druid. We owned the High Shaman Room for 3 hours without 
                having to zoning. But at lvl28, in a pick up group of a lvl27 
                rogue, lvl32 wizard, lvl28 warrior, lvl35 ranger, lvl32 paly WE 
                were owned because of bad group tactics.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
                going after the King, take the secret passage to his room. The 
                King spawns with 2 other goblins. The goblins in this room will 
                be Solusek goblins. The King is the highest lvl goblin in SolA 
                at lvl35. I&#146;d advise a good group of lvl30&#146;s at least 
                to take this room. If in a pick up group, head to the bar, in 
                a good group you trust head to the King room or High Shaman room. 
                After clearing the king room, head out to the room that looks 
                like an auditorium. There will be 4-6 spawns here, Inferno and 
                Solusek lvl goblins. Once you get these two rooms down and the 
                spawn time spread out, pull from the Torture area, which is 18 
                on the map. The Goblin Torturer is an Inferno lvl goblin and is 
                a solo spawn in his room. But if he runs there are 2 other inferno 
                lvl goblins out in the cells in the hallway that will assist him. 
                Best to pull the goblins in the cells first, or bring the group 
                down to help break up the spawns.</font></p>

                gnomes do not aggro on the goblins and vice versa. The Clockworks 
                and Gnomes generally hit for mid 60&#146;s. Good races should 
                be able to walk freely through the gnome castle, and evil races 
                will have to sneak through. If you want to hunt clockworks and 
                gnomes for exp., don&#146;t expect to be welcome in Ak&#146;anon 
                anytime soon. Not much to say about the CWG&#146;s and Gnomes. 
                Don&#146;t fight the B models around lava, chances are you&#146;ll 
                get pushed into it.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Model CX clockwork carries the Oil Stout for the Burning Rapier. 
                To get to him start at room 6 on the map, and head down the right 
                corridor (the long straight one). Turn left at the t intersection 
                and then take the first right. You&#146;ll hear the ticking of 
                the Clockworks, this is the front entrance to the Gnome Castle. 
                Sneak, or walk past all the gnome and clockworks until you get 
                to the castle gates. After going through the gates, you see a 
                door on the right and a hallway that leads to the left. If you 
                open the door to the right, you&#146;ll see a caster camping Gabbie 
                Mardoddle (room 8 on the map). Ask this person if they have a 
                Clockwork Oil Stout to sell you, or check Marfen the vendor in 
                the next room.. Heading down the hall will take you past a door 
                on the left. This is the room that has Marfen who is a merchant(room 
                9 on the map). He and a clockwork spawn side-by-side facing the 
                door. So, everyone can sneak behind him and buy/sell. Just make 
                sure you refresh your hide/sneak if you have to use it before 
                stepping infront of him.</font></p>

                and are KOS to goblins and clockworks. I&#146;m not sure about 
                a damage shield on the Efreeti. I did feel the need to attack

                Each of these can be sold for a decent profit (Dufrenite sells

                when you get Instill Doubt (magic boots are needed to kick the

                Shard - Proc is 30DD, plus an AC debuffer) - A decent high teens 
                piercer The proc taunts hard, but if you want something to go 
                in the off hand to the Bloodclaw, this would do nicely. </font></p>

                King: Ring of Goblin Lords (AC4, +3Str, +3Int) - Only one less

                52nd Circle Shaman<br>
                Fennin Ro<br>
                Sterling Order of Knights</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First, 
                to hunt in Trakanon (effectively) you need a 6 man team. 1 ranger, 
                1 shaman/enchanter, 1 cleric, and 3 others, tanks or pet classes 
                are best (3 rogues work great). My normal gruop is atleast one 
                ranger, 1 shaman, 1 cleric (won't hunt there without one), 2 rogues, 
                1 warrior. Sometimes the warrior is a 3rd rogue, sometimes a 2nd 
                ranger. Oh, and I have an enchanter slave keeping us aug'd and 
                with clarity, so mana and quickness ain't never a problem...heh.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Your 
                normal fight will be a level 45 frog, the froglok hunter and the 
                froglok forager. They are both up at the same time, and they both 
                spawn &lt;B&gt;instantly&lt;/B&gt; when they die. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Each 
                frog will drop a spectral bow (dunno what it's for, nodrop lore 
                item), and a medalion. Every time. The bow is the same on each 
                (I think, I never really checked come to think about it), but 
                the medalion is different. Hand in a medalion from each frog to 
                Emperor Ganak down south and he rewards you with a key to Sebilis. 
                The medalions are lore, the keys are not. Both are nodrop.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                soon as you kill a hunter or forager, another one should be on 
                your rangers tracking list immediately. If not, one of three things 
                has happened.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1) 
                A rare spawned instead. Grab it and have fun. Rares are level 
                45, 48, 50, or 55. Only Doom is 55. Trakasaur Rex is level 50, 
                as well as Harbinger Jontik (iksar mask). There are 18 rares that 
                I know of, over half of which don't drop anything. About 20% of 
                the rares have the standard naked male human model (reminds me 
                of a monk), which leads me to believe that the zone isn't finished 
                yet or someone forgot about it.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2) 
                Hunter or Forager has spawned out of tracking range. 95% of the 
                time this will be down south towards Emperor Ganak. Tanks can 
                sit down and grab a drink, it could be awhile before your tracker 
                can get ahold of it again.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3) 
                Hunter went bugged. Something happens to the hunter's spawn on 
                a regular basis that causes him and his rares to stop spawning. 
                A GM repop is the only thing that has worked on Fennin Ro to my 
                knowledge to get it back.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Each 
                of the two frogs seems to have his own set of rares. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
                this theory holds, Trakasaur Rex poped off the hunter, and Harbinger 
                (all 5 times we've killed him) has poped off the forager. Hangman 
                I *think* comes off the hunter, but I dunno for sure. We have 
                only gotten him once, and that was last week. I don't remember 
                what we killed before he spawned, I just know we've killed the 
                forager about 1000 times and the hunter maybe a hundred, and we've 
                only seen the hangman once.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Thanks 
                to Gilthana, Bilban, and Kulyen for all the good times and discoveries 
                we've had in Trakanon. It's been a fun as hell zone to explore.

                Guk is, imo, the best 20-30 dungeon in the game. The spawn is 
                _very_ plentiful, most of the froggies are not casters (and the 
                casters are shaman -- and AI controlled shaman aren't the healing 
                nightmares that AI controlled paladins or clerics are, nor the 
                constant DD/AE nightmares that AI controlled wizards are), and 
                it's generally underutilized because groups who are not good groups 
                generally find themselves very dead very quick. Spawn time is

                emphasis. Lots of emphasis. If you don't have a snarer in the 
                party, you will die. Not maybe, not probably, you WILL die. Root 
                isn't enough, you need snare. That means, ranger or druid is required.

                Start with the map on eq'lizer. The good one that's in two parts; 
                it has the lay of the land quite accurately and easy to follow. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Enter 
                Guk, and take a left at the first fork. The right way is where 
                you'll go when you're higher level and want to get to the shin 
                lord room or lower guk, but at 20th, it's too aggressive and has 
                too many green frogs to be worthwhile. A 15th level group might 
                have fun down that way, but at 20th it's zero exp and too many 
                aggros. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Following 
                the left fork, you'll come to a circular bridge-thingy over water. 
                Get on it and take the first ramp off. Turn the corner ahead and 
                you're in a large room (The big room with a J on the top side 
                on the map). Take the upper right exit on the map, and you'll 
                come to a ramp going down. Go down, and you're in another big 
                room. At 18th level, this room is a good base. A couple of tuk 
                knights spawn in the room, and there are some gaz warriors/knights 
                who spawn nearby -- one patrolls up and down the ramp (marked 
                with a 5 on the map), and two are just inside the little alcove 
                (marked with a 6 on the map). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Up 
                the alcove marked 6 is a little tower-thingy. At the top are three 
                frogs, generally two gaz knight level frogs and a third that is 
                either a ton warrior, ton shaman, shin shaman, or the froglok 
                idealist. He drops water breathing potions, and a mask with water 
                breathing charges. Not all that special, but the room is a nice 
                exp fight for a low 20s group (I've still got three or four of 
                his potions in the bank). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
                you go up the plank with a 3 beside it on the map, you'll go through 
                a winding series of rough-hewn walls with lots of tuk knight/gaz 
                warrior level frogs. I'd assume this would be decent exp for the 
                18th level group, as there are plenty of frogs just lined up. 
                At the end of this path, as you can see on the map, it connects 
                back to the circular bridge-thingy, and there's a connected room 
                that has an 8 and two Bs in it; this is the bar. In the bar you'll 
                generally find two gaz knight level frogs and a ton warrior or 
                knight who sometimes spawns as the froglok realist (gee, the idealist 
                sits in his ivory tower, and the realist hangs out in a bar. nice.) 
                Realist drops either a potion of see invisible (ghoul ashes), 
                or a reed ring that's +2 dex +10 hps if memory serves. This is 
                a very poorly placed room, imo, as someone who would get decent 
                exp clearing the frogs immediately outside would have trouble 
                taking down the realist or a ton knight, while someone who could 
                take down the room easily would just be annoyed by the frogs in 
                the way. Plus, the drops aren't all that special anyway. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now, 
                go up the big ramp. That diagonal passageway on the map with a 
                5 at the base; that's actually a fairly long ramp upwards. There's 
                a gaz knight level frog patrolling it, and another frog at the 
                top. At the top there's a little dent in the wall which the map 
                marks with a G; this is where the froglok gaz squire spawns. Now 
                this, gentlerogues, is a spawn that has extremely nice loot for 
                his level. He's only around 18th level, and he drops the collar 
                of undead protection (5 ac, +7 poison +7 disease, 0.2 weight) 
                for his common and the runed bone fork (5/29, +10 magic +10 fire 
                +10 cold, can be put in ranged slot) as his rare. Both exceptional 
                items for the level of the critter that drops them. The medium 
                sized room that is right beyond the squire (with a B and a 7 on 
                the map) is known as the plank room; there are lots of planks 
                in here. Meleers are known to race around on top of them while 
                casters meditate. The frogs that spawn in here are tuk knight/gaz 
                knight level froggies. The next room with the big ladder in it 
                generally spawns at least 2 shaman, usually something like gaz 
                knight, gaz shaman and ton shaman. Another nice exp room for the 
                low 20s group. Brave safe fallers can jump down the ladder to 
                pull two more gaz knights. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
                you go down the ladder and take a left, you'll come to that funky 
                room with lots of exits on the map. Gaz knights, ton warriors 
                here. Another nice place to pull for a 20th level group. You can 
                go from there to the room marked &quot;Possible Lord Room&quot;, 
                but I wouldn't suggest it. Normally, there's a shin knight in 
                each of the alcoves and four shaman sitting there in the pit in 
                the center of the room. It is possible to get the shin knights 
                by themselves, but if someone steps too close to the pits, you 
                pull the shaman down below... another poorly placed room, imo, 
                as any group that it wouldn't be a hassle to take down 4 shaman 
                and a shin knight at the same time most likely would get very 
                little exp for it and not be close enough to a good source of 
                exp to warrant staying there. There is a named that spawns here; 
                the froglok summoner. He's a 28th level magician. Not a nice froggie. 
                Likes his AE spells. Likes to lag your party to a crawl while 
                he and his shaman friends cast all sorts of nasty spells on you. 
                Drops a potion of elemental summoning as his common, I have no 
                clue what his rare is (if anyone knows, please tell me). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Backtrack 
                a bit to the ladder room (circled A in it), leave it and take 
                a right this time. You'll come to a long ledge with a couple of 
                gaz knights on it. If you follow it down, there's a fork. Take 
                the right fork and you'll come to the room on the map that has 
                4 connected subrooms and a G, 6, and L in the center. This is 
                the warden room. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
                here (looking at the room from the perspective of someone who 
                just entered from the path I mentioned) is a raised platform with 
                a gaz knight/ton warrior and ton warrior/shin shaman on top. Behind 
                the platform on the ground is a ton warrior, and to the right 
                of the platform between two of the cells is a ton warrior/ton 
                knight/froglok warden. There's also a gaz knight level frog that 
                patrols in from the other exit of the room. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I'll 
                give special attention to the warden fight as it is such a nice 
                fight for a rogue. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One 
                very important thing to note is that the frogs on the platform 
                will not attack unless you climb up the ladder; you can pull the 
                frogs in the room from right under them and they won't budge. 
                Hence, with careful pulling, you can get the warden along with 
                only one other frog to deal with. The warden is tough, basically 
                as tough as a ton knight. He casts invis on himself as soon as 
                he spawns, so be aware that if the spot seems empty when you enter 
                the room, he may be there. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I've 
                done the warden with a four person group, everyone at 22nd level. 
                It was tough. The same group at 24th level breezed through the 
                room. It is still get XP for the warden all the way to level 35. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                warden, of course, drops two bard/rogue only items: elf hide gloves 
                and troll hide belt. Another case of a monster having an amazing 
                drop for its level. </font></p>

                the damage is MUCH better than humping it back from Freeport. 
                Besides have your team cleric who ressurected outside Guk jsut

                You will need to cross the Plank room of death to get here. You'll 
                know what I mean when you see it, bear left at the first fork 
                in the dungeon to get to this. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Spiders are there mostly for lower level people 12-15 or so, and 
                there is almost always a party in the Giant spider room to try 
                for Chitin Shields and Armor. Past the spiders is your first real 
                challenge, the Scyer room. 20-24 can get xp in here, and when 
                the spawn is sufficiently broken pull from &quot;The sewer room&quot; 
                underneath. The Froglok Scryer will occaisonally spawn here, with 
                a Vis Shaman holding his place </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To 
                get to the area all use rogues want &quot;The Warden Room&quot; 
                you have a few options. I personally feel the best way (least 
                combat and therefore wasted resources) is to go through the Squire 
                area, go down the ladder onto the stone bridge. Jump OFF this 
                bridge into the Funguss patch, kill these. Funguss area generally 
                not that bad, being somewhat fragile. Soldiers will have damage 
                shields and more HP, the worst being Breeders, which are druids, 
                will heal, cast Flame Lick, DD, and Area Effect Rain Spells on 
                your party. Beware the ancient funguss, he is a rare spawn and 
                has VERY high tolerances to magic and is stronger than he looks. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                is actually useful, as you will be pulling from this area to punctuate 
                the warden room spawns, so breaking the spawn isn't a bad thing. 
                From the funguss room, you will have 3 frogs in the hallway, pull 
                these into Funguss room and kill them. You now have a clear route 
                to stab directly into the southern entrance of warden room. If 
                you have a caster have &quot;See Invis&quot; up, as the warden 
                will cast invisibility on himself when he spawns. Otherwise A 
                Shin Knight will most often hold his place. An important note, 
                when you enter the Warden room, the frogs on the raised dias WILL 
                NOT ATTACK YOU. You can fight the 3 or 4 frogs on the ground, 
                rest, then pull them. They will not move unless attacked first. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                you break the spawn, you will have the odd wandering frog, feel 
                free to pull up from the Funguss area, or the front of Shin Lord 
                area. DO NOT PULL FROM INSIDE SHIN LORD AREA, there are Vis and 
                Shin Shaman/Knights/warriors and other frogs which are higher 
                than normal due to their association with the Shin Lord. </font></p>

                  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                  guide is written to be as helpful as possible with ANY group 
                  makeup. The group I go to Kedge with is made of of the following. 
                  Although it's high, you do not need this type of firepower to 
                  control the upper level (except for some exceptions, mentioned 
                  later). 50th Cleric 46th Druid 41st Warrior 37th Druid 35th

                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First 
                  off, before you go to Kedge Keep, go to the Inn that is in East 
                  Commons RIGHT NEXT TO the zone to West Commons and buy a TON 
                  of Fish Scales for your druid/enchanter so that he can cast 
                  Enduring Breath. Bards can also come in handy with their EB 
                  song. You could also get a Rebreather or Aqualung from an Tinkerer 
                  and support their trade. They can be expensive though. Magicians 
                  can also summon Waterstones for underwater breathing and are 
                  great for those times when your Enduring Breath (EB) is fading 
                  during combat (which it shouldn't, more on that later) and you 
                  need to keep alive till your EBer can recast it on you. You 
                  can also purchase Potions of Water Breathing in Halas I believe. 
                  They go for 12pp. Our group got 6 of them and have them hotkeyed 
                  just in case of emergencies. On the subject of underwater combat. 
                  Few things you should be aware of. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Melee 
                  Classes - When hit underwater by these fish, you get pushed 
                  back. At first it's tough to fight underwater, but you'll get 
                  used to it fast. Generally, you want to find something to prop 
                  yourself against so you don't get pushed out of attack range 
                  if the fish swings around and hits you back. It's not nessecery, 
                  but it is helpful. Just past the Pull Zone (on the map below) 
                  right before it opens up into the room is a ledge (you'll see 
                  it when you get there and understand) that you can prop up against 
                  when your puller drags it into the hallway there. You cannot 
                  swim backwards normally. If you duck (D key) you can swim backwards 
                  though! Also if you have SOW cast on you before you go in you 
                  can swim backwards. You will also run low on stamina alot because 
                  of swimming and fighting. Enchanters should have augmentation 
                  on everyone to help with this, and other classes have stamina 
                  regeration spells if need be. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Casters 
                  - Movement back / forth WILL interupt your casting, up down 
                  (without forward or backward movement) will NOT interupt your 
                  casting. Be aware that if a fish hits you, you WILL float backwards 
                  and thus, interupt your casting. It is HIGHLY suggested that 
                  casters stay in the corners, that way if they're hit, they don't 
                  float back and at least have the chance to roll for a continued 
                  casting. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On 
                  Enduring Breath - It is the ENTIRE group's responsibility to 
                  be aware of the time remaining on EB. If someone dies due to 
                  drowning, it's EVERYONE's fault for not keeping on top of it. 
                  Enduring Breath is a 25 minute spell. Have someone in your group 
                  with a stopwatch start timing when the first EB is cast and 
                  let the group know when 20 minutes have elapsed. Recast when 
                  he says the 20 mins are up. Don't wait the full 25 mins, no 
                  need to cut it close. Everyone in the group should be aware 
                  of time remaining. Don't get angry with folks asking &quot;time 
                  on EB&quot; ... they just want to be informed. Casters under 
                  level 35 have the problem of not even being able to tell when 
                  it runs out until they are gulping for air, which is often times 
                  too late to save them.</font></p>

                  Rezzing in Kedge - If you have a death in Kedge, and you have 
                  a Cleric who can Rez, have your Druid or Enchanter ready to 
                  cast Enduring Breath on the newly rezzed player. Also have the 
                  Cleric ready on the heal. Rez sickness wipes any and all buffs

                  - Not too many HPS. They hit hard (60s) and fast (double, triple 
                  hits). Great XP for a mid 30s group. Lancers are 98% of what 
                  you will see on the upper level. They are placeholders for the 
                  ONE Impaler/Fierce Impaler and few Piercers that spawn on this 
                  floor. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Piercers 
                  - Can be nasty. They tended to be more RED then Yellow to me 
                  at 32. I'd say they average in the 34 to 37 levels. They are 
                  pretty much the same as Lancers 'cept they hit for more in the 
                  70s and have a good amount more HPS. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Impalers 
                  - 42 or so creatures. They are VERY nasty. They hit hard (101 
                  was a common theme) and fast (double hit for 101 is fast enough 
                  for me). They also have a LOT of HPS. Do NOT let your casters 
                  get these aggro on them, you'll be minus a caster before you 
                  can do much. Seemed to spawn every half hour instead of one 
                  of the Lancer spawns on the far end of the room from the pull 
                  area. Those spawns are near the ceiling. </font></p>

                  in the 110-20 range. This creature drops the Gloomwater Harpoon 
                  that we all are after. It is a RARE spawn that takes the place 
                  of one of the Impaler spawns. Rare for even a rare spawn. I 
                  suggest that a mid 30 group be VERY careful with the Impaler 
                  and Fierce Impaler. You best have a VERY cohesive group. I'd 
                  venture to say that a upper 30s group could take the Impaler 
                  and Fierce Impaler spawns. The roaming path marked on the map 
                  is where the two flanking lancer spawns will roam. They just 
                  go back and forth. </font></p>

                  Level Tactics - Tactics used in this area were pretty basic. 
                  Basically, be aware that you're prolly going to be pulling multiple 
                  fishies. We had an Enchanter who could Mez or Charm the extras. 
                  Druids can also Charm the fish. This can be vital during fights 
                  down here as these fish are very nasty critters. I highly suggest 
                  and Enchanter in the group. If not, have your Druid Charm an 
                  extra fish if you get in trouble. Beware that when Charm breaks, 
                  the Charmie is going to be VERY angry at your Druid, so beware. 
                  If you have an Enchanter or Shamen, use a SLOWNESS spell. It's 
                  a GREAT spell down there. Make sure to have your casters wait 
                  till the meleers have taken the creature down a bit before nuking 
                  it. Fish and casters do NOT go well together. </font></p>

                  for HIGHER level groups camping the Gloomwater Harpoon - If 
                  the upper room is cleared and you want to pull something, there 
                  are some Fanged Tooth Piranna right when you go down on the 
                  second floor. BEWARE of them. They were BLUE to the level 50 
                  cleric in our group. They hit hard (80s, double attack) and 
                  have A CRAPLOAD of HPS. I'd venture to say they're considerably 
                  nastier than Seafury Cyclopses. Our group (the one outlined 
                  at the begining of this post) could manage 3 of them at a time, 
                  but this was ONLY because of our Enchanter and Druids charming 
                  and Mezing, even then, we found ourselves medding during the 
                  fight and, well, it was prolly the nastiest fight I've witness 
                  in my time in EQ, and I've seen some nasty ones. You WILL pull 
                  more than one from the below level. Be warned, they are VERY 
                  nasty. </font></p>
