<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">deepdiscountdvd is having a good sale. So I'm looking for stuff to buy. Currently on my shopping cart:<br />
<br />
Master Keaton vol. 1-7<br />
Banner of the Stars II vol. 1-3<br />
Risky Safety vol. 1-3<br />
Adventure of the Mini Goddesses (part of Aa! Megami-sama) complete set<br />
Also &quot;From the Earth, to the Moon&quot; but that's not anime :p<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a few more stuff. Need recommendations. Just recommend what you think is good. I'll name some of the more popular stuff I have that people are likely to recommend, even though it's not 30% of my collection, I don't want to tell everything I have, that'd take all day :\<br />
<br />
Escaflowne<br />
Lain<br />
Rurouni Kenshin (+ Samurai X stuff)<br />
Cowboy Bebop (+ Movie)<br />
Hellsing<br />
Captain Herlock<br />
Evangelion<br />
Love Hina (bleh)<br />
Ceres<br />
RahXephon<br />
Someday's Dreamers<br />
FLCL<br />
Abenobashi<br />
Crest of the Stars (+ Banner, Banner II)<br />
Oh my goddess stuff<br />
Grave of the Fireflies<br />
Ghost in the Shell<br />
Everything &quot;Slayers&quot;<br />
Millenium Actress<br />
Everything &quot;Ghibli&quot;<br />
Everything &quot;Tezuka&quot;<br />
Trigun<br />
Gasaraki<br />
Boogiepop Phantom<br />
Berserk<br />
<br />
I believe that's the most popluar stuff I have. I'm doubting there is anything worth getting that I don't have, but I've been suprised before. I'm more interested in older stuff, especially stuff of the &quot;Captain Herlock&quot; universe (I know there's another name for this, I forget it at the moment).<br />
<br />
I don't really know much of anything about that universe, even though I've watched a few series based in it (Galaxy Express 999, Galaxy Railways, I believe are part of it).<br />
<br />
Shoujo stuff are a plus, but I'm almost certain I have everything worth getting in that genre. Well just throw out what you liked and perhaps a summary, and I'll see if anything catches my interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daton Everon</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not a fan of anime, but I am willing to let others opinions sway me if the points are valid.<br />
<br />
Why anime, what makes it great?  What is better about anime than say Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote?<br />
<br />
RR is just an example, there are many cartoons I would say equate to better than the anime I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senn</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Daton, I cannot speak for other people, but here's my logic:<br />
<br />
Anime is not inherently better than any other form of cartoon or live action film. It is just another way to present a story and/or artwork. The stories, art, directing, acting [voice acting] etc, of any film, should be judged on their own merits :)<br />
<br />
That said, I really do like some anime. But some of it is trash :p I could no more say &quot;wow, anime is great!&quot; and mean it than I could say &quot;wow, hollywood films are great!&quot; .... we all know that hollywood spews trash with some gems in it, anime is the same way =p<br />
<br />
... oh, and I have no recommendations for you Stalkyr :) all the ones I really like, you already own!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll say the same thing I've always have. Anime is no different than any other media. It has it's good shows, and it's bad shows. As previously mentioned, it is a different way to present the story.<br />
<br />
What makes it different than road runner, looney tunes? Well, several things. The art style is very different, it may not be different to an ordinary person, but someone who sees enough of it starts catching the differences. It's kinda like being able to tell the difference between uh, Van Gogh (Italian Painter?)'s earlier works and later works. I couldn't tell the difference, but if I was involved in it, I probably could.<br />
<br />
It typically is aimed at a much more mature audience (by American standards, anyway) so the topics discussed are often &quot;adult&quot; topics, for lack of better explainton. What makes this different than anything America has? Well, probably the only thing is the way the story is presented.<br />
<br />
There are things in Anime that make me enjoy it more, namely it's overexaggeration of, well, just about everything. There are a lot of realistic anime, too, of course.  Another thing is, that Anime is able to show things that can only be shown through art. Over the top fight scenes, magic, destruction, etc. Could anyone really make a live action counterpart of Naruto, and One Piece? Is an Anime like PlanetES doable live-action without looking stupid and corny? Last Exile? Full Moon wo Sagashite? I could name hundreds.<br />
<br />
Perhaps so, but past experience says no. Does this have anything to do with it being Japanese? Not much. A lot of anime do not take place in Japan, and therefore do not include Japanese culture (see Monster, for example). It's always interesting learning new things about other cultures, and Japan is a really interesting place. Bunch of weirdoes over there. (I'm joking, kinda).<br />
<br />
Often people talk about Anime as if it was the god of all entertainment. It's not. These people often look through rose colored glasses. It's like someone from another country watching Band of Brothers, From the Earth to the Moon, Simpsons, and Schindlers List and calling us the god of entertainment. That's foolish. We have reality shows. Need I say more? Most (read: not all) anime fans have only seen the popular shows, and talk as if it's everything anime is.<br />
<br />
I guess that about sums it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hikthur</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... let me go get my DVD's *wanders off*<br />
<br />
Alright, Here are a list of things I might reccomend to you,. sorted by over-all category.<br />
<br />
Mecha:<br />
Blue Gender, Gundam (Specifically SEED, MS 08th team), Nadesico<br />
<br />
Strange (Examples: Boogiepop 'n' Lain)<br />
Technolyze, Blame<br />
<br />
Shorts:<br />
&quot;Comedy&quot; &amp;lt;-- A VERY dark short. Amazing, though.<br />
<br />
Movies:<br />
Animation Runner Kuromi (1 + 2)<br />
<br />
Things I don't know how to classify:<br />
Haibane Renmei (Charcoal feather foundation), Initial D, Last Exile<br />
<br />
I suppose... action/dramar/romancy-thingy. I hate classifying, really.<br />
Angelic Layer, <br />
<br />
Takahasi:<br />
Ranma (Ehh, it's funny.) is okay... but IF you can find it, IF, I highly reccomend Rumic Theater, which is a collection of shorts she did. I doubt you can though.<br />
<br />
Action-y:<br />
Yu Yu Hakusho<br />
<br />
Comedy:<br />
Full Metal Panic (And Fumoffu)<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Now, I don't really think most of this will be easy or even possible to find, because you have most of the &quot;easy to get&quot; greats. ;) Nice collection, by the way.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As for why Anime? Personally, I just like watching different art styles. A lot of stuff I have caught my interest with a very distinct style or interesting quirk in how they did things. Also, I find that a drawn medium allows for more.<br />
<br />
Let me explain, Live action is done with real people. Real people can only do so much. Now, special effects, etc. can bolster that, but it doesn't flow as seamlessly. Personally, I prefer high fantasy when I read, but I detest high fantasy movies, because they look terrible (generally.)<br />
<br />
So, why Anime? It's personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like anime beacuse there is a story<br />
<br />
ever watched transformers ? G I joe ? what story spaned more than 5 episode ? not much<br />
<br />
a lot of anime are one big story , while RR is just gags and no realtion what so ever<br />
<br />
japan standered are lower than USA , yeah i wouldn't let an 8 year old watch some of my anime collection , other than harvy birdman i can let my brother watch anything i have in my USA cartoon collection , since he wouldn't question anything in it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have Blue Gender, and Nadesico. Not a fan of Gundam, unfortunately. Also have Technolyze and Blame. By Comedy, if you mean Studio 4C Comedy, I have that. Will check out Animation Runner Kuromi.<br />
<br />
Have Haibane Renemi and Last Exile. Didn't like Initial D when I watched it at my friend's. Have Angelic Layer too. I own the Ranma Manga, so I don't have any motivation to get the anime. I have Rumic Theater and the second season, Mermaid's Forest.<br />
<br />
Already watched Yu Yu Hakusho, at least what's currently availble. Don't have it though, don't feel it's worth the purchasure. My friend collects it so I just borrow from him. Have FMP and Fumoffu.<br />
<br />
:) Good recommendations though. Gonna check out Animation Runner, never heard of that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I will recommend is Gainax's extremely Ghibli-esque tv series Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water.  The whole series is being packaged into 2 perfect collections currently.  Vol 1 (http://www.deepdiscountdvd.com/dvd.cfm?itemID=ADV008582) is currently available and includes the first 5 DVDs and the first 2 soundtracks CDs.  Vol 2 comes out on July 6 and contains the last 6 DVDs and the second 2 soundtrack CDs.  It's a GREAT show, at a GREAT price.<br />
<br />
Yeap, that's my only real recommendation.  Other than that I'm going to list what I ordered under the DDD sale. ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Full Metal Panic 6, 7<br />
Rah Xephon 1, 4,5,6,7<br />
Onegai Teacher 2,3,4<br />
Last Exile 4<br />
Masion Ikkoku Box 3<br />
<br />
<br />
One final note... I like how people are recommending DVDs which aren't even out here yet. ;)<br />
<br />
OH OH one more final note.  The bad word filter filtered out sagashi.te  *chuckle*<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok ok ok one other recommendation but I'm betting I don't have to mention this (really betting I didn't have to mention Nadia either) - Maison Ikkoku.  First three boxed sets available, each with 12 episodes between 3 DVDs.  It's a seinen romance which may well appeal to your shojo fancies.  I take no responsibilty if you hate it though. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think its easier for us and you that you list what you don't have and we just tell you if we saw it or not  :lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Stalkyr, people like you need to make one of those big DVD collection pages with DVD Profiler or something so you can list up what you have. ;)  It's not worth it for me, my DVDs number around only 150ish, I have a feeling yours outnumber mine heheh.<br />
<br />
(though if my VHS anime collection were suddenly DVD... eh, that's wishful thinking though heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hikthur</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh. I just reccomend what I've seen that's good. And yes, I did meen 4c's comedy.<br />
<br />
Kuromi is another Watanabe work, like Excel, but a lot more down to earth. And yes, I agree with Maison and Nadia, though I can't say I've seen much of either.<br />
<br />
Pretty much, I'd have to go into ecclectic stuff or stuff that's not even DVD'd in Japan yet, so, I can just say, I want your DVD's. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha sorry, I know my request is somewhat unreasonable. It'd be difficult to tell everything I've watched, and none of you would want to read through all of it :p but if people are interested, I guess I could, one day do it.<br />
<br />
But Notwen's recommendation is great. I watched Nadia, but I completely forgot about buying it. I must get it now. Gonna get it from DDD! Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
I already have Maison Ikkoku. Enjoyed it. I got a chuckle about sagashi.te too, heh. When I saw Rumic Theater, I was stumped for a second. Was pretty sure it was fansub only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hikthur</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it probably is. A lot of really good , but lesser known works, even by major names, will take ages to get over here, if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as we're talking anime... I was doing some catch up on news from the last few days, and found this (on digitalbits.com) to be very depressing:<br />
<br />
&quot;One other note today - Buena Vista has delayed the second wave of Miyazaki DVDs, which had been slated for release on 8/31 (My Neighbor Totoro, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Porco Rosso). We'll give you the new date as soon as it becomes available.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synrax</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only watch anime here an there but I liked Gungrave and didn't see it mentioned yet.  Watch at least the first two episodes before judging it since the first one alone won't make much sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only watch anime here an there but I liked Gungrave and didn't see it mentioned yet.

<br />
Again, he's looking for things that he can buy in the DDD Sale.  Gungrave is not out on DVD here yet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synrax</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooops didn't know that it wasn't out on DVD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyorg</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Milinium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers are both excellent.  First is a romance.  Second is just a feel-good christmas movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rilasis</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hajime no ippo owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Already plan on getting Hajime no Ippo, one of my favorite anime. Not out yet though. Already have Millenium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vindicor</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't see any sale at DDD...is there a specific list, or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gungrave's not too bad, judging from the first two episodes that I saw at a ecent anime convention.  (Though the dramatic way &quot;Beyond the Grave&quot; is pronounced (Biyoundo Zaa Gureivu)  inspired much silliness on my part)  Yasuhiro Nightow did some work on it, character designs I believe.  Like a lot of series, it doesn't really start the story until the second episode.  <br />
<br />
How about Berserk?  Action-oriented, fairly serious, VERY bloody.  Not always serious, though.  Very intriguing characters.  <br />
<br />
There's the little 2-episode series Puni Puni Poemy, by the same guy who did Excel Saga.  Hilarious and very, very perverted.  Favorite part:  Nabeshin's afro produces several tiny, knife-wielding chibi Nabeshins of death.  <br />
<br />
Mecha: <br />
Blue Gender, Gundam (Specifically SEED, MS 08th team), Nadesico <br />
<br />
Did you seriously just recommend Blue Gender?  :O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hikthur</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmmhmm. He listed a lot of series that go hand in hand with everyone I know who likes blue gender, so blah on you.<br />
<br />
It's not so bad that it's stigmata to reccomend. -_-'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't see any sale at DDD...is there a specific list, or what?<br />
<br />
It's basicly a 20% off all released DVDs sale.  There's a whole list of coupon codes for it.  SUMMERSALE, DVDTALK, DEEPDISCOUNT are a few.  One of the big bargain sites probably has them all listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have Berserk, can't wait for 4+ manga volumes to be licensed, though I already read up to the current chapter in Japan.<br />
<br />
Have Puni Puni Poemy, really funny. Blue Gender was not exceptional, I bought it implusively because I had money to blow :p But it wasn't -bad- either, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">06-20-04, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i still think if you <br />
(all anime list) - (you collection) - ( all anime DVD relase ) = around 10-15 anime people can help you think off  :crazy</div></div><hr />

Six episodes of wholesome ass kickery and babelicious goodness.</div></div><hr />

Bastard! is good, another one I forgot about, thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't wait?  You don't have to.  Volume 4 ships out 7/14, and Volume 5 is scheduled for 10/13. ;)<br />
<br />
Apparently the licensing deal was such that Dark Horse licensed volume 1-3, and had immediately assumable options on the rest if the first 3 did well enough for them.  Or something like that.  However it was set up, they didn't waste time on excersizing those options becuase Berserk did really well for them.</div></div><hr />

 Escaflowne Movie! (omg so much darker and violent, I love it)<br />
<br />
Umm... you have like everything else:P<br />
<br />
I liked OMGoddess!, but mini-goddess... bleh :p  Still, worth a look, mebbe you'll like it. Dif'rent Strokes for Dif'rent folks? :lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">06-21-04, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People have mentioned a lot of good ones.  Ill toss a few more in that I like.<br />
<br />
Bubble Gum Crisis: Futuristic Mecha series.   I think the orignal series is better but &quot;2040&quot; isnt to bad.  The side-series called &quot;A.D. Police&quot; is kind of intresting as well.<br />
<br />
Dirty Pair: About a pair of 'Trouble Shooters' that have all sorts of bad guys to capture. Again i think the orignal series is better than the &quot;Flash&quot; that the came out with.  Lucklly they are rereleasing many of the orignals. <br />
<br />
City Hunter: This is based in tokoy and its about a guy that is a perfect shot and works as a freelance mercenary of sorts.  More of a private investigator/bodyguard usually.  Hes a &quot;Perfect Shot&quot; with his Colt .357 Magnum but he's also a pervert.  Nudity is extreamly rare in the series however, usually his lusty ambitions are stopped before anything in really happens.   There are 4 seasons on DVD available now and several movies.  Theres even a Live Action movie where Jackie Chan plays Ryo Saeba (City Hunter)<br />
<br />
Slayers: Midevil comedy about Lina Inverse, greatest mage in the world.   Some people hate this series but I like it because its funny.  Two (Or was it three, cant remember off the top) Seasons and several &quot;Movies&quot; available.<br />
<br />
Tenchi Muyo: Ok, im going to get flamed for this one. :p  I happen to like it though.<br />
<br />
Dominion Tank Police: Made by Masamune Shirow, Same guy to made Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed. (Also both good movies)<br />
<br />
Saber Marionettes: Shoujo series basiclly.  Action/Drama/Romance kind of thing but rather touching in the overall story.  Three series basiclly. (J, J to X, R) (R is a similar story in a different nation)<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note: If you want I can email you a copy of my Anime Libary.  I basiclly wrote it for myself so I could track all my videos but if someone else wants it I can send them a copy.<br />
Tracks the info on the video as well as a &quot;Description&quot; (Back of box generally) and a graphic for box art.  Have my 1300+ anime videos in it.[/b]</div></div><hr />

Saber Marionettes was SO not aimed at girls. :P</div></div><hr />

IT was the &quot;Romance&quot; angle that made me state it as a Shoujo.  By that time in the posting I was distracted. :p<br />
<br />
I over simplified many of those descriptions just because I didnt want to make a huge post.  In the like sense BGC Isnt really &quot;Mecha&quot; but I can see people putting it into that category because of the Boomers vs. Ladies in Power Armor</div></div><hr />

Well just throw out what you liked and perhaps a summary, and I'll see if anything catches my interest.<br />
<br />
Have you got Shoujo Kakumei/Revolutionary Girl Utena?<br />
Yes, I know it's my pet recommendation, but there is a reason for that. Utena is just that damned good. ;)<br />
<br />
Also, Azumanga Daioh needs to be on your shopping list.</div></div><hr />

The series I kind of liked but the movie I thought was dumb.  I just couldent get into it personally.  I have heard from others that the better of the two was the movie however, in my opinion it was the opposite.<br />
<br />
Then again I also liked the whole series of Armatige III as compared to the shortened Amatige III 'movie'. (The one that is basiclly the 5 tape series crammed into an hour and a half)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzena</div><div class="date">06-21-04, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Utena-the-movie is pretty much a textbook definition of style-over-substance (but it's good style! *points at avatar*). Oddly enough, Utena is about the only manga-derived anime I've seen where the TV series is widely considered to be the definitive version - it had a whole lot of stuff added and changed for the series compared to the manga, that actually improved (in most people's opinions) on the story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's when.<br />
<br />
Didn't know Berserk 4+ already got licensed. That's great. I did not like Neo Ranga. Have Escaflowne and the movie. Have Bubblegum Crisis, don't like Dirty Pair and City Hunter, have all of Slayers, disliked Tenchi Muyo. Will check out Dominion Tank Police. Have Saber Marionettes.<br />
<br />
Already planning on Ghost in the Shell, I liked SAC and am enjoying 2nd GIG atm. But doesn't come out until after the sale, unfortunately. Already have Utena, liked that series. Already collecting Azumanga Daioh, watched it on fansubs a while back and defiently worth the purchasure.<br />
<br />
I disliked Armitage, so never got it. Seemed so.. unoriginal.  But that probably was because I was getting tired of the &quot;machines have a soul&quot; subject at the time I watched it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the recommendations, found a few series that I forgot about / can check out already. Not buying anything definite until the 24th, so I'm still up for recommendations.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
On a side note, I've finally got around to watching my fansubs of Kaleido Star. I am really enjoying it, so I am going to buy the DVD's. For those interested, it's very similar to &quot;Full Moon wo Sagashi.te&quot; which is an anime about a girl who wants to become a singer before a certain thing happens (it gets explained in the first episode, but eh, what the hell, don't want to spoil it).<br />
<br />
Kaleido Star has been very fun to watch. On Episode 8 so far, so hoping the rest are just as good. It's a VERY beautiful anime, visually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Serial Experiments: Lain<br />

Fushigi Yuugi: The Mysterious Play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">06-22-04, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant beleive I didnt mention Lupin IIIrd.  But on the other hand it is a rather &quot;Old&quot; anime so some people dont like it because of that.   All the art is rather simple, but for me that is part of its charm.<br />
<br />
On the topic of Escaflowne, I saw the movie but like Utena and Armatige III I prefered the series.  It may just be a personal preference again but the story just seemed to rushed.  If you liked the movied maybe you could take a look at the whole series.  The movie was basiclly created by editing the series and adding a few new scenes, mostly its editing of the series though.<br />
As for your opinion of Tenchi, just an FYI.  The OAV and the TV Series are different in enough ways that it almost seems like a different show.   If you didnt like it because of the setting however then dont bother with the rest.<br />
<br />
I just started collecting Kaleido Star as well.  Its quite a touching story, makes you laugh, giggle, and cheer at points.<br />
<br />
Ill second Key: The Metal Idol I loved that series when I got it.  (Theres just to much good anime to mention all at once. :p<br />
<br />
If you like midevil you could try Record of Lodoss War Some people have commented that its kind of slow at times but I think it does a decient job at keeping the audience intrested.<br />
<br />
For some other 'classics' you could check out (if you can find them) Black Magic M-66 about a trio of combat androids gone wild.  The tatics and maneuvers in it are quite amazing.  It was of my opnion that it was similar to Ghost in the Shell combat scenes.  They really put a lot of detail into each maneuver performed in the Hand-to-Hand fights.<br />
Appleseed as I had mentioned before is intresting as well.  Focuses more on power armor and such however.<br />
<br />
For another &quot;Touching&quot; anime you could try Tokyo Godfathers Really good one.  Kind of reminded me of a Miracle on 34th street kind of movie.  Definate family watch for christmas even if you arn't an anime fan.<br />
Fruits Basket is kind of intresting as well, His and Her Circumstances was in the same category.  <br />
<br />
Here and There, Now and Then is a sad story about war.  I know some people that couldent watch it all the way through but it really has a message in it.  Beaware however,  Kids get killed, Hints of Rape and later pregnancy,  Loss of famlies, all sorts of atrocities occur.  But people also rise above it all showing the human spirit.<br />
I would say its similar to Grave of Fireflys (Also really good movie but depressing) but 'HaT,NaT' is entirelly fictional, not even based on a real event.  (The modern times boy lead ends up in the distant future war and the female lead is basiclly an alien entity.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-22-04, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have Lain, Metal Idol, and Fushigi.  I love Lupin III :D collect everything related to it.<br />
<br />
I think I mentioned it, but I have both Escaflowne TV and the movie. Disliked both the TV and OAV of Tenchi. Have Record of the Lodoss War, kind of enjoyable, mostly because of the uniqueness. Not many series like it. Have Black Magic and Appleseed. Tokyo Godfathers was great, picked it up the second I saw it. Have Fruits Basket and Kare Kano.<br />
<br />
Here and There, Now and There, is a freaking great show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">06-22-04, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know about Rupan III?  Probably do but just making sure.  Found it once myself while looking for other shows starting with R.<br />
Didnt much like NeoRanga myself either.  Cant put my finger on why though, I can say I like the cover art however. :kroe<br />
<br />
Kiki's Delivery Service is another cute one.  Kidsy show but still rather cute.   Similar to My Neighbor Totaro<br />
<br />
If you like Takahashi's work you could try Urusei Yatsura.  Theres 25+ DVD's of the TV Series and two movies available at the moment.  All of its subbed though. (This is for others. I know you watch them subbed even if they were dubbed anyway. :) ) <br />
I keep wanting to get a copy of Rumic Theatre and the &quot;Mermaid&quot; shows but I cant find them anywhere.  Resorted to ordering a bunch of &quot;Mermaid&quot; manga.  (Forest, Gaze, and Scar)<br />
<br />
<br />
....  Others I keep thinking of have already been mentioned or you already have in your list. (Ya, I added slayers on accident, missed it on the list)</div></div><hr />
