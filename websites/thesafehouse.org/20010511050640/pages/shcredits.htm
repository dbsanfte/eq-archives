                luck would have it, <b>Zato</b> found his way to a new haven for 
                Rogues, known as &quot;The Safehouse&quot; just days (maybe hours) 
                after its incarnation.. but that seems so long ago. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Not 
                long after he established this new community, Remmi the omnipotent, 
                soon realized he needed help. Thus Zato offered his services to 
                handle the guides and whatnot of the new Safehouse Library. As 
                membership swelled, so did the need for more help.. bringing the 
                likes of Kezzek and others into the fold. Zato was thrust into 
                a humbling role with the Safehouse when Remmi decided to pass 
                from the world of Norrath, and bestowed the ownership of this 
                fine community to him. This was many many moons ago, but seems 
                like just yesterday. Still, to this day Zato will tell you &quot;I'm 
                just a simple peanut.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                &quot;real life&quot; Zato is not too much different from his 
                online persona. A programming consultant in Dallas, Texas, he 
                enjoys moving to new clients to tackle new challenges. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Enamored 
                with multi-player games, he has had the great opportunity to beta 
                test and play many of the massively multiplayer games out there. 
                He played a text-based mud (Darkwind) for years, being the guild 
                master for the Necromancer class. Hard to believe given the Necro 
                in EQ, but the Necro on this mud was very much like the early 
                Rogue in EQ - Underpowered, underutilized, and underappreciated. 
                Playing in the alpha, beta and final for Ultima Online, his guild 
                the Brotherhood of Immortals (Atlantic shard), took their place 
                in history as the first guild to place a player owned castle on 
                any server. He moved to the world of Everquest in phase 2 Beta 
                and never looked back. Though he played a Cleric through most 
                of beta, he made a rogue in phase 4 and became obsessed with the 
                class. He loves being something different, not one of the masses... 
                and being one of only 3 Dwarven rogues on the server was quite 
                appealing. Too stubborn to shelve his rogue during the rough times 
                for the class, he grew to be more and more like the bitter stubborn 
                dwarf he played. Still bitter, but with the pride of what he has 
                accomplished despite the challenges, he doesn't see an end to 
                his life in Norrath anytime soon.</font></p>
