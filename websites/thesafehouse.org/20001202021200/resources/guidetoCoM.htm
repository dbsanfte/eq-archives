      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> - Loot is randomly 
        loaded on all mobs (except Lords), so no camping of a named spot. Known 
        drops are:<br>
        <br>
        <i> Skeletons:</i> Wraithbone hammer (most common drop in the city), Kunzar 
        ku'juch. Skeletons will wield their weapons, so its obvious when one has 
        something. <br>
        <i><br>
        Golems:</i> Firerune brand, Sainy's Claw. <br>
        <br>
        Ghosts: Master Wu's Trance sticks, Green Jade Broadsword.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        These are the goodies, but incredibly rare. <i><br>
        <br>
        Goos:</i> Springwood club, Wintry club (incredibly rare). Will very often 
        drop jewelry and gems that sell for a good amount (50-100pp is common). 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">____<br>
        <br>
        Ghosts cast lifetap spells, which do not do very much damage and are mainly 
        an annoyance. Resist magic does not seem to help. <br>
        <br>
        Goos hit very hard for their level. Watch which direction their eyeballs 
        move to find their backside. <br>
        <br>
        Some mobs are level 45+. On a sky level raid it is not uncommon to see 
        a few spells drop. Middle goo in the stone goo house has best chance for 
        spells on ground level.</font></p>

        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>- Reavers:</i> 
        Level 50-52. 99% magic resistance, lure series from melee range seems 
        to be only effective spell against them. Proc blind spell which (as far 
        as I've seen) cannot be cured. When dead spawn a new reaver, a lord or 
        nothing. Not uncommon to see 5 or more reavers spawn in a row before lord 
        spawns. When first mob is dead, any mob that spawns after that will stay 
        in the area for at least 76 hours. If too many reavers have spawned and 
        healers OOM, zone or port out and try again, the reaver or lord will still 
        be there. Be aware that reavers summon, so running to zone is difficult, 
        but its better than a full party whipe out. Rare drop is jade reaver. 
        One hour respawn time.<i><br>
        <br>
        - Lord Ghiosk:</i> Very similar to a reaver, just more hitpoints. Common 
        drop is mace of shadowed souls, rare is throneblade of the ykesha and 
        a shadowknight only shield.<br>
        </font><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        - Lord Rak'Ashiir:</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Not kill on sight, so do not fight until group is ready. Casts 2400 damage 
        AoE DoT which only fire elementals can resist. Use fire elementals to 
        take him down. <br>
        <i> <br>
        - Lord Nak'Ashiir:</i> Not kill on sight, so do not fight until group 
        is ready. 99% magic resistance similar to reavers. Casts spells, such 
        as gravity flux so fight within a building. Spawns from reaver in last 
        tower in sky. Common drop runed ornate shield, rare drop torch of elements 
        (used in magician epic quest). <br>
        <i> <br>
        - Human Skeleton:</i> Spawns in sky level. Needs to be charmed for wizard 
        concussion spell quest. <br>
        <i> <br>
        - Wraith of Jaxion:</i> Rare Spawns in Nak'Ashiir's tower. Needs to be 
        charmed for enchanter epic quest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0000FF"><b> 
        <font size="3">Areas</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i> - Lantern:</i> 
        This is right before the bridge into the main city. There is a pathing 
        bug making it difficult for mobs to follow all the way back to the zone. 
        Many people try to use this bug to their advantage and so this is can 
        be a dangerous area to be in if people are not fast to run to zone. <br>
        <i> <br>
        - Ledges:</i> There is a right and left ledge that have two mobs spawn. 
        Out of the way of trains, so a popular spot to camp. Narrow spaces make 
        it bad for fatties (who cannot shrink). If you have a pull you are killing, 
        most likely another group's pull will aggro on you if they bring it near. 
        Please don't pull through a ledge group. <br>
        <br>
        <i>- Temple:</i> To the right side is small temple with a good number 
        of spawns. A full 45+ group can have difficulty killing them all. First 
        pull the ones just inside the door, then pull the ones off the top, then 
        pull the ones deeper inside then lastly pull the ones off the very very 
        top. Be careful wandering the very very top as it is easy to aggro the 
        sky level. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>- Courtyard:</i> 
        Three spawns to the right side, three spawns to the left side. Use harmony 
        to pull them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>- Houses:</i> To 
        the left, opposite the temple are a series of houses. Use sneak and move 
        along the sides of them to pull out the inhabitants two at a time. <br>
        <br>
        <i> - Goo House:</i> Past the courtyard is a stone house with 3 goos inside. 
        Middle goo can see through sneak, and is higher level than most goos (up 
        to lvl 47, and yes, does drop spells), but is easy to pull singles. Two 
        wooden houses back here, one with 2 sets of 2 randoms, and one with 3 
        goos, the 3 goo wooden house does not see through sneak. In between the 
        houses is a small gatehouse with two high level spawns. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>- Bridge:</i> Left 
        and right side has 4 spawns, then there are two gazebos with 3 spawns 
        each. Past them is the reaver house, 200 lockpick skill required. Generally 
        reavers are for 2+ groups of 50+. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>- Reaver:</i> 200 
        lockpick skill required to open the door. Six spawns in his room plus 
        the reaver. Behind main room is a hallway with a wooden lift. Fine steel 
        ulak from captain of the guard or 200 lockpick skill required to operate 
        lift. Room with reaver and 3 guards at top. Behind reaver is 3 reavers 
        and single guard. <br>
        <br>
        <i> - Sky Level:</i> Lots of tougher stuff, as well as more reavers up 
        here. First room of sky level has horrible pathing (mobs cannot reach 
        the hallway, or vice versa) and aggros nearly the entire level. Do not 
        go there unless you need the human skeleton. Instead there is a secret 
        wall to the right with an invisible walkway leading up. Pull mobs from 
        the house on top, down to the hallway, til house is cleared then head 
        up. Nek'Ashiir's tower is up the pathway. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0000FF"><b><font size="3">Travel</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Loc p300, n2000 
        in Emerald Jungle <br>
        - Fastest way there is a port to Dreadlands, run to Karnors then evac 
        to emerald jungle. - Binding inside can be dangerous as there are trains 
        that sometimes hit the zone line and can cause you to die a few times. 
        Casters are better off binding in emerald jungle, but for melee the risk 
        of binding inside seems worth it. <br>
        <br>
        <b><font color="#0000FF"> <font size="3">Do not</font></font></b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Sit close to walls, 
        it is very easy to aggro the sky level and pull a big nasty train. <br>
        - Cast harmony on mobs close to walls, it aggros the sky level and pulls 
        a big nasty train. <br>
        - Hang around on the top top level of the temple visible, it aggros the 
        sky level and in comes a big nasty train. <br>
        - Go for equipment. It is very rare, in my experience, 1 in 1000 mobs 
        at least. CoM is for xp. I know of a monk that was here from lvl 48 to 
        51 before she got both her Wu sticks. <br>
        - Try to use the pathing bug at the lantern. Its a big hassle to other 
        groups and makes you incredibly lame. <br>
        - Bring everyone you can for a raid. The lag gets incredible with more 
        than four groups, especially in sky level. If you can have two strong 
        groups, only bring them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Do</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Run IMMEDIATELY 
        if some random mob shows up that nobody pulled. 9 times out of 10 you 
        somehow aggroed the sky level and his friends are coming quickly. This 
        happens most commonly on the right side of the stone goo house. <br>
        - Be patient on reaver pulls, many time surrounding mobs need to me mesmerized 
        and tactics need to be explained to certain people. Everything before 
        a reaver is incredibly easy and can be handled without any deaths, but 
        once you get to a reaver I've seen a surprisingly large number of people 
        die. </font></p>
