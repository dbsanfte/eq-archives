<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tabbran</div><div class="date">10-12-03, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, today was my cousin's wedding.  He's more like my older brother than my cousin, and my parents love him like he was one of their sons, so we have the wedding and reception and everything in our house.<br />
<br />
It's a beautiful ceremony, reception is fun, there's probably a hundred people on the premesis at any point in time, cars up and down the street, and naturally alcohol flowing like Prohibition is tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Now, brings us to the subject at hand.  I duck away and decide to play some Viewtiful Joe in my room, minding my own business, everything's goin' on outside.  When all the sudden one of my younger brother's (obviously inebreated) friends walks in my room, goes onto my bed, and passes right out.  It's not like she couldn't see me, I was playing video games right there.  I said &quot;Hi&quot; and she smiled at me, like this was perfectly natural, and then collapsed.<br />
<br />
WHAT THE HELL?<br />
<br />
I puzzle at this for a moment, I mean, it was the most alien and foreign concept I've ever experienced.  I don't know about you all, but if I'm so retardedly drunk, I don't go into random WELL LIT rooms in houses with PEOPLE IN THEM to pass out. This disturbs me so much, I have to pause Joe action and go find someone to get this stupid bitch out of MY FRIGGIN BED.<br />
<br />
Finding her boyfriend, or whatever, I still don't know who she is, nor care.  He gathers her up, she can't even stand now.  We drag her out and into my brother's room, let him deal with it when she hacks.  If she did it in my bed, I woulda smacked the taste outta her mouth.<br />
<br />
Anyway.<br />
<br />
WHAT THE HELL?<br />
<br />
And before anyone makes some joke about not looking gift horses in the mouth, I wanted no part of it.  None.<br />
<br />
Productive night, though, I beat two Joe bosses. Safehouse Minority Terror Squad Commander</div></div><hr />

If you break his axe, he'll make napalm come from the ceiling which sucks.  So you gotta make sure he just charges.<br />
<br />
Next was a shark guy, who was a pushover, cause he takes a whole ton of damage whenever you hit him when he's panting.  I died on the submarine level, so I stopped playing for the night (I was tired, too).<br />
<br />
I couldn't have rolled her out of my bed, because next to it is where I keep all my dvd's, and that woulda damaged them, and if they got damaged -- let's just say it probably isn't &quot;socially acceptable&quot; to say what woulda happened.<br />

As for you Cala, who are you supposed to be?  Do you even know my characters name?  I'd wager you don't.  And I think I'd remember talking to someone who just places random english words together.<br />
<br />
The more I read what your trying to say actually, the more it looks like whoever you got to teach you english played some cruel joke on you and tought you the wrong words for the wrong meanings.  It appears like this because you seem to spell everything correctly(bravo by the way)but the words your saying make no sense when you string them into sentences.<br />

I think it more likely though that your just a troll who thinks its funny to not make any sense.  In which case, congradulations, you hooked me. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot; <br />

She pulled out her cell phone to make a call from the bed, but was too bombed out of her mind to even do that, and dropped the phone.  She thankfully didn't vomit in the place where I want to sleep, but that isn't the point.<br />
<br />
She shouldn't have been in my room to begin with.  The doors were closed, and I was the only one in my room (hence, it being my room).  It's not like my bed is near the door, it's a fairly decent obstacle course to get there.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is that I did not want some girl I did not know to be in my bed without an invitation.  Inviting yourself, regardless of how drunk one may be, does not shine favorably upon you.<br />

She wasn't my type, but she wasn't exactly physically unattractive, what made me repulsed by her was her entire attitude, and the fact that she looked like she was going to throw up.  I don't like vomit, I'm a sympathetic vomiter, my body doesn't think vomit should be alone.  If she threw up, I woulda threw up with her, and then I would be angry, and my night woulda been ruined, not to mention my bed would have vomit on it.<br />

I doubt I woulda seriously hit her, I probably wouldn't have been all that gentle in getting her the hell out of my room, though.</div></div><hr />

Looks, attitude, doesn't mean a damn thing when you are @#%$ faced unless you are some date raping turd. Fall down drunk is fall down drunk.

<br />
&quot;She must have been unattractive for you to get so upset&quot;.<br />
<br />
Divine, fugly, celestial, bestial, you get the same treatment regardless of your appearance if you just stumble into someone else's room, crash in their bed, without knowing them, without asking them. Getting special treatment for being attractive(and being @#%$ faced, which makes you look like a....yeah) is lame. Stupid girls should be treated like stupid girls.

Trust me, nor are you hers from what she told me.<br />
Her attitude? Maybe talking to her outside the bed woulda helped and giving more directions. She did throw up. But hey, she's a sympathethic vomiter too, one who was scared more though, for words are nothing after all. And to get in one's mind, body, or soul like Joe did, was pretty much repulsing when the girl had bad experiences with warriors like you.<br />

Being someone who doesn't drink, I'm not around drunk people that much. I guess I wouldn't mind if a reasonably attractive person decided to come in my room while I was EQ'ing and crash on the bed. It's kind of peaceful to watch people sleep. You can call me odd, maybe even creepy for that, but not a &quot;rapist&quot; Your Sister in Arms,<br />

Calabee isn't a AI bot. He used to be a well liked and respected player on The Nameless before server moving with Crimson Tempest to MS. <br />
<br />
Something has happened to him IRL. Drugs, mental illness or maybe a alien abduction. No one seems to know and it's impossible to get any kind of answer out of him that makes any sense.<br />
<br />
He rambled so much on the Nameless Tavern, that not only was he banned, but most of his posts have been removed. If you troll MS board, you might find more of them there. Just make sure to take a bottle of aspirin before you start reading them. You'll need it.<br />

First of all -- any guy that talks about hitting a girl , deserves to get his ass kicked, thats not cool &gt;.&amp;lt;<br />
<br />
Second of all... Calling her a bitch and stupid gives me the impression there is no way you can have a gf..Thats not how you treat a girl,even if she is drunk. So maybe thats what your bitter about? Instead of being at the party having a good time your in your room playing vidio games.<br />
<br />
Third of all - Learn how to handle things like a man. <br />
<br />
If the girl is in your bed drunk, and you dont want her there. Go find someone like you did , and ask them to take her home , put her to bed ect... You dont have to be swearing about it and getting all upset. being polite gets things done alot faster. And they dont make you sound like a 14yr boy that has never kissed a girl... Let alone.. had one in your bed.... OMG drunk girl in my bed.....&gt;.&amp;lt;<br />
<br />
A real man would have set the game down and  made sure she was ok. he would  have understood she was just drunk and let things be at that. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fhiire</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt misread it. <br />
<br />
In his rant she is called a bitch and stupid.<br />
<br />
And I didnt mean that he didnt go get some one to get her. He did. My point was that it wasnt to help her, or to be a nice guy but to &quot;get this stupid bitch out of MY FRIGGIN BED.&quot; I was talking about his attitude about it. Sry that part was a miscommunication on my part.<br />
<br />
Feel free to think, as you will about his rant. I just dont find it very humorous for a guy to talk about how he wants to  smack some girl in the face, cause she is sleeping in his bed.<br />

As far as calab goes, I think he's a result of either brain damage or drugs.</div></div><hr />

There are probably groups of people in your life that think you are some kind of MASKED MURDERER cause you've said you'd like to kill someone, for pissing you off.</div></div><hr />

Man, you would not believe how many PETA people I had to wall up in the basement after I carried out my threat to stuff live weasels up the various orifices of people I disliked. After the last time I disembowled that guy who was talking on the cell phone in the movies I had such a mess on my hands too. I probably shouldn't have used the spork to do it - that always ends up a mess.</div></div><hr />

the implication, of course, being that there is some correlation between being nice and getting women.  priceless ... I thought the human race had collectively moved on and come to understand that this is a fairy tale   Veda Kai'Rin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone that passes out, drunk, on a total stranger's bed in an unfamiliar house is probably not that intelligent. Hence, 'stupid.' She's also not that well-mannered, see 'bitch' or 'Fhiire.' I find Tabbran's use of 'stupid bitch' to fit the situation perfectly. Also, violence against women is a time-honored tradition, but only when it's funny.<br />
<br />
In conclusion: It gets off the bed or IT GETS THE HOSE AGAIN.</div></div><hr />

Mind you this someone was an incoherently intoxicated girl whose as I claimed I could kick, I stood a chance!<br />

Yeah, no joke -- it was a wedding, meaning there was way too much of this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And not nearly enough of this:<br />
