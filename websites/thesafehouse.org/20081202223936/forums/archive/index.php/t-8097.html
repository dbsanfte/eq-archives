<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bayler</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just finished my quest for the Grandmaster Assassin's Seal.  Finally, I can make multi-dose poisons.  Yay!<br />
<br />
However, I'm very displeased that this item is a light source.  Yeah, the particle effect is nice.  But the fact of the matter is that lightsources create a halo of light around you, whether you're hidden or not, thus revealing your location.  It bothers me from a roleplay point of view, as well as from a practical one.  It would *really* bother me if I were on a PvP server. <br />
<br />
I've been keeping my GM Vial in my ranged slot most of the time lately, for the stats.  If I don't need throwing/archery, and don't need the slot for resists, the strength and dex are nice to have in combat.  And I've enjoyed the freedom of not having to swap in gear for charisma any more, every time I deal with a merchant.  <br />
<br />
I really don't want to have to remake my GMAV and bank my Seal.  I like having it as a mark of my accomplishment, as well as for the stat benefits.  But for me, the lightsource effect is too big of a sacrifice; I won't keep it equipped except when I need it, while the lightsource remains.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else bothered by this?  If so, please speak up.  Perhaps the people at Verant will be willing to change it, if enough people feel the same as I.  After all, Verant listened when we asked to have the lightsource effect removed from the Burning Rapier, a long long time ago. Bayler - 59th rank Swashbuckler - Xev<br />

It's SOO nice to finally have a real lightsource that actually lights up the surroundings.<br />
If you don't want it, you can always unequip it.<br />

Seriously, I can see where in PvP and in RP this would be a bad thing. I know when I was tracking Shardwurm Biles in GD, I would just log in at night and see the moving glow across the zone to chase down my prey.<br />

So do I!!!! I want to look like a Crystal Gargoyle.  Been thinking that there should be a rogue armor or item that does that for years.   Would have been neat if other players see us that way when we use our new Uber Planes of Power super hide. (or dont see us at all! :-) )<br />

How RP is that, that when we hide all that happens is we get go from Patofnaud to (Patofnaud)?<br />

Also for a lightsource, I wear a froggy crown and cast ultravision on self from Myrlokars Helm. Most places are very bright to me, and even PoN with full clip out I can see to the horizon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it doesn't bother my that it is one from a roleplaying standpoind because, unlike the burning rapier, I can keep it in a bag if I feel like being all &quot;dark and shadowy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Though to be fair, I always thought light sources you carry should go out when you are invisable or hidden. Edited by: Ravenwinged Angel at: 10/29/02 3:46:25 pm</div></div><hr />

I've never seen another item with this many candlewatts.<br />
And I actually used it during the nightcycle in PoDisease.  Sure I've got heat vision, but the dirty orange color of that plane (or part of it) almost nulifies that.<br />
