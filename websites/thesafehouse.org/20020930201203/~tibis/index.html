<P><FONT face=Arial>You may wish to use some publishing tools to create

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>There are a variety of ways to create content. The 
easiest way is to use a Web content publishing tool such as <A 
href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia Dreamweaver,</A> <A 
href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia Fireworks</A> or a variety of other free 
publishing tools that you can find on the internet. Other tools that are 
helpful include graphical editing tools such as <A 
href="http://www.jasc.com/">Paintshop Pro</A> and even more dynamic content 
generators like <A href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia's Flash</A>. You 
may also wish to edit your contents yourself by using a text editor and learning 
HTML. Here are some pointers to learning HTML</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT face=Arial>2<A name=2>. Publish your content</A></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Once you've finished your page/site, you'll need to 
upload it to your web server. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) allows a person to 
transfer files between two computers, generally connected via the Internet. You 
can either FTP your files via the command line (i.e. DOS), or you can find 
yourself an FTP client which executes all the commands in a drag-and-drop 
interface. We would highly recommend the latter to beginners and experts alike. 
FTP clients make the publishing process simple.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>FTP Basics</B><BR> To FTP, you will need to know 
the host location (i.e. www.ensim.com), as well as your username and password. 
All your web site contents are stored in <I>/home/<username>/public_html.</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Using an FTP Client</B><BR>Most FTP clients have the same basic layout, functionality, and price. Choosing one is simply a matter of personal preference. Some of the more popular clients for Windows-based computers include <A href="http://www.ipswitch.com/">WS_FTP</A>, <A href="http://www.cuteftp.com/">CuteFTP</A>, and <A href="http://www.bpftp.com/">BulletProof FTP</A> and for Macintosh computers include <A href="http://fetchsoftworks.com/">Fetch</a>, and <A href="http://www.stairways.com/">Interarchy</a>. All clients come with 
documentation, and it shouldn't take you long to figure out how to get started. 
But here are a few basics:</FONT> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>There will be some kind of "Site Manager" feature 
which will store all your FTP locations and their corresponding login 
information. Once you enter this info, the client will automatically log you 
in.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>There will be three screens. One representing your 
local machine, one representing the remote host, and one which shows the files 
that are queued for transfer. You will need to navigate to the correct folders 
on both your local machine and the host machine.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>You will then highlight the files you wish to upload 
on your local machine, and there should be a button at the top that queues the 
files for upload. The upload might execute immediately, or you might have to hit 
a "Go" button first.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>That's it! Your files are uploaded! You should now 
be able to go to your URL and view the page.</FONT> </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=3><FONT face=Arial>3. Publicize Your Site</FONT></A></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Search Engines and Internet 
Catalogs</B><BR>Probably the most common way to publicize your site and generate 
traffic is to submit it to search engines (i.e. Google) and internet catalogs 
(i.e. Yahoo!). Most of these sites have a form you can fill out to submit your 
site. To save yourself some time, you can try a service that submits your site 
to multiple search engines and internet catalogs by filling out just one form. 
There are many of these services out there, such as <A 
href="http://www.submit-it.com/" target=_blank>www.submit-it.com</A>. By adding 
meta tags to your site, you can increase the relevancy of your pages in people's 
searches. Meta tags will be discussed a bit later.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Reciprocal Links</B><BR>If your page has a theme, 
seek out pages with similar themes and ask the webmaster to post a link to your 
site. In exchange, you promise to add a link to their site on yours. This is a 
great way to get the word out about your site for free.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Newsgroups</B><BR>Look for newsgroups where you 
think people who would be interested in your site might frequent. Post a message 
announcing your site and its features. Don't do this too often as it is 
sometimes considered Spamming (unsolicited advertising).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Web Rings</B><BR>If there are other pages that are 
similar to yours, there might be a web ring out there dedicated to your kind of 
site. Do an internet search for "web ring" and include a keyword related to your 
site. If you join a web ring, you will need to add a web ring graphic and links 
to your page.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Advertising</B><BR>If you really want to give your 
site some exposure, you can create a banner ad and find a company that will get 
your banner put up on numerous pages. The cost generally depends on the amount 
of impressions (how many times it is seen) or click-throughs (how many times it 
is actually clicked on).</FONT></P>
