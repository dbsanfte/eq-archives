<br />
Hes a gnome, and he cons cherry red.  Hes in a huge arena type room that kinda has a green haze.  I guess it could be a ring type event or something, does anyone have any info on how to return the stone or start the event?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I believe one of our people told him &quot;I didn't steal anything&quot;  and he dribbled out some more text about having lost some of the captains stuff and asked for help finding it.  We offered to help, following the dialogue and he asked us to find a compass, a spyglass, an ocean map, and a bottle of the capn's favorite spirits that he had left and/or lost down below decks.  He then said he'd have a little reward for us and that we could avoid a fight, but then we got a text line noting that 'You feel like you should be prepared for a fight in spite of his assurances' or something along those lines.  We have not yet accumulated those pieces, but we will likely go back and try to do so.<br />

I can only assume it means that the broken skull pirates had stolen it. <br />

As for the 4 parts, I would guess that they might start the ring event or just give you a reward.<br />

<br />
I got the Mystical Spyglass from Umuuvan the Soulless(someone said the Cook dropped the spyglass),  and the Ancient Compass from the High Priest(someone said he drops the map).  <br />
<br />
Right now i'm just missing the map, I'm wondering if its possible to just camp the same named i've always been or do something different.   In my case the only named I haven't killed is the Cook and i'm only missing the Map...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DaltenEQ</div><div class="date">03-14-03, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hope this quest results in a very nice charm, otherwise its going to seem like LoY was just a huge waste of money.  <br />
<br />
The Map piece drops off a VERY rare spawn with 30 min ph's, at first glance you wouldn't even know this is a named.  This is basically like Rastar of Guk, I found him only because it was up after the last patch.  I ignored it for like 2 hours after I logged in until i noticed the name of the mob was a bit different than other mobs.  <br />
<br />
Another piece drops off a 2 Hour spawn thats triggered by clearing the room in which he spawns(a drunken buckaneer).  It seems like whenever he dies, his spawnpoint is dormant for 1.5 hours and if you kill the medics room, he will spawn approx 29.5 minutes later along with the rest of the room.   The quest piece is rare as hell so far, i got lucky and got my first one the 5th try, since then i've killed him approx 5 more times and only gotten vodka.  <br />
<br />
The last two pieces are being reported to drop off 3 different named so far, the Chef, Umuuvan, and High Priest Anaanci.  All these can probably drop the Compass or Spyglass, personally I never got anything from the chef in like 20 killings, and about 25 Umuuvan's i got 1 spyglass and about 35+ High priests i've gotten 1 compass.  High Priest seems to be the most common named at least for me, probably because his drps are the shittiest.  <br />
<br />
This isn't a gripe post, not at all, I just hope that sony realizes how much time has to be invested to even trigger the event, and I just hope it is itemized properly(Read: GOOD CHARMS).  <br />
<br />
As for the event, its eons harder than any named mob in the zone, its like comparing a zol knight in sebilis to Trakanon.  Even still its doable with a few groups i'm sure, provided you have the right classes and know what to expect, neigher of which I had but next time, this bitch is going to die if I can manage to get lucky and find the pieces again.  <br />

<br />
From the zone in:<br />
<br />
1) Where is the medical area?<br />
<br />
2) Where does the high priest spawn, and does he have a PH or a trigger?<br />
<br />
3) Where does the Chef spawn?</div></div><hr />

go down that ladder, that room is the Luggald interigator room, Next to that room (accross the hall) is the armsman room, if you go down the hall, medical room is the first right you can take (also has the rats for drunk bucc, and quartermaster in the &quot;closet&quot; type place)<br />
<br />
2. High priest spawns in the room past the treasure room, where the ladder going up is, high priest PH is the first mob you see when you enter the room, dead center, closest to the hall,<br />
<br />
3. Chef spawns in the last room before captain door, the room with the grill appropriatly enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iustus</div><div class="date">04-24-03, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a thread with similar info in the back alley:<br />
pub146.ezboard.com/fthesa...2896.topic<br />
<br />
I am now just missing the map. Can anyone confirm for me where specifically you have seen it drop?<br />
<br />
Where I got my drops:<br />
Mystical Spyglass from Umuuvan the Soulless<br />
Ancient Compass from Quartermaster Fisan<br />
Jrank's Private Reserve from drunken buccaneer<br />
<br />
I have heard something about a navigator that spawns in the 'map room'? Is this the same room as the High Priest? Ie, the room with the big globe? Can someone specify which spawn in that room is the ph? (The HP is in the middle by globe, by himself. There  is a spawn under the ladder. There are spawns along the walls on boths sides. There is a trio on either side of the HP, mixed luggalds and trolls.)<br />
<br />
“Lascar First Class” above, are not capitalized, it is “lascar first class”, and I do not think they are PHs for named. They are just a higher level troll, but I have seen them spawn in spots which are not named PHs (although they seem more common in as named PH). In named spots, I have seen many things spawn though, from scroungers to blademasters to weapon smiths. It seems that each area has a heirarchy of spawns, from scrounger, marauder, mystic to something more unique to the area (bladesmaster/rogue or weapon smith/medic for armsman room and medic room repectively). <br />
<br />
Specifically, I have seen the troll roamer which paths in the halls outside the armsman and Luggald Interrogator  rooms, and paths all the way to the luggald room with Serang Vikch spawn as a lascar first class, and I do not think he is a named spawn.<br />
<br />
some other drops I have seen:<br />
<br />
Serang Vikch <br />
-Cloak of Eternal Enlightenment<br />
<br />
Quartermaster Fisan<br />
-Ancient Compass (captain)<br />
<br />
The Luggald Interrogator<br />
-Platinum Band of Savagry<br />
<br />
Broken Skull Armsmaster<br />
-Necklace of Somber Dreams<br />
-Runed Sash of Fury<br />
<br />
The rumor is the Armsmaster is also the dropper of Platinum Sword Figurine, which I am trying to confirm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iustus</div><div class="date">05-02-03, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally got the navigator. There was some confusion about where the navigator came from, but I believe it was the same spot (to the left of the high priest, in the pit). The confusing thing, is I am not certain it spawned in the regular troll spot on the left in the pit, or whether it spawned in a new spot.<br />
<br />
The navigator looks like a Broken skull blademaster, and his name is &quot;a Broken skull navigator&quot;, so you may not realize he is a named at first. You can tell for sure he is a named because he enrages.<br />
<br />
I think perhaps he is like the drunken buccaneer, in that his spawn is strange in some way. The druken buccaneer is rumored to be triggered by clearing the room, but I know that is not exactly correct. He may be totally random. Perhaps just killing the quartermaster spawn is enough to trigger the buccaneer. Or perhaps killing any mob in the room has a small percent chance to spawn the buccaneer. <br />
<br />
Whatever it is, clearing the full room is not required to spawn the buccaneer, because I was camping the quartermaster, logging in every 30 min to kill ONLY that one spawn, and after a while I logged in and the bucaneer was up.<br />
<br />
I have killed the Broken Skull Armsmaster about 40 times now, no Platinium Sword Figurine :/<br />
<br />
I would very much like to talk to anyone who can confirm that that charm is indeed still dropping anywhere.<br />

There are 2 Spawns to the HP's left in the pit, a luggald and  Troll both facing NORTH, when the Navigator spawns he'll be at the East end of the table facing West. TMI, but now there's no excuse.<br />
<br />
Clear the room, he'll spawn eventually just to the high priest's left, next to the map and globe on the tables in the pit.<br />
<br />
I wish someone would finish this god forsaken quest and find out if a good charm results from it.  I'm 3 stacks of vodka and counting, when I chug a stack at a raid people just chuckle cause they have no clue a PITA it is.  need the buckaneer to cough up his quest piece and we'll find out what results, unless someone does it sooner.

Sony should really make him drop a decent charm every single kill.  Its a joke how poorly charms got implemented, i thought for sure this guy would drop one.. but Loot was some earring, like 30hp/80mana w/ mana pres 3 focus and a mace that procs a pet.  pic of it in my magelo.<br />

No matter how good someone's directions are, some people will make a mistake about which mob it is. Do not let this happen to you. Kill all the mobs in the room until you are sure.<br />
<br />
That said, Serang Vikch spawns on an interior corner, near where there is a light and a lasso on the wall. <br />
<br />
The Broken Skull Armsmaster spawns by an anvil with an axe in it, in the room across the hall from the Luggold Interrigator room, which is right down the ladder from the zone.<br />

<br />
3 groups we brought, got him to about 94%<br />
<br />
Lots of melee on him and several adds, and some ae's , we are working on plans for the next attempt</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kaatok</div><div class="date">05-09-03, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so once you hand the items in is he a one shot deal ? or do you get anything so you can pop him again a la key or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Spewspew</div><div class="date">05-10-03, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What happens exactly is, you camp all the pieces to get a set, not sure if you can MQ the quest or not,<br />
<br />
hand in the 4 pieces and the little gnome dude says something about finding the theives for the captain, and he scurries off locking the door behind him (assume you  cannot enter or exit the captain room) captain pops with a number of adds and thats it, kill him or be killed, <br />
<br />
in the 20 minutes it took for corpse to pop at gy, he had reset and the gnome was back up <br />
<br />
So no, every time you want to pop the captain you  need a full set of quest items<br />
<br />
BTW- since i dont see this anywhere else in this post<br />
<br />
Compass - random off any bottom deck named<br />
Spyglass- random off any top deck named<br />
Map - navigator from high priest room (no ph works somewhat like the drunk bucc but is much less rare, seems to drop map everytime)<br />
Ale- drunk bucc in the medics room no ph, just kill the spawns in his room (dont need to kill the rats) common is vodka<br />
<br />
Have done 3 sets of captains keys since drop rate increase, id say for a total set expect to camp about 50 hours a pieceish Edited by: Spewspew at: 5/13/03 3:57:19 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is pretty effing lame though, this guy needs to be dropping charms.  Why i care anymore though is beyond me, but Maybe cause of the 150+ hours spent in this lame zone... who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Spewspew</div><div class="date">05-18-03, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were still learning the fight, and we were unable to actually loot the items :/<br />
This stuff hes dropping seems to be geared towards level 60's and Id bet the haste is max 40%, and probably less.<br />
But we still have another set of captain items to go, so we shall see.<br />
He SHOULD have a good charm, he probably  doesnt though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Reptor Darkfiend</div><div class="date">05-22-03, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me share with The Safehouse some basic information on what to expect going into this fight . <br />
<br />
I had 3 groups of well equipped level 65 characters for my run at the event . This force would have been sufficient however . . .<br />
<br />
Captain Krasnok spawns at the far wall oppisite the door . <br />
<br />
4 Luggalds spawn , A Fist of Krasnok , one in each corner of the room .<br />
<br />
Some spam goes off indicating that krasnok gathers power .<br />
<br />
The room begins to chain cast 2 AE's , Hate's Fury , and Drowning Panic . Lucy it up .<br />
<br />
Captain and the 4 Fists charge .<br />
<br />
*Edit* Once the Event is Triggered there is No clicking out , or clicking in . Should you fail , Captain despawns before corpses graveyard . items consumed .<br />
<br />
Captain Krasnok hit me for a max of 630 , and rampaged , I do believe he procs a slow/curse of his own .<br />
<br />
Fist of Krasnok hit for 240ish , immune to mez , root and snare , considerable HP .<br />
<br />
What I suggest .<br />
<br />
A 2 or 3 cleric rotation for a MT on captain . Remove curse if that is a slow Captain procs on MT . A secondary assist for All DPS to eliminate adds . Plenty of melee to get a half-assed lockdown handle on the other 2 or 3 fists , to prevent them from getting to healers .<br />
<br />
Enjoy .<br />

-Thats not a strat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iustus</div><div class="date">05-25-03, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the Broken Skull Armsmaster location is as follows:<br />
<br />
From the zone, go down the ladder on the left, you land between a rat under the ladder and an undead mobs. You are now in the room with the Luggald Interrogator.<br />
<br />
If you exit that room thru the only other exit, you will be at a hallway, and facing an entrance to another room across the hallway.<br />
<br />
The Armsmaster spawns in that very same room across the hallway, he is the spawn at the anvil with an axe in it.<br />
<br />
If you proceed down the hall, there is a large room on your right, and the hall turns and proceeds to the left and then turns again at another rat. The large room on the right is the one with the Quartemaster and the drunken buccaneer.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
For the Captain event, all the the mini-spawns have a chance to drop an item. We killed several of them before we were sure about the respawn, and got two different items (a neck and something else, I will have to check my logs).<br />
<br />
If you want more items, and have overkill, you can kill the add mobs for extra loot. If you just want to win, before you wipe, then focus on killing the captain and tanking the adds.<br />
<br />
I did it with just over twenty very well equipped lvl 65s, counting about 4 bots, and it was pretty easy. <br />
<br />
The captain himself has two drops. We got two melee earrings. (Will check log for a link).<br />

<br />
I think at the end of the fight we had about 15 people left out of 50ish.  Just a note without spoiling the fun:  Low health agro sucks nads here.<br />
<br />
The link to the earring should be on Allakhazam's before long.  I sent it last night.   Congradulations to anybody else who does this fight .. it is fun!</div></div><hr />
