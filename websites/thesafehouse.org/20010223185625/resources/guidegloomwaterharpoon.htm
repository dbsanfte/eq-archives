        Guide to Upper Kedge Keep</font></b></strong></font><font size="5"><b><font color="#000080"><strong> 
        (Gloomwater Harpoon)</strong></font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><b><i>Submitted by Wolvinsbane Latrocinor</i></b><i> <br>
        Edited by Zato</i> </p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">This guide is written to be as helpful 
        as possible with ANY group makeup. The group I go to Kedge with is made 
        of of the following. Although it's high, you do not need this type of 
        firepower to control the upper level (except for some exceptions, mentioned 
        later). 50th Cleric 46th Druid 41st Warrior 37th Druid 35th Enchanter 
        32nd Rogue (dats me!) </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">First off, before you go to Kedge 
        Keep, go to the Inn that is in East Commons RIGHT NEXT TO the zone to 
        West Commons and buy a TON of Fish Scales for your druid/enchanter so 
        that he can cast Enduring Breath. Bards can also come in handy with their 
        EB song. You could also get a Rebreather or Aqualung from an Tinkerer 
        and support their trade. They can be expensive though. Magicians can also 
        summon Waterstones for underwater breathing and are great for those times 
        when your Enduring Breath (EB) is fading during combat (which it shouldn't, 
        more on that later) and you need to keep alive till your EBer can recast 
        it on you. You can also purchase Potions of Water Breathing in Halas I 
        believe. They go for 12pp. Our group got 6 of them and have them hotkeyed 
        just in case of emergencies. On the subject of underwater combat. Few 
        things you should be aware of. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Melee Classes</b> -</font> <font color="#FFFFFF">When 
        hit underwater by these fish, you get pushed back. At first it's tough 
        to fight underwater, but you'll get used to it fast. Generally, you want 
        to find something to prop yourself against so you don't get pushed out 
        of attack range if the fish swings around and hits you back. It's not 
        nessecery, but it is helpful. Just past the Pull Zone (on the map below) 
        right before it opens up into the room is a ledge (you'll see it when 
        you get there and understand) that you can prop up against when your puller 
        drags it into the hallway there. You cannot swim backwards normally. If 
        you duck (D key) you can swim backwards though! Also if you have SOW cast 
        on you before you go in you can swim backwards. You will also run low 
        on stamina alot because of swimming and fighting. Enchanters should have 
        augmentation on everyone to help with this, and other classes have stamina 
        regeration spells if need be. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Casters</b> -</font> <font
        color="#FFFFFF">Movement back / forth WILL interupt your casting, up down 
        (without forward or backward movement) will NOT interupt your casting. 
        Be aware that if a fish hits you, you WILL float backwards and thus, interupt 
        your casting. It is HIGHLY suggested that casters stay in the corners, 
        that way if they're hit, they don't float back and at least have the chance 
        to roll for a continued casting. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>On Enduring Breath</b> - </font><font color="#FFFFFF">It 
        is the ENTIRE group's responsibility to be aware of the time remaining 
        on EB. If someone dies due to drowning, it's EVERYONE's fault for not 
        keeping on top of it. Enduring Breath is a 25 minute spell. Have someone 
        in your group with a stopwatch start timing when the first EB is cast 
        and let the group know when 20 minutes have elapsed. Recast when he says 
        the 20 mins are up. Don't wait the full 25 mins, no need to cut it close. 
        Everyone in the group should be aware of time remaining. Don't get angry 
        with folks asking &quot;time on EB&quot; ... they just want to be informed. 
        Casters under level 35 have the problem of not even being able to tell 
        when it runs out until they are gulping for air, which is often times 
        too late to save them.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>On Rezzing in Kedge</b> -</font> <font color="#FFFFFF">If 
        you have a death in Kedge, and you have a Cleric who can Rez, have your 
        Druid or Enchanter ready to cast Enduring Breath on the newly rezzed player. 
        Also have the Cleric ready on the heal. Rez sickness wipes any and all 
        buffs from the player, you'll have to be ready with the buffs. Okay, on 
        to the actual fighting... </font></p>

      <p align="center"><img

        border="2" width="400" height="318"></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong><u>Creatures on the First Floor</u></strong><strong> 
        </strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">30-31 - Lancer Swordfish (blue to 
        me at 32) 33 and up - Piercer Swordfish (yellow and red to me at 32) 42ish 
        - Impaler Swordfish (RED to me) 43ish - Fierce Impaler Swordfish (RED 
        to me) </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Lancers</b> - Not too many HPS. 
        They hit hard (60s) and fast (double, triple hits). Great XP for a mid 
        30s group. Lancers are 98% of what you will see on the upper level. They 
        are placeholders for the ONE Impaler/Fierce Impaler and few Piercers that 
        spawn on this floor. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Piercers</b> - Can be nasty. They 
        tended to be more RED then Yellow to me at 32. I'd say they average in 
        the 34 to 37 levels. They are pretty much the same as Lancers 'cept they 
        hit for more in the 70s and have a good amount more HPS. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Impalers</b> - 42 or so creatures. 
        They are VERY nasty. They hit hard (101 was a common theme) and fast (double 
        hit for 101 is fast enough for me). They also have a LOT of HPS. Do NOT 
        let your casters get these aggro on them, you'll be minus a caster before 
        you can do much. Seemed to spawn every half hour instead of one of the 
        Lancer spawns on the far end of the room from the pull area. Those spawns 
        are near the ceiling. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Fierce Impaler</b> - Take an Impaler, 
        give it more HPS and let it hit more in the 110-20 range. This creature 
        drops the </font><font
        color="#0000FF"><b>Gloomwater Harpoon</b></font><font
        color="#FFFFFF"> that we all are after. It is a RARE spawn that takes 
        the place of one of the Impaler spawns. Rare for even a rare spawn. I 
        suggest that a mid 30 group be VERY careful with the Impaler and Fierce 
        Impaler. You best have a VERY cohesive group. I'd venture to say that 
        a upper 30s group could take the Impaler and Fierce Impaler spawns. The 
        roaming path marked on the map is where the two flanking lancer spawns 
        will roam. They just go back and forth. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#CCFFFF"><b>Upper Level Tactics</b> - </font><font color="#FFFFFF">Tactics 
        used in this area were pretty basic. Basically, be aware that you're prolly 
        going to be pulling multiple fishies. We had an Enchanter who could Mez 
        or Charm the extras. Druids can also Charm the fish. This can be vital 
        during fights down here as these fish are very nasty critters. I highly 
        suggest and Enchanter in the group. If not, have your Druid Charm an extra 
        fish if you get in trouble. Beware that when Charm breaks, the Charmie 
        is going to be VERY angry at your Druid, so beware. If you have an Enchanter 
        or Shamen, use a SLOWNESS spell. It's a GREAT spell down there. Make sure 
        to have your casters wait till the meleers have taken the creature down 
        a bit before nuking it. Fish and casters do NOT go well together. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#CCFFFF"><b>INFO for HIGHER level groups camping 
        the Gloomwater Harpoon</b> -</font><font
        color="#FFFFFF"> If the upper room is cleared and you want to pull something, 
        there are some Fanged Tooth Piranna right when you go down on the second 
        floor. <b>BEWARE</b> of them. They were BLUE to the level 50 cleric in 
        our group. They hit hard (80s, double attack) and have A CRAPLOAD of HPS. 
        I'd venture to say they're considerably nastier than Seafury Cyclopses. 
        Our group (the one outlined at the begining of this post) could manage 
        3 of them at a time, but this was ONLY because of our Enchanter and Druids 
        charming and Mezing, even then, we found ourselves medding during the 
        fight and, well, it was prolly the nastiest fight I've witness in my time 
        in EQ, and I've seen some nasty ones. You WILL pull more than one from 
        the below level. Be warned, they are VERY nasty. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#CCFFFF"><b>Other Facts -</b></font><font
        color="#FFFFFF"><b> </b>Most creatures can NOT see invis </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#CCFFFF"><b>Conclusions</b> - </font><font color="#FFFFFF">This 
        is prolly my favorite zone in all of Norrath. It's great fun to play down 
        there. The XP is simply GREAT for a mind 30s group camping the upper level. 
        Do NOT go down there for loot, it sucks (only got cash of the Shark on 
        the second level). All in all, it's a GREAT time. I hope this guide has 
        enlighted those of you wanting to go down there and get your Gloomwaters 
        and helps you have a good time. Good luck fellow Rogues!</font></p>
