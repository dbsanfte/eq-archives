What kind of damage should be happening and what kind of damage actually takes place right now? and what percentage of the time would the venom be resisted?<br />

I am sorry if these are too n00b questions but this is first time that i have played any RPG type with any degree in interest. Played BG2 but didnt get into what worked where type detail, understandably, i wasnt very successful  <br />

Quote: Q: What benefits does specializing in Envenom yield?<br />
<br />
A: Specializing in Envenom yields the following benefits:<br />
<br />
a) Decreases the chance of failing to apply the poison to a weapon (NOTE: I believe chance to fail application has been removed entirely!)<br />
b) Increases the duration of a poison's effect (ie snare, disease, debuff). <br />
c) Increases the damage caused by the &quot;lethal&quot; variety of poisons (ie damage-over-time)<br />
 d) Allows access to higher level poisons (see the poison list below).</div></div><hr />

Wha?<br />
<br />
Quote: <br />
A: The number preceding the poison's name is the level of the poison and the level at which you can apply it, based on your Envenom specializtion. For instance, a L15 Nightshade with Envenom 6 would only be able to use level 6 and under poisons (see poison tables below for poison levels).<br />

When I read the guide listed on the Stratics web-site yesterday morning, it had said that a level 15 night shade could use a level 15 poison even if his Envenom skill was only at 1.<br />

<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
<br />
3.7 What does the number next to the poison's name indicate? <br />
  <br />
The number preceding the poison's name is the level of the poison. The poison's level indicates the level at which you can apply any particular poison which is completely independent of your Envenom skill. For instance, a level 15 Nightshade can apply Major Lethal Poison (level 15) even if he/she has an Envenom skill of 1.<br />

<br />
And then I died with that last blow. But as you can see, there are more then 5 poisoned messages.. Look at the times 17:06:35 and 17:06:36. Thats when I switched my primary weapon. So maybe you cant dual weild weapons with the same poison (and get both effects), but you can definatly switch to a weapon with the same poison, and have them stack. Either that or the game takes into account that the mob has been poisoned twice, and activates the second poison after the first is finished? Not sure exactly. While I never saw a double poison message per round, something was going on when I switched weapons mid fight. Dunno. Im probably wrong, hehe.<br />
<br />
At the very least, it kept the mob poisoned throughout the entire fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grinkle</div><div class="date">11-04-01, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I read your log - <br />
<br />
Bastard Sword poison<br />
tick 1<br />
tick 2<br />
tick 3 <br />
dagger swapped in<br />
tick 4<br />
tick 5 (end of Bastard Sword Poison)<br />
First hit with Stilleto<br />
tick 1<br />
etc<br />
<br />
Its not possible to tell if the two ticks between dagger and stilleto were the tail end of bastard sword or the first ticks of dagger, or what, as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
My theory is that the dagger poison was wasted, and the stilleto poison started a new cycle - but I would sure like to find out I'm wrong!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ScarletAdept</div><div class="date">11-05-01, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Poison we get at Envenom 5 seems to do about 50% more than the level 1 poison.  I get 10 and 11 damage more consistantly and sometimes 14.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that if my Nightshade uses Critical Strikes and Piercing Styles (and staminia) she only strikes with her Right Hand -- if I constantly use the special styles.<br />
<br />
I use this to my advantage with Envenom.  When the poison from the Righthand weapon weapon wears off, I stop doing attack styles until the lefthand can hit and release a second dose of damage poison.<br />
<br />
Maybe this only works because my Celtic Dual skill is only two.  I too rarely get a double-hit from both hands.  I am considering using a shield, except when I want to apply poisons to both hand-weapons.</div></div><hr />

For example, lethal poison on one and weakening poison on the other. Perhaps if you wanted to be fancy you could use the third type of poison on a blade to be swapped out from inventory.<br />

I read over the poison FAQ, and I had a few questions about the poisons.<br />
<br />
= At the top of the poison list with snare effects it says:<br />
Snare (reduces target's movement rate until the target is struck again)<br />
-- here i'm assuming that the 'snare' poisons are effecting the target's walking/running speed, and NOT attack speed, for clarity-- <br />
<br />
I was hoping maybe I read this wrong, cos it sounds like the snare effect 'breaks' as soon as the target is hit again - presumably with my melee?  Is this really so?<br />
<br />
If it is, has anyone found any really good uses for the snare poison?  It doesn't make much sense to me.<br />
<br />
= Also, for the strength debuff, i'd be curious to see approximate figures about what level poisons debuff how much strength (i.e. how high a lvl of envenom would you need to encumber certain classes, etc)<br />
<br />
= Is the poison/bleeding bug that Krimzan brought up supposed to work that way?  I'd like to know if it's likely to get changed )<br />
<br />
= And then finally, with the disease poisons - I wonder if a healer using cure disease would counteract this spell entirely?<br />
<br />

Also, unless they actually do make it a ability instead of a skill, it is pretty much a waste unless ur willing to put 50 points into it, the dmg it puts in during battle is worthless unless ur trying to fight yellows alone, and in a group u would it would probably die by the time the first tick happens</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm due to get greater lethal next level, and can confirm it'll be at least 27, given that major right now is 22 flat..Perhaps 21 against red and up.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I decided to NOT go the route of using two different nasties on two weapons..Not, at least, until I get Enervating. As things stand, I keep the DoT on all three of my swords. I open with a Garrote (assuming I am pulling), let the primary poison kick in and then garrote until down to just enough endurance to switch to a heavier, slower bastard sword with the same DoT. Now, IF the offhand pokes itself in there, that's fine...If not, I'll hold off a garrote about halfway down the enemy's health...<br />
<br />
Two reasons why I use the DoT on both of my equipped weapons:<br />
1) Whilst they do not stack, the poison WILL deal its base Damage upon contact..Even if the foe is poisoned. In essence, it elongates the DoT effect AND tags a good 22 damage onto an otherwise sorry offhand hit<br />
2) Even the level 17 weakening poison doesn't seem to reduce the enemy's damage output significantly..Talking PvE here. I'm waiting oh-so-impatiently for Enervating...And praying these past few levels of agony (I'm used to have PA and high stealth by 21!!!) are worth it...<br />
<br />
Oh, and I switch to a heavy weapon to finish because its swing speed doesn't factor into things IF it is the final swing...And a garrote, even at my level, with a yellow bastard sword, and that 22 damage tagged on, can be enough to end things. I know..I'm wasting the last DoT there...Ah well.<br />
<br />
Currently level 20 with 19 venom, 10 natural stealth (14-15 with items), 18 CS, 2 blades. I know..It looks messed up...There may be method to the madness yet. Charan Jaydemyr<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ordieth</div><div class="date">12-15-01, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think they need to tweak poisons a little bit, they are very weak in comparison to spell and shouts that other classes get.  The level 50 lethal poison, Lifesbane, does 50 damage per tick (for 5 ticks).  However the Albion Cabalist, for example, with just 35 points in Core Matters gets a DoT spell that does 63 dam for 4 ticks.  With 49 points in Matter Manipulation they get a DoT for 89 points for 6 ticks!<br />
<br />
As for our debuffing poisons, many casters get far better debuffs from spells.  Alot of these spells are Area Effect.<br />
The Hibernian Champion, a tank class, gets Shouts that are insta-cast that are far more effective than our debuffing poisons.  Ive been told that Minor Enervating poison you get at 22 envenom lowers STR and CON by about 40.  A Champ with 24 Valor can instantly drop your STR/CON by 79, then do the same to your DEX/QUICK.  He can do this at range, too, while our poisons require a melee hit.  They also get similar attack speed debuffs, snares, and DD shouts.  Ive been hit with these and lemme tell ya, it sucks.  If these shouts are half as effective in PvE as they are in RvR then Champs must have a really easy time soloing.<br />
<br />
We need some stronger poisons to compete with this!</div></div><hr />

 ATTENTION: In game poison testing has started. <br />
Ahmed, a really cool Saracen Infiltrator, joined me in the cold waste lands of Odin's Gate a couple days ago. Though we are mortal enemies, we came together with a common goal, to figure out what our mystery poisons actually do to other beings. I myself have a 25 spec in poison and I am going all the way to 50 with it. Ahmed, he has a much lower spec in envenom, but, being the lab rat of our pair, he exclaimed often that he wished he had more spec in envenom. I felt terrible slashing him repeatedly while he stood there. Many times he evaded, I know it was just a the jitters from how bad my lil blade hurts, but he he stuck it through. The real irony of our meeting was when Demnos showed up at the end, a very quarky Hibernian Nightshade niether of us had invited. Ill tell you of Demnos' appearance at the end of this post. On to the results! <br />
<br />
We tested each poison at least twice, some 3 or 4 times. On each poison, an icon appeared on the victims screen. When right cliking this icon, you can see what poison is active in your bloodstream at that time. We tested all poisons availabe to a 25 envenom skill. <br />
<br />
Lets start with our snare poisons: <br />
Minor Imbalance duration 35 second - no real valuable slow down <br />
Lesser Imbalance - same as minor <br />
Major Imbalance - same as minor <br />
Greater Imbalance - same as minor <br />
Minor Crippling - 2 minute duration, slightly noticeable slow down <br />
<br />
Now on to our mysterious disease poisons: <br />
While Ahmed was infected and sitting, he did not naturally heal any hit points. We could not test whether or not it cut heal spells in half or not, but I believe it does. We did, however, discover that the disease poisons DO carry a slight str debuff to them, and we now believe, though its very hard to test, that they also carry a slight attack debuff with them. <br />
Minor Infectious - duration 1 minute, -9 to strength <br />
Lesser Infectious - duration 1 min 30 sec, -14 to strength <br />
<br />
How about those Damage Over Time (dot) poisons!?! <br />
Minor Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 9-11dmg <br />
Lesser Letha Poison did 5 tics of 10-13dmg <br />
Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 16-18dmg <br />
Major Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 17-22dmg <br />
Greater Lethal Poison did 5 tics of 22-26dmg <br />
Minor Lethal Venom did 5 tics of 26 to 31dmg <br />
<br />
Now for the big surprise of the poisons. I rarely used the weakening line of poisons because I did not see much use for them in personal use. But, according to our good victim Ahmed, they really put the ripple effect in cripple. <br />
Minor Weakness 20 pt str loss, 1 minute duration <br />
Lesser Weakness 27 pt str loss, 1 min duration <br />
Major Weakness 37 pt str loss, 1 min dura <br />
Greater Weakness 47 pt str loss, 1 min dura <br />
Minor Enervating 62pt str loss, 8pt con loss, 320hp loss, 1 min dur <br />
Second attempt on Minor Evervating caused different results: <br />
41pt str loss, 41pt con loss, 210hp loss, 1 min dura <br />
So, the enervating line really purts the hurt on tanks. It steals their mighty strenght and their valuable version of power called endurance. Watch that duration, though, they get it all back if they are not dead before the 1 minute is up. <br />
<br />
It was NOT easy testing all these. It was a LOT of fun, though. Special thanks to Ahmed for helping me out. I look forward to meeting you to test other rogue things on, especially our higher up poisons. Anyone still curious about Demnos? hehe. That little bugger! <br />
<br />
Well, Ahmed and I had JUST finished testing. We both had gotten comfortable with each other and were lax about not using stealth. All I will say is, we were inside a structure that protected us from the cold elements of Odin's Gate. The room we were in had windows. I was chilling there, arranging some poisons to test in combinations on Ahmed while he was sitting and recovering from a very painful Minor Enervating + Minor Lethal Venom combo, when suddenly he dies. I glance up from my backpack thinking maybe the dot had killed him, but to my surprise I see a tiny dark figure jump out of one of the windows! It was freaky! I didnt know anyone could get in and out of those windows! But a Lurikeen sure can! I tried to squeeze my lil kobold body out of it in pursuit, but he got away. I knew he had seen me. He though he was the cat, haha, but little did he know, he was the mouse. I chased him stealthed all over that wall while he looked for me. At the right patient moment, I let fly a nasty envenomed trio of blades into his backside. He crumpled before he even knew what hit him. Little bass terd. I hope we can meet again, I salute his wondeful style! <br />
<br />
Thanks to Ahmed <br />
Salute to Demnos <br />

Xunis has basically retired, so someone else needs to pick up the ingame testing.  My own SB intends to get 50 envenom, eventually, but for right now, I'm at 30 envenom at level 35 and it won't be going up majorily for a few levels still.  When I do start upping it again, I wouldn't mind hooking up with someone with a high level poison using assassin on MLF (hibby or alby, obviously) and doing some ingame testing.

<br />
So I decided to repeat the poison tests run at The Tarnished Dagger since some people had thought they changed, and some things were not tested completely. I play Sammy on Gawaine, a 40 Nightshade, and Krelios, a 41 Infiltrator agreed to help. We met in the Albion frontier since no one ever goes there, found a secluded area and ran some tests.<br />
<br />
I have a 26 Envenom, Krelios has 30. Here are the results:<br />
<br />
Lethal poisons (DoTs): These do varying damage based on the target's level (is it lower level than you, higher level, etc.). These poisons last 5 or 6 rounds, it seemed to be random which it was.<br />
<br />
Lesser Lethal Venom: 29-35 / rd when 41 used on 40 (Krelios used on me)<br />
Minor Lethal Venom: 24-30 / rd when 41 used on 40, 22-26 when 40 used on 41.<br />
<br />
Lesser Enervating Poison: 75 pt str/con debuff when 41 used on 40. My hps went from 693 to 325. I was still at full health, but my max was now 325. After one minute, when the poison wore off however, my con and str returned to normal BUT my hps stayed at 325 while my max went back to 693, leaving me at less than half health. The damage caused by his attack did NOT add to the damage, meaning the debuff is applied after the damage.<br />
<br />
Minor Enervating: 58 pt str/con debuff when 41 used on 40, hps went from 693 to 421. 41 pt str/con debuff when 40 used on 41, hps went from 715 to 539. So the level of your target affects how these debuffs work.<br />
<br />
Infectious Serum This caused a 20 pt str debuff no matter what - 41 on 40 and 40 on 41. It prevented any health regen and we assume would cause heals to work at half. It lasted about 2 minutes, all the others lasted one minute.<br />
<br />
Lesser Crippling Poison Worthless. Caused maybe a 20% reduction in run speed. Didn't even slow as much as Garrotte does.<br />
<br />
Well that's the results, hope I didn't forget anything. After we were done, we decided to duel. We equipped poisons, but did not use PA to open, we just started whacking. Well, Krelios' Enervating poison stuck, and he resisted mine! That means that after the first hit, I was at less than half hps, and he was near full, and my str was -7! Needless to say, he owned me totally, I never had a chance. If you are not using your PA, the enervating is really very good. BTW, I was worth 301 rps at the time ). Hope this helps peeps in choosing their poisons, and I want to say thanks to Krelios, that was a lot of fun. Next time my poison will stick!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maoudeib</div><div class="date">01-17-02, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it was fun testing those poisons out.<br />
<br />
Some obversations I've had from these tests and from RVR and PVE use.<br />
<br />
I would highly advise against going full spec in poison.  Our tests confirmed that a couple of the poisons were pretty useless.  For example, I really expected the lesser crippling poison to snare an opponent more than it did.  Plus infectious serum just seemed to be a much weaker version of the enervating poison.<br />
<br />
In addition, I found that putting more spec into envenom means putting less into more important skills such as stealth, critical strike, and thrust.<br />
<br />
After frequently using poisons in battle, I'd recommend using enervating on the main weapon, and lethal on the side.  It's all about doing max damage as quick as possible, especially if you catch an orange con or lower solo on the frontier.<br />
<br />
As has already been noted, in RVR players will observe their hps relative to their target.  So enervating is a good way to &quot;fool&quot; the target into thinking they have more hps left than they really do.  It helps lower the target's melee capabilities in addition to the immediate hp loss, especially against melee using strength related weapons like crush and slash.<br />
<br />
Finally regarding using poisons in PVE, you need to be careful. It's often best NOT to be the puller.  Also, you should wait until the main tank(s) get a good hit or two before attacking, otherwise you will certainly get agro.  Grouping with an equal level paladin running heal chant helps a great deal.  However, hitting too early with poison and crit strikes can even outagro heal chanting paladins sometimes.<br />

<br />
The one thing you didn't try... race with one person diseased.  See who's faster   Disease is very valuable on both archer and healer killing.  Further points out how useless the snare poison is.  Why use it when disease doesn't break if you hit the target again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A dot poison will hit the mob for 5 rounds (typically).  If you drop another dot poison on them before the other has run it's course you do not get 2 times the damage.  The second Dot will cause the first one to end, and the second one will then hit the mob for it's customary 5 rounds.<br />
<br />
I generally have the DOT and weaken poisons on my 2 primary weapons when I perform my backstab.  After 5 or 6 rounds of mele that dot will be running out. so I change my right hand to weild the weapon in the 2hand (I'm still dual wielding with the weapon in my left hand.)  I keep another dose of the DOT on that weapon, so I can dot them twice a fight.  I also keep 2 other blades in my backback with different poisons on them incase I get in trouble or get an add.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure many of you already do this, but just thought I would phrase it a bit more clearly for any newbies that happen through.<br />

As a shadowblade, I open with a two handed sword and weakening.  If the mob looks mostly dead by the end of my CS chain, then I finish it off with the two handed sword.  If it isn't (I miss or something dreadful like that) I click my one hand sword icon, my left axe icon, and then swing again (with DOT on one, and snare on the other).  I've also tried changing the order that I apply these poisons, such as opening with snare (which seems to greatly increase the critical damage of the second and third hit) then going to DOT and weakening, however, I've found that having DOT and snare on my 'backup' weapons is useful if I draw an add after finishing off the primary target (sort of a 'parting gift' as I run away).</div></div><hr />

We have at least three lengthy posts recently about testing, with some specific numbers/effects cited.<br />

In addition, the snare is now no longer &quot;worthless&quot; and will slow an opponent considerably, even after being hit.<br />

Disease doesn't seem to snare at all anymore, but appears to keep the target from sprinting.<br />

Alchemy is coming in the foreseeable future (there will be a Q&amp;A on it at the Fan Faire next weekend), will be accessable to Assassins as one of its class groups, and will involve crafting poisons as one of its benefits. ====<br />

<br />
why do you have to train in a specific type of poison...snare, DoT, stuff like that why cant you be good at them all?.....and can some one post some good DoT and or Snare poisons good to take up skill and easy to get venom sacs for at skill lvl like 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dawg enD</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no skill level 60.  Were you thinking this post was for EQ?  It's for DAoC.  And, in DAoC, you don't have to invest points in a type of poison. You put points into envenom and you can use any poisons up to the level you are at, modified.<br />
<br />
If you have 5 envenom, +2 items then you can use poisons level 1-7. Perception is reality...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ManhunterDM</div><div class="date">08-19-02, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok  heres  the way it  works if using  the same poison on different blades.  You do your opening move, and the  poison clics,  it starts ticking, doing its  damage each tic. WHENEVER  the 2nd blade hits, and the poison from that blade hits,  the timer starts again,  the  first poison that hit ends,  and the new one starts and runs until its time runs out. When  that 2nd  blade hits determines how much good it  does to use the  same poison on  both blades.  If it hits and kicks  in right after the first one,, oh well  not  much  help..  but if it  lands  just  as the  other poison has worn off, or  close to that, you will have almost double the effect. I myself use two different poisons on the right and  left handed blades, and put a 2nd dose of whichever I want on a blade in my  BP.  I  just wait until a good time in the fight and switch that blade into my right hand . With just  a lil practice you can time that  weapon swap and  hardly miss a  hit. Can also have a blade with a snare on it to swap off,  just in case  you need  to give them one more  hit, then kite out of there because the  rest of the other realms coming  to beat you to  a  pile  of  mush.</div></div><hr />
