It's not like Furor's taking over the company or even anything remotely of that nature. He's just a quest writer(this is assuming the story is even true).<br />

I wonder how many people putting him down have even read any of the fantasy work he's had up on the FoH website? It's pretty good stuff. Gage Kitheri<br />

Pretty disapointed as a Warcraft fan to see the best they could do is copy EQ and program it better. Only major difference I can see from WoW and EQ at this point is questing is fast XP but will become so linear and boring after 1-2 characters due to the quicker leveling rate. Ive read its only 5 days played to hit 30 so if its this fast I have real concerns about any sort of end game content that can be sustainable other than release more expansions, increase power curve the whole EQ pit falls all over again. Shiny on the outside w/ a fresh new feel, but on the inside where it matters nothing but EQ, designed to lure EQ players away.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">04-14-04, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in my case it's more that he's created this public persona that's for one thing banned after trying to pull major attitude here, for another thing not exactly known for his gentle tact, polite soothing words, or anything close to casual gaming style. It's the same as when I'm skeptical of Sigil's promises of a game that does things better and is more fun.<br />
<br />
Maybe he'll be a really great quest writer, we wouldn't know for sure. All I (and most of us I imagine) have seen of him does not exactly scream &quot;Hey I'm good at writing quests and enjoy RP stuff&quot;. I can only give initial reactions based on what I've seen or heard of someone so far, and it would be foolish not to use past experience as a basis. That doesn't mean I won't give him as a quest writer a chance any more than it means I'll boycot Vanguard. It just means the initial faction is set to dubious rather than indifferent to put it in EQ terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardoc the Dwarf</div><div class="date">04-14-04, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But you have to realise if he got the job he stops being Furor the angry guild leader that makes many changes and becomes Alex (think that is his name) the quest designer for Blizzard.  At this point he stops being a public personality, and thus loses the pulpit from which he preaches his message (that you all see the vulgarity and nothing else) from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">04-14-04, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will he? The vehemence he's known for doesn't inspire confidence in that on my end. Again, not saying he won't get a chance, but his playstyle, views and the manner in which he's presented them will make me wary. And the playstyle is the big one, I'm not convinced that someone like him will make good quests for casual gamers.<br />
<br />
Look, I've heard that he's very polite when dealing with GMs, but we don't get to see that part of him so how would we know? Most of us just got to see the guy who got (quite rightly) banned from the SH for being a dink. Maybe he can easily shed the Furor attitude as he moves on and maybe even with the company policies he can't resist, but until I see proof I'm not gonna go singing his praise anymore than I'll go out and join the Sigil Fanboy Club because they say they've learned their lessons from EQ. It's a simple case of &quot;I don't trust ya much till you prove it&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Having Furor in a creative position in any game doesn't exactly leave me feeling all warm and tingly.  It will be hilarious, however, when people start flaming the weak parts of his quests.<br />

Of course,any worthwile guild leader in EQ or any other major game ends up having his guild as a full time job. Not sure i can blame them for being vocal when they invest so much time.<br />
<br />
As far as blizzard goes. The only groundbreaking games they created are warcraft,and diablo. All there remakes,of those 2 games are just that. Redone warcraft in space,or warcraft 2-3 etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
They really havnt produced a New game in years. If you think starcraft is really that innovative you really need to go back and play some older computer games.</div></div><hr />

Which is about 2 more than MOST companies ever produce.<br />
<br />
Ground-brealing and genre-defining games are not easy to come by, and Blizzard has 2.  And at the same time Blizzard has also earned the reputaion as one of the best expansion pack companies in the business as well.<br />
<br />
But I digress, as far as Furor goes, I hope that he does prove incapable of giving up the ranting even with his job.  Cause then maybe he'll get fired.  Which will be awsome because Furor jobless makes me giggly!</div></div><hr />

Only thing I find remotely new to WoW is the little bit of lore Warcraft has and a small amount of gameplay perhaps inside instanced battlefields. For someone who hasnt ever played Warcraft I doubt you see much of my points at all. Im speaking against WoW as a Warcraft player not a MMO player. As a MMO player its look ok, but nothing original.</div></div><hr />

Furor was rightfully angry, after all, he and his guild &quot;beta'd&quot; supposedly complete zones, making them better for..YOU. I'd be mad too after the first 4 or 5 times, I'm sure.<br />
Having seen the average maturity level of EQ players, it also leaves to wonder why everyone seems to be getting on their soapbox over this. I've seen ALOT worse people and players in the game.<br />
Tigole isnt a saint, like many are trying to imply. He got quite crude. While he never posted the &quot;Fix this @#%$ or I'm out&quot; (which by the way, Sony fixxed), he still wasn't the golden child of PR. But he does his job incredibly well. WoW will be better for him.<br />
WoW will be better for having Furor.<br />
If you want to deny yourself the game because of one very skilled, very experienced player, then fine, the game doesn't need you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vendrix</div><div class="date">04-16-04, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thought of someone not playing WoW simply because Furor has been recruited to write quests is, well, laughable… and that’s an understatement. I’m far from a Furor fanboi, I think I’ve read, maybe, 2-3 posts on the FoH board in the 5 years I’ve played EQ, but I know for damn sure that quest writing doesn’t require a Pulitzer prize winning author.<br />
<br />
Think about it, could he really do any worse than the average quest writer in EQ? I don’t see how that’s humanly possible. The vast majority of EQ quests are written at a 3rd grade reading level, often times with numerous misspellings and sentences full of ambiguous or, even better, incorrect information. I’m sure he’s done the same amount of quests as the average Joe, making him well aware of the potential screw-ups that can occur. If I were in his shoes, I would have a handy little checklist beside my PC as I wrote them…<br />
<br />
1. Spelling / Grammar – duh!<br />
2. Not everyone uses ShowEQ – If you’re going to make someone look for a ground spawn, give them a god damn hint of where it is and definitely tell them what zone.<br />
3. Not everyone has the Lewis &amp;amp; Clark gene – Making characters run across eight different zones, take two boats and swim for 15-minutes underwater may be a bit much.<br />
4. Not everyone has an armada in tow – Give a hint about required force if a mob kill is involved, don’t lead someone to believe they can solo if it really requires a force of 30+ people. Marauder Melvyn Muk - Conquest<br />

WoW goes from &quot;wow, this game rocks&quot; to &quot;well, it's becomming just an eq rip-off&quot; to &quot;starcraft, warcraft, all of blizzards games are nothing but copycats and now that furor works for them wow will suck donkey nuts&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you people think an online persona of a person is always 100% in line with their real life attitudes and puncuality then I got some land in the ocean to sell ya. I happen to find the character funny as hell, a welcome diversion from the mindless dribble and nob slobbing that most of the populace blindly follows to from some of the supposed community leaders.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to play WoW when it hits retail that's your perogitive. Saying it's going to be nothing but garbage because a very vocal member of everquest is on the dev team is quite nieve. Every game in developement currently IS a copy of something out already, or did you all happen to forget that? There's not much room left for innovation in this industry, but oh so much room for refinement and actually getting ideas down and working the way they should.<br />

I'm not a blizzard fanboy nor am I a sony hater, I am just a gamer that see's stuff for what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phantron</div><div class="date">04-18-04, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very few games are unique anyway.  Blizzard's biggest strength is really BNet, which is a pretty risky thing they did in the early days of multiplayer gaming but it paid off huge.  If I have to look at Blizzard games from a purely objective point of view they are merely average to above-average, but the multiplayer aspect of BNet simply blows the competition away.  A game retains a quality by the virtue of being big when it's big enough.  EQ is like this too.<br />
<br />
As for quest dialogues, people greatly overestimate the value of good writing.  No one's going to get a premier writer to do the quest writing and the difference between '3rd grade writing' and whatever you believe is good writing is pretty much nonexistent.  Maybe people would care the first time they read it, but unless it's content that's consumed only once (which is unlikely, since it'd imply a ridiculous amount of content), by the 5th time you saw the same quest dialogue you'll just be asking who's the moron who thought this dialogue was clever and wasting your time having to read it for the 5th time, no matter who wrote it.  For most people, something along the lines of:  &quot;Collect item X Y Z and return for loot&quot; is all the lore they ever need to know.   Phantron</div></div><hr />

First of all, to the person who posted that the community's stance changes a lot, you are mistaking a small group's viewpoint for that of the entire community.  That's quite wrong.  The feel of the community at large is that WoW is interesting and will probably be a good MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Also, to the subject at hand, no, I'm not terribly thrilled that Blizzard hired Furor to do anything except clean their toilets.  However, this will affect my perspective of the game about as much as the fact that, say, they serve coconut cake instead of chocolate.  I hate coconut cake.  But I'll still buy their game.<br />
<br />
As to my personal feelings about Furor, he is one of the very few people that I would wish RL grievous bodily harm upon.  The depth of my dislike for someone as belligerient, arrogant, disrespectful, and immature as Furor is nigh boundless.  I'd give up being a WoW beta tester to punch him in the balls, and that's saying a lot.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver (retired)<br />

Reading this after just paging through 6 pages of bitching and moaning in the &quot;fatigue&quot; post really makes me laugh.   People complaining about levelling too quickly and other complaining about levelling too slow and XP being nerfed and everything else.<br />
<br />
No matter what is done there will always be a whining vocal minority that will never be pleased unless a game is EXACTLY how they want it to be.   <br />
<br />
I don't think I've ever seen so much complaining about a game pre-release as I have here.  To be honest I have to wonder if Blizzard's ballsy decision to drop the NDA so early was a good idea.   <br />
<br />
The game is in beta and they are still working out the kinks.  That includes with staffing.  If the guy is a dink and doesn't fit well into the team or the &quot;vision&quot; he will be released.  If he does fit in to how they picture things then so much the better.   Why don't we just wait and see?</div></div><hr />
