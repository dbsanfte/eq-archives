      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial">Here is ALL the relevant details on 
        non-quest mob targets in the Plane of Sky that I’ve been compiling over 
        the past few months. All the info up to Butterfly Isle is complete. <br>
        <br>
        All spawns are static, not aggro, do not wander, do not despawn, and do 
        not enrage unless otherwise noted. Expect normal HP, AC, and resists unless 
        otherwise noted. All mobs have a chance to drop rare items (such as Melee 
        Belts, Caster Bracers, Weight of the Gods, etc).<br>

        </font><font size=2><font size="5"><b><font color="#0066CC" size="4">Key 
        Master Isle</font></b></font></font></p>
      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial">Thunder Spirits (8 of them on Key Master 
        Isle, level 50) Look like Faeries, they hit for up to 160 and will proc 
        'Choke' on their target, which takes 10 strength off of their target and 
        does a small DoT. These are the easiest mobs you will find in Sky. They 
        randomly drop all types of Tesseras, three Mini-Swords and three Rabbits 
        Feet. Hand the Mini-Swords and Rabbits Feet to Sirran the Lunatic to receive 
        a Key of Swords and a Key of the Misplaced, respectively. <br>
        <br>
        Thunder Spirit Princess (Boss on Key Master Isle, level 53) Looks like 
        a Faerie, she hits for mid 200s and will proc 'Choke' on her target. Usually 
        empty, but will rarely have a piece of rare loot (Hast Belt, etc). Her 
        death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, upon giving him a 
        Mini-Sword or Rabbits Foot, will hand you a Key of Swords or a Key of 
        the Misplaced, respectively. <br>

      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial"> Azarack (9 on Azarack Isle, Aggro, 
        Wander, level 53) Looks like an Imp/Scareling, they hit for up to 190 
        and proc Whirlbolt (Levitate, Root, 400 dmg DoT) on their target. Relatively 
        low HP but strange spell resists (one half of the Azaracks are resistant 
        to cold, the other half to fire). They can be mezzed. They randomly drop 
        all types of Disc quest items, and 1-3 Broken Mirrors. Killing the Place-Holder 
        on this island (distinguishable by the fact that it hits for 220 instead 
        of 190) will spawn the Protector of Sky, the boss of the island. <br>
        <br>
        Protector of Sky (Boss of Azarack Isle, Aggro, level 55) A giant version 
        of his Azarack counterpart, he hits for 300s and procs Whirlbolt (Levi, 
        400 dmg DoT) on his target. Drops one rare item (Haste Belt, etc.), one 
        rare quest item, and 4 Broken Mirrors. His death triggers the spawn of 
        Sirran the Lunatic, who, upon giving him a Broken Mirror, will give you 
        a Key that will enable access to Gorgalosk Isle. He has a despawn time 
        of about 80 minutes.<br>

      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial"> Gorgalask (~ 4 on Gorgalosk Isle, 
        Wander, level 54-56) Looks like a Gorgon (tentacles coming off the head), 
        they hit for low 300s, and will proc a long stun spell on their target. 
        Drops one Animal Figurine, and globes as its main quest item. Enrages 
        towards the end of fight. <br>
        <br>
        Sprited Harpie (~ 4 on Gorgalosk Isle, Wander, level 54-56) Looks similar 
        to a Gorgon/Gorgalask (but has no tentacles on its head), they hit for 
        low 300s, have a low level necro pet, a 5-minute charge of Harm Touch, 
        and will cast/proc Screaming Terror and Cascading Darkness on their target. 
        Drops one Animal Figurine, and globes as its main quest item.<br>
        <br>
        Watchful Guard (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, Wander, level 55-56) Looks similar 
        to an Evil Eye, hit for low 300s, has an Enchanter pet, cast Enchanter 
        DD, an AoE mass dispell, and an AoE Gravity Flux (seems to cast this off 
        and on; some raids they will Grav Flux, others they won't). Drops one 
        Animal Figurine, and globes as its main quest item. <br>
        <br>
        Gusts of Wind/Crystalline Cloud (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 53) Looks 
        similar to an Air Elemental, hit for 200s, casts AirElemental Attack (Stun). 
        Drops one Animal Figurine, and globes as its main quest item.<br>
        <br>
        Shimmering Meteors (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 55) Looks similar to will 
        o' wisps, but red in color, they hit for low to mid 300s, and cast the 
        spell Knockback (target gets thrown backwards, away from the Meteor; always 
        fight inside the temple, or you will get thrown off the Isle). Drops one 
        globe item and possibly research materials. <br>
        <br>
        Avenging Gazer (Mini-Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 59) Similar to Watchful 
        Guards, hits for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a Watchful 
        Guard. Very high HP AC Resists. Drops one Animal Figurine.<br>
        <br>
        Heart Harpie (Mini-Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 58) Similar to Sprited 
        Harpies, hits for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a Sprited 
        Harpie. Very high HP AC Resists. Drops one Animal Figurine.<br>
        <br>
        Gorgalosk (Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 60) Looks like a Gorgalask, hits 
        for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a Gorgalask. Very high 
        HP AC Resists. Drops 4 Animal Figurines, one rare item (Haste Belt, etc), 
        and one rare quest item. Her death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, 
        who, when given an Animal Figurine, will give you a key to the Pegasus 
        Isle. Enrages towards the end of fight. <br>

      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial"> Bladestorm (2 on Noble Isle, Wander, 
        level 59-60) Looks like a cloud of swords, hit for low to mid 300s and 
        proc a spell that saps their targets Stamina. High HP, AC, and Resists. 
        Usually empty, but will rarely have an item (Haste Belt, etc). They guard 
        Noble Dojorn. Enrages toward the end of fight. <br>
        <br>
        Noble Dojorn (Efreeti Boss of Noble Isle, level 63) Looks like an Efreeti, 
        hits for 300s, casts an AoE DD spell, and has a DD random proc. Extremely 
        high HP, AC, and Resists. Drops Efreeti quest items, and Efreeti armor.

      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial">Soul/Essence Harvester (6 on Pegasus 
        Isle, Wander, level 52) Looks similar to a Griffon or Pegasus, respectively, 
        hits for high 200s and casts Whirl-till-you-Hurl (stun that spins you 
        in place). All Griffons are particularly vulnerable to fire-based spells, 
        and all Pegasi are vulnerable to magic-based spells. Drops statuettes 
        as its main quest item, and up to 4 Bird Whistles. 2 of these are the 
        placeholders for Ekim Nottap, who will despawn after about an hour, forcing 
        the Keeper of Souls to spawn. The death of the Harvesters trigger the 
        spawn of TWO Soul/Essence Carriers: <br>
        <br>
        Soul/Essence Carrier (Two to each Soul/Essence Harvester, level 54) Exactly 
        like the Soul/Essence Harvester, except they have higher HP AC Resists 
        and hit harder. It will despawn after about 80 minutes. Drops statuettes 
        as its main quest item. Its death triggers the spawn of ONE Soul/Essence 
        Tamer: <br>
        <br>
        Soul/Essence Tamer (One to each Soul/Essence Carrier, level 56) Exactly 
        like the Soul/Essence Carrier, except they have even higher HP AC Resists 
        and hit for around 300. Drops statuettes as its main quest item. It will 
        despawn after about 80 minutes. Enrages towards the end of fight. <br>
        <br>
        Keeper of Souls (Boss of Pegasus Isle, Aggro, level 58+) Spawns when Ekim 
        Nottap despawns. Looks like a giant Pegasus (the size of a dragon, in 
        fact), hits for 400+, casts Whirl-till-you-Hurl, and Death Touches. Drops 
        one rare item (Haste belt, etc.), one rare quest item, and 4 Bird Whistles. 
        Its death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given a 
        Bird Whistle, will give you a Key enabling access to the Spiroc Isle. 
        It has a despawn time of about 80 minutes. Enrages towards the end of 
        fight. <br>
        <br>
        Overseer of Air (Efreeti Boss of Pegasus Isle, level 63) Spawns when Noble 
        Dojorn dies. Looks like an Efreeti, he can hit for up to 750, casts an 
        AoE DD, randomly procs a DD, and Death Touches. He also dual wields daggers, 
        which need to be disarmed at the beginning of the fight or he'll be able 
        to quad attack. Extremely high HP, AC, Resists. Drops Efreeti quest items 
        and Efreeti armor. His death triggers the spawn of the Hand of Veeshan 
        on the Butterfly Isle. <br>
        <br>
        </font><font size=2><font size="4"><b><font color="#0066CC">Spiroc Isle</font></b></font></font></p>
      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial"> Spiroc Arbiter, Banisher, Caller, 
        Walker, Expulser, and Revolter: <br>
        (6 on Spiroc Isle, Aggro, Wander, level 52) Look like colorful Aviaks, 
        they hit for 200, cast Lightning, an unresistable AoE, Blind, and Root. 
        Drops Spiroc feathers as its main quest item. Each of these Rooks are 
        tied together in pairs (Arbiter & Banisher, Caller & Walker, Expulser 
        & Revolter), and these pairs are in turn associated with the Vanquisher 
        that roams around them (they roam around their individual ‘houses’ in 
        these pairs). The associated Vanquisher must be killed before the pairs 
        of Rooks can be killed, otherwise the Rooks will respawn. The Rooks can 
        be mezzed quite easily. Very large yell-for-help radius.<br>
        <br>
        Spiroc Vanquisher (3 on Spiroc Isle, Aggro, Wander, level 58) A bit tougher 
        than the Rooks, Spiroc Vanquishers wander near to its associated Rook 
        pairs. These must be killed before the Rook pairs can be killed. They 
        drop 8 Noise Makers that enable access to Bzzazzt Isle. Enrages towards 
        the end of fight. <br>
        <br>
        Spiroc Guardian (Mini-Boss of Spiroc Isle, Aggro, level 60) A larger version 
        of his Spiroc counterparts, casts similar spells, and drops two quest 
        components. It hits for up to 250. (Enrages? Can’t remember) <br>
        <br>
        Spiroc Lord (Boss of Spiroc Isle, Aggro, level 63) An even larger version 
        of the Spirocs, this is the boss of Spiroc Isle. It hits for 350+, DTs, 
        casts an unresistable AoE spell, StoneSpiderStuns, Roots, and Blinds enemies. 
        Drops 4 Noise Makers, as well as one rare item and one rare quest component. 
        Its death will trigger the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given 
        a Noise Maker, will give you a Key that will enable access to the Bzzazzt 
        Isle. (Enrages? Can’t remember) <br>
        <br>
        </font><font size=2><font size="4"><b><font color="#0066CC">Bzzazzt Isle</font></b></font></font></p>
      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial"> Bzzazzt (3 on Bzzazzt Isle, Aggro, 
        level 50) Look like Wasps from newbie zones, hit for 390, and cast Deadly 
        Poison (1200 DoT) spell on target. Not very magic resistant, and can be 
        mezzed easily (and charmed too with some work). Huge aggro radius, and 
        only safe spot on the island is behind the big gear. Each Bzzazzt drops 
        8 Dull Dragon Scales, which enable access to Drake Isle. Main quest items 
        for this island are ‘Honey’-type items. <br>
        <br>
        (Note: All other spawns after the initial Bzzazzt seem to be completely 
        magic resistant except for Lure-type spells, and ALL of the other spawns 
        Enrage towards the end of the fight, which sucks especially since they 
        all hit for 500+ heh. They have a huge aggro radius, but you can still 
        do CR on the island with the splits spawned to get another try at them 
        if you have a wipe-out. Beware though, the splits (including the final 
        boss) have a despawn timer of 80 minutes, so be quick) <br>
        <br>
        Left Bzzazzt (when facing them from behind), when killed, spawns 2 level 
        55 Bazzzazzts (hit for 500s), and each of their deaths will spawn a level 
        57 Bizazzt (hit for 700s) (Note: this is just like the spawn cycle for 
        Pegasi/Griffons from Pegasus Isle). <br>
        <br>
        Right Bzzazzt, when killed, spawns 3 level 55 Bazzzazzts at once. <br>
        <br>
        Middle Bzzazzt, when killed, spawns 1 level 55 Bazzzazzt, who's death 
        triggers the spawn of the level 60 Bzzt (a bixie, hits for 700s), who's 
        death triggers the spawn of the final boss, the level 63 Bazzt Zzzt (another 
        bixie, hits for 850, DTs, has an island-covering AoE *disease* spell), 
        for a grand total of 2 Wasps, 2 Bixies for the Middle Bzzazzt. The death 
        of the Bazzt Zzt will trigger the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when 
        given a Dull Dragon Scale, will give you a Key that will enable access 
        to the Drake Isle. **VERY** important: This instance of Sirran the Lunatic, 
        when given the proper phrase, will spawn the Sister of the Spire on Drake 
        Isle. You *must* give this phrase, or your progress in the Plane of Sky 
        will be halted at the next island. The proper phrase is not hard to discern 
        if you’ve been going to Sky for some time…just look back at your past 
        conversations with Sirran and you should be able to figure it out based 
        on his past clues.<br>

      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial"> Heartsbane Drake (~5 on Drake Isle, 
        Wander, level 56) Look like black drakes; they are the weakest of the 
        Drakes on this Isle and should be pulled after all Fatestealers are cleared. 
        They hit for high 400s, proc a spell similar to Whirlbolt (Levitate, Whirl-till-you-Hurl, 
        possible DD or DoT), and cast Wizard spells. Very low HPs and low resists. 
        Each Drake drops a Replica of the Wurm Queen, which enable access to Butterfly 
        Isle. Drop final item to Efreeti Quests as their main quest drop. <br>
        <br>
        Fatestealer Drakes (~5 on Drake Isle, Wander, level 58) Look like green 
        drakes; they should be pulled first, before the other 2 sets of Drakes. 
        They hit for low 400s, proc a spell similar to Whirlbolt (Levitate, Whirl-till-you-Hurl, 
        possible DD or DoT), and cast Wizard spells. Significantly more HP than 
        the Heartsbane Drakes, and seemingly resistant to all spells, including 
        the Lure line. Each Drake drops a Replica of the Wurm Queen, which enable 
        access to Butterfly Isle. Drop final item to Efreeti Quests as their main 
        quest drop. <br>
        <br>
        Windrider Drake (~5 on Drake Isle, Wander, level 60) Look like pretty 
        blue drakes; they are the most powerful of the mobs on Drake Isle and 
        should be pulled last (and due to their roaming paths around the temple, 
        some are bugged and next to un-pullable). They hit for high 500s, proc 
        a spell similar to Whirlbolt (Levitate, Whirl-till-you-Hurl, possible 
        DD or DoT), and cast Wizard spells. Very high HP and Resists. Each Drake 
        drops a Replica of the Wurm Queen, which enable access to Butterfly Isle. 
        Drop final item to Efreeti Quests as their main quest drop. <br>
        <br>
        Greater Sphinx (7 on Drake Isle, level 54) Look like giant sphinxes, they 
        are assembled in pairs around the temple. They hit for high 300s, cast 
        Enchanter spells, and Death Touch. They have an extremely small yell-for-help 
        range, thus they won’t aggro the other Sphinxes when you pull one. Each 
        Sphinx drops a Replica of the Wurm Queen, which enable access to Butterfly 
        Isle. Drop final item to Efreeti Quests as their main quest drop. <br>

        Undine Spirit (8 on Drake Isle, level 53) Cleric wisp, found inside the 
        ceiling of the temple, above the Sister spawn point. Not yet engaged, 
        need info on them.<br>
        <br>
        Sister of the Spire (Boss of Drake Isle, Aggro, level 63) A spawn triggered 
        by Sirran from Bzzazzt Isle, she looks like the female Efreeti Mage pets. 
        She can be found inside the temple, and is aggro (but very small aggro 
        range). She hits for 200s, casts an AoE stun spell, and Death Touches. 
        Very high HP AC and Resists. Her death will trigger the spawn of Sirran 
        the Lunatic, who, when given a Replica of the Wurm Queen, will give you 
        Veeshan’s Key that will enable access to the Butterfly Isle (this key 
        seems to be the exact same one you can buy from the Key Master for 1cp 
        that enables access to the Quest Room). Enrages towards the end of fight.<br>

      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial"> Eye of Veeshan (1 on Butterfly Isle, 
        level 63) Looks like a cute butterfly, supposed boss of the entire Plane 
        of Sky, or at least the trigger for something even bigger. Hits for 173 
        max, procs the Efreeti DD on almost every hit (“You feel your soul being 
        consumed”), and Death Touches. Not yet engaged in a real fight.<br>
        <br>
        Hand of Veeshan (1 on Butterfly Isle, level 63) Triggered by the death 
        of the Overseer of Air, he’s the final step in the line of Efreetis. Not 
        yet engaged.<br>

      <p><font size=2 face="Verdana,Arial">There you have it folks. The last islands’ 
        info is a bit bare since we’ve never actually fought there...but that’ll 
        change soon ;) And also note that none of this info comes from ShowEQ, 
        just from months and months of raiding my favorite zone in EQ =P Thanks 
        to the people that contributed, too many to name. </font></p>
