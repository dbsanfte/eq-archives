      <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We 
        recently had the opportunity to ask some questions from one of Verant's 
        recent acquisitions, John Capozzi (aka Kendrick). </font></div>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        You've recently taken a position at Verant. What exactly do you do there? 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        My title is Associate Cabana Boy. I am tasked with mixing frozen tropical 
        confections, changing towels, keeping the strange floating objects out 
        of the pool, and being extra nice to the female octogenarian guests. Oh, 
        wait. That was my old job. My NEW job is Associate Game Designer, EQ Live. 
        What that means is that instead of creating drinks and playing a lot of 
        shuffleboard, I create content and play a lot of shuffleboard. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Now that the world of EQ has been stabilized for awhile, did the game 
        turn out the way you thought it would be? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        I had a pretty clear picture how the game would be early in beta. I didn't 
        expect that it would be quite this popular, we're getting close to half 
        a million units sold now, which is pretty damned impressive. Just like 
        anyone else who plays the game, I can find things to fault about EQ, but 
        if you step back and look at the game as a whole, it's a masterpiece. 
        And we are working hard to correct a lot of those perceived faults. EQ 
        isn't done yet and that is one of the great things about it. As long as 
        we can keep power to the servers, we can improve the game, and fully intend 
        to. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Can you tell us anything about the upcoming Rogue uber-weapon (ie: the 
        Rogue Fiery Avenger)? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Well, yes, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. I can say 
        that all the class quests are in the final stages of testing at this time. 
        That means they will be in..soon. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Do you agree that many of the planes items are quite underpowered with 
        the addition of so many easier to obtain Kunark items? Any chance that 
        any of these items might get an upgrade?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        That's a given. We've got Velious to get out the door first, then we fully 
        intend to go back in and retune the Planes. That includes the difficulty 
        of the ultimate encounters in there, as well as revamping the equipment. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Are there any plans to make 'Detect Traps' more applicable? For example, 
        identifying floor traps? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        We've got an idea we're working on right now that will make Sense and 
        Disarm Traps work just like a player would expect. And traps to use them 
        on. Game wide. How's that for a teaser? ;) </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Are you saying they are going to actually be ADDING traps to the current 
        world? Will they be changing the few current ones to actually do damage? 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        We've rethought the concept of traps, or rather, someone here had an epiphany 
        that should make traps do what they traditionally do in RPG's. It's still 
        in the concept stage at this point, but to partially answer you question, 
        Sense Traps will sense traps and disarm traps will disarm traps, and traps 
        will be a lot more..dynamic. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Would there ever be a chance to change the 'consideration' command to 
        accurately report if a mob can see you or not? For example, why would 
        a mob be 'scowling' at me if he can't even see me? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        It is a quirk with the way factions are set up. Factions work on yours 
        and the target's race, in addition to any faction assigned to the mob. 
        Any mob tagged &quot;no faction&quot; will tend to scowl even if they 
        can't see you. We can't go through and change all &quot;no faction&quot; 
        to some faction, for a number of reasons. Besides, to me, it's one of 
        the cooler parts of mastering the class, learning what can and can't see 
        you. There should be no absolutes. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Will 'apply poison' ever be changed to a 'time based' skill instead of 
        a 'failure' skill? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Apply will most likely remain the way it is from now on. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Any chance for having more than just the standard stat modifiers for weapons 
        or armor? I would enjoy seeing a weapon with a 'Attack + 15' or a shield 
        with 'Defense + 10'. Other suggestions could include 'Movement + 15' or 
        'Piercing + 5'. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        That is an idea I like too, and brought up a few times. The system doesn't 
        really support direct skill boosts via equipment, and would be very difficult 
        to implement. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        Is everquest ever thinking about a 'Everquest Newsletter' or something 
        that will describe ongoing GM quests? I still don't understand the entire 
        storylines on the 'Lifting of the Veil' for Kunark, nor the connection 
        between the Plane of Fear, Lanys T'Vil and Kithicor Forest. And with Velious 
        coming up, I would like to understand what is happening. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        I'm with you on that 100 percent. One of those faults I mentioned above, 
        to my mind, was the limited depth to the world, and no real place to go 
        for a good solid dose of backstory. Keep an eye on the Everquest.com webpage, 
        there should be more content in the near future that will address a lot 
        of the above. And we're working hard on making the world more vivid while 
        ingame, with expanded dialogues, more &quot;local color&quot;, and an 
        ever increasing staff of Quest Troupe members to further animate the game. 
        I feel strongly that if you &quot;live&quot; in Norrath, there should 
        be a wealth of information available for you to absorb, just to ground 
        you in the world. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">[Safehouse]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        What are your thoughts on &quot;twinking&quot;? For example, a level 5 
        Rogue decked out in full ravenscale wielding a Trak tooth. Can anything 
        be done about it? Or should anything be done at all? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#00FF00">[Kendrick]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
        I don't like twinking. But twinking is not going to go away. That's about 
        all I can say. </font></p>
