<br />
I have collected 3 nodrop symbols so far. 1 from tactics, 1 from Berts kings, 1 from Mithaniels named guards. I assume one drops in sol ros lair but have yet to see one drop. They are fairly rare from what I have seen. Anyone have any info on what they might be for?<br />

<br />
we have cast identify on them, checked a few other websites/messageboards for info and no additional information has been obtained about the orgin/purpose.  <br />
<br />
off the top of my head, guildmates that have looted them have tried talking/handing them to adler near pod, the librarian in pok, and a few other npcs in tranquility and pok.. but nada.<br />

There's 3-4 tents, surrounded by a low wooden fence, there are valorian sentries (4 of them) parked around the outside.<br />

Inside the tents are various named guys, captains, sergeants and such.  They were all indifferent to my agnostic human monk, and all responded to hails.  Here's some of my log.<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 01 07:00:38 2003] You say, 'Hail, Sergeant Gerrin Bakeside'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 07:00:39 2003] Sergeant Gerrin Bakeside says 'Greetings Soldier.  I'm sorry, if you've come for weapons, what you see here is only for use by the army of Marr. Right now we are not accepting new recruits into [Ducee Lealson.]'<br />

Fyking, Fellon, Rydric, and myself are renowned through these areas for our skill in battle.

I managed to get the same from them, but strangely enough, I didnt get any info from them before after a while. Maybe I said something that triggered them to talk. Dont know though. Couldnt get them to reply after naming all the ducee coins. NPCs in valor also has the bad habit of eating items, so kinda risky to just give the items to someone there.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fatsow99</div><div class="date">02-02-03, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like pretty much everyone in Valor eat items.<br />
<br />
Have been looking at the key quest for Aerin'Dar.<br />
<br />
www.salo.bz/ragbert/key-aerindar.html<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I cant seem to finish this, since I already have access to Halls of Honor. The quest seems to stop at Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln.<br />
<br />
What I find interresting is what Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says in the end about their main purpose, which he wont tell exactly, and which war they are fighting.<br />
<br />
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Unfortunately, that is one of the things that I'm unable to speak of at this time. However, if you are [willing] to help rally some people together I may be able to release some more information to you.' <br />
<br />
Havent seen any reference to a reply to &quot;I am willing&quot;, and what he means by rally some people. Is this in connection to Aerin'Dar or possible something with the Ducee coins?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tjen</div><div class="date">02-02-03, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really want ot figure this one out.<br />
<br />
This is what I've come up with so far: Ducee seems ot be a name for sometinhg like a &quot;Squad&quot; in Marr's army. The men in the camp that talk to you are of &quot;Ducee Lealson.&quot; Symbols of Ducee only drop in HoHb, off the Guards of Marr himself or off guards of other gods that Marr is at war with. This is probably why there isn't one in Sol Ro or Bot; Marr isn't at war with Karana or Sol Ro. If this is true then it's likely  differnent squads of &quot;Ducee&quot; were sent against Bert, Saryrn, and Rallos. It seems they all failed and that is why guards of the gods have thier symbols.<br />
<br />
We tried killing a few mobs in the camp in PoV to see if we could get another symbol off them but got nothing.<br />
<br />
I hope this information helps lead to the meaning behind these symbols. As is it right now, no one even knows where this quest would start or who gives it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fatsow99</div><div class="date">02-03-03, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets see, we have 3 Ducee 'squads' in Valor as far as I can tell.<br />
This is:<br />
- Ducee lealson(Sergeant Gerrin Bakeside)<br />
- Ducee Tapferson(Paralin Notion)<br />
- Ducee Buled(Captain Ryglot Cupperhide)<br />
<br />
<br />
These 3 are probably a part of Che Virtuson.<br />
<br />
Some logs:<br />
<br />
what mission<br />
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Well, I can't go into any details as to our main purpose is, but one of our missions was to exterminate the crystalline dragon. However, due to our company being split we are unable to go forward with this part of the operation. It has been placed on hold, pending the outcome of the [war].'<br />
<br />
what war<br />
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Unfortunately, that is one of the things that I'm unable to speak of at this time. However, if you are [willing] to help rally some people together I may be able to release some more information to you.'<br />
<br />
And what is their main purpose?  He doesnt seem to be willing to tell anything even if you have slain Aerin'Dar.<br />
<br />
Ducee doesnt exist in any dictionary, so im pretty sure these ducee coins have something to do with these ducee in valor. The coins seems to hint at other squads, that might have gone out hunting for some bosses.<br />
<br />
Tjen, you absolutely positive there is ducee coins dropping in hohb? I cant remember or find any in my logs, either can I find it searching magelos or lucys database. Only 3 I can find in both are Ducee Fideson(CoD), Ducee Cupidon(Torment) and Ducee Imperon(Tactics).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tjen</div><div class="date">02-03-03, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I am not absolutly positive but I'm pretty sure I remember them dropping one and others in this thread have said the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_IceIsFun</div><div class="date">02-03-03, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I recall correctly, Mithaniel Marr worshippers are very non-kos in HoH-B provided they haven't killed anything in HoH-A or HoH-B. There are 4(?) red-con named NPCs in the side rooms of the entrance. Perhaps that would be a good place to check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fatsow99</div><div class="date">02-03-03, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, pretty much impossible to get a guildie to check that then. Can ofcourse get some non guildies into hohb now with the new system. Also, the faction Battalion of Marr bottomed out for me after killing 2 entrance mobs in hoh. That means, that I either took HUGE faction hits, or probably more likely, this faction is capped. If its capped, does that mean its someway to raise it? Since I dont see much reason to cap it, unless it is.<br />
<br />
I wonder if Ducee Imperon might also drop in hohb? Edited by: Fatsow99 at: 2/3/03 10:24:58 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tjen</div><div class="date">02-03-03, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty hard to get to HoHb without killign any mobsin HoH. I am a Mithaniel Marr cleric so by what you said I should have started pretty damn high in the faction but all mobs in HoHa were kos upon entering and we had to do trials to get to HoHb so I took a lot of hits before getting in HoHb. I wonder if there is a way to fix this faction, then it's possible you have to hand in the symbols to Marr himself, or some other mob in HoHb but that would probably mean the Symbol off Marrs guards is the same as one of the others since you'de have to kill mobs on the faction of the quest you are doign to get an item for it... that would be kinda rediculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wanyen</div><div class="date">02-04-03, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It won't be to MM himself as he is untargetable while the room is fully spawned, if it's anything in HohB.. it will be either:<br />
<br />
a) the small named armors/humans in the little side rooms towards the front of the temple of Marr<br />
b) the named guards *in* Marr's room<br />
<br />
i would strongly suspect, again, if in fact there is anything in HohB that wants those symbols, it will be option &quot;a&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tjen</div><div class="date">02-04-03, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked my logs. Although I am a Mith Marr cleric, it took only 2 hits to bottom my Battalion of Marr faction and nothing I have ever done has raised it. If there is a turn in, it probably won't be in HoHb, or HoHa because the only things not kos in HoHa are the triggers for the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Baydin</div><div class="date">02-04-03, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we have coin drops on an &quot;ultra rare&quot; droprate from raid size (well 3-4 group+) mobs... I'd expect something good to come of this.  While it could be just another single person quest for one of the zones, the scale of mobs and tier of the associated planes would make that one mean zoneflag for a single person... so we can likely rule that out.  Magelo still only lists 3, so if you have one of these buggers, check it against Magelo, If theres 4 total, that would make for an easy turnin, just a matter of who.  Considering the distribution, It;s concievable to expect a guild as a whole to have accumulated a set of these by the time they reach &quot;the endgame&quot; for the expansion. perhaps well find a use for them there. -Bay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tjen</div><div class="date">02-04-03, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another theory I came up with is this *might* be an alternate quest to get into elemental planes... or just Sol Ro. It sounds unlikely cause it's pretty obvious they want you to kill a good deal of  PoP gods to get in these zones but, there are quests to flag for otehr pop zones without killing the big flag mob. And considering where and what these drop off of, and how rare they are, it's possible.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Cleric of Inny and the suits hate me, the gaurds are indifferent.  The trials don't involve any faction hits that I'm aware of.  I haven't checked HoHb factions but I bet I'm KoS even without having killed anything.  Marr is just an @#%$.<br />
 <br />
  Checked mobs in HoHb and they're indifferent but they don't turn on hail and they eat anything given to them.  Just another killing field, move along. Edited by: L1ndara at: 4/13/03 7:58:08 pm</div></div><hr />

She was apprehensive to all mobs in HoH-A (except the 66+ mobs which corpse camp), and all mobs in HoH-B. Further, all of the trials may be done without killing trash mobs of the zone. Later, I killed a single mob in HoH-A, which immediately took her faction to scowls.</div></div><hr />

This is a possibility, but the coins they are looking for are from GM events, it's unlikely that they'd be looking for these too.  Definitely worth a try though.</div></div><hr />

Since it seems like you have to kill some pretty heavy duty stuff I'm thinking the reward might be decent.  My guild has gotten 2 Symbols of Ducee Fideson during the Bert cycle now and I'm hoping to see this solved.<br />
<br />
So far this is what has been found according to this thread, but this info is old now.  <br />
<br />
Symbol of Ducee Fideson - Crypt of Decay Kings during Bert Cycle<br />
Symbol of Ducee Imperon - Tactics from Hinvat Deathbringer and Anival the Blade<br />
Symbol of Ducee Cupidon - Torment from The Keeper of Sorrows and Baraguj Szuul <br />
Symbol of Ducee ? &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp - Temple of MM named guards ?<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm the Symbol drop in HoHb and fill in the Ducee name?  <br />

I handed a symbol into a quest mob in Rathe mountains.  He is a green to 65 cleric named Tabien the goodly.  He is of Marr.  He asks for you to kill bertox and bring proof of his demise.  The only none gear proof of Bertox demise are the symbols that drop along the way.  I was apprehensive on my cleric and he gave me the bad breathe/slime like you messages.  I gave the symbol anyway(bertkings/bert).  He ate it.  He brandishes and talks of a shield and protecting it...<br />
<br />
Was able to get him to reveal the quest to a 65 chanter.<br />
<br />
Fyi why I noobed the quest.  I play on SZ deity alliance server.  I am evil aligned de cleric.  Was unsure of faction raising quest and did not want to hurt my home city faction.(yeah being a faction wuss).  <br />

<br />
P.S.  From Feerott head down passed the beatles and take the right fork.  Keep wall on right and be close to it.  Is a rectangular stone that Tabien camps out stairing at.  He is down a little ways from the fork.  Sorry no loc.</div></div><hr />

Bertoxxulous drops &quot;Symbol of the Plaguebringer&quot;, which is far more likely to be the item he is looking for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_GreysLuclin</div><div class="date">07-03-03, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas, some food for thought here.<br />
<br />
I was in HoH poking around before a raid, the other day, and it seems there is an event that I have not read about having been found out how to trigger yet.<br />
<br />
If you are a new person to HoH A or B, over half the mobs are not KoS to you.  The suits are, but the humans, cats, and undead are not KoS at all.  You can walk around anywhere in there, if you are careful and use invis / camo when near the KoS mobs.  Kill 1 or 2 things in HoH A or B, and you are KoS to what was indiff before.<br />
<br />
When you zone in, and go thru the first archway, there is a huge statue of MM.  The area around it is divided into 4 parts, all surrounded by hedges that only have 1 way through to each area.  In each area are Humans.  If you stand near Seargent Bransid (I think it is) he gives a speech to his troops, if you wait long enough, which gets logged by the journal.  Also near the statue, there is an entrance to a 5th area facing the HoH B zone portal, with a building in it, and guards sitting around under trees and a few practicing sparring who reform ranks then go back to sparring, etc, in a loop.<br />
<br />
In the NW hedge is Sergeant Gauswick and 4 “A Valorian Guardian”s<br />
<br />
In the SW  hedge is Sergeant Hurrid and 5 “Imperion Servicemen”<br />
<br />
In the NE hedge area, Sgt. Bransid says the following –<br />
<br />
---Sergeant Bransid says 'Welcome members of Ducee Inston.'<br />
---Sergeant Bransid says 'As you can see many fellow members of Che Decuson are no longer with us.  A few groups have been asked to stay behind to learn specialized tactics of warfare.'<br />
---Sergeant Bransid says 'All of you here have been chosen as the elite members of Ducee Inston.  The next several weeks we'll all be involved in intense training.  The Guardians of Honor will safeguard the Halls.  This will allow us to keep focused with the tasks at hand.'<br />
---Sergeant Bransid says 'The preparations have begun.  Che Virtuson has already been dispatched to a remote region outside of our home plane, as many of you may already know.  Che Decuson has been given the task of safeguarding the halls while our numbers are diminished.'<br />
---Sergeant Bransid says 'War is upon us.  We've received reports that Che Virtuson has already engaged in battle.  Che Decuson has already begun to deploy members of Alto Bellumon and Alto Roburon to destination Alphite Siegrun.'<br />
---Sergeant Bransid says 'The mausoleums will remain heavily guarded.  They will continue to function as usual.  However, no members of Che Decuson or Che Virtuson will be allowed to take the Trials of Marr.  The trials will resume once everyone has returned.'<br />
---Sergeant Bransid says 'Our lord has asked that we all meditate before we begin our intense training.  At this time please hold all questions.  Please be seated and think only of our mission, of our lord, and of our fellow brethren.'<br />
<br />
In the SE hedge is the event that has not been triggerable yet, as far as I know, on any server.  There is a Sergeant Baerson, 2 guards, Guard Eteric and Guard Fali, and an untargetable An Ogre Mauler.  As in PoS, the Lords are untargetable until certain actions happen (clearing all that area of giants).  In PoI, the MB is untargetable until the swarmlings are prevented from entering for 10 minutes.  There has to be some action to take to get the Ogre Targetable, and I would think because the ogre is behind 2 guards, it is a trial of sorts, as the ogre cons red on track to a level 65.<br />
<br />
As people are not KoS to the humans in HoH A or B, and also not to the undead, the phrase that Sft Bransid uses “The mausoleums will remain heavily guarded.  They will continue to function as usual.,” means to me there is more to do in there, than try to fight the undead with the killer HP / mana drain DoT, and with no drops I have heard reported from them for little exp for the effort.<br />
<br />
In PoValor, there is a wandering spirit in the GY.  He has a quest for drops from the vassals.  I tried this to see if it gave faction, and it did not.<br />
---A Wandering Spirit groans in extreme anguish.  '[Help] me.'<br />
---A Wandering Spirit says 'My resting grounds have been desecrated.  I now lie awake unable to rest with my fellow brethren.  My soul is bound to this area for all of eternity.  Until my [belongings] are brought back I cannot rest.'<br />
---A Wandering Spirit says 'Many different things were taken, but I'm mainly concerned with my [amulet] and my family's crescent symbol.  Bring these articles back into my possession and I'll return back to my state of rest.'<br />
---A Wandering Spirit says 'The amulet was given to me after passing the Trials many many generations ago.  It is a part of every soldier who has passed the trials, it is a part of my very being.'<br />
<br />
Get the two medallions, one each from the two undead areas to the two sides of the GY, where the ruined buildings are.<br />
<br />
---A Wandering Spirit quickly grabs the amulet and crescent symbol before speaking.  'At long last!  I can now rest in peace along with my fellow brethren.  Thank you Greys.  May the might of Marr follow you wherever you may go.'<br />
<br />
I was told a few low-level things can be returned, and they are all no drop, but I did not get one, so cannot confirm that.  I am not sure if the returned things would have any use in the mausoleums.  The reason is the same as with the way SoE phrased putting the exterminators in starting cities, to get new players used to the format in which the game is played, questing.  He might be there as a quest in PoV so when you get to HoH other undead quests might be found.<br />
<br />
To further this read from PoV –<br />
<br />
---Sergeant Gerrin Bakeside says 'Greetings Soldier.  I'm sorry; if you've come for weapons, what you see here is only for use by the army of Marr.  Right now we are not accepting new recruits into [Ducee Lealson.]'<br />
---Sergeant Gerrin Bakeside says 'We are Ducee Lealson, Ducee Lealson is Loyalty!  Fyking, Fellon, Rydric, and myself are renowned through these areas for our skill in battle.  Each man in Ducee Lealson is not only willing to die for his compatriots, but he considers it an [honor.]'<br />
---Sergeant Gerrin Bakeside says 'Yes, we go where the Hand of Honor points us.  Live or die, to serve is an honor.  We do not fear our own demise, everyone dies, the men of Ducee Lealson die with honor.'<br />
(One of the soldiers goes on about hating guarding weapons, when he is a soldier.)<br />
---Sergeant Gerrin Bakeside says 'Enough soldier!  You will serve as it is seen fit to have you serve, the honor of Ducee Lealson does not fade once we leave the battlefield.  Your father knew that, you would do well to take after him more.'<br />
<br />
His father might be in the HoH mausoleum.<br />
<br />
Also –<br />
<br />
Sergeant Amon Tillan says 'Well met, Greys.  Do you hear the call of honor as these brave soldiers I teach do?  You would do well to learn from the lessons of your ancestors, for valor is its own reward.'<br />
<br />
A mausoleum is a crypt, or where dead people are placed.  I almost think it clues to ‘learning a lesson’ from the undead in HoH.  The mausoleum has to be used for something.  As Baerson said, ‘..  the Mausoleums will continue to function as usual.”<br />
<br />
A post from Safehouse is as follows for the A Wandering Spirit –<br />
<br />
***You can either hand him both amulets from the skels, amulet of rhaj and necklace of marr or something, or you can hand him the sword of unwavering faith and shield of unwavering faith to get XP. The amulets give pretty much 0 XP, and the shield/sword gave some if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Edit: btw the named Lieutenants drop the sword/shield.<br />
<br />
After that a human spawns, but he gives the same quest..so I dunno. ***<br />
<br />
Dunno if the human would be a different quest at a later time, as a human.  Just a tho’t.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I would think there might be a side quest of some sort with the Cartographers.  The Razorfiend Subjugator drops the cartographer’s quill and ink bottle.  In the 2nd castle in PoV, there are 2 an apprentice cartographers, and a named that is looking over maps.  The apprentices respond, but at this time, the named does not.  These could tie in.<br />
<br />
Ducee seems to mean squad, Che like a batallion or higher sized unit.  There are 3 or 4 symbols of Ducees found in other zones, as well.  Prior post says someone got one off of the MM Champions, but never said what it was, and no one else confirmed.<br />
<br />
Ducee Cupidon symbol found in Torment off KoS and Baraguj<br />
Ducee Imperon symbol found in PoTactics off higher level named going to any Zek.<br />
Ducee Fideson symbol found in CoD during Bert event off named.<br />
Ducee &amp;lt;?&gt; symbol found in HoHb off MM Champions ???<br />
<br />
If it can be figured out how to trigger the Ogre Mauler event, then I am sure it will start HoH quests that have not been discovered yet.  Just have to try with people that have not become KoS yet.  The AD key spoiler says that if you have to hail  Paralin Notion twice, then go straight to the next NPC without zoning or hailing anything any other NPC first, in something like a military fashion.  Never having done the AD key quest, I cannot comfirm this, tho, but many NPCs in PoV will only respond once.  It will prolly be hard to find out the trigger for the Ogre Mauler if that is any indication of what it would take.<br />
<br />
Just keep in mind 2 Che’s are referenced, and the Captain of one is in PoV, the other I don’t know about yet.  Being KoS sucks at times, and I wish I had not apped to a raiding guild as flagging was happening, heh.  Keep posing as you get more info.<br />

<br />
Sort of a waste, to totally ignore a whole zone of quests.<br />
<br />
Consider that level 62 is needed to get in, prolly some real nice returns from HoHa, and HoHb.<br />
<br />
Also note that doing the Trials does not in any way give faction adjustments, positive or negative.  HoHb access can still be gotten without fighting in to Mith Marr, I expect.  Just have to figure out how. ? Edited by: GreysLuclin at: 8/22/03 6:07 am</div></div><hr />

Unfinished or broken content seems the most likely explanation (remember, they dropped the Plane of War late in development - might have been a tie-in there).<br />
<br />
Red Mob in HoHB DOES eat the coin tho.</div></div><hr />

Didnt trigger Ogre Mauler. Although, if you pull some mob inside the ogre mauler room, the 2 trainees agros you. They will attack you and you cant attack back. If you keep them engaged for a while/kited, the Sergeant in the ogre room will depop. Most likely due to a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me that many of the PoP quests are given out by mobs in either PoTranquility or PoKnowledge.  Has anyone tried going around to all the PoT and PoK mobs, hailing them, and saying &quot;What Symbol of Ducee Imperon?&quot; and &quot;What Symbol of Ducee?' and so on?<br />
<br />
Might give us some leads at least.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Defy Logic</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too have aquired all 3 coins and have put some effort forth into this quest.  I took a raid force of 60-70 (on our way to hit MM) and cleared the entire front of HoHa to the GY, pulling the entire hedge quadrant at a time and burning them down as fast as possible, got all 3 targetable quadrants cleared including all black metals in the area before repops &amp;amp; nothing happened.  I sat in the brawler hedge &amp;amp; waited for script or event or anything to happen while the raid was finishing off the last of the mobs.  They simply repeated their loop the sargeant saying something &amp;amp; they snap to attention, then shortly after they go beat on the brawler for a few sec &amp;amp; return to the front.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes the black metals at the front started to repop so I grabbed a couple and kited them through the brawler area to get them to assist aggro as mentioned above.  The 2 named warriors aggrod but the brawler and the sargeant stayed &amp;amp; didnt react.  Brought the suits &amp;amp; named untargetables to the raid at the GY hoping we could somehow figure a way to dps the untargetables down.  We couldnt get anything to work.  Riposte disc, PBAE, Rains, pets, nothing seemed to drop their HP although we would get hits to land from melee ripostes &amp;amp; etc.  While the raid was trying to figure it out and keep the healers alive I went back to the brawler area &amp;amp; the sargeant was despawned.  After a while we gave up, had people zone aggro &amp;amp; send them back to spawn.<br />
<br />
A couple ideas or possibilities.<br />
<br />
The Sargeant in the adjacent hedge seems to be the most likely candidate to have pertinent information to this event.<br />
<br />
In the NE hedge area, Sgt. Bransid says the following –<br />
<br />
---Sergeant Bransid says 'The mausoleums will remain heavily guarded. They will continue to function as usual. However, no members of Che Decuson or Che Virtuson will be allowed to take the Trials of Marr. The trials will resume once everyone has returned.'<br />
<br />
In my opinion the &quot;mausoleums&quot; that he is referring to are the 3 trial houses.  <br />
<br />
One thing that has been tested to hold true twice now, once by my own personal experience, is that when the 2 untargetable named guards in the brawler hedge are aggro kited out of their area and kept away for an unknown amount of time (my guess just a minute or 2 as I only spent about 5 minutes at camp trying to figure out the untargetables before going to check on the brawler) the Sargeant in the in the brawler hedge DEPOPS, possibly he REPOPS in another area?  (such as the trial houses &quot;mausoleums&quot;)  Thus spawning another set of trials or events?  I seriously doubt that you would have to clear all 3 hedges to get the SGT to depop, it could probably be done without killing a single mob. (IE grabbing a few loose black suits, training into the brawler hedge, make a loop, head back up &amp;amp; procede to kite the 8 mobs in the GY as long as needed)  Expanding on that idea, possibly the SGT from each hedge might depop when the depop is triggered and repop in his assigned area or mausoleum.<br />
<br />
I DID have a rog scout the undead area during this time and he did not notice anything of note, no named mobs, nothing out of the ordinary.  I really wish I would have had the foresight to have scouts placed in the trial rooms to scout for events or changes.<br />
<br />
1 other thing I did notice..<br />
<br />
Once my raid got back together &amp;amp; rebuffed &amp;amp; start pulling our path to HoHb, comming around the last corner is the entrance to the 4th hedge area with the raised building inside.  All the mobs are targetable and all have specific names.  I pulled them &amp;amp; killed them all, but I did make note that a couple of the mobs sparring on the back left side which were INDIFF (Possible quest/trigger/turn-in NPC's?).  I tried a few quick phrases in /say to see if I could trigger any text, but my raid was growing antsy and it was getting late so I just pulled them &amp;amp; killed them &amp;amp; then headed off to HoHb for MM.<br />
<br />
I hope some of this info might help any of you working on the quest as well or at least let you skip a few steps in your solving process.  I plan on working on the depop/repop theory in the near future as time permits.<br />
<br />
Feel free to send me cross server tells if you have any information or updates on this quest or ideas of your own, I'm on nightly like clockwork.<br />

Not sure how that would work. but it makes sense when you think about the logical flag progression that most people take vs the storyline progression.  Basicly the coins are a timesink designed to put off a MM kill till you've progressed in Torment, Drunder and CoD.  I'd like to entertain thoughts of a tie in with PoWar, but lack of details makes that a fruitless task.  Still have a coin or 2 banked myself, /shrug mabey someday they'll reinvent a use for them.  -Bay</div></div><hr />

Quite confused about those 2 untargettable mobs as me and im certainly sure the whole raid was wondering wtf you were pulling and why we werent moving to hohb. It all makes sense now   A noble cause i am sure, and while i only have one symbol myself, im pretty sure i could aquire the other two within a week as my guild needs to backflag for tz/vz and saryn. As a matter of fact i now remember that day NR killed saryn.... and that symbol dropped and nobody knew what it was for and yes... yes you took it defy. Truly an epic quest of sorts so to speak  <br />

<br />
We have the following from Planes of Power<br />
<br />
Bastion of thunder (bothunder)<br />
Halls of Honor (hohonor)<br />
Plane of Disease (podsisease)<br />
Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands (poearth)<br />
Doomfire, the Burning Lands (pofire)<br />
Plane of Innovation (poinnovation)<br />
Plane of Justice (pojustice)<br />
Plane of Knowledge (poknowledge)<br />
Plane of Storms (postorms)<br />
Drunder, Fortress of Zek (potactics)<br />
Plane of Time (potime) - never been so unaware of zone name<br />
Plane of Torment (potorment)<br />
Plane of Tranquility (potranquility)<br />
Plane of Valor (povalor)<br />
Here's the one that confuses me (powar)<br />
Reef of Coirnav (powater)<br />
<br />
So there's those, I got that from the .mp3 files that are in the EverQuest folder, so those are the zones they added with PoP - but there's one more, for powar.<br />
In my perpetual blindness, I have never ever found a zone to or heard of a plane of war that I remember.<br />
I could be missing something, though, but none of my friends have ever had a &quot;powar&quot; tag in a zone they're in, that I've seen, and none of my /who all guild so ...<br />

I got the items returned a few hours later. The GM went and checked the mob. According to him all the povalor mobs are eating things when they're not supposed to. Its 'in development' . The GM went to check logs on the mob but it had been killed (?!?)  and he'd have to wait until it respawned. (Uhm. not surethat makes sense but hewas very polite and this is more of a lead than I've ever seen) The text of the petition response seems to indicate that Sergent Gerrin Bakeside is indeed the right guy to hand stuff to. <br />

Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

People kill these mobs as they drop a component needed for the Aid Grimel earring quest.</div></div><hr />

[edit] nm someone mentioned PoWar already...  feh<br />

No offense, but frankly the GMs second response doesn't sound any less cookie cutter than the first...  Frankly I don't think he had the faintest idea what you were even talking about until he had to go there...</div></div><hr />
