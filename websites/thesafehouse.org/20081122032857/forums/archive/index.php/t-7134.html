Everyone is always whining or begging for kei and i've watched people get to 60 in around a month just because they would port to nexus get c3 go solo and port back to nexus over and over again . It's too easy should put a lvl 55min on it or something. or just put the duration of the spell based on your level.  maybe 1min for lvl one and  sixty mins for lvl 60. Tell me what ya think about it )<br />

Enchanters would be up in arm, its a HUGE money maker for them. The spell itself costs a ton if your not lucky enough to get it with a drop. I can see it being a problem if so many  people can level up that fast, but it does cost a pretty penny most of the time, unless your friends with that enchanter casting it. How many true newbies have 100pp to spare every three hours?<br />

People can get 60 in a month anyways, KEI is just another tool that makes it even more possible for people to get there. <br />

<br />
Lowbie casters aren't the only ones who benefeit from hand-me-downs that trickle down through the expansions. Say you spend 6k on KEI's to get you from 1-50. How well could a melee level up if they were born with 6k in gear?<br />
<br />
It's historically a LOT harder to twink a caster and turn them into a levelling god than it is to do the same for a melee. With KEI it's a little more balanced.<br />
<br />
If you really want to complain about people levelling too fast, look at what ZEM's and level-based exp bonuses in Tier 1/2 PoP make the 50-60 levelling curve from Kunark look like... Your Sister in Arms,<br />

My roomate is playing a cleric, and he is such a crack addict, and he is but 37. He has all his casters run tot he nexus and &quot;donate&quot; cash.. but what he donates has never been more than 30pp, and sence KEI is a group buff the chanters dont really care. I have had a few times and its good for tradeskillin, but I still thenk they should raise the LVL on the spell. Makes it so you get n00b casters, that cant play when they arnt C3ed (like my roomate)  -Nezumi<br />

In the modern eq game getting to 60 is just the start.  It does not hurt the game to let the distance from starting to becoming a useful player stay approximately constant.  It is in fact a &quot;good thing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nerfing KEI duration would affect all groups, especially with the shortage of healers LFG.  I've done fine in plenty of 1st tier PoP groups with only a KEI'd 58+ shammy or druid as healer.  If KEI didn't last as long it would suck big-time. Pualani<br />

<br />
think about it this way...<br />
<br />
your a chanter, but noone wants to group with you cause they all have KEI...they just get a shaman that can haste....<br />
<br />
i have a 52 monk, 38 druid, 30 sham, 33 wiz, 30 necro, 35 war, 30 mage, 28 rogue...and the casters solo much better, much easier...much faster...<br />
without KEI....<br />
they should make a haste that last 3 hours to even it up with melee classes....like 70% haste that lasts 3 hours...i think that would help some...but yet again....noone would group with poor widdle chanters...</div></div><hr />

In PoP you need slow so its chanters and shamans and perhaps bards once they get the song for the higher level slows.  Enchanters also get CC and everyone likes that.  Anyway KEI the way it is is probably as fair as having someone with a fungi or a captive druid there.  The only thing is it may raise the level people really get wise about their class but then again no matter how long the game is out there will still be silly people. ~OSW~</div></div><hr />

Yes it was a mistake.  Verant knows it but wont openly admit it.  KEI2 and KEI3 are done right imo.<br />

I would like KEI nerfed personally.  I dont charge for kei normally....but all these low levels fighting without any chance of going oom sure has brought a lot of poor players to the table.</div></div><hr />

Kei is too overpowering for anyone like under 30.  Limitless mana is just wrong.  And it annoys me to see level like 15s bumming for kei so they can go level like 5 levels in the next 3 hours.  No one pays 100p for kei and i personally paid close to 40k for it and it appears now it will be close to a year until I break even with the cost of the scroll.  I think the FV restriction should be added to all servers the 20 levels is responible imho.  You should learn to use your class w/o having limitless mana.  Like all of us did before kei existed.  Noobs can make up for a lack of skill w/ a never ending mana bar and it hurts the group when you get higher.  Personally, I have been LFG close to 4-6 hours each day(w/ PoV &amp;amp; PoS tags) for that last month and a half.  If the group has KEI no one needs you generally if you have a decent FD puller and a shammy enchanters are replaced by root&amp;amp; shammy slow&amp;amp; (canni) which makes up for the mezzing with extra heals.  After all a Shammy can slow and root and canni (w/ kei on).  Enchanters get no self stacking mana regen buff(that stacks w/kei) unlike ever other class except Sk&amp;amp; Necro.<br />
just my 2cp. Nerf it.  Nerf it level wise.  C2 is still dam nice for 30s. When your oom, your working hard ;) <br />

<br />
Just because someone uses KEI to get thier caster up faster (I have a toy Shammie I play when my Warrior can't get a group) doesn't mean they don't know how to play.  It just means they want to play rather than med for enormous amounts of time.<br />
<br />
KEI is fine.  I see nothing wrong with it.  If you can't make 3kpp per hour in Nexus just taking donations for KEI, theres something wrong with you.  Thats no exaggeration, either.  Thats the average that my guild Chanters quoted.  The spell costs alot, but is also a huge money-maker.  Tell me one thing any other class can do to make that much pp without killing anything?<br />
<br />
And calling for nerfs on anything is just stupid.  Who gives a @#$% if someone can level a caster to 60 a little faster than you did a year ago?  PLing a Melee is infinitely easier than PLing a Caster even with KEI.  I son't see you up in arms about that, though.  Just play the stinking game and don't worry about what everyone else is doing. <br />

<br />
The problem is quite simply not KEI.<br />
<br />
The problem is that high level group spells only take into consideration the level of the target in the caster's target box.  The level restriction test of highlevel spells cast on lower level targets occurs at the start of the cast, not when the spell tries to land.<br />
<br />
If SoE simply fixed that bug, then there would be no KEI, thorns, regens, aegolisms, etc to help levelling. (KEI is actually a very very minor part of powerlevelling.  It's much more of an issue to casters who prefer to solo rather than group at L55+)<br />

<br />
My current character (63rd Beastlord) was powerlevelled from 1st to 50th by a 44th level Druid alt in around 4 days of played time.  Should Druids be nerfed now too because I didn’t feel like having to go through the same damn levels for a 3rd time (59 Necro and 44 Druid)?<br />
<br />
This type of thing has been happening ever since the first players decided to buy a second account so they could powerlevel a warrior to duo with their cleric primary.<br />
<br />
If EQ were only a year or two old I would totally agree with you.  Leveling that fast in a new game would be very bad for business.  Letting people max out their characters so quickly just leads to bored players.<br />
<br />
This game is not new though.  The bulk of new content is all aimed at the 55+ level character, so why is it a problem that there are also new ways to more quickly level a character into this desired level range?<br />

I know enchanters that sit in the Nexus for a day and pull in 10k from donations.  It is incredibly easy to earn back the 40k for a scroll if you are willing to put forth the effort.<br />

This has nothing to do with learning your class.  There have always been people that utterly failed to learn their class before KEI was even an idea on the Verant drawing boards.  This has everything to do with YOU not having had KEI as a low level character.  <br />

You either aren’t an Enchanter or you are perceived on your server as being a very unskilled Enchanter.<br />
<br />
I rarely see enchanters call out LFG more than once, even in zones with 80+ people.  On the rare occasion it does happen there are extenuating circumstances (the enchanter sucks, they are too low level for the zone, or all groups have an enchanter).<br />

<br />
<br />
I have been in groups where we haven’t had an enchanter, but that’s usually because the enchanter we did have had to go, no other enchanters were available, and we took another class.  As the pulling area was already broken we weren’t too concerned.<br />
<br />
The second someone else leaves the group we again start to look for an enchanter.  If none are available (which is usually the case) we again look for another class.<br />
<br />
Bards with their PoP mez song are good substitutions as their mana songs are sweet and they can mez yard trash mobs on PoV.  Bards also kick ass in general, but that’s another topic altogether.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are not always replaceable by root as there are monsters both on and off PoP that cannot be rooted.  Monsters that summon don’t take well to being rooted and having to root park a monster means potentially having to move your entire fight to another location to move out of monster melee range.<br />
<br />
Rooting also does nothing to stop a spellcasting mob from nuking the hell out of you while you fight the other spellcasting monster that is also in camp.<br />

<br />
You want enchanters to have two huge mana buffs?  What, KEI isn’t enough for one class?<br />
<br />
Beastlords get the Spiritual Light/Radiance/Purity/Dominion line.<br />
Enchanters get the Breeze/Clarity/Clarity2/KEI/Tranquility line.<br />
Druids, Wizards, Magicians, Bards, and others get their own form of mana regen.<br />
Necromancers and Shadow Knights have a self-castable only form.<br />
<br />
What’s the common theme here?  It’s that every class gets one big form of mana regen.  Some of them also get smaller forms in addition (ex. Necromancers can cast Manashield that gives an extra point per tick).</div></div><hr />

If you look at the current state of the game, the game is becoming more and more based on power leveling.  I play a 65 rogue, and a 64 enc atm, soon to be 65 this weekend if I shake this stupid cold.  <br />
<br />
Look at all the content that's being added, it's for upper levels mainly.  The older zones have no one in them.  They want people to almost instantly be level 30.  As the game has aged, SOE has either ignored bugs that effect lower levels allowing them to level faster, or flat out made it easier to level in order to allow them to catch up with others.  <br />
<br />
I know if I had a friend who started playing, and realize he had over a year of solid work to get to a point where it was worth me grouping with him, he'd never start the game.  Seeing as I can get him to 60 in 2-3 weeks, he's likely to play the game.  Look at how long it takes to get from 60-65.  Solid grouping for a few weeks and your done.  AA is now the measuring stick, not levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">02-26-03, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like KEI. KEI means less sitting around doing nothing but twiddle your thumbs and wait for mana to come back. With KEI I can be the primary healer as a paladin when grouped with my ranger and monk friends and we can still pull stuff at a decent rate despite my cleric friend being LD or at work. Does that mean if we see an enchanter within range of us looking for a group that we won't take him (provided of course we have room and aren't on a specific drop hunt, I'm not gonna kick out a friend for a stranger)? No, of course not, an enchanter is almost always useful. Does it mean we won't take rogues or other pure melee classes since they don't benefit from kei? Of course not, melee classes means more stable DPS and in general faster killing. Does it mean we refuse to group with people who don't have KEI? Of course not. KEI helps but we're not gonna tell people to go get it before we can group.<br />
<br />
Please, do we really want to get to the point where people are playing gems or even playing other games on their second machine because there's nothing to do but wait for mana for the next 10 minues? In fact I wish there was a 4 hour regen for the pure melees so they could have the same without paying for a fungi tunic. I know that in the time it's taken me to level to 49th I have not paid even a 5th of the price of fungi tunic and I pay the standard fee on my server for KEI.<br />
<br />
As for faster leveling, well I couldn't have leveled as fast as I did without the equipment available now. The more that gets added to the game, the longer the game has been around, the more people know about the game, the easier it gets to level. It's as simple as that. You think there's a 54th lvl froglok cleric on Xev right now just because of KEI? Heh, oh no. KEI may make it a little too easy to level to you. But to me it makes for a lot less of boring non-productive downtime. Getting to max level never made me quit a game. Being bored while playing it did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I want to be paid for everytime I nuke!  30k on sunstrike, 50k on Agnarr's Thunder, 160k on Strike of Solusek.  <br />
<br />
They added port stones in PoK so wiz and druids don't make pp porting....maybe add a KEI stone to screw chanters money making ability?  <br />
<br />
I personally don't see why KEI needs to be nerfed....give me a class that can dump 7500 mana into me like a cleric can HP with a melee and I could care less about KEI.  <br />
<br />
Seriously if you want to nerf something on chanters then get rid of CoD!  Chanters soloing lvl 65 named mobs is farm more lop-siding EQ balance than KEI.</div></div><hr />

No spell... no item.  When a bard goes OOM, he is done charming etc till he gets it back at his cap of 1 mana per tic (2 sitting).  Getting the Earring of the Solistice basically doubled mana regen for bards making charm kiting last a little longer.  One bad pull while swarm kiting can easily throw a bard oom after the first pull.  Nerfing any class is a nasty idea and does nothing other than make everyone else change their strategies.  Who cares if some people can solo a bit better than others?  Who cares if one class is desired over others in groups?  Groups are dynamic and the right players can make many different combos of classes work fine.  Crappy players lead to groups requiring only a certain class line-up for their group.  That and lack of knowledge about other classes.<br />
<br />
All KEI and Aego and the other similar spells have done is help to reduce the downtime that has been such a pain in the ass for so long.   <br />
<br />
Anyone that thinks KEI should be nerfed to slow things down at lower levels needs to start using the boats again all the time and give up on getting ports anywhere or using PoK books or SoL Spires... they save was too much time and allow you to go fight instead of waiting around forever.<br />

<br />
I don't understand why the don't impliment something similar to Minor Illusion's fix on it.  Used to, with perm illusion I  could cast minor illusion, camp, come back and run around as a gravestone or whatever (Indifferent to all), but when I zone or camp back in, the game makes that buff disapear now.<br />
<br />
It would only be a partial fix, but why not have it where KEI is removed on zoning from anyone less than 41st level (or somewhere around there.)  Then you'd still have chanters roaming around from zone to zone buffing, but it would slow the whole thing down some at least.  Or maybe have the system have a check on each time your character is saved, if you're too low for KEI it gets dispelled.  <br />
<br />
I'm mainly just tired of 50 tells a day asking for c3.  Makes playing my rogue SUCH a nice change...<br />

Technically, there is a level cap on KEI and group Aego, etc.  It's just that the way the level check currently works, there is a 'sploit workaround that still lets these buffs land on low level characters.<br />
<br />
Casting high level buffs only checks the level of your target.  Group buffs don't need a target, and therefor get past the level check. Veteran Keiz Dinzyar<br />

<br />
I said it many moons ago, long before there was KEI, and was scoffed at, but I'll say it again:  EQ has become a game of pansy play.  This game is a pushover, gimme a break.<br />
<br />
I don't want to sound like the old man who, when he was younger, had to walk barefoot to school in the snow uphill both ways, but jeez.  The younguns these days aren't even riding the bus, they are clicking books and riding rockets to the moon.  <br />
<br />
It ain't just KEI.  On Saryrn, enchanters group up with druids (PoTG) and others to form the B-Team (buff team), and charge whatever they can at outrageous rates, filling whole groups over and over (&quot;Welcome aboard the Buff Train! Prepare to Be ubah 3..2..1, bingo your done, see you in three hours, NEXT!&quot;)<br />
<br />
Why, someone asked, would anyone ask for a nerf? Why would anyone care if someone you don't know from Adam is PLing to 60 in a few days?  <br />
<br />
I got news for ya.  I use KEI all the time.  Have to to keep up.  I PL the crap outa my alts cause I get bored sometimes with my main.  I use all the things I complain about, because they are there, and everyone is using them. When I am in the middle of the freeway and everyone is going 80 miles per hour, I'm not getting caught riding a horsecart.  This is OUR world, and what WE do affects all.  Slow this mutha down, that's all I'm saying, it's getting too fast.<br />

The bottom line is when your Cleric says OOM, the fun stops and everyone goes to walk the dog till the cleric has enough mana to keep them alive. <br />

KEI makes for a few rich enchanters and a few lucky people who get to get the scroll drop but it makes the game more fun for everyone. Caralon the Crafty<br />

It's not that big of deal to me really.  I have a higher lvl enchanter and cleric I duo with a monk friend, and I always simply use my own buffs.  If I can't make it with what I have openly to me, then I won't do it at all.  I don't really have any opinion one way or other on this topic, but I don't begrudge anyone the right to KEI.

I rarely get c3 on any char right now, unless I'm going on a raid or something.  And when I did get c3 regularly, if I wouldn't be making enough pp on my leveling duringthe c3 time, I wouldn't get it.<br />

What about clerics casting Group Aego/hand?   <br />
Anyway, I will pay a wizard for nukes or a shammy for Topor.... When it lasts for 5+ hours extended and gets me a few levels.  Heck, tell you what.  If you find me a 60+ wizard to follow me around for 5 hours and nuke everything that is just over half dead then I will give them my standard c3 payment 20-25 plat. They are providing a service to me and deserve to be paid, just at the cleric does for group aego/hand.</div></div><hr />

I began playing EQ in July of 1999.  That's about as near to the beginning as you are gonna see.  I have one character really.  I only have time for one character.  As I play less and less, I am more often to end up popping in for an hour to solo somewhere and maybe do something interesting.<br />
<br />
When I play, I don't want to %^&amp;amp;* around medding, healing, regenning, or any other dumb time sink stuff.  I wanna play.<br />
<br />
Three spells (besides a paladin's own) are all it takes for me to do this...<br />
The KEI line from chanters<br />
The Focus line from Shamans<br />
The Ageo line from clerics.<br />
<br />
With these three spells, after having CLAWED my way to level 55, I can actually play on MY TERMS, WHEN I WANT TO.<br />
<br />
People calling for a nerf to these spells are just plain silly.  Sure, folks level REALLY quick.  Sure, lots of folks do not know how to play.  Guess what?  You do not have to group with them!  Consider it training for the first time you are gonna have to break up with someone.  Just learn how to dump them from your group all diplomatic like.<br />
<br />
Do NOT screw up the little joy I have left in EQ.  I have done all the things that EQ has to offer during my time with the exception of bunches of new zones that I will probably never see.  Heck, I am excited to go tramping through Kunark dungeons sometimes.  I have been a guild leader, guild officer (same guild and they are raiding and well!), I got my epic, I have made alliances, made wars, made peace on the Rallos Zek server before switching out this Spring to Maelin Starpyre to retire.<br />

Either that or increase the duration on Voice of Quellious to match it with a means to keep it off sub 50 people. <br />
<br />
Kei was to be our raid level buff so we didn't have to put 3 buffs on everyone to boost mana regen. It wasn't supposed to be a means for low level people to rocket to 60+.<br />
<br />
Yeah, when i got my Kei scroll ( 30k) I whored myself out to recoup the money ( stopped taking money after i hit ~30k)but after a while I noticed groups were coming up and getting Kei with no enc in the group. They didn't need/want one. Once they got kei they had no need for an enc and opted for a dps class instead. Crowd Control? Root or with the gear that a melee can get now ( thanks to the baz and 4 years of mudflation) offtanks can easily CC. Thats not counting the classes that have ghetto mez, bard and necro ( don't laugh at necro mez I've had necros save my ass with it)<br />
<br />
Once i hit 65 I got VoQ ( 40K) and  I have never accepted money for casting it. I don't cast it as often as I did Kei as no one wants it. They would rather take  a 3 hour buff over a 2 hour SUPERIOR buff. Thats wrong, no way should a  level 60 spell should be prefered over a 65 spell.<br />
<br />
A few weeks back a enc guildie sent me a tell while he was /lfg in BoT. He was asking if I ever got tells to come Kei a group, not to come join them but just to drop on by and cast it on em.  I replied &quot;nope i'm perma /role&quot;  (  have been since dinging 60 and the tell-hell it brought), he response was &quot; Man, it's bad tonight&quot;. The same exact thing the lower level groups were doing, get kei and forget the enc for 3 hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oddly enough KEI is why I made a rogue to play. No mana to watch and  no beggars bugging the crap outta me. Just pure simple bloodlust and sharp edges.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kei is a good spell but in reality the mana regen isn't that much better than c2, the  real difference  between the 2 is the amount of INT/WIS kei gives and the +250 raw mana. A sub 60 enc with all his spells can keep a group in mana easily.<br />
<br />
Bottom line Kei is out of whack with the other mana spells and needs to be adjusted so it checks the level of the pc  as it lands. <br />
