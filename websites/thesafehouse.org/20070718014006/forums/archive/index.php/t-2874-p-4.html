The game as packaged can get old alot faster if you're not exploring what else is made available. I've been playing it off and on for a few months, and still enjoy it. I know some people who feel the same way, and an equal number who say, &quot;I got tired of it after the first week!&quot;  If you already have it though, I'd definately reccomend giving it a whirl. It's not hard to find new stuff for it, every time you load it, you get the option to goto their homepage, which has tons of links to fan/skin-maker's sites.</div></div><hr />

 Donuts rapidly fly out of the Donut Machine, to everyone's horror. However, this is no problem for Jhani!!! The sugar-queen dashes around the room, downing the donuts, and occasionally taking a swig from her syrup bottle. She, of course, retains her girlish figure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing that always stops me are my EQ friends.  It's amazing how you loathe playing this game but will still log on just to do stuff with your friends sometime.<br />
<br />
Personally I probably have another character left in me.  I would try PvP (Vallon of course), but I kind of wanted to start a wizzie and they are a dime a dozen there (so I hear).<br />
<br />
Oh, and I freaking HATE my work's internet connection.  Stopped me from reading the house all day.  Look at all the stuff I missed out on.  It's like a soap opera.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they up a new server, I'm going to start new there - I can't resist.  It's just a blast being a pioneer instead of a cleanup batter.<br />
<br />
I can't keep a secondary though, I have little time and it must all go into a single project.<br />
<br />
My interest in EQ comes and goes on a whim, I sometimes create alts and are bored with the idea before I even get through the first loading screen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting Trudgalong up to the level he is has been more work than I can explain.  Not the work of leveling him, but the work of keeping with him, instead of starting a new &quot;secondary&quot; every other week.  I'm a server jumper, too.  I have at least one character above level 6 on about 8 different servers.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not starting over.  Not for a while at least, and maybe never.  I'm content with being a &quot;former EQ'er&quot; and message board lurker.  If you'll have me, Safehouse?   &quot;Trudgalong&quot; Bort Horrissbogg<br />

Although Monday is a Bank Holiday the Power In The Land that is British Telecom charges normal week-day rates for phone calls, so I won't be on EQ until post 6pm.

I'm waiting for my ISP to launch their Surftime packages.  Although the exchange I'm on won't be Surftime enabled until October (even though it's ADSL enabled, d'oh) the number they use will be cheaper from the outset than 0845.<br />
<br />
Of course, there's always ADSL but at a 50:1 contention ratio for home users, I have my doubts.  Besides, consumer rollout for ADSL still hasn't started...<br />

I had a great weekend.. I ended up deciding to re-guild (PE had gotten back together a while back, but I was putting off rejoining, mulling some things over, going on an EQ  sabbatical, if you will.) and spent some time grouping with one of my guild leaders. (PE's co-owned)<br />
<br />
I missed a local con a bunch of my friends went to, but despite their promises of comming back with various areas autographed by Calisto, no one did, all just moping about the $35 charge to get autographs.</div></div><hr />
