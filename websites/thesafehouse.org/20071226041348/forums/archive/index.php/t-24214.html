<br />
Plot Summary: <br />
<br />
Hakuoro has lost his memory after succumbing to serious injuries; but thanks to a elderly woman and her granddaughter Eruruu, he is nursed back to health. His face is covered by a strange irremovable mask and he occasionally sees beastly visions. <br />
<br />
Eruruu now cares for him as he becomes accustomed to the village and its inhabitants who all bear strange ears (the women have tails too). Though these people venerate the forces of nature, desecration of an alter forces them to take drastic measures to preserve their lives from the wrath of Mutikapa-sama, guardian of the forest. <br />
<br />
Genres: <br />
<br />
Adventure, Fantasy, Mystery, Shounen</div></div><hr />

Episode five spoilers:<br />

When he was given the question, &quot;Do you think what you are doing is right?&quot; He actually gave a sincere answer to it. The way he struggles with himself internally, but is wise enough to know that he must keep moving forward no matter what.<br />

Not allowing what he feels his past mistakes to weight him down, and instead focuses on what he can do now. It's a really refreshing change from childish characters that we're used to in anime. <br />

I really like how Aruuru's tiger has grown so big, and is protecting the village. &quot;Hey... that's cheating!&quot; It's so cute to watch her with him :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. He really isn't one-dimension at all - I'm curious as how his story turns out - esp. what/who he actually is.<br />
<br />
And Eruruu, Aruruu &amp; Mukuko are awesome! So cute!!! (sorry, can't help myself *G*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Episode six, not much in the way of light-hearted moments compared to earlier episodes, but to be expected.<br />
<br />
Heeeheee at Eruruu blushing so apparently at the energy plant. That was cute. I liked how the twins were trying on jewelry. ITS A TRAP!!!!! I'd almost go gay for those two. They are very, very cool in this episode, how they ran through the forest to arrive at the opposing camp. While they are minor characters, it's fun watching them in the background.<br />
<br />
The action sequences continue to be excellent. Fighting is VERY well done here. I was a bit annoyed that Hakuoro was able to defend against the samurai leader so well in the last fight between the two, given he's shown very little in the way of martial art skills. To see him thorougly owned this episode was a nice change.<br />
<br />
Wish Mukuru would help them in battles, talk about one sided matches. But another part of me says, Mukuru is Aruruu's, and hers alone!! Watching Mukuru get bloodstained would feel like some small taint on her, but I guess it'll probably happen eventually. I hope Aruruu won't take part in the fighting as the OP seems to show, I don't want her to be put in bad situations :(<br />
<br />
Can you tell I love her so? :)<br />
<br />
Another excellent plot-moving episode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For whatever it's worth, it's never been unclear in the game. They referred to themselves as boku, the masculine way of saying &quot;I.&quot; (not that it rules out women referring to themselves as such, but that's stretching it.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aruruu goes round and round and round and round and round and round and round *dizzy*<br />
<br />
I really did not like the development (or lack thereof) of the Emperor. He was just plain and stereotypical. I wonder who's going to be the Emperor? Hakuoro or Benawi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-20-06, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder who's going to be the Emperor? Hakuoro or Benawi? <br />
<br />
Yeah, I've been wondering too.. although I think it might be Benawi. Although that would somehow make Hakuoru rank below him, which seems unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">05-21-06, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, nevermind... I was wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-29-06, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Episode 8 spoilers<br />
<br />
Well, turns out that Hakuoro actually accepted being an Emperor. And he managed to retain Benawi on his side. Good news! I'm glad that the winged beings turned out to be a good race, they seemed questionable before we saw them.<br />
<br />
Those aside, it wasn't much of a plot-moving episode. Not that I am complaining. I don't know if I've been so excited and happy in an episode for a long time! Watching Kamyu try to get close to Aruruu, and Aruruu getting scared away was ultimate super attack moe~<br />
<br />
And oh man, Mukuru looks so comfy :) When I saw Yuzuyu, Kamyu, and Aruruu piled up sleeping on Mukuru, I had an irresistible urge to jump in and sleep! So peaceful, nice and warm i'm sure!<br />
<br />
I loved the scenes of them playing together. It was wonderful to see. And we got to see Eruruu's feelings too. I hope there's more focus on her. I know she's sad and lonely. I felt sorry for her when Hakuoro called her a sister. That must have been painful to hear from your most loved. <br />
<br />
I realize Hakuoro is Emperor now, but he IS cutting from work. It wouldn't hurt if he used that time to spend with Eruruu more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-29-06, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ep 8<br />
<br />
Yes, I totally agree Stalk... it's a nice episode, even though there is barely plot in it.<br />
<br />
It's good to see Benawi stayed and is acting as captain - I was hoping for it, but you couldn't be too sure about it.<br />
<br />
The scenes with the girls were great, and Mukuru is just awesome - I keep laughing out loud while watching Utawa.<br />
<br />
The characters in this series are really well done, they show feelings and aren't simple and two-dimensional.<br />
<br />
Being called sister must really have been a low-blow for Eruruu.. I feel sad for her, I doubt she'll ever become Hakuoro's partner.<br />
<br />
Now, seeing how &quot;idylic&quot; this episode was, I expect the next one to bring quite a disturbance in the peace... and no, I did NOT watch the preview.. I didn't want to spoil the image of the peaceful country.<br />
<br />
Please don't talk about Ep. 9 preview without adding additional spoiler-tags and warnings that it talks about ep. 9 stuff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-29-06, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a good spoiler rule to add, lots of us (myself included) do not watch previews.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I agree. Especially in the end, when he said &quot;I wish for days like these to continue... forever.&quot; That made my heart skip a beat. I hope nothing too bad happens, if it does happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, as expected, the peace doesn't last. But I like the character development of the main chars more and more.. although I feel sorry for poor Eruruu, she so mixed up emotionally...</div></div><hr />

Yep, Touka was fun: It doesn't matter if it's cute or... uhm..*blush*<br />
<br />
I have to admit though, that little guy is damn cute - I'd love to have one as a pet too. I like squirrels, and this is sort of a super-squirrel  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are guys, unless they changed their sex in Anime.<br />
<br />
Dori &amp; Gura (&#12489;&#12522;&#12451; &amp; &#12464;&#12521;&#12449;, )?, (Seiy&#363; - Akeno Watanabe)<br />
    Twin brother archers serving under Oboro. They are very feminine in appearance and mannerisms, so in effect they often get mistaken for girls. Their gender is specified in dialogue in the game, but the anime adaptation has yet to make it unmistakably clear, which is most likely just the studio Oriental Light and Magic trying to mess with the viewers.<br />
<br />
    There are several ways to tell them apart. For one, Dori has purple eyes while Gura's are blue. Also, the bottom part of Dori's clothes are blue while with Gura they are red.</div></div><hr />

Of course I did, actually the fact that if they are female would make that scene even more wrong.<br />

I am positive they are male. Flat chested, yet most other females characters sport quite a load.</div></div><hr />

How they got Shadow Warrior Chronicles out of that - or anything else in the series, is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the news of the day is that Utawarerumono got licensed by ADV, and that its English release name will be “Shadow Warrior Chronicles,” at least according to what ANN is reporting from Otakon. I usually don’t care at all about dubs or how things are done stateside, but this was just too hilarious and ridiculous a name to pass up.<br />
Having said that, the growing consensus seems to be that either ADV or ANN screwed up and that the English titles for Utawarerumono and the other ADV license Shin Angyo Onshi - supposedly re-titled “Blade of the Phantom Mask” - got mixed up. This would make a ton of sense, since Shin Angyo Onshi actually has “phantom soldiers” (aka. shadow warriors) and Utawarerumono actually features someone with a mask. “Blade of the Phantom Mask” still isn’t a fantastic title, but it’s not bad either. And it certainly doesn’t make me crack up like “Shadow Warrior Chronicles” does (at least in relation to Utawarerumono).</div></div><hr />

Sounds more like a movie title then a series name =/.</div></div><hr />

I think the closest title you could get would probably be something like &quot;The Legendary One&quot; or &quot;The One of Legends&quot;, but neither are great titles either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to remind people that since it's now licensed, direct links are not allowed to be publicly posted. That aside, the special came with the DVD release of Utawarerumono. It's a comedy short about Oboro and Hakuoro, and extremely humorous.</div></div><hr />

Go watch it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">09-06-06, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just saw the special... All I can say is &quot;Please watch again&quot; with the twins.... soooooooooo hot if they are girls - and sooooooooooooo wrong if they are men. :oops</div></div><hr />

<br />
The end was kind of out there.  A lot of things in the anime were forced compared to the game. Overall, it hit the spot in many aspects- mostly catching the &quot;fanservice&quot; moments to gamers (not fanservice as in sexual, but they did that well too.)<br />
<br />
I found the whole sci-fi element to be out of the left field in the anime. But the end was ok. Nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm happy, even if I liked the earlier episodes better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">10-17-06, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just finished watching the last few episodes yesterday.  The ending was good (Eruruu was great) but the episodes felt a little rushed.  If the dub of this is any good I will probably buy it.</div></div><hr />
