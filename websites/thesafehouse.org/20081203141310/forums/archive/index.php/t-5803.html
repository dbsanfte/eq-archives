The most special of these tweaks that I have questioned them about is the hide ability.  It will more than likely result in your agressor losing you as a target after you have hidden.  Example.<br />
<br />
Player A Wizard is attempting to nuke you.  You seeing the warm up for the spell hide to evade the spell.  You sucessfully hide.  Player A Wizard loses you as a target and is about to waste mana and must interrupt himself.<br />
<br />
Also there are some other PvP changes that will more than likly be carried over to our other PvP servers.  More class balancing in PvP.  <br />

I think these changes make sense on sullon, seeing as rogues will be very underpowered for quite some time.  On the other zeks, this might make us too powerful 50+. Edited by: Cylant at: 6/24/01 5:09:38 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Removing a rogue from a caster's target has been something I've felt should be in the game for a long time.  And, as you noted, a caster with see invis can retarget as long as they are in line of sight.  This is a great effect because what this will do is deter those casters who were abusing line of sight in the first place by using /target name.  While casters will still be able to cast through walls at least now a rogue has some kind of action they can take.<br />
<br />
I hope this works out on Sullon and they decide to move it to the other Zeks.<br />
<br />
As for the rangers, I don't think they need any boosting either but they can debate that on their boards as I have only played a low level ranger.               Fricka       of the Vallon Zek Shanks<br />

The pickpocket change would be ridiculously overpowered, and frankly I won't believe it until I see something official.  Imagine how many rogues would be crowded into the room where you buy T-boots.<br />

<br />
Kendrick... do you realize just how powerful this will be?  <br />
<br />
Basically anyone who can't see invis or doesn't have a pet will be EASY pickings for a rogue.<br />
<br />
A Rogue could just Hide/Sneak behind someone, wait enough time for hide ot be ready when you unhide, backstab and rehide instantly knocking you off target.   The ONLY way to combat that would be to have see invis (spell or item) or a pet (any pet it doesn't matter, cause pets &quot;see invis&quot; if you hit their masters)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong.  I do think it is a good change, but I really don't think Verant has thought this out fully.<br />
<br />
Try it out if you don't believe me.  I guarantee I could kill anyone who does not have see invis or a pet up (unless they zone  ) just on the sheer fact that Hide drops you off target and if you wait long enough Hide will reset while hidden (a VERY good thing for PvE, so if you feel like changing something to better PvP please make sure it won't adversly effect PvE in the future.)  So basically you can just backstab for big damage and rehide, dropping you off target, this basically gives your opponent under a second to retaliate. <br />
<br />
And for kicks you could really screw him over by PickPocketing at the same time  .<br />
<br />
Anyway I am glad to see changes made to try and make rogues more Pvp friendly.  They already are EXTREMELY powerful in ANY kind of group PvP or PvE situation, but the 1 on 1 is a little lacking (although you really can't ask for everything and since Kunark all Rogues have really gotten is MUCH more powerful.)<br />

This change goes beyond affecting rogues. Anyone with an instant cast invis item (and there are enough out there that this is an issue) effectively becomes impossible to target because they can repeatedly and instantly remove themselves from targetting. If the targetter has see invis, the target (be it rogue, sk, whatever) should NOT be removed from targetting. Save yourselves a patch, VI, and do this right the first time.

<br />
They can code this so it only works for rogues which makes sense.<br />
<br />
Because this isn't so much a new effect given to hide, it's a way of making our ability to EVADE work in pvp.  Evade is a rogue only ability linked to our hide skill.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you are only dropped off target on a successful evade instead of a successful hide.<br />
<br />
I hope this works out on Sullon, and it is brought to all servers for the purposes of pvp.<br />
<br />
The coin thing?  Sure, it makes sense.  Balance questions abound I'm sure.<br />

We'll have to see how it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong.  Most rogues use evade with a  hotkey, /attack off then /doability (hide), then /attack on, for a BRIEF second, a rogue does become invis with evade, but it fades almost instantly, because autoattack goes back on...<br />

<br />
the rogue class would be able to solo some (not as well as monks can, though - they have innate mend). This would never make rogue even nearly effective as necro or magician which risk just the lives of their pets in combat - but would ask for some more cunning, wit and reflexes.<br />
<br />
Rogue is supposedly self-sustained witty character that is able to live on his own everywhere in fantasy adventure setups. Castrated EQ rogue, on the other hand, needs healer's and tank's mercy to thrive - so is quite opposite of that.<br />

I know its too late to save the lives of all of us pre-Kunark rogues´, but methinks D&amp;D value of the class needs get redeemed heh *whaddaheck*<br />

Because the idea of a warrior with a two hander is not going to work--once the rogue hides, the warrior loses the target.  He doesn't get a chance to hit the rogue.  <br />
What they need to do is make is so it does not detarget you for two seconds.  This way anyone without see invis has a chance to strike you where you used to be.  If they miss, you successfully get off target.  It also makes it more of a reflex thing.  The melee must see that the enemy has hidden, turn off attack, throw his range item all within those two seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get a clue and realize by lvl 12, most int casters have invis and see invis already.<br />
<br />
Shaman have to wait till lvl 29, and clerics well they never travel alone anyway.<br />
<br />
If ya think ppl walk around on the pvp server with 500 pp and dont have see invis up, ya show your obvious bluebie roots.<br />
<br />
And yes if by chance some rog and war happen to be all alone and meet for a one on one battle(rarely if ever happens, with 2 mins a backup force will come running), A war wll be at a disadvantage, but who gives a damn?<br />
If I face a mage with a earth pet, im at a major disadvantage, thats life. <br />
<br />
Certain classes will have advantage over others and you need to react and make a desicion. <br />
<br />
Thats life on a pvp server, it isnt some @#%$ you can whine about and get it patched.<br />
<br />
And about stealing coin, whens the last time you stole 20pp from something other than a sand giant?<br />
<br />
Like was said before, this aint lvl 50 RB land, this is lvl 12 giant snake fang lande, please try to remeber how that was is you havent experinced it in awhile.<br />
<br />
Im sure a lvl 60 rog with max skill will be taking 3-4 pp per pick, at lvls before that you are not gonna be able to be some magical thief taking money from people without them knowing.<br />
<br />
The second a rogue enters the zone with a rep for stealing, belive me the shouts will go up<br />
&quot;Hey that mofo thief soandso is here&quot;<br />
Ppl will make sure they atleast one of thier group members will have see invis.<br />

Explain to me how it is overpowering?<br />
<br />
casting splurt wich cant be removed my cancel magic/annul is also overpowering, but do you whine or react?<br />
<br />
Get it in your head SZ isnt your regular server.<br />
<br />
The only problem I see is how spells &quot;resolve&quot; once the person has been targerted, starts to cast a spell then the person hides.<br />
<br />
Again, do you have experince in pvp?<br />
<br />
Do ya realize the majority of the fights will not be a nice one on on battle with everyone full health.  If I evade from one caster, he has two friends standing right there to cast spells on me wich I cant evade in time.  I have a pet on me prevetning me from hiding.  I have a warrior beating on my head and Im also snared.<br />

Get a clue man, log into Sullon Zek before you make your desision sitting in greater faydark on some old world server, making descisions on something that is completely foreign to you.<br />

<br />
However, if you read what Kendrick said Quote: Hiding and Invis will take you off targetting with the next patch on Sullon<br />
<br />
The fact that invis will take you off of target as well means that anyone with an instant click invisibility item (such as circlet of shadows) can just run around spamming invisibility and no one will be able to hurt them because they are constatnly droped off target.  Even if you have see invis you still lose target according to kendrick.  This ability really needs to be chanced to hide only - making invis drop you off target as well is very abusable by items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-26-01, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the point is it means all classes without see invis  cannot win against a rogue who has instant hide vs. 5 second invis of a caster.<br />
   Warrior, rogue, monk, cleric, paladin, ranger (until level 39), SK (until level 22), bard (until level 19).  Some of these can cast.  Those who can't cast (the melees) appear to have no way of interrupting or breaking hide.  Even if you are a class that can cast during this time, a decent rogue can just wait for the moment its target is not casting.  No one can cast nonstop.  <br />
    Now if there were a one or two second timer for detargeting to work, then a warrior or monk would not be helpless against a rogue.  If they were near the end of a swing they would have a &amp;lt;60% chance of interrupting.  The way it's phrased now, it will be impossible warrior or monk to beat a mediocre rogue under these conditions.  A mediocre rogue will learn to stay hidden for 10 seconds before coming out with a backstab so that hide automatically refreshes.  <br />
   It's not the case that those who can't see invis get this buff.  In 21 levels of play with an SK on Vallon, I have received see invis twice.  By the time you realize you need it, it will be too late.  <br />
   Is it unbalancing?  Not against any caster class.  Caster classes won't be affected at all except they have to reorder their pet to attack and hit F8--a sneaking rogue can't move out of sight fast enough.  Against any class that cannot see invis, maybe it is.  Casting hybrids will probably still be better in P v P (they can still root, shadowstep or snare), but a warrior or monk cannot defeat a rogue unless they can put their back to the wall, and will have to zone /q otherwise.  <br />
   If it's going to be that way, I guess it's an improvement nonetheless, but it seems a bit messed up for this benefit to come at the expense of other melee classes, which were already underpowered in P v P.   When a rogue attempts to fight another rogue on Sullon, what I'm saying should become obvious. Edited by: Lisboa at: 6/26/01 3:10:25 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
It only looks like you do from your own external perspective.<br />
<br />
It's easy to check, get on the agro of a mob in a group and have someone else get the mob on them after your sure your on the hate list.<br />
<br />
Then, sneak, followed by hide.  You will get the evade message.<br />
<br />
Now, go walk over to a mob you have not agroed while the fight is still going on an con it, you will notice, wether you succeeded to evade or failed, that the mob will still scowl at you, ready to attack.<br />
<br />
This is because, despite the messages you get, when you are evading you do NOT hide.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if dropping from the hate list is an effect of all types of hide and all invis spells I can defiantly see where this would become unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Items like the Circlet of Shadows and the rogue Sky mask would make one invincible.<br />
<br />
This target dropping ability SHOULD be an effect of Evade, not hide and invis in general.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd just like to mention that I think wether or not you succeed on an evade should be determined by your Hide skill, not just a flat 2 thirds of the time.  And a rogue with 200 hide skill should never fail an Evade, unless he's moving or something.</div></div><hr />

What about all the other PvP servers? I thought from the start that evading in battle should get rid of target. It is so annoying when you are fighting a necro, sk or wizzie who shadow steps away from you, and can still cast a spell on you. than the only chance you have of surviving is to zone.

You can preach day in and day out about how its not unbalancing, and how its a &quot;nice change&quot;, and how you're right and I'm wrong, but when it comes down to it *I* have the 1 and a half+ years of PvP experience and *YOU* do not.

@#%$ @#%$, you might as well start arguing to me about how Malo isn't overpowered in PvP, &quot;but i t hsa a cats tyme a nd yuo cna intrupt it&quot;.  Don't even get me started on THAT issue.

It will totally destroy any jousting strategy you ever had, and possibly make it to where you *can't* fight back against necro's and SK's (and we all know those 2 classes need help in the pvp area).<br />
<br />
In a one on one situation using the current ruleset, from levels 1 to 60 between a rogue and a warrior is pretty simple.  If its a good warrior, he will slap on a 2 hander and get the most out of a round.  If its a good rogue, he will sneak/hide when the warrior runs past him and then sneak around his back to get a backstab.  Before I got my perma-see invis item (read: level 60), Rogues would seriously screw me up with the sneak hide.  Just IMAGINE what they could do to me if they were erased from my target everytime we went by each other.  I would get *no* hits in due to not having a target to GET hits in.<br />
<br />
If you, as a red rogue, cannot see how overpowering this would be to YOU, then you need to take a step back and quit your rogue.  Everyone likes changes that benefit their class, and they will find a plethora of reasons as to why it isn't overpowering, but in actuality the reasons they listed are too stupid to even work.<br />

Just to clarify for you, a rogue can only evade (hide) successfully when they are completely still.  So there would be no running past you and hitting hide.  That wouldn't work...<br />
<br />
For this reason I don't think it is unbalancing against another melee.  Against a caster, perhaps slightly.  But hey, more power to us... <br />

<br />
How would a rogue hitting hide every time he swings (and appears) beat a warrior?  Any smart warrior, when they see the rogue has hidden, would just leave the area.  It is incredibly hard to get a BS in on someone while sneaking.  If the warrior is simply standing there, yes the rogue could beat him using this tactic:  BS, rehide, sneak around, BS, rehide, etc.  But anyone who is even remotely moving around would take literally hours for this method to work.  Or here's an idea: keep auto-attack on so that every time the rogue takes a stab at ya he is automatically targeted and smacked around a bit?<br />
<br />
Anyways, what I'm saying is that a rogue using this tactic ain't unbalanced, he's just boring.<br />
<br />
Nimm<br />
<br />
Edit:  One thing that would be interesting is something I have never tried/experienced:  Do PC's affect a rogue similarly as MOBs?  In other words, does a rogue get knocked back when getting wailed on by another PC?  Cause if this is true, hiding would be even more difficult...

<br />
You can Hide/Sneak behind someone, Backstab, rehide instantly and repeat.  Primarily I am more concerned about how overpowering this tactic will be at 55+ levels as the Rogue is BSing double 300s+ easy, sneaking faster, and with Jboots or SoW their is VERY little risk.<br />
<br />
Also with Invis doing this, this opens up SKs and Necros (Circlet of Shadows), any plate class (Incardine BP), and Rogues (PoA Mask) to have an incrediably powerful method of basically reeming people by being able to untarget yourself at will.  NONE of these items are overpowering in PoE, but with the proposed PvP change extremely powerful (class defining items as far as PvP is concerned).<br />
<br />
My bet is Verant will just nerf these items instead of actually fixing the fact that the ability to untarget yourself from others is extremely powerful.  <br />
<br />
I DO actually think you should be able to untarget yourself, but it should be on some sort of timer.  Pure melee classes specifically really could use something like this.  The current proposal just sounds way to easy to abuse and further favors melee classes with decent resists over casters at high levels. <br />

People PvP as little as possible as-is, and when you DO manage to get around to PvPing now-adays (read: coin-loot only), they generally last 30+ minutes (as an average, melee vs. melee...I could see taking 10-15 min).  Everybody on the server already knows which dungeons you are and are not supposed to enter, and those dungeons are blue straight down to the core.  The only PvP you get is the offchance that someone may try to enter that dungeon late at night.  Yes, it may come as a big surprise, but we, &quot;teh l33t peekayers&quot; do not PvP unless we go out and seek it, and about 2% of the population does that, and 99.9% of that 2% is below level 30 (speaking as a day to day basis, I often find myself on a raid group to Karnor's Castle every once in a blue moon).<br />
<br />
Something like this would just totally kill any pvp contact I had with a rogue, what little of it I *do* have.  What I wish for is for them to stop screwing around with PvP balancing, it was pretty damn balanced until they screwed around with Harmtouch, and then later resist debuffs (not so much anything else as much as Malo is, you will fear the unresistable -70 to all resists).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Coraan</div><div class="date">06-27-01, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">JamesVZ, I have played on tallon Zek since it started, and some of your statements are way off base, imho.<br />
<br />
JamesVZ - &quot;In a one on one situation using the current ruleset, from levels 1 to 60 between a rogue and a warrior is pretty simple. If its a good warrior, he will slap on a 2 hander and get the most out of a round. If its a good rogue, he will sneak/hide when the warrior runs past him and then sneak around his back to get a backstab. Before I got my perma-see invis item (read: level 60), Rogues would seriously screw me up with the sneak hide. Just IMAGINE what they could do to me if they were erased from my target everytime we went by each other. I would get *no* hits in due to not having a target to GET hits in.&quot;<br />
<br />
What red server are you talking about? A warrior vs a rogue, just them two fighting it out for an entire fight? sounds like a duel to me. That does not happen on a red server. Why? Both of those classes are group dependent, so you will rarely find and engage them alone. Oh, but sure, they are, say, traveling through DL, planning on meeting their friends at the rings. and you (a warrior) find them and engage them.. (because warriors go solo PK raiding sooo often.)<br />
<br />
But let us entertain your situation. Ok, so the warrior and rogue are fighting, and the warior is getting beat... hmm what happens? Maybe the warrior runs off when the rogue hides/sneaks... and yells to the zone that he needs help (if he is in a zone his team controlls ).. or maybe his guildmates arrive, seeing how the moment the fight started, he alerted to them he was getting Pked and where. <br />
<br />
A rogue who is sneaking cannot catch a warrior who is running away. Hell atleast in this match-up you can get away.. a warrior against some other, one on one, you might as well start planning your corpse run. <br />
<br />
Of course, another thing the warrior can do is retarget on the rogue, that is if the warrior has see invis. Of course you are saying a warrior cannot get a see invis item until level 60...<br />
What? Ever heard of the Bracer of the hidden? Or the necklace that comes out of droga/mines of Nurga area? My ranger had a bracer at 35. seventy-percent of the warrios I know have one. and if you are not uber enough to kill sarnacks in LOIO, I see them auctioned all the time.<br />
<br />
Later on you made another reference to see invis, in your response to other posters...<br />
<br />
poster - &quot;Get a clue and realize by lvl 12, most int casters have invis and see invis already.&quot;<br />
James VZ - I played a caster 1 through 60, and a warrior 1 through 60, I can count on my hand the number of times I thought See Invis was a necessary buff for pvp.<br />
<br />
poster - &quot;If ya think ppl walk around on the pvp server with 500 pp and dont have see invis up, ya show your obvious bluebie roots.&quot;<br />
JamesVZ - &quot;I believe in carrying around in excess of 250+pp now that item loot is out, and I got my first see invis item at level 60.&quot;<br />
<br />
What? I really doubt you play on a PvP server. See invis is almost always up, unless you are deep into a dungeon, or well within the safe lands of your team. If you are in hostile lands, you will always have it if it is available. It is kinda like checking who is in the zone  ALL the time. Hell I use my bracer of the hidden ot see invis the groups because it is faster, and it is a MUST buff.<br />
<br />
And I don't carry that much change. why? It is heavy. Of course you are a warrior and can surely carry more. But the only reason why people on the high end carry a lot of coin is because they get a lot of coin from mobs at higher levels, and it adds up faster. Not sure what your point is about this..<br />
<br />
Poster - &quot;&quot;And yes if by chance some rog and war happen to be all alone and meet for a one on one battle(rarely if ever happens, with 2 mins a backup force will come running)&quot;<br />
JamesVZ -&quot;? Do you actually play on a pvp server on a day to day basis? Where have you been?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unless you are solo PKing in a zone like OOT, yes there will be back-up in about 2 minutes. Unless you keep it to yourself that you are in a fight, and don't tell your group/guild/zone. But of course your adversary just did... and the only reason backup might not come, is that he doesnt need any to drop you solo. On a PvP server, it is rare for someone not to just wander into your fight to begin with.<br />
And I am not even taking into account MOBs.<br />
<br />
Poster - &quot;A war wll be at a disadvantage, but who gives a damn?&quot;<br />
JamesVZ &quot;-Me, the warrior, but I have faced disadvantages before and spit in its face. This is complete and total power over another class. Imagine an instant casting, unresistable snare. Sorta like that in terms of &quot;disadvantage&quot;.<br />
<br />
No it is nothing like that. Your comparison is way off. With an unresistable snare, you cant get away, and you die. With rogues having this power, you can still always turn tale and run. That is , unless, he hs jboots, and you still do not (I have a feeling you havnt gotten even those yet).<br />
<br />
poster - &quot;&quot;Like was said before, this aint lvl 50 RB land, this is lvl 12 giant snake fang lande, please try to remeber how that was is you havent experinced it in awhile.&quot;<br />
JamesVZ &quot;-When I was using a giant snake fang, I was level 34.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, seeing how you carry all your plat when you are out PKing, I can understand why you couldnt afford a better wep.<br />
<br />
poster - &quot;&quot;The second a rogue enters the zone with a rep for stealing, belive me the shouts will go up<br />
&quot;Hey that mofo thief soandso is here&quot;<br />
Ppl will make sure they atleast one of thier group members will have see invis.&quot;<br />
JamesVZ &quot;-Riiiiight.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you have spent anytime whatsoever on a pvp server, you know about shouts going up in a zone saying a pk raiding group is there&quot; and hell ya, see invis is passsed out, MR gear is put on, PvP buffs are tossed out, and mobs are not pulled till the situation is assesed.<br />
<br />
Sorry to go off on this tangent, but I really didnt like the PvP server world to be so misrepresented. <br />

-Most of my encounters take place as a solo battle.  I very rarely PvP in a group, but often I do find myself PvPing against a small group of maybe 2 or 3.  Classes being group dependent has @#%$ to do with it, fungi tunic + 207 bind wound skill and I'm ready to go again in under a minute.<br />

-Yes it is, I know that on Vallon Zek any place outside a dungeon is practically barren for the most part (save Sro and oasis, 2 very good prime PvP spots).  I can sit just outside of the stone at KC and fight someone there 1 on 1.  90% of the time their backup won't arrive unless a) he is needed for a group inside, or b) I am interferring with their plans some other way.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And I am not even taking into account MOBs.&quot;<br />
-I don't know about you, but every battle I have been in with another &quot;honorable&quot; PvPer, we both stop to kill the mob.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it is nothing like that. Your comparison is way off. With an unresistable snare, you cant get away, and you die. With rogues having this power, you can still always turn tale and run.

-It wasn't a comparison between the two at all, it was a comparison in disadvantage.  Adding that snare would make a druid almost unkillable, same with a rogue, shadowknight, or a necromancer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, seeing how you carry all your plat when you are out PKing, I can understand why you couldnt afford a better wep.&quot;<br />
-250pp does not equate to &quot;all my plat&quot;, especially since I generally gain more money from PvP then I lose.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you have spent anytime whatsoever on a pvp server, you know about shouts going up in a zone saying a pk raiding group is there&quot; and hell ya, see invis is passsed out, MR gear is put on, PvP buffs are tossed out, and mobs are not pulled till the situation is assesed.&quot;<br />
-I've never seen this done, not once.  Its actually pretty funny too, just about every time I go to KC I get a good chuckle out of it.  My group (I don't take KC solo like Splorge  ) would come in and kill the entrance groups NP.  What do we do next?  Go around the corner and kill the group pulling mobs WHILE the people at front were dieing.  Now you think that would be bad enough, but noooo, the group from across the way (on the other corner) are *STILL* pulling mobs.  Now, myself...yes I do prepare for PvP when I see the /who list.  I learned my lesson long ago by not doing so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to go off on this tangent, but I really didnt like the PvP server world to be so misrepresented.&quot;<br />

<br />
Right now there are 3 problems with it, IMO:<br />
<br />
1. The range of the 'shout' for guards when someone fails a pp attempt on you is very small.  Probably smaller than /say.<br />
<br />
2.  The guards never assist.  Even if you are standing right next to them when someone tries to pp you.  So if you are getting pp while banking, you can't fight back or the guards will kill you.<br />
<br />
3.  The 'shout' should have the name of the pp'er in it I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally i would rather this change be purely linked to evade, and that<br />
Invis shouldnt break target, it should merely just stop you fromc asting<br />
or shooting arrows. (ie if a rogue backstabs a warrior then quickly hits the hide button failing evade as the warrior hits the auto combat he should get shredded)<br />
<br />
My experience on Ralos as  Rogue is geting Zapped ata distance around cornersby people who cant see me, or the Warrior with the arrows that can still hit me despite the fact that he cant see me.<br />

I really dont see how this ability if done properly can be overpowerd, but that &quot;doneproperly&quot; is a tricky situation.</div></div><hr />

Try attacking, then /attack off - /hide and it will hide you and make the evade work as well, unless you get hit or move after hitting the /hide. <br />
