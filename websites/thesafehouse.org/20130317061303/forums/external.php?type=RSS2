			<title>Rob Portland: Should a sudden dose of empathy be praised or derided?</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So late yesterday, CNN came out with an interview with Rob Portman, talking about how he's come to terms with his gay son and now supports gay marriage. Prior, he was a cosponsor on DOMA, supported a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, and has otherwise championed discriminatory causes from the right.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-usa-portman-gaymarriage-idUSBRE92E0G020130315" target="_blank">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/...92E0G020130315</a><br />
<br />
The response from this revelation has been remarkably polarizing and I find it fascinating. Several outlets are pointing out that while it's nice that he's finally joined the right side of history on this one, his lack of empathy until he was directly effected by that discrimination is indicative of the entire conservative mindset (<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/15/1194260/-Sen-Rob-Portman-R-OH-Shows-Us-Exactly-Why-Republicans-Suck" target="_blank">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/0...publicans-Suck</a>), almost dismissing the fact that Portman has made a lot of powerful enemies by becoming the first sitting republican senator to back marriage equality.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm conflicted, I think it's a great gesture, and we shouldn't attack someone for coming around and changing their opinions, but it's also frustrating that he only took a critical introspective opinion of what his actions meant when it directly effected his family. How long would it have taken to change his opinion had his son Will suffered quietly in the closet?<br />
<br />
Edit: typoed the name.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So since Aion has been F2P for a while and I originally enjoyed the game. I decided to give it another spin. I have been itching for a good PVP, just run around and kill people and talk trash game. I figured it was a good time to return since the server population issues have stabilized and there should be plenty of targets.<br />
<br />
Now I went into this not having played in years..I knew I would get my ass steamrolled just due to being rusty on reflexes and ****. I was soon to be extremely disappointed. So the first thing I do is go kill a few mobs, refresh my memory on my skill rotations then find a rift and jump on over to Asmo land. At this point I start roaming and finding targets..and raping them. Seriously? I was expecting to die quickly, I am performing my rotations badly and missing all kinds of hotkeys and still winning? WTF? Ok fine..perhaps I just managed to get unlucky and end up in a patch of tards. So I decided to do a dungeon run.<br />
<br />
4.5 hours later (reminded why I hate no auto queue) I find a group. At this point I am bored nearly to the point of tears. So we get in the dungeon and are rolling along decently enough. Except the assassin is a moron who thinks shes a tank and keeps dying. After about 30 minutes of this, I finally have enough and speak up. &quot;Please stop charging in like a moron, let the tank get ****ing aggro before you unload everything&quot;. Oh this starts a huge fight. Everyone goes on this tangent of Don't curse...wait? what? WTF happened to this community? Err, you have a filter if you don't like vulgarity turn on the filter. It doesn't matter, cursing is against the rules and if you keep it up we will report you. &quot;The ****? This is a PVP game in case you forgot. Also I will talk any ****ing way I please and if you don't like it, turn on your goddamn filter, or go cry in a corner like the ***** you are. Either way I don't ****ing care. (I know I am getting kicked at this point, but don't care given I was sadly the only one in that group who could apparently do more than 1 thing at at time). So I get kicked and reported and sure enough a GM contacts me an hour later. [This is GM bagofdicks, we have a report of you using excessive language. As you know this is against our rules and blah blah blah blah blah.] Ok GM bagofdicks, if the rules are so strict against cursing why do we have a profanity filter? If they are so butthurt over profanity this should be on. I think the real problem is they were trash players, and don't want to deal with the fact that they are trash players and simply took their frustrations out on me for pointing this problem out. Which as you should realize is about as effective as someone who is fat and ugly smashing all mirrors and trying to pretend they aren't. [GM, Well it is against the rules and..quit reading] Big ****ing deal. This is a ****ing PVP game where last I recall through over a decade of this, vulgarity is normal. If people want to play in fantasy no cursing land, there are plenty of hello kitty type games where they can go be pussies all damn day. It isn't like these jackholes are paying customers either. [GM, your language is excessive, I am going to ban you for ...] You know what..**** off. Ban me whatever I am not coming back anyhow. This is utter and complete ******** to get reported and banned because a bunch of dried up ***** got offended in a PVP game at someone telling them they were bad. Especially when that person hasn't played in years and obviously isn't in top form and is Still playing ****ing better which is ****ing pathetic. So much for hardcore..apparently this game is full of giant bleeding pussies like yourself , the players and staff who believe everyone is a winner and a precious flower. <br />
<br />
/quit<br />
<br />
Was I a ****? Yes..yes I was. Do I care? Not a bit. Why? Because I am ****ing right and that is ****ing pathetic in a game like that. Don't want vulgarity? Don't play a competitive PVP game and stay in church.<br />
<br />
On that note, I am surprised I haven't gotten banned in LoL yet. Now I don't usually rant or go on tangents. However I will curse here and there or call someone a stupid jackass when they are being a stupid jackass. I expect the same when I am being a stupid jackass which happens from time to time. Given how ****ing anal Riot is about their shitty ass play nice policy, I am surprised. Well they called the summoners code, but same damn thing. Interestingly enough, I actually didn't agree to the summoners code and actually checked that option in my profile. Frankly I think the code is just outright ********. Until they give me the ability to leave a match when my team has retards on it and not get punished for simply wanting to play a good game, I reserve the right to be hostile to dirtbag players.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So last week we bought a new couch, at first the guy said it would be a few weeks to get it, but upon looking into it he saw that there was still one available at another shop. This one had money put down on it, but the jerkoff who wanted it had only put a few hundred down on it and hadn't paid anything since mid February, that money down is all he had paid on it. So the guy at the shop says he can just get that one sent to us that week. Well, that was sooner than what we really wanted, since we had to move stuff out of the room where the new bed purchased elsewhere was going to go and then move **** around in the living room for the couch, including moving the old couch out since they don't help with that.<br />
<br />
Get a call the next day saying they couldn't get it out last Friday, which was good since I think it would have killed us to move that much stuff that fast, as the bed was scheduled for Thursday. They say it would be Wednesday this week before it got to the warehouse. <br />
<br />
So what did we do this Tuesday? Finished moving everything that needed to be moved out, including getting rid of the couch. The couch was a pain in the ass to get in the house in the first place (I really don't remember it, I dunno if I was at school or something when we got it or what), and was going to be an equal pain in the ass getting it out, made worse since there's a desk and treadmill on the porch since they needed to be moved out of the bedroom and living room respectively. Took two hours or so to get that ****er out of the house, ended up cutting out the cushions on the seat and recliner part of the couch's last section and pulling up some of the wood on the recliner part since it wasn't fitting out of the door (this was the section that got sat in the most), didn't matter since the couch was busted anyway. <br />
<br />
Wednesday rolls around and we get no call from the furniture place.<br />
<br />
Called today to find out we aren't going to be getting that one and the soonest they will be shipping one would be the ****ing 25th. Had to call back later for more info from the guy we bought it from, he calls us back to tell use the ****ing ******* who had put money down on the couch was putting more down on it the night we bought it or something.<br />
<br />
So now I haven't got anything to sit in and watch TV. Looks like I need to drag some rocking chair thing we bought years ago downstairs to the living room so Im not just sitting on the damn floor. <br />
<br />
Seriously, **** you guy. I hope your new couch catches fire.</div>

This comes with a rogue useable aura: Guardian Circle I (+20 % dodge). Now I do wonder how long this aura does last. It says &quot;permanent&quot; but it fades after a few minutes already. There is no countdown timer and the description des not tell anything. Anyone an idea about this (or the lvl II or III version)?</div>
