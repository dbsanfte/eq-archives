<p><b> Please Check Your Systems</b></p>

<p>We are getting a lot of mail that contain the <b>Klez</b> Virus in it. Please go to this link <a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.h@mm.html" target="_blank"><b>HERE</b></a> and check your systems.<br />
<br />
Please Know that Dolby and I have very good virus software.. we will NEVER send you an email with a virus..<br />
<br />
also know the Klez virus hides itself by sending out emails saying they are from other people.<br />
<br />
sooo if you get an email from one of us, and it has the Klez virus in it.. someone you know, that has been here must be infected...<br />
<br />
Also please do not email us back asking if we think you are "stupid or someting" we did NOT send you a virus..<br />
<br />
I scan my system weekly, I know Dolby does as often.. I promise you it was not one of us.<br />
<br />

<p>If you look at the full email header of a infected email you will see the email came from some place else. The virus goes through your emails and address books and sets the sender email to one of those email address tricking you into thinking it was some one else. But like I said if you look at the full header (if your a geek you know what I'm talking about) the virus cant hide the real email server it was sent from only the reply-to address it changes.<br />
<br />
Luckly I'm not on to many peoples email address books and stuff so I havent gotten too many klez's.<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>

<p>Klez nasty.<br />
<br />
I am self-employed as a computer technician.  So far this year of all the virus removals I had to do, Klez has been 80% of all my service calls.<br />
<br />
So, I know I am free from it.<br />
<br />
If left on a system to long, it can be really nasty.</p>
