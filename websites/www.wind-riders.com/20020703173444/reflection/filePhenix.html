								<B>History:</B> Phenix, the younger brother of Raenewae, is an enigma of himself. Orphaned at birth, he came to reside in
           Surefall, and was taken in by a humble human druid. There he was shown the ways of the Jaggedpine Treefolk,
           and developed a deep respect for the animals around. He even raised a wolf named Fenrir. 

           <P>But the enigma that is Phenix is not without a sorrowful tale. One day, out in the Hills, poachers arrived and
           slaughtered all bears in sight. Phenix, his adopted father and Fenrir fought very bravely to destroy this plague, but
           alas were over come by their weapons and experience. Fenrir was killed, the druid mortally wounded, and Phenix
           barely escaped with an arrow in his left arm. It was then that Phenix was told by the dying druid about his true
           origins. </P>

           Phenix's would not ever know his mother, for she was a gypsie. But his father, as he was told, was a warrior from
           Qeynos, and was killed while trying to protect his family. <BR><BR>"Did the brigands kidnap me, father?"<BR>"Nay my son, for
           you were never meant to exist on the world. You are a bastard. Your father had never known of your
           existence. I offered to raise you, when it was told you were to be left to the wolves." 

           <P>And even though these words came from his "father", he had never in his life been as angry as he was this day.<BR><BR>
           "But take not sorrow to this story, my boy, for there is a brighter side to it. You have a half-brother, who although
           is not your full blood, exists as that family that you have never had. Seek out Raenewae of the Wind Riders, and
           tell him this news. Prove your bloodline by giving him the name "Stormryder", and tell him of your ventures. He
           would already be proud of you, as I have been for so long...."</P>

           And with that, Phenix buried both his father and his best friend, and set out to find his lost family... <BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> Phenix has been brave and loyal since I met him, well, that's pretty much since he was
								born. His brother Raenewae has been my friend since I was a little girl too. They're good folk.<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> Though I despise him less than his brother, this one tends to oversteps his bounds
								with things that don't belong to him. It will get him killed sooner or later. I prefer sooner.<BR><BR>
