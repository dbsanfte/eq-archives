                 <P>Canelon searched the vast dark plains into the wee hours of morning. Long after the
                 moon had abandoned him the sky began to show it's indecision of light and dark-
                 bathing the land in uneasiness. Sugan stumbled back into the distant horizon, tattered
                 and scratched as if she'd forcefully clawed her way out of whatever dark hell had
                 swallowed her. Cane ran and caught her up in his arms, crying out in relief.
                 He called her name and hugged her. Then the elf flinched and checked her for injuries.
                 When he saw none that were serious he hugged her again. Sugan just stood wearily,
                 staring at a spot near her feet the whole time. Canelon tensed at her lack of response.</P>
                 "Sugan, I was so afraid. Please tell me what happened. I was so worried, you out here
                 alone." and he added with a smile, "A blind little human."
                 <P>She didn't even crack a smile at one of her favorite jokes. Instead, Sug turned her
                 despair filled eyes to the distance.</P>
				 "I meant what I said, Angel. I can't be with you." she said, her voice cracking.
                 <P>Cane looked shattered. "Why, Sugan? please, I-"</P>
                 "I just can't. Cane, go find someone who deserves you. That someone isn't me." she
                 breathed.
                 <P>There was a pause, then Canelon's voice grew firm and stubborn. "No, Sugan I will
                 not find someone else. It is I who am lucky. You and I belong together; you know
                 this." he grasped her chin and turned her head, forcing her to look at him, "You know
                 this." Cane then released her and crossed his arms expectantly. "Now tell me what's
                 wrong."</P>
                 Something about his manner awakened and challenged her instincts. The girl's eyes
                 flashed. "All right Cane." she nodded spitefully. "I'll tell you what's wrong. It's me. I'm
                 damned. I'm cursed. I'm <I>evil</I>. That's all."
                 <P>Cane leaned back skeptically. "That old curse thing? No, you were cured of that long
                 ago."</P>
                 Sugan shook her head violently in impatience. "You don't understand. I am still cursed.
                 I know I am because I <I>killed</I> someone..." she stopped suddenly, as shocked by her
                 own words as the elf was.
                 <P>She started to cry. Canelon drew her near again, sitting them both down in the course
                 dewy plains grass. In a grim, nearly paternal tone he said, "tell me."</P>
                 In between breaths and sobs, Sugan surrendered to him her nightmarish experience, "It
                 was a long time ago, when I had just started down my path to knighthood. I had just
                 met back up with my brother, and in my ego, often flaunted the power I thought I had.
                 I mocked his god and the curse whenever I was able.
                 <P>One day near the cabins I saw Faileas circling a boy our age, taunting him and pushing
                 him around. I knew the boy to be an apprentice cleric of the Temple of Life and ran to
                 his aid." Sugan took on a tired, amused half smile, "Through our combined
                 unpleasantness, we chased Faileas off. Although I saw him still watching from the
                 shadows, I wasn't worried. He wasn't like he is now. He never really hurt anyone in
                 those days..."</P>
                 Cane waited patiently as she cried through a new wave of sadness brought by her
                 memories. 
                 <P>Eventually she continued. "...I kept him in the corner of my eye, as I brashly accepted
                 the cleric's praise. Thought I was such a hero. Then something happened." Sugan's
                 eyes grew wide and glassy, reliving it in her mind.</P>
                 "Everything grew dark; a thick black smoke seemed to cover the ground. I looked
                 around wildly, but couldn't see what was causing it. The boy I was talking to was
                 smiling strangely, and then he made some arcane gesture with his hand. He began to
                 change shape in front of me. I was so afraid.
                 <P>Before I could think to run, he stood before me completely transformed. It was my
                 father. He was wearing the robes of his precious Bertoxxulous, and followed by that
                 hideous rotting <I>thing</I>" Sugan spoke through gritted teeth, "My first thought was 'A
                 trap, Faileas lured me into a trap,' and I drew my sword. The image of my mother's
                 spilt blood blinded me with rage and I attacked. I don't know what I did to him, but it
                 was bad. Darkness and blood, both in great quantities. And when it was over,"</P>
                 The girl went deathly pale, and Canelon feared she would pass out. Her words were
                 barely audible. "i stood there looking down at his body. it was horribly mangled,
                 crumpled and bleeding. and it wasn't my father. it was that boy, and he was
                 whimpering, he was still <I>alive</I>-"
                 <P>At this the elf thought <I>he</I> would pass out. But Sugan kept on. "I dropped my sword.
                 My brother crept out of his his hiding place. He was shaking, and seemed very scared.
                 He kept looking back to me with this face, I don't know what it was... and then he
                 changed. Faileas picked up my sword and turned me around. I still heard the thing
                 whimpering and it was driving me insane. Then there was a dull grisly crunch and
                 silence"<P>
                 It was a few moments before Cane realized she'd stopped talking. "W-what did you
                 do then?" he swallowed.
                 <P>"Faileas took me back to Qeynos. Left me at my temple and went back. I don't know
                 what he did then." she stated stiffly. "But no one found out. He saved me from that
                 much." Sugan returned to the worn state she had appeared in.</P>
                 Canelon shook his head sadly. "My poor Sugan" he said, rocking her. She got upset.
                 <P>"I'm not your 'poor Sugan', don't you get it?! I can't be yours, I'm a murderer!" she
                 shouted.</P>
                 "You're no such thing! It was a trick, a game Faileas played with you!" Cane shouted
                 back. Sugan looked sadly down. "No, it wasn't Faileas. The look on his face- he was
                 so innocent. No he couldn't have had that kind of power."
                 <P>Canelon sounded desperate, "Well then it was an illusion by the god then... anything. I
                 <I>know</I> you're not a murderer, Sugan!" he pleaded.</P>
                 Sugan met his gaze then, and saw he was hoping against hope. Something inside her
                 gave way. "Maybe you're right. Maybe it wasn't totally my fault." she sighed.
                 The elf released his breath. "You see? We can be together." Canelon stood up and
                 pulled Sug to her feet too.
                 <P>"No," Sugan corrected, "we can't. That's why I promised to never let myself fall in love
                 and marry. If I'm still cursed it would corrupt and haunt you too. I cannot allow that to
                 happen. Not to you."</P>
                 Cane's eyes flashed with brilliantly feral defiance then. He took the girl's dirty hand.
                 "Sugan, I Vow to you that I will rid you of this curse." he growled, "I don't care if I
                 have to find Tunare-- kill Bertoxxulous himself, so be it. I don't care. I'll save you. And
                 then you can be my wife."
                 <P>Thus said, he brought out the beautiful jewelled ring and placed it back on her finger.</P>
                 "A symbol of my promise." Canelon lifted her hand and gave it a delicate kiss; his gaze
                 never faltering.</DIV></TD>
