								<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top" WIDTH="510"><DIV CLASS="main"><P>I awoke on this fine new day....
									with a hangover. It seems I had a bit too much mead for someone with such a low alcohol
									tolerance. Well this made it a bit hard to sing (seeing as my head felt as if an enchanter
									had scrambled my brain), so I had to withold singing any of my songs until the pain passed
									me by.</P>

									<P>All the while my stomach was growling at me, and my throat was parched from all the
									singing I did the previous night. So I checked my large bags to see what form of food and
									water I had purchased lately, and I found some muffins and some flasks of water. I wasn't
									in the mood for muffins this morning so I looked for something else, and found some batwing
									crunchies that my lovely leader, and very shiney paladin as of late, gave to me. So batwing
									crunchies it was (heh wow, they were rather tasty, just need to drink something with them).
									As the last one was crunched up and in my stomach fixing the growling and the water that
									followed each bite helped my throat, I also noticed my hangover was no longer there and my
									head felt fine. Funny thing is I'm not sure if it was the crunchies themselves, or if it was
									the thoughts of Sug that eased my pain; but either way I was back in good shape and ready to
									travel.</P>
									
									<P>So as I ran through the city and newbie grounds (Selo's Accelerendo flowing from my lips
									of course) I began thinking back on the days that have gone by and some past memories that
									qeynos always seems to rouse up. The times spent retreiving my corpse from the ravaging of
									the Queen Kliknick because she didnt like me picking on her weaker brethren. The many
									get-togethers, some planned, and others impromptu surprises. Also the nasty Darkpaws, who
									scowled at me for hunting their pups.</P>
									
									<P>Possibly somewhat disturbing to some, but thoughts of the gnolls brought up a very warming
									recolection. It was of the time I was looking for some people to hunt with. Seeing as I was
									still rather new to battle I was forced to shout for a group. Just when I was about to give
									up and head back into Qeynos to rest for the day, I heard a lovely and angelic
									voice behind me ask if I was still looking to group. I turned to see a leather clad woman,
									looking oh so saintly, and a man also donning leather, but his look was vague as he seemed
									to be surrounded by shadows. They introduced themselves as Faileas, a shadowknight of
									Bertoxxulous, and Sugan, a paladin of Karana. The first thing that came to mind was how strange
									it was for a shadownight (pure evil) and a paladin (pure divinity) to be hunting together.
									Well I forget exactly who it was, but one of them suggested that we try hunting in Blackburrow,
									the underground den of the gnolls who inhabited the lands around Qeynos. We all agreed and off
									we went to do some gnoll hunting. </P>
									
									<P>The weirdest thing I remember about that day of hunting was when we attacked our first
									gnoll. Sugan initiated the attack, so I spun around the back to get in some easy shots
									(I honestly forget what Faileas was doing, after the introduction I couldnt get my eyes or
									thoughts to wander away from Sugan). As I started singing my Chant of Battle, to heighten our
									adrenaline rush and aid us in the fight, I looked straight ahead past our burly advesary,
									right at Sugan. What caught my attention wasn't her fighting style, or her toughness, but
									there was a physical feature that I didn't notice at first; it was her eyes.  The fury I
									noticed in them surpassed everything I've ever known. Everything, that is, besides the wrath
									of Karana himself and the tempest that is his to comand.</P>
									
									<P>As I reminisced I managed to pass by the giant stone gnoll head, which served as the
									entrance to Blackburrow. As I stood there, arms crossed, just smiling and remembering for
									a bit, a group of newbie adventurers passed by. I noticed the difference between them by the
									way they entered the cave, one rushed right in, and the others followed in suit (heh one of
									them was scared stiff, literally he froze right in front of the gnoll mouth and eventually
									turned and ran away). One of them had a fury similar to the one I remembered seeing in Sugans
									eyes, it wasnt the one who rushed right in, rather just a female who jogged in behind him.
									I could see by the look in her eyes, and the way she carried herself she would turn out to be
									a great fighter and leader one day. I knew this because it is what I saw happen to the angelic,
									yet brazen, Sugan.</P>
									
									<P>And as the group passed I noticed on amongst them who reminded me of an old face, one
									I met here at this same spot one day. He was a half elf paladin, wrapped up in shiny brass
									armor, and a leather whip with barbs along the tip of it in his hands...</P>
