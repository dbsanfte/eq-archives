                 <P>A familiar expression crossed the paladin's face as she looked up from the letter.</P>
                 Worry.
                 <P>She did not enjoy compromising to the will of the demon Malgorm, but this letter left
                 her little choice. It read:</P>

                 Dear Sugan (my weaker half)

                 <P>I hope you like the army I have built? I have killed many; attacking the world of
                 Norrath. It was to be your job but it seems you did not have the will to handle it. So I
                 make sure to tell every one who falls by my hand that I am doing it for you. It is a great
                 sight to watch... the life pours from their eyes and the shock of death, and to think!
                 Their last thoughts will be of you. That is a great honor, you know. A gift I give to my
                 benefactor. <BR>
                 I have gathered two of the texts of Azzothoth and I only need one more, but it seems
                 the texts read something quite interesting. They speak of some events that are not clear
                 to me, so I thought perhaps we could trade information. I have knowledge you can use
                 and you have knowledge I can use. So meet me near Lake Rathetear at the arena and
                 we can speak.<BR>
                 You have my word, my magick will not harm you, though I cannot speak so freely of
                 my disciples. So perhaps you should bring a champion and a healer for protection. Oh,
                 and bring your brother, the great Lord Faileas. Any one else and with a word I will be
                 gone. <BR>
                 I know you are saying 'why risk my life?'. I am sure you think this is a trap. But I
                 assure you, you will never stop me if you do not gain the information that I have. But if
                 you are too afraid I understand, it would not be the first sign of weakness you have
                 shown. Perhaps you should just cower in a corner and cry, but just remember I am
                 here because of you, Sugan! I am your demon and if I achieve my goal it would still be
                 all thanks to you.</P>

                 Malgorm of Azzothoth

                 <P>With a disgusted sigh, Sugan crunched the paper in her fist and hit the tavern wall.
                 Patrons of the place looked up once, but paid little attention. If there was one thing to
                 be expected from Sugan Imshee'Cro, it would be the stormy anger she displayed at
                 the actions of her brother and this demon. Even in the strange walls of Highpass Hold
                 this was common knowledge.</P>
                 Across the table from her, the bard Serenade watched her with dark eyes. He
                 frowned and reached for the note with concern. Sugan, absorbed in thought, stuffed it
                 in the backpack on the floor and stood up. As she put on her cloak, Serenade reached
                 under the table and quickly plucked the letter from it's spot. He hid it away just as she
                 turned and picked her backpack up. Their eyes met for an instant with silent
                 acknowledgement, then Sugan nodded her farewell and darted out the door into the
                 night.
                 <P>Serenade wasn't offended at her quick retreat. It wasn't the first time, and would
                 probably not be the last that Sugan left in haste. Instead of dwelling on it, the bard
                 finished his drink and went upstairs to read the letter.</P>
                 Outside, the knight's determined steps gained the attention of her travelling companions
                 Thryn and Phenix, who were talking nearby in the torchlight. They hesitated for a mere
                 second at Sugan's expression and then hurried after, barely keeping the wisps of her
                 red hair in sight. Both half elves, they perked their sensitive ears at the energy that was
                 gathering in the air. The winds spoke of unease.
                 <P>The paladin, bard, and ranger left the walls of Highpass Hold and started down the
                 steep narrow path. It was a dangerous route to the plains, but the only one available.
                 A sheer drop to the black depths below forced travelers to hug the mountains and step
                 carefully. Finally after endless treading the path gave way to open plains. Upon
                 crossing the first bridge Thryn and Phenix were wondering amongst themselves what
                 their business was, but didn't think it the time to ask Sugan. She hurried on without
                 resting or acknowledging the nocturnal beauty of her homelands; unusually silent.</P>
                 Thryn gave her a questioning look in the darkness that she did not return.
                 <P>The paladin fingered the jewel of a necklace she had wrapped around her wrist, in
                 thought. The necklace, a gift from her Teir'Dal friend Vailia, was more a thing of
                 usefulness than beauty. It allowed Sugan to see in the dark without having to summon
                 a halo of light. Now it served to relieve some stress as well.</P>
                 Sugan had a plan. She was heading for Lake Rathetear as requested in the letter, but
                 not for the letter's reason. It was true she suspected a trap, and by no means would
                 she ever trust the word of a demon... by doing exactly as he asked may be the mistake
                 that allowed him victory, instead of the other way around. There was her brother
                 Faileas too, who she could feel planning and scheming, but recently was striding the
                 gray edge of the law. Her spies reported nothing 'bad' per se, but trouble was
                 nevertheless present. Then there was the situation with Ayna and her recently
                 discovered Lexior. And then Serenade...
                 <P>Many questions riddled her heart, and since Jamier made his presence scarce after
                 their confrontation in the Estate of Unrest, Sugan felt Karana's wisdom lingering just
                 out of reach. She could think of nothing she had done wrong, and decided perhaps it
                 was time to seek out divine help instead of waiting for it to seek her. In the mountains
                 bordering Lake Rathetear were rumored to be two Sphinxes of great power, one
                 possessing knowledge of light and the other shadow. Sugan was going to find this
                 Sphinx of light, and pray that it could serve as an oracle of the gods' will. The closer
                 she got, the more it called out to her.</P>
                 After passing the enormous chains supporting the wooden bridge, the paladin and her
                 friends turned sharply left and followed the river's edge. In a while they came upon the
                 tower and wizard's arches marking the entrance to the southern plains of Karana.
                 Made of white stone, they glowed softly in the dim light of the moon. The watchtower
                 was carved with a likeness of Sugan's beloved rainkeeper god, and feeling strangely
                 closer to him than she had in some time, Sugan offered a small prayer and entered.
                 She thought differently of pausing to speak to Brother Nallin up the twisting tower
                 stairs however, and went through to cross the second bridge instead.
                 <P>Somewhere during the straight run through South Karana, Phenix asked Sugan what
                 they were doing. She replied merely that her quest called from the mountains. Thryn
                 shrugged at the ranger's confused look, and they continued until the waters of Lake
                 Rathetear stopped them. Thryn pulled a small boat up and invited them to climb in.
                 For hours they scanned the dark shores, looking for something resembling a pass into
                 the great mountains. Thryn guided them along the entire lake but nothing was easily
                 seen. The boat drifted to a gentle halt on an isle that sat in the middle, and the
                 exhausted passengers stumbled out. Sugan sprinted along the island's edge and
                 scanned the moonlit beaches of the horizon. Nothing. A heavy fog rolled in over the
                 waters then, and it began to rain.</P>
                 Phenix approached the girl as she sat drearily on the rocks at the waters edge, and
                 told her of a nearby tower they could stay in for the rest of the night. She stood and
                 turned to follow him, but hesitated. Anger coursed through her at the thought of more
                 delay, and Sugan drew her holy sword. She closed her eyes and held it high in homage
                 of the heavens' wisdom. The Falchion of the Koada'Vie flashed brightly as lightening
                 coursed through the sky, and they looked up in time to see it strike the earth ahead.
                 Without hesitation, Sugan dove into the water. Phenix called back for Thryn, and then
                 followed. The bard sighed as he left the warm dry tower, grumbling sarcastically about
                 their judgement on swimming in thunderstorms, and jumped in as well.
                 <P>After safely crossing the now storm-tossed lake, they found that the place was indeed
                 a pass into the Rathe Mountains. Quietly sneaking over the highest rocks and peaks,
                 the three hoped to see what sort of land the valleys were. A great many bears and
                 lizardmen roamed below, and they cautiously continued into morning.</P>
                 Suddenly there was a great roar, and they were nearly smashed by a huge monster
                 from behind. The thing had one giant eye, and Phenix quickly identified it as he ran,
                 yelling, 'Cyclops!' They darted back towards the pass, hoping it would not follow.
                 <P>Spotting a fire and some tents closer, Thryn pulled them in the direction. There were
                 gypsies camped there, who laughed as Sugan and her friends dove inside one. They
                 were still laughing when the three crept out and asked if it was gone.</P>
                 Sugan lead her friends back to the pass near the lake, apologized, and asked them not
                 to risk following her. Thryn argued against it, and Phenix chimed in… but she wouldn't
                 have it and ordered them away. Saluting their help, Sugan turned again to the
                 mountains.
                 <P>She wandered carefully over the vast peaks for a day, looking for any sign of the
                 Sphinx. There were many sights and marvels of nature, but nothing of what she sought.
                 Many gypsies roamed the Rathe Mountains, who graciously let her rest in their camp
                 when she passed. The trees here were enormous, and wind passing through sounded
                 like the cry of lost souls. At dusk, among the tall pines there appeared a fierce dark elf
                 in plate armor, black as night and stained with old blood. As he passed Sugan they
                 caught each other's gaze. The Teir'Dal smirked from under a skull-like mask when she
                 saw the symbol of loyalty to her brother Faileas. Continuing without a word, Sugan
                 turned only once to look behind. He was gone.</P>
                 Exhausted and sullen, the paladin plopped down in a bed of soft vinelike plants and
                 frowned in the dark. She didn't realize it, but they were the first tendrils of plant life
                 from the swamps of Feerott. All Sugan knew was that she was lost and not
                 accomplishing her goals, and right when she grew upset at this, Vailia appeared.
                 <P>There were no puffs of purple smoke, no flashes of brilliant light or loud fancy bangs…
                 The magician was just was 'there', standing with crossed arms and a smile, always the
                 one to save the day. Sugan couldn't help but smile back at the red-robed dark elf
                 thankfully. After Sug explained her situation, Vailia thought for a second and
                 scampered off, pulling her friend along.</P>
                 After a short run Vailia cut into a nearly unnoticeable valley. Here it seemed was a
                 wide round plain, with a plateau sort of island in the middle. Echoes of loud cries from
                 creatures unknown bounced off the walls in the darkness. Great shadowy beasts flew
                 slowly along, small for dragons but much bigger than humans or dark elves. 'Ebon
                 Drakes', Vailia called them. Sugan considered them briefly, then followed as Vailia
                 climbed up onto the plateau. The magician stood with her back to a large slab of
                 upcropped stone, and put a finger to her lips for silence.
                 <P>The paladin crept up beside her and nodded. Vailia pointed around the rock's side and
                 motioned for Sugan to peek. What she saw made her gasp involuntarily, to which the
                 dark elf replied with a hand clamped over Sugan's mouth. They looked at each other,
                 and Vailia giggled quietly. Then the two tried to sneak closer for a better look.</P>
                 Beyond them, and surrounded by lizardmen, was a huge golden creature with the head
                 of a woman, the body of a lion, and the wings of an eagle. She was several times the
                 size of the black drakes though, and her golden and jeweled armor reflected the fire of
                 her glittering red eyes. Her screams were the echoes they'd heard. This was a Sphinx
                 alright, but Sugan sensed a darkness emanating from her soul that didn't bode
                 welcome. After shivering off her unease, Sugan told Vailia her search was not at an
                 end.
                 <P>Starting off on the same foot now, as neither of them knew how to start looking for the
                 other Sphinx, Vailia tried to determine from the valley where the other could possibly
                 be. They wandered about again for a long while, and decided to find a spot to rest. On
                 the horizon glowed a couple small fires, and large white tents were illuminated by the
                 moon. Drawing close, Sugan noticed many men and women in shiny plate armor. She
                 recognized a familiar face and some laughter… A camp of Paladins! With hugs and
                 hello's they welcomed her, and she introduced Vailia, who they welcomed as well. It
                 was a while they rested here, with many stories and news passed over a hot meal.
                 Vailia discovered a cart on the edge of the camp in which a gypsy woman lived. She
                 frowned at the dark elf until she noticed a small trinket that Vailia had worn since
                 childhood. The woman grinned at Vailia then as a sister would, and invited her in for
                 drinks.</P>
                 It was with light hearts and warmth that they left the camp on their quest again,
                 enlightened by what information the gypsy had on the location of the light Sphinx. 
                 However, they found themselves lost shortly thereafter. Again Sugan wondered why
                 she was not feeling pulled by Karana in the right direction. For a long time they
                 crossed what were becoming familiar landmarks in the mountains.
                 <P>They came upon a tower of sorts, more like a glowing monolith with strange symbols
                 marking the walls. Beside it was a monster unseen at first, because of it's size. Quickly
                 recoiling when it was spotted, Sugan and Vailia scowled at their near death at the
                 hands of a giant skeleton. Standing again, Sugan coated them both in magick hidden to
                 the undead, and Vailia crept closer to investigate. She returned a bit later, excited that
                 she'd found a necromancer hidden inside. Apparently this evil gnome was someone
                 Vailia was asked to track down and kill, but the undead things around the place would
                 spot her if she tried now. Sugan told her that they would return here someday soon
                 with friends to aid her. Vailia nodded in agreement, and they resumed the search.</P>
                 After a while they came across a totem like platform, on which sat a beautiful,
                 iridescent, bluegreen scarab. Two more sat across the way, opposite of each other.
                 An aura of goodness surrounded the place, and Sugan and Vailia felt they weren't far
                 off. The paths from this point lead off in at least three directions, however, one being
                 the way they came. The many choices frustrated the paladin, who by now was sick of
                 mountains. Vailia giggled and serenely closed her eyes, encouraging Sugan to do the
                 same. She spoke softly of faith and patience, praying the gods would hear.
                 <P>Suddenly a far off rumble came from the distant horizon. The mountains themselves
                 seemed to be speaking, and Vailia perked her ears gleefully at the sound of falling
                 rocks some ways away. Listening for the direction, she ran down the valley as the
                 ground trembled beneath her. Sugan stumbled behind in awe.</P>
                 They came upon a great cloud of dust as the clatter faded away; a few pebbles
                 trickled down from what was once solid rock wall. A new passage had opened. The
                 paladin and magician climbed over the rubble with wide eyes, and started into this
                 hidden canyon with wonder.
                 <P>It was a long walk and there were many brambles and rocks to pass, but in the
                 distance a light appeared. Over a steep hill it grew brighter, and enveloped the entire
                 pass. The golden creature's great wings caused a perpetual breeze as she hovered
                 near a shaped stone with her symbol on it. Like the other, she was a breathtaking
                 vision encased in the jeweled armor. Sugan and Vailia drew closer timidly, but jumped
                 back in surprise when the Sphinx spoke magick words and was bathed in a shield of
                 fire. Vailia gulped and stood back; both she and Sugan agreed the Sphinx may not
                 safely understand that Vailia was Teir'Dal in blood only.</P>
                 Sugan approached her alone, and didn't flinch when the Sphinx' soul-piercing eyes
                 looked into her heart. The paladin knelt before the Sphinx of light, who gazed for a
                 long while as if intrigued at what she saw, and then nodded. Sugan looked back at
                 Vailia in silent thanks, and settled before the Sphinx with hopes of receiving answers to
                 questions that burned in her mind.
                 <P>The voice of the Sphinx was like a cool wind in one's thoughts, hinting at endless
                 patience. Sugan asked her about the note from the demon, and whether she ought to
                 meet with him. Her answer was yes, as nothing could be accomplished otherwise,
                 good or bad. Then the creature chuckled as the human rambled on about her brother,
                 this and that worry, and so on… Sugan blinked at her with a slightly offended look,
                 and the Sphinx smiled.</P>
                 She told the paladin to stop avoiding what really troubled her, which unraveled, would
                 help solve many problems after it. The matters of the heart were most important, and
                 once Sugan stopped hiding from herself in that respect, Karana would once again
                 bestow his wisdom. Sugan stopped cold, and then nodded slowly at the Sphinx'
                 words, asking in wonder where her knowledge came from. 
                 <P>The Sphinx replied, "They are inside you, little one."</P>
                 -:-:-:-:-
                 <P>Many days later Sugan emerged from her sanctuary, glowing with peace of mind that
                 the golden creature emanated. She informed the Wind Riders of her impending
                 meeting with Malgorm, and went in search of her brother and those who would
                 accompany them to the bloodstained Arena in Lake Rathetear.</P></DIV></TD>
