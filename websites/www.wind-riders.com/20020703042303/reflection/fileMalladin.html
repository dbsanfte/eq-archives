								<B>History:</B> Malladin Endracos is a servant of Rodcet Nife.  He has been served a privilege, assigned a key role in a quest that touches the lives of
						all in Norrath, and reaches up to the God's themselves.  He was born and raised on this soil, perhaps the same soil you yourself stand
						on at this moment.  But, he is not from this time.  He has come back from the future to set certain matters right, to make things as they
						should be.<BR><BR>
						In your future, Malladins present, something terrible happens.  Evil becomes dominant in the land.  Forces of darkness amass and unite
						to destroy the peace that prevails.  The situation was not sudden though.  For years, it seemed more and more as if the God's had
						turned their backs on their faithful servants.  One day, a day not soon forgotten, Innoruuk pronounced throughout the land, that he was
						now sole God, and ruler.  The other God's had been banished, banished to who knows where.  Soon after, evil prevailed throughout the
						land, and all those who sought a path of light were hunted and killed, or forced into hiding.  Something had to be done. There were so
						many, so many evil beings, and so few righteous.  But they could not give up.  For years they were forced to live in hiding, an
						underground society.  Vampiric forces hunted them at night, serving their new God without question.  Many of the Paladins, who were
						now wanted, would return the favor, by hunting the Vampires in retaliation.  This group, about forty strong, formed the Ronin`Dracos
						alliance.  They vowed to live by the Valiant Pact, which was as follows, "to serve, protect, heal.  To die for another.  There is no greater
						honor."  <BR><BR>
						But the vampiric forces were almost endless.  One of such hunters, Malladin, who now served in his deceased fathers place, decided
						that more was neccesary.  In his charge, the alliance of Knights decided that they couldnt just stand around while evil reigned any
						longer.  Their cause had been valiant, but it had not been nearly enough.  So they sought the help of any who were willing.  They banded
						together.  High elves and wood elves, Erudites and Dwarves, all who were willing, and stood up to fight back against the evil. There
						were even many dragonfolk who joined in the cause.<BR><BR>
						So they planned, and arranged a decisive attack, and carried it forth.  But they failed.  Many died in the battle.  Malladin, who had
						always seemed invincible, stood there, alongside his good friend Endraken, the dragon, and looked at the battlefield.  Only a few
						remained, and of those, many were injured.  In an instant, a red dragon flew overhead, landing one hundred yards in front of them. 
						Several wurms came to his side.  Malladin knew who this was.  It was his grandfather.  A shapeshifting dragon, who changed his form
						into that of a human, and masqueraded as such.  At one time, this dragon changed his shape, and walked among men. He took a wife,
						and bore a son, all out of curiosity.  He thought it would be fun.  But this dragon was evil.  Eventually he grew tired of the woman and
						killed her.  The child was found by a knight who was returning from some quest.  The knight was walking along the road, when he heard
						a baby crying from a house up a walkway.  The house looked like it had been hit by a stampede of rhinos.  He searched fervantly
						through the wreckage, and found the baby, scratched and bruised, but alive.<BR><BR>
						He took it to the temple in Qeynos, and left it with the clerics and Paladins.  They raised the child as their own.  This child grew to
						become a knight himself.  He took a wife, and they bore a son, Malladin.<BR><BR>
						The Dragon leered at Malladin, and said, "My own flesh and blood would fight against me!  Here this child!  You will fight, and you will
						kill, and claim to act with righteous will, but the time has come for you to see, what pain your actions bring, Ill say this once, let it be
						known, you shall not feel a thing!"<BR><BR>
						 
						All at once the dragons charged, and Malladin was knocked unconsious in the scuffle.  He awoke inside a cave that he recognized,
						Endrakens cave.<BR><BR>
						"Are you alright?" a deep, calm voice asked.  "Malladin, you will not believe what I am about to tell you.  Are you listening?  That dragon,
						your grandfather, he cursed you somehow, and then struck you with magicks that not even an army could have survived.  Yet you live. 
						Do you know what this means?  It is as I expected.  You are immortal.  For some reason, this effect, skipped your father.  But these are
						the results of the dragon mating with an elf.  You have a gift, do you understand?  You have something that every creature yearns for! 
						You are immortal!"<BR><BR>
						Malladin sat there, expressionless.  "What happened?  Where is everyone?"<BR><BR>
						"They were killed." the dragon replied.<BR><BR>
						"All of them?" Malladin asked.  "I cannot believe it.  my friends.  Dead.  But Endraken, something is wrong here."<BR><BR>
						"It doesnt faze me in the least.  I feel neither sadness, nor anger, nor a want for revenge.  I simply feel nothing."<BR><BR>
						"I see." said Endraken. " I know now what that curse was, the curse the red dragon uttered before he attacked you.  Its a spell, that
						strips you of your emotion.  Its intent is to cause you to turn on your friends, to turn your back on them."<BR><BR>
						 
						"There is still honor in me.  That I can feel.  It is in my blood." Malladin replied.  "I am a Paladin."<BR><BR>
						 
						"But all hope is lost now." Malladin said.<BR><BR>
						"No, there is one more thing we must try.  There is a spell, that has never been uttered before by my lips.  In the book you carry, the
						book the knight found among the ruins of your fathers home.  It is your grandfathers spell book.  The spell can send you back in time. 
						You can go back in time, and find a way to stop all of this before it starts!"<BR><BR>
						 
						But to what time should he be sent?  This was a question not easily answered.  Those who were left of the alliance, those who were not
						fighters, were mostly farmers, and scholars, historeans and learners.  They decided to search ancient documents, history books and
						such, perhaps to locate a appropriate time to send Malladin back to.<BR><BR>
						One such manuscript, told of ancient heros, and ancient guilds, who fought for what was right.  One of such guilds, were the cloud
						walkers. (loose translation from ancient common, no doubt refering to the Wind Riders)<BR><BR>
						It was decided that Malladin would travel to this time, and seek the aid of these noble ones.  Perhaps, with their help, they could save
						the future.<BR><BR>
						 
						So here he is today, serving among the Wind Riders.  Together, along with all who are willing, they will set things straight.<BR><BR>
						(His mission of averting his terrible future completed, Malladin silently departed this realm one night. He left in his wake a feeling of hope, of fond memories, and awakened a special gift in each of his allies.
						Malladin Endracos will always be revered as a Hero, and greatly missed.)<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> His prophecies frightened me, but I also had faith in him. With Malladin's wisdom we averted the destruction of his dismal future. And he left me a valuable secret...<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> Malladin once told me I would die a noble death, as a Knight of Thunder. He was a horrible fortune teller. "Wind Rider" wasn't the best day job, either. Probably paid less.<BR><BR>
