                      The son that almost was

                      <P>Jamier kneeled before the large woman. Milady you are so full of wisdom I
                      beg of you to help me. Ralnia snorted at the young Dark elf and then broke
                      into a chuckle. Jamier didn’t know whether to smile or feel humiliated as he sat
                      before her in the quiet corner of the guildhalls. He could hear the laughter in the
                      next room. He looked around the corner and sighed deeply as he watched
                      sugan's glistening red hair in the light. “What is it dark one?” ralnia asked a little
                      concerned. “I am in love and I don’t know what to do..I am in love with
                      someone who I know could never love me back” Ralnia leaned forward eager
                      to hear more. “and who is this woman that you are in love with?” ….Jamier
                      paused for a long moment “Sugan” Ralnia paused herself for a long moment
                      not sure of what to say.</P>

                      “I am not sure..” before she could finish. “I mean could you love someone like
                      me? Look at my skin ..could you call me son? Or say that you loved me?”
                      Jamier sat almost depressed with his own words. Ralnia Laughed uproarasly
                      “Look at grymtooth I call him son!” Jamier turned to glance at the troll and
                      shuddered “Ok you win a point”

                      <P>Ralnia took Jamiers hand. “perhaps if I adopted you it would help you to have
                      an honorable title..let me ask sorcere”.. Ralnia stood up “Sorcere Love!
                      Could..” Jamier’s eyes widened as he interupted her again. He began to feel
                      insecure. “No don’t” he whispered. Ralnia mumbled to Sorcere “Nevermind”
                      as Sorcere turned away. “what?!” Ralnia asked a little frustrated. “He hates
                      me..and besides I can’t” jamier replied as a single tear was tactfully being
                      hidden at the memory of his own mother who died but not a month before.</P>

                      Ralnia couldn’t believe it..her patience was being tried “You do realize that I
                      only offer this chance once, the next time YOU will have to prove yourself
                      worthy to be called any son of mine!” Jamier looked solemnly He wanted so
                      bad to have a family “yes MiLady I understand it just that its too fresh after the
                      death of my own mother” Ralnia didn’t have time for this she got up from her
                      chair and turned to leave. Jamier knew he was not trusted within the halls.
                      With a quick motion jamier pulled his sword and held it and stared a long
                      moment at the barbarian. The guild hall went silent as sirynn shouted “Jamier
                      what are you doing!” Jamier couldn’t explain that he was lost, frozen, locked
                      into something special within the barbarians green eyes. He couldn’t put a
                      finger on it. Quickly he snapped to a salute. Ralnia was enraged with Sorcere
                      at her side “I demand what the meaning of this is! You ask for my help then
                      threaten to attack me!” he vioce only echoed the anger she felt.

                      <P>“No m’lady I only wanted to salute a great woman and that I am sorry I could
                      not accept your offer”</P>

                      Sorcere enraged “what offer is this?!” Jamier looked helpless. Ralnia softened
                      “I invited him into our family” …Sorcere blinked “but..HE …HE …He is one
                      of them! A Dark elf!” Jamier turned shocked yet not . “What about me being a
                      dark elf?” Sugan stepped over ..”Jamier Calm down you knew this could
                      happen” . Jamier couldn’t bring himself to let it drop. “You know nothing
                      about me Sorcere!” He retaliated.

                      <P>“On the contrarty dark one I know all about you..and I cant put my finger on it
                      but I WILL PROVE SOMETHING” Sorcere’s hatred was not even
                      attempted to be hidden. Jamier saddened “How long must I pay for my fathers
                      sins?” his vioce soft and in a moment of reflection. “its in your skin Jamier!”
                      Sorcere’s lashing just wouldn’t quit. “Father maybe he jees neeedz a chanz
                      like meez”..Jamier never expected Grymtooth to come to his aide. Defiantly
                      Jamier began stripping himself naked before the high elven enchanter . Ralnia
                      averted her eyes and blushed at the site of Jamier’s naked appearance. “If it is
                      my skin the peel it off and look whats inside me for once!” Sorcere turned “are
                      you sure!” he was now going to put that dark elf in his place.</P>

                      Making preperations for a possible trap, he began the spell to pear into the
                      young warriors soul.

                      <P>During the commotion the halls were distracted by silveranns entrance, as he
                      explained about his child with envy. Jamiers heart ached as he watched the
                      woman he loved slump in pain and tears at the news. Jamier Wanted so bad to
                      hold her, to tell her all would be well. Naked tho he was he kneeled before her
                      and gently wiped away the tears.” M’lady you have the 4 winds to guide you.”
                      His concern only faded in the pain she felt . Ralnia beckened jamier to put
                      some pants on before standing in front of the great lady.</P>

                      Jamier only held her hand and began to sing:

                      <P>From far and near we come in this world. Within light and shadows we all
                      walk.<BR>
                      But the winds take us on many paths.<BR>
                      We are all special like the diamonds that everlast.<BR>
                      Many of us all of us reflect the colors of our days past.<BR>
                      Some of us scarred.<BR>
                      But no less special are we in this world…</P>

                      Jamiers song could never be finished in his own tears.

                      <P>Sorcere stood in amazement,” M’lady this young man has something I have
                      never seen.” Sugan turned her tears and attention to her Sorcere.
                      “He has the Heart of a Paladin”</P>
                      Sorceres words didn’t even faulter as he Bowed before Jamier.


                      <P>The Pain of Lanys”s Dagger peirces deeply into Jamiers side .. Yet Again
                      bringing him back to reality.
                      Jamier with all the tears and love in in his heart Struck harder at the Dark
                      demon. “NO! I wont let you have all that I stand for!” his vioce only stifeled in
                      the laughter and cheers of the Tier’Dal followers.</P>

                      Finally the fatal blow was stuck and jamier could feel his life force spilling
                      away. “Just call out the name of innoruk and he can save you” Lanys said with
                      a not of saddened yet mocking concern in her voice.

                      <P>Jamier remembered Sorcere and Ralnia ..”Yes he thought to himself I could
                      have been proud to carry their name.” Then his mind wondered to the face of
                      sugan. </P>

                      “I WILL STAND BY MY GODS! AND MAY THE 4 WINDS SAVE
                      YOU LANYS!” she maocked him as Jamiers life was finished. “poor
                      misguided soul”

                      <P>Jamier felt the darkness .. He was dead without even a chance to say good
                      bye. In a way he knew he failed. He began to prepare himself for his journy to
                      whatever hell a dark elf goes when suddenly he was bathed in the brightest
                      light . his soul was binded by its brilliance. “Your time is not up Yet Jamier!” as
                      he found himself fading and slipping back into his corpse.</P>

                      Without a wound upon his body he awoke at the feet if the She-Demon of
                      Innoruk.
                      <P>“I see the gods found you worthy! You fought with honor paladin!”

                      she reached her hands towards the sky
                      “My children! My father! I pray for his Soul!”</P>

                      Jamier clenched his fists tightly as he felt the scorning eyes watch him taunt him.
                      Jamier stood weakly to his feet to see a gleeming axe in his hand. It glowed
                      brilliantly with the power of blood and gods. It was the Axe of the fabled
                      Exectuioner….

                      <P>Jamier for the first time realized that his path was a march in the name of
                      blood.</P></DIV></TD>
