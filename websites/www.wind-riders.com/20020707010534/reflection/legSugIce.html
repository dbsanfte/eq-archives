                 <P>"...surrender not the sanctity of thy Father's name,<BR>
                 and turn aside the sword from the Blood of thy Brother."</P>

                 The words moved like feathers from Sugan's lips, lightly and easily, as she wrote them.
                 Sugan frowned at the page then, wondering what madness had taken her. She
                 crumpled the paper up and tossed it aside. Quickly and deliberately she took another
                 blank piece, wrote her message, and tacked it to the tavern's bulletin board. Thrice this
                 had happened to her in the last week, with this same phrase, while trying to write
                 something else.

                 <P>She recognized the passage of course. It was from the teachings of Karana, about the
                 mercy a knight should show on his fellow man, and the pride one should have in his
                 family name. Sugan in her youth however, always took it literally, to mean her father
                 and brother. She considered it written directly to her, from Karana himself... her old
                 mentor Stormangel often quoted it to Sugan when she was frustrated with one or
                 another of Faileas' actions.</P>

                 As it didn't seem important, she let the ghost writing event slip from her thoughts.
                 Sugan had much, much worse to worry about. She shivered in spite of the toasty fire
                 while reading over her message on the board:

                 <P>To Anyone Who Can Help,<BR>
                 An esteemed officer of my fellowship, The Wind Riders, has gone missing. Canelon
                 Lightweaver was last spotted during our war with the Shadow Striders, engaged in
                 combat with their leader, Lord Faileas Imshee'Cro. He was confirmed to have
                 survived this, but no information regarding his whereabouts can yet be found.<BR>
                 Cane is a male high elf, about 5'9", with blue eyes and white hair. He is a noble holy
                 knight and servant of Tunare, and was last seen wearing armor made of bronze and
                 carrying the famous sword- Ghoulbane. I know that doesn't help much... but please, if
                 you have information or can help in any way with his recovery to me I'll be more than
                 happy to give a reward.</P>
                 <P>Thank you and may Karana bless your journeys.</P>

                 Sugan Imshee'Cro<BR>
                 Knight of Storms<BR>
                 Wind Riders

                 <P>Sugan walked to the bar, casually grabbing her white polar bear cloak as she passed
                 her table. She didn't stop to think about her note; it had become procedure in the past
                 weeks. The bartender gave one look at her empty expression, and handed her another
                 glass of elven wine. Like he had been doing all evening. She wasn't a drinker and it
                 showed, but she could stand the fine spirits from Felwithe. It was the drink Cane often
                 bought her.</P>

                 Sugan shivered again in her leather town clothes and sat down. She wrapped the soft
                 cloak around her and looked deep into the glass of red liquid, wondering if Ralnia had
                 ever sat on that stool. Her thoughts formed a twisted path from this, lingering only
                 briefly on each one. All of them ignored the one issue tearing out her heart.

                 <P>Does Ralnia only drink out of sadness? Is she sad often? Did I have any other reason
                 to come to Halas than to write that note? Can't stand this cold.. </P>

                 She pulled the cloak closer around her, and then acknowledged it's existence
                 morbidly. It was the cloak Cane had given her.

                 <P>With almost insane intent, Sugan looked for other things she carried that were
                 somehow connected to him. The little doll that hung from her belt. It was a gnoll doll,
                 that had saved her sanity the time Faileas attempted to pull her into darkness. Kiki.
                 There was a necklace, beautifully crafted silver with blue gems. Her silver earrings.
                 Anything else? Sugan wondered with sarcasm. And then, her eyes caught the ring.</P>

                 Without regard to the strange glances, Sugan laughed aloud at the ring. It was a sad
                 sound, barely concealing tears. She picked up her glass and drained it just as quickly.
                 Money was thrown on the counter for the wine. It was expensive in this area, but she
                 could afford it. Sugan stumbled wordlessly out into the snow. Her thoughts moved as
                 slow as her boots in the drifts.

                 <P>She would have to tell her friends soon. Many of them had already questioned her
                 mood, but Sugan made up some excuse or another. But Canelon was really missing.
                 He often left on his grand quests, adventuring, returning with treasures... always taking
                 time to send her reassuring letters. Sugan had thought herself foolish at first when her
                 instincts told her something was wrong. Cane did not need her worries, she thought.
                 He was more able to care for himself than she was.</P>

                 Her brother wasn't much help at all. Usually forgoing any arguments at hand to help
                 her personally; Faileas seemed merely cool and aloof at her questions. He said he'd
                 last seen the elf in the grand tunnel between the commons of Freeport, and the Deserts
                 of Ro. During the war. He said they had fought. Faileas said Cane was too great a
                 match, and so he'd fled...

                 <P>Right off, Sugan felt that was wrong. Her brother had a hard time keeping secrets from
                 her. As much as it hurt, Sugan suspected Faileas was lying. But stupidly, she kept
                 searching. Praying to Karana that Cane would show up, in his perfection; sword and
                 armor and eyes looking like they'd never known a battle. Like he always did. Nay,
                 Faileas never lied to her.</P>

                 She imagined them fighting; a vision of gold and white contrasting red and black. She'd
                 seen Cane fight before. He fought like a demon, despite his gentle nature. Faileas was
                 precise in his style, studying even while reacting. Now that it had her attention, Sugan
                 realized they fought very similarly. The irony of this knowledge made her smile. Must
                 have been a beautiful thing to watch, from an outsider point of view, she thought
                 proudly.

                 <P>An icy crystal of a tear brought her pride a cold, sharp edge. She pulled out a bottle of
                 the wine from her backpack, eager to finish stopping the thoughts. Sugan hummed a
                 bright little tune as she lost herself in the rhythm of her footsteps to Qeynos. Halfway
                 there, she realized it was a melody Cane sung to her. </P>

                 Only the wolves could answer her screams.</DIV></TD>
