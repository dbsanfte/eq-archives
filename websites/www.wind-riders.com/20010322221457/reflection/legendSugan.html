                 <P>Sugan awoke with a start, troubled once again by those horrible, familiar dreams. She
                 blinked around at the eerie inside of the tower room, waiting for recognition to hit her.
                 A guard peeked around from the arched entrance.</P>
                 "Wake up, Lady Sugan." he said, "You're tossing again. And one of yours here needs
                 to speak to you."
                 <P>The Knight Sugan ran a hand through her tangled red mane once, put on her boots,
                 and stood up. She was welcomed by a comforting roll of thunder as she stepped out
                 onto the vast plains of Karana. Before her, a breathless man was chatting with a guard.</P>
                 "...yeah, that's what I said too. *pant* Don't know why any man in 'is right mind would
                 mess with the likes of them, evil or no..." the man stopped short at the appearance of
                 Sugan.
                 <P>"Hey, Sug! Good Day t'ye!" he smiled.</P>
                 Sugan breathed deeply of the rain-heavy breeze. "Raenewae, it's great to see you.
                 What's the matter?"
                 <P>"Nae's the matter M'Lady. Yet." he chuckled, "There's a visitor in Qeynos asking for
                 ye. From the looks of it, he's travelled from the distant Felwithe. Thought that granted
                 your immediate attention, if it's your will." Raenewae said.</P>
                 "I'll head there now. Need supplies anyway." Sugan said, turning inside, "You catch his
                 name?"
                 <P>Raenewae followed her in, casually picking up her things and putting them in bags.
                 "Aye, said his name was Canelon, or the like. Mighty regal-looking elf too; 'course,
                 most are," he grinned at his half-elven self.</P>
                 Sugan stopped, smiled and nodded, and walked outside.
                 <P>The ranger shook his head and, dropping the last of her sewing supplies in the
                 backback, joined her on the path.</P>
                 "Looks like Karana'll have 'is way with us today!" joked Raenewae at the dark clouds.
                 Sugan laughed brilliantly into the wind. "Aye, friend. Looks like it!"

                 <P>The two Wind Riders ran to Qeynos through the plains and hills, stopping only once to
                 rest at a travellers' tower there.</P>

                 Raenewae and Sugan entered the Qeynos city limits just as the storm passed. The
                 storm-shadows' edge crept over the gates of the town, leaving something glistening in
                 the sun like a white jewel. Sugan regarded it curiously, giving her friend a questioning
                 look. Raeneway just smiled back.
                 <P>As she neared the shiny mystery, it turned around and waved at her. "It" was a
                 smooth-featured high elf, adorned from head to toe in wonderfully silver armor. As he
                 beamed his royal smile, Sugan couldn't help but feel a little out of place with her
                 weathered and worn apparel. He didn't seem to take notice, however; and met her
                 with a grand bow.</P>
                 "My Fair Lady," the elf recited in an eloquent accent, "Canelon Lightweaver, Servant of Tunare, at
                 your disposal."
                 <P>Raenewae lifted his eyebrows. Sugan shifted and smiled at the ranger uncomfortably.
                 She turned to the elf's kneeling form, "Rise, Canelon. I am Sugan, Knight of Storms.
                 What can I do for you?" she asked politely.</P>
                 "I assume you received the letter from Felwithe. I have come, as I requested, to join
                 your noble cause. Oh, and please call me Cane." he said.
                 <P>Sugan squinted, searching her memory. "I recall no letter," she puzzled. "Perhaps it fell
                 to misfortune?"</P>
                 "Um, that's the other thing I wanted to tell ye." Raenewae intercepted, "One of our
                 Weavers ran across someone suspicious on 'is way to Freeport. Whatever it was
                 vanished to the shadows, but it's magical pet was nae so lucky. Was carrying the
                 remains of this letter Cane speaks of,"
                 <P>Raenewae drew his voice down to a whisper, "We think it was your brother's doings,
                 Sug..."</P>
                 The Knight of Storms' eyes flashed with unleashable anger at the mention of Faileas,
                 her corrupt twin. (to be continued)</DIV></TD>
