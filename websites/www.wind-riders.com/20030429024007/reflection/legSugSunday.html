It was a gloomy type of Sunday in the Wind Riders' guildhouse. The cold rain outside discouraged most of Freeport from heading outside to their normal businesses, so there was no reason to really. And it was rather warm and cozy inside, anyway. The main hall was decorated with pictures of those Wind Riders fallen in battle, cheerful pictures to celebrate memories and good times. There was a pleasant pitter-patter from the rain on the rooftops, and the smell of Annabella's famous pies wafted throughout. Movements could be heard in the kitchen as she fixed a great dinner, with Aeluminadria and Dervin's help. Every once in a while, Aelumi would step out of the kitchen to listen to Sugan.
<BR><BR>Sugan had her podium set up near one wall of the main hall as usual, and was reading some verses from her beloved book, as part of their Sunday church service. Serenade watched, trying to look extremely interested. The rest of the Wind Riders were lounging quietly in the room, some of them fighting desperately to keep from dozing off. Elendur in the front row lost such a battle, and his head drooped. Krannyar beside him decided he'd waken up Elendur one too many times with a poke to the ribs, and so let him be. Cerah, on the OTHER side of him, giggled quietly and shook her head. Sirynn in the corner was quietly tuning his mandolin by replaying pretty snippets of music... it didn't help to keep everyone alert. Even Sugan stopped reading once or twice to yawn, which was contagious. 
<BR><BR>Brenix and Teppeny sat on the floor in front of the podium, coloring. Kokiri sat with them and hummed along with Sirynn's tune while she braided Brenix' fur. Thryn stayed awake by wrinkling his nose in different ways and making other WEIRD faces. Raedjin, who was leaning against the wall, nearly shoved his entire fist in his mouth to keep from laughing. Septus sat off to Sugan's right, his eyes fixated on the necklace she wore wrapped around her wrist. Beside him, his brother Trittus folded animal shapes out of a sheet of parchment.
<BR><BR>Malladin and Laneni stood near the doorway. While Malladin was paying rapt attention, Laneni seemed more in meditation, reflecting on her conflicts within. Reinn was solemn too, trying to act like Malladin. Robbi glanced up and nodded at Sugan's words once in a while, her attention on the locket she held with someone's picture in it. Grabthar, with a mock annoyed face, pushed Nilenya off of him each time she dozed off. Kainos polished his armor. Raenewae entered, fashionably late, and nodded quietly around the room before taking a seat. It was home.
<BR><BR>"…and as the Rainkeeper tends the fields, " Sugan read, "so too should we strive to tend all good souls. We devote our lives to protecting those who cannot protect themselves. We devote our lives to guarding travellers. We devote our lives to Teppie…"
<BR><BR>Right then, Teppeny looked up sharply, but no one else seemed to notice. Sugan kept on reading as if nothing had happened.
<BR><BR>"…goodness and prosperity upon all lands, as we go forth to defeat Evil Was Here."
<BR><BR>At that last bit, Sug paused and frowned at her book. The young halfling Teppeny, suddenly realizing something, stood up and tried to sneak into the kitchen. Krannyar looked up questioningly at Sugan, who turned a few pages and then flipped through them quickly.
<BR><IMG SRC="../images/defSugTep.JPG" WIDTH="471" HEIGHT="400"><BR>"Who did these doodles? Someone wrote in my book!" Sugan said. Suddenly stopping on a page full of her doodle-covered spells, Sugan put her finger on it and yelled, "Teppieeee!!!"
<BR><BR>At the sudden change in tone, Elendur leaped up from his chair and yelled, "Praise the Light!"
<BR><BR>Everyone looked at him, bewildered. Then they started laughing. Cerah and Raedjin fell down on the floor. Sugan spotted Teppeny sneaking off, who winced visably and squeeked.
<BR><BR>"You little…" Sug growled, chasing her. Teppie scampered off and up the stairs, Sugan close behind, with the sounds of struggle soon after. In the main hall Raedjin still hadn't stopped laughing, and Elendur stood there blushing bright red. He looked very solemn as he reached over and started tickling Cerah mercilessly. Even Malladin cracked a smile.
<BR><BR>Annabella walked out of the kitchen with a smirk. "Dinner's ready, you clowns." she announced. Sugan and Teppeny joined the rest of the hungry crowd with down feathers in their hair, and it honestly looked as if Sug lost the pillow fight.
<BR><BR>Dipping up a bowl of vegetable soop, Thryn said, "So Sugan, there's something I didn't understand about your sermon today… when you said we devote our lives to Teppie, did you mean literally or was that just Karana's metaphor?"
<BR><BR>"Ha ha." Sugan said blandly.
<BR><BR>Thryn grinned evilly. "I mean, God of Rain, God of Rogue Graffiti… sure covers a lot of bases. Don't know if I can keep up."</DIV></TD>
