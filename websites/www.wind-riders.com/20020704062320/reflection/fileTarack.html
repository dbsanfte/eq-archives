								Another uneventful day, as Tarack put his sword and shield against the wall, and sat down on his bed. All the tales he'd heard of excitement the Wind Riders had in Freeport, he was beginning to dismiss as pure myth. Either they'd happened when he wasn't on shift as a guard, or he'd been around Freeport on some kind of errand for one of the Riders. "See that the knights of truth get this message would you Tarack?" and "Tarack, if you have a moment could you go and pick up a few things from Hogcaller's?" were all the orders he would be given. Not that he begrudged helping the kind souls that had taken him in after being beaten and chased from Neriak. But he wanted more action.
	<BR><BR>For a year now, he'd been guarding the guildhall. "Not the adventuring type" he'd say, when deep down he longed to stand side by side with one of the legends, like Kainos, Latharos, Annabella, Phenix who knows, maybe even the Lady Sugan Imshee'Cro herself - and fight the war in the name of all that was good.
	<BR><BR>Instead, he took care of more modest tasks - like making sure the armory was kept in good order, and taking his shift as night guard outside the guildhall. He lived in the guildhall itself, and didn't mind doing his job. To him, he was simply a man defending his home.
	<BR><BR>Tarack's room was small, almost a cupboard. In fact, it might well have been used as one at some point, before Sugan had got ahold of the guildhall. There was room enough for a bed, and a small table. This suited him fine, since he didn't really have many posessions to store. In fact he could count those he did have on his fingers (all ten of them now, after nearly breaking Blaline's jaw to get his lost one back).
	<BR><BR><i>A Suit of armour</i> - The crafted type, Handed to him during his training and still as new-looking as the day it was made. When Tarack wasn't wearing it, it would lean in the corner of the small room and reflect the candlelight - brightening the darkest corners. It was pretty much the only real clothing he had, besides the thin cloth garments he'd wear underneath it. Chances were, if you saw Tarack at all, he'd be in his armour.
	<BR><BR><i>Sword</i> - A light, sharp blade. Named after Jar`Nal, probably its maker. No particular story behind how it was made, or where it came from. For this reason, Tarack had felt an affinity with it. He too, had no particular background, no markings to make him anything special in the multitude of other blades out there.
	<BR><BR><i>Shield</i> - One of the items Tarack protects most (not realising the irony of protecting a shield...) a Sheet of lightweight steel, with a Teir`Dal ribcage on the front of it. His pride clearly reflected whenever he wears it, as a traitor of the dark elves.
	<BR><BR><i>Bow</i> - Nothing special here, a strong branch he found out in the commonlands and whittled down (which is hard enough to do with the proper tools, let alone a great hulking longsword) and tied with some simple silk thread. It serves it's purpose though, despite the lack of accuracy on the Elf's part.
	<BR><BR>...And the last of his possessions - a scroll, written in elvish he would keep on the table by his bed. The words written on it remained the same every day, yet each night he'd read over them again and again, as if each night they took on a new meaning. And they did, in a manner of speaking.
	<BR><BR>This scroll was his most valuable possession, which if you'd ever seen Tarack's room before he got it you would understand. The table used to store all his things, the sword, bow, and shield atop it, and his armour piled beneath.
	<BR><BR>Those things were scattered around the room in a haphazard manner now, still tidy but no longer in so much of an ordered pile. The table now held nothing but the scroll itself, and a small wooden stool in front of it.
	<BR><BR>Keep thing simple, and you'll live a happy life...
	<BR><BR>...so what was this nagging dull pain that would pull at Tarack's heart every now and then?<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> Ah, Tarack. I don't know much of his past, but he's a good man who does his job well. Most helpful fellow, especially on those days when I'm supposed to pick up flour for Anna but something happens... you know?<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> Of course I have no idea who this is. Does the Wind Riders' guildhall seem like somewhere I'd drop by for crumpets and tea?<BR><BR>
