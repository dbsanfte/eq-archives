								<B>History:</B> Willam was born to a Feir'Dal family of great renown, his father was Elric Darkbow a mighty warrior. HIs mother, Diane Darkbow, a druid of amazing power.
								<BR><BR>Willam's father lead many raids against the hell hole of Crushbone. During one of these battles, Elric wounded the emperor Crush. The orc lord a understandably maddened by this and sent Lord Darish to assassinate Elric and his family.
								<BR><BR>Darish attacked Kelethin with a small force of orcs, they attacked one of the lifts to draw Elric out. He came and was stabbed in the back by Darish. Darish snuck into Kelethin, avoiding the patrolling guards. He found Diane waiting for her husband impateintly by the door. When she saw him she gripped Willam in her arms and attepmted to flee. But Darish crushed her throat, to let her suffocate upon her own blood. 
								<BR><BR>Darish took Willam, he was bringing him back to Crushbone as a prize to his master, but he was stopped by an arrow into his arm. He turned to see Meysen Trueshot standing with his bow drawn and eyes blazing. "Put the child down," Meysen said.
								<BR><BR>Darish said that he would only if Meysen let him go. Meysen did so and being an honorable ranger, he did not kill the orc. He took Willam and raised him as his own.
								<BR><BR>Meysen raised Willam as his own. Willam became a ranger and had many adventures with his two friends, Elari Silverain the elven wizard, and Aludra Mindblast the elven enchanter. And Willam fell in love with Aludra.
								<BR><BR>But alas, before Willam could proclaim his love, Elari stole Aludra away from him. Willam was crushed, his love had been taken by his best friend. Willam left then, to go on his own journy, to find himself.
								<BR><BR>He reappeared a year later with a new friend, a man named Kilbann Beowulf. Kilbann was a fellow ranger and they both had a vendetta against the orcs of Crushbone orcs, Kilbann's wife and child had been killed in an orc raid of his home.
								<BR><BR>Willam and Kilbann stormed the castle of Crushbone with the help of a young Koada'Dal wizardress named Correlle.
								<BR><BR>Willam killed Darish. He and Kilbann wounded Crush but the Emperor escaped.
								<BR><BR>Willam, Kilbann, and Correlle became friends. Willam and Correlle were wed in the Temple of Marr in Freeport.
								<BR><BR>Willam now lives under the stars, his wife Correlle wishes for him to settle down with her. But Will feels there is something missing, some...thing he must do, he dosen'y know what it is..but one day he knows he will find it.<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> *tries very hard to look somber* Willam actually made me dance. Any man who can convince me to dance, is a man I respect.<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> *copies Sugan's poker face* The ranger got Sugan to look like a fool. Any man who can convince Sugan to look like a fool, is a man who didn't have to try very hard.<BR><BR>
