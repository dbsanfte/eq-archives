		So many people, myself included, become caught up in the details of everyday life... so much so that they can't see the tension the world is holding. I see it now. Now that my honor's been taken and restored. My name abandoned and refound.
		My faith forsaken and rekindled. All that this Red Warrior "Marcaich" was perhaps, was a brief glimpse at the sorrow I rise above on a daily basis. Some loved who she was, others hated her. If I hadn't been there, I may very well have never understood her myself.<BR><BR>
		Marcaich wrote: <I>A name is a power that can bind and hold any creature. A name is a stigma that follows one beyond life like the soul's shadow. If the name I was born with traps me within its entropy... I'll just abandon it.</I><BR><BR>
		Yes, she was punished by Karana for blasphemy, as any Knight is who abandons their god. Yes, she made many bad choices on her own. No, she was not pessimistic, or a creature of lost hope. She had no where to go but up; and that was where her focus lay. The truth is, I am Marcaich, but purified in Karana's glory.
		I became Marcaich on the day of Lord Faileas' trial, I just didn't know it yet. I'll make no excuses. The depression I felt, my friends' betrayals, and the possibility that my brother was unsaveable was not enough to justify drowning myself in alcohol. I don't blame my brother for being disgusted.
		It was a shame unworthy of Karana's servant, or anyone for that matter. To those who would argue that I am to be followed and not the Rainkeeper who guides me, I answer: Humility is a Holy Knight's best quality... never ask one to give that up. The storm is the holder of what wisdom I seek, the undisputed purifier of the land. If we think ourselves any more grand, we're being delusional.
		Thank Gods the situation with Marcaich is over. How, you ask?<BR><BR>
		I had my Genesis Knight, Kainos, to keep an eye on the ferocity between Freeport's Militia and our North Freeport Temple allies. Several incidents on Bristlebane's Day obstructed my dealing with Syrene's surrender, of which the full outcome has yet to be learned. 
		I (Marcaich) vaguely remember coming to a little after midnight in Nektulos Forest, wearing a Shadow Strider's badge and black armor. Faileas and I straightened matters out quietly, though never discovered the cause...<BR><BR>
		That's when Kainos gave me his urgent report. The Militia was about to make their move. The Wind Riders would have been involved anyway, but with our guildhall stationed in North Freeport, the situation was dire. I rallied the Wind Riders for a grim task that had been requested by the Hall of Truth some time ago.
		Until that day, I believed that the fallen paladin Sir Lucan D'Lere could perhaps be forgiven. Though the rumors of his dealings with the Dismal Rage were true, I believe everyone has some good in them. But, we were left with little choice than to concede to the Hall's request, and assassinate the dread Lucan.
		Jereel seemed to thrive in the blunt retribution of the whole ordeal; I don't understand his mentality of craving that, but even I felt some grim satisfaction.<BR><BR>
		The battle itself was a terrible, grisly ordeal that I don't relish detailing... I have nightmares of the blind crawling, as my own blood obscured my vision, as a wounded Latharos guided me to D'Lere's body to retrieve his Testimony. However, open war between North and West Freeport was averted and the Wind Riders were hailed as heroes of the day. 
		Later we snuck into the depths of Splitpaw, where a captured Knight handed off his responsibility to me. A fiery sword that could trap evil souls- SoulFire. Could it be the tool I need to fight Faileas' soul magic? I felt Karana calling me to the surface then, and when I saw daylight again I felt reborn. My brother was there to witness it, I think he was even proud. I've since accepted my given name again, Sugan Imshee'Cro.<BR><BR>
		Marcaich saw and dealt with a good many things though, sides of adversaries that no one thought existed. Such was the case in Malgorm's Fading. That's all I can call it really; he appeared to me in North Karana, gave some kind of warning and a sad farewell. And Faded. I'm left with this jewel, (a sapphire or black sapphire- not sure) and his haunting words.<BR><BR>
		<I>Thunder rolled low on the horizon. "...who, Faileas?"<BR><BR> "You've forsaken him." Malgorm said, "Take him back, and take the rest of my life force. Take the rest of what is Malgorm Imshee'Cro."<BR><BR> Marcaich looked wary despite the rain's presence, as her old nemesis approached her. "Demon, I will only take your word so far. But for what it matters, thank you."<BR><BR>
		The demon looked more human than he ever had before, his red hair as tangled as Marcaich's, and dripping in thick locks. "Please, take that love I had for her, and never let it die."<BR><BR> "I understand." she nodded at him, "And I understand who you are, underneath. What you tried to do.. for her, and for yourself."<BR><BR> Malgorm embraced Marcaich and kissed her. A bright light glowed
		from inside, and the man Malgorm faded from the world. Jerhyn looked at the ground solemnly and Red's tears mixed the raindrops, forgotten.<BR><BR> She looked at the gem left in her palm and said, "There went a Legend."</I><BR><BR>
		Prince Darain Thex also showed a side of him no one thought existed.. and for a short time he and I were on the path to find Karana together. Unfortunately for him, the dark allure of evil seems too great. And Lady Nauria, who I asked to help me long before I needed it. (Malladin's parting gift to me was some kind of random clairvoyance.) I want to return the favor to her someday, though
		recent events are leading to animosity instead of understanding. Did she say there were Three left? I wonder who will be next...<BR><BR>
		The Red Warrior was an ally of the Demon Hunter Malgroth's for the sake of learning, though now I do not know where we will stand. He has something I want, something we have been commanded to destroy. He will not give it to us. That intuition I spoke of is telling me that we'll not be allies much longer, though I will try to calm things as much as I can for Lummine and Jereel's sake.
		My brother is planning something too.. he's none too happy about our dance with the Militia. If my sources are correct, a close friend of mine is in great danger from him. <BR><BR>So, as one can observe with all this taken into account, the tension between factions is almost tangible. For now, we will wait, Pray, and continue our vigilance.
