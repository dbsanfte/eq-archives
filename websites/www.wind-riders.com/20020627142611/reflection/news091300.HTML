								<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top" WIDTH="510"><DIV CLASS="main">From Sugan's Diary:
								<BR><BR>"…I don't know what to think, in the end of it all. So many things, coincidences perhaps, as I don't believe in Fate. The time is near though for Faileas. I know it's for myself in a way too. His trial is next Sunday, the 8th of the month. What if they don't believe me about his slavery to Bertoxxulous? I don't know if I can deal with Norrath without my brother, my twin, if they sentence him to death. His thoughts have always dwelled with me constantly. Not his exact words… He has much more control than that. I sometimes feel what Faileas feels, (which is so much more than what he says) and what he thinks he's doing for the best. I don't like all his thoughts though. His loyalty and emotions for some of those vile Shadow Striders… no, not at all.
								<BR><BR>Sometimes I wish Shannyn would've influenced him otherwise during her time in the Shadows. They have a lot of similarities. I really like Shannyn. Perhaps it's none of my business, but it seemed like Faileas and she… no, it's none of my business. Yes it is. Faileas is too damn fond of his dark elf apprentice. If I could destroy one person without another thought, it would be her. Talisson's getting close too. But I won't even go into that.
								<BR><BR>Faileas has this… spirit form, this Avatar he's using. The image appears as strong as he always has, dark armor and all, though it taxes him to use it. To find my brother deathly pale and unconscious on the floor of his cell is frightening. I've found a way to hinder and interrupt him, but not to prevent it. I do what I can to keep him from commanding anything of the Shadow Striders, but I do allow my brother some creative freedom. He is able to pursue his blacksmithing craft in Freeport, which I have great pride for. Constructive activity does him a lot of good. Heck, it does me good too. The armor and weapons he creates are beautiful. 
								<BR><BR>He's also used his Avatar to aid us in war against the lich, which we fight alongside Clan Krieger and Ancienne Noblesse. I don't know what his purpose is in doing that yet. Someone mentioned that he was simply looking out for me. I hope it's that innocent.
								<BR><BR>Dear Karana, I don't understand what you've been telling me. You've blessed me by taking Malgorm's nightmares away, but my dreams sometimes make me so sad."
								<BR><BR>The shadow knight Nauria and I have agreed on somewhat of a truce. I've never gotten along with a dark knight, nor anyone who practices Necromancy for that matter, for any amount of time. I'm not sure if what I've done is exactly the right thing, either. But it does feel right, in the face of greater adversities, to fight alongside others who simply want this world to keep existing. Or am I compromising my beliefs? I mean, this dark elf is undoubtedly the source of sins and pain. She's the Demon of Compromise. In the end, I know what my faith will command of me, towards her kind.
								<BR><BR>Lady Nauria sometimes makes me extremely anxious. For reasons other than the obvious though; she has a strange …kindness perhaps? It surrounds her sometimes, and I can't figure it out. She's gentle in that way Serenade can be. What is that?
								<BR><BR>When she gave me a wrapped gift, I must admit, I had a cleric divine upon it for me before I opened it… A pretty silver hairbrush. Koada'Dal in origin I think she said, because she brushed my hair with one similar to it. (Which surprisingly didn't hurt, knowing my tangles… perhaps it felt better than it should've.) Even trusting the cleric's words I hesitated to use it, for wariness of some enchantment. But I use it nearly everyday now though, and even carry it around with me despite the fact that I probably shouldn't. It seems too expensive to actually use.
								<BR><BR>Syrene has become a problem, a big one, that I can't comprehend. She seems selfish, over-confident, cruel, and hedonistic. Quite different from the person I came to respect within the first 5 minutes of meeting her. If this is what she really thinks she is, then everything I remember was just an illusion… I don't believe for a second that our stance against vampirism is the cause of her actions. If she's so devoted to her truth she needn't be looking for someone to blame! I've taken a vow against vampires and the sort, and it's not one I will rethink. Syrene has a way out! Can it be that having a way out is why she just doesn't? Is she simply striving to keep her life in conflict? I can't understand that.
								<BR><BR>Those poor children she kidnapped… if I did ever fear, it would be for their outlook on life. I can think of no worse injustice than that inflicted upon a child. Syrene seemed shocked that we would consider seeing her pay for that. For the sake of our truce with Ancienne Noblesse I put Syrene's punishment into Nauria's hands. I trust that she did, as I trust the word of a knight, but it may be that her punishment was a mockery. I've heard the rumors too, it seems most of that type have some sort of… kinship with pain. For their sake I pray it wasn't. Justice isn't so easily eluded, even if it's beyond our doing.
								<BR><BR>This delicate truce is questioned by many people, whom I don't blame. The first occasion it arose was at the Call to Arms of Sir Artix von'Krieger, whom I respect greatly for his valor and courage as a Holy Knight. He's had his demons in the past, but so has everyone. It's true that I once nearly fell to some malicious spell devised by a seemingly black-hearted Artix and his vile master. A couple of young adventurers helped turn that tide, though. My strength returned, we went on to purify the darkness from Artix himself.
								<BR><BR>Now though, it appears we celebrated too soon… noble Artix has become something I can barely think about. He rises from his very grave to fight this lich which threatens to destroy everything we know. In battle I follow his skeletal form without seeing it. Too many memories… too many paladin comrades, made undead by the Bloodsabers, that I had to slay in the murky depths under Qeynos. Men and women I grew up with, worked and played with. Their voices still ring in my ears, begging to be released.
								<BR><BR>Artix von'Krieger fights with passion I've not seen in many, and he's patient and kind with everyone he meets, no matter how clumsy or inexperienced. All of the young Wind Rider Knights look up to him as a legend… maybe they got that from me? I too hope to lead with his tenacity and brilliance, and respect him as I do my mentor Stormangel. (May he rest in peace.) His clan is the same, I can't remember all the names of those who've pointed me in the right direction during this crusade. 
								<BR><BR>Our first encounter with the lich's force in the Ocean of Tears went well enough, though I think few of us knew what was happening then. Speaking personally, the horror hadn't yet hit me. The battle at Castle Mistmoore wasn't just a victory, it was utter triumph. At the time, anyway. And then in the Temple of Droga; I truly believe it was meant to make us overconfident. Tresjoli… oh poor Tresjoli! My blood went as cold as Permafrost was, that day the lich's words came out of her mouth to threaten us… so many losses… so much blood. We've so underestimated this monster. And the few clues we receive seem to keep us paranoid of our own company.
								<BR><BR>I put my faith in Artix though. His wisdom has gotten us this far, which is farther than I have. Even some Shadow Striders have followed Artix into battle. This lich knows we're a danger to it."
								<BR><BR>The day the truce between the Wind Riders and Ancienne Noblesse began was one of many strange happenings. We had an agreement with Syrene before, to cure Arithorn of vampirism. (Increasingly common and bizarre accidents of this sort… Disturbs me greatly.) The barbarian was unstable but alive at the end, and we'll continue to watch him as he recovers. Something had happened to Yavie though, that had awakened that thing inside her too. She left with Syrene that day, without her guild title. Another story.
								<BR><BR>Anyway, part of Syrene's agreement was that a member of Ancienne Noblesse would stand as a jury member in my brother's trial. If not Nauria herself, then another of Syrene's choosing. I found it completely irrational for a Shadow Knight to stand and judge another for crimes they themselves accept and commit. But Nauria seems willing to accommodate the laws and standards by which Faileas will be judged, during her time as a Tribunal Jury member. So be it. 
								<BR><BR>As she is a jury member, she is treating all matters concerning my family without bias. From that and our sharing Artix' battlefield came the truce. Nauria's earned something akin to respect from me, and even went so far as to strive for a kind of neutrality in her life. And there are a few things we've talked about that I hold in highest esteem. Many of the Wind Riders don't like it at all. They're starting to realize that Nauria's group isn't one we can count on for a constant system of beliefs though, and we aren't sure what binds that motley group together. I've heard rumors that they themselves aren't sure. A mystical force? Perhaps, perhaps not. What I do know is that it's good for Nauria herself to loosen her ties with the Prince of Hate, even if it isn't by her own will.
								<BR><BR>My Wind Riders have questioned me in the past. They have every right to, and I'll never begrudge that right. I have to constantly cleanse myself of impurities, or I'd be unfit to lead anyone. Thankfully a lot of them support my brother as I do… like Thryn, despite the pain Faileas has caused him. He knows it's the Curse. I have lingering suspicions that some Shadow Striders do too. Shannyn did. I listen to my guilds' concerns even if there's little basis, or it questions someone I personally trust implicitly. Sometimes their suspicions are closer to the truth than mine, sometimes it's paranoia. Such a situation has arisen with my fiancé, Serenade.
								<BR><BR>Aeluminadria was the first one to tell me what had happened outside Highpass Hold. She theorized that Serenade had toyed with an artifact he knew little about, and was transformed into a creature like a Dragon. She was right. I remembered the strange question Serenade asked me days before, during one of our daydreamy chats. He asked if I would still love him, if he were turned into a dragon…
								<BR><BR>Did Serenade know what he was about to do, and do it on purpose? No, I believe him in that. Was fate controlling it? No, we control our fates. Was something else influencing him without his knowing? It's highly possible in my opinion, and high still that he's yet under such an influence. In fact it's not out of the question that this is secondarily my fault, by way of my stupid curse. I love him with all my heart, and I know he's doing all in his power to reverse what's been changed. By collecting pieces of an orb that will open the gates to Veeshan's Peak, Serenade hopes that the great dragons there will help him. I've never been one to trust the dragons, though.
								<BR><BR>What's terrible is that Serenade thinks I hate him, or that he's been outcast, when I expressed my doubt in the powers he's currently throwing his trust to. The Wind Riders were satisfied with my solution. They will go about the task of getting the last shard of that orb from Lord Saeyn of the Shadow Striders, and then we'd divine its true use before just handing it over. Serenade wrote something disturbing at the end of his last letter. He wrote: "May the gods forgive you Sugan."
								<BR><BR>May you forgive me, beloved Karana, for putting my faith in you instead of Veeshan. I know exactly where I stand. Still. It hurts a whole lot."
								<BR><BR>Jikito has less contact with me than I like, but I know he's in your favor, despite all odds. I've seen less of Jasperr too, but that could mean anything. Perhaps the future shifted and he no longer has the concerns he brought with him. Malladin's prophecies worry me in that respect. I can't consider an outcome as he's described to me. (Although his prediction that Faileas would have a noble Knight of Thunder's end did make me stand a little taller!) There is no all powerful fate, at best we're guided by the will of Gods. But I do wonder if I make the right decisions. Some people think I trust too much, like Olarv and Tuskk, and some think I trust too little… like Syrene. While I might perceive both tales, Olarv seems to be closer to the truth. I just can't not give someone an opportunity to seek their redemption, though.
								<BR><BR>Olarv may have been right about Avari and maybe Yavie, but I can't hold that against say… Septus. Or Arithorn, even though he's turned in the past. Or even Saeyn, who now seems to be blessed. There are so many who have good inside them screaming to be set free. I even have hope for Avari and Yavie too. If I get burned in the process, so be it. I accept it. You alone know the limits of the Storm's mercy. I just wish others didn't feel that sting, too.
								<BR><BR>Thryn was hurt by Faileas more than he's willing to admit, even after we went to the ends of Norrath to resurrect him. What an adventure that was. Bertoxxulous was too clever, the power he channeled into Faileas was something foreign to anything our lands had ever seen. Such a plague released into the mainland and ports of Antonica would have been devastating. It's sick to think, but I guess we can be thankful that Odus served as a natural quarantine. I regret the many casualties caused by our lack of knowledge. It makes our efforts in discovering Kunark's secrets all the more dire, since it took an Iksar Necromancer to help him at all. What the long term effects on Thryn will be… I guess we'll find out.
								<BR><BR>Rainy. Dear old Raenewae. I really hope you have your best watch on that wolf, because my dreams about him were none too bright. He's in some sort of trouble, something shadowy, but I don't know where I could even begin to help. Raene's not acting especially different, but I noticed something deep in his eyes. He tries to guard himself too well, but that escaped. I feel like he's asking me for something… Please Karana, I pray I don't let him down."
