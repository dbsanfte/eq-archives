								<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top" WIDTH="510"><DIV CLASS="main">Its a taboo term, but sometimes its necessary... Guild War.<BR><BR>
								When the inevitable time comes, I expect my Wind Riders to keep their heads. I expect orders to be carried out with absolute precision, and above all,
								I expect vengeance to be the last thing on anyone's thoughts. Hate has no place here, and I can't afford to waste time on Wind Riders who secretly harbor it. Our wars come hand in hand with a goal, and open killing sprees provoke only that in return.
								It is understood between the Wind Riders and Shadow Striders alike, that Vigilantes acting on their own behalf during war will be held accountable as soon as possible. 
								In many cases... becoming Lone Vigilantes, without either guild to call their own.<BR><BR>
								We've had many, many instances of battle... though a few will live on in the halls of time; whether from the great victory, or the sheer trauma.<BR><BR>

								The <B>War of Lost Innocence</B> was our first open confrontation with the Shadow Striders. It began shortly after my return to the WR, and directly after Lillaie and Clanaugh's wedding. 
								Darain Thex, acting under Lord Faileas' orders, "gifted" us with the head of our good dwarven friend Koramur. That grisly presentation soon became one of Prince Darain's trademarks. It was a brutal
								and bloody war that left its mark forever in how my and Faileas' guilds would relate to each other. Though both sides tried to capture the others' leader, the War of Lost Innocence ended in a stalemate 
								as neither of us could afford any more loss.<A NAME="disgrace"> </A><BR><BR>
								The <B>War of Disgrace</B> began small enough; over an unborn child who's life was in danger. Silverann and Stormangell Jr. were never tempered enough to keep anything small for long though. Cross them,
								Lord Faileas, his Imp apprentice, the Demon Malgorm, Wind Riders Sorcere and Ralnia... and you have hostilities overflowing. This War ended with a decided loss. We lost Sorcere to the SS and Ralnia to Death,
								Silverann was punished for his dishonor by Faileas, and the child was lost besides.<A NAME="ambition"> </A><BR><BR>
								The <B>War of Ambition</B> was one in which we took the initiative. By then, Malgorm and his Disciples of Darkness had risen to power. With the Shadow Striders and other evil alliances, the Army of Darkness had
								already taken its toll on Norrath's cities. I knew there was a way to stop the Demon, but my brother held the key stubbornly, despite the problems even he was having with Malgorm. It took a few casualties and one
								enormous dance of tactics, but both the relic I needed, and Faileas himself were siezed to the Wind Riders' favor. Lord Faileas was held for months afterward, as the unnecessary legal red tape for his Trial was dealt with.<A NAME="tomb"> </A><BR><BR>
								The <B>Battle of Mistmoore Tomb</B> first came as a challenge to us by the Demon and his Disciples of Darkness. It was a race between our two forces to recover an important book from the tomb of Malgorm Imshee'Cro,
								which was moved centuries ago into Castle Mistmoore. The Disciples were powerful opponents, and it took subversive measures to get there. While two teams of Wind Riders provided distraction, (a painful task) Annabella
								made it to the tomb in time to snatch the book and wave goodbye to Malgorm and his henchmen.<A NAME="lich"> </A><BR><BR>
								Sir Artix von'Krieger's <B>War of the Lich</B> is the combined effort of many factions against a Lich with destruction in mind, (as if the Demon wasn't bad enough.) Krieger, the Wind Riders, Shadow Striders, and Ancienne Noblesse
								made an unusual but powerful force to reckon with. So far we've had many battles, some perfect victories, others with devastating loss.. though our objectives have always been met. One battle in particular,
								the <B>Battle of the Werewolf General</B>, was particularly ferocious as our forces were divided into a Suicide team and Arena team. Thankfully Qeynos was saved; the bloody struggle ended with the Werewolf General's death.<A NAME="trial"> </A><BR><BR>
								The <B>Battle of Lord Faileas' Trial</B> was short, devastating, and one that I (personally) surrendered to in weak depression. Its taught me a lesson in the long run though. Law is not a substitute for Virtue. Never again will
								I trust my brother to the hands of Law, be it Freeport or Qeynos.<BR><BR>
								Our next War? With any luck we won't have one, but I'm not that naive. The goals for each war differ, so every Wind Rider must remain alert to what approaches on the horizon.<BR><BR><A HREF="MAILTO: kith@unseelie.com"><B>- Sugan Imshee'Cro</B></A><BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/divider01.GIF" WIDTH=155 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><A NAME="ooc"> </A></CENTER><BR>
								<B>Out of Character:</B> Guild Wars can be fun, but I know from experience... they can also cause a lot of trouble for everyone involved in them, and a <I>big</I> hassle to those of us who have to clean it up. I've often noticed even the most veteran roleplayer can become inflicted with "War Fever" and forget that the player behind another character has feelings.
								We expect everyone in the guilds to be mature about PvP (Player versus Player) situations.<BR><BR>
								Always remember, when I and Faileas call technical guildwar in the game, it does not mean we have declared War in character. Many times we use the PvP switch simply to allow certain effects to be available in our roleplay. PvP/Guildwar is an enhancement to the story, not
								a license to begin killing. Anyone can play on one of the Zek PvP servers, if killing is all one wants out of a War. <BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#990000">As with any policy, failure to abide by this can result in Demotion or being Disbanded from the guild.</FONT> Some things to remember:
								<OL><LI>Each war has goals. It is extremely doubtful that these goals will include killing every enemy you come across, and I'm not very understanding of "convenient" mistakes.
								<LI>The PvP switch is an enhancement to the story, not an officially declared war. A war is declared when I declare it. If you have questions about it in game, give me a tell.
								<LI>In any PvP situation, be mindful of what level your opponant is. Level should not become an issue in roleplay, but certain spells used for effect might kill someone on accident. This has happened in the past.
								<LI>Make extra efforts to help everyone feel important, regardless of their level. If that means running or occasionally losing to a "Green con", so be it. (Losing a battle does not mean you have failed to roleplay well; on the contrary. If you can lose gracefully, your character is considered more well-rounded.) This applies to anytime outside Guildwar, too.
								<LI>Guildwars in the past have had technical bugs associated with them. If you find yourself randomly disbanded from the guild during war, please notify an officer.
								<LI>No one can be invited to the guild during guildwar. The War must be paused to invite anyone, and that means Faileas and I must be in the same zone.</OL></DIV></TD>
