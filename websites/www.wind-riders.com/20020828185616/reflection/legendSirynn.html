				                <P>I had finally returned to my home city. Qeynos, a bustling city of trade and commerce,
								full of everything this lonely bard could want.  There was the local bed and breakfast, The
								Lions Mane Inn (which also had a tavern around the back which didn't hurt its popularity Im sure);
								The Hall of Sorcery where one and all could come to see, and possibly learn the powerful
								incantations of the wizard, mage, or enchanter; The House of Thunder where all my fellow
								worshipers of Karana would go (also a certain red headed paladin that went there gave me
								something to look forward to when I got back to town); and, last but not least on my fave
								places of qeynos, is my home away from home, The Wind Spirits Song.  The Wind Spirits Song
								was where I spent my days and most of my nights when I was just a little naive Half Elf looking
								to follow in his mothers footsteps.</P>
				
								<P>This was the first place I stopped upon my return. I checked in with my guildmaster Jushean
								Eversque. There was many things I could learn from him now that I had poured days upon days into
								my training since I saw him last. After I trained in my new skills and checked for my latest songs,
								I sat down in the Lions Mane Inn and went to the back to get a bottle of my favorite drink,
								good old fashioned mead. I normally shy away from short ale's and other plain beers, but there
								was something in the mixture of mead that just lured me in. As I sat down and enjoyed my mead I
								used my highly trained and fine tuned half elven ears to listen in on some of the stories the
								travelers of Norrath were speaking of.</P>
								
								<P>I heard stories of many people, alot of them were of my friends and fellow riders.  I heard a
								Dark Elf telling a tale of my once dear friend, and adopted nephew, Silverann who committed suicide
								after his strenuous ordeal with some sort of trials.  This new paladin that was allowed entry into
								our coveted Wind Rider guild, Jamier; a Dark Elf who looked out of place from the one sided view of
								the High Elf cleric telling the tale. Then there was the Barbarian from Halas who mentioned a
								message posted by a Human Paladin named <font color=#800080>Sugan</font> saying about a lost love.
								**when Sirynn heard this his eyes started to well up with tears he was usually in full control of
								his entire body, especially his face, but for some reason when it came to matters of the heart he
								always lost control**</P>
								
								<P>This was the last story I was in the mood to hear on this particular night. So I walked out
								the door, trying my damnedest not to fall over in my drunken stupor, and crawled up the steps on
								my hands and knees to my room. All the time singing a song I had written in my travels entitled
								"A Hymn of this Man". As I fell into the nights bed singing my song over and over again, I got
								to thinking about how my lovely leader was, and what she could possibly be going through right
								now (I wondered this cause no matter where I went in the city and its surroundings I could not
								find her anywhere).  I'm not sure whether it was the effects of my song, the mead, or the memories,
								but all of a sudden I broke out in tears. And from there I just cried myself to sleep...</P>
