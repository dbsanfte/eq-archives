								<B>History:</B> The ship rolled, pitching to starboard as a wave hit it broadside. She clung to the rail, huddling against the gunwale until the vessel settled back into its usual riding of the swells. The blonde elf sighed and fervently wished that her stomach would settle back as well.
<BR><BR>
Overhead a seagull rode the air currents and cried out companionably to the waves. She glanced up at it, following its path through the blue sky. For an instant, the sun shone from behind it, turning it a deep, shadowed black as it wheeled, circled...
<BR><BR>
<i>...wheeled, circled, on wings as wide as the clouds and blacker than the night. They landed on ungainly legs, hop-waddling as vultures do, to peck at the bodies then scream in frustration as they found the bodies rotted with plague and inedible.</i>
<BR><BR>
She pulled her knees to her chest, shivering on the deck, unable to cease the visions in her mind. A year at least had passed as she healed and trained in the temple, but still it felt recent, raw, abraded. The nightmares, although rare now, had never truly stopped. And each step upon the soil of the Greater Faydark cost her in sorrow.
<BR><BR>
The day so many months ago had dawned clear and bright. It had shown so much promise, a vow of beauty and blue skies. The birds gloried in the weather, filling the deep woods with birdsong. With happy calls of morning greetings, each villager climbed from their beds to start the Duchy of the Goldleaf’s day. Six of such duchies existed in this forest, the territories of old landed nobles who refused to give up their land in favor of living near the courts of Felwithe.
<BR><BR>
They remained steadfast without stint, paying homage and tribute to the crown in loyalty and goods. The court had all but forgotten their presence, considering them antiquated remnants of an age best left in the past. But the crown did not forget. In return for their loyalty, they sent patrols of knights in periodic sweeps, for both honor and protection. A timeworn trade, venerable but suited to each. The children had loved to see the knights in their armor, swords gleaming in the sun, horses stepping proudly with ringing steel shoes.
<BR><BR>
A simple life, filled with simple things. Everyone pitched in to the daily chores of village life. Even the nobles did not rest on their laurels. The duke tilled the fields and split the firewood, and his daughter assisted the healers, gathering herbs and plants for both potions and supper. The old healer, a frail Koada’dal who had seen more turns of the seasons than any elf, had been mother and mentor to the girl since her own mother had died.
<BR><BR>
The salt spray on her face did not come only from the ocean. She scrubbed it away, willing herself back to the present, but to no avail.
<BR><BR>
As she had each morning, she went deep into the forest. The birdsong was beautiful, the air was cool and smelled of wood and green growing things. Dragonflies dipped and played over the small creek nearby, glimmering like jewels over the water. She gathered herbs and mushrooms in her basket, stopping to take off her sandals and walk through a patch of cool moss. She gloried in the feeling of the living velvet on her skin.
<BR><BR>
Time holds a different quality deep in the forest. It is more leisurely, and with no sun to dictate hours seem barely minutes. She did not realize how much time had passed until her instincts set to tingling, warning her that something was badly wrong. She listened, but could hear nothing. And that was the problem.
<BR><BR>
No birds. No dragonflies. A cricket cried, once, and she shivered despite the warmth. Forgetting her slippers on an overgrown log, she ran towards home. Branches reached towards her as they never had before, slowing her progress, and the ground never stayed where she saw it, causing her to stumble. Finally, panting, she stopped.
<BR><BR>
And the silence was broken. A female voice, gentle but overwhelming in intensity, filled her mind with urgency and love. For an instant, her life was light, sunshine on leaves, the heat of the desert, glistening on snow, and her being was consumed. “Hide, my child. Hide in the bushes, stay low, stay quiet.” She flattened herself in the undergrowth.
<BR><BR>
“To your right,” said the trees, and she turned her head. A figure, not a beast or a tree, but an upright form. A man. He gestured, and spoke a single sentence. “Bertoxxulous comes for us all.” Her eyes followed his gesture, and she could barely keep from screaming.
<BR><BR>
Home. Before them lay her home.
<BR><BR>
In the field nearest the woods worked a farmer. In an instant, the hands on the spade went from healthy to horrid, covered in disease and rot. Boils and pustules sprung up on his flesh, and it seemed to wither and gnarl before her eyes. He began screaming, tearing at his hands in a seeming attempt to chafe the meat from his bones. The pestilence ran up his arms, past his wrists and elbows, and into his simple farmer’s jerkin. It spiraled up his neck and covered his face.
<BR><BR>
Hearing his cries, his wife ran out of the house. The pestilence began at her fingertips and moved on. The miller came to see what the matter might be. The tailor peeked his head out his window. The epidemic spread like wildfire as she lay in the bushes, hands over her mouth to hold back her terror and revulsion as the entire village cried out in pain.
<BR><BR>
Even after a dead silence had smothered the forest once more she lay in the bushes. Her eyes burned with tears that would not stop, and her limbs felt lifeless and weak. The sun kissed the western horizon when she crawled out, staring into the collection of buildings that only half a day earlier she had waved so brightly to.
<BR><BR>
Shadows filtered into the branches, landing from overhead where the vultures wheeled, circled, on wings as wide as the clouds and blacker than the night. They landed on ungainly legs, hop-waddling as vultures do, to peck at the bodies then scream in frustration as they found the bodies rotted with plague and inedible.
<BR><BR>
Collapsing on the ground, she curled into a ball. Her sobs broke the forest’s silence as they broke her heart. In the center of the village, at the very heart of the mortification, lay a form that she knew better than any other. Beside that, a head of wispy white hair. Father. Healer. Both dead with mouths open in screams that would never leave their throats.
<BR><BR>
At a time that may have been hours, days or centuries later in her mind, hoofbeats overrode her weeping. A clatter of armor, then strong arms lifted her from the ground, cradling her against a gleaming breastplate. Orders were given in hushed tones, in words that should have been familiar but made no sense anymore. Drained, bent nearly to breaking, she passed into unconsciousness.
<BR><BR>
The Temple of Tunare. Hymns filled the halls as the priestesses cared for her, bathing her and feeding her in her wit-wandering. A week of this saw her return to herself, saddened and weak but determined. They worried for her, of course. Her hearing had not been damaged, and the hushed conversations that ceased when she came near did not stop quickly enough. Some feared she was infected herself. Others simply thought her mad.
<BR><BR>
It mattered little to her. Tunare had touched her, chosen her as an instrument in her fight against the Plaguebringer. Thanking those who had been so kind, she left the temple’s grounds, seeking shelter in the Steamfont with the gnomes, or in Butcherblock with the dwarves.
<BR><BR>
He was out there. Somewhere. People must be warned. He must be searched out.
<BR><BR>
“Miss, are ye a’right?”
<BR><BR>
The young sailor shook her shoulder, tanned face knitted with concern. She blinked and looked around, wiping the moisture from her cheeks. “Aye, I thank thee. Homesick, is all, and seasick too, for ne’er have I traveled upon the tides.”
<BR><BR>
He nodded and gave her a smile before returning to his station. Carefully, she made her way to the bow, staring at the city peeking over the horizon.
