								<B>History:</B> (OOC This is the story of how Siynn came into Norrath. His parents {Siren, a lovely and dainty
				wood elf bard; and a somewhat frail, but extremely charming human enchanter named Ledynn}  met in Crushbone, fell in love during
				their upcoming journeys, and had their first kid after their marriage.)
				
				<BR><BR>Siren was trying to save the slaves that were captured by the loathsome orcs, because she
				was a bard always looking to help.  The only bad thing was Crushbone was located near the high
				elven city of Felwithe and the high elves are a very snobby, and tight nit race.  So she had to go
				it alone. She was running along killing Orc Centurions left and right.

				<BR><BR>However after she entered the
				great Orc castle she heard a deep growl shout, "You bards are a disgrace to these sacred
				grounds."

				<BR><BR>It was the Crushbone emperor himself, and on both sides he was flanked on each side
				by his Royal Guard, and behind him was his personal Oracle.  She quickly noticed the immediate
				danger of her situation (seeing as she has some brains and is not as dumb as the Ogre warriors
				corpse that lay behind the emperor) so she quickly  spins on her heels and begins to sing Selo's
				Accelerendo (a song to increase the speed of her feet). Unfortunately she is quickly stopped dead
				in her tracks by a root spell complimentary of the Emperors Oracle.  So all she could do, as she
				was getting pounded and pierced by the fists and spears of the orcs, was yell for help. Luckily
				this yell for help was heard by a group of adventurers, just checking out their new surroundings, who
				were just outside the Orc castle. The group of adventurers ran as quick as they could to the aid
				of a lovely little wood elf with the angelic voice.

				<BR><BR>The leader quickly and decisively shouted out
				commands to the rest of his group, he wasn't the biggest or strongest one, but the group still
				listened to his orders (our lovely bard learned soon learned from the groups responses that the
				leaders name was Ledynn). Ledynn figured the first thing to do was to keep the lovely lady alive,
				so he had the cleric in the group cast some healing spells on her. The leader then charmed on of
				the Orc guards to fight along side them as his pet. Then they went to work on the orcs in the
				order of importance, the oracle, then emperor, then the guards.  The oracle was first because he
				was capable fo doing the most dmg, so they had the whole group concentrate in him first.  With
				the combined might of Ledynn and his four friends they made short work of him.  By now the
				elven bard had regained her senses, and told the leader that she would help with the battle
				because	she started it, and Ledynn quickly accepted her offer.  So they split up evenly a tank and a
				caster each on the Emp and Royal guard who wasn't charmed, Siren helped out with her Anthem de
				Arms song (which increased the speed and strength of their arms), and her Hymn of Restoration
				(which took care fo the minor wounds of the group). With the oracle out, the rest were child's
				play for the strong and well doverse group of six.

				<BR><BR>After the fight, everyone got together and got
				acquainted. Siren quickly took to the charming words and personality of Ledynn. Ledynn also was
				astonished by the beauty of her face and voice.  They quickly became a strong and well
				acquainted duo. When it came time for Ledynn to leave Siren's home, she said that she was
				coming with, and Ledynn couldn't deny that she would be welcome company on the long and
				lonely journey.

				<BR><BR>As they journeyed together they got really close, and they soon decided to get
				married. So they did. After the honeymoon little Siren wasn't so little, her stomach quickly grew
				and they assessed that they were soon to be parents. The birth happened on the last day in April,
				it was storming out, the earth was shaking with the sounds of thunder and illuminated by the strikes
				of lightning.  On that day a lovely Half Elven baby boy was born, who sang out a beautiful and
				powerful scream as he was birthed.  The scream shattered the windows of Siren and Ledynn's
				home, for this reason they knew Karana had blessed them with a baby bard.  Since he was gonna
				be a bard he was given the first half of his mothers name and the last half of his fathers name,
				therefore he was donned the name of Sirynn.<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> Sirynn!! He's my best friend, and I've known him since before I can remember knowing me! *giggles*<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> Spare me... Well, ok. I can respect anyone with enough patience to tolerate Sugan for as long as he has.<BR><BR>
