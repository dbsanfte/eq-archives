								<OL TYPE="1">
									<LI><A NAME="whatwr"><B>What is Wind Riders?</B></A>
									<BR>The Wind Riders is a good-aligned roleplaying guild on the Tunare Server, for the Online RPG <A HREF="HTTP://www.everquest.com" TARGET="linkWindow">EverQuest</A>. The Wind Riders are often referred to as "WR". Sugan is the guildleader.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="whatserver"><B>What server does the guild exist on?</B></A>
									<BR>Tunare, and only Tunare.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="howjoin"><B>How do I join the Wind Riders?</B></A>
									<BR>You must fill out our application for each and every character that joins. Keep in mind we are role playing guild, and your acceptance is dependant on your ability to roleplay your character well. Fill out that "History Section" in character, or as a story about your character. All out of character comments belong in the "Additional Comments" section.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="havetorp"><B>Do I have to roleplay to join the Wind Riders?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>Yes. It is the founding principle of our guilds. It is appropriate to keep out of character comments labeled in Guild Chat; one means is placing "ooc" in front of them. We play for the sake of our story, not for the power of level. <I>Never use your character's Level as a means to dominate a Roleplay situation.</I><BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="rprestrict"><B>Does "anything go" during roleplay?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>No. Although most of our roleplay is unplanned, there are certain events we don't encourage. EverQuest is a PG-13 game, and our guilds follow that guideline. Storylines of an explicitely sexual or questionable nature are to be kept private, or not happen at all. We don't allow rape stories, since too many problems arise from them.<BR>
									The key rule when determining a proper storyline is Permission by those involved. Some people will not want certain things to happen to their characters, like death. Ask before starting down that path.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="whatss"><B>Who are the Shadow Striders?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>The Shadow Striders is the sister guild to the Wind Riders. Both were created with the other in mind. They play the role of our enemies. Most Shadow Striders are out of character friends, so any hostility is to be kept in character! The Shadow Striders are often referred to as "SS". Faileas and Envy lead the SS.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="whofaileas"><B>Who is Faileas?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>Faileas is the leader of the Shadow Striders as they exist today. He is a human shadow knight, cursed by bloodline to follow Bertoxxulous. <BR>(Faileas' email is <A HREF="MAILTO: shadow@unseelie.com">shadow@unseelie.com</A>)<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="whosugan"><B>Who is Sugan?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>Sugan is Faileas' twin sister. She has managed to escape the rule of Bertoxxulous, and has become a paladin of Karana. She is the leader of the Wind Riders. <BR>(Sugan's email is <A HREF="MAILTO: kith@unseelie.com">kith@unseelie.com</A>)<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="whoenvy"><B>Who is Envy?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>Envy was once Faileas' Teir'Dal apprentice, now his partner. At one time she challenged Faileas' power, and lost in an honorable duel. She had been by his side ever since, waiting for the time when she may defeat him in honorable combat.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="whatcurse"><B>What is the curse?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>Faileas and Sugan belong to the Imshee'Cro family. History claims that an ancestor of theirs sold his soul to Bertoxxulous for the resurrection of his lover. The family bloodline has been cursed to follow the Plaguebringer ever since, most becoming necromancers of great power. This is the curse of Imshee'Cro.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="whatrole"><B>What is my character(s) role in the story?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>That is partially up to you. You create your character, you play that character. We ask that you stay away from being part of the Imshee'Cro family because then it dilutes the story. We like variety. If you present us with an interesting character, and the opportunity arises, your role could become very large. So the answer is twofold, play your character well and give us a little freedom to "GM" the story. Also, if you have any great ideas about future events/subplots, tell us. We will consider all possibilities.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="convertchar"><B>Can I convert a character of mine from another RPG I've played?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>Yes, but truly only in name and mannerisms. EverQuest is a different world, with its own lore and history. (i.e. do not confuse EverQuest's "Teir'Dal" with D&D's "Drow")<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="multchar"><B>What about multiple characters?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>You are permitted to have as many characters as you like in the Wind Riders <I>and</I> the Shadow Striders. All characters will be judged individually in every respect; ie: You may not be "married" to two characters belonging to the same player. (Unless of course, polygamy is an evilly roleplayed trait) Rules for joining alt characters can be found in the Members section. Alternately, you may have characters in other guilds.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="aboutpvp"><B>What about PvP/PKing?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>PvP is kept to duels, Guild Wars, and some arena events. We're not on one of the PK servers because we prefer to keep it in a controlled RP-friendly environment. Duels are to be honorable, with no outside involvement, and the combatants near equal level. 
									Arena events happen very rarely. Arena areas do not give any member of our guild free PKing rights. And of course, regardless of how the technical rules change/have changed, no one is permitted to loot fallen opponents corpses.<BR>
									Exceptions: If, for story reasons, characters agree to participate in an "unfair duel" it is admissable.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="aboutwar"><B>Guild Wars?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>Guild Wars are not a free licence to PK mindlessly into a bloodbath. The Guild Wars usually have rules, with set in character goals. Read this <A HREF="enemyGuildwar.html" TARGET="_self">article on Guild Wars</A> for more details.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="communicate"><B>How can I communicate with the rest of the guild outside of EQ?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>The WR and SS have <A HREF="../mbIndex.html" TARGET="_self">Message Boards</A> for a variety of topics. (Click on the pushpin icon in the black navigation panel to visit it, or paste this URL to your browser's address bar - http://pub15.ezboard.com/bwindriders) There is a Guide to Message Boards there that will explain how things work. The two guildhall forums represent our Headquarters themselves, and are assumed to be highly guarded in character (not quite invincible).<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="ridml"><B>Why did you get rid of the Mailing List?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>We've decided to use the <A HREF="../mbIndex.html" TARGET="_self">Message Boards</A> as our primary method of communicating outside the game. It's easier to control what you post on the boards, and you can edit and delete posts after creating them. Again, it's requested that ooc comments are labeled.<BR><BR>
									<LI><A NAME="whoprob"><B>Who do I go to with problems?</B></A> | <A HREF="#topfaq">Top</A>
									<BR>Any of the Wind Riders' officers can handle most in character and out of character problems. If none are around and your problem is ooc, look for Shadow Strider officers. If its a very personal or important matter, contact <A HREF="MAILTO:kith@unseelie.com">Sugan</A> or <A HREF="MAILTO:shadow@unseelie.com">Faileas</A> in game or through email. Remember, its very important to have information ready if you have a problem with another player. Faileas and Sugan are willing to help, but can do little when there are many different sides to a story, and no proof.
									Please read the harassment guide for some hints that help in any general situation involving other players.<BR>
