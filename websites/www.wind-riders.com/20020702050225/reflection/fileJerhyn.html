								<B>History:</B> Jerhyn used to be a happy child, content to run and play with the children
					of the Jaggedpine Treefolk, without a care in the world. For his ninth
					birthday he was given a shield made for him by his father, Jarec. He showed
					it off dragging it all around the forest and even took it with him when he
					went play hunting. On one such hunt, he was separated from the rest of his
					friends. He found a dark cave, which he mistook for the path to Qeynos.
					Jerhyn had never seen the other side of the hills as he wasn’t allowed
					outside the safety of the glade, and so he assumed he must have walked
					around to the other side by accident. Being a half-elf, his vision was
					hindered little by the darkness, and he ventured inside. This was different
					though, not like the darkness brought about by nightfall, or the shadow of a
					tall tree, or any that he’d ever seen before. This was more silent… more…
					still.
					<BR><BR>
					Jerhyn’s curiosity got the better of him as he ventured further inside, now
					only able to find his way around by touch, and not leaving a way for him to
					find his way out again. He turned to look back at the light coming from
					outside into the cave, but there was none. It was as if he’d been smothered
					by the darkness and was choking on it. He stumbled further forward, moving
					away from the cave wall he was using as a guide and fumbling blindly for the
					next footstep. His foot moved forward, and down towards the ground where
					there was none, he yelled as he fell down the steep path and landed on the
					cold, hard dusty ground below him.
					<BR><BR>
					When he stirred, one thought took over his mind, that of the sharp, shooting
					pain in his leg. It was broken, and he couldn’t stand. He squinted into the
					darkness and saw a small pinhole of light to his left. Jerhyn knew what
					would happen if he stayed in this dark cave; he had enough trouble seeing
					his hand in front of his face let alone someone else finding him. He pulled
					himself to his feet gathering all the strength he could find, Jerhyn lifted
					his body with his arms, and reached out to a broken stalagmite to pull
					himself up, his hand brushing past his shield lying next to it. If he didn’t
					have that shield when he fell, he thought, that spear of rock would most
					likely have impaled him. He picked up the shield and used it as a crutch to
					limp and hop his way towards the small light he could see in the distance.
					<BR><BR>
					Aerinon found Jerhyn a day later under a tree in the Unkempt Woods... He was
					barely alive and unconscious… Without memory of where he was from, or who he
					truly was, he came to live in Qeynos and was looked after by the kind souls
					in the Temple of life. After a while he could remember his name, but only
					from a letter he found in his pocket from his sister wishing him a happy
					ninth birthday (she had travelled to Felwithe to train in the arcane
					sciences). When he first read it, the name meant nothing to him, but as the
					years drew on he began to remember trees and animals and moments from his
					childhood, though nothing that gave him a clue as to his true heritage.
					<BR><BR>
					Jarec and Fayella Darkrain had not given up hope since the day their son had
					disappeared. Even though almost three winters had passed, Jarec still took a
					band of rangers out into the forest every day; he would even search by
					himself on the many nights he couldn’t sleep. Fayella wanted to join Jarec
					on his search, but he would not allow it. She felt so helpless and over
					time, desperate. She began to fear the worst for her son, and without her
					husband’s knowledge made contact with someone who would be able to tell her
					if her son lived. A dark-elf necromancer…
					<BR><BR>
					Jerhyn tossed and turned in his sleep… his release came in a nightmare… He
					dreamt that he was on a long journey; he walked from the gates of Qeynos
					down a long path, and out on to wide-open plains. There were lots of people
					there, some he recognised with a distant familiarity, other’s faces were
					warped in pain, hardly recognisable… Then he saw a knight behind the crowd.
					Standing proud in black plate armour with red boots and gloves, the knight
					seemed to be in control of this horde of mindless bodies. He awoke suddenly
					and sought out master Aerinon to explain his dream. Aerinon recognised the
					place in Jerhyn’s dream as the Plains of Karana and offered to take him
					there, so that his mind could try to work itself out.
					<BR><BR>
					It took a few days to cross the hills outside the city. Jerhyn had never
					been to this place yet he seemed to know it, every tree; every rock was
					exactly as he saw it in his dream. They came to the end of the shallow
					canyon to see the plains spread out before them. Jerhyn began walking out
					into the open fields; he knew where he was going. Aerinon followed at a
					distance, not wanting to disturb Jerhyn but at the same time not letting him
					out of his sight.
					<BR><BR>
					They came to a pile of ruins surrounded by corpses and there was the knight
					from the dream, sitting cross-legged at one of the ruined pillars. Aerinon
					immediately felt his strength fade from his body as he fell to his knees,
					reaching slowly for his blade and looking up in time to see one of the
					cadavers rise and lash out toward him.
					<BR><BR>
					Jerhyn heard a muffled scream from behind him, but was transfixed by the
					knight, frozen at the sight of his own nightmare come to life. The Shadowed
					knight smiled, and raised his arm signalling a pair of bodies that jerked
					into life and stood upright. Jerhyn swallowed to fight back the tears as he
					immediately recognised his parents standing with cold, blank, pale stares on
					their faces.
					<BR><BR>
					“I told them you had been killed…” the dark-elf started, with a wry smile
					“They followed me out here like helpless lambs, and it’s all your fault”…
					<BR><BR>
					“Your father has some very powerful enemies who want him dead… His entire
					family actually, and you have the honour of being the last of your line…What
					a comforting last thought, hmm?”
					<BR><BR>
					Jerhyn charged, sword in hand, shield raised, screaming the protective
					prayers he had learned from the paladins, ready to strike. The dark elf had
					expected Jerhyn to still be in shock and wasn’t prepared when he swung his
					blade at her, barely managing to disappear before the blade struck her neck.
					A few small drops of blood appeared to fall out of thin air where she stood,
					as her angry snarling voice echoed in Jerhyn’s mind… “Don’t think this frees
					you little one, it just gives you time to prepare for the inevitable!”
					<BR><BR>
					Fayella and Jarec fell to the ground in a lifeless heap their eyes finally
					closed and their souls released from the dark slavery.<BR><BR>
					Jerhyn buried his parents on a small hill, off the path in Karana and said
					his goodbyes… He blamed himself for losing his memory of them and allowing
					this to happen… When he returned to the temple of life, he was met with an
					icy reception. Few of the paladins there would speak to him, and most blamed
					him for the death of Aerinon. He packed up his things and left the temple,
					making his way on foot toward the east.<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> Jerhyn's of the quieter sort, but he does mean well. I'm sure the man has a lot to think about. I'm sure I've only witnessed a sample of his troubles, and they were enough.<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> It always baffles me, why those with enemies to begin with try to put themselves in positions of greater noteriety. In any case from what I've heard, he won't last long as a Wind Rider.<BR><BR>
