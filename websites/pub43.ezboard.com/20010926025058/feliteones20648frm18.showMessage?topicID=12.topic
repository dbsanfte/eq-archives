named Normon Stonetooth. You can reach him by going into the<br>
mines invis, taking first right, going down a ladder, then hopping over<br>
three sections of rail, then entering a large room, taking a left, then a<br>
right. He's behind a large chunk of crystals. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Normon Stonetooth' <br>
Normon Stonetooth seems to ignore your greeting,<br>
peering at the stone in front of him intently as if reading<br>
some invisible text. After a long while he sighs deeply<br>
and says, 'Somethin I kin help ye with, whoever you<br>
are?' <br>
<br>
You say, 'who are you talking to?' <br>
Normon Stonetooth speaks as he continues staring at<br>
the stone, 'I mine. So they call me a miner. Name's<br>
Normon, Normon Stonetooth, Normon the miner..,Did I<br>
say I mine?' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what do you mine?' <br>
Normon Stonetooth says 'Well I look fer Velium<br>
acourse. But ye know, I pull very little of it out o the<br>
mundane rock these days. Sometimes I hear it<br>
whisperin to me. The stone, the Velium, everything<br>
down here talks to each other. If ye're lucky enough<br>
they tell ya secrets. That be why I listen more these<br>
days than pull Velium. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what secrets?' <br>
Normon Stonetooth snickers and says, ' Now iffn I told<br>
ye that it wouldn't be a secret no more now would it?<br>
No, I cant tell ya what they tells me, but I kin help ya ta<br>
listen. But first ye'll need ta do me a favor heheh.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What favor?'<br>
Normon Stonetooth says 'Ahh, well me pick is a bit dull,<br>
don't cut like it should. Up in the city proper ye kin find<br>
a weapons smith named Hakon. Take me pick axe and<br>
and tell him Stonetooth sent ye. Then give it to him, wait<br>
fer him ta sharpen it, an bring it back to me. Then I'll<br>
help ya ta listen to the stone.' <br>
<br>
Hakon is in a weapon shop near the bank in Thurgadim. Give Hakon<br>
the Pick Axe and &quot;a small piece of velium&quot; (these are the stackable<br>
kind from Crystal Caverns, dropped off orc miners).<br>
<br>
Hakon Brightsteel says 'Excellent! I'll get ta work<br>
now.' Hakon whistles an unfamiliar tune as he repairs<br>
and sharpens the pick axe. 'Here ye are Zeldan . Watch<br>
that old Stonetooth, he's a few steins short of a keg, if<br>
ye know what I mean' <br>
<br>
You get the pick back plus the following faction adjustments: Coldain<br>
(better), DainFrostreaverIV (better), Kromzek (worse), and Kromrif<br>
(worse). Go back into the mines and return the pick axe to Normon. <br>
<br>
Normon Stonetooth says 'Ahhhh, good work Tashia.<br>
Now ta speak with the stone ye need somethin ta focus<br>
on. Use this piece o Velium as yer focus. Ta speak the<br>
language o the stone ye need ta slow down like the<br>
stone. Rock looks like it don't move but it does, just real<br>
slow. So place yer focus on the stones ye wish ta speak<br>
with and get yerself real slow, both yer body an yer<br>
noggin. Then if yer quiet enough ye might hear 'em. An<br>
that's what's to it. <br>
<br>
You receive an item in return called a Velium Focus. You then bring<br>
this Velium Focus item to Phenocryst, a named geonid in Wakening<br>
Land at -3210, -397 inside a maze of caves. You can hail him and<br>
such, the geonids conning indifferent to everybody as far as I can tell.<br>
It's very important to note that although geonids con indifferent<br>
or amiable, goo does not and if you get any of it on you and a<br>
geonid is close by, it'll aggro the geonid. No idea why this is, it<br>
doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.<br>
<br>
You say, hail Phenocryst. <br>
Phenocryst speaks with a soundless voice, as if you are<br>
hearing your own thoughts. 'We sense you are<br>
attempting communication with us but do not understand<br>
what it is you are trying to convey. We are eager to<br>
know more. Perhaps there is one who knows the<br>
language of the stone and will speak with us' <br>
<br>
Hand Phenocryst the Velium Focus. <br>
<br>
Phenocryst speaks to you from within your mind, 'You<br>
know the stone! This is wonderful! The fullfillment of<br>
the prophecy is now one step closer. The most ancient<br>
of the stone tells us that one not of stone will come forth<br>
and act as our harbringer of asscention. We believe you<br>
to be our harbringer. Please help us!' <br>
<br>
You say, 'how can I help you?'<br>
Phenocryst speaks from within your mind as well as<br>
conveys a sense of joy empathically. 'It is said that the<br>
harbringer will find all of our people and unite them.<br>
When we join we will know all of our experiences and<br>
perhaps then be aware of how to proceed with the next<br>
step in our asscention. We implore you to find others<br>
like us and make them aware of us. You know the<br>
language of the stone and can tell them. We await your<br>
return with proof that you have spoken to them.&quot; <br>
<br>
Now you have to go to Crystal Caverns. If you invis up and head<br>
down into the caverns, you'll pass through an orc area, then a dwarf<br>
area, then a tentacle terror and spiders area, and finally there's a long<br>
stretch of tunnel leading up to a zone out point. That long stretch of<br>
tunnel is filled with geonids and they con the same as the ones in<br>
Wakening Land. Give one of them the focus (any one, doesn't matter,<br>
you don't have to hail them or anything) and you'll get it back with the<br>
following message: <br>
<br>
A geonid seems as if it doesn't recognize you as<br>
anything of importance. You attempt to speak with the<br>
geonid through your velium focus but all you are able to<br>
hear is the same though over and over.., Eat. You have<br>
gained no knowledge from these creatures but you<br>
notice your focus has been altered slightly.<br>
<br>
The description on the focus doesn't change, but it is altered. Take it<br>
back to Phenocryst in Wakening Land and give it to him. The<br>
following will happen:<br>
<br>
Phenocryst sends it's thoughts to you, a feeling of<br>
disappointment washes over you, 'It seems the others<br>
are not aware of themselves yet. We are alone..So<br>
many questions yet we can find no answers. We have<br>
been given a very special gift but without direction we<br>
are lost. We must find who has made us aware of<br>
ourselves and why it has done so.' <br>
<br>
You say to Phenocryst, &quot;Find what?&quot; <br>
Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We must call<br>
to it. We must make ourselves heard past these rocks<br>
though. A menhir must be constructed to amplify our<br>
voice. The stones we will need are not found in this<br>
area though. We hear whispers of stones far away that<br>
have the ability to channel and amplify our thoughts. We<br>
ask you to gather these stones for us harbinger.&quot; <br>
<br>
You say to Phenocryst, &quot;I will gather these stones for<br>
you.&quot; <br>
Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank you<br>
Harbinger. We need 3 crystals. One of Beryl, one of<br>
Stibnite, and one of the purest Iron. These minerals will<br>
only be found deep within the earth where the geology<br>
is relatively stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the<br>
right crystals. Return it to me with the 3 crystals and we<br>
will construct our Menhir. Please hurry Harbinger, our<br>
prophecy awaits. <br>
<br>
Phenocryst gives you an item for telling him you'll gather the stones.<br>
It's a magic, lore, no drop Elbaite Focus that has 5 charges of<br>
Identify. It looks like a fire emerald. <br>
<br>
The stibnite crystal is found in The Great Divide. If you enter the<br>
wurm caves in the center of that zone from the south, go up to the<br>
first right, go in and take the next right, you'll be in a room with two<br>
spawn points for wurms and there's a patch of blue crystal at the<br>
back of the room. The stibnite is behind the crystals and looks like a<br>
bag on the floor. It spawns every 1-2 hours or so I think. The<br>
description of the item is &quot;Bent Metallic Crystal&quot;. It weights 20.0, is<br>
magic, lore, and no drop. When you identify it, it identifies as &quot;Stibnite<br>
for the Menhir&quot;. To identify an item using the Elbaite Focus, target<br>
yourself, pick up the item and right click it on the Elbaite Focus in<br>
your inventory. It won't change the description of the item, it'll just tell<br>
you what it is in your chat window. <br>
<br>
The Beryl crystal is in Split Paw. This crystal spawns deep in Paw<br>
behind one of the stone pillars near the entrance of the underwater<br>
tunnel leading to the Ishva area (+690, -17). The item is called a<br>
Reddish Crystal and it's also magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 10.0.<br>
It identifies as &quot;Beryl for the Menhir&quot;. <br>
<br>
The crystal of purest iron is in Burning Woods. It's sitting on the<br>
bottom edge of the crashed meteor (+842, -1179) near Slixin Klex and<br>
it looks like a bag on the ground. It's item description is &quot;Heavy<br>
Metallic Crystal&quot; and is magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 14.0. <br>
<br>
Take these three crystals and the Elbaite Focus back to Wakening<br>
Lands to Phenocryst and you're ready for the next step. Get 1-2<br>
parties of 50+ players and bring 'em with you. Due to the dragon that<br>
spawns in Wakening Land near the dragon portal, you might want to<br>
approach from skyshrine. If you're going along the wall from<br>
skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your troops at the<br>
second cave entrance along the wall. Phenocryst is closest to that<br>
entrance. Get to know the path between you and him at this point so<br>
you're familiar with how to get out in a hurry. At this point, all the<br>
geonids should con amiable to you. Finishing the Velium Focus section<br>
achieves this faction adjustment. Make sure you have a ranger in<br>
your party of friends. You're going to have to track down some<br>
triggered MOBs and fight them. You submit the items to Phenocryst. <br>
<br>
Phenocryst makes no sound but it's voice fills your<br>
mind. 'We have always held our memories within the<br>
earth and stone but only recently have we become<br>
aware of them. We do not know what happened or who<br>
gave us this wonderful gift but we can now access<br>
those memories and are aware of it's storage. With that<br>
knowledge has come questions and desires. When the<br>
prophecy comes to be then we will have our answers<br>
and fulfill our desires.' <br>
<br>
Phenocryst 's familiar thoughts flood into your mind<br>
again, 'You truly are the Harbinger, take this Focus as a<br>
mark of your friendship with us. Now we can construct<br>
the Menhir, we need ..,..,the stones speak.., There is a<br>
problem. Ones of flesh are coming, the large ones, 3 of<br>
them. They must not disturb us while we construct the<br>
Menhir! Please stop them Harbinger! bring us proof of<br>
their distruction along with your Focus and then we will<br>
begin the calling. Our asscention is at hand!'<br>
<br>
You lose the focus and the three crystals and in return gain another<br>
focus item with the description &quot;Azurite Focus&quot;. It's a magic, lore, no<br>
drop item weighing 0.5. <br>
<br>
Now head outside and start tracking. After a few minutes, two<br>
&quot;accolyte of Zek&quot; giants will show up on track. A minute later or so, a<br>
Bloodpriest Loukond will show up on tracker as well. You'll have to<br>
run out and pull the accolytes to you once you track them. If they are<br>
snared, they still run quite fast. These giants con blue at 52 and are<br>
quite magic resistant. Make sure you pull these, they're almost more<br>
important than the Bloodpriest. They get attacked by the various<br>
mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before you can do<br>
the job. If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do. After<br>
killing both accolytes, loot them. Each one has a medalion that has the<br>
description, &quot;Holy Symbol of Zek&quot;, which is magic, no drop, and<br>
weighs 2.0. After the accolytes are done, go out and get the<br>
Bloodpriest. Bloodpriest Loukond should eventually walk up to the<br>
cave entrance and stand outside it if nobody pulls it. After a minute of<br>
standing outside the cave, he depops, which is why you have to do the<br>
accolytes first (they pop first) then the bloodpriest (he'll get to the<br>
cave probably if you can't find him, the accolytes might not). The<br>
bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is just as magic resistant. He drops a<br>
third and final medalion with the same description. You must get all<br>
three medalions in order to for this part to prove fruitful. When you<br>
kill the giants, you take the following faction hits: Kromzek (worse),<br>
Kromrif (worse), KingTormax (worse), and ClawsofVeeshan<br>
(better). The giants never enter the caves to attack the geonids or<br>
anything. Everything will happen outside the caves and the giants<br>
won't aggro the dragon if it's up either. The Bloodpriest Loukond is<br>
also not to be confused with Priest Bjek, another giant who wanders<br>
in the area sometimes who is red at 52 and not related to this quest. <br>
<br>
Now. Take your Azurite Focus and the three medalions to<br>
Phenocryst. Submit them to Phenocryst. <br>
<br>
Phenocryst 's thoughts become your own, a feeling of<br>
joy overwhelms you, 'Because of you we can at last<br>
speak with our maker. We were once given a gift, and<br>
we ask that you accept this gift from us now so that we<br>
may come closer to that which we owe our sentience<br>
to. Now..,we must construct the Menhir..' <br>
<br>
You lose the Azurite Focus and medalions and get the following item<br>
in return, which is, it seems, the reward for this quest.<br>
<br>
Pheny's Focus item stats (since I could not copy the box here doh )<br>
<br>
Magic item, Lore item, no drop<br>
AC 5<br>
Sex 3<br>
Cha 3<br>
Int 10 Mana 40<br>
Sv fire +3, Sv cold +3, Sv disease +3, Sv poison +3, sv magic +5<br>
<br>
Nec, Wiz, Mage, Enc<br>
<br>
Then then geonids, led by Phenocryst, start walking around, through<br>
the halls and such. When this happens, you see the following<br>
message: <br>
<br>
&quot;Phenocryst begins to resonate. All the stones about you<br>
begin to resonate seemingly at its command. The<br>
Geonids all begin moving, all to construct the Menhir.&quot; <br>
<br>
At this point, all of the surrounding genoids as well as Phenocryst<br>
embark on a journey through the caverns and out into the forest area<br>
of Wakening Lands. The go about 300 yards out and down the hill<br>
and combine into one large genoid called the Menhir. After about 20<br>
seconds, the Menhir starts to emote some noises and warns you that<br>
it is about to explode. I suggest doing so for the end result is the<br>
Menhir imploding and setting off the AE of Supernova. It's very<br>
important to note that although geonids con indifferent or<br>
amiable, goo does not and if you get any of it on you and a<br>
geonid is close by, it'll aggro the geonid. No idea why this is, it<br>
doesn't make any sense, but it's the case. Also, enchanters can skip<br>
a huge chunk of this quest by casting Collaboration on Phenocryst and<br>
starting from the point where to say to him &quot;I will gather these stones<br>
for you&quot;. The Velium Focus half gives you the faction to be able to<br>
tell that to Phenocryst. Provided an enchanter MAKES him amiable,<br>
they don't have to bother with the first half.<br>
