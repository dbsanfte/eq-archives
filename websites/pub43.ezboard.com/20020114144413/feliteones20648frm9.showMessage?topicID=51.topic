<br>
Rheaton says: Dont ask me where i get this stuff....nor expect that i believe it all :P<br>
/shurg<br>
 <br>
Have you noticed how it¹s not raining much again; how most of the weather fronts that have managed to come through this season have been dissipated and broken up? Have you noticed the occasional weird cloud shapes that appear with the few fronts that do manage to pass by? And how the jet stream has been forced North again? How high pressure ridges continue to dominate the Southwest? <br>
<br>
Some say the rain is being turned on (last year) and off (during the preceding 7-year drought and again this season) by an irritated and vengeful God. In reality, however, it is Man who is playing God and doing the dirty work. None of this is illusory or accidental, for there is powerful and compelling evidence that the bizarre weather patterns of recent years have been - to a very large degree - engineered, controlled, and influenced by both the Russian and American governments. To those of you familiar with the work of the supermind of Nikola Tesla, the following will not come as much of a surprise. <br>
<br>
On the Fourth of July, 1976, the former Soviet Union began broadcasting huge, pulsed electromagnetic fields from three gigantic 40-million watt transmitters which beamed those signals halfway around the world to the U.S. This electronic assault disrupted and jammed radio and television broadcast signals, enraged the FCC, and irritated ham radio operators, who quickly dubbed the signals 'The Russian Woodpecker,' because of their pulsed cadence. <br>
<br>
To date, the Russians have completed nearly 30 of the huge transmitters which emit signals primarily in the very dangerous 10-Hertz range, otherwise known as Extreme Low Frequency (ELF). The technology is based on the brilliant work of the peerless electrical genius, Nikola Tesla. So, what exactly does the 'Russian Woodpecker' do and how does it do it? Consider the following: <br>
<br>
These 'Tesla' transmitters create massive 'standing' ELF waves that form major high pressure 'blocking systems' that change the normal high altitude jet stream pattern, force it to the north, and actually retard the normal flow patterns of incoming weather systems. Ever notice the television weather satellite pictures showing the jet stream pushed north and a big stationary high pressure blocking nearly every major rain system that approaches the southern half of California?... <br>
<br>
Regarding the 7-year drought, which appears to be rearing its arid head again, the 1/13/93 edition of Discovery Magazine stated: <br>
<br>
Scientists would be happy if they learned one thing from this (seven year) drought: What causes the massive high pressure system to build up just off the California coast and stay there, like a double-parked delivery truck in rush-hour traffic, pushing storms to the north?<br>
Odd things were also being reported back in the winters of the early 1980's: <br>
<br>
A ridge of high pressure has hovered nearly 800 miles off the California Coast for the past two months, blocking the usual flow of moist air from the Pacific. <br>
 --Time 1/1981 <br>
For the past four months, a single weather pattern...causing the drought is one of the most unusual national patterns ever recorded...such long lasting (high pressure) centers were unheard of until 1977 (when the Soviets began the 'Woodpecker' transmissions --ed.) <br>
 --Washington Post 2/2/81 <br>
It is important to note that the end of the 7-year California drought in the winter of 1992-93 coincided exactly with the well-documented period of intense solar magnetic storms that disrupted all electromagnetic transmissions here on Earth including the 'Woodpecker.' <br>
<br>
Last summer's Midwest flooding was probably no accident, either. <br>
<br>
An unusual shift in the jet stream, acting as a barrier (is causing the floods)...<br>
 --Newsweek 7/26/93 <br>
The stagnant high pressure zone acted like a barrier, preventing the normal flow of weather patterns from west to east... <br>
 New York Times 7/29/93 <br>
It is extremely unusual for weather patterns to persist for so many weeks. The reasons for the weather patterns to become fixed...are unclear.<br>
--Storm, The World Weather Magazine 9/93 <br>
As far back in April, 1969, Spectrum, a publication of the prestigious Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, featured an article by Seymour Tilson which stated: <br>
<br>
Workers in the field of atmospheric electricity and cloud physics have accumulated sufficient evidence to suggest that electric fields in the Earth¹s lower atmosphere play a critical role...perhaps the critical role...in the development and behavior of clouds that produces precipitation. <br>
Mr. Tilson was correct. Exactly one year after the 'birth' of the Russian Woodpecker, July 4, 1978, the U.S. Government conducted its own ELF weather experiment which created an enormous downpour of rain over six counties of northern Wisconsin. This ELF-generated storm generated winds of 157 mph and caused $50 million in damage, levelling Phillips, Wisconsin, and destroying 350,000 hectares of forest. <br>
<br>
The first published alarm about Soviet weather control warfare came from Dr. Andrew Michrowski of PACE (Planetary Association for Clean Energy). In a published paper in 1978, Dr. Michrowski described how he had placed monitoring stations all across Canada and determined that &quot;the Soviets managed to establish relatively stable and localized ELF fields (over North America) which were able to hamper or divert the jet stream flow in the Northern Hemisphere.&quot; <br>
<br>
Several years later, Michrowski stated in a PACE Newsletter (Vol.4, #4): <br>
<br>
ELF fields...propagate vertically to the ground, creating 'standing waves'...that can redistribute energy and momentum in (atmosphere) through cumulus convection. It has been consistently noted that variance of the (Soviet) ELF transmissions leads to a subsequent change in the route of the jet stream flow in the Northern Hemisphere within 72 hours. <br>
The 2/81 PACE Newsletter reported that the Soviets turned off their ELF Woodpecker signal for a brief period in 1980: &quot;During the two-week lull, the Northern Hemisphere's jet stream was NORMAL... ...with the return of the Soviet ELF transmissions, the jet stream was deflected (again) by a persistent (high) pressure ridge extending from the Yukon to Arizona.&quot; <br>
<br>
There is much more, but I think you get the picture. 'Everyone complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about it,' doesn¹t function any more. Nikola Tesla said, in June, 1900, &quot; The time is very near when we shall have the precipitation of the moisture of the atmosphere under complete control...&quot; If you have ever read a biography of the great genius, you'll know he wasn't joking. <br>
<br>
Does the U.S. government have its own series of ELF/microwave transmitters? You bet. Can ELF be used to do more than engineer and influence just the weather (like human beings, for example)? Yes, it CAN and IS. But that's another story... <br>

He has had all kinds of whacky things attributed to him. Like Nostradomous, any conspiricy loving frootloop cites Tesla's mad experiments and his mad geneous.  HE has hundreds of pattents, he invented the AC engine, He was truly a brilliant man. He was also a very misguided person with a head full of unrealistic idealisms.  This ELF you speak of is nothing more than a rehash of his 1906 (1906 if memory serves me well) Colorodo Springs experiment where he blew up a power plant.<br>
 He also believed he caused the 1917 siberian event that leveled hundreds of acres of forest and was the largest explosion in the history of man. (most scientist believe we were struck by a commet).<br>
  There is a theory among science fiction buffs and official UFO watch groups that a civilization advances by gaining certain technological abilities. we are concidered a level 2  or class 2 civilization, the required ability to reach level 3 is the ability to control our weather. so to prove that there are Aliens out there who can do these &quot;magical&quot; things they must prove that our government is hiding this from us. To do this they construe madcap ideas like this as proof of alien life...  its a small leap dont really feel like going through it all here but if you go to the websight coasttocoast.com  or do a search for coast to coast, (Art Bells radio program M-F midnight to 5am central) you will find much more information on controling the weather, tesla, Alien abduction, government conspiracy to initiate a new world order, ghost, demons, and a host of other X-files type of topics.<br>
  I really enjoy listening to his program and would recomend it to anybody with a healthy sense of sceptacism.<br>
