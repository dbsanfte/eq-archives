Court Upholds Ban on Kids <br>
By Sarah Wyatt<br>
Associated Press Writer<br>
Tuesday, July 10, 2001; 8:34 p.m. EDT<br>
<br>
MADISON, Wis. –– The state Supreme Court, splitting along gender lines, ruled Tuesday that a man who owes $25,000 in child support can be ordered not to father any more children while he's on probation. <br>
<br>
In 1999, David Oakley, the 34-year-old father of nine, was placed on probation for five years by a county circuit judge and ordered not to father more children, unless he showed means to support them all. He faced eight years in jail if he failed to comply. <br>
<br>
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court's four male justices upheld the ban. <br>
<br>
&quot;Here is a man who has shown himself time and again to be totally and completely irresponsible,&quot; wrote Justice William Bablitch for the majority. &quot;It is overwhelmingly obvious that any child he fathers in the future is doomed to a future of neglect, abuse, or worse.&quot; <br>
<br>
The three female justices disagreed, saying that having children is a basic human right guaranteed by the Constitution. <br>
<br>
The high court is the first in the nation to declare such a ban legal, even though it would be difficult to enforce and could end up coercing women into having abortions, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley wrote. <br>
<br>
&quot;It places the woman in an untenable position: have an abortion or be responsible for Oakley going to prison for eight years,&quot; Bradley wrote. <br>
<br>
Oakley has nine children by four women – sons ages 4, 5, 10 and 12, and daughters ages 3, 12, 16 and two who are 13. In his appeal, he argued the ban violated his constitutional right; a federal appeals court ruled against him earlier. <br>
<br>
Prosecutor Thomas Balistreri said the ruling applies only to people like Oakley who refuse to pay child support, not to those who cannot pay. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's not a crime to be unable to afford to pay child support,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Oakley's lawyer, Timothy Kay, said in a statement the decision could open a &quot;Pandora's Box&quot; if it is expanded to other child support cases. <br>
<br>
Julie Sternberg, of the American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom Project, agreed that the decision could set a precedent in Wisconsin and subvert the rights of fathers who cannot pay child support. <br>
<br>
&quot;No matter how insupportable this defendant may or may not be, to require that he not have children as a condition of his sentence is clearly a violation of the Constitution,&quot; she said. <br>
<br>
In its decision, the high court noted that Oakley would have been unable to have children anyway if he had received a longer prison term instead of probation. <br>

<br>
Wow.  What a stupid statement!  That any woman would be responsible for him not putting a condom on, or something similar.  Ridiculous!!!<br>
<br>
Not sayong I agree with the ruling or not, but that one statement struck me very wrong!<br>

1. Can anyone tell two people that they cannot have a child?<br>
2. There was no mention of rape...why wasnt the woman equally punished?<br>
3. Do we have to prove to the courts or law that we can support a child prior to having one? And when i say &quot;we&quot; i am referring to males only..obviously.<br>
<br>
This guy is a complete dufuss. A shame to society and himself. He has knowingly engaged in the act of conception knowing full well of how the reprodutive process works. He did this knowing that he could end up a father and not have anyway of supporting the child (children).... So has the woman (women).<br>
<br>
Then judged on his inability to support them...and to what standard i dont know.. im guessing at least cloth and feed them...NEway, he is then accused and found guilty of &quot;reckless reproduction&quot;.... Not just failure to support what he produced...he and the other women that is.<br>
<br>
Should the guy be a father to anymore children?.. i dont think so. But we do not have the right or AUTHORITY to say weither he can or cannot?  No, we do not.<br>
This judgement was an abuse of power and extremly un-constitutional.<br>

<br>
It may have violated the constitution but face it, that thing needs to be re-written anyway.  It has served its purpose for a long time because it is vague.  There is no way someone could know what the United States of America would be like almost 250 years later, so how am I supposed to believe that this piece of paper is always right.  I think judges should have the authority to judge on what they think is the right thing to do, not on what they think is constitutional.  This man has no means to provide for the chidren he has and keeps pumping out new ones.  Just putting him in jail gives him no chance to start paying what he owes.<br>
 <br>
I think this was a great descision on this judges part and I salute him for standing up for what he feels is right.<br>

who needs a constitution anyway.  All we need are laws.  A constitution does nothing but give people a way to break rules.  No one ever wants to talk about the constitution until it helps them in some way.  Who gives a crap about someones right to have children,  I have a right to quit supporting his kids.  The constitution doesn't make the USA a better place.  If anything it hurts us.  Look at the past.  It took one person screaming about it being unconstitutional for prayers in school.  You know what, just for that whiner we dropped prayers for school and you know what we got in return?  Guns.  Lots of them.  Kids lost their morals about that same time.  You dont like prayers in school?  Cover your ears, I like the morals and values that these prayers bestow on our young ones.  I am not religious by any means, in fact I would consider myself an atheist (sp).  I still feel the Bible is a great book to live by.  So if you want a peice of paper that tells you what you can and cant do, throw that piece of paper called The Constitution away and put the  King James version in its place.<br>

<br>
The bible has good morals to live by yes.  But the second we make IT the law of the land, it becomes how you have described our Constitution.  A means of persecution (eg salem witch trials).  That book is even more open to interpretation than is the constitution.  The Constitution is a brilliant piece of writing because the words contained within have stood the test of time.  Is it perfect?  No!  Will it ever be?  No.  It was written by man. (as was the bible btw).  Man is fallable.  Does it need to be altered from tiem to time?  Yep.  The true genius of that document stands in the fact that built in was the right to change it.  And this has happened many times over the course of the last 250 years.  These are called Ammendments.    The first ten being the Bill of Rights.<br>
<br>
NEway.  Do I think this imbecile should have any more kids?  good gods no!  He is a miserable excuse for a human being and a dishonor to the male half of our species. Should the courts say he CAN'T have any more kids.  Well...  I am not sure.  But I think that any woman that has a child with him had better understand what she is getting into.  Who knows, one of these children may turn out to be the next Martin Luther King, or JFK.  Or Einstein.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
To sum up:<br>
<br>
Constitution:  Good, and good guidline to run a country.<br>
Bible:  Good fiction book full of great morals to live your personal life by.  A HORRIBLE way to run a country.<br>
The idiot in question:  well, he's an idiot and shouldn't have any more kids.<br>
