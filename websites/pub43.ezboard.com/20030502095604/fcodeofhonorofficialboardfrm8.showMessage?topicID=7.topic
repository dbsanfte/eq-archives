<br>
***<br>
<br>
My story begins a few years back, during happier times, when I lived with<br>
my mother and father in the region now commonly called Lesser Faydark.  In<br>
those days, before the passing of the shadow, the land for the most part<br>
was safe.  We worked a small farm in the Northern region and would sell<br>
vegetables to the locals, or at times, my mother would venture out to the<br>
bigger settlements and return with supplies.  That being said, we pretty<br>
much kept to ourselves.  You see my father was a human, and my mother,<br>
being a woodelf, had no desire to bring attention upon themselves, as<br>
their marriage was not warmly accepted among either of their people.  And<br>
so we lived in relative isolation, but life was good, and we were happy.<br>
<br>
It was during those days that I learned to work the land and love the<br>
woods.  My mother and I would often go on long walks through the forest,<br>
speaking in Elvish, where she taught me of bird and flower, beast and<br>
plant, and everything else Tunare made grow. My father, on the other hand,<br>
spent most of his time on the farm, and while he was few with words,<br>
managed to teach me of reading, writing, numbers, and far off places,<br>
filled with imagination and wonder.  Whenever I would venture to ask him<br>
of his own past and beginnings, he would frown heavily and say, &quot;My life<br>
did not begin 'till I met your mother lad, and before that it was but a<br>
shadow.  Ask of it no more&quot; And though that is all I could ever get out of<br>
him about his own life, I was content with the answer.  It would be a many<br>
moons later, on a cold fall's eve, before I would truly understand the<br>
meaning behind his words.<br>
<br>
I can still recall the events of that week clearly in my mind.  It had<br>
been overcast for several days and many began to wonder if the sun would<br>
ever come out again.  Worse yet, there had been rumors that orcs had<br>
vomited forth from a previously unknown mountain stronghold and were now<br>
laying siege to Kelethin.  Tales of orcish raiding parties, sent to lay<br>
waste to the countryside and cut off supply lines, were rampant.  And with<br>
each waking hour, my mother and father grew more grim.  At one point, my<br>
mother turned to my father and said, &quot;Durlan, you know what I must do.<br>
The others are rallying at the pass to Greater Fay to try and hold off the<br>
raiders, and if I do not join them, the line may collapse.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, go to your kin Ellenia.  If only I could join you&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NODurlan, look at me.  You know what they'd do if they found out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Found out what?&quot; I asked, but got no response.  My mother turned to me<br>
and touched my cheek, tears in her eyes.  She then hugged and kissed my<br>
father and ran out the door. I moved to follow but father grabbed my<br>
shoulder&quot;Stay,&quot; he whispered.  A look at his face told me the comment was<br>
more for himself than for me.<br>
<br>
The next hour or so, or maybe more, was hell.  Off in the distance was the<br>
sound of thunder, and as dusk turned to night flashes would illuminate the<br>
sky.  The air became heavy and thick, and a smoke colored mist seemed to<br>
blanket the land.  All the while, my father sat staring at the wall,<br>
motionless, hands clinching the arms of the chair so hard that his<br>
knuckles turned a pasty white.<br>
<br>
When the drums started I screamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father, do something!  What's wrong with you? Mother may be out there,<br>
dead already, and you sit here and do nothing!&quot;<br>
<br>
There was no answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father, get up!&quot; I pleaded.<br>
<br>
What happened next was a blur.  All I remember was forcing the door open<br>
and running towards the flashes.  &quot;Mother,&quot; I whispered.  Branches slapped<br>
my face, at some point I tripped, and yet all the while, I drew closer to<br>
the light.  The sound of drums pounded ever louder in my mind, and I began<br>
to hear voices.<br>
<br>
I topped a rise, and then fell to my knees at the scene I saw below.  Orcs<br>
were pouring out of the pass to Greater Fay, while a small number of<br>
defenders - gnomes, dwarves, and elves, engaged them in close combat.  The<br>
defense was composed of a ragtag band of warrior farmers that made a<br>
semi-circle style formation around the mouth of the pass.  Behind them<br>
were an additional number of defenders that sent arrows into the line of<br>
charging orcs, and then would finish off those attackers that managed to<br>
break through the first defense.  Several paces behind this second line<br>
was a third group that appeared to just sit and watch the conflict.  Every<br>
moment or so one would stand up and fire or lightening would erupt from<br>
their hands and explode among the orcs.  Others would pass among the<br>
combatants and touch them with a bluish or greenish glow.  I saw my mother<br>
among this third group.<br>
<br>
For several moments, hours maybe, I watched the battle unfold at the pass,<br>
too scared to move.  The defenders were slowly losing their numbers<br>
against the relentless charge of orcs.  When I saw those of the third<br>
group begin to stand among the first in an attempt to fill the ranks of<br>
fallen comrades, I knew they would soon be over-run.  My mother now paced<br>
behind the one remaining line, light playing off her fingers, and seconds<br>
later, even that line collapsed for good.  Some defenders took off into<br>
the woods, while the rest of the line folded into a circle with the<br>
remaining casters in the center.  A lone dwarf fighter in brilliant chain<br>
armor who was separated from the main group, screamed aloud as a sea of<br>
yellow and blue engulfed him.<br>
<br>
Watching my mother, caught in the center of the remaining defenders, I<br>
began to cry.  I realized that I had never really known her, or knew that<br>
she was capable of such wonderful magic, and now I was going to see her<br>
die.<br>
<br>
Lost in this thought, I grew cold, chills ran down my spine.  Something<br>
touched my shoulder as if the icy hand of death itself.  I looked toward<br>
the sensation and opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out.<br>
Beside me was the very figure of a nightmare, a black clad knight of<br>
terror.  The nightmare raised a dark gauntlet to my head and I closed my<br>
eyes, awaiting the killing blow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stay,&quot; was all a voice said.<br>
<br>
The chill subsided and I slowly opened my eyes.  I watched as the black<br>
knight strode down the hill towards the battle, the armor gathering<br>
shadows as it went.  A mighty two handed sword was raised in the air, and<br>
it's weight came crashing down upon the backs of the first few orcs that<br>
stood before it.  The figure then channeled and green fire rained from the<br>
sky, and another orc was absorbed by a yellow orb and then collapsed in a<br>
shriveled heap.  As the orcs turned to face their new threat, some howled<br>
in terror and began to run.  Others tried to rush the attacker but were<br>
met with a shield of thorns that suddenly engulfed the black knight but<br>
did not seem to harm him.<br>
<br>
My mother now stood behind the figure and I marveled at her courage to<br>
stand close to that terror.  Orc after orc fell before the two-hander and<br>
the nightmare that wielded it.  The sight was both glorious and terrifying<br>
to behold.  Moments later, the remaining orcs were fleeing and the dark<br>
knight turned and gave my mother the sword.  Kneeling down before her, she<br>
pulled off the helmet to reveal the face of her husband, my father.<br>
<br>
All this time I had been watching the battle from the top of the hill, and<br>
still I stood watching now.  My father is a shadowknight? I kept repeating<br>
to myself.  Fear, anger, and disgust washed over me until I could feel no<br>
more.  My mother raised up the sword as if she would cleave my father's<br>
head from his shoulders - I stood there, watching, numb to the world - and<br>
then she threw it to the side.  Taking his head into her arms, she pulled<br>
him close, and I closed my eyes<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
That was the last I ever saw of my father, though I did not know it at the<br>
time.  I woke up the next day in the woods besides a campfire.  My mother<br>
was there, cooking something she had found in the forest.  She smiled at<br>
me, but I didn't speak.  I couldn't even think straight.  I had spent my<br>
whole life learning to hate the very thing my father embodied, and what<br>
was I supposed to do now.  How could I even look him in the face?<br>
<br>
At some point I said to my mother, &quot;You two lied to melied to me about<br>
your past, about who you were, what you were&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No-one lied to you Arafas, you just lead yourself to believe something<br>
else.  Your going to learn in the future that things aren't always what<br>
you think they are.  Your father, myself, our life even, was but a dream<br>
while it lasted, though a beautiful dream it was.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How can you say that?&quot; I yelled at her.  &quot;It was real, I was there!<br>
Yesterday we were a family, and my FATHER wasn't some, some damn demon!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Arafas, once again you make the mistake of seeing only what's on the<br>
surface.  Yes, our life was wonderful, and believe it or not, that whole<br>
time your father was still a master of the dark arts, one that loved and<br>
loves you dearly.&quot;<br>
<br>
I frowned but my mother continued, &quot;When we met and fell in love your<br>
father gave up his practice so that we might be together.  And for a<br>
while, he was able tobut unfortunately, that is not how the wheel of life<br>
turns.  Times are changing, the shadow is stirring and while we have<br>
rested, the Gods have been at war.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Arafas, for too long have you seen through a child's eyes, it is time to<br>
grow up.  I've watched you grow, seen your abilities, enough so to know<br>
that neither your father nor I can train you.  Take this note.  It<br>
contains the name of a person who can help you develop your abilities.&quot;<br>
<br>
I looked at her, mouth open in disbelief, voice quivering, &quot;Your leaving<br>
me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In presence, yes, but know that my heart and mind will always be with<br>
you.  We cannot return to the way things were, and even if we could, there<br>
are those here who would have your father killed because they believe he<br>
is incapable of anything good.  So he now fights for the future and I must<br>
join him.  In time, you will acquire the skills to do the same, and may<br>
even join us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Great sorrow played across my mother's face, but I could barely look at<br>
her.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
And so we journeyed to Kelethin where we would depart ways.  I will never<br>
forget how sad she looked as we stood outside the Ranger's guild that day.<br>
Anger and sorrow fought inside my mind, but anger won out and I turned my<br>
back to her without even saying goodbye.  Forever will I regret that<br>
action.  As I pushed the door open to Faydark's Champions she yelled,<br>
&quot;Arafas, know that we love you.&quot;  I walked on through the door, and that<br>
was the last I heard her voice.<br>
<br>
Since then, my training has been slow but I have learned much.  Like most<br>
new rangers I spent my first few seasons learning to use a sword and a bow<br>
and protecting the lifts.  As the war with Crushbone raged on and my<br>
skills grew, I was assigned the more difficult tasks of raiding the orc<br>
camps and holding orc hill.  Here I learned the value of a good group and<br>
to place my trust in others.  Around my eighth season I was confident<br>
enough in my abilities that I felt I was ready to see something of the<br>
world.  I set out for Freeport, where I met a halfling named Bungo.  At<br>
the time Bungo was leader of the Grey Companions, a guild known in the<br>
Faydarks for protecting elves and trying to unite the &quot;light&quot; races.  I<br>
asked if I could sign on and in that guild I remained many seasons.<br>
<br>
After a refreshing beer at the Jade Tiger's Inn in North Freeport, I told<br>
Bungo of my interest in meeting the human rangers of Surefall Glade, so we<br>
set out for Qeynos.  The trip was long but fun, as everything was new and<br>
exciting.  I will never forget the multicolored sunsets over the desert,<br>
the darkness of Kithicor Forest, or the sprawling plains of the Karanas.<br>
After reaching Qeynos, I trained and soloed for a few seasons around<br>
Surefall.  I especially enjoyed returning to West Karana and taking down<br>
the big cats.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, about this time I also learned that elves, even the<br>
half-human ones, weren't the most popular race on the continent.  Many<br>
times I was beaten badly by humans who felt Qeynos would be a lot better<br>
off if elves weren't around at all.  Once I was even attacked by druids in<br>
Surefall Glade of all places!  The straw that broke the pixie's back was<br>
when I had spent the whole day helping humans fight the undead invasion of<br>
Qeynos Hills, only to be attacked that evening by the same humans.  Later<br>
on that night I met Chiron, another halfelf with whom I had fought with at<br>
orc hill, and we decided to return home.  Back home, I spent most of my<br>
time venturing ever deeper into Crushbone, battling orcs, and obtained my<br>
20th season along with right to have a last name, Swiftwulfe.<br>
<br>
Since then, my journeys have me taken many places.  I spent my 20s and<br>
early 30s defending the human stronghold of HighPass, and earning the<br>
respect of those that lived there.  Around the time I progressed to my<br>
35th season of training, the elven princess Firiona Vie was abducted and<br>
the perpetrators followed to a new land, Kunark!  Firiona's father ordered<br>
all those able and willing to setup an elven stronghold on the new land<br>
and search for Firiona.  My guild, now called the Company of Light,<br>
responded in force and scouted the new lands in the name of the King.  We<br>
also did battle with a new force of evil, a legion of lizard people called<br>
Iksar that were in league with the Darkelves.<br>
<br>
For many seasons I have hunted in Kunark and can even now wander land as a<br>
brother of the wolves.  While I have seen many things grow corrupted from<br>
the forces of power, greed and evil, I still hold hope in my heart.  My<br>
former guilds, the Grey and the Company, have fallen under the shadow and<br>
are a memory of the distant past.  But now I am a member of a brotherhood<br>
so strong that its very name brings both fear and respect to our enemies<br>
and allies alike, the Code of Honor.  Our guild grows stronger, ventures<br>
onto to the undiscovered lands of Velious, and carries the truth of our<br>
Gods.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
To this day I keep an ever watchful eye out for my parents, but no news<br>
has come my way.  I like to think they watch over me though.  Once, I<br>
spotted a mist wolf and shadow wolf together looking down on me from a<br>
hill.  By the time I reached the crest they were gone, but the situation<br>
struck me as odd and I began to wonder.  I have made many trips to Lesser<br>
Faydark since then, but it is not the home I remember.  Now it is overrun<br>
with orcs and bandits, so seldom do I return. Finally, I still struggle to<br>
accept who my father was.  While the Code shuns all who practice the dark<br>
arts, I have adventured with some necromancers and shadowknights.  I have<br>
learned that sometimes, to fight evil you must know it.<br>
<br>
In the end, love and acceptance is what we all quest forMother, Father, if<br>
your out there, hold on to each other, for you have the most precious gift<br>
of all.<br>
<br>
May the Mist Wolf lie with the Shadow Wolf forever, <br>
                Arafas Swiftwulfe...<br>
