Defiant, on Wednesday Jan 2nd 2002 at 12am PST (3am EST, 9am Euro time), will be  KoSing the server.  This will be for a period of just over 2 weeks and will end on Friday Jan 18th 2002 (11:59 pm PST ).  As of the above mentioned start date, if you do not fly a Defiant tag you will be KoS to the guild with the only exception being AO.  Though AO is not going to be assisting Defiant in this endeavor, if they choose to that would be entirely up to them.  This event has been in the works for some time now but it has been decided to delay it to the start of the new year so that more people would be able to participate.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this is to encourage PvP on VZ as well as to provide fun for everyone.  There are a lot of people on the server these days that do not have much in the way of constant PvP that was prevalent during the early stages of the server.  This will also give everyone that has wanted to take a shot at Defiant in PvP, but didn’t for whatever reason, a chance to do just that.   This is for fun and to try and increase the amount of PvP if only for a short time.  <br>
<br>
I hope that everyone can participate with a minimal amount of grief play.  Defiant will put forth an effort to limit any grief play from our end and we hope that everyone else will do so as well.  There will be no repercussions from Defiant for clean PvP after the stated stop date.  However, if you grief Defiant members that can and will carry over after this event has concluded.<br>
<br>
During this time, expect to be attacked by Defiant members.  Expect to be attacked while low on health, oom, afk.  Expect to be attacked while trying to xp.  This is PvP, not club med.<br>
<br>
If you take an exp death as a result of Defiant members attacking you, the Defiant members (unless you are being a total @#%$, or causing the xp death by trying to train Defiant members etc.) will do what they can to get you a rez.  This may or may not happen, if there are no Defiant clerics on at the time it would be difficult for them to get you a rez, but the attempt will be made.<br>
<br>
Loot and Scoot.  This will be enforced at the discretion of the Defiant member(s) that killed you.  They may or may not ask you to LnS.  If you’re unsure if you should LnS ask your killer.  If you refuse to LnS expect to be killed again.  If you bind rush, expect to be killed again.  If you get killed and are being an @#%$ about it, expect to be killed again.  If you get killed and are hanging around your corpse but not looting and leaving, expect to be killed again.  If you get killed say in DL and you loot and zone into KC and then attack a Defiant member right away, expect to be killed again etc etc.  If you are killed and after looting your corpse and trying to leave the area and are attacked and/or killed again I’ll tell you now it wasn’t intentional.  If someone in Defiant kills you not everyone in Defiant will know that it happened.<br>
<br>
I’ve posted this notification of this event on some of the major lightie guild boards (not Darks or 4-teams ‘cause well after all they are always KoS to Defiant so this doesn’t really affect them all that much)  The reason of this notification is to cut down the number of  tells that Defiant officers will receive due to this event.  I know it would be a lot more fun to just do it with no warnings, but that could cause large amounts of tell spam for the officers.<br>
<br>
There will be a reward for the person that kills the most Defiant members during this time.  If you wish to apply for this reward you must do the following:<br>
<br>
1) take a SS of each kill shot on a Defiant member (these will be verified)<br>
2) create a Strike9 account (www.strike9.com) and upload all kill shots to there.<br>
3) Email me the link to your screenshots at Zalendar@Defiantvz.com  DO NOT! Email me screen shots.  Screen shots that are emailed to me wont be considered for this contest.<br>
<br>
There will be a reward for each kill of Zegelmorph, that reward will be some cookies provided by Defiant bakers.  To claim this reward send link of  SS of kill shot to my email addy listed above.<br>
<br>
These rewards are up for grabs for anyone that is in range of Defiant members and care to apply for it and my decision is final with regard to winners.<br>
<br>
Have fun, and good hunting.<br>
