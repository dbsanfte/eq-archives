<br>
A few days ago I was told by a guild mate that someone had sent them a tell asking about me. They had handed over 45Kp to a char named Jensinn (or Jinseen) for the payment on a Mosquito Leg earring. The scammer had claimed to be an Alt of mine, and would be right back with the item. Yup, I can hear all the groans of yas, just like I did when I heard. Well needless to say. the person camped and never came back.<br>
I spoke at some lenght to the victim about this, and he ended up about 50 percent sure that I was not the crook. For those that know me, they will understand how much store I put into honor and my word, and that 50 percent aint good enough!<br>
Yesterday I was sent a tell from a different guild member while I was on an alt. He wondered if the person asking to buy his Swiftblade of Zek was really an alt of mine?! I practically leapt down his throut and told him &quot;Don't give them anything, but stall em along til I could get a GM involved and me there!&quot;<br>
The char who was trying to get the item was named Lollieeli, naked level 1 female human. I invised and sat where I could hear any says, while jumping the petition line. Guide Tulila got there almost as fast and was hiding in the wings as well.<br>
The guildmate was able to do a /report of Lolieeli claiming to be my alt, while I had Luithien pop'ed halfway around the world. Guide Tulila got the scammers PID and forwarded it and the reported text as well as her comments on to the GM. Since nothing had actually occurred she wasnt able to ban Lolieeli's account right there, but sent it to the Head GM.<br>
Lolieeli(Scammer_0189) still had no idea anything was going on and headed off to next potential victem with my alt in hot pursuit...<br>
this time she went to a Diligence member Vytautas. He had a bunch of cash on him and Lolieeli claimed to have the Mosquito Earring for sale! (this is the connection for the first scam) I sent potential_victim_01765 a fast tell to be VERY careful, he was dealing with a scammer!. Well Vytautas put his plat in a trade window, but when nothing was put in the otherside after a considerable amount of time he canceled the trade.<br>
He then started asking Lolieeli if she thought him stupid enough to hit trade with nothing in the window, and was she trying to rip him off?!<br>
I un-invised at this point and added to his comments. Welcome to &quot;BUSTED!&quot; Your PID is now known and a report on you been sent to head GM. Might as well cancel this account ya loser!<br>
Lolieeli stood there for about 30 seconds and then quickly went &quot;LD&quot; <br>
<br>
Please, PLEASE. If someone claims to be an alt of mine, or someone else you know, MAKE them pop the main. And NEVER give someone half of the deal, without getting your half RIGHT then. And make sure its the real item. I had a guy put a fungi in the window, claim to hit cancel by mistake, then put a small cloth shirt in the next time. Same icon but the value a bit lower ;-( <br>
Be safe out there, NPC's aint the most dangerous mobs in the game.<br>

I don't know about most of you but after 2 yrs of EQ I don't remember what credit card i used that far back. So far they have had no luck getting the account back. This just goes to show that there are a lot of worthless loosers out there, so be careful who you deal with. <p><b><table style=filter:glow(color=00FF7F strength=3 'lithograph' size='-1'><font color=Black face=verdana, ariel, helvetica, sans-serif>Methius Shadowwalker<BR> 57 Ranger<BR> Convergence</font></table></font><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=232957">my gear</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/uhyroshim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hyroshi M</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/8/02 4:53:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=179.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Scam alert!</span><hr size=1> She tried to get me on an RBG, was auctioninn WTB.

She never got back with me.<br>
I spend alot of time in EC buying and selling, its how i make meh money, and i have seen this trick and many other like it alot. Make sure you never ever give the cash or item first, if they want to do some sort of muling they will have to trust you. Just today Robcook tried it on me with a Mosquito leg earing, saw him wanting to sell i ask how much, he says 30k. Now i never pay what they ask lol even though this is a 80k earing i offered 25k. He accepted and i got the cash and meet him, stuck the money in trade 40 seconds later i get the, oh its on my main. Hand me the cash and ill brb. I of course said no and that id ay the toon with the earing, he loged and was never to be seen. <p>Hyroshi

Only the alt told me he was an old friend and fellow paladin.  I lost a Hiero...(think the actual rant is still on these boards).  At the same time I was jerked, so was Phelio--for a RBG.<br>
<br>
I would also suggest you write the head GM...address is on the sonyeq site...and do it within the day or so.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry your good name is being trashed, Luth.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with the ability to sell/buy accounts (as the person who scammed me does), he's not only got the gall to tell you he's someone you know--he has the ability to buy and sell accounts and keep going with a variety of idendities and keys.<br>

I was on when this was happening. I tried to get the person to ask the name of a long lost character you know of mine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I figured it be a pretty sure way to determine if it was you.<br>
Guess they didn't try or whatever, I never found out what happened in the end.  But you do have to watch out, there is those that will try anything to scam you.  With the unknown face behind the keys these losers have no guilt or conscience of what they do.  Be careful out there.<br>

If more people follow that rule, there will me far less scams.  Trade is a trade, you give, they give, and trade is complete.  Giving anyone anything in hopes of getting your item is asking for trouble.  Seen this happen too many times.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb I do not even deal with anyone unless they have cash or item on them, if they don't let them go have a friend do a transfer and come back when ready.<br>
