<br>
1: Guildmembers must be willing to at least loosely RP, and must advance the cause of the light.<br>
<br>
2: Any player interested in joining the Code of Honor must have a sponsor currently in the ranks of the guild to apply.  <br>
<br>
3: Before an application is approved, one must have his or her sponsorship approved by an officer other than the sponsors.<br>
<br>
4: Even a successful applicant cannot enter the guild until he or she has read and agreed to abide by the contents of this charter.<br>
<br>
5: Once an applicant has been approved, and invited, they will be on a probationary status for a month.  Durring this time, the officers will be paying close attention to them and will remove them if they feal it is in the best interest of the Code of Honor.<br>
<br>
Conduct: <br>
<br>
1: The way a member of the Code conducts him or herself reflects on the guild as a whole. <br>
<br>
2: Conduct yourself with honor while dealing with other characters. Don’t beg from those better off than yourself -- beggars demean themselves and insult the value of those they beg from -- and don’t ignore the guildless level 3 running around in patchwork. <br>
<br>
3: There must be no profanity over public channels. There’s a time and place, and it’s usually over private tells with people you know well. <br>
<br>
4: In PvP, it is even more important to conduct yourself with honor. People may forget how you conduct yourself in most things, but when you go to war with them, they will surely remember how you fought. <br>
<br>
5: Although it is fine to use almost any legal tactic in combat, NEVER, ever cause exp loss intentionally in PvP, or even risk it by attacking while your enemy is in combat with an NPC. Also, do not keep your victims unconscious in PvP. Both causing exp loss and keeping someone unconscious are OOC attacks, abuses of the system that only serve to ruin the game for the person on the other end of the character. <br>
<br>
6: Do not, with intent to kill or intimidate, attack those who are not your enemy and who do not consent to fight. The Code stands against this, and you will probably have to make things right or leave the guild. <br>
<br>
7: If you are killed in a battle, loot and scoot. Retrieve your corpse, and leave the zone quickly for one hour. There are only two exceptions to this is. The first is if you die in a group fight, but your team drives the other team out of the zone. You are allowed to re-enter the zone and hunt until forced out. The second is if you find that upon CR your opponent is no longer in zone. If this is the case, control is not an issue, and you may stay, unless he or she returns within the hour. <br>
<br>
8: If you kill someone else, don’t ever prevent them from getting their corpse and peacefully leaving. If they fail to retrieve the corpse or peacefully leave, however, feel free to kill them until they do (giving them a chance to leave every time). Petitioning immediately is a good idea as well, since SOMETIMES a GM will respond and remove the offending char.<br>
<br>
9: Treat all characters with the respect that the person behind the character is due, except for the PKs and crossteamers (definitions below). They suck. Remember your honor, though, and do not sacrifice it on their behalf.<br>
<br>
10: Follow the rules set out by Verant Interactive, where the Code does not already have policy. Exploiters and those guilty of OOC abusive behaviour are black marks upon their guilds. <br>
<br>
<br>
Enemies: <br>
<br>
1: The Code stands against all who oppose the cause of the Light. <br>
<br>
2: Members must never assist, group with, or accept help from a character from a dark race, a PK (a character who PKs purely for fun or profit), or a character in a light guild that admits dark races (light guilds with dark race members are crossteamers) or PKs. The allies/enemies list will identify those guilds that fall under this category.<br>
<br>
3: Any PK or dark character is fair game in PvP, as they are enemies of the light and deserve death. <br>
<br>
4: PvP status with light members of guilds that admit some PKs and darks is at the discretion of the officers. For more information, consult the allies/enemies list. <br>
<br>
5: Despite what is said above, one must remember that darks are players as well. Many are good people OOC, and because of this there are some exceptions to the no-assist rule. If there is a truly valid, OOC reason for assisting a dark (said dark was XP PKed by several training Prophets or something and needs an exp res), or being assisted by a dark, then it is acceptable at the member’s discretion -- please notify an officer, as soon as possible, though. If an officer finds out from somebody else, you will likely be having a long talk with a cranky, smelly barbarian. <br>
<br>
6: A member of CoH may accept help from one of the dark races if imminent disaster, caused by bug or exploit, can not otherwise be avoided. An example of such a situation would include, but is not limited to, the potential permanent loss of corpse. A member of CoH may also share information with a member of the dark races, so long as such information does not harm members of the light team. This sharing of information should be done by means of tells or the OOC channel. The exception above does NOT allow you to get darks to mez guards to make it easier for to get a piece of Soulfire, or overcome other normal game obstacles more easily. <br>
<br>
7: A member of Code of Honor may buy, sell or trade with an enemy so long as such transactions are kept private, discreet and OOC. <br>
<br>
<br>
Enforcement: <br>
<br>
1: If a member fails to live up to the ideals of the Code in some way, other members may make a complaint to the officers. The officers can then choose to take action if and as they see fit. Any decision made will be based on the consensus among the officers.<br>
<br>
2: If the member in question is an officer, he or she does not get to contribute to the consensus. Other members should make the complaint to the guildleader or another officer in this case.<br>
<br>
3: If a member is in some way acting in a manner forbidden by the guild, and fails to cease the activity in question when told to by an officer, any officer has the authority to remove the offending player immediately. <br>
