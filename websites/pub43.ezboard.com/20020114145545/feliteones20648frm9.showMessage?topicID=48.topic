<br>
THE OVERTHROW OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC, Part One <br>
by Sherman H. Skolnick 09/22/01<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Starting after the multiple bombings of the Federal office building in Oklahoma City, April 19, 1995, I wrote and then spoke on talk radio about an aborted military coup. Brought home to me, however, was the reality that my fellow Americans had little knowledge or understanding of the masterstroke, the overthrow of government, whether for the good or for evil. <br>
<br>
In the past, had we as Americans been clearly informed by the popular press of a putsch, the overthrow of government by violence, by political assassination, such as to benefit domestic or foreign powers? After all, who benefitted from the political assassination of President Abraham Lincoln if not the British and the French who held the means to swoop upon us at the time from their entrenched positions to the south and north of us, in Canada and Mexico. The British wanted to split apart the nation by aggravating the natural friction between the ideas of the North and the South in America. The French were ready to carve up America as well. Since at least the War of 1812, the British had plotted to take back this continent as a puppet colony with so-called &quot;Americans&quot; again as subjects of the British Crown. [To their credit, Czarist Russia at the time of the War Between The States, or as called, the American Civil War, attempted to aid Lincoln with the Czar's naval fleet coming right offshore the U.S.] <br>
<br>
Look what happened in the decades after the murder of Lincoln. President James Garfield was against the British controlling the growing financial power of the U.S. President William McKinley [the Brits hate the Irish] opposed the British trying to strangle the rise of American industrial power. Their political assassination in the years after that of Lincoln, in its simplest explanation, benefitted British attempts to grab back America. <br>
<br>
Seldom, if ever, are these events explained in this way. <br>
<br>
The Clinton White House with prior knowledge, allowed the Oklahoma bombings to occur, to restore his power following the debacle of the 1994 Congressional elections putting a GOP majority to confront him in Congress. And, with Clinton as a marionette, it aided the Establishment in their continuing propaganda to make common Americans helpless to oppose tyranny by disarming them. <br>
<br>
Two days before the Oklahoma bloodshed, on April 17, 1995, a plane-load of top military brass were murdered when their sabotaged plane blew up near Alexander City, Alabama. It was a real life version of &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;. According to federal grand jurors we interviewed, there was an attempt, later blocked, by a grand jury to investigate this aborted coup. It was actually part of a series of events involving twenty four Admirals and Generals, some of the most patriotic flag officers in the history of this Republic. They vowed, under the Uniform Military Code, to arrest their Commander-in-Chief Bill Clinton, for his various acts of treason aiding and abetting sworn enemies of the United States, such as Red China and Iraq. If Clinton had them arrested for mutiny, they were prepared, if not assassinated, to defend themselves with their heavily documented charges of his treachery against the U.S. Constitution and the people of the United States. <br>
<br>
Some of the coup plotters, deciding to be out of uniform, took up residence in a Paris suburb. The French CIA, aware of all this, used it to blackmail advantages out of the U.S. government. Such as, to blockade the U.S. Justice Department, itself a highly corrupt entity, from prosecuting some fourteen French nationals, resident in the U.S., who stole U.S. industrial and financial secrets. [The French used similar blackmail threatening to publicize their knowledge of Iran's complicity in the missile attack on TWA Flight 800. Eight top officials of the French CIA along with some 60 other French nationals died in the plane that had been scheduled for Paris. A top official, however, of the French CIA at the last minute refused to board Flight 800. The Clinton White House had a secret business/peace deal pending with the Teheran oligarchs which the missile disclosures would have wrecked.] <br>
<br>
The purpose of several attempts to pull off a coup was NOT to install a junta [pronounced HOON-tah], that is, an evil military dictatorship. Rather, to restore by necessary force the American Republic, which has gone down hill since the overthrow, by the American secret political police, of the U.S. government, by way of the murder in 1963 of President John F. Kennedy. <br>
<br>
In the months and years that followed the Alexander City incident, some ten like-minded Admirals, Generals, and other officials and former officials, were assassinated. Such as, Admiral Jeremy Boorda, Chief of Naval Operations, the highest naval officer in uniform. Such as General David McCloud, head of the Alaska Military District. Such as, former Director of Central Intelligence, DCI, William Colby. Our interviews with their family members, relatives, and confidants convinces us of the validity of our reports. The monopoly press wrote off their demise as &quot;airplane accidents&quot;, &quot;suicide&quot;, and &quot;boat accident&quot;. <br>
<br>
Some of those hearing me on the radio, wrote to me. I could see rightaway, they had no understanding of the subject. One letter stated simply, &quot;Mr. Skolnick, send me your papers on the koo [sic].&quot; Evidently, this subject is not in the usual U.S. history text books in the usual high schools and colleges. <br>
<br>
[As to the Iraqi connection, visit our website stories. Such as &quot;U.S. Government Prior Knowledge of Emergency&quot;, &quot;The Secrets of Timothy McVeigh&quot;.] <br>
<br>
Because of my analyses of the current emergency, I should, I suppose, expect to be heckled and reviled by some well-meaning but poorly informed fellow Americans. Notwithstanding the pronouncements of the American secret political police, the FBI and CIA, and the oil-soaked, spy-riddled monopoly press, and the White House, the plot to destroy the American republic is entirely based WITHIN THIS NATION. <br>
<br>
It is obviously good and proper to respect the U.S. flag, perpetuated with the blood of American heroes. On the other hand, it can be a fatal mistake, a nuking of the Bill of Rights, not to recognize scoundrels who wrap themselves in the same flag to cover up their crimes against the American common people. <br>
<br>
In its simplest form, the Persian Gulf War was just the falling out of former private business partners. I was the only journalist to be in attendance in 1991, at the hearing of a federal court case in Chicago. My exclusive interviews of the participants confirmed why certain bank records had to be concealed, the subject matter of the litigation. They showed the secret private business partnership in the 1980s of George Herbert Walker Bush, President in 1991, and Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi strongman installed by Bush, starting when Bush was head of the secret police in 1976. [My exclusive highly detailed story ran in a populist newspaper, &quot;Spotlight&quot;, August 19, 1991.] <br>
<br>
Profoundly corrupt Chicago federal appeals judges put the case out of court and the file has been scattered to the wind. We apparently are the only ones still having the court file. [Visit our website story, &quot;The Secrets of Timothy McVeigh&quot;, for the name and number of the case and details of the judges.] <br>
<br>
The Elder Bush during the Gulf War, wanted the American public to falsely believe that putting the head of Saddam Hussein on a platter and delivering it to the White House, would cure every domestic and foreign problem of the U.S. On July 17, 1993, Saddam Hussein murdered some ten of his top military officers who were plotting, he said, to overthrow him. The Clinton White House, with Bill Clinton as a Bush Family crony, had apparently committed treachery in leaking CIA details to Saddam of the plot against him. Working on investigating both Clinton and Bush as to this treasonous leak, was FBI Director William Sessions who was unceremoniously sacked on frivolous charges two days later, all to protect the treachery from being disclosed of Bush/Clinton. The very next day, Vincent W. Foster, Jr., Clinton White House Deputy Counsel, who also knew what had happened, was assassinated and clumsily disguised as a &quot;suicide&quot;. The aborted plot against Saddam did not become even a watered down version of what happened, in the U.S. monopoly press, until November 1, 1993. [See, &quot;U.S. Accused of Betraying Plot To Kill Iraq's Hussein&quot;, Chicago Tribune, 11/1/93.] <br>
<br>
In 1991, the Elder Bush, as President, put some half a million Americans in harm's way, by way of Bush instigating a fight over Gulf oil properties with his former business partner, Saddam Hussein. Together, in the 1980s, as known to the participants in the lawsuit mentioned, Saddam and Bush, as business partners, split billions of dollars extorted from the oil-soaked weak sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf. The same as done by gangsters who would extract &quot;protection money&quot; from shopkeepers and tax-cheating auto dealers. <br>
<br>
As a sizeable stockholder of a unit of a French firm, American LaFarge, the Elder Bush was implicated in reportedly supplying the ingredients for poison gas to be manufactured by Iraq, to be used against Iraq's domestic dissidents, namely, the Kurds, as well as against the Iranians, during the Iran-Iraq War, 1980 to 1988. A Director of American LaFarge, naturally, was Hillary Rodham Clinton, wife of the Bush Family pal. <br>
<br>
Ten years after 1991, the Elder Bush's son, as &quot;resident&quot; and &quot;occupant&quot; of the White House, installed under highly suspect means, is going to war AGAINST HIS reputed former business partner, Osama bin Laden. Like father, like son. George W. Bush's business partner has been a Houston, Texas businessman, James R. Bath. Together, they owned an oil drilling company, Arbusto Energy. [The son, like his father, likes to name his businesses with Spanish names. The Elder Bush named his firm Zapata Petroleum, later, Zapata Offshore, with 600 units worldwide as outposts for the American CIA, starting as early as 1959. The younger Bush's Arbusto is Spanish for &quot;Bush&quot;.] <br>
<br>
By and through James R. Bath, George W. Bush has been a business partner, in the tens of millions of dollars, with Osama bin Laden and his father. As an example, Bath had many millions of dollars of dealings with the Elder bin Laden who was part of the infamous spy/assassination/money laundry scandal of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, BCCI. See the details in &quot;The Outlaw Bank---A Wild Ride Into The Secret Heart of BCCI&quot;, by Jonathan Beaty and S.C. Gwynne, Random House, New York, 1993, pages 227-230. <br>
<br>
Notice in our prior story about the Emergency, the details of Osama bin Laden's secret joint accounts (stemming from the George W. Bush/James R. Bath/bin Laden business partnerships) in the Harris Bank, a unit of Bank of Montreal, owned largely by the Bronfman Family, who have been the owners of the Seagrams booze cartel, and another major owner of the bank being U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald (R., Ill.). The U.S. units of Barclays Bank, United Kingdom, have also sought to conceal such reputed joint accounts of Osama bin Laden/James R. Bath/George W. Bush. Who can believe the White House when they say they would freeze Osama bin Laden's accounts if they can find them? Also please notice, in my exclusive story about the Elder Bush/Saddam Hussein business partnership, the banks involved were Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, BNL, owned in part by the Vatican, and its bank twin, BCCI. [My exclusive story in &quot;Spotlight&quot;, 8/19/91.] <br>
<br>
So, father and son, ten years apart, George Herbert Walker Bush amd George W. Bush, went to war or are going to war against their former business partners. Throughout history, regimes have created an &quot;enemy&quot;, as a straw man, and then sent their armies to fight their &quot;enemy&quot;. This by way of consolidating their power and diverting attention from their domestic problems, and repressing the poorly informed populace. <br>
<br>
&gt;From the sarcastic standpoint of those who rule us WITHOUT OUR CONSENT, in violation of the U.S. Constitution, America is becoming too populated for there to be supposedly guaranteed rights. Remember, the Bill of Rights is heavily packed with the word NO. It is a shield against a tyrannical central government. At the hands, however, of a corrupt and venal federal judiciary and a treasonous central government, and a bought off and blackmailed Congress, the Bill of Rights is a worthless, useless piece of paper. The cowardly mass media are mere scriveners, writing down what they are dictated. <br>
<br>
Under the disguise of leading a religious &quot;crusade&quot; against the Moslem world, every utterance dripping with the word &quot;terrorist&quot;, are the ruling elites in the process of overthrowing the American Republic? <br>
<br>
Who all benefitted from treasonous prior knowledge of the violence against America on September 11, 2001? Are some flag officers in the U.S. military, with full knowledge of all this, opposed to going to a war instigated by the highest circles WITHIN THE UNITED STATES? <br>
<br>
More coming. Stay tuned. <br>

Couple questions.<br>
&lt;controlling the fits of laughter&gt;<br>
1.  Do you believe this stuff?<br>
if yes.<br>
2. That means that the Republican &quot;God&quot; Reagan was in on this too?  Since he has held the office of President since Kennedy's assassination.  Hmmmmm<br>
3. Do you expect reasoning, rational americans to believe this as well?  Although I don't normally have much confidence in the intelligence of the American Public as a whole, I think they have a tad more than to believe something as outrageous as this.<br>
<br>
I have doubts as to the business relations between the Bushs' and the other parties in question.  But even if it is so, did we not arm Iraq during it's wars with Iran?  Did we not arm Afganistan during its wars with the Soviet Union.  Anytime we give guns to another country it has the possibility to come back to haunt us.<br>
<br>
As for the slander against our European allies.  I'll not dispute the history, that they had interest in our civil war and the war of 1812, etc... of course they did.  How long ago was that though.  How close are these nations to us now?  These countries are smart enough to know that they would only suffer if the U.S. were to somehow fall or fail.  As would the entire world.  And that is what the terrorists want.  The world to suffer.  Because that is when they can seize the greatest amount of power and wealth.    It has nothing to do with religion, though they may call it a holy war (Gihad).<br>
<br>
I'm Sorry Rheaton, but I am going to have to disagree with the majority of the above posted conspiracy theory.<br>
<br>

Reading much of what this person has posted on his site i have concluded that..<br>
<br>
1.) He is paranoid about the government. What drives this i haven't a clue...but history teaches that every person who speaks up against the gov. or acts against them feels that in someway they have been wronged by the government.<br>
<br>
2.) Although the above article is very &quot;shoot from the hip&quot;, hit and miss rambling, i found many of his other articles giving the appearance of a well thought through and well organized in partial detail.<br>
<br>
3.) If he is 50% wrong or even 75% wrong, it still shows motive on behalf of the gov. and other parties involved.<br>
<br>
<br>
What boggles me the most is... how does someone get this much &quot;sensitive&quot; information?  Do i dare ask?<br>
In one of his articles he makes a valid point. Our American press will not hesitate to report corruption in other parts of the world... but rarely reports near the magnitude of what happens here....as if there isn't any. Say what you want, but there is an abundance of corruption at every level of our government. The nice thing is that we have the power to vote out the corrupt ones and roll the dice on new ones...if we know for sure who they are.<br>
<br>
No.. im not a sucker for every &quot;anti-government conspiracy theory&quot; that comes along... but i also don't believe everything the &quot;almighty&quot; government tells me...or the press for that matter.<br>
