I am prolly one of the few Americans among us today that, at age 29, has some &quot;very old fashion beliefs&quot;  The Boss' quote.<br>
<br>
I don't know where in the world i obtained these &quot;old fashion&quot; convictions...but i did. I am a patriot to the heart. I shudder at &quot;globalization&quot;. I strongly believe that America is a very bright light in a very dark world and her principles and foundation need not to be compromised to appease the &quot;unifying&quot; popular thought.<br>
  I was raised in Oklahoma by what many would smirkingly call &quot;good ol folk&quot;. I was brought up being taught there is a God and only one true God. This was instilled in me from my earliest days and has followed me to the present day. I like many people begun to question God's existence but ALL doubts were laid to rest when he touched my heart, my life, my mind, and my world.<br>
  I my younger years, my rebel teenage years, I would hear many speak of God, hellfire and damnation. I would also hear so many tell me that &quot;You will never truly know until you experience Him for yourself.&quot; ... I didn't really have a clue as to what they were talking about until i did experience Him.<br>
  I was educated in public schools. We, every morning, would stand and say the pledge of allegiance... and yes, even say the worlds which are now condemned  &quot;..one nation, under God...&quot;. I often wondered at why there were so many references to God in the government. &quot;In God we trust&quot;, &quot;..and may God bless America&quot;, &quot;..one nation under God&quot;...what ever happened to that? I know it is still on money, and even the President will say it from time to time... but where has God gone in our society?<br>
  I seriously believe that we Americans have come dangerously close to the fire and we don't know it. We have itemized God as an offensive historical ideology. We are now far too enlightened..or rather  too big for our breaches. <br>
 God, in many parts of our society, has become more offensive then homosexuality and abortion. Why? Why is it that the Bible, which speaks only love and peace, has become so forbidden in our public lives? Perhaps its because it speaks against so many of our assorted lifestyles?<br>
  In todays history books regarding the foundation of our country, so much has been omitted. How about the documentation of where the entire congress would erupt into song and praise to God. There is a deep rooted religious history in this country and it was well thought through in this countrys beginning.<br>
  I have included below a few quotes from our founding fathers and also the link from where they were taken. I challenge everyone to take a day or two to read through them and make comments in regards.<br>
<br>
&quot;The clergy...believe that any portion of power confided to me [as President] will be exerted in opposition to their schemes. And they believe rightly: for I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. But this is all they have to fear from me: and enough, too, in their opinion.&quot; --Thomas Jefferson to Benjamin Rush, 1800<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;In every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot ... they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon, unintelligible to all mankind, and therefore the safer engine for their purpose.&quot; --- Thomas Jefferson, to Horatio Spafford, March 17, 1814 <br>

For now though I will leave it at this:  I know the country was founded on these religious beliefs.  And that for the most part these beliefs are good.  They are bastardized and abused and forced on people as if they aret he only way to be good people.  <br>
<br>
Frankly, that is the main problem I have with most religions.  If God exists, why must I worship him the way a specific church tells me to?  Why must I be religious to have morals?  We know that latter is not true, but it is how I am often treated when I confront people about their religious beliefs.  As if I am a bad person because I don't worship a book, a man who may or may not have lived 2000+ years ago, or a god in general.<br>
<br>
Why is it necessary to force religion on people to make society better?  Why not focus on their actions?  Make them better people instead of making them mindless followers?  I know that is a bit harsh.  Only my opinions.<br>

You have hit the nail on the head. That is exacly what they did not want to happen....religous tyranny. To be forced to worship a certain way, in a certain place and on a certain day.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish it (Christianity) were more productive of good works ... I mean real good works ... not holy-day keeping, sermon-hearing ... or making long prayers, filled with flatteries and compliments despised by wise men, and much less capable of pleasing the Deity.&quot;--- Benjamin Franklin, Works, Vol. VII, p. 75 <br>
<br>
&quot;Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear.&quot; --- Thomas Jefferson, letter to Peter Carr, Aug. 10, 1787 <br>
<br>
Ol TJ was a mastermind and he and many others established &quot;freedom of religion&quot; not only to protect peoples religion but to protect the men and women in this nation from imposed or forceful religion...im mah opinion. <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font

But will being religious and sitting on your hands doing nothing? How much of an obligation to we have to our religions?<br>
  Religion is man made, God is not. Zort, your earlier statement about using the bible as a way to govern a nation...&quot;HORRIBLE!&quot; .. was a bit harsh but i must agree. I do not think it was set up or designed to be a direct instuction document on how to govern a nation, but moreso an instruction manual of how to live in general.<br>
   All religions come with instructions. The bible has direct instructions from Jesus himself and direct instructions from God himself. How do we interpurt these instuctions? &quot;Thou shall not kill.&quot;  Thats pretty easy to observe along with the other 9 comandments. But what about The Golden Rule? Obviously you have to be in a good place in your heart to observe this one.<br>
   So many people have been turned away or turned off of religion cause of the imposed 'rules'. &quot;Now that your saved you must go home and get rid of your TV set, stop listening to music (other then gospel), change the way you dress, and pray every night and day&quot;. I think praying is very good...but you need to have something in your heart to pray about first...dont ya? These rules are not the spirit of God.. you do these things on your own, by choise, cause you want to for God. <br>
  &quot;Stop listening to the devil's music or your going to hell&quot;. If you heart hasnt changed are your not saved and do turn off the music, your still going to hell. It is when saved (Christain religion), that your eyes open and you see the &quot;devil's music&quot; for its true nature on your own and without instructions is what makes you want to turn it off...again.. a personal choise, not a imposed rule.<br>
   &quot;Thou shall not kill&quot; is plan and simple. It doesnt say what not to kill or give any justifications for killing...just plan and simple &quot;Thou shall not kill&quot;. But the bible says &quot;Suffer not a witch to live&quot; so many 'expected' witches were burned at the stake. Again, its a condition of the heart vs. blindly following. Then the bible goes on to say &quot;theres a time to kill and a time to heal..&quot; (forgive me if i mis-quote) and &quot;a time of war and a time of peace&quot;. Well obviously you kill people in wars. Were the latter amendments to the comandments cause God knew we would kill or a conditioning of the heart so we wouldnt kill anymore?<br>
   So much of the bible must be read and seen through spiritual eyes cause the carnal, worldly knowledge of man just flat out can not conceive it and its spiritual meaning....and the spirt is what drives and directs our lives.<br>
<br>
So in short, the bible is not a constitution for our flesh to be governed, but a constitution of sorts for our spirit to obey and follow. <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font
