<br>
I know that there will be some Errors and gaps [specificaly on the 9th and 10th Ring], However due to the protracted steps to go from the first to last ring I wanted to post this so that those that wish to can begin this quest. <br>
<br>
The other night a few of us where watching / helping during the 10th ring battle…. Talk about a war… waves and waves of giants assaulting the dwarfs and your PC groups [40 player + all 50+ level] outside TG. I have even read some posts about the person doing the quest to get a dwarf scout &quot;pet&quot; to help guild and control things during the war.<br>
<br>
<br>
There was a few posts also about essentially doing this quest twice and having 2 rings that are of different level…. For example having the 7th and 8th Ring would get you AC 15, Str 15, MR 15 and the DS effect…..hummmm<br>
<br>
General Information:<br>
Start In  All Quests Start In the Eastren Wastes Zone with Garadain Glacierbane [Level 42], found at a Coldain camp at roughly -2600, -300.<br>
<br>
Copper Ring  -   Quest:   Garadain's Blanket<br>
<br>
Estimated Time:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2 hours&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Minimum Level:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 30&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Garadain Glacierbane wants you to make him a blanket to keep him warm. Combine wo high quality tundra kodiak hides and two high quality snow cougar pelts in a large sewing kit to make the blanket. The item was trivial at skill 82. Turning this in will get you a Copper Coldain Insignia Ring and the following factions: Coldain better, DainFrostreaverIV better, Kromzek worse, Kromrif worse, and some xp.<br>

Alt. Notes:<br>
if u wanna raise ur skill fast buy a large sewing kit and a backpack full of patterns and take an empty backpack or too. <br>
next go to EK kill spiders cats and keep makin silk swatches and tattered armour, silk armour till u run out of patterns this should easily get you to around 40 skill hopefully and if ur doing this questyou should be able to hunt EK <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Silver Ring  -  Quest:  Garadain's Axe<br>
<br>
Estimated Time:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2 hours&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Minimum Level:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 45&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
You must first do the Garadain's Blanket quest to get your copper ring. After that, Garadain asks you to take the axe he gives you to his nephew Boridain, and bring back proof that he is ok, along with your Copper ring. This requires going to coordinates -2446, 1544 and giving Boridain the Axe. At this point, he will start trying to find his Rabid Kodiak. Which means he wanders around and gets in trouble. You must keep him from dying. I highly suggest a minimum of two people for this, so one can fight and the other can keep following Boridain. Some of the mobs we had to fight were blue to a 52, btw. Eventually, a Rabid Kodiak will spawn. Kill it, loot the rabid pelt, and give to Boridain. You don't have much time, as he will despawn in a minute or two after the kodiak is dead. He will give you back a Broken Axe. Take this Broken Axe (this is your &quot;proof&quot; for Garadain) and your Copper ring back to Garadain to recieve a Silver ring. There was xp but no faction for completing this quest.<br>

ALT From Notes:<br>
Easiest way to do it is harmony everything, harmony all mobs, and harmony Baradain too. I did this and the only thing I had to fight was the rabid kodiak at the end. If you have two people to harmony it's as easy as pie. I did it solo. I used panick animal on the kodiak every 12 seconds and it was an easy fight (just like any panick animal fight) <br>
<br>
After you give the quest dwarf the axe, he heads immediately to the front gates of the giant fort. You will need to kill/kite away the two guards there. Next he heads to the Ruined Houses with Ry'Gorr and Giant Guards, straight for the little corral holding one giant and Ry'gorr. Lastly he heads for the Ry'gorr fort, before heading back to his beginning point. When he reaches his starting point that is when the Rabid Kodiak spawns. You must kill the Kodiak quickly as the dwarf does despawn pretty quick. Fear not though, just wait until the dwarf respawn at his starting point (this might be an hour or two) and give him a new axe and then immediately had him the rabid pelt you looted off the Kodiak. He will give you the broken axe then and continue on his merry way once more. <br>
The dwarf does not seem to aggro rhinos or griffens, wolves. He will immediately attack any giant or orc in his path. So plan accordingly. HE also take several little rests stops, these are great little heal and mana breaks. <br>
Boradain is a complete fool, and the axe that you give him is like dmg 3 dly 50 or something silly like that. He heads straight for the giants and dies in a few hits, so I've tried to train the giants away to the coldain camps so they would kill them. Works OK, but every time I've cleared them, someone has come along and killed Boridain or triggered the quest before I could get the field cleared. I would like to try this with a monk that (SoW'd) could run the giants to the other side of the zone and FD, or for that matter someone could train them to a zone entrance while our silly dwarf friend roams around getting himself into trouble.<br>

Gold Ring  -  Quest:  Garadain's Knife<br>
<br>
Estimated Time: <br>
Minimum Level: 30&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
This is the third quest in the Garadain series. This time, he wants you to make him a nice knife. You need a flawless walrus hide, a wooly rhino tusk, and a skinning rock. The walrus hide is actually a high quality walrus hide, and the tusk is a horn. These can be found on the appropriate mobs. The hard part is the skinning rock, which spawns randomly on the ground. Once you have all three items, combine them in a forge to make Garadain's new knife. (Trivial at 65) Once you have the knife made, take it and your Silver ring back to Garadain for the gold ring. He then gives you the quest for the platinum ring, the details of which are still unclear.<br>

Alt Notes:<br>
go to thurg, buy about 60 water and 120 small chunks of ore. Go to forge place 1 ore 1 ore 1 water combine. Do this till 21 skill &quot;SAVE YOUR METAL BITS&quot; then place 1 metal bit 1 water hit combine till your at 40 skill(you can continue if you want it up higher) with the 40 skill place HQ walraus skin/pelt, rhino tusk/horn, and shiny stone hit combine. This should take about 30 mins to 45 mins to get that high also only about 15 to 20pp.<br>
<br>
I just forged the knife w/ my druid ... gonna be handing it over to my monk now. <br>
<br>
Note that the new skinning knife is tradeable. So if you can have a friend with a high smithing skill collect the items. <br>

Platinum Ring  -  Quest:  Garadain's Smithed Knife<br>
<br>
Estimated Time:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Minimum Level:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 50<br>
This is the fourth Garadain Quest. He wants you to get him a hammer to smith the knife you just got for him. He gives you a note to give to Tain Frostbite, however, you really want to give it to Tain Hammerfrost. <br>
<br>
If you head straight out from the dragon bone bridge in the eastern wastes...you will very soon (after the first hill) come to a small dwarven cleric named Tain. <br>
<br>
Giving him the note does not do much, but if you hail him, he'll mention that he was ambushed by frost giants and he desperately needs [help]. <br>
<br>
If you say &quot;I will help you&quot; he sits down (I think he actually despawns and despawns immediately, which may be important) and says &quot;they will be here soon! Kill Grhek and give me his vial&quot;. <br>
<br>
4 Frost giants, and one named giant....spawn not too far and run up to kill the dwarf. They are all blue to a 56 <br>
<br>
If you can kill the named Giant, you can loot a blue vial ALL/ALL no stats. (it had a name..for the life of me I don't recall it...). Tradeable. <br>
<br>
If the dwarf despawns and respawns before you can give him the vial, you get nothing. If you give the vial to him before he despawns (or perhaps after triggering him again) he gives you a Coldain Smithing Hammer, a no drop lore item with no stats. Take that back to Garadain along with your gold ring and he will give you the platinum ring.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

Alt Notes:<br>
Here is what I did, since there was only two of us. I harmonied the named giant then pulled him, then killed him and looted the elixir. Now the other giants will kill off Tain, but wait an hour and he will repop. When Tain REPOPS DO NOT give him the elixir. Say &quot; what help&quot; wait for him to sit down and respawn, he will cast a spell. Then give him the elixir and you will get the Coldain smithing hammer.<br>
<br>
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Obsidian  Ring  -  Quest: Garadain's Intercept Quest<br>
<br>
Estimated Time:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Minimum Level:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 47<br>
This is the 5th Garadain Quest. Garadain asks you to go intercept a rygorr messenger who is carrying invasion plans. Garadain instructs you to give the invasion plans to a coldain lookout in his camp. He also tells you to intercept the invasion force and kill the leader, an orc named Scarbrow. When you give the lookout the plans, a veritable horde <br>
of orcs attacks Garadain's outpost. Scarbrow leads a force of 2-3 rygorr invaders (lvl 42-44) and 2-3 rygorr oracles. (lvl 42-44) <br>
<br>
Without your assistance the orcs will probably wipe out the dwarves, however this isn't good because the dwarves can outdamage you, and thus cause Scarbrow's corpse to poof when you do finally kill him. <br>
<br>
The trick is this: The orcs spawn about 100 yards from the camp. You must intercept Scarbrow before the dwarves agro. You can let the dwarves kill the other invaders, and I highly suggest it, because 7 43+ mobs are a pain. Scarbrow himself is about 47th level and is a shadow knight. Anyway, get Scarbrow away from the action and kill him there while one person kites the other orcs. There is some risk here in that the oracles may sow themselves and they can do some real damage with spells if you try to kite them. But doing it this way only required 3 people, whereas killing all 7 toe-to-toe would probably require 2 groups, even if you had an enchanter. <br>
<br>
Scarbrow dropa his head. Giving his head and your platinum ring to Garadain results in the Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

<br>
Mithril Ring  -  Quest:  Garadain's Proof<br>
<br>
Estimated Time:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Minimum Level:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 47<br>
This is the sixth Coldain quest. Garadain wants you to find out what happened to the coldain invasion force that tried to attack the giants a while back. No evidence has ever been found of their demise. Garadain wants 2 things, proof of their demise, and proof of the demise of their killers. <br>
<br>
For the proof of the demise of the Coldain, Korrigan the undead coldain is the NPC you want to talk to. He spawns at night at the dwarven hut near Icefang, the named dire wolf. Talking to the undead coldain reveals that the coldain elite forces were the victims of a very nasty trick by the rygorr. Before the coldain could mount their attack on the giants, Rygorr shaman charmed the coldain's wolves and turned them on their masters. During the conversation with Korrigan, Icefang respawns as an agro high level version of himself and attacks you. <br>
<br>
Stay out of range of Icefang, and he will eventually run over to the orc hut near the bridge. When he gets there, 4 oracles or ry'gorr will spawn along with Poxbreath Yellowfang, a named rygorr. Kill Yellowfang to get a Note from Kromrif. (no drop) The note outlines Rodrick the coldain traitor's assistance in killing the elite coldain. <br>
<br>
Near Rygorr keep is the exit of crystal caverns. Every once in a while a Rygorr Emissary will spawn there. If you wait a few minutes and don't kill him, Rodrick will spawn next to him. He is a traitor to the coldain. Kill him to get his Head (no drop). <br>
<br>
Turn the head, the note and your obsidian ring in to Garadain Glacierbane for your mithril insignia ring.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

Rodrick is completely MR so don't bother trying to snare kite him<br>
<br>
Ok, here is some info for you, that it doesn't say. When you hail the ghost, you have to show him your ring, he then goes on giving more info..and then Icefang comes out and starts running..as long as your not KoS to coldain, Icefang won't attack you ,  follow icefang,…...oh, the Emissary, keep him alive at all cost<br>
<br>
No, you hand him your coldain insignia ring from the 5th quest and he will tell you the story and the wolf will respawn and go to the ry'gorr camp. He immediately gives it back to you after you give it to him, then starts to talk. <br>
<br>
<br>

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>
Adamantium Ring  -  Quest:  Garadain's Rescue Quest<br>
<br>
Estimated Time:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Minimum Level:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 50<br>
This is the 7th Garadain Quest. <br>
<br>
Garadain asks you to rescue Corbin Blackwell. Kill Warden Bruke for his Shackle Key (no drop) and then give both the key and your mithril insignia ring to Corbin Blackwell. He will make his escape. (And give back the ring). You must protect Corbin until he reaches Dobbin Crossaxe. <br>
<br>
Along the way 4 rygorr and 4 giants including Commander Bahreck, a named giant, will attack Corbin. You must keep him alive. Once he reaches Dobbin, Dobbin will thank you for rescuing him and tell you that he will give you a note for Garadain if you show him your mithril insignia ring. <br>
<br>
Giving Dobbin the ring results in a note. Give this note back to Garadain and he will reward you with the adamantium ring and the final quest.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Well, I just completed this step of the ring quest solo and it was astoundingly simple. <br>
<br>
When you take down Warden Bruke three giants spawn around the front of his hut as soon as you attack him. So don't attack him while standing at the front of the hut! Instead, target him and run around the back of the hut and cast something on him. The giants will spawn around the front, he'll run out the back and will not agro any of them.[ go up the hill to the left and pull him.. he will come and the 4 giants will not] Result: 1 key. <br>
<br>
Clear out the Kromrif Prison Guards, the RyGor Prison Guards and the Interrogator of RyGor to get to Corbin. Hand him the key and follow him. He'll walk a little way and will shout soemthign like &quot;They are upon us&quot; when the 4 orc, 4 giants and the commander spawns. IMMEDIATELY attack Corbin to agro him and run him towards the ocean. The giants and orcs will be too far away to agro and Corbin will come hairing after you. Run him back a bit towards the prison then double back and run to Dobbin leaving him behind and camp to clear agro. When you log back in, if you have done it correctly, Corbin should have regained his senses and will be wandering towards Dobbin. Wait until Corbin despawns and Dobbin asks you for your ring. Et voila! Quest completed. <br>
<br>
One word of warning though, the giants and orcs you just spawned will not just vanish. They start to head towards the Rygor fort front entrance. I was not aware of this when I did the quest. Neither were the poor saps camping the fort. Two groups of peeps in the forties were annihilated by the returning giants and orcs. Sorry lads. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Velium Ring  -  Quest:   Garadain's War<br>
<br>
Estimated Time:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Minimum Level:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 55<br>
It is an all out war against Chief Ry'Gorr and his troops. <br>
<br>
Garadain says 'Very Well, Kaladur , give me the Adamantite ring and I will give you the marching orders. Once the orders are given to Gloradin in the next hut, we will be underway. You then must follow me to what will be our battleground. I must warn you, I will hold your ring until the head of Chief Ry'Gorr is given to me. If we fail, all will <br>
be lost... for both of us. <br>
<br>
As you can see, the 8th quest is tough. You only get ONE chance to do it right. Once you give Garadain your ring, you must kill Chief Ry'Gorr, loot his head, and give the head to Garadain. Ry'gorr only has a head during this event. I am unsure if you can do the quest if Garadain dies. Most likely, if he dies during this event you won't be able to complete the quest. You only get one shot at this, because you lose the ring. <br>
<br>
This battle involves 30+ rygorr, including some low 50's. This probably requires a well-tuned team of 55-60th level snare kiters, or alternatively a full 30+ PC army. <br>
<br>
The reward is the Velium Coldain Insignia Ring. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Alt Notes:<br>
When I was completing the eighth quest, here's what I did: <br>
<br>
I had two groups of people inside the courtyard, to include a 60 MNK and 55 DRU. They cleared the few mobs in the courtyard. Myself and my druid wife were outside and I turned in my 7th ring to Garadain. Garadain gave me orders to give to the female cleric in the other tent. I shouted a warning to the zone and promptly gave her the orders. (We DID NOT snarekite Garadain. You have what I consider ample amounts of time to get the head to Garadain before he charges the fort.) When I turned in the orders, the mobs spawned inside the Ry'Gorr courtyard. The 60 MNK pewled the Chief from the pack and they proceeded to slaughter him. Outside, my druid wife invised me and I ran into the fort to loot the head from the corpse. (I wasn't in the group that got the kill, so I had to wait even longer before the corpse was open to me for looting. I think I ate four or five of my fingernails waiting and constantly clicking.) Once I was able to loot the head, I got invised and ran back outside. <br>
<br>
Here's what most people DON'T know. (I had my wife watch Garadain and follow him while I was doing all this.) Garadain does NOT run straight for the fort. First, three packs of six KEWL looking soldiers form up. Garadain then calls them all together to one large group, which looked AWESOME. Garadain spent 1-2 minutes pep-talking them about how d0rfs ruled and giants sucked. This was when I turned the head into him and received my 8th ring. When I turned in the head and got my ring, Garadain despawned and left his d0rf army standing, waiting his order. The Ry'Gorr fort and its giants also did NOT despawn. <br>
<br>
It IS safe to give Garadain the Chief's head during his pep-talk to the Coldain army. <br>
<br>
THEORY: It might be possible that you wait for Garadain to give the actual &quot;CHARGE!&quot; orders. Then once the battle commences between them all, you hand Garadain the head and receive your ring. This way, the Coldain army beats the living poopie outta the Giants and cleans things out for the Ry'Gorr fort campers. <br>
<br>
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>

requires killing the dwarf traitor in Kael Basically what I got so far is you spam a phrase, the one in the note in a certain location to make him spawn, then hand him the note that implicates him. He will then despawns and 2 giants will spawn charge into the room. Kill them and a lvl 55 giant spawns, kill this one and another lvl 55 spawns. Kill the 2nd lvl 55 giant and a lvl 60 one will spawn (boss). The level 60 one is almost 100% MR can't snare can't slow. Kill it and it will shout a line saying the giants will no longer cover for the dorf and tell him to come out as he has caused the giants lots of trouble.<br>
<br>
Then the dorf will spawn again, killing it now will drops the head and the item to go on the 9th ring quest.<br>
<br>
When you attack Doldigun he says somethin like, 'Help, im wussy! I run now ... big giants help me!'<br>
<br>
He just disappears.<br>
<br>
Then 2 giants spawn in front of the throne, they are immune to charm, but arent that hard. I (a bard) tanked one :P so it was easy.<br>
<br>
The second thing that happens is that a Giant walks in from the door to the left of the throne (the rest come from this way) he too is easy, can be slowed/snared ... plops over.<br>
<br>
Third giant, same thing, slowable snareable keelable ..<br>
<br>
Last giant is seemingly immune to magic, level 60, and doubles for 180ish? He enrages too.<br>
<br>
I recently did it with the following group:<br>
<br>
58 Bard (me)<br>
57 Ranger<br>
51 Monk<br>
60 Mage (epic)<br>
60 Cleric (epic)<br>
57 Wiz (Al'Kabor staff)<br>
<br>
It was by far the most intense fight I'd ever had.<br>
<br>
The final dorf is also immune to magic, hits 150s ...<br>
<br>
Hit him as SOON as you see him or hes gonna run and train giants on you. He pops up right after the 60 giant dies and wil try to escape.<br>
<br>
And yes, you can give the note from Peffin to Doldigun at any time, I didnt give it to him when I spawned the giants with him ... then I found out thats how I needed to get the ring, went back, and gave it to him and got the ring (just by spawning him) and the giants didnt pop (you have to attack him to get them to pop, the ltter from peffin doesnt do it).<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
Alt Method:<br>
If you can kill him right away for the head why bother killing the giants? Just spawn him, then kill him, loot head. Spawn him again, hand in letter, get ring, leave. Info here is correct. Can kill Doldigun for the head, though you will need to return to get the Counicllor's ring. Seems to be no delay on being able to respawn him - just keep an eye out for respawns<br>
