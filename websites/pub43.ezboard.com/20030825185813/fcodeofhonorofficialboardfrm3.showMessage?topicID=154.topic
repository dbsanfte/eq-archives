really meant in the name Code of Honor, that question was answered last night by one of your own officers.  In a heroic saga of true sacrifice and selflessness, Lady Emawen Maelwys demonstrated that honor is truly the cornerstone of your guild.<br>
<br>
It was my own death which first brought Ema all the way to the Eastern Wastes from her warm spot in the Dreadlands.  She came over and helped me search for my corpse (which we later found was basically invisible and unlootable due to a bug).  During this process, Ema was attacked and killed by a snow griffon while waiting for me at the Great Span.  Fortunately Linamarae of the Amazons happened to be nearby, and performed the resurrection ceremony for both Ema and me. At the time I still could not loot my corpse, and Ema let me know that she had received a request to perform a resurrection herself for an unfortunate soul who had fallen in Crystal Caverns.<br>
<br>
After a quick Camo and SoW from me, she was off to help.  Not long after I finally discovered a way to loot my corpse, and I followed after her.  I arrived in the Caverns to find Ema searching for not one, but two corpses of a dwarven paladin.  Retrieving them required us to drop down into the cavern and find our way back out again.  I am a ranger by trade, and nearing my 48th season; so I could only camouflage us outdoors -- if the spell broke inside we were powerless to become invisible again.<br>
<br>
I believe our first sortie ended with me running for my life and managing to find the old dwarven city where the guards liked me a little better than the orc . . . lucky for me.  Ema escaped, but soon found her way down to me in the city.  Meanwhile the paladin we were seeking to aid died once again in the courtyard of the RyGorr fort trying to get inside.  Still Emawen was undaunted in her determination to rescue this poor fellow -- she had given him her word to do so.  More than an hour has passed in this misadventure at this point.<br>
<br>
We made a run up the geonid ramp to escape back to the Eastern Wastes.  Ema was guiding me, and ran right in front of me at the beginning of the tunnel where she knew she would get the aggro from the spiders and the terrors herself.  They chasing her -- biting and clawing -- all the way up the ramp, but we both made it out safely.  After a brief rest we moved into the fort and I guarded Lady Emawen while she brought the freshest of the corpses back to life.  We quickly moved inside the caverns with our new comrade, a dwarven paladin named Knytemare.<br>
<br>
On our second attempt to recover the bodies, Ema and I became separated (due to lag - ugh!) and she got lost in the process.  I managed to make it back to the surface with one corpse and my invisibility still intact.  Unfortunately Ema was not so lucky, she was killed by a spider when she fell into the water at the bottom of the caverns.  So suddenly she found herself back in the Dreadlands... Did she give up in frustration? No, not Ema.  Those of you who know her well might not be surprised at this whatsoever.  I have only had the pleasure of knowing Lady Maelwys for my last 7 seasons or so, and am still learning new things about her each time we meet.<br>
<br>
Amazingly, the dwarf we were trying to help had a druid alternate character; so he went to the Dreadlands to pick up Emawen (who of course nearly died again trying to get to the druid ring from KC).  The druid teleported Ema and himself back to the Great Divide and they both headed for Crystal Caverns again.  However, fate was not kind to Ema this evening.  Somewhere in the Eastern Wastes the two became separated.  The druid made it back to the caverns, but a filthy RyGorr orc saw to it that Emawen did not.<br>
<br>
Several hours have now passed, and we are getting messages that the servers will go down soon.  While Emawen worked on getting another teleport back to Velious, the druid and I embarked on a harrowing rescue mission.  After one failed attempt (due to consent issues) we finally managed to get back his original corpse of the dwarven paladin.  He wound up looting it, leaving only one corpse (the one I got earlier) at the zone entrance awaiting Emawen's spell of life.  Emawen, meanwhile, had returned to the Great Divide and was purchasing invisibility potions to aid her in recovering her own corpse at the bottom of the caverns.<br>
<br>
The druid was able to camouflage both himself and me and we made the same run from the dwarven city that Ema and I had made a couple of hours earlier.  As I passed the &quot;jumping bridge&quot; I knew Ema's body was somewhere nearby.  When the druid and I reached the beginning of the ramp to the surface, I told him to go on ahead and I would follow shortly.  I ran back and dove into the water to look for Ema's corpse.  I found it right away and ordered her to consent me (over her earlier protests that she would do it herself -- a bit stubborn sometimes, she is).  I picked her up and swam to the surface, where the spiders and stalag terrors were waiting for me.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, my armor was enough to withstand their blows, and I made it back to the surface with relatively little injury.  Ema finally made it back to the RyGorr fort, and then had to run all the way through to the other exit in order to retrieve her belongings.  After all this was done, we sat (invisibly) and talked outside the fort while she meditated to prepare herself for the resurrection ceremony on the paladin's one remaining corpse.  She hopped up and ran back inside the Crystal Caverns one last time to return the paladin to life.<br>
<br>
His corpse was too old.<br>
<br>
'Tis a night I shall not soon forget, that's for certain.  And through it all Code of Honor was represented with true Honor.  And not only did she keep her word, she did so with grace, poise, and charm the whole way through despite her harsh treatment at the cruel hands of fate.  To be by her side as she endured this and triumphed over it was . . . well, an honor.<br>
<br>
I salute the Code of Honor for selecting such fine individuals as members and as leaders.<br>
<br>
And I salute you, Lady Emawen Maelwys, for being a shining example of goodness and mercy that truly spanned two worlds -- Norrath and our own.   <p><table width="400" border="0">
