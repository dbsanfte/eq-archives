<br>
agro management is everyones responsability, not jsut the tanks, not just the main tank. everyone needs to be concious of how what they are doing is adding or losing agro.<br>
<br>
agro managent in EQ has gone through several changes, back in the day, whoever had the highest taunt skill, with the bigest baddest weapon, could keep agro. today it's very different. on the basic level, a mob will attack the weakest person in the group. level, AC, HP, proximity to the mob, all play a factor in how much agro you get. the higher level you are, the more ac and hp you have, the harder it will be to get agro.<br>
<br>
you'd think it'd be pretty easy for tanks when it comes to agro management, jsut mash taunt whenever it pops right? wrong. not every tank wants agro, 90% of the time, there's only 1 tank who wants agro. so the rest of the tanks have to learn how stay off the mobs @#%$ list. rogues and rangers have it easy, they have skills/spells that remove them from the mobs hate list(not completely, but a significant amount), but what about the extra warriors, pally's sk's and bards? aside from the basic reason for agro that i stated above(ac, hp, lvl) there's a second set of skills/abilities that agro. bash, kick, beg, disarm, slam and taunt all get agro. the main tank wants to use as many of these abilities as he has, everytime they pop up, he wants as much agro as he can possibly get. he also wants to be as close to teh mob as possible.<br>
 the rest of the tanks want to use as few of these as possible. they also need to be as far away from teh mob as possible, jsut barely inside mele range. i know everyone wants to do the most dmg output, but getting too much agro is bad, bad bad. when i am not main tank, i use a 2 hander, it's slow, it does alot of dmg over a long period of time. low taunt. if i am main tanking, i use 1hs. fast weapons do a small amount of dmg over a short period of time, thus creating more agro.<br>
 then you got spells on top of that. spells add a whole nother dimension to agro management. from a pally standpoint, my spells are a godsend for me when it comes to agro management. bash, taunt, beg, disarm, don't cut it for me, the caps are too low for them to be effective alone, i must use stuns. if i fire off 2 rounds of chain stunning(that's 6 stuns in a row, one after the other) i've usually opened the gap up between my agro and everyone else that i can hold agro with jsut taunt for the duration of the fight. granted everyone else does their part to stay off agro.<br>
 caster are the ones i feel who have to do the most work when it comes to agro management. when a caster dies from a mob, 9 times outta 10 i blame that caster for getting too much agro. sometimes it's the fault of a bad tank, but not usually. spells have an extremely high taunt factor, they realy piss a mob off. doesn't it piss you off when a mob nukes you for 500? or when a necro mob snares you? it sure does me. npc's work the same way.<br>
 casters never want agro, so they have to do things that keep them off the agro list. overnuking is the number 1 surefire way to get dead, guaranteed. no amount of stuns, taunts or anything can help a mage or wizard who is overburning. i've sat down behind a mob and taunted trying to get him off a wizard/mage/nooker class before and still couldn't get the thing off him.<br>
 i played a druid to a fairly decent level and i learned a few things about agro management. nuking at the beginning of the fight is bad, the tanks need time to get agro, we need time to get sufficient agro. one taunt for us doesn't = instant agro the way caster's spells do. waiting till the the mob is under 50% health will guarantee you the mob is sufficient pissed at teh tank(s) and you shouldn't worry about agro management. that doesn't mean go full burn, cause the same thing can happen, caster=dead. the same goes with snare, snaring a mob early will almsot always cause you to get agro, or worse, summoned. the fear of a mob running is non existant until the mob is low on health, so there is little need for snare right off the bat, wait till teh mob is around 50-60% then snare, snare doesn't create as much agro as nukes, so you can do it a little earlier.<br>
 shamans have it bad IMO, we need slow immediately to keep that mob from rippin through us, so shammy's need to slow immediately, slow creates as much, if not more agro than snare, prolly as much as a nice nuke. i had a shammy friend who went straight AC gear, he had around 144-160 wis, with better AC than i had, dood never died. i'm not trying to tell anyone how to play a shammy, but under their circumstance, i can see how ac gear would up thier survivability, cause of the way slow agroes. if the shammy can survive long enough for us to get them off him/her, then they can stay off agro the rest of the fight. dots IMO have a low agro.<br>
<br>
that's my rambling, i wrote this cause i got into a conversation a few days ago where a caster blamed the tank for not holding agro, when i feel it was the caster's fault he died. everyone has to understand agro, not jsut tanks.<br>

After playing a caster for over a year and now playing a ranger, i have a greater respect for agro management. I do disagree somewhat on the correct time to nuke a mob (after %50 health). Being a thin, robe wearing mage, its my HO that the only good mob is one that is already dead...duh. My point is that in a perfect Norrath, we will always be able to pull single mobs all day. Many places you can but many you cant. I cant cast well, as you have seen, when getting hit on....not for a couple more lvls neways. Adds will jump anyone in the group. Root it, mez it then continue on the with the first fight (which is still over 50%). Root releases, mez breaks (imagine w/o chanter), another add...caster is getting swatted. Healer is getting kicked. Rooter running around trying to root....first mob now at 50% or under and casters are starting first cast... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    not good caster management. Imho, kill mob as quickly as possible, without overburn, so that adds, by default, are next in line for tanks to taunt.<br>
<br>
Now from a tanks POV....<br>
<br>
Nothing sucks more then to see your mob take off after the non-melee. Everyone does the 5 to 10 second scramble then hopefully things return to normal just in a differnt location. When playing my ranger, if a mob takes off after a non-melee its an automatic root. I know this causes mob to fight till the death, but at least the casters and healers arnt getting poked 7 times for 144dmg. Wait to cast snare is so correct and i need to work on that hehe, but dont be afriad to root...its usually doesnt last that long but long enough to regain agro. Last night i grouped in Paw with 2 Pallys, a Warrior and two Droods. The MA was a nicely twinked lvl 30 Pally (Mal is 31), using mah uber blades (short quick dmg), the MA could not hold agro and kept bitching at me about it. I swore to him that i wasnt taunting and he didnt believe me... imho Rangers are bait. And yes, he was using a 2HS sword.<br>
<br>
Now a question....<br>
<br>
Is there a &quot;sweet spot&quot; when melee'g a mob? If i stand Mal right on the very outer edge of attack range it seems as though three things happen... One, I get hit harder. Two, I can hit harder and for more.  Three, i get most of the agro.. I have also noticed that pets will always stay on the outer melee range.<br>
<br>
Lastly.....<br>
<br>
I think that snare/root melee [can] play a critical role in groups. Thinking two dimensionaly, there are two points of mob control. The inner (fight, tank area) mob control and the outer (caster healer) mob control area. The inner support the outer and the outer support the inner. Most groups are absent of the inner control aspect and rely fully on MA taunting capabilities, meanwhile the outter support zone is providing the only support for mob control...  im a little prejudice i know, but i think rangers are over-looked alot in this aspect.<br>
<br>

 in a non perfect exp as you stated, espically without a chanter and no mana regen, you can't simply nuke liek that, you will run OOM and you will cause everyone to have to wait between pulls, the more the cleric has to heal you from getting agro, the more downtime the whole group will have. it's like when we were in guk the other day, and you would nuke right off the bat, i would have to stun to get it off you, i know you were jsut messing around to make me stun the mob, but the point is still there, the more i have to stun it off you, the more downtime i had because i didn't have any mana.<br>
 when it comes to crowd control without an enchie, that's a tanks job IMO, either root parking by a pally or ranger, or off tanking. nuking too soon before the tank has sufficinet agro will still cause you to get agroed, casters are meant to give a large amoutn of dmg is a short period of time, but have significant downtime. nuking after 50% health means you nuke half as much, but save half the mana. don't underestimate the dmg tanks do, tanks do outdamage casters, casters jsut do more dmg in a short period of time.<br>
<br>
your proximity to a mob doesn't affect how hard or how often you get hit, that's totally reliant on your AC, and how hard you hit them is dictated by your ATK. the range you are from a mob only dictates who the mob is more &quot;likely&quot; to hit, it's not guaranteed.<br>
<br>
root plays a role in who gets hit, cause a root mob will almost always hit whoever is closest, regardless of who is taunting. i personally don't root except to break mez. because if the warrior doesn't understand how his range from the mob affects his agro, the ranger, rogue monk may be getting hit instead of the warrior who is intended to be hit.<br>

<br>
rogues learn very early on, that jsut because you CAN do an insane amount of dmg, doesn't mean you always SHOULD. doing the most mele dmg CAN hurt more than it helps. if you are having a hard problem keeping the mob off you, switch to 2hb, 2hs or some less agroing weapons, ones without procs. your not doing anyone any favors by not letting the tanks get the mob off you. when i play my bard, and i get agro, i turn off all my songs, turn off auto attack, and walk backwards a few steps, generally this allows the tank to taunt if off me. i stand there for a second, tehn resume my songs and my mele. i jsut saved the cleric a good 400+ mana he coulda used to heal the tank.<br>

At times i can stand on the edge of chain casting and not take agro and at other times land one nuke and get all the agro...  Its seems more so at lower levels (one nuke agro) then at the higher lvls..See?  casters are a pain.. they break mezs and agros!...We could go on for days on end about casters vs. tanks vs. hybirds. The beautiful thing about this game is that they all complement each other. The largest task is maintaining accurate methods vs. mob given group make up. Thats what makes this game sooo much fun but at times soooo freaking anoying... wrong group members per mob or group not using proper methods. <br>
Thats like pets. I know how much Ari loves pets and thinks they are the best part of EQ heeh.. but pet casters get the shaft in this game esp at higher levels. A nice bunch of pets can do good dmg, but one pet can also wipe out multiple groups with one @#%$ up. Ima watered down wiz without all the tools of a wiz without my pet. I play a mage for the pet aspect of the game..thats what i wanted to do when i started the mage. I have come to control pets pretty good i think, but some zones, do to tracking, do not allow for pets.<br>
<br>
Your right about using the proper techniqes when req'd (gaters, healers).<br>
<br>
Mana usage is getting better for me. The nukes level off in dmg for the most part while the spells get faster and for less mana....fighting higher lvl mobs make casting more often a must....if your gonna have any effect at all.<br>
<br>
Save the cleric for the tanks... give mah ranger and healthy drood or shammy. <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font
