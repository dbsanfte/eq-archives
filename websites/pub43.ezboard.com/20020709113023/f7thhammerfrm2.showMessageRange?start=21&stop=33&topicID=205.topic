I friend of mine ( in game husband) from that mud was getting bored with the game and told me about this game called Everquest. I looked at the websites and went to the game store and looked at the box and thought it would be a nice change to play something that changes everyday. Bought the game and I chose 7th hammer because it was the easiest to remember and it was a &quot;preferred&quot; green server at that time. A whole bunch of people had just moved over from Xegony I think ( can't remember, to far back). <br>
1st day-  1st toon was a woody druid. omg Kelethin was an ass of a place to get out of. Couldn't find my trainer, couldn't find how to get out of the big tree house = ERASED. Started a shaman Elorni ( still got her, she at lvl 42 for 2 yrs /snicker ). Got lost in Halas. Ran around for 2 days lol, that's persistance, or retarded &gt; you choose. Didn't know anything but the newbie zone and those pest vengefuls. A shaman called Finaljustice gave me a 2hblunt fine steel and boy was  I uber. Him and a chanter called Truely ran around everywhere together, Don't know if either still play the game. After, someone said they would group up on Tundra area at lvl6. I nearly filled my diaper when I saw the mammoths and ever fearful of the snow orc shaman.<br>
<br>
<br>
After day 1 - Started Divina not to long after ( pulled ma finger and got a bunch of maps and hint sheets, duh) and have played her mostly ever since. Necro is fun. Have played cleric ( get to play /gems alot ) bard, druid, shaman, BL  up to or over 25 but only play them when I just want to stuff around and not worry about dieing to much.<br>

My first character was a human wizzard and I spent HOURS getting to level 5.  Even managed to save up enough for some cloth armor, actually had to save up twice cause I didn't bother to read what races could equip the first set so I had a bunch of cloth I couldn't even wear.  Talk about a bummer.  Couple days and another level later I got up the nerve to foray out into the Qeynos hills, no problem I though, and was happily killing wolves and snakes and large bats up on one of the hills...  night fell and I became a little disoriented trying to head back to town when all of a sudden <br>
<br>
Tovax Vmar's pet hits you for....  <br>
<br>
You know the rest of the story.  The CR seemed like it took an ETERNITY even though I swore I knew exactly where I had died (corpse was stuck in a hill, thanks to the person that introduced me to /corpse wherever they are) and I BARELY got to my corpse in time to loot it before it disappered.  I was SOooooooo frustrated by that night I actually didn't play again for a couple of days.  When I logged in again I decided that I wanted someone that could cast SoW.  Created a Barb Shaman that actually made it to level 14 before I got completely sick of starring at a book meditating.  At that point I created an iksar monk and had a blast with him all the way to level 15 when I decided I wanted to join a "good aligned" RP guild.  So I ditched the lizzy and created a human monk and have used him as my main ever since.  Still regret giving up on the lezaard though :(.  A year later I'm still here pissing folks off and having a blast, though I think I won't spend 4 years like I did on UO. <p><p>

I was a theif and the game was completely ruined when they took away snoop/steal.  plus you had to go to the evil world to steal OR pvp.  so I tried a new game.  it sounded cool and a couple people I knew from UO had it and liked it.<br>
<br>
I knew I wanted to be a thief, of course, but in this game the theives are called rogues, and *gasp* you can't steal from players!  o well, give it a try anyway.  I read a little of the player guide my roommate bought.  I created Aolani.  yep I stuck with my first char (sort of).  I pick a girl with red hair and green eyes like me, seemed only right.  let the game generate a name.  start in Qeynos.  wandering around, I promptly get on a boat and get killed by a madman I can't even see.  okaaaay...  no way to get my body back, which has my guild note on it, so I start over.  create the same char.  I'm running around exploring the city in the dark, fall into the water and drown.  again, lost corpse with note and start over.<br>
<br>
this time I start in Freeport.  find the guild with some help from a wonderful rogue I met in EFP.  god help me I can't remember his name.  my memory sucks that way.  I remember he was lvl 16 and I thought, wow, he's really high.  He helped me several times in the next week.  <br>
<br>
thanks to the maps in the guide book, I find my way out of town to fight snakes and fire beetles in wfp.  a deathfist pawn killed me about 50 times, but i had already been to my guild so nothing lost.  I leveled after about 20mins and was ecstatic.<br>
<br>
someone gave me a set of banded armor.  my rogue friend gave me a giant snake fang.  I was in business, killing orcs in EC.<br>

<br>
I had originally played major mudd &lt;a text based game similiar to this&gt; on local BBS's.  Used to have a Goblin Rogue, and in that game I loved to PVP.  Needless to say I got outta that game for one reason or another, and stopped the online games for a bit.<br>
<br>
Then I got a job, and met this guy I worked with who played Everquest.  He talked me into trying the 30 trial period, and I picked up RoK.  He had a level 8 wood elf druid, so I made a woodelf Rogue.  Got him to level 4 before rerolling him, I figured it was gonna take me forever to get to level 10, and not having backstab at level 1 sucked ass.  I made a woof elf druid.<br>
<br>
Got him to level 8 before deciding druid was NOT the class for me, and made a halfling rogue.  I was still a noob at this time, but wanted to get over to g-fay to play with my friend.  I had NO money on me, I just made sure sneak/hide was up ALL the time, and wandered the paths &lt;I also just found out about eqatlas&gt;.  The whole world was so much bigger than the one from mmudd, and I was in awe of how much there was.  I remember thinking that EC was the baddest zone in the game cuz there were these things called griffons that could actually kill GUARDS!<br>
<br>
My friend in the meantime, decided druid wasnt for him, and decided to play a gnome necro.  We leveled up together til about 16, then he decided he wasnt cut out for a necro and rolled a troll shaman which is his main today, mine being Gunnaf, 57 Halfling Rogue.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I think I lost my noobness around level 12.  Thats when I met a lvl 32 Dark Elf named Krullen.  Him and his buddies from Darke Wrath were trying to trick someone into attacking that wandering merchant by the orcs.  This guy obviously didnt trust them &lt;i think they tricked him before&gt;, so i got behind the merchant and told him to attack and i'll backstab the guy.  The guy attacked, he died, and Krullen looked me over.  He tried to duel me, and I told him to get lost there's no way i'd win against a level 32.  He then looked at me again, and invited me into the guild.  Damn, Krullen corrupted me!<br>
<br>
That's my story and i'm stickin to it,<br>

The closest I had gotten to an RPG were things like Final Fantasy. <br>
<br>
I loved the notion of a Ranger, in the classic fantasy sense, which I percieved to be a somewhat solitary nature-type, who was an expert navigator, and would use his bow primarily and if necessary, finish his target off with a blade, which is why I mothballed my Ranger after about 15 levels or so.<br>
<br>
I dropped in and walked around town for around an hour. I saw someone using the lift, which I didn't realize was a lift, so I just jumped off, like they did. I mean, that's what they did, just walk off the edge...?<br>
<br>
After killing a couple things, i went exploring. Wandered over into Felwithe and was looking around, and ended up in the water in front of town. Drowned before I could figure out how to look upwards.<br>
<br>
Most people I think attacked a merchant at one time or another but I never did... until about a week ago. sigh.<br>

I think my most memorable experience as a noob w/ Kail was running up to the skelly ruins in Qeynos hills. I had this fascination with looting mobs, and I tried to loot the skellies laying there, and found myself dead :P I was traumatized from that crap. <br>
<br>
Anyways, I thought video games were evil, then I tried EQ. Been a loyal addict since then heh. Ah well...could be addicted to worse things, right?<br>

Eventually I found East Freeport and even to this day I am not sure how I wandered into the Evil Guilds under East Freeport, but needless to say, a Human Pally was not welcome. Loading please wait.... I tried to find my corpse but couldn't see, some "nice" rogue gave me a lightstone so I could wander and hope to find me again. Well I did and died again. I called me friend Leeran and he got me out. 2 days later I called Leeran again and he had to get me out of the lava in Sol A. About 45 minutes later Moog killed me in the Najeena trap. Can't ask Leeran again, feeling kinda dumb now. That corpse rotted and I lost all 8 or 9 cloth armor items and my uber rusty sword. I was so bummed. All that cloth armor I had acquired...gone.<br>

<br>
 Ahh, yes: after getting my beta CD, I installed the game.. 2 weeks later beta started...<br>
<br>
Server crash, after server crash, after server crash and 8 hours in front of my computer, , ,at 4am, I FINALLY got into the game  and made a Gnome Necromancer named Darsius...the first thing I did in Ak'anon was put my dagger on, the 2nd thing I did was drown. It's hard to swim when you’re new kk? Soooo...I  found myself in Ateamfont, SOOO COOL...it was nighttime, I remember walking around, getting a sense of this gorgeous zone.. I remember thinking it must be cold here... As i walked around i ran into a precurious group of gnomes... They said " I don't remember a Darsius, were you on the test server before?" I thought to myself, Test server? This isn’t Xegony! so i asked"How do i get to Xegony? (where my guild was)" They told me i needed to run the everquest.exe and not testeverquest.exe or whatever..<br>
<br>
 So I finally got to Xegony, remade Darsius there, then drowned again And lost my newbie spells.<br>
Fortunate for me I got in a 6 man group and everyone but me died(These were UBER lvl 3's and 4's , they had a LOT of money...and back then when you died you , if you had autosplit on, you split the money you looted off of your corpse with the group) so I made a killing that night, like almost 4 silver (wow!).<br>
<br>
Anyways that was my first night..it was a blast i stayed up for like 3 days straight..<br>
<br>
 I had some adventures in beta, I was KOS in my own city to some NPCs and NO vendors would sell to me,They finally put a damn "evil vendor" in, but the food price was outrageous so i had to learn to fish..<br>
<br>
 At the command of my guildmaster, (kalynxian/Tak'reshad)who wanted all of his members to set up base near Westcommons,I had to make a trip... a trip to hell..<br>
 I was KOS to everything in freeport,I was KOS to everything in butcherblock mountains, Hell i was KOS to everything in between Ak'anon and neriak.<br>
<br>
 I think it took about 15 hours to get to neriak (6 or 7 boat rides: Boats used to SUCK back then, i would get killed before i could jump off the boat cause i had a pentium 75mhz with 16 mb of ram,ect..)<br>
Darsius,finally, after going thru WC and falling off the world, then getting murdered by a boatload of hill giants(west commons used to have about 60 hill giants up ,because no one could kill one back then and i also think they lowered the spawn rate) Darsius got to neriak with the help of a guild (ancient order) druid named Sublett.<br>
After all that i realized... Neriak sucked, so does WC, I’m going home, Dark elves are assholes, I remembered what that boat ride was like, so I made another gnome necro named Winderkin, Which has been my last name on every character since then.<br>
<br>
<br>
*just some notes...Ancient Order dissolved after release.<br>
I join Cunnans Brewing Co , Nurgle and others joined Inner Circle,a lot joined a guild called banished order, which i think contributed a lot of members to TDE and others. At the moment the only 3 AO,i know of, on 7th hammer are in Forged souls:Me , Mashesta ,and  Tovaxx.<br>
<br>
Thanks, this was fun..lots of old memories...reminds me of why i play this retarded game, Got too much history and too many great friends here to just give it all up.<br>

<br>
I had been a doom player for as long as it was out, then quake of course, and q2, at about that time, Lowger started working at the same company as I and we started talking, he was playing UT, and Aliens Vs Preditors, so i picked those up and we became fast friends. After about a year we were both pretty sick of first person shooters and were both still on 56k modems while all the kiddies were on DSL's and just tearing us up. So Lowger starts looking around and finds UO, and EQ. We look them both over and decide to try EQ, after a 11pm to 7am shift we drove 45 miles to pickup our copies. We returned to his house and started patching, when it started i said "man i'm glad i didnt open my copy if its this slow and messed up i'm not paying for it" Ok patch completed, Lowger makes a dwarf cleric, starts wandering around kaladim and i'm starting to think maybe i judged to quickly, he found a guard and i said, hit him!.... wack wack, dead dorf. I rolled, uncontrollably.<br>
<br>
Current Info<br>
Lowger has quit and come back 3 times and is now getting ready to break 50, I have played 3 characters past 50 and am currently a Monk Main. I have made it my duty to kill every guard in this game, Dorf #1 KoS to every bank except runnyeye. Dorf #2 KoS to half the towns in norrath. Iquana #1 KoS by nature - bottomed out half of every guard faction. And is currently working on the moon guards.<br>

<br>
First we (me and some friends) discovered the game by mistake!.. Ya one of my friend bought it thinking it was single player game ROFL... he wasnt sure if he wanted to pay for it... but we decided to pay andcheck if it was fun... It seemed awesome when we saw it for the first time and we all bought it and played...<br>
<br>
I remember my first char being a human shadowknight... geez... blind, boring, KOS lol... everything a newbie discovering the game would like!  I remember seeing auctions in EC for stuff selling in the K pp lol... I was looting like 2 cooper per kills... i was WTF... how am I suppose to buy that one day lol...<br>
<br>
I also remember fighting with friend to kill the orc pawn with cracked staff.. worth 1pp lol... also getting money to get leather armor... while thinking and looking at the prices of fine plate (around 300pp each lol) and was like WTF lol!<br>
<br>
But you learn and know loot is better from drops than from shops! and you go forth... deleted my sk at lvl 15 cause i was tired of dieing bein KOS mostly everywhere! and made my druid!<br>
<br>
Story of my life!... my druid equipment sucked till i was able to kite HG so I could make money from em and buy new stuff :)<br>
<br>
<br>
If I had to redo it... I would... but in a new everquest cause now i know a lot, tricks etc... but that was make the game fun to play... learn to play!<br>

With help from experienced players around me, I was shown the way out of Kaladim and to the docks in Butcherblock where I would make my way to Freeport, which I was told to do by my cousin (he got me into eq).  Upon arriving in Freeport I missed the dock and drown because I didn't know how to swim!  <br>
<br>
Oh well, back to Kaladim and ride the boat again!  At least this time I found the docks on my own!  Probably not the most exciting newbie story but definitely something a newb would do!<br>

Couple of months after release!  I was a Super Duper Dwarven Paladin!  I was going to rid the world of Evil and save a few damsels in distress.<br>
<br>
Shortly after slaying my first few monsters in the newbie area, I saw my first candidate for the "Damsel in Distress" position!   OMG, that lady is being chases by a Skeleton, I must try to assist.  I swear I chased the two of them for what seemed like forever and much further from Kaladim than I had ever been before, but I was determined to save her.<br>
<br>
Shortly after I caught up to them, I received a /tell from the Damsel in Distress to kindly leave her pet alone....  =/  /blush<br>

That was my first EQ experience, and I’ve never touched a Paladin again...  Yeah, Gnomes..  They sound COOL!<br>
