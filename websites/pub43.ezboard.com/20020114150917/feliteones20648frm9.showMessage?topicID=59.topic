<br>
  Could it be opposition to the principles of capitalism?<br>
<br>
  Could it be opposition to the Principles of Natural Law on wich this nation was founded?<br>
<br>
  Can opposition to a single historical event in our history classify you as anti-American? (like the Nukeing of Japan)<br>
<br>
  Anti-American is a word and has a definition. I would like to explore what you guys think it is defined as. in so doing, It may be helpful to Define America. What are its policies. Its constitution would be a very large part of this. What principles does the State hold dear? What is its history? where is it heading?<br>
<br>
  If we declare that we are not anti-American because we agree with these principles, is it possible that even the most patriotic Americans could turn a dim eye on the America of the future and still keep their own principles intact?<br>

We have labled those who &quot;oppose&quot; America in part or in whole as Anti-American. I dont know a better term to use off hand, but &quot;anti-american&quot; isnt the correct one to use.<br>
<br>
NEways...<br>
<br>
To be &quot;anti-american&quot;, as so defined, is no different then being prejudice in any other way. Its the same as being &quot;anti-jew&quot; or &quot;anti-black or white or asian&quot; etc. <br>
<br>
Why do these people not like use? Many reasons i spose. We are rich and we are pulling from resources all over the world to maintain and increase that wealth. Capitalism is a great tool to make one wealthy but yet it IS a heartless tool. Its obsticles must be overcome regardless of what it leaves laying in the street. If we didnt have &quot;fair play&quot; rules in this country then it would really be ruthless. How many Ma and Pa stores and main street hardware stores has Wal-Mart put out of business?  Countless. Im not saying its evil...only heartless.<br>
Many in far away poor countrys would like to tell us &quot;keep your american dreams in america and stop sucking this country dry just because you can..&quot;...  Its easy to see why many around the world would conceive us as mean, fat, bullies....and from that we pride ourselves.<br>
<br>
For one, we assume that our life style and freedom is the best in the world and everyone elses suck. This line of thinking is prejudice on our part. And that our lifestyles are the best in the world only because we have &quot;everything and can do almost anything we want&quot;!........Now then... these are not my opinions of the USA.... but many will defend it thusly...everyone calm down.<br>
<br>
What is America? To me it is God given freedom and liberty. It is a blessing bestowed upon us by God himself for us being a greatfull and thankfull nation.<br>
<br>
&quot;They will hate you as they have hated Me&quot;.<br>
<br>
Where are we going as a country? Depends on if God finds a reason to &quot;Bless America&quot;. Has anyone today given God a reason to bless america?<br>
<br>
Thats another thing that has somewhat crawled under my skin. All the God bless America signs and everything you see going up everywhere and the fact that most people dont even have a clue as to who God is. It seems to me that people are crying to be protected by God but yet refuse to change they way they live. Although much good has come of it... we have seen the Ten commandments posted in schools and public places again and at least God is in out faces...amen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We are a target...a BIG target for much hatred and prolly always will be as long as they see the hand of God blessing this great and wonderful nation.<br>

<br>
a person isn't anti-american simply because he does not agree with any 1, or everything on your list tryton. that is why we have the freedom of speech, it's ok to disagree with anything and everything about this country. that is a right i cherish very much so. i may not like the arabian cabby who tells me my country sucks and that he wishes we were all dead, but he is an american, and his right to say that and it is protected, wether you or i agree with it or not. in times like now people are looking to blame anyone and everyone, back when japan attacked pearl harbor, we rounded up japanese-americans and put them into camps. i like to think we're bigger people than that now, and can deal with this in other ways. ID cards are not the way, these people that are from the middle east that are over ehre are here for a reason, a better life, and chance at wealth and success, a better life for thier families. it's not their fault that the whack-job who did this happened to be of the same ethnic decent.<br>
<br>
anti-american to me is someone who doesn't love this country. i don't mean everyone who doesn't have a flag waving right now is anti-american, people show their patriotism in different ways. all the protest going on in pakistan and afghanistan right now are anti-american. they don't love america and they have targeted us for their hate.<br>
<br>
the reason they don't like us, i feel is 2 things, number one, they all live in poverty and many starve, yet we throw away tons of left over food every day. their religion dictates a certain lifestyle, the way we live is totally opposite, we allow women to hold positions of authority, women can vote, they can walk around without veils on their faces, they can wear different colors. they can be educated. men over ehre don't have to have beards. it's a matter of lifestyles clashing, and them not having the tolerance to let us life our life the way we feel it is best for US. we may not like or agree with their lifestyle, but it's all they've known and who are we to tell them it's wrong?<br>

In fact i believe YOU (if your honest with youself) will also agree that their lifestyle is wrong. Your just too politically correct to say it bluntly (I have no such qualms). After all if you thought their lifestyle to be &quot;Right&quot; then wouldnt you also do as they do? my point isnt that THEY think are are wrong, my point is that I think they are wrong. And what the hell is wrong with that? I think Murder is wrong.. I am not afraid to say it. also I think the forceable subjication of women is wrong. I think using violence to push your views on religion and politics is wrong. There was a comment made earlier on these boards that I, King Tryton, Oceanlord of E-Marr crusified people who didnt follow my political principles.  The fact is that I have used the written word (weather you think well or ill of the words) to try to pursuade my EQ compadres.<br>
 This is another giant factor.  In France during Napoleon's reign it became clear that to have political power one must gain approval of the majority of the population through a public debate, Thus ending the days of rule by martial law. And I also will affirm that this is right , just , and good.  after all if the words right, just, and good are to be defined in the world, Why not let it be my definition that i will spread through a public debate, then the minority will be ruled by the majority not by military might, but by coincidence. Why should the minority lead the majority? In many cases in our society i find myself on the short end of the democratic stick, So what am I to do about it? I am to preach the truth of my principles, If some will hear then maybe they will also preach to convert others and overthrow the majority who are cought in a lie,  But not to overthrow by means of military force, but by means of assimilation into this doctrine. This warfare is civil, it is just, and it is good. also it is bloodless.<br>

<br>
Anti-American - (definition of Zortlas) One who hates the United States of America.  This hate need not be warranted or Just.  It need only be present.  <br>
<br>
I think I agree with Ariakkas on one point at least.  Disagreeing with the Constitution(I know, not mentioned) does not make you Anti-American.  The lawmakers have often not agreed with the Constitution.  Amendments...<br>
<br>
Yes disagreement falls under free speech.  Everyone's free speech.  Even those contrary to the majority in this trying time.  I personally find it poor timing to voice such opinions, at least in certain ways, but then again taht is my opinion.  And I am already known to be the &quot;touchy-feely pot-smoking hippie&quot; of the bunch.  ;^)<br>
<br>
I know this is a late post in this thread, but I could not not throw my 2 cp in.<br>

<br>
Oh yeah!  DOWN WITH THE TALIBAN.  Their way of ruling IS BAD!  Hopefully a better govt can be set up now.  Time will tell right?<br>
