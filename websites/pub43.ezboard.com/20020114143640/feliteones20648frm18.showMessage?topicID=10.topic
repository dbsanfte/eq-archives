<br>
The Quest starts in Lake Rathe wear you must kill a named water goblin, Lord Bergurgle. He spawns in the underwater goblin cave, in the tower at (2800, 150). He is around level 40 and casts Complete Heal on himself. He is a rare spawn on a 28 minutes spawn time with a placeholder. The Deepwater Goblins spawn around him so have some companions come along with you and remember Endure Breath. He drops Lord Bergurgle's Crown. <br>
<br>
Take the crown to Shmendrik Lavawalker (3600, 0) who spawns once every 3 hours. Stay at his spawn spot because he is level 30 so someone might kill him if you are not there. When you give it to him he will give you Oil of Fennin Ro and Natasha Whitewater will spawn. Natasha will kill Shmendrik, causing a spirit of flame to spawn immediately on his corpse. Kill this level 40 spirit of flame who has approximately 3300 hitpoints. <br>
<br>
Loot the Damaged Goblin Crown from him. Natasha will also try to kill her so just root, enstill, mesmerize, or do something that will keep her out of the fight because if she gets killing blow it may cause corpse to disappear. The safest way to do this (but more time consuming) is to first just kill Shmendrik without giving him the Lord Bergurgle's Crown, then kill spirit of the flame and loot the Damaged Goblin Crown. <br>
<br>
Then wait for Shmendrik to spawn again, give him Lord Bergurgle's Crown, kill the spirit of flame and give Natasha the Damaged Goblin Crown you already have. Well anyways, after giving Natasha the Damaged Goblin Crown, she will give you Ornate Sea Shell. Take this Ornate Sea Shell to Omat Vastsea in Timorous Deep (-11567, -2227). To reach him, take the cave entrance at loc (-11530, -3728 ) , then the entrance at (-11336, -1307). He will give you a Coral Statue of Tarew. Take this Coral Statue to a seeker in the Temple of Solusek Ro. He is at (326,38,29) and will spawn at 9 A.M. and despawn at 9 P.M. game time. <br>
<br>
When you give it to him, he will take it and change into a Plasmatic Priest and start attacking you. He hits in the high hundreds and has 3000-3500 hit points. He is level 55 and casts Complete Heal, Tremor, Annul Magic, Reckoning. You should always bring him to the zone before attacking him because his Area Effect Tremor makes the keepers around him attack him and if they get the kill then you loose the corpse and you must start over. Once you have killed him, loot his Blood Soaked Plasmatic Robe. <br>
<br>
Now go to Solusek A and kill Lord Grimblox. He is a rare spawn on a 19 minute spawn timer will a placeholder (Either Large Fire Goblin or Fire Goblin Shaman). He is only level 30 and shouldn't be hard to kill. Loot his Lord Grimblox's Signet Ring. Now, take the Blood Soaked Plasmatic Robe to Omat Vastsea, causing him to give you Orb of Frozen Water and making Natasha Whitewater spawn again, in Timorous Deep.<br>

<br>
Immediately after giving Omat Vastea the Robe, run to Natasha Whitewater in a house close to Omat. Give her Lord Grimblox's Signet Ring and she will give you a second Ornate Sea Shell. Take this Sea Shell to Naxot Deepwater in Burning Woods. His location is (3400, -2150). He spawns there at 6 P.M. gametime and despawns at 6 A.M. He will give you a Message to Natasha. Now you must kill Ixiblat Fir. This is a level 62 immense Fire Elemental. Hit hits for up to 575 damage and has over 32000 hit points. He spawns in the Burning Wood at (-2000, 1500) . He casts a 300 damage Area Effect fire based spell. This spell is immune to fire elementals. His magic resistance is average to below average for his level. His is not completely immune to fire based spells but it is recommended that you use cold based magic. Once he is gotten down to low health, he will try to run. Try and keep him still because he has a fast regeneration rate. Loot off of him Sceptre of Ixiblat Fir. This drops every time. Now you have to kill the Overking Bathezid Di'Zok. This level 63 sarnak spawns in Chardok and takes a load of people to kill. He casts a 500 damage Area Effect spell, complete heal, gravity flux, and gate. You have to be careful when killing him. If you fight him at his spawning location you must be careful that he you don't aggro the Queen and you also have to be careful that he doesn't cast Gravity Flux. That will aggro more mobs in upstairs rooms such as the Herbalist. You can also fight him in the hallway but then you have to be careful he doesn't Gate. Then he will start summoning people and they will die. Loot from him a Singed Scroll which drops every time. Take the Singed Scroll and Sceptre of Ixiblat Fir to Omat Vastsea. He will give you the Orb of Clear Water and Natasha Whitewater will spawn again. <br>
<br>
orb of vapor <br>
<br>
Run straight to Natasha Whitewater after doing the previous step. Give her the Message to Natasha. You will receive the shimmering pearl. Now comes the most what most clerics agree to be the most tedious part of the quest, killing Zordak Ragefire. This is a dragon found in Solusek B. Although no one is absolutely certain about how Zordak spawns, it is thought that he spawns 1-3 days after Nagafen has been killed. There is usually always a cleric camping him so you must be quick in getting the camp. Also, keep a small group with you to clear the fire giants. They roam into the lair and when you are fighting Zordak, you will not want to deal with any other mobs. Give him the shimmering pearl. He will then switch to level 55 and attack you. Once you kill him, his true dragon form, Zordakalicus Ragefire, a level 54 dragon. He is an exact duplicate of Nagafen except that he runs at low health and hits slightly harder. All the normal Nagafen tactics apply. Loot from his corpse Heart of Zordak Ragefire and give it to Omat Vastsea. <br>

<br>
After the last step, Jhassad Oceanson will spawn close to Omat. Give Jhassad the three orbs: Orb of Frozen Water, Orb of Water, and Orb of Vapor. He will return to you Orb of Triumvirate and the Avatar of Water will spawn near Jhassad by the shore. He will then roam around the shore and finally come to stand next to Jhassad. It is recommended that you wait for the Avatar of Water to stand next to Jhassad because then you will get experience when you turn in the Orb. If you give it to him while he is on his roam path, you will get no experience and obviously the experience bonus is a lot since this is an Epic Quest. Turn in the Orb of Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water. He will give you the Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh<br>
