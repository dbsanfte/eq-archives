- Characters who disconnect while zoning shouldn't be 'stuck' for an inordinate amount of time <br>
- Pets no longer pace. Pets will now, when close to you, STOP. <br>

- If you right click to auto-inventory an item that you are looting and it will not fit into your inventory, the item will simply appear on your cursor as if you had left clicked on it <br>
<br>
<br>

- Characters below level eight will no longer see light blue cons <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Tales</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Grand Master Glox sat silently staring into the black waters of the Cabilis aqueducts, his thoughts tracing and retracing the recent visions that had upset his nights. The Lord Cazic was trying to tell him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was. The hand on his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder with a quick blow to the chest. The figure crumpled to the cold ground.<br>
<br>
Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils he had struck. He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying. The pupil reached up toward Glox with something in his hand. Glox took the items from his hand and peered at them intently. There were two items, one was a glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol. Glox recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror. It was the symbol of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the Shissar empire. Glox looked down at his pupil again. &quot;Where did you get this?&quot; The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward the night sky and the moon of Luclin. &quot;sSs... Ssraeshza... has... returned...&quot;<br>

Before this, Beastlords got thier first Evocation spell at level 30, which cost 75 mana.... you would need about 100 skill to be able to really cast it at all.... that's gotta hurt.<br>
