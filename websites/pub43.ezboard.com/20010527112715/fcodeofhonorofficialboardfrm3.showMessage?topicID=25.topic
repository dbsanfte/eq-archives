-------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
OK, I was asked to come post here with regards to my petition to rejoin CoH.  If I understand the current situation correctly, it seems some people are hesitant to have me rejoin because of the timing of my departure from CoH originally and possibly some other issues.  So let me address that, and a couple other things.<br>
<br>
First off, the reason I joined CoH way back when it was less than 2 weeks old was because my close online friends had formed it and they were people I grouped with easily 75% or more of the time I spent in game.  The closest of these friends were Ancalagon, Mirr, Meghann, Elad, and Harmani.  Over a short timespan, shortly before I left CoH, all of these people resigned as officers of the guild and soon thereafter 4 of them (along with another member or two) announced the retirement of their main characters and their intent to go play new characters (twinks).<br>
<br>
I completely understand the desire to take this kind of action (having come close to doing it myself at times... all the damned chanter nerfs), but it did leave me in the position of being in a guild where I really had no one left around my level that played at the same times as I do.  Harmani was usually off somewhere else and was at least 6 levels ahead of me, Tawonda is normally logging off when I log in (and 6+ levels ahead of me), Ruffen wasn't on a whole lot when I was, Gonda I really hadn't even met at that time and I don't think he'd joined CoH yet.  Gonzilla is always on at ungodly (for me) late hours, and Stahl was usually not around at the same time as me either.<br>
<br>
So I made a decision to leave CoH and find a like minded guild that would have more people on that I would be able to group with, when I was online.<br>
<br>
Let me put this another way... I was simply looking for people to PLAY the GAME with.<br>
<br>
That is what this is, after all, a game, and one of the many reasons I chose to play an enchanter is because they are a completely group oriented class... in other words, we require people to PLAY with us.<br>
<br>
Did I play up my departure in any way?  No.  Did I act in an immature fashion at all?  No.  Did I stop being friends with anyone at all?  No.<br>
<br>
Was my timing in leaving perfect?  No, probably not... but if you had a _real_ problem with it (as in you actually got angry at the time or such) then just ask yourself a couple of things:  1) Did you ever contact me to talk about it at all, or did you just let it fester?  2) Are you sure you're not directing some level of anger at me that you meant to direct at the 5+ major guild members who announced their retirements, even though they left their mains in guild still (and that isn't meant as any kind of knock against Anc/Mirr/Megs/Elad/Hal at all).<br>
<br>
Shortly after these folks retired, Stahl had asked for suggestions on what the course of the guild should be, going forward, after such a drastic change in the guild.  Enjoying being the devil's advocate in real life often times,  I _pointed_ out that one possible future for CoH was to disband, and for current members who wanted to stay together to create a new guild, possibly with a similar name (in effect leaving CoH as a legend within the game, a roleplaying potential that I thought to be avery cool idea).  Some people appear to have misunderstood that post, thinking I was saying the guild _should_ disband.  One must draw a distinction between someone putting forward an idea for consideration versus advocating that being the best course of action.  I was doing the former, not the latter.<br>
<br>
After I resigned Tigsen from the guild, I still lurked on the old CoH message boards.  The reason for this was that I still had two twinks in CoH, and even though I wasn't playing them actively, I was still at that time trying to figure out if I was going to continue playing Tigsen at all, or one of several twinks I have.  Since I had characters in the guild still I _thought_ I still had privileges there, and even changed my board login to the name of one of the twinks, so as to not be seen posting as &quot;Tigsen&quot; any longer on the CoH boards.  I lurked on purpose... I hadn't committed mentally to playing my twinks, so didn't want them posting very much on the message boards.<br>
<br>
When I did post, it was in response to 3 topics.  The first one was a topic in which Anc mentioned some raid that was going to take place, in which he specifically stated that some non-CoH members _might_ be invited.  I responded to simply let him know that Tigsen would be available to help if CoH wanted it.  Some people appear to have mis-read what I had offered and thought I was simply inviting Tigsen along.  If the old board is still up, you can go back and find the post and see that that is not the case.  At that time, no one questioned my right to post on the board using the Gruump login.<br>
<br>
The second time was when someone asked about a guild jeweler.  Tawonda responded mentioning the kind donation she'd made to Tigsen's jewelry fund.  I responded assuring her that Tigsen would still do jewelry for CoH members and let the person asking know what the normal deal for guild mates was that Tigsen offered at that time.  Some people were unhappy over this offer and directed people to use Gonzilla for in-house jewelry (never mind that he's normally on very late at night for most folks to meet up with).  Again, no response was made with regards to my right to post on the boards still (at least that I remember).<br>
<br>
The third and final topic was the worst one, in my opinion.  A CoH officer chose to make a disparaging remark about me in the public CoH member forum (it was obviously intended to be posted in the officers forum based on a subsequent post from the officer).  I chose to respond to the officer in question, suggesting that he calm down.  I'm sure I got a little sarcastic in my response, but I do not believe I stooped to the level of insult I felt I'd been dealt by this officer.  Several responses followed in which I attempted to defend my right to be on the boards still, until Tawonda posted asking that I resign my twinks from CoH and leave the boards.  Allthough I felt quite hurt by this request, I did as she asked... I did not post again on the CoH boards, asked Ancalagon to ensure that the login I had used was wiped out and that everyone was informed of such, and I /guildremoved my twinks from CoH.<br>
<br>
So the question probably is, why do I want to rejoin CoH?  Well, the fact is that even after joining ED (a very nice bunch of folks by the way but very few of them on around my level when I'm playing), I found myself still grouping with CoH folks more often than not, especially Gonda.  Lately, my other good friends have started playing their main characters again, or have gotten their twinks up in level to the point they've even surpassed me again, and they have also joined CoH (after a false-start in another endeavour).  Several CoH folks have mentioned on more than one occassion that they'd like to see me return to CoH, so I finally chose to do so, and asked Anc to start the initiation process for me.<br>
<br>
So here we are, except that there is obviously some doubt about allowing me to rejoin.  As I look back upon my past actions (as I remember them of course), I don't see anything that warrants an apology... however, if anyone misunderstood or misinterpreted my actions and that somehow caused them grief, for that I am sorry.  I realize that because this is just a game that most people would not follow up with another player in the game to clarify such things (I sure wouldn't bother in most situations) like you most likely would with a real life relationship, and that it is probably only because I've applied to rejoin CoH that anyone is giving it any attention at all, now.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps put things into perspective for those that it wasn't before.  Keep in mind one last thing... if you think this post is all just a load of BS and that I don't really care about CoH, then ask yourself why I'd write a small disseration (above), and be up till almost 2:30am doing it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Can't say a whole lot at the moment, but wanted to thank you for the note of explanation, and let you know that things are still being talked about.  <br>
<br>
Oh, it also doesn't help speedwise that there is a short freeze on membership that should be up this week (can't remember exactly, I'm no longer an officer and don't recall exactly what was stated). <br>
