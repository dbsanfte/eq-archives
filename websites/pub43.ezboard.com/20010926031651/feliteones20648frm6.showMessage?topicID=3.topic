I'm sick of all the lies that's been told against us that have been posted on the EH board...  And also where the blame has been laid for all the flaming.  There are lies in this as well, but I'm not going to go into it.  It starts with Rugger's goodbye post, and a very unfair response to our papa smurf, =/<br>

Well guys due to some recent developements and path that Eternal Haven has taken, I have decided to remove myself and all my characters from the guild. This is very hard for me because I have grown really close to you guys and do not want to screw up any of the friendships that I have made. I didn't make this choice because I was mad at anyone, and if any of you guys need some rug love just let me know. I made the choice because the Guild is going in a different direction than what I am wanting to travel. I play the game for the fun of it and nothing else. I dont need the best stuff and it doesn't bother me too give my good loot to a friend. I just want to have fun. Eternal Haven is going places and I wish you guys the best of luck, I just dont have the time to follow you.<br>
<br>
I am still going to be on the game so if for whatever reason you guys ever need me for anything I will be more than glad to help you.<br>
<br>
Again I am not mad at anyone, Eternal Haven is a great guild and I am sure that you guys will whether this storm and become one of the best if not the best Guild in the game. That is not what I am looking for though and I dont want to hold you guys back. So Good Luck to all of you.<br>
<br>
Much Love, <br>

No probs Ruggie, you want to leave the guild because of what Tryton said to you do that...<br>
<br>
<br>
Who planned 90% of EH's huge raids? Tryton? Nah it wasnt him, he was inactive in that area and if you do not want to not hear both sides before you disband, i cant stop you..<br>
<br>
<br>
Eternal is no differnet now then it has ever been, we are at a huge pivitol point where we can do things most small guilds cant, it was the same yesterday as it is today. Some ppl cant handle the fact that we want to raid and have fun. Shame on anyone who tells someone else how to play. We have fun, we help each other and whether you want to see it or not Me and Fiesti are the ones who put alot of effort into Eternal Haven and its future. <br>
<br>
So in saying that, if you were only in Eternal because of Kityanna, Tryton and Defen you dont have to stay. I dont want to make you unhappy, we are going places and we plan on taking whoever wants to be part of it. If your not into raiding, no pressures, you play how you want, you do what you want to do. There are alot of ppl who enjoy raiding, I for one want to see things other then Gfay and the pit in the Hole, I want to kill Master Yael and want to slay a dragon and whoever wants to join me is more then welcome. <br>
<br>
I have said this Karm has said this and I hope you all understand, Eternal haven is still Eternal Haven, Kityanna was not the leader we were the council, she choose to label herself even though we decided before we even got the name there would not be a &quot;leader&quot; but a council. Just keep in mind they left us, I offered to leave so Tryton can have his rule but he threatened to disband us all if I didnt take the leadership from him.<br>
<br>
I will miss you Rug, but if you want to follow them, then I wish you the best, i considered you a friend and an intelligent person, but maybe next time you run into something like this you should hear both sides before making a drastic decision.<br>
<br>
Good bye Rugger...<br>

well I really wanted to post this in the officer board to keep everyone else from seeing it but was unable to and my pride will not allow me to not say anything.<br>
<br>
Kity, Tryton, and Defen are some really good people and I consider them friends, although them leaving frustrated me, it was not the reason i am leaving. I have many reasons why I am leaving and I dont feal the need to or have the time to post them all. But you went and tried to insult my intelligence in front of everyone and for that you can go @#%$ yourself. The main reason why I am leaving is you and Fiesti. When you guys left the game I would have done anything to get you to stay, you were really great people, but for whatever reason you guys are totally different now and I wish you would have never came back. It trully sucks when you lose 2 friends even though they are right there in front of you (IG anyway). You 2 are no longer the people that I grew to love. <br>
<br>
I wish I could have kept this from everyones eyes but pride wouldn't let me keep it to myself. I really wanted to leave without ruffling feathers and maybe I would meet tri and fiesti again and all things could be better. I still think that you guys are good people I just think you have some issues you need to deal with. Hopefully one day this will be behind us. <br>

WOW i saw that post that was Made. I cant believe that this is going on and i cant believe that anyone would handle these issues like this. Ive never been a leader of a guild before but i know you dont handle it this way. I too will be removing myself from the guild as of today. This is not against anyone in perticular but It has to do with Value. The one reason i joined Eternal Haven was because of what it stood for, and the respect that people had for one another. Just the way you guys have been speaking to everyone makes me wonder if that respect is gone. You dont have to get defensive when someone tells you that they are leaving the guild for personal reasons. This was handled very wrong and i wont be a part of that. Consider me removed. <br>

This is a very sad turn of events indeed. I do truley hate to see anyone go and my heart is with them. Regarding mergers and the most recent one i would like to personally welcome everyone who recently joined. I do believe that as a family of EH we are of one voice and things as a merger or any big change should be put to a vote of the people cause a take it or leave attitude will cause many to leave it. I have enjoyed being apart of EH for some time now and meeting and making the many wonderful friends i have. However, do to the recent turn of events i am placing the EH guild on a personal probation. Friendship and family is what EH is to me and getting along as such.<br>

<br>
Rheaton just so you know, all the council wanted to have the guild input on LoM mergeing but Ol King tryton said &quot;We are the leaders we make the decisions&quot; So we didnt come to all.<br>
<br>
I vow from this day forward, that whenever a decision is made for Eternal a council member will post it, like we wanted to do but we were shot down. Eternal is a family and the council is no better then her members. We handle the politics thats all. <br>
<br>
If you all can get clear of this storm you will see that this guild is still the same in concept, only with 3 less ppl. <br>
<br>
I hope you all can overcome this little change, it is a bad one, and I will miss Kityanna, she was Eternal all the way. She made the choice to leave, no one forced her away.<br>
<br>
If anyone was confornted by tells from Tryton and wants to hear both sides send me a tell, email me or hell even call me :P<br>
