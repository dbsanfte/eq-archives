I do have some questions and would appreciate any enlightenment you all can provide.<br><br>Where I came from – the “world” of Plagues (aka Bertox) it was common that everyone was in a guild. I do mean literally EVERYONE.  Level 1’s were guilded from the moment of creation.  It was also common for most people to be either /anon or on /rp.  The /rp meant nothing in terms of the player actually being a roleplayer – it was just a means of hiding.<br><br>There were in fact very few roleplayers.  Roleplayers were considered pond scum, they were ridiculed and persecuted and driven into exile.  When I started playing EQ I started as a roleplayer – (I think it said something about “roleplay” on the box – and I thought that would be entertaining).  As time went on it became difficult to find roleplayers on Bertox – the RP guilds fell apart and the Rpers went into hiding and so on.<br><br>One thing I love about 7th Hammer is that I can do a /who in the newbie zone and practically no one is guilded!  (Surprised me at first).  I have noticed very few people are /anon or on /rp.  It has also come to my attention that there are a fair number of roleplayers on 7th Hammer and this seems to be quite acceptable to the player community.<br><br>Daktar and I are starting to get random invites to guilds. All of these we have turned down.  We don’t know enough about the server or the reputation of the various guilds to make any kind of informed decision.  Most importantly we don’t want to naively join a guild that has an undesirable reputation that could haunt us for the rest of our EQ days.<br><br>At level 16 we are starting to think that a guild where we could perhaps form alliances with others our level and hopefully “grow up” together would be nice.  But where do we begin?  Many of the people we adventure with are not guilded.  We could of course seek out members of a guild we might want to learn more about and attempt to adventure with them for a bit – BUT which guilds?<br><br>Are there guilds we should absolutely positively AVOID at all costs?  <br><br>Are there reputable guilds that provide a range of levels that would include those players around our level but also have members 50+?  <br><br>Is there a “7th Hammer Unspoken Policy” that players wait until a certain level to begin looking around for a guild?<br><br>We are very uninformed about how things work on 7th Hammer and yet from experience on another server know “just enough” to tell us things operate differently here.<br><br>We are also interested in hearing from you all about the various RP guilds on 7th Hammer.  Experience with RP guilds on Bertox was not impressive.  One fell apart due to a gross lack of leadership.  And the other was a bit too restrictive in its rules, as it required everyone to use /rp mode which was not told to us prior to our joining.  As a cleric I objected to this.  I did not choose to play a cleric so I could hide; I choose it because I believe it is a class dedicated to the helping/healing of others.  Consequently if people need these services they should be able to locate me easily.  If I am adventuring in a zone and some poor soul is in need of the special Immortality I can provide and they are searching for /who cleric I do not want to be /anon or on /rp I believe I should be available and easy to locate.  Ok well I admit I am very opinionated about some things.  Roleplay has its place in EQ – but insisting it be used ALL the time is unrealistic.<br><br>I will be quiet now and invite you all to give me lesson 101 on Guild Etiquette for 7th Hammer.<br><br>*hugs to all*<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Angelea<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/ulodarlodar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LodarLodar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style=filter:glow(color=Yellow strength=2><font color=White face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Ice Cream Man</font></table></span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/11/02 6:35:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www228.pair.com/judygale/3dhapp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The newcomer has more questions...</span><hr size=1> Welcome back!<br><br>There is some RP guilds on 7th... i dont recall their names though. <br><br>I dont think there is a guild "to be avoided".

We have travelled so far, and endured so much to <br>come to this horrid place at last. But I cannot go on, I simply have not the <br>strength to continue.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Enough of that, Mr. Frodo&quot;, Sam said, tears welling in his sad brown eyes. <br>The six months of travel showed on Samwise Gamgee, and the strain of getting <br>to this hellish point echoed still in his darkened countenance. His hood was <br>drawn up against the hot wind blowing from the slopes of the infernal <br>mountain. &quot;Mr. Elrond chose well, he did, when he held counsel. He saw <br>through to your heart, and knew you would be strong, Mr. Frodo, and that's <br>what you are. Come now, let's get moving. The faster we're done with this <br>unpleasant business the faster we can get back to the Shire.&quot; Sam glanced <br>uneasily at Gollum, still tressed in the elven rope, and scratching where it <br>burned his skin. Gollum glared back at Sam, an unmistakeable hungry leer in <br>his look. <br><br>&quot;Aye, Samwise, it has been a long road, it's true. I do wish old Bilbo had <br>never found this ring, and started us all on this perilous...what was that <br>noise? Orcs?&quot; <br><br>On the path ahead, a commotion arose. Cheers and ragged screams welled from <br>what sounded like a hundred voices filled the chasms around Mt. Doom with an <br>unholy cacophany. From the cave mouth just ahead, where the Fires of Mt. <br>Doom burned forever, a giant Ogre came stumbling out, and trod to within <br>inches of where Gollum, Samwise, and Frodo sat. The three shrank back <br>against the cliff in fear, but the ogre took no notice of them. Instead, he <br>raised his cudgel to the sky, and screamed in the full timbre of his ogrish <br>voice, &quot;WOOT! Dark Lord PWNED!&quot; <br><br>An answering call of a hundred voices echoed from without the cave, and many <br>a shout of &quot;Woot!&quot; and &quot;Gratz!&quot; came, as more and more beings piled forth <br>from the cave. Elves, Hobbits, Trolls, and Humans all came forth, slapping <br>the ogre on the back and looking at a small black bag the ogre held in his <br>other hand. &quot;PWNED!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Uhm, excuse me...&quot;, began Frodo. <br><br>&quot;Eh?&quot; the ogre turned and looked at the halfing, noticing him for the first <br>time. &quot;WTF are you doing here? Is that Mithril? Dude, WTF are you doing in <br>this zone in Mithril? Go to Lothlorien, and get yourself a Galadriel Skin <br>Tunic. It's like so much better than that crap you're wearing. Mithril, <br>that's like, tradeskill stuff, right? Hey, Ubernutz, check this hobbit out, <br>he's in this zone in fooking tradeskill crap!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Just a sec, Urofsuke,&quot; a half elf said from a little ways up the trail. <br>&quot;I'm doing loot. Did you say tradeskill stuff? Hah, how lame!&quot; <br><br>Frodo's head swam, with hunger and the heat. &quot;Yes, the tunic, it was forged <br>by dwarves long ago, and was given to me by my Uncle...&quot; <br><br>&quot;You're a twink?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Ah, hmm. I was just wondering..ah, you see, I found this Ring, lost for <br>centuries, and was sent on a quest from Rivendell to destroy...&quot; <br><br>&quot;You're doing the fooking QUEST?! BWAH, hahahah, that's rich, dude, no one <br>has the time to wait for that Gollum puke to spawn! Just come and kill TDL <br>and get his hand, and do the turn in from there. WTF, I can't believe you <br>waited for the fooking ring.&quot; Urofsuke peered down at the little hobbit, a <br>look of distain across his broad face. &quot;Doesn't matter now, of course, we <br>just pwned TDL and he won't be around for a while.&quot; <br><br>Frodo blinked, confused by the ogre's words. &quot;TDL...?&quot; <br><br>Urofsuke sighed, and took on a tone of voice usually reserved for small, <br>ogrish children who had eaten a froglok right before their dinnertime. &quot;The <br>Dark Lord, dude. The boss mob in this zone. We just killed him, so he won't <br>be up for you to do the quest part with that ring.&quot; <br><br>&quot;But the council of Rivendell....&quot; <br><br>&quot;Dude, let me tell you, Rivendell sucks. It's only good for tradeskills. <br>Only reason to go to that zone is to pharm crowns from Elrond. Nice crown, <br>but it's his rare. He usually just drops a no drop phial, heals damage from <br>Mordor Blades. Like anyone uses one of those POS things.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Pharm...crowns?&quot; Frodo's vision blurred, and he swayed backwards, <br>momentarily losing his footing. He knocked against Gollum, who let out a <br>yelp and scampered further back against the cliff. <br><br>&quot;Holy fook, it's Gollum!&quot; and without another word, Urofsuke smashed Gollum <br>with a mighty blow from his cudgel, and killed the poor, pathetic creature <br>outright. Gollum let out a small squeal, then lay still, pressed against the <br>elven cord. &quot;Hahahah! Fooking Greenie mob! I love those!&quot;, and the ogre <br>walked up and took a heretofore unseen bag from Gollum's back. &quot;Woot! <br>Gollum's satchel! This'll bring me a couple kpp! Uh, dude, there's another <br>ring on the corpse, it's no drop, and not lore, if you want it...&quot; <br><br>&quot;Now see here, Gollum was with us!&quot; Samwise began, momentarily overcoming <br>his bewilderment and fear to approach the towering ogre. &quot;We were taking him <br>to...&quot; <br><br>&quot;Can't claim an outdoor mob, dude. Gollum's FFA. If you didn't attack him, <br>he's not your mob. Sorry, them's the rules.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Urofsuke, my alt just reported Smaug up in Gondor, dude, let's go!&quot; <br>Ubernutz had finished handing around what appeared to be a darkened sword <br>and crown. &quot;We're porting out from here, you in?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yeah, I&quot;m coming. Well, nice talking to you guys. We're porting to Gondor, <br>you guys need a lift?&quot; <br><br>&quot;We have walked for many months to come to this place...&quot; Frodo began again, <br>trying to regain some measure of control over the situation. <br><br>&quot;You WALKED? In MITHRIL? To MOUNT DOOM? Dude, there's a port in at Minas <br>Morgul! WTF ever, okay? I'm outta here.&quot; And with that, a shimmering light <br>surrounded the ogre, and a whooshing sound heralded his disappearance, and <br>the disappearance of the other hundred or so souls that had gathered on that <br>desolate trail, leaving Samwise and Frodo alone, once again, with only the <br>bleeding corpse of Gollum for company. The one ring of power gleamed dully <br>in Frodo's hand, and seemed, for a long while, to be just a bit heavier than <br>it had been. <br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>EQ is not a role playing game.

Conclave of the Damned is one I am familiar. Unfortunately I don't know how most of the lower level guilds are so couldn't really give any advice or direction there.<br><br>I would agree to not just accept a random invite.  There is a post in the Guild section here listing lots of guilds that you can visit if you find time during the day to check out some of the sites.  Some are very well done.  That may be a good way to start out finding guilds that you may be interested in.<br><br>Other things to do may be to just look and see who is on about your level and talk to those people in those guilds.  Ask them if they have a website and what they are like, etc.  <br><br>I agree with whoever said there isn't a guild to watch out for and not join.. etc.  You'll find people who say to do that... but overall a guild that is right for you is where you wish to call your EQ home and where you feel comfortable.  Not what other people think.<br><br>You'll find random roleplayers around 7th Hammer.  You'll also find those who have no problem with you roleplaying, but won't necessarily join in.  You'll find those people who will participate in the same style as you while around you.  And you'll also find the assholes who think it's funny and silly to try to roleplay in EQ.  It's all what you make of it.  In my guild we have one person who heavily roleplays and incooporates it into most of her interactions with people no matter what or how they take it.  She might smack me later, but if you want to have a good discussion about roleplayers on the 7th, she may be able to give you more information.  Her name is Jules.<br><br>Best of luck to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/uladyangelea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lady Angelea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/11/02 12:41:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The newcomer has more questions...</span><hr size=1> Balasarius why are you so grumpy?<br><br>I don't think I am &quot;insisting&quot; on anything...
