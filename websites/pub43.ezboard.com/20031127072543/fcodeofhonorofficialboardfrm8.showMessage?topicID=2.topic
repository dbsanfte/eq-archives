Everyone in the village of Halas is smiling. Sir Beltor Litebringer and Princess Midyth Litebringer of Halas have just announced the birth of a son, Telshire Litebringer. <br>
     &quot;Isn't he cute Beltor?&quot; &quot;He will be a great warrior one day.&quot; Midyth fastened her eyes upon Beltor. &quot;Like his father?&quot; His eyes filled with love for his young and beautiful wife. &quot;So I hope, but for now I have a council to attend.&quot; <br>
     Years pass and Telshire grows bigger and begins to follow the footsteps of his father. Meanwhile Halas is growing and Midyth and Beltor have given birth to another child, Glaen. More representatives of the Light arrive every day pledging their lives to the Light and to Sir Beltor who will lead them. Soon Telshire is ten years of age he has finished his squire ship and is learning the ways of a Wolf. It is during this time that the revolution begins. The races of Light begin to band together in small groups all over Norrath and fight against the power of the Darkness. But it is in the frozen north, overlooked by the Dark, that the true army gathers. Over the course of the next three years Soldiers of all races and classes come to Halas and pledge to follow Beltor to the death against the Shadow. Humans, Erudites, Barbarians, and even the Halflings band together under the torch ,sword and mountain on the Litebringer banner. At the end of the three years a large army issues forth from Halas with Beltor and the banner at their head. At Beltor's hip rides Sir Telshire, now a full knight. Standing upon the walls watching the departure is Queen Midyth and her son Glaen, now three years of age. A year of fierce fighting brings Beltor's forces to the West Commonlands. The numbers of the army had swelled as Beltor reclaimed first Qeynos then Highpass and then Rivervale for the light. In the West Commonlands Beltor's forces prepared for battle while in the East Commonlands the Forces of Dark prepared to make a stand. Beltor received word that a force of elves, gnomes, and dwarves were coming across the ocean of tears on a fleet of ships he leapt at the chance to catch the Dark off guard. The war that ensued is still spoken of today. Beltor's Defenders, as they came to be known, charged across the Commonlands with Beltor and Telshire at its head. The Dark came from the other side and they met in the middle. They fought for three days and nights before the Dwarven ships arrived to a horrible sight. The ground of the Commonlands was stained with the blood of the fallen. Bodies covered the ground, bodies that were not only slashed and bloody but melted and frozen. The Faydwer force attacked with a savage force. Their attack relieved the stalemate between the Beltor's defenders and the dark. The Shadow faced with a two-front war was spilt and fled back to their homelands. Cheers rose from both sides as the Dark forces fled and their banner of pitch fell. Suddenly shouts filled the air, Beltor had been found. The defenders rushed over and saw what could only be described as gruesome. Beltor lay upon the ground dead, his skin was covered with burns and marks were it had melted away. His legs were sunken into the bloodstained earth up to the knees. Another shout rose. Thirty feet away the leader of the Shadow a evil elf known as Teforli was pinned to a tree by Beltor's blade. With sorrow filled hearts Beltor's defenders headed back to their families. So ended the Revolution of the Light with a great hero dead and a entire people free because of it. The Barbarian troops carried Beltor's body back to Halas. A search was set for the body of young Telshire but of him no trace was ever found. <br>
     Telshire awoke and looked around him. He recognized nothing. He reached up and touched his head; a long gash left a trail of blood going down his face and matted his hair down. He stood and looked around him. He saw that he wore battered armor and a broken sword lay at his side. A battle? He picked up the hilt and began walking. As he walked he examined the sword hilt and saw a strange mark in it. It was a picture of a torch and a sword with a mountain in the background. He knew that had to mean something but had no clue what. He walked for two days eating berries and drinking from rivers. On the second day he saw a band of humans walking in his direction. He walked towards them and explained his situation he was lost and remembered nothing. The soldiers took him to a small town called Freeport. He learned of the revolution and of the fabled hero who led them. He was granted a small pension for his assumed service in the war. He knew no name for himself but it never quite bothered him and he went without a name for two years. Over those two years he bought a farm outside Freeport and remained somewhat secluded. One day during late winter he was walking through town and he bumped into a beautiful stranger who laughed and him and asked his name. Telshire stood dumbfounded<br>
He looked around and saw a Hawk alight on a nearby building. Winterhawk, Tankin Winterhawk. A smile crossed his face. <br>
     Glaen sees his mother with tears streaming down her face as she watches the procession return to fair Halas. She lost both her husband and a son in the battle. A large burial in sued and a ceremony for the lost prince was also done. On Glaen's fifth birthday he chose his future and to his mothers dismay took up the sword as his father and brother had. <br>
     The wedding was nothing big for Tankin had no Family and Lithute had little. It was now three years from the revolution and Tankin and Lithute Winterhawk had settled down with a ring upon their fingers. Their first child, Melisa was brought into the world nine months later. And nine months the Tunare blessed them with twin boys, Jacon and Acdin. <br>
     It was almost time for his 3rd anniversary so Tankin headed into town to do some shopping. He spent the whole day there and found the perfect ring. A bit expensive for what he made, but she was worth it. As he traversed the road back to his farm he saw a large pillar of smoke. He began to run and turned a corner to see his house in flames. He ran towards it and tripped on something on the ground. He looked down and saw he had fallen over Jacon; his little body lay sprawled on the ground and his head three feet away. Wide-eyed Tankin stood and looked around to the other side was Acdin. They had tried to run together. Tears streamed down his face as he saw his home and a little body halfway out the window, singed and burned to a crisp. It was young Melisa. Barely strong enough to move his legs he began to call wildly for his wife. It is then that he sees Lithute Laying on he ground with her clothes ripped off and her neck in an unnatural angle. He scooped her into his arms and screamed with rage, anguish, and sorrow. The next day his neighbors found him passed out with his wife in his arms. They carried him to Freeport where they held a small burial for the dead. Tankin took to drink. For three months he used up his money and never sobered up. One day as he was stumbling along he happened upon the temple of Rallos Zek. He went in and approached the front. As he looked around he saw statues of death and destruction. It was then that he decided on his future. He put down his bottle and spent the last of his money on a sword. He then made a oath that he would she retribution delivered to the Dark, even to those that slew his family. He was 18 years of age.<br>
     Glaen stood in front of the council and was made squire to Sir Wimbly. He was now 8 years of age.<br>
     The next five years of Tankin&amp;#8217;s life was spent traveling Norrath fighting the Shadow wherever he found it. He became dangerously close to passing over himself. His entire life became bloodshed and the hunt. He held no regard for life, his or that of any other. His heart became cold he was lost to all that was good. For six long years he went on like this ever slipping farther away from the Light. He would kill but that was never enough he needed more and more to satisfy this new lust for the dark blood of the Shadow. Vengeance was his entire life. One day as he was passing through a land none as Karana He met a monk named Mirr. Mirr was of the Ashen order and saw the anguish that young Tankin was in. He approached him and confronted the hate that lay therein. Tankin not wanting to give up the fight attacked Mirr. Tankin was soon on the ground, disarmed and injured. Tankin and Mirr began meeting to discuss the Light and Dark and what was going on with Tankin. After a long time of counseling Tankin recovered form his thirst and re-entered the light. As a token of trust he was brought into The Code of Honor, a group of people who are sworn to uphold the Light and protect the residents of Norrath. Tankin was now 25 years of age.<br>
     Glaen once again stood before the council as he was pronounced Sir Glaen Litebringer of Halas, a full Wolf of the North. He was now thirteen years of age. After his bringing up to full Wolfhood he chose a guild. Wanting to follow the footsteps of his lost father he chose a guild that had formed after the revolution with the same goals in mind. Glaen chose the guild known as the Seventh Tower, which in turn changed into the Iron Tower. Glaen realized that the Iron Tower had lost the beliefs he had signed on to fight for. It was then that he met Mirr a monk of the Ashen order, a old friend form the Tower that told him of The Code of Honor. After contemplating on what he should do Glaen joined the Code and doing so dedicated his life to serving the Light. On the day that Glaen was knighted he made a Oath to his mother to find out the fate of his lost brother. And while he fought the Dark he traversed the Lands searching for Telshire. He was now 15 years of age. <br>
     No matter what happened Tankin always felt a empty place inside, lessened by his new found friends but always a empty spot, a feeling of loss for his family. He never spoke of it to anyone, never a soul. One day while Tankin Moved through a town called Halas he ran into a young woman he looked at him, smiled and asked his name. *The courtship of Freia is not available until Tankin returns for the files were lost in the moving of halls* He was now 29 years old<br>
     Glaen kept up the search five long years after his initiation to the Code but never found so much as a clue. He made friends with a young warrior named Tankin who, though often unhappy, was a great friend. At the age of 20 Glaen&amp;#8217;s mother, Midyth passed on. Glaen sought to drown his sorrow in a drink and found Tankin at the bar. Only Tankin was celebrating, celebrating his engagement to the beautiful Freia Djarva. They drank in sorrow and in joy and eventually when they were somewhere beyond sober Tankin began to tell his story, to confide it in Glaen, his friend. As Glaen listened to his story he was reminded of his father.  Tankin described how he had been told that he fought in the Revolution of Light. It was only when Tankin reached into his pouch and removed the hilt that he never showed anyone that Glaen knew for sure who he was. For the symbol on the Hilt was the seal of House Litebringer. Glaen gasped but kept it to himself, watching to see that he indeed carried the noble blood. He was now 20 years of age.      <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/fcodeofhonorofficialboardfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=2.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br><a self href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/fcodeofhonorofficialboardfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/fcodeofhonorofficialboardfrm8.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/fcodeofhonorofficialboardfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/fcodeofhonorofficialboardfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub43.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm3">Public<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm5">Public Announcements<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm8">Stories<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm2">Announcements<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm1">Members<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm6">Application status.<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm7">Guild Status<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm10">Guild Roster<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm9">Bank Account<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm15">Knowledge Corner<option value="codeofhonorofficialboardfrm4">Officer</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3299CC>- </font><a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/bcodeofhonorofficialboard>Code of Honor</a><font color=#3299CC> - </font><a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/fcodeofhonorofficialboardfrm8>Stories</a> <font color=#3299CC> - </font><a href="http://members.aol.com/codeofhonorvz/">Code of Honor</a><font color=#3299CC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
