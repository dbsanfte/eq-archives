It seemed very interesting. You go online and play a character and interact with other real people and their characters. And you get to group together and fight dragons and stuff! The next day, I went to CompUSA and saw it on sale for ten dollars. Can't beat that. I bought it and took it home....<br><br>I looked at the server list and found &quot;The Seventh Hammer&quot; one of the very few I could pronouce. So I chose that one.<br><br>When it came time to choose a character, I started with wizard because I remembered wizards were cool in other video games I had played. I remember entering the world for the first time and thinking how cool it was to see another person walking down the street from me. I remember thinking, &quot;Wow, that's a real person.&quot; lol<br><br>I fooled around with the keys and eventually pressed &quot;A&quot;. Since I had targeted myself, the battle music started playing, the text box asked me to stop attacking myself, and I started getting stressed out. I didn't want to kill myself, after all.<br><br>Eventually, I found myself in Greater Faydark and looked for something to beat up. I found a bat (or it found me). Due to my newbieness, dial-up lag, and me not on auto-attack, I soon died. That's wasn't so fun.<br><br>So I played around with other characters. I started a human warrior in Freeport. I wait on the docks for the boat to show up. It did after a long time, and I zoned into the ocean. Zoning for me took five minutes, haha.<br><br>After a few more characters, I went back to the wizard. I read up on a few things and went out to fight bats again. The second time around, I won! Encouraged, I felt invincible until an unexpected encounter with an orc pawn. I learned quickly about running to the guards.<br><br>A half hour later, I got level two. I was so happy. &quot;A level a day!&quot; I thought with a smile. &quot;This game is easy!&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/uarinnelessedil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ArinnElessedil</A> at: 6/20/02 11:05:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/uthuuglyfe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thuug Lyfe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle> 1    Poster<BR><TABLE WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=7 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0><TR HEIGHT=5><TD WIDTH=2 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=2 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD></TR><TR HEIGHT=2><TD WIDTH=2></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=2></TD></TR></TABLE></span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/02 12:09:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Your First Day Of Playing Everquest (Share Your Stories!</span><hr size=1> First Character: Sendory Barbarian Warrior<br><br>   My brother (Baashe 57 monk) got a game called Everquest for his birthday, his friends played it at the time.

He'd skip class to play EQ, and I'd spend all my time between classes watching him play. We had another friend who played a DE Necro (also a dorm neighbor). Of course I wanted to play with them, so I researched what I wanted to be. I had to be an evil healer of some sort, but I didn't want to be a DE because I spent too much time watching my SK friend struggling with encumbrance, and while watching him, I had seen an ogre kill a mummy in like 2 seconds. Looking up the differences between troll and ogre, I went with troll because of the natural regen and the goofy green look.<br><br>So then I finally got a copy of EQ, rolled my shaman (and of course forgot to max my wis at creation), and started playing. By the time I levelled up to like 6 or 7, my dorm neighbors stopped playing but of course by then I was hooked. I spent the next few weeks levelling up (solo. innothule is almost always deserted) on frogloks and young kobolds and orcs before finally being brave enough to venture into South Ro. Of course S Ro was also usually deserted. I did get a group a few times, killing dervs and undead. It was there that I learned about mobs invulnerable to non-magic weapons when my group was wiped out by a ghoul. I was fortunate enough to get a Midnight Mallet a short while later from someone trying to get an Ivandyr's Hoop.<br><br>So I continued levelling (on what I later realized was woefully inadequate equipment), eventually joined a guild (Blood of the Fold) with a friend I had made back in the swamp, and made the switch to Seventh Hammer during the split when I was around level 35.<br> <p><hr align=left width=40% size=3><table><tr><td><img src="http://chip-web.com/~ludwigp/eq/sigpic_09mini.jpg" width=60 height=60></td><td>[60 Oracle] Zugugg Kindsoul (Troll)<br>[50 Monk] Zininn (Iksar)<br>[44 Taxi Slave] Nuvany (Wood Elf)<br><Forged Souls></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/ubalasarius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balasarius</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle> 1    Poster<BR><TABLE WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=7 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0><TR HEIGHT=5><TD WIDTH=2 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=2 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD></TR><TR HEIGHT=2><TD WIDTH=2></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=2></TD></TR></TABLE></span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/02 1:35:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cecpeople.bu.edu/lnalewak/balamini.jpg height=109 width=109></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: eq</span><hr size=1> I picked up EQ -- &quot;Ruins of Kunark&quot; -- while waiting for the original Icewind Dale to come out.

I made a level 1 mage (after all mages were the big spell casters in AD&amp;D).  First thing I did I killed a few spiders, now that I am a killing machine with my Dagger and Burst of Fire I managed to get level 2.  Ran around trying to explore and found an orc camp (no idea how I managed to make it to East Commons from Neriak and not die).  Ran up and before I could type hello, orc kills me, a very rude introduction.  <br>  I appear back in the dark forest, all items and newbie robe gone.  I again refused to give up exploration and managed to find Lavastorm, what scary music when you first zone in there.  <br>  Equipped with Burst of Fire and a Dagger* I managed to avoid monsters and find a big broken door of Najera, ran into there and decided to do my first dungeon crawl, few steps ahead, a pile of bones materialized and quickly killed me.  <br>  Back in the dark forest.  At this point the game did not look like fun, I was sitting by newbie log as it was known about to log when a nice necromancer lady called Tooti gave me a Runed Totem Staff and told me not to give up.  That was very generous to someone who knew nothing about the game.  <br>  So I whacked my way to level 4.  Saved enough money to buy a few spells, one of which was Summon Elementalkin: Water.  Well I thought this was an elemental spell like in Diablo, you cast it at enemy and this elemental charges and hurts the enemy.  So I find a spider and cast the spell and nothing happen, so I run to the spider and notice something is following me, so naturally not wanting to die I figure I will run to guards and they will kill this thing.  Not really knowing the zone I spent about 10 minutes running and jumping with this thing following me.  At this point I have done /shout HELP, /say HELP, /yell with people looking stangely at me as I kept running around.<br>  Then I ran unto a skeleton which attacked me, so I figured I am bound to die, so I stopped and saw the blue blob that was chasing me was fighting the skeleton now, didn't take long to realize who Jabober was when I saw the infamous &quot;Taunting Attacker Master&quot;...  to be young again... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> <p><table><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom" style=""><a  href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=84260" target="_magelo_" style="text-decoration: none;"><font style="font-family: Arial Black; font-size: 16px; color: red;"><b>Glasya</b></font></a></td><td><big><a href="http://www.foreverquest.com/" style="text-decoration: none;"><font style="font-family: Arial Narrow; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(255,0,0);">&lt;Fires Within&gt;</font></a></big></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/uszacharmore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Szach Armore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle> 4    Poster<BR><TABLE WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=7 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0><TR HEIGHT=5><TD WIDTH=2 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=2 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD></TR><TR HEIGHT=2><TD WIDTH=2></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=2></TD></TR></TABLE></span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/02 2:39:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: eq</span><hr size=1> My first time playing EQ...ahh....the memories. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Well, most of my newbiehood was spent switching from character to character, slowly learning. I've forgotten most of them, but remember my very first character. He was a Half Elven Ranger, I've forgotten his name. It was generated. My first 15 minutes were spent reading the manual and figuring out how to equip my sword, move, run, etc. When I finally ran into another person, I ran up to her (I believe she was a Wood Elf NPC in Surefall) and hailed her. She showed no response, and just kept standing there. I was wondering why a person would just stand there and do nothing, so I ran up to her and pressed the &quot;a&quot; button, to maybe see if I could get her attention (by attacking her). Big hit, then she cast a spell on me and blew me away.<br><br>Next thing I know, I'm somewhere where I've never been before. I see two people standing near me, I'm guessing they're guards. I made sure to stay away from them this time. So, I run all the way out near the fire out there (where those 2 NPCs usually sit), got lost, and eventually ran into...dun, dun, dun! a bat. I attacked it (bare fisted, I thought I had lost my sword), and beat it. But barely! I quickly found my way back to the fire, rested to full health, and went on the hunt again. It was still night time, so I got lost again. I then ran into a decaying skeleton, which I decided to attack. Unfortunately for me, it had another skeleton friend nearby, and it quickly came over to come and beat me up. After dying a second time, I lost interest in the game, and quit. But that wasn't the last time I'd be playing EQ. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/ualeguzzler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aleguzzler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style=filter:glow(color=Blue strength=3><font color=White face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Dorf Extraordinare</font></table> </span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/02 3:39:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Your First Day Of Playing Everquest (Share Your Stories!</span><hr size=1> Rorek was origionally a Paladin, got him to lvl 9, realized Pally's am teh suk.

So I went to his house and he showed me the game, then he got up from his chair and told me to make a character but I refused.<br>It took him three months to talk me into playing, something about getting online with a bunch of other people and having no idea what the hell I was doing made me nervous.<br>Finally Seacanyon got me to make a character, a green eyed Erudite wizard named Kalaluna. I was hooked but I didn't have my own computer much less my own account. I spent hours playing Kala after my best friend had gone to bed. Finally one day I was able to buy a computer and get my own account.<br>I don't know why but for some reason I decided I wanted to be a dark elf, and purple-eyed necromancer appealed to me in some twisted way.<br>So I made Viliu (a computer picked name btw). I stood in Neriak Commons for some time before meeting Cyvarth, a good friend now that was kind enough to show me where the guild was then came to my rescue and later helped me get out of Neriak into the Nektulos and to the newbie log.<br>Seacanyon, trilled not only because I had gotten my own account but because he was finally going to get his computer back, ran over and gave me a few raw silk things he was able to tailor himself.<br>On the first day of life, after things settled down a little bit I met another person that has since become the person Viliu calls her sister, Ivei.<br>I remember how amazed we both were that by just sitting at the newbie log people would look at our equipment then hand us stuff without us even asking. And how awesome it was when we grouped with a high level 20 cleric to kill halflings silly enough to be camped in our forest.<br>My first day was also when I met Rinna Lightshadow, repeatedly and I learned that she has a very rude way of welcoming dark elves. (I swear I'm bringing her down one day). And it was when I also learned how the Paladin guards in North Freeport feel about DE necromancers. I have no idea, other than shear noob dumb luck, how I got from the Neriak entrance in Nektulos to Rinna Lightshadow's hut without dying (I think it was four times because I was trying to get my body back).<br><br><br> <p><B>Viliu Ironscale</B><BR>Inky, Inny luvin' Heretic of 54 winters<BR>Proud member of Steel Thunder - Seventh Hammer<BR><BR>"No I can't give you crack but I can make you dead."<BR><BR><B>Viliea Sombradelaluna</B><BR>Priestess of Innoruuk of 36 winters<BR>Proud member of Steel Thunder<BR><BR>"I'm out of mana but by all means, pull the swardwurm.

I was scared as hell so I printed out the EQAtlas map out of it. I died within like 5 minutes of entering the zone, so I had to get back down that dark tunnel (Barbs are blind, and my level 9 IV spell is sold in freeport lol).... bought a torch and made it back, almost died training the gnolls to the zone.   It was there that I met my first longtime friend, a shaman named Grumblefish.  Not sure if he still plays, but he has a bard named &quot;Churro&quot; for a while.<br><br>Then I eventually made it into an elite ledge group. I can't remember everone in that group, except there was Muppo, (level 7 Gnome magician at the time) and Mikah (a level 11 Ranger, and he had banded mail). I had a Morning star... yes the plain 8 damage 40 delay non magic kind you buy in a store for 17 plat.  There was also another shaman in the group but I can't remember her name. I DO know that she convinced me to run to freeport for my night vision spell, and got me into an orc 1 group in EC a couple days later.<br><br>I remember muppo and I dinged on the same kill, he got level 8, and I got level 9. I was amazed by his pet... it rooted stuff and looked really cool, and I remember that I had read that shamans got a pet at some really high level, and wondering if I'd ever get that high.<br><br>The next couple months I ambled through the levels, I kept muppo on my friends list (he still plays, his monk is named Xukanis) and he very quickly rose through the levels.  I eventually ventured to faydwer and checked out crushbone, because I hated oasis with a passion.<br><br>It was there in crushbone that I got invited to join a tower group, and partnered with Relan (who was also level 17 at the time, and had full banded) and I met Wory, who was Clad in full bronze armor with a Langseax of the wolves.  Wory reccomended me and I later joined the guild &lt;Blademasters&gt; where I met then Chubby, Tavist, Danicah, Erathko, Smirnoff (aka Kjia), and a number of other great people.  Also Xanais joined the blades a couple days after me.<br><br>Then I headed to unrest, and fought there a bit until my friend Grumblefish (Now playing Churro) tells me to come to the overthere, he's found a great spot to fight, without too many people, yet easy to get a group.  So I make the trek and finally get to kunark. Within 30 seconds of zoning in, (it was raining and I couldn't see anything) I was killed by dark elf guards at the fort, and my body is in the water.... The GM at the time was kind enough to ressurect me, had never met a guide before... but a wizard with a sword sure looked funny.<br><br>From there I hunted at the mud pit a while, and headed to the dreaded zone that is Lake of Ill omen. I hated this zone (there were surprisingly few lamers then) so I left and headed back to unrest, where I managed to ding 24, and finally become a real shaman (Cannibalize and Regen, gotta love it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br><br>Oh yeah, I remember raiding Dalnir with the blades, we had a kick ass group that I was too low (level 24) to get experience in, because chubby was like 44 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  still, it rocked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table align="center" border="5" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; color: #8888FF; bordercolor="#9999FF" bordercolorlight="#5555FF" bordercolordark="#000088"><tr><td align="center" bgcolor="#000000" WIDTH="234"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE=+0><IMG SRC="http://www.grizlorspics.iwarp.com/tunaresuxsmall.jpg"><BR><I>Deny your Maker</i></font></td><td bgcolor="#000000" align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#5555FF">My Toons:</b><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45358" target="_blank"><b> </font><FONT COLOR="#CDDFF">Grizlor</a></b></font> Shaman<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48124" target="_blank"><B><FONT COLOR="#CDDFF">Bigbrawler</a></b></font> Monk<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56772" target="_blank"><B><FONT COLOR="#CDDFF">Ellone</a></b></font> Rogue<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=177859" target="_blank"><B><FONT COLOR="#CDDFF">Gobobtik</a></b></font> Beastlord<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=152243" target="_blank"><B><FONT COLOR="#CDDFF">Xylophone</a></b></font> Bard</font></td></tr><tr><TD COLSPAN="2" BGCOLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="http://www.grizlorspics.iwarp.com/quotes/quote1b.gif"></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/uarameth7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arameth7th</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style=filter:glow(color=Green strength=5><font color=White face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Better Than Elessar</font></table></span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/02 7:52:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.cogeco.ca/~dominance/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Your First Day Of Playing Everquest (Share Your Stories!</span><hr size=1> Rolled a necro, don't know why - someone told me they were the most powerful class in the game.

Of course, like soooo many foolish first time players, I was lead to believe that my answer could be found in the form of a druid. So I got my druid to 7, felt dang uber, had a couple pieces of storebought leather armor and a rusty scimitar. Woot woot! Then server crashed and rolled back, leaving me with no good stuff anymore. Bleh.<br><br>Next character: friend says, 'Well, rangers are pretty good fighting and they have spells too'. Good deal, I thought. Made a ranger, got him to 5. Went playing in West Karana, got attacked by a lion, and just ran away. Another lion added on, I got stuck in a little pen thingy where animals should go (but NOT lions, darn it), and died. Could do CR.<br><br><br>Next character: human SK. Sounded cool. Got him up to 23 with an uber suit of Flayed Skin, a stalagterror spine spear, and a storebought round shield. Woot woot. Got bored of him a few times so played the next two characters in interim time.<br><br>Next character: bard. Was fun but I got bored.<br><br>Next character: monk. Ubah serp bracers. Yay. But he got wasted a lot so I quit him.<br><br>Around this time my friend of such wise suggestions told me to come to 7th Hammer (because he got someone's account password and stole his uber warrior gear - crafted and a charred guardian breastplate). He played that character and I started another, better, druid, by the name of Sinx (math = suk), and played him a while. Got him to 16 and had a little nest egg from uber bind moniez and SOW donations, so I made an SK, called him Eitsekur. Yay. Bronze helm from a passerby, some soft wicker, and later an almost full suit of Blackened Alloy armor from Ravenclaw (woot for ranger). And that was really my first day of EQ, because up until then all my days were sucky in comparison. <p><table width="294" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#000000" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" align="center">  <tr>     <td width="137" height="212"><img src="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/tele/_images/Eitsig001.jpg" width="137" height="296"></td>    <td width="147" valign="top" height="212">       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89448"><font color="#FF3300"><b><br>        <font color="#FF9900">Eitsekur</font></b></font></a><br>        Erudite Shadowknight<br>        Officer </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile?num=200637"><font color="#FF9900">Miktoffel</font></a>         <br>        Dark Elf Wizard<br>        Member</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><a href="http://mythrilmoon.tripod.com"><font color="#FF9900"><span class="unnamed1">Mythrilmoon         Mystics </span></font></a><br>        <br>        <br>        I</font><font size="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">         am the way into the city of woe<br>        I am the way to a forsaken people<br>        I am the way into eternal sorrow<br>        <br>        -Canto 3, <i>The Inferno<br>        </i></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"> Art         by<font color="#FF6600"> <a href="mailto:eitsekur@hotmail.com"><font color="#FF9900">Eitsekur</font></a></font></font></p>      </td>  </tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub43.ezboard.com/unullandvoyd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Null and Voyd       </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle> 1    Poster<BR><TABLE WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=7 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0><TR HEIGHT=5><TD WIDTH=2 BGCOLOR=#ffff00></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=2></TD></TR><TR HEIGHT=2><TD WIDTH=2 BGCOLOR=#000080></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#000080></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#000080></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15 BGCOLOR=#000080></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=1 BGCOLOR=#222222></TD><TD WIDTH=15></TD><TD WIDTH=2></TD></TR></TABLE></span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/18/02 1:05:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.xyzz.org/media/Jhonen_Vasquez/JTHM/gfx/covers/thumb_02_back.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Your First Day Of Playing Everquest (Share Your Stories!</span><hr size=1> My first character was a gnome wizard on RZ.

That coolness wore off after about 5 mins, and I switched to a Human.  That lasted until nightfall, and I found myself reincarnated as a dorf pally.  Got all the way to eigth level before I got sick of that, and rolled a half elf ranger.  The ranger thing just didn't work for me, and I had heard about how Druids were great at a number of different things, and whatnot and so Brenwyn the Wood Elf Druid was born.  Played her all the way to 54 before I deleted her and quit.

First day of playing Everquest.  <br><br>My roommate and I had borrowed a copy of beta 3 to play... and I created a wood elf bard.  I didn't understand about the clipping plane and I guess mine was set very low.  Of course I fell off the ramps at least once... <br><br>It was kinda funny.  I would move a few steps and then frantically bug my roommate with words like &quot;I'm lost!!  Where do I go?!  Which way is town?&quot;  Rinse and repeat every few steps.  Especially if I fought something.  I didn't want to lose sight of those guards!<br><br>Took a break to go to boot camp (for some reason they won't let you have a computer there much less play EQ =p )  and came back to start playing the real deal in November of 99.  I originally started a barbarian something or other, but got pissed off when I couldn't see well enough to get outta the tunnel.  I tried out a dark elf and was hopelessly lost in Neriak (wasn't until I got to my 4th dark elf that I learned Neriak.. all the others got deleted in frustration of not being able to get outta the city).  Finally I settled on the half elf ranger.  I got a few spells and a bow!  And in UO bows were badass... course EQ.. they didn't mean jack back then.  Played my ranger up to level 24 (and those were a hard earned 24 levels!) which is when I started a character on Xegony to play with some friends I had made along the way.<br><br> <p><B>Mdiria L'Soduire<BR><A HREF="http://eq.forgedsouls.org/">Forged Souls</A></B><BR><BR><I>Quote of the moment:</I><BR><IMG SRC="http://eq.forgedsouls.org/images/quote/randpic.php"></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=205.topic&start=21&stop=34>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=205.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=205.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=205.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.threadControl?topicID=205.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=205.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=205.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub43.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="7thhammerfrm11">Guild Links<option value="7thhammerfrm2">General<option value="7thhammerfrm3">Trade/Sale<option value="7thhammerfrm10">Raids<option value="7thhammerfrm5">Rants/Lamers<option value="7thhammerfrm12">Heroes/Thanks<option value="7thhammerfrm7">Polls<option value="7thhammerfrm9">Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/b7thhammer>Seventh Hammer</a><font color=#FFFFFF> -
