<br>
Folks, Benjamin Franklin said, &quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot; These words have been ringing in my head since Tuesday's program, which focused a large part on the cell phone ban made into law in New York.  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   It serves as a fascinating lesson on where we are in this nation, that under the umbrella of safety, Americans will willingly surrender their freedom. I don't know what the Founding Fathers would do if they were alive to see this. <br>
<br>
This kind of thinking is scary. It's like something out of science fiction where a totalitarian regime takes over your children and programs them. It got me to thinking about where this stuff comes from. <br>
<br>
I have a theory, and it's going to get me in trouble, but I'll offer it anyway. Men and women are different, and one of the areas in which men and women are different is in the area of thought and emotion. So, I just wondered aloud on Wednesday's program, &quot;What is the ratio of female to male teachers in our schools, grades K - 9?&quot; <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
  Well, the statistics came pouring in, and the preliminary findings were much as I expected: the majority of teachers are females, and since women emote more, and are governed by emotions, that might explain why we're creating generation after generation of touchy-feely, new-age feelers instead of objective thinkers. <br>
<br>
I know that I'm walking into quicksand by bringing this up. But according to figures from the National Education Association, 13% of elementary teachers are male. In Michigan, for instance, white males make up 29% of all teachers, but only 12% of elementary staff. So this is just the first wave of research we've done, but the point is made. You can make of it what you want, but we all know men and women are different, and we all know that when it comes to logic, men think women don't have any, and women think men don't feel enough. <br>
<br>
This is not earth shattering stuff, but it's an interesting theory. <br>
<br>
<br>
Taken from Rush Limbaughs' web page...<br>

<br>
Come on now!  Lets continue that thought.  If we take a poll of the sex ratio of High school and ollege professors, what would we come up with?  I'm guessing it would be the complete opposite.  Thus undoing all the &quot;touchy feely&quot; programming done by the elementary teachers.  This is total crap!  <br>
<br>
Men feel just as much as women.  We are just programmed to keep those emotions inside to seath away at us until we aggressively lash out.  Yeah that is healthy!<br>
<br>
So going on Rush's theory.  We need women to be more logical, and everyone less emotional?  CRAP!  I want to know where he and everyone else came up with the F$%^ed up idea that emotions are bad.  Logic is EXTREMELY important.  I am a very logical person.  I think that is something that is inherited and honed in high school and college.  I'm sorry but emotional release is a wonderful thing.  It allows for hotter passion.  More intense love!  More of a bonding to other people!  Now, tell me!  Are these things bad?<br>
<br>
I think not Rheaton.  And I think that Rush needs to doa  little more in the child development research.  My wife is a teacher(with a masters degree in child development).  When young, humans go through stages.  You, having children should have witnessed this, and they are very emotional from birth to some point when it is stifled.  I count myself lucky, being raised in an enviroment where my emotions were not stifled.  And I consider myself a good balance of logic and emotion.<br>
<br>
In summation:  Rush is still an idiot, and every time you qoute him that just makes me believe it that much more.<br>

I had to take issue with the cell phone law as well.  I think it is a good law, and no different than a speed law.  Or stop signs and signals.  It is a general public safety issue.  Of course, I'm sure that in his infinite wisdom, these are all bad laws as well, huh?<br>
<br>
Zort...<br>
<br>

<br>
My point exactly Zort.. &quot;Come on ppl....think!&quot;<br>
<br>
The idea that we are governed by a bunch of &quot;momma's boys&quot; is absurd.  I like to put Rush's quotes up here for the extreme right of things. Everything else is mainstream...<br>
<br>
Aside from all that emotional talk, i think the start of his little speech had alot of merit. Before there was talk about outlawing cell phone use while driving, a little study was conducted. It concluded that only 7% (out of 100%) auto accidents are cell phone related. This study was conducted by the supporters of the cell phone ban.  As you can imagine, the study was not used as a reinforcing argument for passage of the law.<br>
<br>
I must admit i use a cell phone while driving. I have never been in an accident while using my phone in any way, but i have done some  stupid stuff while using it (swerving, speeding). And i cant count how many times i have seen someone do something stupid while driving and using a cell phone. I know how we can fix it... make it a finable offense. That way we can all duck down under the dash while driving and the cops wont see us using our phones heheh.<br>
<br>
I think that the point Rush was trying to make...in his normal right wing flapping way...was... Why are we so willing to give up freedom for saftey? Granted there are many logical reasons depending on how one defineds freedom. But why fine a person for breaking the law?  Why not revoke thier drivers license for driving while using a cell phone? In Oklahoma, if you speed 5 to 10 over you get a fine... if its 11-25 over its a bigger fine.. and if your going way too fast you can loose your license. Basically put, &quot;slow&quot; speeding isnt as dangerous as very fast speeding in regards to safety. There is no &quot;non safe&quot; or &quot;more safe&quot; way to hold a phone to your ear while driving.<br>
<br>
Also in Oklahoma, we have a seat belt law. Many states now do. This out of all the (driving) laws upset me the most. I am not endangering anyone on the road if i am not wearing my seat belt....other then the insurance company's pocket books and myself. It was passed for &quot;safety&quot; reasons but its only a finable offense. Lets apply logic to that.<br>
<br>
Gun control: Lets make it a crime to own a gun because.....Beeeeecause  .. you could get mad and go shoot someone. (i know that not everyone whats to make it a crime..only 'regulate' them to non-existance).<br>
Oh no.. i didnt mean you, Mr. and Mrs. law abiding taxpayer.. no not you... you would never do anything like that.. we are talking about ..hmm.. confused and mixed up youths, the bad people and gangsters.<br>
And Heaven forbid your 3 y.o. son finds your loaded 44 Automag on the coffee table and shoots his little sister..cause we, the law makers, could have saved her..or at least fined you for having a gun.<br>
<br>
.. I dont take accidents like that lighty, thats why my guns are locked away and full instructions given &quot;Dont touch this ever&quot;. I give those instructions and my wife gives him the instructions of &quot;dont run with those scissors or knife in you hand&quot;.   dont stand outside in a lighting storm, dont stick metal things in a power outlet, dont touch the cleaners under the sink....dont ever play with these guns... <br>
<br>
&quot;But Rheaton, there are stupid people out there who dont teach their children as well as you and i dont want thier kid shooting mine!&quot;  Niether do i...  but i want to be able to shoot the kid's stupid father if he come in my house against my will (alot  ALOT more common then kid-gun accidents).<br>
<br>
Freedom or safety?  You pick... are you too scared to be free?<br>

I personally will never own one.  I keep a baseball bat next to my front door.  I'll take my chances with that.  I'd rather maim than kill.  ;^)  I could not live with myself if I ever took another person's life.  No matter the situation!  That is easy for me to say now.  But my beliefs go pretty deep on this subject, and I think I would feel that way, even under extreme duress.  That isn't to say I wouldn't beat him/her to within an inch of his/her life.<br>
<br>
These laws that you have a problem with:  Fortunately you can do something about it!  Vote in someone that will change them.  Simple to do right?  At least that is the theory.  It does seem silly to have laws governing common sense things like seat belts and cell phones, etc...  Such is the nature of the beast (our gov't).  They think they know what is best for us, so they impose those opinions (right or wrong) on us as they see fit.  We are responsible to keep them in check.  And I must say, the American Public does a pretty crappy job at that!!!!  We have pretty close to the lowest (if not the lowest) voter turnout of any democracy (republic).  That is where chnages need to be made.  I've walked the pricincts to sign people up to vote.  It is an important right/duty!<br>

<br>
Do to a lack in time..... this will be short [I hope]<br>
<br>
Crossing off the teacher distribution ratio from the list shaking my head... no need to even bring up that.<br>
<br>
Posting my quick views on the topics listed here and a maybe a few other controversial ones:<br>
<br>
Auto safety:<br>
     driver safety: I believe they should be the choice of the driver, and I believe that they should be practical for everyday use like they are for the most part now... but I dont think there should be a law requiring a seat belt....  I use a seat belt and locks.<br>
      passenger safety:   over 18 [adult] their choice, under required by law for seat belts and locks.....  IHMO... [yea  I hope conditioning will prevail for over 18]<br>
      Public safety:  anything that effect public safety should be considered to be made into a law as if takes the ... repercussions and choice from the person performing the act to others that have ot control over it.... laws like speeding, reckless driving, under the influence, vision, and YES people should be required to re-take their driving test every few years after the age of... insert old age here.....<br>
     as to cell phones... I wonder if the same was said of listening to the radio in the car, drinking a cup of water or better yet a HOT cup of coffee, having sex.... &gt;grin&lt;, and CELL PHONES.... I believe that it is ridicules to make up a law... that other laws cover... should we make up a specific law to say NO SEX while driving..... no I believe its covered under indecent exposure in public and RECKLASS DRIVING... there we go... any of the above can and should be categorized under reckless driving IF they are... if not   then there is not a reason to... well now we just spent... 80,000 government... no  scratch that.. OUR money to make a law for something that another law covers.  Aside from that I believe that HAND HELD cells phones can be dangerous... but that hands free are fine.. just like talking to someone in the car... just let technology catch up and it will solve it better then a law.<br>
<br>
Did I say this was going to be short???<br>
<br>
Guns:   it my constitutional right... sorry [not really sorry &gt;grin&lt;] my opinion, I'm a responsible person if i act irrasponcably then you have the right to take that away... until then... don't think so.... as to the people that ARE idiots….. Slam them hard... they give bad reputations to those that are... <br>
<br>
Voting:... participate... or don't complain... its ONE of the ways to change things... you may not get all u want   but then who does?... and there are those that GIVE to their community... if u cant give like they can    to help the community... then at least help them  to help the community.<br>
<br>
Abortion:   {shhhhh}   while a difficult choice... I believe it is the choice of the mother [66%] and the father [33%]... no   there wont be a tie... or the father saying you must do this... but I believe the mother.. whose body this is   has more validity to the outcome than the father... but the father should have some rights. I am Pro choice... I just find it sad that our society.. or family unity has suffered to the point of where we are now.<br>
<br>
Death penalty:   for it ……but it should be proven with DNA testing or something as definitive as that.... and get it done within 2 years… the death that is… and while we are at it … lets stop making country clubs [looking at my ex father in law, his bothers, sons, etc.] made different grads of prisons… but  know this.. They lost their rights when they committed a crime…:: looking at the world laws for prisoners…. Geneva convention was it that established those….??   Sounds like enough rights to me….. Should we try to help them lean new jobs and skills… sure… but it’s a gift… not a right.<br>
<br>
..... all in all I believe that <br>
<br>
1) Everyone take responsibility for yourself, your actions, and your responsibilities.<br>
<br>
2) take a active role in your children, and those around u.. in helping and showing them the basic principles of hard work, honesty, self assuredness, determination, and rewards.... a hard thing to say for me.<br>
<br>
3) speak up for your rights...and don't expect them to be protected by others... you must take pride and strength in yourself first.<br>
<br>
short???  kinda<br>
<br>
Be well all<br>
<br>
Always<br>

<br>
Although i do not subscribe the the &quot;It takes a village idiot to raise a village&quot; by Mrs. Clinton, I do think that we, as adults, do need to become more involved in our communities. It has to start a home.. then spread to the neighborhood...then out out out..<br>
   Starts by being the best parent you can be... or the best mentor or big brother...  Set examples, be honest and fair. Take responsibility for yourself and those in you care (when they do good and when they screw up).<br>
<br>
Abortion: A little boy pulls out his privates and shows his sister.. &quot;I got one of these and you don't&quot;. The sister shows her brother her privates and says &quot;Mom said that with one of these i can have as many of those as i want!&quot;<br>
<br>
A woman's body has more rights in this country then God. It is a personal decision i agree. A woman cannot be forced to love and want a baby when she really doesn't...*gulp* or isn't ready for it.<br>
A 15 year old girl has to have permission from her parents, this permission given to the school, for her to take an aspirin for a headache. However, a 13 year old girl can go to the councilor at school, tell them that she is preggy, an get the school to drive her down to the abortion clinic, get an federally funded &quot;operation&quot;, go back to school and her parents never notified at all...<br>
Recently in Okla., they passed a law stating that the surgeon is liable for related cost in case of a &quot;mishap&quot; during one of these &quot;secret&quot; abortions.<br>
  If we can get pregnant then have an abortion, why cant we clone humans?  Whats the difference, right? Make life if we want it..terminate a living thing if we don't want it.  Who owns the clone, the sperm or the egg donor?...guess it might depend on who did the most work...prolly the female if she carried it in her body.... or the bank where you financed it through...until paid in full.<br>
...and some say there really isn't a moral issue here heheh... cha right.<br>
<br>
Gonna mix up the pot here a little bit..<br>
   The above ramblings of yours truly are to make a point. What side of our brain are we using to make laws? What judgements are used to conclude the balance of fair and not fair?  Should somewhere in the law making process there be morals injected? Whos morals...what morals?<br>
<br>
<br>
*holds up a sign* &quot;I AM!......nothing without God&quot;<br>
<br>
*slips from the soapbox*  Ouch!  guess mah time if finished here<br>

<br>
Now for the ramblings of a bafoon.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I can't find a whole lot here to disagree with.  Dagnabit, we need Tryton back!  Let me dig deep though.<br>
<br>
Auto saftey:  everyone is making sense for a change ('cept for Rush of course)<br>
<br>
Guns:  Yeah it is your constitutional right.  Enjoy it.  Have all the guns you want.  But please keep them away from me and mine and your own children!<br>
<br>
Voting:  Duh, why else would we be in this forum if we didn't believe this to be an important responsibility.<br>
<br>
Abortion:  Though I would never approve of one in my family, I am pro-choice.  But, NOT as a means of birth control!  But where do we step in and take away a woman's constitutional rights and say they cannot get pregnant, or take control of her body by saying she cannot have an abortion.  Eventually a doctor must step in and make a moral decision to not perform the operation.  Only to have her go down the street to another clinic.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br>
<br>
Death Penalty:  Well... I used to be all for it.  Only because life in prison doesn't always mean life.  I still belive that it should mean life, and then the death penalty should be abolished.  Until then, yes the death penalty is the right way to go, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
My religion touts personal responsibility above all other values.  So, yeah even the tough stuff to swallow needs to be owned up to.  As parents, as members of the community, as individuals.  We are responsible for the world in which we live.  We are it's caretakers.  And it is going to be only as good as we make it.<br>
<br>
&lt;steps down from the soapbox to give another a turn&gt;<br>
