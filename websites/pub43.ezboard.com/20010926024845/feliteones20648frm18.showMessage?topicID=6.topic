Solomen is a<br>
human wizard located on the left portion of the temple, third floor, between the two undead<br>
knights, one room away from Lord Seafire. The end result of the quest is not known, but it is<br>
thought to be a blunt sceptre type weapon with fantastic stats as well as unique particle effects<br>
when held. This is the mother of all wizard quests.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Solomen'<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'Ah, I see you have found my study. This is where I study and scribe the history of<br>
magic in Norrath.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what history?'<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'I have worked to chronicle everything from the beginnings of magic to what we<br>
consider the modern day of magic. Solusek Ro has been very generous to those who wield<br>
magic in Norrath. But throughout history there is one thing I have noticed - too much power<br>
corrupts the soul. I have seen and documented that the strongest wizards and those closest to<br>
Solusek Ro become corrupted by their power.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what wizards?'<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'Unfortunately, I don't have time to speak of such things right now. But I could use<br>
your help since you are here. I have here an envelope that I need delivered to one Camin Rah.<br>
You can find Camin in the wizard tower in the city of Erudin. He is a sage like myself whose<br>
knowledge rivals my own. Do you [agree] to undertake my task? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I agree.'<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'Here you are, then. Good luck on your journey.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Solomen hands you a note that you must give to Camin. Now the real quest begins!<br>
<br>
Jump to:<br>
<br>
Camin Beginning <br>
Dargon in Halas <br>
Handing Camin Ro's Breath <br>
Handing Dargon the Empty Ro's Breath <br>
Challice and the Ring <br>
Returning the Ring to Arantir <br>
The Gnome - Kandin Firepot <br>

Broken Golem (new way) <br>
Taking Kandin's Note to Arantir <br>
The End with Solomen <br>
<br>
Camin can be found at the Vasty Deep Inn within Erudin. To find him inside the Inn,<br>
open the front door to the Inn and go up the stairs on your right. Follow the hallway<br>
around the second floor and Camin is found behind the first door upon your left. Off<br>
the bat, he is normally indifferent or apprehensive to everyone. Hand him the note<br>
that was given to you by Soloman and you will receive positive TrueSpirit faction.<br>
(Note: Since the patch on 10/03/00, you can no longer keep handing Camin the<br>
note and gain faction.. it has been nerfed)<br>
<br>
Camin will now reply with -<br>
<br>
Camin says, 'So you have met Solomen, eh? He is a man with a<br>
wealth of knowledge. It is good to hear he is well.<br>
<br>
Now hail Camin and he will respond with this -<br>
<br>
Camin says 'Go away! I have no time for you! <br>
<br>
If this happens, you can continue with the quest. (Note: Since the patch on<br>
10/03/00, you can no longer keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. it<br>
has been nerfed). <br>
<br>
If you have good faction already, you can talk to Camin: <br>
<br>
you say, 'What are you searching for?'<br>
Camin says 'Ah! A smart one, I see! If you really wish to know about<br>
such a thing, you will have to help me finance my studies. The<br>
knowledge I have acquired and researched did not come cheaply.<br>
<br>
At this point, hand Camin 1000 platinum and the quest will continue. Some have even<br>
reported this as working while being apprehensive to him (confirmed you must do<br>
this part of the quest or the next part will result in &quot;I do not do business with<br>
your kind.&quot;). Doing this will make Camin reply with:<br>
<br>
Camin says, 'Good, good, you show a willingness to learn of this with<br>
your offer. What I can tell you is that Solusek Ro had four followers<br>
who had shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of wizardry. Solusek Ro<br>
himself tutored them. He considered them to be like his own children. I<br>
know of one who still exists. He goes by the name of Arantir Karondor.<br>
He used to specialize in the storing of magic into physical objects.<br>
Arantir has been hiding for many, many years and will most assuredly<br>
be going by another name, so keep your eyes open. Anyway, be off, I<br>
need to continue my research. Return to me if you ever find Arantir<br>
Karondor.'<br>
<br>
Now to find Arantir Karondor. I honestly have no idea what Verant was thinking<br>
when they did this part of the quest. There are zero clues as to who or where this<br>
person is and honestly, it's sort of disturbing to me that every other class' quest is<br>
straightforward, but still has a very good degree of difficulty. None the less, there is a<br>
female NPC vendor in Halas named 'Dargon' that sells a potion called Ro's Breath.<br>
She is located in front of the Shaman guild. Purchase this potion from Dargon for the<br>
sum of about 900pp to 1100pp depending on your faction and charisma. (**evil<br>
races be warned - you ARE KOS to surrounding NPC's. See this page for Halas<br>
Guard and Vendor info**). There is also three other known vendors in the world<br>
that sell Ro's Breath -<br>
<br>
Female Barbarian, Marlyn McMerin (loc -3825, +1665), who is found on the<br>
dock shops in Fironia Vie. <br>
Female Iksar shaman vendor, Klok Scaleroot in West Cabilis. <br>
Female coldain dwarf, Hudda, who is found within the bank inside the city of<br>
Thurgadin. <br>
<br>
You can buy Ro's Breath from any of these vendors but you cannot return it to them.<br>
Neither of them will turn into Arantir. However, it is confirmed that you can buy Ro's<br>
Breath them, take it to Camin to be stripped of it's charge, and then take it to<br>
Dargon. Handing this potion to Dargon in Halas will make her turn into Arantir and<br>
the quest will continue.<br>
<br>
Now take this potion back to Camin in Erudin and hand it to him. He will reply with<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
Camin says 'Very interesting... I've seen this work before. Yes, yes!<br>
It's the work of Arantir Karondor! Give this back to the person you got<br>
it from. Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's location.' <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Camin gives you back the potion (it has now been stripped of it's Shield of Lava<br>
charge) and you must take it back to Dargon in Halas.<br>
Note: you cannot skip the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must hand<br>
the potion to Camin. If you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will get the<br>
following message from Dargon: &quot;I didnt request this item, but thank you very<br>
much&quot;.<br>
<br>
Back in Halas, hand the Ro's Breath potion back to Dargon. She will turn into blue<br>
robe adorned, Arantir Karondor and reply with:<br>
<br>
Dargon says 'So, I've been discovered! You must know Camin - he is<br>
one of the only people who could have recognized my work. I have<br>
worked very hard to mask my presence here.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor' <br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Before I tell you anything, I require you to<br>
help me. Seek a woman named Challice. Give her this letter and then<br>
return to me.'<br>
<br>
The letter that Arantir hands you is actually a ring called Arantir's Ring. Identifying it<br>
reveals: &quot;Item Lore: My love has no bounds.&quot; Challice is found in the basement of the<br>
Felwithe paladin guild. NOTE: Keep in mind that Arantir will despawn in three<br>
minutes. So if you want to keep him there while you run to Felwithe, have a<br>
friend stay with Arantir and continue to talk to him until you return. It has also<br>
been noted that even trying to keep Arantir spawned by talking to him will not<br>
work for he will sometimes despawn regardless. If this happens, you must<br>
respawn him with another stripped Ro's Breath or wait for another wizard to do<br>
so. Hand Challice the ring and she will reply with:<br>
<br>
Challice says 'Oh yes? Arantir? What a fool he was! the man gave me<br>
everything, but for all his intelligence, he could never understand why I<br>
was truly with him. It was for his power; he could do anything. But<br>
when he mysteriously lost it, he became just another toy. I never loved<br>
him. Return this ring to him. He will understand that I have no desire to<br>
see him again.' <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
This new ring, when indentified reads: &quot;Item Lore: I never could love a man like you.&quot;<br>
Take this ring back to Arantir and hand it over (WARNING: You cannot hand the<br>
ring to Dargon if Arantir has despawned. You must hand it to Arantir. Arantir<br>
despawns about 3 minutes after speaking to him the first time so you must<br>
either be quick, wait for another wizard to make him spawn, or have a friend<br>
stay with Arantir and continue to speak to him - keeping him spawned). Then<br>
you must hail him to get his attention and go through the following dialogue:<br>
<br>
you say, 'Hail Arantir Karondor!'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Ah, but it pains my heart to see this. How I<br>
could love a women like that is beyond me. And yet, I still do love her.<br>
It was on the day I was to ask her to marry me that I lost my powers.<br>
When I was about to cast my greatest spell to prove my love to her, my<br>
magic failed. She ran out on me that day. But enough of me, do you<br>
wish to hear my story?' <br>
<br>
you say, 'I wish to hear your story.'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'I once was one of four true followers of<br>
Solusek Ro. So great were the four of us that Solusek Ro himself made<br>
us each a special item. We did not know what the others' items were,<br>
but we realized that was for our own safety. Each one of us, after<br>
receiving the item, began to plot against Solusek Ro. Each of us<br>
believed we had enough power to dominate Norrath. Solusek Ro saw<br>
this and at the time we needed our powers most, he stripped us of<br>
them. Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One was called<br>
Sylen Tyrn, the other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard was a<br>
gnome, but I can't think of his name.<br>
<br>
you say, 'What about Sylen Tyrn?'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Sylen was a high elf wizard, and like many<br>
high elves, he believed himself to be better than others. Because of his<br>
birth, he thought he was more noble and more intelligent than anyone<br>
else. I heard how met his demise - while flying over a vast area of<br>
water, his powers were stripped from him in midflight. He fell and was<br>
captured by a rival wizard who specialized in magics of the water.<br>
Search for that wizard and you could find a trace of Sylen.<br>
<br>
The 'trace' of Sylen Tyrn is found off of Phiningel Autropos deep in Kedge Keep -<br>
the Blue Crystal Staff. When this item is identified, the power of Solusek Ro radiates<br>
from within.<br>
<br>
you say, 'What about Demunir Scry?'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Demunir was a human in a rush for power.<br>
He was extremely intelligent and resourceful but, unfortunately, was<br>
more interested in destructive magic. Hearing of an ancient land, he<br>
immediately traveled to it, believing there to be powerful relics left<br>
undiscovered there. While exploring, he came upon a dwelling that<br>
housed a powerful warrior. Believing himself to be more powerful, he<br>
attempted to take this dwelling for himself. While in battle with this<br>
warrior, Solusek Ro stole his powers and left him helpless. It is said that<br>
Demunir's item is the warrior's most prized trophy.<br>
<br>
The Demunir item is the Gnarled Staff found off of Venril Sathir from within Karnor's<br>
Castle.<br>
<br>
you say, 'What about the gnome?'<br>
if he doesn't reply, say the following..<br>
you say, 'Who is the gnome?'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Ah, the gnome I know very little about. I<br>
know he was small and crafty, and that he had a brother. His brother's<br>
craft was that of making fireworks, and he was the unfortunate victim of<br>
one of his own experiments. His firework exploded, leaving his mind<br>
diminished in capacity, even for a gnome. I remember others calling him<br>
'Old Stewpot' in jest. I do not know if this is his birth name, but it may<br>
help you to locate him. I hear he also stays close to water because of<br>
the explosion. You never know when another gnomish invention will go<br>
awry. Give him this letter to help motivate him to remember. <br>
<br>
The gnome is Kandin Firepot. Kandin can be found in the Southwest region of<br>
ButcherBlock Mountains (-1500 +2800) near the ocean. You can hand him the note<br>
from Arantir and he will give you the text below:<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Brother! I have one of those. He's great, but<br>
he's dead. His name was Gabstik and he was a really powerful wizard.<br>
I still have one of his greatest possesions! You look like you could use<br>
it. I've added another thing to my shopping list. I require a dry brittle<br>
skin that I can mold or a rare oil found in the planes that I can soak the<br>
fuse in. Get me one of these things and I'll trade it for my bother's stick.'<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
<br>
You can do this part of the quest two ways now but it is easier to do it the new way<br>
(thank you Verant for realizing our epic quest was nearly impossible).<br>
<br>
THE FIRST WAY (the hard way) -<br>
<br>
If you have happen to have Cazic's Skin from Cazic Thule in Fear (some may have<br>
the skin from before the patch), you can hand it to Kandin and he will reply with the<br>
following -<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Great! This is? What is this for again? Oh yeah,<br>
the casing for my firework. Here, you can have this then, oh no, wait.<br>
You can't yet. I forgot I needed another part to my firework, and you<br>
are exactly the person to get it for me! I need some mistletoe powder.<br>
Now, go find some for me! Go, go, go, go! Shoo! Oh, wait! Hold on to<br>
my bag for me, please. You can give it back after you've given me what<br>
I want.<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
<br>
At this point, Kandin Firepot will give you 'Kandin's Bag'. When identified, the bag<br>
comes up with: Item Lore: Warning - Explosive!&quot;. Although it is a bag, it cannot be<br>
opened. Don't worry about this, continue with the quest.<br>
<br>
The mistletoe powder is found within Old Sebilis upon Tolapmulj. Once you have the<br>
powder, return to Kandin and hand only the powder to him. Upon handing Kandin<br>
the mistletoe powder, he will return to you the Staff of Gabstik. Once he hands you<br>
the staff he asks for his bag back. Hand him 'Kandin's Bag' -<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Great! Give this to Arantir so he knows you've<br>
helped me! Hey! Have you seen my lantern anywhere? <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
<br>
THE SECOND WAY (the new way) -<br>
<br>
If you hail Kandin instead of handing him the skin, the following is what will happen -<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Kandin Firepot'<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm<br>
workin', workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil! <br>
<br>
You say, 'what oil?'<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Ah the oil! I recently sent a specially crafted<br>
golem to explore through a huge portal to another plane. It's instructions<br>
were to collect special oil that I suspect existed in the plane. What I<br>
think is the golem broke down. This looks like a good task for one like<br>
you. Go see what's wrong with the golem. Here is spare gears of mine<br>
incase it's broken. Be careful though, if you put it in wrong it could<br>
explode or worse! <br>
<br>
This golem is a non-aggro 'broken golem' that is found in the Plane of Fear (-720,<br>
-109). Hand the broken golem the golem sprocket -<br>
<br>
an enraged golem says 'Error! Malfunction! Destroy! <br>
an enraged golem says 'Warriors like you always bring out the worst in<br>
me.'<br>
<br>
You now have an enraged golem on your hands that is aggro. The enraged golem can<br>
double hit for 400 each, has approximately 150k HP and is not a caster. Flame<br>
based spells and lures are most efficient to use in bringing him down. Once he is<br>
dead, loot the green oil from his corpse. Take this green oil back to Kandin in the<br>
ButcherBlock Mountains.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Kandin Firepot'<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm workin',<br>
workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil!<br>
<br>
Hand over the oil -<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Oh wow! You found the oil! Where is the golem?<br>
You didn't hurt him did you? I am very fond of him. Anyways, here is<br>
your reward a note and staff to give to that guy you were asking me<br>
about. <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
<br>
You will now have BOTH the note to take to Arantir and the Staff of Gabstik.<br>
<br>
Now take this note from Kandin and give it to Arantir. This is where things go weird.<br>
Occy, the wizard that first completed this quest, took the note to Arantir and handed<br>
it to him. Upon handing it to Arantir, nothing happened. No item handed back to<br>
Occy, no words spoken by Arantir... nothing. Needless to say, Occy just about<br>
cr*pped himself. All Occy heard was the experience 'chime'. Then Occy hailed<br>
Arantir after he handed in the note.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor' <br>
<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Ah yes, you again. Do you have the items?<br>
Give me the three you possess and I'll combine them with my own.<br>
<br>
At this point, hand Arantir all three staves, the Blue Crystal Staff, the Gnarled Staff,<br>
and the Staff of Gabstik. <br>
<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Here, this pack contains all of our items. You<br>
will never be able to open it again, so you must deliver the pack, intact,<br>
to Solomen. He will then reward you. Now that I have helped you,<br>
leave me in peace.<br>
<br>
Now you must go back to Solomen and hand him this pack. Upon doing so will<br>
result in getting the epic item, Staff of the Four.<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'You actually did it! I never would have thought that<br>
anyone could have truly followed this path. This is a tribute to your<br>
intelligence and patience. Here, take this staff and know that you have<br>
made Solusek Ro and all the wizards of the world proud this day. <br>
