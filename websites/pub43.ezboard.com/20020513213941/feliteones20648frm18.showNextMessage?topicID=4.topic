He is located in the Undead pyramid city near the teleport areas. He was inside the far west pyramid, location was positive 770, positive 9700. (Thanks Talespin Spellwind for location.) Baldric Slezaf will ask you for four items. They are the top part of page 24, the bottom part of page 24, page 25, and a Lute made by Forper Fizfla.<br><br>Top half of page 24<br><br>The quest for the top part of page 24 starts in Western Karanas, where you must find Konia Swiftfoot in the guard tower -516 , -2433. He will tell you to take a torch to Fajio Knejo. Fajio can be found in Misty Thicket at approximately -250, -250. This is on the safe side of the wall close to the entrance to the dangerous side where the two guards are stationed. Give him the torch and he will give you another torch to take to Andad Filla. (Kind of like the Olympics.)<br><br>Fajio says: 'Run Onwart, my friend, to the far off Desert of Ro and give this torch to Andad Filla.<br><br>Andad Filla is in South Ro -3043 , +1243. He spawns and sits very near to the Innothule Swamp entrance and when you give him the torch from Fajio he will give you yet another torch to give to Misty Tekchita. <br><br>Andad says: You still have a way to go! Seek out Misty Tekchita near the arena at Lake Rathe. Run like the wind!<br><br>Misty is in Lake Rathetear. If she is there when you get there you can find her near the entrance to the Arena. Misty will give you a Ring called Proof of Speed. Return this ring to Konia Swiftfoot and you will get the top part of page 24.<br><br>bottom half of page 24<br><br>For the bottom half of page 24, Konia Swiftfoot will give it to you for Mahlin's Bongos. To get these, first visit Braenar Swiftsong in South Karanas at -19 , +96. Asked him &quot;what doll&quot; and he will give you a Solusek Mining Company Invoice. Take the Invoice to Marfen Binkdirple and he will give you A Mechanical Doll. Give this doll to Braenar's Daughter, Serra. She is in the Estate of Unrest next to the Gnome Spelunker on the right on the mansion. You will need a enchanter to mesmerize the spelunker or a group to kill him. Serra will give you a note to give to Braenar. He will give you another not to give to Maligar. <br><br>Maligar is found in West Karanas at approximately +1300 , -11500. He is KoS to mostly everyone. When you give him a note Maligar's Estranged Doppleganger will spawn on top of him. You must then kill both of these things and loot from the Doppleganger Maligar's Head. To kill these two you will only need a group of high 40's to low 50's. <br><br>Take Maligar's Head to Braenar and he will give you Mahlin's Bongos. Take the Bongo's to Konia for the bottom half of page 24.<br><br>page 25<br><br>Now to find page 25. First talk to Kelkin Mekia, a female npc in South Karanas. She asks you to bring her 3 guts for 3 dragons. The first guts drops from Eldrig the Old. He is a rare spawn drake in Skyfire Mountains. Its drops Chromodrac guts which are the guts you need. <br><br>The next guts are dropped from Nezekezena, a named dragon level 51 in the Burning Woods. Reports indicate that if you go to Nezekezena's spawn location (about -450, -2550 in Burning Wood) and kill everything in sight, eventually Nez or his (her?) placeholders will start spawning with a cycle time of 90 seconds. People have evidenced acquiring Burning Embers at a rate of 1 or 2 in a few hours' time with this method. Phurzikan and Nezekezna both spawn on this spot, and they are both strong; sometimes Nez or Phurz will spawn two times in a row, so your group had better be strong enough to take them. Nezekezena, if not killed when she spawns, will wander sometimes along the east and south walls of the zone, so if you can't find her near her spawn, look there. A tracker would definitely help. The guts you need from her are red wurm guts.<br><br>The last guts are dropped from Blackwing in Rathe Mountains. This is a level 35-40 dragon identical to the other drakes. To get him to spawn, kill all lizards, drakes, etc. that are close to the sphinx. He will spawn shortly. He has around 1400-1900 hitpoints. He drops huge onyx drake guts.<br><br>Take the three guts to Kelkin Mekia and she will give you page 25.<br><br>head and neck of the mystical lute<br><br>Now for the final part. You must get talk to Forpar Fizfla. You must complete three quests for him. After each quest he will reward you will part of the flute. He can usually be found in the middle windmill.<br><br>The First Quest is for the Head and Neck of the lute. Go to Vedico Windwisper in the Butcherblock Mountains. She is on the docks. She asks that you bring the Alluring Horn. This horn is dropped off of Quag Maelstrom. He is a level 45 mob in Ocean of Tears, only one zone away from Vedico. The following information was cited by an anonymous person on Illia's Beastiary. He's generally on the Seafury Cyclops island around -6000, 1000. He conned red to me at 42 and he casts drain mana a lot, (which curiously did not appear to lower my bardic mana bar at all). I was able to land a lot of Chants of Flame and Curtailing Chants so his fire/magic resistances may not be that high. He didn't hit me all that much, but if memory serves he was hitting me for around 100 or 120 per shot. He's generally seen wielding this odd weapon which looks like a thin tree trunk skewering the alluring horn he carries, which tends to make him stand out from the others. There are a good number of cyclopses on the small island, so pulling Quag alone isn't easy. But sometimes he stomps over to the shore by himself (to look in the water I guess). I don't know if he spawns all the time, or if you have to trigger his spawn by talking to the disgruntled elf at the BB docks. I went to talk to the elf first just in case, and by the time I got to the island Quag was there, and didn't despawn over the several hours I took to gauge the island and set up my offensive.<br><br>Bring the Alluring Horn to Vedico and she will give you a note to give to give to Forpar. When you give the note to Forpar he offer to give to the head and neck of the lute if you give him three things.<br><br>The first thing is called Backbone of an Ancient Fisherman or Phinigel's Spine. It is found off of the Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep. The Phinigel Autropos is a very hard level 50 Wizard. He can be taken out by around 2-3 groups that work well together. He enjoys dispelling people (usually your enduring breath.) He is also very difficult to kill because he is guarded by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well. (Level Needed)<br><br>The second thing is a Amalgym Tentacle or Amalgym Tendril. These are 9/25 1h slashing weapons that drop from Amalgym Warriors and Knights in Plane of Fear. They are both level 48-52 but the knights can heal, summon pets, and harmtouch.<br><br>The third thing is a Petrified Skull of Lycanthrope or petrified werewolf skull. This is dropped from the Drolvarg Warlord in Karnor's Castle. This is a level 51-54 Drolvarg who spawns in the Warlord room.<br><br>Hand in the three items to Forpar and he will give you the head and neck of the lute.<br><br>strings of the mystical lute<br><br>Once you get the body, Forpar will offer to give you the strings to the lute as long as you bring him one thing. Trakanon's Guts. These drop off of a clone of Trakanon. He is exactly the same except he always drops the guts. To get him to spawn, go to Trak's lair while he is not spawned. Give the body of the lute to An Undead Bard. He will hand it back to you and then attack you. He is level 55 monster. Once he is killed, the clone of Trakanon will spawn. Trakanon claws for 650, with a sickening melee range, and his breath attack has been known to kill whole groups in minutes. Reports say that the regular Trakanon doesn't drop the guts. You have to kill him this way but this has not yet been confirmed. Turn the guts AND the head, neck, body of the lute, and the note he gives you, for the entire mystical lute.<br><br>The end<br><br>You are nearly there! Go back to the Dreadlands and find Baldric. Give him Maestro's Symphony Page 24 Top, Maestro's Symphony Page 24 Bottom, Page 25, Mystical Lute. He will give you the Singing Short Sword!<br><br>Swinging Short Sword <br><br>1hs 16 dmg 26 delay<br>str 15 dex 10 sta 10 cha 15 hp 50 mana 10 svf 10 svc 10 svm 10 svd 10 svp 10 effect dance of the blade<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p>Derric Tethyr <BR>Master of the Dark Arts <BR>"Death is but a doorway to a whole new world" <BR><img src=http://www.webdeveloper.com/animations/bnifiles/hjm_animdragon.gif></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/feliteones20648frm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/feliteones20648frm18.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/feliteones20648frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/feliteones20648frm18.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/feliteones20648frm18.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/feliteones20648frm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/feliteones20648frm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub43.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eliteones20648frm1">Guild News<option value="eliteones20648frm11">Raids and Stuff<option value="eliteones20648frm12">Guild Invites<option value="eliteones20648frm8">Name Yourself<option value="eliteones20648frm15">Skills and Crafts<option value="eliteones20648frm18">Quest Information<option value="eliteones20648frm13">EMAILS<option value="eliteones20648frm5">Humor!!!<option value="eliteones20648frm19">Music and Movies!<option value="eliteones20648frm6">Stories<option value="eliteones20648frm9">Political Forum<option value="eliteones20648frm16">The Sand Box<option value="eliteones20648frm7">Orgys and Stuff<option value="eliteones20648frm17">Council Chambers<option value="eliteones20648frm20">Item/Equipment needs<option value="eliteones20648frm21">Guild Bank</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#D6CDA3>- </font><a href=http://pub43.ezboard.com/beliteones20648>~ Unbroken Honor ~</a><font color=#D6CDA3> -
