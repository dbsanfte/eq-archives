<br>
The Ceremony<br>
<br>
“Forever I will be here with you…forever in your hearts.” Those words will live with me till the day I die. My name is Reese and I have been playing this consuming game for over two years now…EverQuest is its name. I have through my many hours spent and and freedoms bound, managed to bring a High Elf Magician to a level of 41 when this was written. I am apart of a guild on a server that both will remain anonymous as I profess this legend, this myth…this haunting.<br>
        I joined this guild about one year ago last week. For those of you not too familiar with what a guild is I will give a brief summary.<br>
It is a group of people baring common interest who come together as friends, brothers and sisters, wives and husbands, the young and the old. They join so they can fight together, gain together and die together. It’s a union of souls projected as pixels and bits with a keyboard as your only ability to communicate.<br>
<br>
When I joined the guild there were many I did not know. Many were kind, some silly, some diligent…we have a little of every good world here…minus one…minus a very good friend of mine. Maxus Millennium was one of the first players in the guild that took me in and showed me around. He was patient and calm as I stumbled my way through zone to zone and all my many questions …some game related…some guild related. He was always there for me when I or anyone ever needed him for something done, someplace raided and he never asked for anything in return. He was the quite type that never had too much to say but when he did speak only a soft, kind-hearted person would show through as you read and hung on to every word he typed. Everyone in the guild liked him and he they. He was that guy that you always wanted in your group, knowing he would do his job and do it very well. Never looted, never complained …a great guy and friend indeed.<br>
<br>
Three months to the day has passed since The Ceremony that changed our lives forever. I had logged in on a Tuesday night at about 7:10pm when I started reading the guild chat which told of a tragic accident. “Who? What? What is going on?” I inquired of the guild only to have my heart torn to shreds by what I read next. “One of our brothers-in-arms has fallin” the guild leader told me. “Who?” I asked. “Maxmini…he died last night in a car accident…”. I melted in my chair. It seems that after a late night at work on his way home down that dark highway he struck a stalled car in the far right lane. The stalled car wasn’t able to make it to the side of the road in time before it came to a complete stop. It was there for sometime and the battery that ran the hazard lights was dead. He either dozed off or looked down for a moment …we don’t know. There weren’t any skid marks at all…he just never seen it. Yeah, he was wearing a seatbelt and the airbags deployed but 80mph is just too damn fast for anyone to survive.<br>
<br>
        The guild had taken up a donation to send to his widow and 2 young children…we felt it was the least we could do for her letting us have him each night…letting this great man walk with us.<br>
We had all agreed that we needed to do something to honor him and to bring closure to his character…closure wasn’t what we got at all.<br>
One of the guild officers, which knew him in RL, had arranged a phone conversation with the widow for her assistance in the ceremony. That night we went too far…we crossed the line somewhere and where I don’t know but our hearts where in the right place…I just don’t know.<br>
The officer instructed her, someone who never touched the game at all, click by click…button by button. Her and a few escorts including the officer lead Maxmini’s body to the Freeport bank were she was instructed to destroy everything he had in there. From there a TP was given to NK… I remember her faint typings of “This is hard…I don’t understand why we are doing this…” I could just imagine her small little trembling hands shaking as her weak voice came through the phone line. The officer said it was like “..a constant heart break with every minute I talked to her…she would cry then try to be happy…then cry some more..”. <br>
She was instructed step by step as they walked Maxus’s body through each zone till they reached the Arena. Once there she was told to take him to the direct middle and all formed a circle around him. And again she was instructed to remove all spells mem’d…destroy everything in his inventory …Then to remove every article on his being and destroy that. He stood there naked and silent and this time there were no jokes…..not even one word was typed…dead silence fell over the zone.<br>
The next thing was the hardest by far and has scared me the most. After accepting the challenge to duel from the guild leader there was nothing more for the widow to do but sit and watch. “We have come here today to say goodbye to our brother. To bring closure to his name in our hearts…..” We all listened but nothing we could hear could prepare us for what we knew we had to do next. All the casters in the group gathered around him in a smaller circle and were awaiting the word. “Hail to Maxmini! May your soul remain alive here and in us for all time” That was the signal...that was the call for all the casters to lay him down. I could barley click my spell button, my hands were shaking and the tears were streaming down my face...When the blasts hit his body he shook and trembled, wobbling back and forth…all his life line was gone but he didn’t fall till his eyes closed and he let out a scream like never before heard. There he laid on the ground but not in the typical half fetal position but face down, arms out….There were 12 screenshots taken that night and none of them show what we saw. “It will take you to another screen in a moment once the ‘Loading, please wait..’ message is gone” the officer to the widow.. “It isn’t changing at all…I mean there isn’t any text and its like I am floating above him as he is laying there…” she reported.<br>
I’m not sure how long a level 38’s corpse is to remain in the game after a death but I would say longer then 3 and a half minutes…..it, his corpse, was gone. We later found out that the next month his wife received a letter from everquest saying “We are sorry you closed your account with us. Please feel free to join back with our easy online…” blah blah.. She said she had never canceled the account.<br>
It was one late evening when a friend of mine and I were camping Gnolls at the north spire in SK. A Monday and there wasn’t but 6 people in zone, most of which were passing though I’m sure. <br>
I do not know where they all came from and how why there were so many of them but a mass of gnolls piled out from the Paw entrance and came running straight at us. We knew for sure that we were dead. They arrived at us and started killing us fast and hard.. then a blast I had never seen before…a spell that just isn’t in the game laid waist to 18 gnolls… I was stunned. I had never seen such a rainbow of graphics and intense area it covered. “GM event I guess..” I though to myself as I did a “/” to get a report of who all was in zone, but now there where only 3 in the zone. I, my friend and a anonymous with no name. Having see invis cast on myself and my friend for use of the air pet did not provide any answers either. There just wasn’t a soul..or should I say…a person around. “Hail!” I sent forth into the empty zone…a brief pause, the shuffling of feet from someone unseen then what sounded like someone sitting to med right next to me. My heart raced as I remembered The Ceremony and what happened that night. “Who is there? What kinda magic is that?” deathly sill and quite everything was when it spoke… “I have been watching you two for sometime now. You are doing very well”. “Who is there!” I demanded as fear coursed through me. “A friend….I am here to help you when you need me”… the typing did not have a name next to it…it was only the words he said. “How do I know you’re a friend if I cant see you or even know your name?” I inquired. Then it told a tell that made my blood run as cold as ice...“…I gave up a good part of my life to this game and my soul to, and your funeral for me has me trapped here. I cannot leave, I cannot die, I cant not camp and log out. There is no /q…there is no keyboard. I cant leave this place and I want to now. I want my life in the sun and I want to work everyday…. My heart aches every minute to see my wife and children but yet all I see is death here. You two are my friends but the love in my soul has escaped me and I search for it constantly as I forever roam these lands. Hoping and praying for a small tear in a wall for me to slip out of but never finding one…there is no way out. I must go now but know this…. Forever I will be here with you…forever in your hearts”<br>
“But wait!” I shouted, but it was too late for I heard him get up and run off.<br>
<br>
He is here…he is with us. <br>
So if you ever hear those ghostly foot steps or perhaps something comes and sits down beside you…something you cannot see, send out a “Hail!”…you never know who may be there with you…keeping you company…you keeping him company.<br>
