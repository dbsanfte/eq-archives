She's already doing it on &quot;Today.&quot; <br>
<br>
Yesterday morning, for instance, at the end of a taped interview with the mother and brother of confessed child murderer Andrea Yates, Couric told viewers where to send contributions to the Texas woman's defense fund; the address also appeared onscreen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any money left over will be given to women's charities dealing with postpartum depression and psychosis,&quot; added Couric, who is arguably the most influential journalist in America today. Heck, she persuaded hordes of Americans to get colonoscopies simply by having her own, on-air, in March 2000. Couric's National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance, formally launched that same month, raised more than $10 million in just a few weeks, the Associated Press reported. Which is why most major media companies, including Viacom and AOL Time Warner, reportedly are courting Couric to headline news programs or talk shows, as her NBC News contract comes up for renewal.<br>
<br>
Couric gave the detailed information about the defense fund -- which was set up late last week -- right after Yates's mother and brother told NBC News correspondent Jim Cummins that they need help paying the legal bills.<br>
<br>
&quot;Six people since March, you know -- I just got through paying for my husband's expensive funeral&quot; after his death from Alzheimer's disease, Yates's mother, Karin Kennedy, told Cummins.<br>
<br>
Added brother Andrew Kennedy: &quot;The prosecution has unlimited funds. And in a case like this, we're talking about the general expenses of half a million, a million dollars. We don't have that kind of funds.&quot;<br>
<br>
Still, &quot;Today&quot; spokeswoman Allison Gollust insisted yesterday afternoon that the producers were not worried that inclusion of the defense fund address before the murder case is adjudicated might have given viewers the impression that Couric and/or NBC News subscribe to the idea that Yates was indeed suffering from postpartum depression and psychosis when she drowned her five children, one at a time, in a bathtub on June 20.<br>
<br>
Nor are they worried that having Couric tell her 6 million viewers this information might lead them to believe that Couric and/or NBC News believe Yates's actions were defensible if she suffered postpartum depression at the time.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't see how it would suggest that NBC is agreeing or somehow supporting&quot; the defense, Gollust said. &quot;Today&quot; has posted addresses for defense funds before, she said, although when asked if any had been given before a ruling in the case, she said she did not know. Gollust said the show does not have a policy about providing defense fund addresses or 800 phone numbers.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a story that has generated a tremendous amount of interest from our viewers. We thought it was information that might be useful to them,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
But yesterday afternoon, after the &quot;Today&quot; segment had rerun twice on MSNBC, NBC News decided to remove the defense fund information before it ran two additional times. &quot;When we realized it might send the wrong message, we didn't include it in the piece,&quot; Gollust told The TV Column late yesterday.<br>
<br>
The defense fund details also were not included in a cut-down version of Cummins's interview last night on NBC's evening newscast.<br>
<br>
Gollust says that running details of the Andrea Pia Yates Defense Fund was not a condition of getting the interview for &quot;Today,&quot; and the decision to include the information was made by show executive producer Jonathan Wald, who's been in the post for just three months.<br>
<br>
Yates has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to two charges of capital murder in the deaths of three of the children -- the eldest, 7-year-old Noah; John, 5; and the youngest, 6-month-old Mary. She has admitted drowning all five children, also including Paul, 3, and Luke, 2.<br>
<br>
District Judge Belinda Hill had imposed a gag order on lawyers, witnesses and investigators in the case but because she allowed Harris County District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal to announce last Wednesday that he will seek the death penalty, she allowed the defense team to announce it was setting up a defense fund.<br>
<br>
Contacted yesterday by The TV Column for comment on the &quot;Today&quot; show segment, Harris County Prosecutor Joseph Owmby said, &quot;The judge issued the gag order to prevent this type of thing from happening. . . . This has been a most enlightening experience to me in regard to the press -- other than that, I can't comment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saturday afternoon's violent weather can be blamed for plenty of dark TV screens throughout the Washington area, but local Pax affiliate WPXW was hit even earlier last weekend.<br>
<br>
Channel 66 went dark at about 7 a.m. Saturday due to an electrical malfunction in its Fairfax Station office, said WPXW chief engineer Harold Sharland. A Dominion Power electrical feeder leading into the building &quot;burned up,&quot; damaging the transmitter that allows the signal to go out, he told The Post's John Maynard.<br>
<br>
The station remained off the air for the next 30 hours.<br>
<br>
If that wasn't bad enough, WPXW's transmission tower was struck by lightning just before 7 p.m. Saturday. The lightning took out the building's power and phone lines and damaged other internal equipment, said Sharland, who, Maynard reports, sounded like he'd had a really bad weekend.<br>
<br>
The Pax signal was back up on reduced power just after 1 p.m. on Sunday and returned to full power yesterday afternoon. <br>

She can say what she wants.  Work for who she wants.  As long as we remain vigilant and use our judgement on a case by case basis.  It is up to the networks to make a profit.  If Couric does this in this manner. Well, more power to her and the network.  I for one will never take a person's views as my own without first thinking it through.<br>
<br>
ok, enough ranting.  Yeah I think it is outrageous too.<br>
