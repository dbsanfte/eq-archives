<br>
The voices shout from all corners far and wide, &quot;Welcome to West Freeport,&quot; and I was born. I was born, born into the world they call Norrath, the world of which there is no escape or release. Looking in my pocket I found a note, a sword, a few pieces of bread, and a bottle of what seemed to be water. The note read a bunch of things about going to seek my master at the Hall of Truth in North Freeport. North Freeport... what is that, I thought.<br>
 I started asking people around me as to where North Freeport might be located, the first person, Samstone, a nice fellow, brown hair, blue eyes, looked to be somewhat half human and half elf. He showed me where I would go in order to get to the fellow I was looking for. And so I was at the Hall of Truth, there I was given a tunic, and sent out, to destroy all evil. “Death to the Freeport Militia!” is what I heard exiting North Freeport, I didn’t understand, why would Freeport want to kill the Freeport Militia? These questions would soon be answered in my journey out in Norrath. <br>
West Freeport is where I landed next; walking out into the wilderness I saw a many strange creatures, giant rats, large snakes, and fire beetles half the size of me. I didn’t know what to do, Suddenly Attacked! An Orc Pawn charged at me out of nowhere hitting me hard as can be, I didn’t know what to do, I ran around, shouting for help, but no one seemed to want to save me from the evil monster destroying my life. I was relieved see 2 of the guards came running out from their post to save me and destroy the evil Orc. <br>
So I started again, I went out and found a large rat that looked about the same strength as me, and I began swinging, over and over I hit and missed, but eventually it fell to the ground. I cheered, and cheered, going out again, I killed rat after rat, snake after snake. “Ding!” a mystical voice shouted but that seemed as if only I could hear, I had gained a level, a level in experience, in life, in strength and power, this sound was of courage, and great joy, I would learn to love it, and appreciate it more than anything else.<br>
Another Orc Pawn came along, this time I was prepared, being of the same strength as it I fought it with all my might, the fight was close, in the end; I lost, died, returned to the gates of West Freeport. My soloing woes had begun…<br>
<br>
There is more than Freeport?<br>
<br>
My level of power was now at four, killing more rats, beetles, and snakes, I reached a point that West Freeport was no more; I had entered the East Commonlands. Suddenly my ears were spammed with shouts across the zone, people selling this, buying that, it would never end. I made my way along the path till I came across an Inn, with a guard on patrol there, I figured it was a safe point to hunt and further increase my abilities. A bear, snakes, beetles, it would never end, but I killed and killed and killed.<br>
 I was now level seven, and I received a personal message from a man named Gedaraman, asking me if I would like to join with him and a few friends in a hunt to gain more power, weapons, and fame. I agreed without thought, and made my way to the location he gave me. Dodging creatures that I knew would destroy me on sight. I met up with them, fighting at a camp which seemed to contain Orcs; we fought, and as I was promised, gained power and experience, but something more than that occurred at that Orc camp, I made my first friend in the world of Norrath, Gedaraman. With Gedaraman we fought till the death at that Orc camp, day after day. Level eight, I started paying more attention to the auctions across the zone, most people were saying things about being at the tunnel. As I pondered where that was, running around on the sand, I ran into it, a gigantic tunnel, I walked in and saw the most people in one place I have yet to see, some of the same skill as me, while others, all the way up to the level of fifty. <br>
I wondered where the tunnel led, running down it I left East Commonlands, and entered the Northern Desert of Ro. This is wear I met Silvia, a bitch, everything I did wrong she yelled at, she explained to me that she had been through Norrath before and experienced higher levels of the world. She did not tolerate me, and I was pissed, only to learn that she was wiser and experienced than I was, I listened to her tips, to improve myself as a person. <br>
<br>
Guilds<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Level twelve, I met Aammadan, a noble man, with something above his head, it read &lt; Forgotten Legend &gt; I asked him about it, and he put me in touch with a great warrior named Anya. They both sat down with me and talked, I was told how the guild Forgotten Legend was lead by Anya’s husband, Sevenkilts. I had gotten a guild invite, the happiest day of my life yet. A few days later, the guild took me to a place called Upper Guk; this dungeon intrigued me as everything I saw there, past the gate, would kill me easily. The guild had casters cast invisibility on me so I was unable to be seen. Further we went until we got to the room that the holy Ghoulbane was said to be found of a monster that appeared very rare and could kill me with a swipe of the sword. He never did appear that day, but it was fun, and more friends were made. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A lone paladin, not knowing what to do with myself, Anya put me in touch with a man named Brownys. I asked question after question and he was more than willing to help. He led me in the right direction towards being a noble knight. A few weeks past, and my home, Forgotten Legends was disbanded by Sevenkilts. A new guild was formed by Aammadan, called Souls of the Ancient, I decided against joining as it just was not the same.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp More weeks had past and I was now the level fifteen. I met a man named Heihachi, a druid, with the tag Legion of Faith hanging proudly over his head. One thing led to another and I found myself in the guild a few days later. Here, I made friends that would last a long time, Heihachi, Luminox, Talandar, Yokota, Calinot, Calamar, Heke, Tenvardar, Skuma, Denekar, Cardan, Samaddil, Lodar, Kuminns, Geelan, Aticus, Anuvien, Lorrainna, and others. This would be my home and family for a long time…<br>
<br>
HP, HK… Same Difference<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My journey into Highpass Hold was underway. More Orcs, they never seem to get away from you, killing you in all different forms. A group was set up here to hunt, and that is what we did, in a grind for experience I dinged twenty. Happy as could be, I now had a decision to make, I was now a man, a full grown Paladin, what would my surname be. My first choice was taken by Gedaraman that is Divine, Dumdas Divine, would have been nice. I thought about it, and asked the guild for advice, finally ended up with Dumdas Faithbearer. Enough with that, I had to start leveling! I made the short journey to High Keep. There I was pleased to see guards to help me when in trouble. Through this time something very tragic happened. My corpse was all but lost, all of my armor, weapons, was gone. I was wearing mostly plate at the time but still some leather. Skuma volunteered to make me a set of fine plate, his asking charge. FREE! Maybe he thought it was funny, maybe he was bored, but he made the plate red white and blue, I looked as if I was Captain America. I was made fun of day by day, but I didn’t care, I was the all American Pally, and I loved it. <br>
<br>
New Undiscovered Land<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Velious, a new continent was discovered in the world of Norrath, I level 28 was all ready to go out on a new adventure, so I packed my bags and head to Iceclad Ocean. When I got there, cougars swarmed the Island; I quickly found a few parents and killed them one by one. It soon got old though, and one day, I was taken on a trip to the Great Divide, there were large Kodiaks to kill, big wurms, and giants, bigger than I have ever seen. To top it off a new city, filled with dwarfs that walked around real fast.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My next actions I regret, I left my home, my family, recently before I did, many friends also decided to move on in the world, and so did I, I joined a guild named Dragon Society at level 41, mainly because of a friend named Xaviore. Led by Nguyen, Dragon Society showed me new things I would of never gotten to see in Legion of Faith. I just did not feel right there, it was not a family like my guild before. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
A long time later (stuff I don’t feel like writing about)…<br>
<br>
<br>
What is it like to be uber?<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One day things weren’t going so smoothly in the Dragon Society guild chat. Avreen, an officer at the time had left the guild. Fights went on throughout the night and it ended with the guild disbanding. Was a sad day, but I quickly got over it for what was about to happen next. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lodar and Geelan, now Deluan, had joined the guild named Fortitude. After a few talks, and a few weeks for grinding for dings, I found myself in Fortitude. Uber is what I felt, walking around with the title over my head made me feel proud. At level fifty-two I was taken to a place called the Temple of Veeshan. I got my ass kicked by everything that came close, and was a big waste of my cleric’s mana. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Time passed after that, I was level fifty-four, my sixth time going to Temple of Veeshan, remember my old friend Gedaraman, well he made a bard, named Musicles, a few days prior he was invited into Fortitude, he was in my group for this ToV fighting. My resists were high, and I kicked serious butt, I loved every moment of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dumb ass = Dumdas???<br>
<br>
Fortitude had its untimely break up and I was left without a guild. In these next months I had become hated by many and the flame fest would not stop. Fraglak, a group of really nice people, for no reason, I went off on them. Every lamer I could think of in the slightest bit I exaggerated a large amount on our servers message board. I was eventually banned. I could no longer flame to an open crowd, I had realized then, my name truly played its own name, Dumb Ass. <br>
I came back to Norrath after a short break, wanting to make redemption for my mistakes; a new Dragon Society had formed, so I inquired about joining as I was a member of the old. All was working out well until one day in guild chat, I hear a story about a rogue named Smoothh drowning in the pool in Skyshrine, being the Dumb Ass I am, I flamed him, non stop, Iininae, the leader at the time, gave me to boot.<br>
<br>
A New Beginning<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I recently rejoined my family, Legion of Faith, we are working on growing strong doing raids every now than No longer am I focused on uberness, but back to the basics, of family and friends in Norrath.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is my story<br>
