<br>
All members of HECK guilds must abide by the following guidelines for LNS and zone control issues lest they face penalty from their guild’s officers and possible expulsion. These are the rules that we expect our members to abide by and to some extent, the expectation we have of the people we PVP against as well.<br>
<br>
These are matters of honor and while your anger or possibly frustration at the moment may be great, your actions at these times are a reflection on your guild and the alliance in addition to yourself. These situations require the utmost control and maturity must be exercised.<br>
<br>
In “small scale pvp”, if you are killed in by a player, you MUST loot and scoot from the zone for a period of not less than 60 minutes. During this period, you may return to the zone to loot your corpse and then scoot to an adjacent zone that is not the ultimate destination of your killers (no forward LNSing), After looting, casters will have a reasonable time limit of not more than 2-3 minutes after looting their corpse to mem and get the mana for gate or a port. If you are a melee or hybrid, you must make your way to a zone line or secure a TL immediately after retrieving your corpse. During your LNS period, you may not engage in PVP with anyone who was involved with killing you originally, or anyone in their guild/organization regardless of what zone they happen to be in. <br>
<br>
For example, if you are killed in Emerald Jungle on your way to Sebillis by a small group, who is likewise on their way to Sebillis, you may port back, or accept a revive to EJ. You may not engage the group or others in their guild on your return trip. You may not forward LNS to Sebillis as you were defeated on the way to a mutually desired location. You may not head to the Field of Bone and then engage or detain other members of the guild who killed you. You may not heal or buff your allies who may be still engaged with your killers. All you can do, is get your corpse, keep your mouth shut, and leave the zone for 60 minutes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>               If during PVP you are killed by a mob, go LD and are killed, die to falling damage, or GM intervention, you will LNS</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. The caveat to this being, if you have not interacted with another player in PVP for ten or more minutes (say you are hiding somewhere to get mana or regen and a moss snake sneaks up on you and bites you in the ass) and one of these things happen, then we’ll write that off and you don’t have to LNS.<br>
<br>
A related issue, if you put yourself at PVE death risk in the course of PVP, you should not expect your attackers to back off. For example, if as a monk you decide to go and FD behind some mobs (which is ghey btw) or as a caster you decide to invis and run behind some mobs for some perceived safety, you should not be surprised to see your attackers continuing to nuke you from a distance or otherwise following you to finish you off. If you die a PVE death as a result, it was your choice to pursue that route. In that case, you probably should have stayed your ground and fought to the death there.<br>
<br>
If you are killed in small scale pvp, and your groupmates kill all of your opponents in the zone (or if they are forced from the zone or do not engage your group for 15 mins), your onus to LNS is removed.<br>
<br>
Being /AFK is not a repreive from PVP. Do not go /AFK in any zone or any place where you think that a PVP threat might exist. Likewise, if your target has chosen to go /AFK in an unadvisable location, you are free to engage if you so desire.<br>
<br>
In “large scale PVP”, the rules are similar to above with some additional stipulations that mostly involve zone control.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>                   Zone Control</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Zone control may be established in several ways.<br>
<br>
1.        Eliminating all enemies of a given guild who are in the zone or within striking distance of it (not via ports, but via natural zonelines) and holding the zone uncontested for a period of 15 minutes.<br>
2.        Accepting the conceded defeat of a rival organization.<br>
3.        Defacto control – if after 60 minutes of PVP, one side has a better than 2:1 numbers advantage in the theatre of the altercation, and the opponents are not continually engaging, the side with overwhelming forces will presume zone control (possibly in spite of what their opponents may think) and will begin rezzing the dead.<br>
<br>
For example, if you are fighting in Cobalt Scar with an ultimate destination of TOV and the battle rages on as reinforcements come in from the ring and Skyshrine, if you should happen to eliminate ALL enemy players from the zone OR you have overwhelming numbers (at least 2:1) and the smaller number of opponents is hiding out and not engaging for 15 minutes, this will be construed as zone control. <br>
<br>
We will then rez back our dead and continue whatever it was we were doing. If the opponents have not yet conceded and had not engaged in 15 minutes but are still in zone, we will rez back the fallen and proceed to kill those people (who are likely buying time for reinforcements… which 15 minutes should be sufficient time to get them). We will not search for you for hours on end. <br>
<br>
In the face of an “overwhelming numbers” situation, if by chance one of our number gets picked off en route to our destination by a foe who has not yet conceded, we will rez this person back, and he will continue on to his destination with our main forces. On his way, he will not engage anyone from the guild who killed him, respecting a 1hour LNS period.<br>
<br>
Once zone control for a given battle is established (by force or concession) the target destination (in the example above TOV) is to be considered under the control of the organization in question. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>                   If it is a specific mob that is being contested by the battle, the guild with zone control will be entitled to attempt that mob for a period of not less than 3 hours before anyone should have the opportunity to rechallenge.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
As an example, if we defeat (or are defeated) in a battle in CS that is in reality a race for Sontalak, the winning organization should have 3 hours “safe time” to gather additional forces, engage and kill the mob before they have to worry about defeating that same organization again. Obviously, the threat of other guilds not affiliated with the first defeated guild could happen at any time.<br>
<br>
Once zone control is established (as decided by an officer), the rezzing/reviving of our people may commence. Once our revives are complete, revives and translocates for our opponents should always be proffered assuming they are available. The only exception to this would be if there was an expectation of bind rushing, in which case, the offenders can find their own way back.<br>
<br>
Rezzing before an officer has determined that zone control has been established  (battle rezzing) will not happen. Only officers speaking to other guild officers can accept or tender terms of concession. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>                   If you are killed in mass PVP, ideally, you will wait for the battle to conclude at your bind point and await your rez</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. This should be the case 99% of the time. If for some reason you can not wait (for example, you have to log due to RL issues) you may make your way back to the zone with a /afk tag up. You may then loot your corpse and leave the zone immediately. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>                   There will be NO sitting around watching the battles as that gets confusing for both our enemies and allies.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If you were killed and the battle still rages on, you will not engage anyone on the opposing force in ANY zone during the period of LNS regardless of what zones the battle may spill over and travel into. You will LNS for the entire battle (however long it may be) and not just an hour.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>                   Dishonorable Conduct</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Dishonorable conduct will not be tolerated. There is to be no intentional training. Exp deaths are to be avoided wherever possible (though we understand in reality that mobs do sometimes get involved in PVP).  <br>
<br>
There should never be immy healing or mez breaking against purists. Immy situations against 3 and 4 team guilds may arise but the action taken will be at the discretion of the player. No penalties will be levied against those who do heal or buff in these situations <br>
<br>
Using faction to hide behind mobs on an offensive action will be strongly discouraged. For example, one non-KOS monk or mage could disrupt an entire raid in TOV. This is not acceptable behavior for a HECK member.<br>
<br>
The exception to this rule will be when an organization on an opposing faction seeks to overtake a zone where we have already have control. For example, if HECK were in TOV doing HOT, WTOV dragons or NTOV and a giant faction guild zoned in with intent to take the zone from us (an offensive operation), we would not yield the zone to them simply because they are at a faction disadvantage. At the same time, if they were already in TOV before we were, we would not engage given the faction advantage that we have being completely unfair. Where both organizations are largely on the same factions, everything goes.<br>
<br>
There is to be no @#%$ talking to anyone via tells or in public channels. If you can’t congratulate them on a clean kill (or graciously accept praise of the same), please say nothing at all. Failing to curb your mouth may result in you being killed a second time before you retrieve your corpse. Failing to curb your mouth after you kill someone may get you punished by your officers. <br>
<br>
The right to LNS is a privilege granted to honorable guilds and individuals. Those individuals who do not act honorably (@#%$ talking, bind rushing, a history of unprovoked corpse camping, training, etc.) may not be granted an LNS opportunity at our discression.<br>
<br>
The LNS policy is sacrosanct. Any bind rushing or aid given to those still fighting will be severely punished.<br>
