She is at location -1000 -700. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Venenzi Oberzendi' <br>
<br>
Venenzi Oberzendi says 'What is it you want! Can't you see I am gathering reagents for my [master]? If I don't get them for him quickly he might punish me. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Who is your master?' <br>
<br>
Venenzi Oberzendi says 'You do not know of my teacher? The great Kazen Fe'cae! I am one of his illustrious apprentices! If you fancy yourself a necromancer, travel to Lake Rathetear and tell Kazen you wish to study the dark arts. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What reagents' <br>
<br>
Venenzi Oberzendi says 'My master is working on some great project. He's always busy studying an old text he found and murmuring something about following in the footsteps of Miragul.<br>
<br>
Her Master, Kazen Facae, is at location 340 -1600. He will ask you that you bring him Sir Motte's Head. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Kazen Fecae' <br>
<br>
Kazen Fecae 's eyes seem to glow as he turns to you and says, 'Leave me be if you have no reason to be here, mortal!' <br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to study the dark arts'<br>
<br>
Kazen Fecae looks you up and down, his eyes glowing with a soft red light. After a moment he begins to speak though his lips do not move. 'You wish to study under me? Perhaps, if you prove yourself to follow the twisted path. If you prove to be as coldhearted as I then I will let you become my servant.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'how can I prove myself' <br>
<br>
Kazen Fecae says 'The wandering 'knight' Sir Edwin Motte recently slew one of my lesser servants. This foolish knave travels from town to town pretending to be 'good.' Separate his head from his body and return it to me so I may work my magics upon it. This fool will become another plaything for me, even in death. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Symbol of the Apprentice<br>
<br>
Sir Edwin Motte is a level 33 paladin. He is found in 4 places throughout Norrath. The first place is at the Docks in East Freeport. He spawns fairly frequently in the inn. He is easiest to catch here. He is part of a rotation with Tumpy, Groflah, and a barbarian in leather. Just kill these guys if they are there and wait for Edwin to spawn. Once he has spawned, kill him too. He is only level 33 and should be easy to dispose of. <br>
<br>
Bring the head back to Kazen for the Symbol of the Apprentice. <br>
<br>
Kazen Fecae says 'Excellent!' You watch Kazen hold the head by the hair and begin to cast a spell. A flash of darkness centers around the head and the eyes of the dead knight open, a terrible scream emanating from its lips. 'This poor fool here - I think I will keep him in my bag from now on. You have done well, my new apprentice. Take this symbol and know that you can do other tasks to advance within my apprentice ranks.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'How can I advance?' <br>
<br>
Kazen Fecae says 'I share great secrets with my more powerful servants who show me they are willing to serve without question. Tell my servant the name of any symbol he gives you and he will instruct you. If I give you a symbol, speak its name to me so I may instruct you. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What about a symbol of the apprentice?'<br>
<br>
Kazen Fecae says 'You have a long way to go before I teach you the true secrets of life and death. Visit Venenzi Oberendi in the Nektulos forest and show her the symbol. She is collecting reagents for one of my experiments and is taking far too long. I do not wish her dead, yet. I simply need the reagents soon. Retrieve the reagents and give them to my assistant Emkel Kabae. I do not wish to handle them myself. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Task<br>
<br>
Take this symbol to Venenzi and she will give you the Twisted Symbol of the Apprentice. <br>
<br>
Venenzi Oberzendi says 'I see you serve my master as well now. I assume you are here to take the reagents from me which I have gathered for him? I don't know if I like the idea of you gaining the credit for my hard work here. I might consider giving you these reagents, if only you do a small [task] for me.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What task?'<br>
<br>
Venenzi Oberzendi looks down at her robes and back at you. 'There is a certain dark elf magician who has decided to wear the same fashion as I have on several occasions. I do not wish to attend another social gathering in Neriak and look exactly the same as another woman. Slay her and bring me her robe and I will give you my hard earned reagents. <br>
<br>
Now go to the mart on your server which is usually either Greater Faydark or East Commonlands. Buy a Flowing Black Robe for about 200-300 platinum. They are almost always being sold. Take the Flowing Black Robe back to Venenzi for some moss. <br>
<br>
Venenzi Oberzendi says 'Thank you, Seorn . I did not think you would track down Najena and slay her. I think that I am going to return to my old life in Neriak. I am sick of the way Kazen has been treating me. He never seems to teach me anything worthwhile. Don't forget to give his lapdog that symbol with the reagents. I'm sure he will give you a new one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Emkel<br>
<br>
Go back to Lake Rathe and find Emkel, Fazen's Apprentice. He is by the stone skeleton tower. Give him the Twisted Symbol of the Apprentice and the moss for the Symbol of the Serpent. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Emkel Kabae' <br>
<br>
Emkel Kabae says 'I am Emkel Kabae, first apprentice to Kazen. If you have a symbol, tell me its name. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what about the twisted symbol of the apprentice' <br>
<br>
Emkel Kabae says 'Very good, Seorn , you have done as the master asked yet again, take this as a reward.' Emkel reaches into his robes and pulls out a small symbol. He holds it out and the tiny symbol floats to your hand. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is the symbol of the serpent' <br>
<br>
Emkel Kabae says 'There are more reagents to be gathered. The time draws near for our master's ascension. Travel to the lands of Kunark and seek out Ssessthrass. He is a very wise Iksar herbalist helping me in my endeavor to please Master Kazen. Be careful not to insult his speech, or you may end up dead before you serve your purpose to the master. Be sure to show him the symbol as proof or he may consider you dinner.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ssessthrass<br>
<br>
You will need to take this Symbol to Ssessthrass, a named iksar in Swamp of No Hope. He is at location 3800, 1600 which is in a house in the pass to go to Field of Bone. He will give you Scaled Symbol of the Serpent. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Ssessthrass'<br>
<br>
Ssessthrass says 'I do not wisssh to be bothered. <br>
<br>
Give him the Symbol of the Serpent.<br>
<br>
Ssessthrass says 'Sssso, Emkel ssssent you to retrieve the manisi herb? I do not have the herb. The ssssarnak guard the herb. Apparently it is ssssacred to them. Only memberssss of their royal family are allowed to partake of it. They live deep in Chardok. They are hoarding what little of the precious herb there is. If you have an army, perhapssss you can bring me the herb and I can prepare it for Emkel. Bring back this ssssymbol as well. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Manisi Herb<br>
<br>
Next, head to Chardok with 3-4 groups of level 54+. You will need to get to the Overking Area. The herbalist spawns right in front of the secret wall which leads to the Overking Area. He is easier to kill than most other mobs with 18 people. The spawn time is approximately 1 hour and he has a placeholder. He doesn't always drop the Manisi Herb, which is what you need from him so you might have to try this more than once. Return to Ssessthrass and give him the Manisi Herb and the Scaled Symbol of the Serpent for a Refined Manisi Herb. Now go back to Emkel and give him the Refined Manisi Herb. You will get the Symbol of Testing.<br>
<br>
Take the Symbol of Testing and give it to Kazen. Immediately after, three mobs will spawn close by. The last one of them drops the Symbol of Insanity. These monsters are a piece of cake. You can kill them with two groups of 50+. You will need a few good clerics and tanks and they shouldn't cause any trouble. <br>
<br>
Loot the Symbol of Insanity and take it to Drendico Metalbones in Timorous Deep. He is at the docks that take you to the Overthere. If you turn right from the docks and climb onto a stoney hill, you will see this little gnome wandering around 6485, 3829. In return for the Symbol he will give you his journal and asks you to return to him, Eye of Innoruuk, Blood of Cazic-Thule, and Cloak of Spiroc Feathers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Reagents<br>
<br>
To get the Cloak of Spiroc Feathers you will need to speak with Jzil Gsix. You asks for you to bring him a Silver Disc, Spiroc Feathers, and a Black Silk Cape. The Silver Disc is found off of mobs on the second isle. It is most commonly dropped off of Azeracks, level 53 monsters of the second isle. The Spiroc Feathers are dropped from the Watchful Guardian on the 3rd Isle. They are level 53-55. The final item, Black Silk Cape, is dropped by the boss of the fourth island, Keeper of Souls. He is a level 60 mob that death touches every 30 seconds. He can quad hit for 400 which is a real nuisance. Bring along many of your friends to kill him. The cape drops about 1 every 15 times (Drop rate changed as of 5/8. New drop rate needed). Finally, take the three items to Jzil and he will give you the Cloak of Spiroc Feathers.<br>
<br>
The Eye of Innoruuk is no longer dropped from Innoruuk in Plane of Hate since the last Epic Changes patch. Many different mobs were changed and this was one of them. The lesser mobs of this zone drop the Eye of Innoruuk. Some confirmed mobs include Maestro of Rancor and a Ashenbone Drake. Maestro of Rancor is a level 53 Follower of Innoruuk, Maestro of Rancor. He can be found sitting at his piano. Be careful with this guy because he has a 200 hp AOE lifetap spell. If you know of the another mob tell me. Ashenbone Drakes aren't too difficult to kill. They must be meleed to death though because the have very high resistances. The only spell that will affect them are Wizard Lure Spells. They range from level 51 to 53.<br>
<br>
The Blood of Cazic-Thule is dropped off of Terror, one of the iron guardians guarding Cazic's temple in Plane of Fear. He is level 60 and said to be the second hardest creature in Plane of Fear.<br>
<br>
Take all three items plus the journal back to Drendico. He will give you a Prepared Reagents Box.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The End<br>
<br>
Go back to Kazen and give him the Prepared Reagents Box for Tome of Instruction. Next you have to get Gkzzallk to spawn on the Gorgalosk Isle. Do this by giving a Thunder Spirit Princess 3 platinum and then clearing the 3rd island. (More accurate info on this would be appreciated.) Give the Tome of Instruction to Gkzzallk. He will give you Gkzzallk in a Bottle. Take the Bottle back to Kazen. You will finally recieve the Scythe of Shadowed Souls.<br>
