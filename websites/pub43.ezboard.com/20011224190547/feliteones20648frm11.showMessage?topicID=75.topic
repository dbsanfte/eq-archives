The one thing i can say about this zone is that it is tough.  I saw Domination there with 2 groups getting beat up pretty bad and there was quite a few lvl 60's.  The fire giants were conning red to me at 51, so by no stretch of the immagination is this zone too small for us and I believe if you go into it thinking that, then you are not going to have a very pleasant evening.<br>
<br>
It seems to be the toughest old world zone there is.  Very challenging and looks like it would make for one good time.<br>

<br>
common mobs <br>
<br>
Near the zone, in the pool room, and in the noble room is where the Greater Kobolds spawn. Greater kobolds are good experience all the way into the 40's in a group and great solo experience as high as level 46 (when some of them become green). GK's (as they are called by many) can drop up to 5PP worth of coins, Fine Steel (FS) weapons, medium sized Bronze armor, Poison components (which are stackable and sell for about 1PP apiece to vendors), and various research components. <br>
<br>
In the area called the King Room, and as the placeholder for the Kobold Noble, are where the Solusek Kobolds spawn. SK's (another slang term) are very good group experience all the way up to level 50 and great solo experience (if you can pull them.. which is tricky) clear into the low 50's. They drop all the same loot as the GK's but with more frequency. <br>
<br>
Farther down into Sol B, past the kobolds is the area called &quot;Bats and Bugs&quot; because it is populated mostly by Sonic Bats, Lava Beetles, and Lava Duct Crawlers (spiders). This area is exeptional experience, for a group that can handle it, Clear into the low 50's and good solo experience until the mid 50's. The loot isn't as good down here as it is off the kobolds, but they still drop up to 5PP worth of coin and research components. <br>
<br>
Past the Bats and Bugs, there are two ways to go (basically.. there are lots of tunnels but they all lead to one of these two places) The Efreeti, and Nagenfer. <br>
<br>
The route to the Efreeti is populated by Lava Guardians (fire elementals) and Imps. This is Quite possibly the best experience in all of Sol B, and also has really good loot. I would reccomend going with someone who knows the area though, cause it is very dangerous if you are not prepared. The imps and elementals are great experience all the way until the high 50's and I know a few people who have solo killed them (with help.. they are tough) all the way to 60. They drop up to 6PP, FS weapons, and research components also. <br>
<br>
The Last area, the road to Naggy (as he is commonly referred to as) is where the Fire Giants of Sol B live. The fire giants give good experience, but due to thier long spawn times, are not that efficient to hunt for experience. The main reason to hunt the Fire giants is for thier loot. The normal fire giants drop up to 30PP and thier toes (used for magician quest) and research components. <br>
<br>
Named Spawns <br>
<br>
The Noble <br>
Just to the right of the entrance (from Lavastorm) is the spawn known as the Noble room. The noble is a high level enchanter with a pet who sits in this room guarded by numerous GK's. The noble is Tough to fight, mainly because he likes to charm members of your party and send them against you. Give your group a good MR spell and you should have no problem taking him down. He drops the Petrified Erudite Heart Amulet as his rare drop, and the Staff of Writhing as his common. <br>
<br>
The King <br>
Just to the left of the same entrance, and up a big circular stairway, is the lair of the Solusek King. He is a high level Shadow Knight and is a very dangerous adversary. His room is usually camped at the same time as the priest room and the champion room (which are all right next to each other) He hits very hard, has a pet, casts some pretty mean dot's and HT's. His rare drop is the Fleshripper, and his common drop is the Runed Mithril Bracer <br>
<br>
(((((((correction to above post on the king.........Just a minor correction: The way to the king room from lavastorm zone does not go to the right, but to the LEFT. You will pass through a round room with a circular (sp?) ramp going up (hence most often referred to as circle room). Follow the ramp all the way up into another room (which is commonly used as the camping spot for king, champion and priest). To your left you will see 2 hallways. The left one leads into the spawn room of the king and the right leads into the spawn room of the champion. The portion of the wall between the hallways is actually an illusionary one and leads into the spawning room of the priest. <br>
<br>
Important note for the puller: <br>
Allways pull from the right to the left. That means: start with the champ room, take the priest room afterwards and THEN pull the king. Make sure the rooms right of the king are empty ! Otherwise the king and its companions run through the aggro range of the mobs in the other rooms and can lead to a train of more then 10 mobs. That can be rather devasting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Additional info: in the spawning room of the king sometimes a monk (called Targin the Rock) spawns. He hits pretty hard and fast and is VERY resistant to spells. He loots a no-drop book for a monk quest (code of Zan Fi, if i remember right). <br>
<br>
Info for the unwary: <br>
There are 3 spots where rarely a lava duct crawler (short: LDC) spawns. First is directly at the zone entrance from Lavastorm, second is at the pool in the poolroom and third is in the king room area. They can provide some excitement for the unprepared ... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
))))))))<br>
<br>
<br>
The Priest <br>
Next to the king, behind an illusionary wall, is the Priest spawn. The priest is a healer, hits fairly hard, and complete heals himself if given the chance. If you keep him stunned he is an easy kill. His rare drop is the Mithril Breasplate, and his common are the Carnal Pauldrons. <br>
<br>
The Champion <br>
Next to the priest, and viewable from the king's room, is the Solusek Champion. The champion is a high level warrior, and hits about as hard as the king. He is the easiest of the 3 to kill, and has the poorest loot (in my opinion) his rare drop is the Painbringer sword, and his common drop is the Shield of the Slain Unicorn <br>
<br>
The Guano Harvester <br>
Down in the bats and bugs area, sometimes instead of a bat or a bug spawning, a goblin spawns. This is the guano harvester. He has no set spot or time to spawn, so catching him relies purely on luck. Also, as soon as he spawns, he turns himself invisible, so if you are in this area try and keep a see invis on at least one person int he group. He is extremely easy to kill and has some incredible drops. His rare drop is the Cloak of Shadows and his common drop is the soiled bag. <br>
<br>
The Death Beetle <br>
On the way to the efreeti lord, is the death beetle room. The death beetle is a named lava beetle, hits really hard, and has more hitpoints than the normal ones. His common drop is a single use DD item (I can't remember the name at the moment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and his rare are the Black Chitin Leggings. <br>
<br>
Efreeti Lord Djarn <br>
Past all the imp protectors and lava guardians is the spawning place of one of the prizes of Sol B. Efreeti Lord Djarn is a level 50 caster who also hits very hard and has a ton of hps. If you aren't prepared he will whipe the floor with you (although if you made it past the imps and elementals, you can probably handle him) His common drop is Djarn's Amathyst Ring, and his rare are the prized Golden Efreeti Boots <br>
<br>
The Noxious Spider <br>
On the way to Nagenfen is the spider room. In this area the Noxious spider spawns. Nox (his pet name) has a mean poison, hits very hard, and has alot of hitpoints. His Rare drop is the Gold Chitin Bracer, and his common is the Green Silken Drape <br>
<br>
The Stone Spider <br>
In the same area as Nox, spawns the stone spider. The stone spider has a similar abilities to Nox, but can stun as well. He dropps the Brown Chitin Protector. <br>
<br>
Warlord Skarlon <br>
This is one of the first Named Giants you will see when killing off the fire giants. He hits hard, and has a ton of hps. He drops the Razing Sword of Skarlon as his ultra rare drop, the Mithril Arms, and Mithril Legs as his more common drops. <br>
<br>
King Tranix <br>
He is very similar to Warlord Skarlon, he hits hard and has a ton of hps. His rare drop is the Crown of King Tranix and his common is the Polished Mithril Torque <br>
<br>
Magi Rokyl <br>
The toughest of the named giants is as mean as the other two, but also a powerful caster. His rare drop is Rokyl's Channeling Crystal and his common is the Polished Mithril Mask <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fire giants are some of the most challenging monsters for their level range. Immune to magic cast from outside their melee range, giant flagged (meaning they cannot be stunned or mesmerized), with respectable melee damage and health, they can be daunting foes. However, there are additional hazards to fighting them simply given the terrain. A fire giant must never, under any circumstances, be bashed into a wall or allowed to enter lava. <br>
<br>
When a fire giant enters a wall, I have heard that it removes all debuffs upon it and heals fully. While I haven't seen this happen to fire giants, I have seen it with ice giants in permafrost. However, there is an additional hazard here that I was able to experience first hand. Once, a fire giant was knocked into a wall... and it never came back. We waited for it, then all camped out and reentered to eliminate hate. No trace of it. We all thought it must have destroyed itself, and continued as normal. The next pull of fire giants consisted of around 9 fire giants. Every pull thereafter, until the zone was repopped due to a patch, was that way. I believe that the fire giant was possibly stuck under the world, aggro'd during any pull but unmoving, and pulled just about every giant in the vicinity during a pull. In any case, that one little fire giant wiped out at least two subsequent raids after ours. <br>
<br>
Giants can also be knocked into the lava. While I've heard similar things about them healing, I haven't been able to verify this. They can, however, summon people to them while merrily fighting people inside lava. While I suppose a group with heat resistances of 160+ (due to bards or just great equipment) might be able to carry the fight to the giant inside the lava, it generally just means the clerics should camp and hopefully you'll have a necro to retrieve corpses lying at the bottom of a lava pool. <br>
<br>
Further miscellaneous notes on fire giants. The first room has 3 fire giants, one of whom is a roamer. If you float across the lava from near stone spider room, you can come out behind the giants, kill the roamer, then face the remaining two. Feign-pulling makes life much easier. I preferred having two feign pullers to make things go smoother. Enchanters level 49 or higher can charm fire giants with Allure, although the casting time of their charm makes it nearly impossible to charm a fire giant that is beating on them (unless it is slowed) - two enchanters trying to charm a single giant generally will work, as one of them tanks it and the other gets Allure off uninterrupted. Slowing the giant with either their own slow spells or the stronger insects line of shamans will also allow them uninterrupted charms. It's a good idea to have along a shaman regardless, due to the power of their insects line and additional hp buffs on tanks. In a pinch, root-parking giants -can- work. Rooted npcs don't summon, so if you park a fire giant warrior far enough out of melee range, you may be able to keep him out of the fight. Keep in mind that there are fire giant magi, and root parking them isn't nearly as effective. <br>
<br>
It seems like the most troublesome pull is Magi Rokyll and the giants with him should Lord Nagafen be up and about. If Nagafen is dead, this isn't a problem at all. If he's alive and well, the pull of Magi Rokyll can be difficult enough that some groups just stop at Warlord Skarlon and leave.<br>
<br>
Creatures in this dungeon are almost totally immune to fire. The only ones I'm not sure about resisting fire are the Sonic Bats, but using fire based spells on anything else is a waste of time and mana. <br>
<br>
In order or resistances are: <br>
<br>
Greater Kobolds - normalmagic resist <br>
<br>
Solusek Kobolds - normal magic resist for lvl 40 creatures <br>
<br>
Lava Beetles - low magical resistances <br>
<br>
Sonic Bats - no worse than drolvarg sentries <br>
<br>
LDC - Seems like higher resist if you're fighting these at low levels, but normal resistance if you're lvl 45+ <br>
<br>
Lava Guardians - Normal resistances <br>
<br>
Imp Protectors - High Resistance. the only creatures besiides Naggy and the Giants to have it in here. <br>
<br>
<br>
.....if we have enough????<br>
<br>
The efreet spawn is on a 24 minute cycle from death, meaning, that if you kill him or his placeholder at noon, then either the efreet or the PH will spawn approximately 12:24, or 24 minutes after it is killed. <br>
<br>
The common drop is the boots (GEBS) <br>
The rare drop is the ring <br>
<br>
The room spawn will aggro if you pull the PH or the efreet, so clearing the room is important. <br>
<br>
My personal opinion on the GEBS is that they are an awesome set of boots for one reason above all others: They have enough INT to allow me to clear up 2 to 4 slots for mana/resist gear. There really is not a great deal of footwear available to casters considering the huge selections available for some slots, and these are still some of the best in game. (Just my opinion).  <p>Norwolf  -  Ranger on Erollisi Marr, Member of Unbroken Honor

<br>
i've been thinking of planning a FG raid, with the levels we got i'd say we'd need 3 groups to safely do FGs, naggy raids are usually 4-5 groups and they take them out with incredible ease. so we should be ok with 3 for FG's. an FD puller would really come in handy.<br>
<br>
everything else in the zone can be done with 1 group<br>
<br>
if anyone wants to lead a raid i can lend my knowledge of the zone, or i can lead it, it don't matter, let me know when you all are free, i may have a wierd schedule, i'm changing jobs ATM.<br>

If i can remember, i am gonna post this raid on the /gmotd so everyone that doesnt read the board will know and be prepared. Everyone print your maps out that Nor provided and be in LS or at least a druid / wizzy ring early.<br>

<br>
i'm not sure how it will go without a FD puller or an enchanter, but we'll figre that out before we get too far in, the giants will let us know wether they are gonna let us kill them or not.<br>

<br>
But I've done FG raids without an enchanter before, but I think we had like 3 groups down there that night.<br>
<br>
As far as FD pulling,, has Rug said he could or couldn't be there?  Or maybe we can snag up another monk or SK somewhere.<br>
<br>
I've been on a few FG raids and always the hardest part was the initial break...  Always 3 or more giants on first pull and close to a total wipe out, if not complete, every time.   Yeah.. it's great... hehe.. <p><center><table BORDER=5 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 BGCOLOR="#000000" >

<br>
Everyone see that Nagy went down last night:<br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessage?topicID=699.topic">pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfr...=699.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
So there may be some people from that raid still camped there that may be interested in joining us  &gt;&gt;shrug&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
<br>
I was looking at some other things and noted that Forgotten Guard was interested in doing Sol B sometime as well so if the Raid leaders or others want to give Forgotten Guard a post on the Forgotten Guard board or if they know them here is the link:<br>

[note this like shows a few raids they are looking at]<br>
<br>
After reviewing some things:<br>
<br>
If we see and take down a imp protectors that has a No Drop burnt slashes Id like to loot it if possible as its part of a Ranger quest [high level so no huge deal for me currently].<br>
<br>
Do we know if we are entering through LS  or a Sol A entrance?<br>
