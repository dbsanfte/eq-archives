<span class="header"><b>Mission Statement</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">C</span>HP is a family. We strive daily to help our fellow family members whenever we can. CHP will aid our friends in Norrath if we are able. We value honor and loyalty above all. 
CHP is a guild on the Xegony server. <br>Our doors are open to all players no matter character level, race, or class. Membership is decided through a pledging system and is conditional to guild guidelines.</blockquote> 

<span class="header"><b>Guild Structure</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">C</span>HP is governed by Council, the central core of which is the Circle of Four. The tier of Officer is considered an extension of Council, and Officers also have website updating abilities.<br>Decisions are attained by consensus and vote.<br>The guild treasury is the CHP Guild Library, which is a repository where all members of CHP can donate and borrow items, and which is run by the Guild Librarians. The Head Librarians are able to update the website to reflect the ingame status of the Guild Library.<p>
The current CHP Council, Officers, and Librarians are:<ul>
<li>Atanev-Council Member/Officer
<li>Mileron-Council Member/Officer
<li>Samnie-Council Member/Officer
<li>Zarger-Council Member/Officer
<li>Marynah-Officer/Events Co-ordinator
<li>Kennet-Officer/Head Librarian
<li>Aalya-Officer/Librarian
<li>Dreddnought-Officer
<li>Lectum-Officer
<li>Riehnholt-Officer
<li>Dimandra-Officer
<li>Aerlyn-Librarian 
</ul></blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Guild Dues</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">T</span>here are no Guild Dues imposed on any members of CHP. We feel that if and when there are ever monetary needs - then CHP members are usually more then happy to pitch in what they can, when they can.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Guild Library</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">W</span>e have a Guild Library, in which there are a great many items that are donated by members of the Guild for other members to be able to borrow for their own characters. <p>It is open to all members after thirty (30) days of membership. A member may begin donating from the day of membership, but the probationary period must be met before withdrawals can be made. For item availability and withdrawal information please visit the Guild Library Link, and see the hours of availability usually posted on the CHP Calendar.<p>
The Guild Library is overseen by Lile and Kennet - who are the Head Librarians, and several dedicated members of the Guild who serve as the Guild Librarians of CHP. Together, they all run the Guild Library to accept items from members, handle withdrawals, and update the web site to maintain an accurate reflection of the ingame items available to the members of CHP.<p>We ask only that items such as Gear and Weapons that are borrowed be returned when a character is done with them, so as another member of CHP may make use of them. All GL items are donated by the generosity of our members, so it's our aim to keep the GL items in the family.  <p>Donation to the Guild Library is not a requirement - it is a purely voluntary aspect of guild life here in CHP.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Multiple Accounts</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">V</span>erant Interactive explicitly states they do not support account transfers between players. As such, CHP does not support or condone such transfers. If one does take place, the CHP Council and Officers will not assist or mediate any disputes that may arise due to complications or changes of heart.<p>
CHP guilds people not toons. We assume you are playing your toon at all times. We recommend not sharing accounts per VI policy. Should you chose to do so please remember you will be held accountable at all times for all actions of your toon.<p>

CHP does not frown upon a single CHP member owning multiple different accounts, as long as that member is the sole owner of each account. <p>

Account sharing is also not supported by Verant Interactive and any complications arising from account sharing, also will not be assisted or moderated by CHP Councilors or Officers. <p>

If your account is hacked, please let a Councilor or Officer know so that we will be aware of any unusual behavior of your characters and can try to help catch the culprit.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Sexual Harrassment</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">E</span>verquest is a game. A game that people from all across the world, from all walks of life 'log in' and play. Male, female, young, old, there's a real person behind every name in blue, dark red, or purple. <p>

There's no rules that say whether or not a person needs to play a male or female character based upon their real world gender. So that female wood elf druid you just hit on could be a big burly teamster, sitting behind the keyboard. <p>

Off color (ok, sexual) jokes will be said in group- or guildsay. Folks who are more predisposed to saying terms of endearment (mothers, affectionate people) such as 'hon', 'dear', etc, will say it, emote it, whatever. <p>

Flirting happens. <p>

However, a line will be drawn by each individual person. If you're in a group, and someone asks you to knock it off with the body parts jokes, sexual comments, innuendo, flirting, please stop. <p>

Sending tells to a person that are over the line, like 'Xplayer tells you, 'I wanna freak you up and down' can not only get you /petitioned and /reported, but banned as well. <p>

Each person has a right to play this game with out having to worry about getting harrassed when Xplayer logs in. Because of that our policy is that the first time you are reported for sexual harrassment, of any form,the incident will be investigated, a screen shot from the person being harrased would be helpful during the investigation. If it did occur, you will go on probation. Any further offenses that are reported against you, you will be banned from CHP. This includes the guild and the forums, and just be glad we didn't /petition you with Verant. <p>

To report sexual harrassment, either contact a council member or officer in game or through a private message (PM). We will see the matter taken care of quickly and discreetly. Please remember that a screenshot of what was said will help speed things along. </p>

<span class="header"><b>Pledging</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">I</span>f a person wishes to join our ranks they must pledge. To do so they must register to our message boards and state their intent in the Call Hall. The person must then have two sponsors vouch for their character and playing ability. Seventy-two (72) hours after the second sponsor has spoken for the pledge, the person may be guilded</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Sponsorship</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">A</span> sponsor is responsible for the pledge. If a person sponsors someone then they are to make sure that the pledge is guilded and made to feel welcome. They are to make certain the pledge knows of events and attends as many as possible. If a pledge or new member is in need of assistance, including Teleportation or Resurrection, the sponsors are responsible for procuring the assistance.  <br>CHP encourages the sponsor/new member relationship to last sixty (60) days.</blockquote> 
<span class="header"><b>Guilding Spouses</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">I</span>t is the policy to guild the spouse of a CHP member as soon as the spouse has pledged. The seventy-two (72) hour wait time is waived and the pledge may be guilded as soon as an officer is contacted and gets with the pledge for guilding.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Helping fellow members</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">W</span>hen a member asks for help it falls first to the other members to help each other. However, we are not at each other&#8217;s beck and call and there may be times when help is unavailable. </blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>When asking for help</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">P</span>lease remember that each of us play this game on our own free time, for enjoyment. Ask for help from fellow members with in reason and know that help may not always be available.  When requesting help for a quest or experience please use the events forum, so that all members will be aware of your request and will be able to help you, if they can.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Conduct towards other members</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">P</span>lease remember that all members are in your family. Treat them with respect. Like all families arguments will arise. Keep them out of guild chat and off the forums. If you need the intervention of an officer or council member please request it in /tell. </blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Conduct towards other players</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">R</span>emember that everything you do reflects on CHP.  CHP does not tolerate rude or offensive comments in any chat channel, including /ooc or /shout.  If you find yourself in a negative situation with another player and cannot control your temper ask a council member or officer for help</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Complaints/Reports of unacceptable conduct</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">K</span>eep it out of guild chat and off the forums, plain and simple. If you need to make a complaint or report do so in /tell or via a private message on the boards. Do not discuss it with fellow guild mates. If the council and officers decide that the general membership needs to be apprised they will do so in the private forums.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>When a complaint is made</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">T</span>he council and/or officers will investigate the complaint and question all those involved. If after the investigation, the accused is found guilty they will receive a warning, If the accused has a second complaint made they will receive probation, length to be determined at that time. If a third offense is investigated and proven the accused will be removed from the guild and access to the forums will be removed. CHP does not tolerate fraud. Fraud of any kind is grounds for immediate de-guilding. Fraud includes, but is not limited to, your character being played by someone other than you, scamming, and hacking.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Recruitment</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">W</span>e do not actively or openly recruit. Our membership will direct any person wishing to join to our web site and advise them of the pledging requirements. 
CHP believes in guilding the real life player, not the in-game character.  Upon request, any alternate characters played by a CHP member can be guilded.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Deguilding Policies</b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">I</span>n the event you feel you're no longer part of the CHP family, we ask that you contact an officer or council member via PM or /tell ingame to announce your intention to /guildremove.<p>

You are not required to post a goodbye message on the forums.<p>

Deguilding in anger (spontaneously deguilding because you feel slighted or wronged) is unacceptable. If you feel close to this action, please contact an officer/council to resolve the situation.<p>

If you wish to pledge another guild, we ask that you deguild prior to posting your pledge. We also ask that you speak to a council member prior to this action.<p>

Upon deguilding from CHP, your access to the Private Forums will be removed. <p>

If you join another guild, forum access will be determined on a case-by-case basis. You will also be given a title denoting your new guild or, if you chose, explorer/ally forum access based upon Council's determination.</blockquote>

<span class="header"><b>Samnie - </b></span><blockquote>
<span class="dropcap">W</span>e have a saying in CHP: &#8220;We guild people, not toons.&#8221; If we were interested in how uber your toon is we would be a raiding guild like Machin Shin. I for one am glad we are not. In CHP everything we do is voluntary you are not required to attend a certain number of events to stay guilded, nor do you have to attend any. If you need help someone is bound to be there for you. It may not be right away, but help will come. If you need a shoulder to cry on, my pixels are always there. I know that is true for most others in the guild too.<p> 
I want from CHP exactly what I put into it. I don&#8217;t expect everyone to drop everything to come help me if I&#8217;m in trouble, though most of you would if it were possible at the time. I do expect respect for me, my fellow guild mates and the name we have built for ourselves in Norrath. I will give that same respect and be there for my guild mates whenever I can.  I am proud to call myself a CHiPer and will always be glad I had this experience in my life.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Zarger - </b></span><blockquote><span class="dropcap">C</span>rusaders is family.  I have enjoyed my time and friendships developed here.  Many of my RL friends also play and that adds to the enjoyment.  CHP is a place to hang out with friends, have funny stories to tell, adventure together, help each other.  It is a fine group of people I associate with and would not choose otherwise. </blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Delgin - </b></span><blockquote><span class="dropcap">C</span>rusaders is like family. It is also a great learning exp. I have learned a ton of tactics and tips for playing from CHPers. CHP is a chance to see parts of the world you may never get a chance to otherwise. CHP is a group that is definitely together for everyone's mutual benefit. Someone is always there, with a hand, an encouraging word, an item you could really use, a helpful tip, a buff, even a good joke. I have seen sacrifice, service, compromise and patience in CHPers since day one. Which is why I remain Delgin Lonewolfe, at your service.

Unlike the eye witnessing of a player being degraded in say last night in Thurg by a guild mate because he missed a raid where he could have gotten better armor.  So sad.<p>

Then i started to realize that a guild doesn't mean anything if the people aren't friendly. And CHP has those kind of people because when i needed somthing they did what they could to give it to me.this is the reason i am with and will prolly be with till the end of my days.</blockquote>
<span class="header"><b>Dreddnought - </b></span><blockquote><span class="dropcap">I</span> started EQ because a large part of our RL gaming group moved away, &quot;grew up&quot; and lost their free time, or just plain lost interest in gaming. There are still a couple core groups left, but we don't play as often. EQ kinda filled the void.<br>
   CHP provides the best of EQ for me. People in game I can count on when the pick-up groups get weird, yet l can solo if I'm not feeling social without getting anyone upset. Conversation (even if I just listen in on it) that's fun and and positive and even informative sometimes. People who don't get all upset when things go wrong. The GL ... especially the spells, got so tired of researching with Chaucer, don't know why I started 2 more int casters lol. And a forum that's both great looking and easy to use.

After my house caught on fire I only bothered to salvage one item out of the rubble a Small Burnt Plaque. <p>

Imposed in silver on the top is my Family name 'Lipchitz' and a poem, which reads<p>


<i>'You got this from your father it was all he had to give, so it&#8217;s yours to use and cherish for as long as you may live. If you loose the watch he gave you it can always be replaced, but a black mark on your name son can never be erased. It was clean the day you took it and a worthily name to bear when you got this from your father there was no dishonor there. So be sure you guard it wisely after all is said and done you'll be glad your name is spotless when you give it to your son'</i><p>

This is how I feel about CHP
