My weapons are songblade, EoE, quarm hammer and Despair.  I have most of my songs.  Just to give you an idea of my gear as a basline when I'm describing how easy or difficult something is.<br>
<br>
Destruction:<br>
Very easy trial.  Bring at least 3 classes that can tank.  (time geared necroes offtank very well here BTW)  Bard sings ae slow along with normal songs.  Getting things slowed is less important than getting them debuffed so your casters can do DPS.  Mob DPS is so weak that as long as healers arent getting interrupted or you have horribly undergeared people you will be fine. Just kill 20 things under the time limit, then the FULLY slowable boss.  (my group has easily broken 30 things dead)<br>
<br>
Efficiency:  AKA the caster belt trial.  (MMM clickie belt drops here)  Each wave spawns 3-4 mobs, Elites and commanders are slightly harder than the soldiers.  The soldiers hit amazingly weak.  Think PoV mob DPS.  Stuff is mezzable here. but has insanely high MR.  it's better to pump DS and just tank everything.  There is an AE that reduces your HP and mana pool, play group DA song before you say &quot;begin&quot; and you avoid the first AE.  After that have all radiant cure classes cast it immeadiatly after the AE.  (Having warrior click epic about 10 seconds into wave 2 can be nice because some people will bounce the second AE.  You cannot DA through the 2nd-4th Aes because they come mid-wave.)  The boss is total chump.<br>
<br>
Ingenuity-  All this trial takes is a bard and a pet class.  Group sets up on on of the platforms with a dragorn weilding 2 visible weapons. Bard Spawns the boss and FM until you lose aggro.  group farms 2 bane weapons for the pet, and waits for repop (5 second repop) and farms a weapon for the tank.  Tank engages boss with 200+ damage sheild.  DS+ pet dmg = dead boss in a few minutes.  Only unresistables like harmtouch, mana/lifeburn can dmg boss.  By far the easiest trial with bard+mage.  For a real challenge try to beat it with more than 10 minutes remaining on the timer (you'll want 2 mages)<br>
<br>
Subversion (chests/lull trial)  Group parks on back wall except for chest disarmers.  you need 1 luller (bard best but clr/enc works) 1 bard/rog disarmer, 1 int caster, and 1 priest (or necro can disarm priest traps for some odd reason).  start trial and 6 chests pop of random type.  1 minute later roamers come from the zone-in.  2 up maximum at once.  Use PoP lull!! (SSoQ)  OOw lull does not work.  I've never had a lull resist, cirtical or non aggro. make sure chanters and clerics know this too.  Loot 300 points and roamers despawn, boss and 2 guards become targetable.  Lull the 2 guards and pull boss.  This boss is by far the most badass.  I have had a 14k hp well sheilded/AAd warrior die here more than once with a GoD geared 800+ AA'd cleric healing.  (only ghetto bard slow however).  I might add: subversion is the closest trial to zone, pretty quick to get to.<br>
<br>
Weaponry:  This trial is retarded.  all that truly matters is your weapon selection.  There should be an NPC outside that hands out loot when you hand him a blunt/slash and piercing weapon with a good ratio.  It's kinda dumb, but unless you have 2 rangers with full complements of Qvic + weapons you are going to fail this trial without a primo group.  A guildmate lead of group of (all time/&lt;Qvic geared) ranger, cleric, paladin, necro, enchanter, rogue, and didnt even make it past the second mob (of 4) before they timed out.  My regular group, however, has a 100% sucessrate. (very similair AA level, not positive on their weapon arsenals) We go in with rogue (all mobs take full dmg from backstabs, rogues MUST swap in piercers) ranger (uber slashing weapons, kinda gimpy piercing and blunt) warrior (uses that VDD clone from efficiency + riposte disc vs the blunt guy to do 10-15% damage in 12 seconds) bard (me using Q hammer/despair, songblade/EoE, and 2 velium gemmed pokers) necro (parses 750+ DPS versus Steelshock the low HP mob that only spells can hurt), and a cleric for heals, and pet/reverse DS/nukes on steelshock.  As a bard you swap weapons as required, keep haste/atk up at all times and don't slow in order to maximize dmg taken from DS.  There is no boss here.  But there is a quad-hitting 2300 named for war epic 2.0 enroute to weaponry trial. (Possesed Brute)<br>
<br>
Fear - By far the best trial.  Requires group make-up, gear, AAs, skill, and adaptation.  You must kill a certain number of things before time expires, and you must survive.  I've never not killed enough.  If you fail here it will be because you wiped.  There are 4 things around the outside (undead, dragorn, elemental, and wolf)  They summon a minion every few minutes (it's on a timer from when the last minion of that type died.)  If it's a light blue con minion it is fearable, but quads for 1300 with very high atk.  They also have very high magic resist, and must be malo'd or tashed for fear to be reliable.  These light blue cons have many hps (100K plus I think).  However Every tick they are feared a massive dot afflicts them draining about 15% of their health.  Fear is the only way to kill them.  Bard AE fear works well for keeping the 1300 hitters off your cleric or necro/chanter who is fearing.  However, bard fear may overwrite fear from others, I'm not sure, be carefull.  The minions also can summon dark blue mobs (it seems to be about 50/50, I've seen 4 drk blue at once and 4 light blue.  I've seen the first 6-8 all unfearable, that sucked.)  The dark blues hit 850ish and must be tanked/DPSd.  For this trial you absolutely need a debuffer and a dedicated fearer.  chanter, necro and cleric are best at fearing, however most clerics I know have never used fear or done any type of CC and make poor choices as primary fear class.  Necroes tend to have extended affliction items which make their fears last longer.  Bards are not as usefull here as in the other trials.  There is no boss.  Just kill stuff and survive. <p>-steps 70 bard of karana</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mearisthecowslayer>Mearis The Cowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#330000>(12/10/04 6:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19978.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: MPG group trials from bard perspective</span><hr size=1> Great post, a few things:<br>
<br>
Destruction:<br>
All covered, but 3 tanks are not needed, since the mobs hit so weak.  The most mobs I have ever killed is 24, and we were waiting on spawns the entire time - 30 seems impossible just because of the rate at which stuff despawns.<br>
<br>
Efficiency:<br>
Great write up, however, you can easily block the AE every wave.  AE is exactly recast every 5 minutes, use a stopwatch and time DA, this trial is very easy, however mobs have insanely high MR and the mana drain AE makes caster DPS really suck.<br>
<br>
Ingenuity:<br>
Great right up, again, boss hits quite hard unless the warrior is very well geared.  Chain CH's on a 10500 HP/2200 AC tank unbuffed does not always cut it, a cleric + a spam healer is a must.<br>
<br>
Subversion:<br>
Again, nothing to add.<br>
<br>
Weaponry:<br>
This trial sucks, takes a very stacked group for it, easy but the group make up for this one makes it suck.<br>
<br>
Fear:<br>
Agree, this is by far my favorite trial, this trial is all about player skill.  Wanted to add that a lot of classes can do all sorts of ghetto tricks, for example banishment works fine on the fearablle mobs for druids/mages/clerics, and paladins can fear the undead mobs, and drui/rng can fear animals.  Very very fun trial. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyepez>kyepez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#330000>(12/11/04 8:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19978.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: MPG group trials from bard perspective</span><hr size=1> a great write up!<br>
<br>
Fear:<br>
<br>
Group Make up:  SK, Pally,  Bard, Ench, Cleric, Magician<br>
<br>
Split your group into two &quot;teams&quot;  SK and Bard on the Dragorn + Wolf side and Pally + enchanter on the Skelly + Elemental side.  Have the magician and the cleric on the back wall.<br>
<br>
The break is the hardest part and having 2 pc's that can fear and take a bit of a beating only have to fight 2 mobs is good.<br>
<br>
The &quot;a Fearless Dragorn, etc&quot;  are mezzable.  Makes em trivial.  The fearable ones need to be malos'd (wake up AFK mage!).  Have the Cleric DI himself before the fight and use low aggro HoT's or CH's (once broken).  The only spam high aggro heal he should need is on the break if the chanter gets a mez resist or tash aggro.  (a pally's healing power for back up is nice, as well as the little ghetto group heal that the SK brings).<br>
<br>
Have the mage assist the SK/Paladin on the mezzable ones and burn them down (cleric + enchanter nuking and bard meleeing where possible.  SK, Pally, Ench and Bard Fear a mob when necessary (have the member call out when going into chain fear mode (best to have your bard/cle/chanter focus on this b/c their DPS sux.  And basically just light the trial up w. DPS on the mezzable ones and keep fear on the light blue cons.<br>
<br>
Once you make the break, it's all about communicating w. your group what each is doing so mezzes/fear's aren't over lapping and group members can assist the correct person to burn down the mezzables. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=99187">In the juvescence of the year, came Kyepez the Tiger...</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

you can do this trial with almost any group setup with a bard and a debuffer, and anyone who can taunt in it, or even w/o debuffers but need more healers. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-family:Times;font-size:medium;">Impresario</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Times;font-size:medium;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120074" target="top">Cerezo EdgeWalker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Strats like:<br>
<br>
Make mob die, keep ur hp &gt; 0.  While helpful, tend to bring little substance to the discussion.  Are there alternate ways to beat the trial?  I'm totally sure of it. <br>
<br>
But for folks who have run the trial a few times and failed and are missing that 'link' to go from CR to Win; detailed posts might be helpful to see how their group can fine tune the strat.<br>

I created a silent MP3 that gives warning beeps at 4:30 and 4:45.  It provides an excellent in-game, on screen timer and it autorepeats, so after you press play when the first one goes off there's nothing else to press.  I usually hit DA at about 4:52 on the MP3 player.<br>
<br>
The MP3 can be downloaded here: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.twistoffate.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=74">www.twistoffate.org/forum...c.php?t=74</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

Type /mp3 to bring up the player in game, load the downloaded song and it will always come up as your default song unless you actually use that crappy player for music.<br>

Once we had a necro as the only survivor on subversion.  I was second to last, fired off deftdance while he popped wake the army on our 4 dead groupmates.  I guess 2 of them enraged for 24 extra seconds of tankage and the necro clicked manarobe and got enough mana to finish the boss off.  After rezzing, the rest of the group got their flags for beating the event.<br>
<br>
My other best story was on Fear.  Our shaman was a first timer and ran far out for some reason, ignored the emotes and got deathtouched.  we dragged back and the cleric rezzed.  Then the cleric fired a big heal on the tank with 3 fearables inc.  Dead cleric.  Shaman zones in and shammy rezzes cleric. and starts eating himself.  Cleric zones in just long enough to get pasted a second time while looting.  Necro rezzes cleric.  (at this point the shaman is chain cannabalizing and barely getting off trushar's between malos, necro and I running around like maniacs fearing things, and the warrior is defensive tanking 2 unfearable.  Somehow we scrape together enough mana/kills to win. <p>-steps 70 bard of karana</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dsavereide>dsavereide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#330000>(12/14/04 4:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19978.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> MPG group trials from bard perspective</span><hr size=1> Slightly different perspective. My guild farms Fire. Fenin is the only elemental god we've killed.<br>
<br>
Destruction: never beaten it. Got to 19 mobs a couple of times. The first time with two minutes remaining there were no mobs. We didn't know how it worked or how many we had to kill and we thought we had won. Then just after the final minute mark, two mobs spawned catching us off guard. Didn't get them dead and we lost. Since then it worked normally until last night. We started, one mob. Killed it, no mobs. One minute timer goes off, then a second mob came. Killed it, no mobs. After the second minute timer a few came and it was more normal with continuous mobs. Since we were in AE mode, one mob wasn't very efficient and the dead time cost us. Have you all had this kind of irregularity?<br>
<br>
As for difficulty, any elemental melee can off tank with Bard AE slow as the only slow. Yeah, even bards. Shaman epic and group heal HoT are a big help to the cleric. It's just getting enough DPS for us. Keeping the mobs in AE range and casters controlling aggro.<br>
<br>
Ingenuity: for elemental groups, get two pet classes. Beast and mage work well. Farm the bane weapons before engaging the boss because it reduces the amount of time you have to keep your tank standing. You can avoid instant aggro by saying begin out of direct los (ie. don't stand on the ramp, stand completely off the platform and keep hailing till you find a spot where he responds). Boss aggro range is huge, so keep your group tight to the wall while you farm. Position the group between two mini-platforms and one will always have a mob waiting for you.  Arm the pets first. Tank can loot his right before pulling. Alternating cleric chain casting CH and shaman or druid splash healing in between will keep a 12k tank up. IMO, the easiest trial. <br>
<br>
Fear: Lots of fun, and yes you can lose without wiping. Just don't kill enough and they go poof. I've been the dedicated fearer several times and this has never been a problem. Just make sure you are using screech and not song of midnight. And keep in mind the small range. Get in their face. I think we make better fearers then chanters because we can take a few hits while trying to get it to stick.<br>
<br>
This requires a group that can pay attention and can react quickly. Sometimes feared mobs get stuck in the corners. Make sure your casters know not to stand next to them. Or fear breaks and they get whacked. These guys hit harder than the unfearables (they have a proc of some kind). <br>
<br>
Comment on the original post, bard fear does not overwrite others. When back when, I used to fear kite with my brother's ranger. He used panic animal, I used screech. They stack, in the sense that when one of us got the worn off message the animal was still feared by the other. This worked great because as we refreshed our respective fears it was still fleeing. I think it works like our slows plus caster slow. The mob has both slows on him, but only one is active. One wears off the other is still there.<br>
<br>
Efficiency: Mezzing is a waste of time, even more so for elemental groups who don't have the DPS to spare. As long as you have a tank on the commander and off tank on the elite, any melee can take hits from the soldiers. I just play AE slow and AE MR debuff. The main difficulties we've had is casters avoiding aggro.  I've never been able to time the subsequent AEs, but I'm going to try out the mp3 timer. Thanks for posting it. For the most part though, casters seem able to manage the mana drain. Except for wizards. They just hurt. Even a 6.5k mana cleric can cope, so don't let it psych you out. An epic'd shaman with the group HoT AA can take a lot of pressure off.<br>
<br>
Question, if the warrior epic can bounce the AE, you think Dark Echo or chanter bounce buff would work?<br>
