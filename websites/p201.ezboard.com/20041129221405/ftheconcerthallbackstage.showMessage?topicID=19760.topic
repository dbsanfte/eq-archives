Far as I can tell the AA are on the Test server based on the original poster's comments. Test server isn't covered under the NDA. This is the second time they have been posted up here anyways, not really any new information here aside from reinforcement that the current AA suck ass.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jimmayjam>Jimmay Jam</A> at: 9/8/04 10:21 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kulamiena>Kulamiena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#330000>(9/8/04 10:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19760.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OoW AA Costs...</span><hr size=1> I thought Dance of the Blades was changed as per <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=bardbalance&amp;message.id=1758" target="top">this</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> thread? blech! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kulamiena>Kulamiena</A> at: 9/8/04 10:30 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kelrazbladesinger>Kelraz Bladesinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#330000>(9/8/04 10:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19760.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eagle2.american.edu/~ch4890a/icon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OoW AA Costs...</span><hr size=1> Honestly, even if the NDA was broken ... who cares?

Exactly. An AA is the exact same exp as it takes to hit level 51 from 50 I believe. In Luclin AAs took a few hours a pop, in PoP you got that number down to an hour a pop. GoD introduced AAs in 25 minutes a pop. OoW will probably have AAs every 20 minutes or so. <p><embed src="http://www.angelaee.com/kelraz.swf" width="400" height="150" loop="false" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">

That would mean more AA points to max bellow than just about anything else we do. Does that mean my class defing ability is bellow? To be a good healer you need lots of AA in those hat affect healing, nukers in those that affect nuking, tanks in Hp and defensive skills and so on for other classes. We get bellow? In my more paranoid moments when really sleep deprived I think they are just trying to get bards out of the game.<br>

2handers take much less damage from ripostes and damage sheilds, these new AAs start to even that out.  (however a 40 delay 2 hander takes a TON less damage than a 20 delay duelwield calss who spends all these AAs, it doesnt seem quite fair)<br>

This is fucked up , the Equivalent Chanter AA ability (permanent illusion) costs 3 AA  but ours cost 7 ???  This AA is just a fun thing , it doesnt give super power or make your character stronger..<br>
