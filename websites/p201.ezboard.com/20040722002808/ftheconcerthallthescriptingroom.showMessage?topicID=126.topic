He reaces up and takes down the sowrd that is hanging above it.  As he walks to the table to polish the sword he takes a few practice swings into the air.  You can tell by how he moves and holds the sword that he was once a master swordsman.<br>
<br>
He reaches the table and sits down looking at the sword he is holding in his hands and starts thinking back to his younger days.  Just then there is a knock on his door bringing him back to the now.  The old man lets out a sigh as he walks to the door.  He remembers back to when his bones didn't ache so much.  Some tell him its from wearing that heavy plate armor he had all the time.  Some tell him its from all the hours spent doing silly adventures trying to kill himself.  They are probably both right he thinks.<br>
<br>
As he opens the door he gets mugged.  He looks down and pats his grandson on the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;hehe welcome my boy how have you been?&quot;<br>
&quot;I've been great grandpa.  Daddy told me to come over and have you tell me a story.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well I think I can do that for you my boy why dont you run over to the table and I'll be right there.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young boy quickly does as his grandpa told him to while the old man shut the door and made his way there himself.  As he gets to the table he notices the young boy can't stop looking at the sword.  It was a very beautiful sword.  with a long thin blade and a hilt that almost looked like feathers and a red gem in the middle of it.  It was a very magical sword that still had some magic left in it.<br>
<br>
The young boy looks up at his grand pa with big bright eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grandpa what did you do with this sword?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well my boy I think a better question would be what didn't I do.  But let me tell you one of the stories.  I remember the day I got that sword here my boy.  There was a man that wanted me to find a couple pages of his music and to help him get a special lute.  <br>
<br>
&quot;well a gnome told me that I needed to get a dragons gut for the stings of this magical lute.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;EWWWWW! dragons guts?  thats gross grandpa.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;hehe well my boy I wasn't making the lute i just needed to get the pieces.  Anyways the dragon I needed to kill was named Trakanon.  He was an evil dragon in the deep part of the ruins of sebilas.  I knew I would need help to kill him so I got with a lot of my friends.  We went down there and fought the most intence battle I have ever fought.  We almost didn't make it but in the end the dragon had died to our forces.  I took out my dagger and opened up the dragons belly and took his gut.<br>
<br>
&quot;I went back to the gnome and he made me the most beautiful lute I had ever seen.  Then i went back to the person who was looking for this lute and his music and I gave it all to him.  In return he handed me this sword.  In all my years it has never lost its edge but its magic doesn't seem to be there as much as before.<br>
<br>
&quot;Magic?  what magic grandpa?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;let me show you my boy&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man picks up the sword off the table and concentrates.  Soon the sword has blue music notes floating off of it.  The young boy gasp in astonishment and looks at his grandpa<br>
<br>
&quot;It used to do that a lot grandpa?&quot;<br>
&quot;it used to do that whenever I held is my boy.  With out me concentrating on it&quot;<br>
&quot;Well grandpa I should be going it is getting late thank you for telling me the story&quot;<br>
&quot;no problem my boy i appreciate the company&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man walks to the boy and lets him out.  As he watches his grandson run off into the distance he thinks back on all the adventures and danger that he was in.  He thinks about all of the friends he had made back in those days and wonders what they are doing now.  He turns around and closes the door.  He walks in and picks up the sword and replaces it over the fireplace.  <br>
<br>
The old man chuckles to himself for a bit and says to himself &quot;Lanaliel I wouldn't give this up for one more adventure&quot; He goes into his living room and sits down in his rocking chair.  The same one he's been sitting in since the day he retired. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=269394">Lanaliel </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
