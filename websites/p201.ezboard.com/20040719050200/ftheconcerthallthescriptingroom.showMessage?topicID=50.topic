<br>
 <br>
<br>
The traveller comes upon the tavern in the waning hours of daylight and raucious laughter can be heard coming from within. After studing the establishment for a few moments the traveller walks up to the door and pushes it open and enters. As the travellers eyes adjust to the brightly light interior the traveller sees that it is a bustling place many tables are scattered throughout many are occupied at the back is a low area with a fire place with a small fire going in it with a heavy soot blackened kettle over it. Several patrons were sitting around the fire laughing boistously. Along the length of the right wall ran a long bar with an opening at either end and behind the bar were 3 bar minders busily serving up whatever was shouted at them by the customers and bar maids. Behind the bar minders was a door way with which the aroma of spices and the smell of cooking meat wafted through.<br>
<br>
The traveller flings back the hood of the cape to reveal a half elven woman with soft features but the cape hides the rest of her. As she walks to the fire pit several men turn to stare at her and several have a look that can only be described as drunken lust but one look from her changes many of the mens minds and they go back to swilling whatever is in their mugs and laughing at their mates.<br>
<br>
The half elf wends her way to the fire place and the warmth it offers and finds an empty chair near the fire and sits in it: a bar maid wanders past and she singals that she wants ale. She sits there and soaks in the surrounding noise and smiles at the sounds she hears. The bar maid returns and the traveller opens her cloak to reveal well worn armor and several daggers around her waist and boot tops she reaches in to a purse at her belt line and hands the server a few silver pieces and telling her to bring more ale when this mug was finished the serving wench smiles takes the money and walks back to the bar.<br>
<br>
So there she sits drinking the ale seeming relaxed and giving the occasional stare to any male patron who wishes to strike up a conversation and sends them scuttling away to the shouts of glee from his friends at his failure. Occasionally she stares at the doorway leading from the tavern it looks as if she is waiting for someone.  <p>Tandari Songwyver<br>Bard of the 40th song<br><a href=http://krypteia.cjb.net>The Krypteia</a><br>Povar<br>PLAY THE MANA SONG DAMMIT</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gaelimzee>Gaelim Zee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#330000>(8/16/00 7:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> a lingering funk,a mysterious woman,and some wine</span><hr size=1> With a persisting wistfulness that has lingered on for the past few days, Gaelim is now finding mercurial solice in a bottle of spiced gypsy wine, almost finished... across the booth from her is her companion, now dozing happily, his face half sticking out from his crossed arms on the table, a sweet half-smile lingering there. &lt;When he sleeps it's as if he were a child again... innocent of worldy misery... I wonder how long it will last 'pon waking till that line of concern between his eyes returns?...&gt;<br>
He had come to this tavern at her insistance, she needed his company tonight, his honest ears, but she also needed this place, a gathering hole of yearnings and despair, all shared together, all seeking a brief respite from their daily lives, whether mundane or tragic.<br>
The wine fueled an inner glow of abandonment in it's effort to combat her melencholy, a mood she recognized as one that could get her into trouble... she was trying to decide if this was welcome or not when she noticed a stranger walk in, bringing a bit of the road with her. &lt;Yes, it's a woman... her stride... someone used to taking care of mortal business personally, but still, a woman&gt; Gaelim watched the stranger with a perk of interest as, other than Gaelim, she was the only woman in the establishment... Gaelim herself being attired neutrally boyish in order to stifle unwanted intrusions into her crafted evening of drunken outpourings with her friend. &lt;I wonder if she is on errand, or simply seeks the warmth of this place's hearth?&gt; Sidetracking her mood perfectly, Gaelim now began to ponder variations on the new patron's possible life... her imagination bubbling with drunken merriness... stringing together a thousand different tales of love and danger from her own memory and that of the collective race itself, a long strand of pearls spiralling up into the starry tapestry of night... and dreams. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/utandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tandari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#330000>(8/21/00 1:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Traveller cont.</span><hr size=1> As she sits by the fire place she looks at the other patrons around her many are human a group of noisy dwarves occupy a table across the room near the entrance to the tavern talking in their native language and occasionally get a stare from one of the Bar minders who makes sure their mugs are kept full. He knows that dwarves are notorious for their drinking and tend to get owlly if they see the bottom of their mugs to often and he decides it is better to have the dwarves full of ale and content and not empty and looking for a fight.<br>
<br>
Near the fire place sitting apart from the others and hidden in the shadows are 2 men in robes that identify them as casters before the 2 men sit virtually untouched is a plate of cut bread and 2 almost full mugs of drink they sit quietly muttering to each other and pointing aimlessly around the room.<br>
<br>
Near the bar sitting at a table were 2 people one clearly passed out and enjoying his peaceful slumber head nodding and rolling occasionally. His companion sat with his back to the Half elf but she notices that the sleeping mans companion is somehow different but can't quite place her finger on it. Suddenly he shifts in his seat and looks directly at the half elf it is not a he but a she!!! The Half elf nods her head in reconigition and gives the female a quick smile and a small wave.<br>
<br>
To the half elfs right she sees a Halfling staring at the money pouch on her belt she gets his attention with a quick wave of her hand and when he stares at her she shakes her head with a half smile. The halfling quickly finds else where to look ashamed he had been caught but quickly gains confidence when he sees a fat man near where he sits waving around a laden money pouch and watches the fat man out of the corner of his eyes.<br>
<br>
The half elven woman quietly stretches and the end of a metal flute pokes out from within the depths of her long cape. The halfling sees this and instantly knows why she caught him shaking his head he wonders idly if he could pilfer the bards flute but then shakes his head again best not to mess with her bards didn't have sharp minds and nimble fingers for nothing not to mention those daggers looked painfully long and thin and she obviously knew how to use them.<br>
<br>
The Half elven bard signaled a bar maid that she wanted more ale and again looked at the tavern entrance deep in thought.<br>

He then ran over to the arguing dwarves waving the metal stick in front of him as he did so.<br>
<br>
She continued to watch in amusement as the bar minder tried to shout over the mad dwarves shouting as they paid him no mind. Even when he hit the nearest dwarf on the head with the bar he stared in wonderment at the sharp bend in the stick and the dwarf at who he hit continue to shout paying no heed that he had been hit over the head.<br>
<br>
Finally the dwarves quietened down and started shouting for more ale and the bar minder still standing behind the dwarf he had hit over the head staring in amazement at the bend in the stick and the dwarves head and finally went back to the bar shaking his head all the way there.<br>
<br>
Not long after several men left swaying and talking and singing loudly and happily. ehind them at which the table they had sat lay 3 men who were unable to move and snored loudly and contentedly right up to the point where the bar maids threw a couple of buckets of water over their heads and awoke sputtering and cursing and to the laughter of the men around them. <br>
<br>
Slowly the excitment died down and everyone slowly went back to their drinks and talk. The bard waved her mug in the air signalling that she wanted more ale and settled back staring at the door again.<br>

&quot;Argh! I'm webbed!&quot; she blurts, and then, as if all a'sudden aware of the room, she freezes and peers slowly about, slightly giddy on her feet, her mouth caught in a surprised little 'oh'... when, with a tender rumble, a bright green watermelon rolls out from the kitchen opening, past Gaelim where she stands, and out into the general chamber with all the air and portent of a mystic comet's crossing... to go thunk softly against the chair of the seated 'mysterious wanderer'.<br>
Hoodwinked by an overindulgence in gypsy wine (as well as a most recent sampling of some rather strangely intoxicating halfling pipeweed, shared abouts a circle of her scullery friends out back behind the tavern, 'neath a starry sky filled with fireflys and the dark shadows of bats), Gaelim has a hard time keeping up with events and stares in wonderment at the watermelon... until, with a paper trumpet fanefare, out of the kitchen bounds a rosy-cheeked young halfling lad who half tumbles into the room to stand before the gathered drinkers (winking at Gaelin as he passes)! He whips off his scullery apron and flings it o'er his shoulders as a jaunty cape, and with a surprising baritone, launches into a mock drawling litany, sung in grave tones of rich timbre, about the great tragedy of Love... which serves only to preamble his fiesty and bawdy sung-tale of a halfling miller and his tardy wife which quickly gets the room to clapping and stomping and laughing in time to his dance! <br>
Gaelim, roused by the merriment of the song, laughs in wonder at her friend, and then turns to swipe the caught drapery cleanly free with a boot knife. Right on time with her cue, she launches into the 'female' role of the song her friend had started, and soon the two are galivanting around the room, trading lines in that classic halfling play, hamming it up and chewing up the scenery with every opportunity.<br>
Gaelim, loose now and comfortable, and more than well-lubricated, allows her voice to really cut loose near the climax of the song, jumping up an octive and trilling her words together in the ululating manner of the wood elves... and striking a pose of fey seduction such as was never before adapted to this whimsical halfling jig... which causes her companion to totally lose his composure, forgetting his lines and gawking.<br>
&quot;Touche!&quot; he was able to murmur before he lost himself in gales of laughter... followed by the crowd, who jokingly chided him for 'losing' the battle of the sexes and praised Gaelim for her... 'talent'.<br>
One over-drunk cur took his praise of Gaelim too far and laid an unwanted hand 'pon her arm to which she replied with a slow look up towards his face, her eyes strangely dark as wells, her lips smiling... then parting to release an unholy shriek, in a tone not heard, but felt, that caused the man to pale, his face collapsing into a soggy, weeping mass... his knees quavering... his bowels giving way... then falling to the floor and curling into a ball, sobbing with fear.<br>
The room was quiet now, and tense. Gaelim continued staring at the man with her hands clinched until her new halfling friend pulled her away towards the kitchen. <br>
&quot;Time to leave, dear!&quot; he whispered in her ear, and hussled her out the back door and into the shadows of the alley. She hoped her other friend, still having a little nappy in a booth back in the tavern, would understand her rather rude departure...<br>

The only other to notice this was the halfling thief who noted the finely crafted weapons and where they went then shook his head in disappointment he loved his hands way too much for him to lose them over those weapons.<br>
<br>
The minstrel watched as the woman and it was apparant now she was a woman and her companion left the premises quickly those in their way moved out of their way lest they themselves felt that piercing scream. After they were gone silence permeated the place until one of the bar minders shouted &quot;FREE ROUND OF ALE&quot; and the silence broke. At first it was nervous jittery talk but as the patrons imbrued more drink the tone gradually became joyful again. The only things that remained unchanged were the bards seemingly lax and uncaring way she sat and the two casters sitting in the dark corner who were still waving their hands in aimless directions and talking still in hushed tones.<br>
<br>
As the place gradually picked up in noise lvl and jovialty the bard slowly sank deeper into her chair and as a bar wench walked by waved at her mug indicating she wanted it refilled. The wench smiled at the bard and as she went to refill the bards mug wondered how many adventures she had been on, how well travelled she must be and how many people she had killed. In her day dreaming the wench walked into a lust driven drunks hands which brought her back to reality and as he groped her she deftly and efficiently rendered him unconcious with the heavy mug in her hand. <br>
<br>
Shaking her head in amusement the bard watched the display and once again got comfortable and through half closed eyes went back to watching the entrance to the tavern and half listened to the dwarves near the entrance sing a dwarvish mining song with great gusto and very off key and she softly hummed along with the song. <br>
