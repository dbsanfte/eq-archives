She ended up in this semi secluded spot because it reminded her of Kelethin.  She yearned to visit her old home in the city of trees but knew that it was futile to try to sneak in again.  Last night's attempt had resulted in the devout Tunare worshippers chasing her the entire way to Lower Faydark!  Knowing that they would not understand the reasons she had helped to defeat Tunare long ago, she swapped out her Nature's Melody (was unfortunate she had unsheathed the wrong weapon in the line of sight of a Tunarian druid, who had consequently raised the alarm) for her DotB and quickly outdistanced them.  So much for a relaxing trip home...<br>
    The songstress stretched, stood up and inspected her lute and sighed.  That Tunarian ranger must have broken one of its strings when he tried to hinder her escape last night at the border.  He might have apprehended her, but luckily she had used Fading Memories before he could restrain her escape.  Unfortunately her old lute, which had been slung over her shoulder, did not come out of the experience unscathed.  She silently apologized to her instrument, and made a mental note to find a replacement string.  <br>
    Hidden by the branches of the tree she was nestled in, no one in PoK seemed to notice her presence.  This small piece of solitude in the midst of the many people of Norrath who convene there, was somewhat gratifying.  Reluctant to leave her home away from home, she sat back down with her back braced against the trunk of the tree, and began to close her eyes to catch up on some sleep.  Abruptly she opened her eyes, startled at the knowledge that she was not alone.  Someone else had managed to breach the tall branches and was staring at her with a smirk on his face.<br>
     Seeing the guild emblem on the clasp of his cloak first, she almost let loose a string of curses, but then with a smile of recognition she embraced her bardic friend.  Draelon brushed back the loose strands of her hair which was still in a tangle from last night's race for her life, and said, &quot;Moonie, what mischief have you been stirring up now?&quot;  <br>
    Without a word, Moonspiel disentangled herself from him and jumped down from the tree, (thank the gods for safe fall) and started to run off.  She was late for her guild's raid!  Before she could get two steps away, Drae had captured her in a swift motion and said to her in their shared forgotten language of Elder Elvish, &quot;Oh no, my dear, you know neither of us can outrun each other, what happened to you, why are you such a mess?&quot;  <br>
    Knowing that he would not let her go until he received an ample explanation, she began to quickly describe the events of her night.  When she got to the part of her home people chasing after her he began to laugh.  Snapping at him, she asked, &quot;What?&quot;  <br>
    In a less demanding tone, the half elf responded, &quot;I just find it funny that your faction is that bad with your own home town, and I'm glad I dont have the same problem.  Serves you right for helping kill Mother Tunare so much last year!&quot;  <br>
    With a sly grin, she answered, &quot;Aye love, but perchance you only say such things because your guild never bothered to kill her but that one time!&quot;  <br>
    With the mention of their opposing guilds, they both grew silent, and Draelon released her from his grip.  The subject matter reminded them that they could never be more than friends, and were still enemies in many ways.  With a short bow from Draelon and a curtsy from Moonspiel, she turned and walked off to the circle of her friends gathering for their daily adventure.  Both painfully aware of each other, and at the same time doing everything in their power to avoid that awareness.  <br>

-- Some people had asked me for an explanation of my signature, and the above was a feeble attempt.. maybe will add more if I get bored.  Hope Drae doesnt kill me for posting here, seemed like a good spot for it though =) <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> Moonie<br>
