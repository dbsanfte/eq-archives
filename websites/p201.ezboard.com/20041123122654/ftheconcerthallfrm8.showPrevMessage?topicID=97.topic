I'll repost it here for critique then archive it again. I took out the monk referenses.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
there's two kinds of stacking being talked about here and interchanged randomly.<br>
<br>
First off lets cover haste.<br>
There are two basic kinds of haste. Spell haste and item haste. Item haste comes in the form of the innate &quot;effect:haste&quot; on items. The popular slots for item haste have traditionally been the back (cloak of flames) and belt (black silken sash). These hastes are innate and never take up an icon on the buff screen.<br>
<br>
Spell based haste comes from spells and procs. Any haste that's from a buff icon, be it spell (the chanter line of hastes) or item (eyepatch of plunder). <br>
<br>
Normally only one type of spell based haste is allowed and one kind of item based haste. Total item  spell haste at high level was found to be 100%. This means that any item  spell haste that added up to greater than 100% was truncated to 100% haste.<br>
<br>
For the most, the above part this was true, but bards were never part of the equation and things have gotten cloudier to boot.<br>
<br>
Bards get innate stacking just to make songs viable. A spell cast by a bard used to ignore most stacking restrictions (they fixed that for items recently) and be able to place multiple effects in the same slot.<br>
<br>
Normal song haste stacking is like all pre sov songs. What happens is that the song will coexist with other haste spells BUT only the top haste % is used. The other stats like   ac   attack   str   agil etc are the items stacking in a game sense, the target still receives those. They only get the higher % haste.<br>
<br>
say a bard using verses of victory groups with a chanter that has swift like the wind and quickness.<br>
<br>
Verses of Victory<br>
1: Increase Attack Speed by 30% (L50)<br>
2: Increase Agility by 30 (L50)<br>
3: Increase Armor Class (AC) by 15 (L50)<br>
4: Increase Strength by 30 (L50)<br>
<br>
<br>
Swift like the Wind<br>
1: Increase Attack Speed by 60% (L49)<br>
<br>
<br>
Quickness<br>
1: Increase Attack Speed for between 28% (L16) to 30% (L20) in 110 ticks<br>
<br>
normally haste in the same slot  &quot;1:&quot;    would make the two &quot;spells&quot; bounce off each other. Swift like wind and quickness cannot be cast on the same target, SLW overwrites quickness.<br>
<br>
Bard songs are different. We are excepted from stacking issues so our songs will work meaning we CAN stack verses over SLW.<br>
<br>
What results is that SLW's haste = 60% &gt; VoV = 30% such that VoV's haste is ignored completely. What isn't ignored are the stats VoV gives (the AC the str and the agility), those 'stack'.<br>
<br>
Over Haste<br>
<br>
The newer form of haste stacking comes from the ervaj/warsong line. These hastes DO stack with other hastes, adding complete confusion to most people.<br>
<br>
the Ervaj line came out in sov. It's a low % haste that adds onto other forms of haste, like chanter speed and other bard songs/clicks.<br>
<br>
Melody of Ervaj<br>
1: Increase Stackable Haste by 5%<br>
4: Increase Armor Class (AC) by 0 (L50)<br>
<br>
Composition of Ervaj<br>
1: Increase Stackable Haste by 10%<br>
4: Increase Armor Class (AC) by 0 (L60)<br>
<br>
If the chanter was playing SLW and the bard had melody of ervaj, total spell based haste would be 60 + 5 =&gt; 65%. Problem is that since most high end haste items are 40%, there's no room for the ervaj line to help anyone that has enchanter haste.<br>
<br>
Enter SOL...<br>
The Vah Shir line came out in sol partly in due to the totally underwhelming effect the ervaj line did for bards. The way this line works is that it not only tacks onto the traditional item + spell haste but also is really the only form of overhaste so far in the game (a certain earring from plane of time excepted). So far there is no known hard coded cap on over haste other than limiting how players can get it.<br>
<br>
These songs completely replace the ervaj haste line (lost comp of erjav is another beast altogether) as they not only have better 'stacking' haste but also can exceed the item spell haste cap, which makes them useful especially when the party is at max haste before the song is played.<br>
<br>
Battlecry of the Vah Shir<br>
1: Increase Haste by 15% (Above Cap)<br>
<br>
Warsong of the Vah Shir<br>
1: Increase Haste by 25% (Above Cap)<br>
<br>
Say warrior x in the above group has a tov haste item (windraider belt - 41% haste) and the chanter casts SLW on him. The total bonus iss 60% + 41% = 101% =&gt; 100% due to cap. If the bard begins to play warsong of vah shir ( 25% haste.... )The total warrior's haste is now 100% +  25% = 125% haste.<br>
<br>
<br>
The lastest installment of the bard haste saga is 'riz' from pop and 'muse' from loy as well as an expected 'echo' in Gates. all three of these song adds a cap exceeding 30% melee haste as well as a caster focus. For the purposes of this thread, the 30% haste acts just like the vah shir line.<br>
<br>
Rizlona's Call of Flame<br>
1: Increases spell effectiveness up to 15%<br>
2: Increase Haste by 30% (Above Cap)<br>
3-10: Restriction: on effect 1 (omited for clarity) <br>
<br>
The muse and echo songs just play with the caster portion of the song, leaving the overhaste at 30%.<br>
<br>
Also from my personal parses, The over haste line is an absolute modifier. When labled 30%, total haste is added 30% of base. This leaves confustion I'll try an cover in the next post...<br>
<br>
The short of the matter is that if a player is hasted +100% already, an aditional +30% is really just a 15% increase in overall haste.<br>
<br>

<br>
When using tools like lucy and eqcaster there's 2 forms of attack speed notation. Raw 'spdat' and normalized % notation.<br>
<br>
Raw information is seldom used by players but is how spell information is presented before being parsed by lucy and eqcaster, who present the information as %.<br>
<br>
Raw 'spdat' information uses the same numeric value for both melee hastes AND melee slows. The base value for a player with no hastes or slows is &quot;100&quot;; the basic value meaning the player swings at normal speed based on weapon delay. Any value added or subtracted to that value implies some haste/slow effect is present.<br>
<br>
Haste is noted as a number added to the base 100. max haste at 65 is +100% haste meaning a raw value of 200. This is most commonly attained using a +40% (100+ 40 = 140)innate haste item and a spell based 60% or higher haste buff (160 + 40 = 200cap). Note that the spdat version of a 60% spell haste is known as 160, not +60.<br>
<br>
Ironically, with the new (as of this edit) notation on all haste items, the game itself now displays *item* haste as a number like 40. Again, take a base of 100 and tack on the 40 from the average high end item haste.<br>
<br>
Slow works on the same line in that it subtracts from the base 100. a 20% slow is noted in spdat as 80. that's related as 100 - 20. As the slow % gets higher, the number for the slow gets lower meaning a 60% slow would be a 40 value.<br>
<br>
***Any form of slow completely overrides all forms of haste mods***<br>
<br>
Also, only the strongest attack speed slow effect will take effect even if multiple slows are placed upon the target.<br>
<br>
The basic reason slows are so crippling for players is because at level 65, 200 attack speed is considered normal. Any form of slow including a hypothetical 1% slow (spdat 99) would bring attack speed from 200 to 99.<br>
<br>
The popular way of writing about haste is the +% haste notation. All this really does in terms of calculating haste is remove the base value of 100. so an spdat 160 is read as a 60% haste.<br>
<br>
For slow the spdat value is subtracted from 100 making an 80 spdat into a 20% slow.<br>
<br>
Incidently, the forms of over haste are given raw values based on the % listing... Muse/riz have a 30% overhaste that's stored in the spdat as '30'<br>
<br>
<br>

I think it helps explain the intricacies on haste in EQ in an easier light.  Feel free to take whatever you want of it to help if you wish.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are 4 types of haste in EQ.<br>
1.  Item Haste<br>
2.  Spell Haste<br>
3.  Spell Haste v2<br>
4.  Spell Haste v3<br>
<br>
1.  Item Haste is the haste you get from an item (such as Cloak of Flames) as long as you have the item equipped.<br>
<br>
2.  Spell Haste is the haste you get from a buff, these haste buffs can come from a caster (or bard), item click, or weapon proc.  You will have the haste from these buffs for as long as the buff icon is still there for you.<br>
<br>
3.  Spell Haste v2 is a special type of spell haste.  Basically everything you see about spell haste can be stated here as well, with the special bonus of the haste v2 stacks with the other haste spells.<br>
<br>
4.  Spell Haste v3 is another special type of haste.  Basically everything stated about Spell Haste v2 can be stated in Spell Haste v3, with the addition of Spell Haste v3 can go over the 100% haste cap.<br>
<br>
Now, how stacking works with haste.  Each category stacks with the other categories, but the haste parts of each category won't stack with haste from the same category.  Now that I stated it, I will explain the statement.  Your haste will be based on adding up the best haste from each of the first 3 categories (up to 100%) and add that to the haste from category 4 (the v3 over cap stacking haste).<br>
<br>
Ex.  If you have a cloak of flames (36% item haste), a Belt of Concordance (16% item haste), have Vallon's Quickening (68% spell haste), Dance of the Blade (55% spell haste),  Composition of Ervaj (10% spell haste v2), Warsong of the Vah Shir (25% spell haste v3), and Call of the Muse (30% spell haste v3), you would have an overall haste of 130%, figured below.<br>
<br>
36% (best item haste) + 68% (best spell haste) + 10% (best spell haste v2) comes to 114% = 100% (haste cap)<br>
100%   30% (best spell haste v3) = 130%<br>
<br>
For the spell haste, you will see both icons even if their hastes don't stack as the other parts of the buffs do stack (like the atk for dance of the blade).<br>
<br>
P.S.  It seams that Lucy will denote the percent item haste on an item by the level it gives the item (the level + 1 is the haste of the item, IE cloak of flames listed earlier is listed as Effect Level: 35) <p>With a wine in her hand and a song in her heart,<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>

It's an increase in # of swings <br>

one last bit to add here that needs to be stressed if not already covered....<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
***Any form of slow completely overrides all forms of haste mods***<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This rule applies for NPC's as well. By this I mean if a pc lands a melee slow of any form or %, all haste buffs on a mob is over written as long as the slow remains up.<br>
<br>
This is doubly important now since gates has a very high number of shaman and chanter npc's that can will and DO buff the living !@#!@ out of the surrounding mobs in range.<br>
<br>
For NPC haste, and alternative to dispelling their swift like wind (ouch) is to simply land bard slow on them. Bards have many forms of melee slow all with different resist rates and durations so feel free to be creative.<br>
<br>
Cleaning this thread up, will hall of fame it soon.<br>
