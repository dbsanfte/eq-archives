<br>
<br>
Maerah watched, fascinated, as a ranger sprinted forward and sprang gracefully onto the back of the high-spirited mustang.  It reared up, pawing the air, and shot forward, kicking up dust in the large corral.<br>
<br>
She turned her attention to the side and watched a paladin carefully finish grooming her charger; its coat was magnificent and glossy in the sunlight.  The creature’s shoulder was taller than the top of the bard’s head, but the paladin swung into the saddle with practiced ease.  The sight of the noble champion and her steed took Maerah’s breath away.<br>
<br>
“Ohhhhhhhh…” she whispered, enamored, and thrilled to think what was waiting as her mount.<br>
<br>
“Ms. Souldancer?  I think I have a proper horse for you.  Since you said that you’ve never ridden and, well, your statue is somewhat … petite…I think we should go with a pony.”  The groom said, walking up to her and leading the shaggiest, most maltempered creature she had ever seen.  Maerah watched it try to bite the young woman, who deftly avoided its yellowed, thick teeth.<br>
<br>
The pony was barrel-bellied, fat and obviously not happy at being taken from its pasture.  There were burrs and mud snarls on its coarse coat and its tail was tangled and dull-looking.  Its stringy mane hung in a bushy mat over its hidden eyes that, no doubt, shot daggers at its new owner.<br>
<br>
She stared; speechless, at the cranky equine apparition and looked back wistfully at both the paladin and the ranger’s sleek purchases.<br>
<br>
“No, I think I changed my mind.  I’ll just run it.”  She said hastily, backing away from the groom and her intended purchase.  The young woman sighed and nodded, then called back over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
“The bard won’t buy it either; get the paperwork ready for shipment to the slaughterhouse.”<br>
<br>
Maerah stopped in her tracks, looking back incredulously.<br>
<br>
“You mean you are going to kill it?”  she asked tonelessly.<br>
<br>
The groom nodded, “We have to turn a profit somehow, Ms. Souldancer.”<br>
<br>
In a typical impulsive bardic moment, shrugging distastefully at the crabby pony, Maerah agreed to purchase it.  As soon as the money was exchanged and hands were shaken to close the deal, the bard found herself staring at the world just a few feet higher from the back of her mount.  She looked around, trying to gather what little of her confidence she could, and held her head high.  Sensing the import of the moment, the pony lifted its tail with a snort and defecated.<br>
<br>
The groom raised an eyebrow at her in bemusement, to which the bard responded with, <br>
<br>
“Well, what’s this things name anyway?”<br>
<br>
The groom smiled and started back to the barn to get a shovel, “We call him Weed.”<br>
<br>
The bard sighed.  Nothing like arriving in style.<br>
<br>

<br>
“I’m trying to explain our very important tactics, Weed and you aren’t listening.”<br>
<br>
Maerah patiently crouched by the Western wall of Freeport’s gates and continued to scratch what seemed to her to be a very accurate map of East Freeport into the dirt.  Weed, her trusty, if not scruffy, mount, stared at her with a vilified expression and tried to figure out where to bite her.<br>
<br>
“See, you balked at going into the tunnel and the sewers – so we have to head through East Freeport to get to North Freeport.  But see, those guards there don’t like me much – they know I am a Knight.  I tried to disguise myself, but the wig keeps falling off.  Right, so anyway, we have to head through the gates, past four guards and the militia house and swing around to the left and up the ramp.  That should take us to North Freeport where we will be safe in the protection of the Knights of Truth.”<br>
<br>
The bard looked up at the fat pony.<br>
<br>
“You think we can make that?”  <br>
<br>
Weed responded to her query with a snort and put his foot in the middle of her drawing, obliterating it.  <br>
<br>
“Good idea!  Destroy the evidence!”  Maerah crowed, and crawled into the saddle.  <br>
<br>
The pony trotted toward the gates of Freeport until the guards called her to halt and walked forward, snickering at the site of a bard on a shaggy pony.  Nervously, Mae urged Weed forward, hoping he would begin his shambling canter past them.  To her dismay the pony planted his feet, lowered his head like a bull and glared menacingly at the approaching militia.  With sickening dread, Maerah realized that she only came up to the standing guards shoulders on her mount.  So much for intimidation.<br>
<br>
“Hold there, Knight!”  Guard Odus said sneeringly, reaching out to grab the bridle of her mount.  <br>
<br>
Weed reacted with alarming ferocity, lashing out his teeth and taking a chunk of Odus’s unarmored bicep.  The enraged pony wheeled to the side, striking out with two solid hooves into the second guards stomach, denting his breastplate badly and flinging his back about ten feet.  Without hesitating in the shock of the moment, the vicious pony launched itself forward like a shaggy black missile through the gate of Freeport.  <br>
<br>
Maerah, still not quite sure of the whole physics system required for this Ride / Balance thing, squealed in surprise and almost fell off.  She managed to grab the reins, but slid off the side of Weed, archer’s arrows whizzing by where she had just been in the saddle.  Terrified and ecstatic at the same time, her arms wrapped around Weed’s neck and her leg curled around the saddle horn, Mae hung on for dear life.  <br>
<br>
Weed pounded through the gates, crashing through merchant’s stalls, scattering chickens wildly, people fleeing before the insane pony.  In the confusion and chaos that ensued, at least one bard took notes, inspired by the drama unfolding before him.  Two dwarven fighters, resting at the gate before their trek to the Lavastorm Mountains, looked at each other in disbelief, three words on their lips.<br>
<br>
“Dwarven War Pony.”<br>
<br>
Weed hurled himself toward the welcoming safety of North Freeport and galloped past the goggling Knights of Truth, coming to a halt inside their sanctuary.  So abrupt was the stop, in fact, that Maerah lost her grip on Weed’s neck and went sailing forward into on of them, knocking them both to the ground in a jumble of armored body parts.  She sat up immediately, grinning brightly at the young, flustered Knights whose chest she sat on and chirped, “Thanks!”<br>
<br>
She hopped to her feet, eyes full of her now placid pony and patted his neck, <br>
<br>
“That’ll do, Weed.”  <br>
<br>
His only response was to try and bite her hand absently.  <br>
<br>
She walked calmly from the scene of vendor chaos not 30 feet away, the stunned stares of the Knights of Freeport following her.<br>
<br>
Once around the corner, out of sight, she jumped around, doing the touchdown dance and spiking her gauntlet on the ground.  <br>
<br>
“Oh Weed!  You were magnificent!  Those guards!  I thought we were sunk, but you saved the day!  Wow!  You hate EVERYONE not just me!”  <br>
<br>
She danced around a little more, tugging Weed toward the bard’s guild.  The groom, a human apprentice, looked down at her pony distastefully.  The other horses kept in the guild’s stable were sleek, light and fast.  Knowing his duty, he stepped forward.<br>
<br>
“Shall I care for your.. erm…mount, Minstrel?”<br>
<br>
“Yes!  Yes!  Could you, perhaps get him a bit of horse food?  Whatever is the best you’ve got.”<br>
<br>
“Horse food?”  He sniffed, “I have some hay I will get.”<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh good.&quot;  Maerah ducked out the door and went in search of an understanding beer, not bothering to warn him about the biting. <p><IMG
