a) 3 midgets with shirts that say &quot;too hard&quot; &quot;too easy&quot; &quot;just right&quot; are set to combat - what's that? The midgets testing Emperor Ssraezha lost to &quot;too easy&quot; 14 times? Give that snake TWO DEATH TOUCHES!<br>
<br>
b) I heard on the test server, you just ask for shit and they make you 65 and give you 1000aa and phat lewt, unlike Legends where I heard they do the same after they get your VISA. Man, there'd be 10 000 people on test, but downside is you have to put up with Adewale.<br>
<br>
c) During betas, random goobs /betabuff different classes they always wanted to play but have no real talent for and run around in gear that even people on FV wouldn't have considered &quot;uber&quot; 3 years ago. (A 65 bard in goddamn NTOV gear? Sweet mother of christ.) That or random players are lumped together and set at it. <br>
<br>
d) On test, the local talent was well in line with normal servers. They tested the planes, they tested kunark and life was a-ok. I mean, some shit didn't work but they /bug reported what they saw and the developers did as they could. Plane of Hate? Sadly designed for looks with pathing as an afterthought - man, that got beat into the ground for testing. Then one day, some kobolds started dropping Nagafen loot. Oops. By coincidence, GMs had also be giving out phat lewt like a drunk man tips in a strip bar. So, they wiped test. Then one of the testers went TOTALLY BONKERS and posted a how to guide for Veeshan's Peak before anyone had even gotten there. (The fabled end zone to kunark, even though they gave some press guy a testing account and he took a pile of screenshots while testing and published them for Gamepro - Whoops!) Having dropped the bomb on each other, there wasn't much left to do but the players to requip, now a few months into Kunark as production was getting into VP. Some people like Brad made an effort to extend talk to they players but well, where's my 8 manastones bitch? Test fell far behind, but new players filled in where those who quit over the wipe left off, and everyone slowly replaced their loot. Fortuately, there was a great developer named Poe who  (who was a little too intense - less coffee there, noch -k?) used the local talent to test content. Things were a bit spotty, and it didn't seem like his bosses much cared for the test players but it worked pretty well and eventually the other devs began to come to the players for testing. Wow, golden age. Breen beat us to death in Kael over and over, Rich Waters ran around shape changed into Kelorek'Dar scaring people shitless - good times, good times. Then Luclin came out. A lot of people couldn't play owing to Umbra, and somehow retards like Dazzler Twodirks kept getting Beta invites, even though every dev I ever tested for always made some crack about that one, and this other guy named Hurk. Hey, it takes all kinds. So then one day I see Poe's basic design doc for Ssra on the safehouse. Well, now we're screwed. Furor suddenly posts under someone else's account on the SoL beta board and it gets shut down later that day. Oops. Noch, previously intense is now pretty much the farside of fucking bitter it seems then he left for EQOA and that was sort of it for test's connection to the developers. So uh, this other guy Valdelmar set up something with the local talent... Seems Seru was a nightmare, and they needed him tested. Well, we must have been killed by Seru 90 times in 4 days. But the devs are really happy - we adapt to changes they make, and soon after - people on live are killing Seru. Test, knowing he's a bit of a dead end focuses on Ssra. Vald is the man - but then uh, he left for Blizzard. Akkirus uses us to test the ring events. Breen uses us to test Vex Thal. Oddly, both seem to disappear but at the time we have no idea where. At this point, I quit EQ and didn't come back till PoP. From what I heard, AL did almost all the testing for it. Dunno, could be wrong. Anyways we're progressing through PoP a few months behind the curve, doing the reflag thing when I come back. Suddenly, things are clicking nicely. We make it to time, and of course, the Zek boys meet us - and they don't use astroglide. Well, we get past them and phase 5 gives it up like a Clinton intern. Wow, Quarm - pleased to meet you. Couple quick forays and we're 41% - Woo. Then GoD goes into testing. Crap. We can't raid on test, and test on Beta at the same time. And half the raid force can't even ZONE on the beta server. Joy. People quit in droves while we doing the GoD test thing. When we get back to test, the zek boys don't work - they just pop through walls, back to bind et cetera. They don't get fixed for well, months. As of now, where the top raid guild on test had 90 or so active players - they now have 45. The next raiding guild down has yet to kill an elemental god that I know of, and just did their own &quot;recruit / reflag&quot; tango.<br>
<br>
So i figure what'll happen is this. Employee X will be in charge of bringing some production guild over to test for testing. (Sure the test players are legit and competent, but hey - screw them.) Then after some success, he'll quit and go to Sigil or Blizzard and it'll all fall apart. But hey, nice PR coup for the time being eh? The player summit to me is the same thing Test server has seen before, on a smaller scale. Somehow, test usually gets screwed. Your mileage as the masses may vary. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6116" target="top">Shaenera of Test</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viante>viante</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 275<br> <font color=#330000>(6/8/04 4:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19477.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How DO they test anyways?!</span><hr size=1> More paragraph breaks.<br>

Since I'm Adewale, I should note to all potential test players, I quit and sold my account. Test is free again!<br>
