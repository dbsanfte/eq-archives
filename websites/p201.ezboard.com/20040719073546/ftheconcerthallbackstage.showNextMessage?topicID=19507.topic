EQ traders has some ideas and usally some ignorant way to go about getting your skills ups via 50 diffrent recipies for 100 skill ups.<br>
<br>
What i am looking for people to post on here is the fastest and easist ways to get you skill up from one to 250ish in all the trade skills.<br>
<br>
Please dont post with your opions about tradeskills themselves lets just keep this a nice informative post.<br>
<br>
Example of what i am looking for follow.<br>
<br>
For bakers there is a simple and easy way to get from 1 to 191 only utilizing 2 recipies.<br>
<br>
-TOOLS: Split, Fillet knife, Lion meat-<br>
First till 143 grab a fillet knife and spit then head to either the buther in thurg or the gnome lady in shadowhaven near the nexus pool.  buy lion or bear meat and combine with fillet knife in spit.  you will get your knife and fillets on sucessful combines and only your knife on failures.<br>
<br>
-TOOLS: Split, Non-stick frying pan, Lion meat, Bread, Cheese-<br>
Once you hit 143 load up on lion meat leaving only a few slots empty and head to jaggedpine forest camp. (trust me its alot easier to do it this way then having to run back and forth, hopefully you will only have to make one triip).  Once you get to the camp search for the man/woman who sales the bread and cheese. Combine 1 meat, 1 cheese, 1 bread, and pan. Sucess yeilds pan and patty melt, failure yeilds pan only.<br>
<br>
+++++++++++++++++++<br>
Now this is as high as i ever got with my necro and befor the new tradeskill system came out. I hope that alot of you have good tips for all of us i know i am looking forward to it<br>
<br>
Ps: for all you bard remeber to use your int song along with a KEI and int gear, this helps alot on all but smithing.<br>

This isn't a tradeskill board and tradeskills have extremely little to relate uniquely to bards. If you can't find the information you need at EQ Traders you're probably lazy or don't know how to parse information intelligently. There is no better source for tradeskillers than that site. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viante>viante</A> at: 6/17/04 12:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ruldarswiftnote>Ruldar Swiftnote</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Honored Sponsor</span><br>  Posts: 1356<br> <font color=#330000>(6/17/04 12:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19513.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fastest way to 250 - Trade skills</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com">www.eqtraders.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyepez>kyepez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 139<br> <font color=#330000>(6/17/04 1:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19513.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fastest way to 250 - Trade skills</span><hr size=1> You'll find all Tradeskills to be relatively easy to skill up on particularily at the beginning.<br>
<br>
Smithing:  Welcome to Thurgadin and No Drop Tempers!<br>
JC: Thurg or wherever easy<br>
Archery: if you got plats you can take archery up right in PoK doing bows.<br>
Baking: Pretty easy just some running involved but easy--Mostly jagged pine and Shadowhaven<br>
Brewing: Shadowhaven can take it right up<br>
Pottery:  Tainted essences and a Cleric to imbue gems from 216 when Tainted Triv's<br>
<br>
Tailoring:  There is no easy way to skill up on tailoring unless you have Shei shears.  you can take it to 187 in Gunthak but past then it's ALL HECK.  Terrible.<br>
<br>
What to start buying en masse in the bazaar:  Tainted Essences, Acrylia, Velium, FLAWLESS hides (mebbe othmir). and Griffon Meat/Anaconda meat.<br>
<br>
EQ traders will fill in any blanks.  But really it's either 1) Time or 2) Plat and the amount of plat you have will only decrease the time you spend. but nothing will ever make it *easy*<br>

While you think it's easier to use one recipe to go from 0 to 191, for example, your skill up rate will be slower than had you chose to make items closer to your skill level.  If you choose items relativly close to your level your chances for success and, therefore, skill points are better.<br>
<br>
Raising a skill from 0 to 180 is easy.  The skill ups come often even on recipes that trivial much higher than your current skill.  The points between 181 and 220 seem to be the hardest to get.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with Viante's response, but you're not asking this question in a way that most people will respond positively to.  You may think all the people making skill up suggestions using many different recipes are ignorant, but you couldn't be more wrong.  They are basing their opinion on what they know about the formula used to determine if you will get a point or not and their impressions after GMing a skill, more than one skill in most cases.  Phrase the question differently and you may get a better response.<br>
<br>
EQ Traders has the best information available.  I suggest reading the forums and finding the information you need there.  The &quot;Learn a skill&quot; guides are nice, but most of them are outdated.<br>
<br>
FYI -   I have GMed 6 of the 7 skills so far.  I speak from experience.<br>
Baking 250+trophy<br>
Brewing 250+trophy<br>
Fletching 240<br>
Jewelcraft 222<br>
Smithing 221<br>
Pottery 220<br>
Tailoring 176<br>
<br>
PS - High INT works on smithing too.  If you use a geerlock (5% mod to skill) the max you need to cap the skill is 240 points.  I have done litte farming on my way to GMing the first 6 skills.  I have spent about 300k pp so far.  If I choose the solstice robe route I could spend 200k or so more from what I read.  If you don't have time or money don't bother GMing anything other than baking or brewing.  You can GM those for under 1000 pp net cost easy.  Based on my skill up path I'd put the skills in this order from cheapest to most expensive:  Brewing, Baking, Jewelcraft, Pottery, Fletching, Smithing, Tailoring.<br>
<br>
Viante, I decided to edit your reply to show you how it could have been informative without being insulting.  I originally got on your case for being such a jerk in your reply, but decided this way is better.<br>

I didn't have enough plat to get all the way to 305 int on gear along. I stopped short at 260+. But add in KEI and song and I had no problem maxing int. <br>
<br>
While it may seem a tad bit odd to have a second set of gear just for tradeskills, you will thank yourself in the long run becuase we all know the higher the int/wis, the faster you skill up. Now there are a few trades that have secondary skills that if set high enough will also help skill up but they are far and few. I always shoot for INT because it works across the board.<br>
<br>
250 and trophy on all trades but smithing and tailoring but those are 223 each so I am not far off from being done <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

OK, I missed this. Of course, when I did my original taking of tailoring to the 131 it's at now, all the eqtrader guides were OLD - I'll have to go look for new ones.<br>
