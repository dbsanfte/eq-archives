His fingers, gnarled with age, moved dexterously with no wasted effort. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am glad you have come, Souldancer. Tonight you will share in the drum circle, an honor that few outsiders will ever experience. The spirits speak strongly in you - through you. We have heard your songs of Velious. You understand the way of the Shaman - the hardships of the Frozen Lands.&quot; <br>
Maerah stood quietly, her head not lowered, but her eyes averted from his form. She chuffed, to signal acknowledgement and respect. When he raised his face, it was etched with the deep wrinkles of the Northern sun-squint and criss-crossed with the scars of past battles. <br>
<br>
&quot;Go to the women and prepare. Tonight we call to the Spirits of the First Day to give us strength and guide us through the coming year.&quot; <br>
<br>
She slammed her first against her chest almost painfully, and backed out, remembering her Northern manners. A tall barbarian woman, who dwarfed her in size, met her at the door and grunted. Mae barely came up to her hip. All she could see was plaid. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am Cloughdah. Come, bard&quot; <br>
<br>
These people waste nothing, not even words... Mae thought and followed after her to the women's lodge. She was forced to trot to keep up with the woman's long-legged stride, and was aware that the children stared at her openly, whispering to each other and giggling. She almost smiled when she realized that she was perfectly their size. Cloughdah lead her to a low lodge as the sun began to set on the frozen tundra. She could see smoke rising from the center vent and hear the bustle of people inside. <br>
<br>
Maerah's eyes began to smart as soon as she entered the darkened, long room. It was filled with Halas shaman women, preparing for the nights drum circle. A firepit was set in the center, dug down into the dirt and stacked with thick stones. Two younger girls, not yet in puberty, and seeming apprentices, threw herbs and twigs onto the fire which flared up brilliantly and released thick pungent puffs of smoke into the stagnant air. She could not identify the scent in its complexity and layers. Her head began to swim. It was unbearably hot and stuffy, and she glanced around, suddenly aware the younger girls were staring at her. Before she could react to their giggling, an earthen ware mug was thrust into her hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;Drink this.&quot; Cloughdah said and moved away through the crowd. <br>
<br>
It tasted of grit and Mae tried not to grimace. She felt her bile rise, and started coughing. The women around her laughed, speaking in a guttural tongue at each other, nodding approval. It was apparently a good omen that she had not vomited immediately. <br>
<br>
Good Goddess, remind me to ask Tundera what this is! Mae thought...the last clear thought which floated through her mind. Her body convulsed once and she knew she was going to be sick. Barely making it out of the door off the lodge house, she was sick in the snow. When there was no longer anything left in her , she cleaned off in the fresh snow and stood. Though she should have felt drained and weak, power flowed through her - into her, drawn from the earth around her. She received the Land's power gratefully and felt the thrumming begin as her heartbeat began to sound loudly in her ears. The rhythm had begun. She felt the pull back toward the fire - toward the purification. <br>
<br>
She stood in the doorway of the lodge again, moving through the women, stripping off her armor and dropping it as she went. Standing naked and uncaring in front of the fire, she let the heat and the smoke cleanse her. She ran her hands through her hair, causing it to stick up in angled spikes wildly and felt the impurities of her life sweat from her body. <br>
<br>
Unconscious of nearly everything but the thrumming of her own heart, she was lead from the fire and doused with freezing cold, clear water. She cried out numbly, her senses screaming in sudden, sharp alertness. The beat jerked and lurched as her heartbeat nearly faltered. Hands moved from the darkness and painted ancient symbols on her body, twining up her legs and arms, across her belly, thighs and breasts, and down her spine. She felt able to pick every sensation her body experienced at once - there was no longer any sense of time or order. It was simultaneous. <br>
<br>
She was wrapped in the furs of the great white bear and watched each hair on the pelt move and sway with the rhythm in her head. The painted tattoos came alive and writhed on her body, slipping off and dancing into the fire. She watched this in amazement and felt her dragon drums thrust into her hands. As she registered the presence, the women, as a group, moved down through a flap of deerskin at the back of the lodge. They all held drums of various sizes and sets. She watched their tattoos, pulse and twitch, jumping finally into the small fire. <br>
<br>
Then they were outside in the snow and the darkness. <br>
The bonfire was huge - it would have licked the bottom of Kelethin's floors. Men and women threw bales of herbs and scented woods onto the fire - causing the smoke to rise and drift in plumes. Drums were everywhere and the shamans packed into a tight ring around the fire. Her heartbeat thrummed louder in her ears, and unable to bear any longer, her thumb struck the dragonhide of her drum and it rang out clearly. The other shaman were drumming now too - their heartbeats aligning with their instruments. She watched in fascination at the huge sets of mammoth hide drums longer across that even a barbarian man. Many shamans gathered around these, slamming their fists and drumming out. The sound rose until she could not breathe, the drumming of the earth, the calling of the spirits. There was nothing but that one, universal heartbeat. She was one with it - they all were. As the moon broke from through the low clouds and the snowy tundra sparkled in the night with a lunar glow, the single, thrumming was forced into a prism and splintered into many rhythms all blending and swirling together in her head. <br>
Men and women, rose to their feet and began to dance in a slow circle around the fire. Maerah watched, still stamping out her own rhythm, as they twisted and jumped around the fire, blurring into each other. She was pulled to her feet found herself pushed to one of the mammoth hide drums. She squeezed in, like a piglet to a nipple and reared back, slamming her fists in time with her own heartbeat. She closed her eyes and felt the power ripple up through her feet and out through her fists into the drums. Drumming until she could not longer feel her arms, her face turned to the moon, the spirits singing through her body. <br>
<br>
The dancer's pace became more frenzied and she saw them fall to the ground in pairs, writhing. Some of the drummers broke off and ran from the circle, howling like wolves and disappearing into the night. The bonfire, roaring a background to their rhythm, continued to pump out smoke and incense. Maerah's eyes were tearing, her body, trembling with exhaustion. Wolves ran through the dancers, weaving amongst the drummers. She felt their soft fur brush against her legs. <br>
<br>
Her senses were overloading and she felt dangerously close to being mad. There was a primal line she was approaching rapidly. There was a hand on her shoulder, yanking at her furs. She turned, snarling, and tore at the hand with her teeth. Never without my permission! It withdrew in a snap and she leapt from the drum circle with frantic speed and dashed out into the darkness. <br>
<br>
Two wolves ran with her, beside her, as she raced across the open tundra. Miles fell behind her as the spirit wolves kept pace with her, guiding her. With purpose and determination that was not her own, forced by an instinct she had never known, she sprang in a few leaps across the river her footing sure, balance perfect. She crouched, snarling and caught the scent of her prey, her fingers hooked liked talons, the night wind ruffling her white furs. The spirit wolves lifted their noses and howled and she joined them, then leapt after them through the snow toward their enemies. With a nearly effortless 40 foot running leap, Maerah landed squarely in the center of the open Frost Orc temple. Her wolves brothers stood next to her and lunged at the followers of the evil shadowknight. Redwind, purple and majestic in his rigid fury, roared in rage and surprise and Maerah darted in at him, nearly knocking him to the ground with the overwhelming force behind her small frame. He raised his thick paw at her and pain seared across her body. <br>
<br>
She heard the sound of tearing and growling, and did not know if it was she, the wolves or the orcs who made them. <br>
