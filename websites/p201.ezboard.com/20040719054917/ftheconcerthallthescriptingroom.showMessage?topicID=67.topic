<br>
I slept for what seemed days, just drifting back and forth between light and darkness, Galiaya always at my bedside watching over me. What I found odd is that every now and again Galiaya would excuse herself for a few momments, and I would hear the strangest sound...I'm never sure how I would describe it, but I would swear there was a green light that followed it. She would then walk back in, pardon herself for having left for a momment, and sit back down by my bedside.<br>
<br>
Soon I regained enough strength to move about freely again, not without some minor pains, but I was able to manage. I would try to help out with what I could, but I would never wander outside, I was too afraid of what I didn't know. Worry often got the better of me that if I stepped outside, the dream would fade and I'd be back in the sewers, starving and freezing to death.<br>
<br>
I was saddened as I had not seen Duloran since that first day, the one where I had a face to match the voice. When I had started to lose hope that he would not return, he came in, hollering at Galiaya to help him with some packages and to do so quickly. They both came in, Galiaya smiling as happily as ever, and Duloran...He was drenched! He smiled in spite of himself and they both set out to placing the packages onto the table where I was seated.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Aren't you going to open them Leansi?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Duloran asked, the smile never fading from his thin lips.<br>
<br>
I looked up at both of them, and Galiaya nodded her head to me, so I started to open the packages, the first, a small pack, and inside it was a scroll! The writing was familiar to me, and as I went over the words, I looked up quizically at Duloran...<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;It's a song?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Yes,&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he replied, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;when we had found you it was your voice that led us there. I only thought it right that you take up practise as a Bard once you were well enough.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I went to comment, but Duloran would have none of it. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;There will be no arguing in this, I have already spoken with the head of the Bards Guild in North Freeport, and they have dates set for your lessons. Now, open the rest of your packages, and get ready, we're going out.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> With that he stepped out of the room, Galiaya, coming over, hugging me, then bustling off.<br>
<br>
Opening the other packages I found clothing that was set to my size. It was heavier then what I normally would wear, mainly made up of chainmail, or ringmail...I always got confused between the two. There was also a set of bronze vambraces, oh how they shone! It almost hurt my eyes when the sunlight through the window poured over them. I picked up all that I could carry, and brought them to my chambers to dress, having to take several trips, and found in another backpack some food and drink in some slots, and a whip? I had to laugh at the image of me trying to use such a thing, but closed up the pack, threw it over my shoulders, cringing a momment at the weight, adjusting it, then set out to find where Duloran had gone to, finding him waiting for me by the main door.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Great! It suits you perfectly! Come now, we don't want you to be late for your first lesson!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> At that, Duloran opened the door, took my arm and led me outside. What a sight! All the people roaming about, the merchants, the travelers! There were just so many people! <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Now stay close Leansi, it's too easy to lose oneself while here...&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Spoken all too late, I had already slipped his arm, and was roaming about just lost in the sights and smells, I started to laugh in spite of myself, and held my arms out wide, twirling in a circle, and as the sky spun about me, I smacked straight into a pillar, and landed on the ground, bottom first.<br>
<br>
Next thing to happen was about as frightening as it was silly...The pillar moved and then grabbed me by the arm, pinching my skin beneath the bronze vambraces, and lifted me up off of the ground! I let out a horrible scream only to realize the pillar was nothing more then a very tall, very heavily built man, who did not look too happily my way, his armor shining in the daylight, his eyes barely visable behind his helm. I think I started to say something, but only remembered him shouting out, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;What do you think you're doing?&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I tried to appologize, fumbling for the words as his grip tightened on my arm...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Put her down Lucan! She didn't mean any harm, now set her down and let her be!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> With that, I was dropped, landing back into the sandy walkway, cutting my hand open on a stray shard of glass. When I looked up, Duloran was standing before the one he called 'Lucan', nearly growling at him in a language I couldn't understand. A momment later, Lucan spat on the ground by Duloran's feet, then walked past me. I sighed with relief a momment too soon, for he turned back, and locked eyes with me...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;Watch your step brat, count yourself lucky this time. Just remember, Duloran won't always be around to save that hide of yours!&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I swear I had never had a chill like that before, even when I was in the sewers with all of the rats.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Don't pay mind to him Leansi, but don't anger him either. It's best to keep away from West Freeport, and him. Come, let's get going, we don't want to be late.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> With that, Duloran helped me up, wrapped a bandage around my hand, and led me off for my first lesson. <p><font face="Viner Hand ITC"><font color="#FBFFFF">L<font color="#EAF1FE">e<font color="#D8E3FD">a<font color="#C7D5FC">n<font color="#B6C6FA">s<font color="#A5B8F9">i <font color="#829CF7">V<font color="#7F8BF1">o<font color="#7B79EB">n'<font color="#7868E5">Z<font color="#7557DF">a<font color="#7246D9">r<font color="#6E34D3">o<font color="#6B23CD">v<font color="#5C1ED4">i<font color="#4C19DB">c<font color="#3D14E2">h<br>
