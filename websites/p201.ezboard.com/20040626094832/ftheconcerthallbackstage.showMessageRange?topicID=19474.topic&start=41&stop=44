<br>
I just want to point out that &quot;broadsword&quot; is a term that was never really used until the ninetheeth century. At least not according to what I've been tought. Broadsword was used as a catch-all phrase that included all swords broader than a thin fencing sword. In other words, pretty much all swords...<br>
<br>
Also, a claymore/claidhmore is a scottish double handed sword. What Mel Gibson <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>should</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have been using in Braveheart. Instead he's carrying some sort of German zweihander. Which wasn't invented in another 150 years or so...<br>

<br>
I mean In this day and age, nothing is unique, 99.999% of items are mass produced down to clone status, even most hand made items are merely hand assembled.<br>
<br>
If you think about it, our pervasive out look is summed up by a paper milk carton. A milk carton is just that.... go to any food market in the us and theres 100+ identical half gallon waxed paper carton milk containers..... the milk but be different but the basic carton isn't. Drink the milk throw or recycle the carton with ZERO care of it's special status as a clone.<br>
<br>
Go back 200 years and there were no milk cartons, there were bottles I'd imagine if anything but prolly just buckets from the cows. I mean hand made glassware was for the rich.<br>
<br>
Same applies to weapons/swords. Each was it's own creature and even if europe didn;t give an eff what happened to the weapon after the fight (oh well get another 5 pollaxes made) many cultures (e.g. japan) venerated individual weapons into entities of their own identity and power. I mean to this day a 1000+ year old katana is sitting somewhere with a name and is unique unto itself.<br>
<br>
So back to those barbarians we call europe in the 15-18th centuries....<br>
<br>
Swords basicly fall under how they are constructed. The two main indicators are handedness and cross section.<br>
<br>
Handedness - One handed? two handed? one or twohanded both?<br>
<br>
The basic arming sword (what we think of as a broad or long sword even though both terms are so greviously wrong) had a flattened diamond or hexagonal cross section.... and was one and two handed... how ambiguous can you get.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.vikingsword.com/vmuseum/vmo1e.html">www.vikingsword.com/vmuseum/vmo1e.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
 is about all I could find of an easy hexagonal cross secion, diamond is merely missing the rods that are in the center of the picture. Hexagonal weapons used the parallel section for more weight.<br>
<br>
The rapier was an evolution of the arming sword with the military version going to heavy armor piercing and duelists heading to lighter faster. At one point people started calling them different but it wasn;t overnight. They were typically diamond for the lighter weight.<br>
<br>
So eventually it was possible to manufacture a triangular cross section and that in itself was dubbed the smallsword.... a rapier is typically diamond and could be double edged, the smallsword only could have one cutting edge for most of it's length. You'll see the very tips of many triangular swords sharpened on the back edge to help thrusting.<br>
<br>
An epee is a term for a type/evolution of smallsword near as I know because by definition, an epee has a  triangular cross section. I just don;t know much past the 18th century as I have zero interest in sport fencing. because honestly, by the 19th century the sword had been completely replaced by the gun for duels. Think of the small sword like a pokemon....<br>
<br>
Smallsword evolves into epee<br>
pikacho evolves into pikanikachuu  (or whatever)<br>
<br>
so anyway for fencing that I know of, the overwhelming popular weapon is the rectangular (read non flattened dimond) foil.. It's floppy and relatively safe to use (I mean for goodness sake it's a bloody sword). Epees are basicly refined smallswords and I could only imagine it';s dangerous and less popular, a search on google would give you an idea I guess.<br>
<br>
My room mate years ago had a foil behind the door that he used for stage productions. it was a real life fencing foil albeit really messed up one. It was flexible and was square.. if you picked it up by the blade and twirled it with your forefinger and thumb, it'd cut you but in no way was it a cutting tool.<br>
<br>
Btw a saber is just a curved smallsword/epee. the saber was favored by the cavalry and used mostly as a slashing weapon. The basic crossection is again... triangular.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are people that fence with epees and sabers I guess, and google backs that up. Other than that look for someone else cause I don;t care for sport swords.<br>
<br>
So yes, there's epee's, no they were too late to ever be used in a real fight. Sabers lived on well into even World War I because the cavalry used them and man if there was ever a group so effing clueless, it was them. Ok here's one word name that signifies the end once and for all for any sort of horse mounted cavalry on a real battlefield...... MAXIM. Google it if you have no idea what I'm talking about. Then again doubtful google will connect that name to the machine gun for the first 10 pages of results. So ironic people flock to a name that has so much death surrounding it.<br>
<br>
If one loves swords, I'd suggest you look into japanese weapons because those people actually care about their swords and have them from many many many years ago.... something europe didn;t care about.<br>
<br>
One overarching theme I find in term of europeans and their decendant americans.. how they kill people doesn;t much matter as long as they subdue them. Europe wasn;t anything special in the 1500's and as far as civilization was concerned, it wasn;t based in western europe. <br>
<br>
The one thing that changed all that was gun powder. I mean europens weren;t the ones that invented it but they sure as hell ran with it futher than anyone else thought to.<br>
<br>
Consistantly, europe was the area to keep pushing the envelope, never satistied with was they had but always looking to best their opponent the next hedge over. That drive led the world to the wonderful flower of death we lovingly call the machine gun ala Hiram Maxim. The american inventor that couldn;t sell his self named tool  and requisit smokless powder to his home country so he packed his bags and headed to europe where he received knighthood from the queen of england for this little toy.<br>
<br>
That tool alone helped england hold onto their widespread colonies but an amazing thing happened.... No one stopped to think what the maxim would do on a european battlefield.... Welcome to the 20th century guys!<br>
<br>
From the machine gun to poison gas to firebombings to nukes, amazing europe is still around what with all the help America has given them..<br>
<br>
Overall, the sword was a means to an end for europeans. That means was replaced by first the pollaxe in the 15th century and finally the macine gun in the 19th century... incidentally just about the time europe could finally make a decent sword - it was beyond merely obsolete.<br>
<br>
The sword for Europe was always much more a symbol than a useful tool. And as such, off the battlefield, lots of sword running about!<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

oh if the machine gun info sounds like fun try <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWmaximgun.htm">This short bit about the maxim</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> I mean in all honesty the machinegun sums up European/American culture real nicely... it's a child of the assemply line.<br>
classic quote...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
In 1881 the American inventor, Hiram Maxim, visited the Paris Electrical Exhibition. While he was at the exhibition he met a man who told him: &quot;If you wanted to make a lot of money, invent something that will enable these Europeans to cut each other's throats with greater facility.&quot; <br>

follow the link to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWvickers.htm">The Vickers</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> too which was really just a maxim with another name. The production numbers gives you an idea how clueless europe was to how their colonial operations were keeping up with the world when war broke out in 1914. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=liquidated>Liquidated</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/11/04 9:53 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=19474.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=19474.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=19474.topic&start=61&stop=64>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showPrevMessage?topicID=19474.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showNextMessage?topicID=19474.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19474.topic&index=44><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.emailToFriend?topicID=19474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.threadControl?topicID=19474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19474.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p201.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theconcerthallbackstage">Backstage<option value="theconcerthallcenterstage">Center Stage<option value="theconcerthallontour">On Tour<option value="theconcerthallthecriticschair">The Critics Chair<option value="theconcerthallstageleft">Stage Left<option value="theconcerthallfrm9">The Voting Booth<option value="theconcerthallfrm7">The Adventurer's Tavern<option value="theconcerthallthescriptingroom">The Scripting Room<option value="theconcerthallthegiftshoppe">The Gift Shoppe<option value="theconcerthallfrm8">The Hall of Fame<option value="theconcerthallfrm12">User Interfaces<option value="theconcerthallfrm11">Admin<option value="theconcerthallfrm13">Thread Trash Bin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall>The Concert Hall - Message Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage>Backstage</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31o<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
