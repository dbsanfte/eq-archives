Every now and then you'll get one of those fat rooms where you either get a lull on a central mob or get ready to use FM to split a 5+ swarm.<br>
<br>
Many, many hards later it's pretty routine now.<br>
<br>
Lull does have its place in Hards.  However, you should focus your split work using mezz &amp; snare.  The only time I break out Lull is to separate groups of 4+ mobs by breaking the agro chain.  Otherwise, as others have eluded to, the high resist rate makes it too time consuming.<br>
<br>
With a 305 cha I find crit resists to be very rare.  Frequently less than 1x per dungeon.  Also, the mezz resist rate does seem to be quite improved by the high CHA.  The shaman I group with most often hits me with the CHA buff automatically now.<br>
<br>
Best advice I can give is get as much FT as you can via augs, AA abilities and gear.  You're going to need to fade from time to time and with a little bad luck or a whopper room you may need to do it several times. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub147.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=triliansoulwind>TrilianSoulwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#330000>(3/17/04 11:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallontour.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=307.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lull doesn't belong in hards</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I've only done one hard, and it was apparently the hardest (Tak).

Really?  I've seen perhaps 5 rooms in hard LDON (I haven't done a guk, but I've done lots of the other four) over all the maps where I get more than, say, 3 at a time.  If/when that happens, I usually fade off and snag a couple singles.  My normal hard group can handle 4 though (my shaman always malos' everything very fast, as per my request) as long as they come in STAGGERED &lt;--that's the key.  Most pulls are 2.  I could probably pull 80% of every hard ldon with ANY class and be okay, because it's all about recognizing what mobs will come and what mobs will not come.  The other 20% of the time, I actually need to split, and when that time comes, I /hug fading memories and split <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I'm a little lost here.  You keep mezzing them.  If you have 2, HoS-&gt; mez, toggle, HoS-&gt;mez, toggle, rinse repeat.

I acutally use lull fairly effectively now (at first the resist rate and chance of crit failure made it pointless...but back then a single hard mob could eat me, so I wasn't really ready for hards).  Now I use cha song, then lull and can usually get 1-2 at a time (of course I can also spot when lull isn't needed).  I like lull because I don't like to fade unless it is absolutely necc. and lull can often split 1-2 mobs out of a pack before you even start your pull.  I use the mez trick too, if I have 2, mez one off a little ways, get the other to camp and mez it, then re-mez the first one.  I tend to set it up, so I basically always have 1 mob mezed in camp (or in the doorway to the room) when the previous mob dies.  I like to use HoS on the pull so I have a better chance of landing my initial slow, but otherwise don't use HoS because mez resists are rare for me (I use the 65 mez, but don't have max cha or anything).<br>
As stated, the key to pulling hards is to have atleast 1 room or hallway between your group and the stuff yer pulling at all times (yell at your group if they move up early...that's fine in normals, but it's a no-no in hards).  Also, as stated, you simply have to keep trying hards until you have your own strategy worked out and know exactly how you want to pull.  Eventually you will figure it out.<br>
I've never had any trouble with the mobs in Sro...never been able to figure out why people think Sro is hardest...Nro or EF is the hardest of the hards to me (due to mob placement and MR).  I can however second that CHA helps with resist rate of lull, critical lull, and indeed MEZ (chanters mezing in rathe prove that cha makes a big difference in mez resists).  I've also heard that singing mod affects resist rates on lull and mez(the singing versions), but never actually tested it or seen test results. <p>Impressario Minerian Lutestrummer, lev 65 bard<br>

The bumps, the up and down, the water, the twists - I find that I often get stuck when trying to kite, build space, etc. I've been doing better lately, but it just can be a challenge as I'm trying to split.<br>
<br>
Like Minerian, I wasn't ready for hards when I started, but now have over 7k hps, full defensive AAs, FT 14, etc. My advice is to stop and think for a moment before pulling every room. Each room is it's own pulling challenge. If you can mezz/split, then do so. It's far more reliable than lull. If you can't, figure out which one to lull to get the max effect. You're unlikely to be able to lull more than 2 before the timer wears off. Definitely use the cha song and consider buying planar power (cha 305 is the win) if you're going to lull. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub147.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wyndaria>wyndaria</A></span><br> Posts: 201<br> <font color=#330000>(3/29/04 5:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallontour.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=307.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> My regular hunting group had our first unassisted Hard win last night, and I can tell you.

<br>
We did EF and had 20 mins left at the end.<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, for the bards at the semi-lower end, like me, try using tribute points to get FT4 (only costs 29).  With ornate boots, the FT1 earring, and MC1, plus tribute, I was able to fade every 9 mins. ...  FADE IS KEY!<br>
<br>
Pull 3?  mez one, run, fade.  You got 2.  Or, pulled 5?  You messed up, but heck, mezz some, run, fade and see what you get.  Or, not sure what yer about to pull?  Just mez and see what happens...  9 min fades are the win and I'm gonna use tribute for FT everytime from now on.<br>

Yay!  <br>

Oh, and I got two +7 char aug drops last night, so maybe I'll get less resists... heheh.<br>

I have to say with FM and Mezz pulling ,its by far the best method of pulling , If you get 3 , snare 1 and or Mezz 1 and fade . Let the mobs split themsleves and begin pulling . Ill never go back to normal LDON's.<br>

<br>
There is one big thing that seperates the good hard LDON pullers from the bad ones, the good ones are going to con every mob before touching them, and con every mob that might assist that mob.<br>
<br>
Lower level mobs assist shorter ranged calls for aggro, so sometimes lower lvl mobs that would add if they were white wont add because they are blue, just like you can single pull all day any camp 11+ lvls lower till u are blue in the face since aggro range modifiers make assist aggro pretty much disappear in those cases most of the time.<br>
<br>
If you have to decide which of the 2 to cast on, cast on the blue one, I prefer mez on the blue one straight off and then remez if it didnt take instead of wasting time HOSing, mez has a fairly good land rate on the blues in 65 hard.<br>

don't be afriad to kite the pulls around the room before, or even in your groups room till u can land a mez<br>
a well placed lull to break the chain, pull with mez, get 2 on the pull, mez one.....bring other to group, then head back to mez the first as its INC to your group, recylce to your first mezzed, hit it again and usually your group will have the first one near dead......mez fades and boom, you got another mob right as your group finishes off the first<br>
was a thrill to say the least, i think i like ldon<br>
