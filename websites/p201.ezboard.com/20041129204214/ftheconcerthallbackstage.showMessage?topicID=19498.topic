Dont get me wrong, I am not happy with bards role in pvp or with pvp balance in EQ, I get more HTs on my server than probably rest of lvl 65 bards combined (averaged 5 a day + courtesy manaburns/lifeburns) but I am simply tired of adapting to changes nonstop and with the direction changes keep taking.<br>
<br>
Basically from what I read in supposed changes, new changes wont please anyone and will piss everyone off. Lets face it, when you nerf SKs half of hardcore PvPers on pvp servers WILL be pissed. They created and geared SKs for sole reason of PvPing, not like their characters are going to be suddenly in high demand other than PvP. Same happened to bards a few ago and as far as I know a lot of them quit. Now we are looking at Sk exodus from EQ?<br>
<br>
The people who are &quot;supposed&quot; to get PvP boosts but arent really getting it are melees. 50% increase wont really do shit for them and they arent in it for the PvP to begin with. I mean people make warriors with PvP as an afterthought, balancing PvP for them is &quot;nice&quot; but really, its not what they are in for and there are far far far simpler ways to balance melees for pvp which SOE keeps ignoring.<br>
<br>
The death of Melee pvp abilities came with the Pumice nerf during Kunark I believe and Golem rod nerf later. Why bother with making dispells go after random slots to bypass instaclicks if you can simply put pumices back in game? along with golem wands?<br>
<br>
I mean, for ANY melee, 50% range increase wont do shit against 7-9k buffed casters with instaclicks, levitates and runes. And as long as you can interrupt a warrior trying to dispell the dots a necro stacked on him while having 0 channeling there wont be balance in PvP.<br>
<br>
Now resist changes. Ok, I understand it becomes a problem with PoTime+ guilds with resists capping at 500 and people being literally immune to casts, but honestly... do we really want wizards nuking from levitate spots with complete impunity, druids being top pvp class and necros owning everyone just because they are necros?<br>
<br>
I am just going to ignore pvp server, I am sure I can adapt to whatever they screw up now, but I am also afraid this will ruin skill based pvp as we know it now and become class based and gear based pvp, with twink wizzies running levitated and nuking people for 40% 3x and most importantly people quitting game because all of a sudden their carefully developed pvp characters all of a sudden being nerfed into running from a 2 week playtime &quot;NEWEST HOT PVP CLASS THANK YOU VERANT&quot; kind of char.<br>
<br>
This was the reason why I quit UO. Constant rebalancing of classes when I was forced to basically rebuild my character every month from scratch because they kept &quot;rebalancing&quot; PvP. At least in UO it took a week of macroing. In EQ its simply not worth it.<br>
<br>
Look, rebalancing after 5 years is bad. Tweak classes and listen to feedback, dont do anything as drastic as u proposed, u wont please many and u will piss off a lot. But o well, not like Verant ever listened to any1. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=suladasbardspeed>Suladas Bardspeed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 329<br> <font color=#330000>(6/14/04 8:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19498.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Going to boycott PvP test server.</span><hr size=1> regarding exodus...keep in mind SK's got R**MED by GoD...that, and PvP population is like what, 5% of all servers? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://img65.photobucket.com/albums/v199/klondorwarrior/orginal_copy.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
HT needed to be nerfed and alot of what the poster said is very very true.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I got nuked by a wiz for 2250 non crit and all my resists are over 300...this is on VZ, not the beta server.<br>
<br>
They've got the right idea...faster kills. Faster kills by everyone needs to happen because the number one thing to ruin pvp in EQ has been HP gear.<br>
<br>
People have so many HP that any shmuck that isnt rooted can safely get from Qeynos to Freeport before they get to 98% health.<br>
<br>
They should have worked to make pure melee a tad stronger and made pure melee a little more immune to player spells. Along with bringing back golem wands/pumice and making one handers hit harder, not 2 handers, and stuff would have been kinda ok. Shaman needed help too.<br>
<br>
So bard dots are landing again but they're nerfing mana drain? What's the point? Back and forth we go, they nerf this then that...as the poster said.<br>
<br>
What's died has been one on one pvp, which so many of us loved. It seems the only answer has been to encourage the zerg more and more in pvp. Wizards are going to be the new SKs though, I agree...<br>

This is about fact that they will revamp whole PvP system and it will take them 1 more year to rebalance it. God forbid during that time oow comes out and they will put off fixing things they messed up in PvP to fix bugs in oow.<br>
<br>
OK, current system isnt perfect PvP wise, but it is workable. It isnt broken with gaping imbalances and horrid bugs. DX9 syndrome anyone? Look, people were pissed to the point of quitting game with DX9 &quot;Fix&quot;. With our luck, pvp changes will be even more bugged and imbalanced. Someone correctly pointed that we are mere 5% of EQ population, so FIXING what they broke in pvp balance will take less priority than fixing what they messed up in OOW. Hence, we are looking into 6 months to a year of completely BROKEN pvp. Not imperfect as it is now, but absolutely BROKEN.<br>

bs. Have you even read the rest of your own post?<br>

<br>
I'm glad we're getting a PvP balance. The Zek playerbase has crying out for one, <i>at least</i> since the Luclin release.<br>
<br>
SoE have had several years of feedback, and now they're acting on it, you're gonna start moaning?<br>

while it's fun, unless they are logging every spell casted and the status, every melee hits, it's too chaos to actually &quot;test&quot; anything at this time.  there is no solo pvp (unless you are under 61), it's a big messy fight of My server Vs. rest, in pok and nexus.  maybe after it cools down a bit it'll be different.<br>

VZ and SZ are the two servers made known, battling between nexus and pok. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-family:Times;font-size:medium;">Impresario</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Times;font-size:medium;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120074" target="top">Cerezo EdgeWalker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The GMs were there watching and getting feedback, I chatted with Rytan for a while last night about first impressions, bugged lame ass leg slice, etc etc.  I'd imagine specific things would be hard for them to catch, so you'll need to post or /bug in order to get them noticed.  If you got nuked for too much, be specific (as in what spell/class/etc), so they can try to isolate the problem. <br>
<br>
Heh, RZ was there btw - We had a pretty small force on last night but we still went after everyone else we could, mostly fought in pok.  Pretty chaotic for now, but I think it may get a little more organized once guilds are set up on test and maybe some of the other zones come up, people can spread out a tad all the pvp isn't concentrated in nexus/pok/pot.<br>

<br>
As for balance, what is the reason you think we recruited/leveled/geared 15 sks for? As opposed to 15 monks or rogues or warriors? You dont think we geared and recruited all those people so they can stand there and look pretty? Did you think it was easy to do?<br>
<br>
Look, if it was fixed 1.5 years ago when our war begun, i would understand it, but now that we sank 18 months into building pvp force, nerfing our efforts is kind of gay..<br>
<br>
Its not like we werent underdogs to begin with. And our best pvpers are still not Sk's.. well Gicar is most definetely one of our absolutely best (saw him obliterate 2 MiM sks in CoD just jousting), but rest are people like Isseldeur and Orraden.. those arent SKs..<br>
<br>
Sks just provide us (finally) with high end positive kill ratio as opposed to &quot;make them zone, get healed by boxed clr. and zone back in&quot; ratio. I mean 90% of our casual pvp takes place in BoT, its almost impossible to score a kill there unless you HT or opponent is utterly retarded. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=occlusion>Occlusion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#330000>(6/15/04 4:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19498.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am a bit..</span><hr size=1> The 50% melee range increase is very, very, very nice.

It's funny to enter PoK and see all the familiar names, but fighting together for a change.<br>

Amusing to see the SZers ganging up to kill people off other servers... especially seeing as the majority of us are 2 or more expansions behind on gear.
