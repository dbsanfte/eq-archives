Each of those 53 people have full class appropriate buffs, each has 305 of all important class stats, each has 500+ resists, each caster has FT15, all melee's have have 2200+ AC, each character has years of experience playing their class and is very knowledgeable about their class(yea right), all your wizards have appropriate GoD familiar and pays attention(lol), this is what is being talked about.  What bard buffs will help this group?  The bard is marginalized because there is cap on stats, ac(well kinda diminished returns ect), resists.  No one will ever complain about mana song, but really, with fast and furious fights, and such a high mana regen in this group already, it is also marginalized.  Riz doesnt stack with the new improved damage wizard familiars.<br>
<br>
It took bards to get this group to this point, but now they arent really super necessary.<br>
<br>
We have been at this point before.  Increases in stat, resist,  and AC caps smoothed it over.  Well that and overhaste...like the evaj line ...lol.<br>
<br>
Raising caps across the board, adding in % spell mitigation with resists in a song, adding in % damage mitigation with AC buff in a song will help solve this problem, without giving soloers any power.<br>
<br>
Bard stacking on raids beyond 2-3 has been a problem off and on throughout eq.  Its no different than alot of other classes, I just kind of accept it and move on.  You want to be a star, be in a guild with 1-2 bards, you want to feel marginalized be in a guild with 6-8 bards.<br>
<br>
I only see this as a problem in the highest end of the game.  It will eventually be a pervasive problem for all bards if it isnt addressed.  If caps arent raised, you can imagine the gear and stat items and 5 more levels will make alot more bards feel the heat.<br>
<br>
I think we will be ok when OOW comes out, Im not particularly worried about it.  The people on the cutting edge may have to suffer a bit until then.  <br>

(We are a casual raiding guild).<br>
 So, tellin me a druid can't keep a place in a CH wheel then? Spam heals from healing classes wont hold up against tvexu? Would think nothing less than a 11-12k tank of whatever class at that level? <br>
Tell me a pally, shaman and druid can't heal as well as a single cleric and I would truly be surprised. And yes, up to GoD you can have a raid with no clerics, rezzing sucks but it can and has been done. I didn't say some classes cannot do stuff more efficiently than others, thats their strength. Curous though... Someone out there has never had a pally/sk tank Quarm? Maybe not to start with(after all, it is a warriors strongpoint), but that got the job done? Would be surprised. Bards are meant to be a fill in the gap type of class, as I said before. My point still stands, and consider back when LDoN came out. most folks wouldn't consider going into a hard LDoN without a cleric...<br>
Talidd, as you pointed out, may be possible going ahead in gear an expansion and killing the expansion before material with less than optimum groups? It's my point, exactly.  Clerics have a role, bards have a role, our role is and always has been utility, not being a one trick pony on a raid. Like a buff bot.<br>
Some expansions, some classes get to shine better than others, according to some end-end game folks, it isn't bards. So what? I can still be good at my job, and still be a benefit. Ok, so my buffs are useless at a certain point according to Racket, could be... Gotta find other stuff to do then that is of some use.. Hmm, HoS/slow incoming, mez adds faster than the chanters, pull if I get the opportunity to or want to, add a nice DS to help tank maintain aggro..etc. I guess I just refuse to feel inferior because I don't do any one thing as well as any class that has it as a specialty. Guess I will see what it's like in time in GoD high end, and I know I will find a way to be useful there, too. I am sorry for those of you that don't. <br>
Also, I am not saying that we shouldn't get songs that make us be of even more use, but I imagine I will always feel useful. I am too versatile not to. At least as much as that 4th shammy is... If only a warrior can tank in high end GoD raids, what are the SK's doing? Pallies can cure and heal at least, what about them? We as Bards have just been spolied for a long long time. I liked it, don't get me wrong.<br>
When I feel I have no use, and stop having fun, I will stop playing, after all it's just a game. <br>
Curious point tho..On Tunare, the top end guild still is taking bards as applicants, and they have several very good ones, guess they found a use for them after all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wildcarddesigns.com/images/edsigb.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
also, how do you figure a DS helps a tank maintain agro?  90% of the mobs after KT in god arent' mezzable, etc.  we dont really need to go on to show you dont' have a clue what you are talking about when you say the high end bards are doing fine.<br>
<br>
Do I feel inferior?  No, I know i'm a good bard and outside of highend GoD content, I'm still VERY useful.  But at the high end game we all hate to see ourselves become useless.  When bards have minimal effect on a raid(resists, stat buffs, overhaste all being minimalized as an effect), how many bards do you want to take on a raid with only 54 open raid slots.  This isnt about bards not being useful at all, but at this point once you get past 2-3 bards on a raid in GoD, most other classes add more to a raid for those precious raid slots.   Yes its an issue, when you have 60 people wanting to join a 54 person raid, the least useful classes are going to be made to sit out.  No we havent had that issue with bards in my guild yet as I was the only active full member bard for the last several months.  But we have more bard apps because of people wanting more bards for time, what are we going to have 5 bards do on GoD raids? <p>Impresario <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5127" target="top">Taleren Bloodsong</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=talerenbloodsong>talerenbloodsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/23/04 6:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=falundirxviento>Falundir X Viento</A></span><br> Posts: 189<br> <font color=#330000>(7/23/04 6:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19613.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ameritech.net/users/cjs27/ava.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Haha.

I think it could be done, would love to try.  Knights can do fairly well when they have all the shielding items they can get from Time.
