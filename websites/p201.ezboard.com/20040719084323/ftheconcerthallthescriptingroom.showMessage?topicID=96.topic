It was another frigid day after my journey on the gnome vessel referred to as the Icebreaker. I really had no idea what to expect in this new land. Being from Kaladim and more at home underground I quickly felt the hair rise on the back of my neck with this pressing feeling that I was being watched. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I looked up ahead and all around, I could see only rolling dunes of solid white snow, with a few trees here and there. I checked my rations and realized that I have only enough for a few more days. I had no idea this journey to the lands of the rumored coldain ice dwarves would be so long and arduous. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I rounded over the top of the next dune the hairs on my neck and face began to shiver. I look over my shoulder, hear a faint growl and the next thing I know my face is in the snow. Sharp stabbing objects and claws riddle my back with a pain that has never felt so intense. I scream for help. <br>
“Oh Brell, father of below, please give me the power to heal my wouuund…..”  I begin to speak but a claw catches me across the face. I see my attacker has the face of a lion with the most horrifying blood red eyes I have ever seen. The creature has me pinned; “I’m going to die.” I think to myself. A huge tail rises into the air above my head that has a stinger similar to a scorpion tail I once saw in a library book back home.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I close my eyes and hear a rhythmic beat that can only be the sound of my heart about to rupture from the intense fear that has me completely paralyzed and at the mercy of this creature. When all of the sudden I hear a growl and the weight is lifted. I open my eyes and a man dressed in the most fantastic armor I have ever dreamed about is swinging a glowing sword that emanates the most beautiful music and a rapier that is dancing in his other hand.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The creature locks eyes on his new target snarls and begins to attack. The man, who could only be some type of bard, begins to sing a song that is completely incomprehensible to me. Music flows from his lips and surrounds the creature binding its feet to the ground. Suddenly the tone of the song changes to an intense scream that makes me cover my ears. I stare in complete disbelief as the creature begins to walk away. The bard walks slowly behind it dicing the creature with his weapons, he changes his tune again. This time it is a rhythmic rondo. As soon as the song is in full repetition I could swear to you that he began to swing faster and his blows became more accurate! All of the sudden a flash of light occurs and I have to turn my head. The bard begins to swing at a lightning speed and his attacks are even more precise that before! The dancing of the blades is mesmerizing. All the lights and music are simply incredible and I find myself smiling at the spectacle. Soon the creature falls to the ground. The bard kneels down, takes his singing sword and carves away the mane of the lion creature. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you sir, you saved my life. I owe you everything.” I say as he looks in my direction. He is wearing glimmering armor all over his body, gems glisten from deep within the dark gray material. His legs are the color of beach sand but are scattered with inlaid gems and blue crystals. The rings on his hands are made of an enchanted ice-like material and glowing with fire. I stare at the pendant on his neck, it is silver and has an engraving of a magnificent dragon eye on it, and a serene feeling of tranquility covers my body. This man is a friend to all. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Not a problem.” the man says. “Name is Lotte. Think you’ll be ok?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was almost in shock; this is Lotte! The famous bard I had heard stories of all the way back home. “Ye-yes sir, I think I’ll be fine. Oh Brell father of below please give me the power to heal my wounds.” My wounds disappear a little bit. Lotte walks over to me, pulls out a mystical lute and begins to play a song. My mind becomes more focused and my wounds seem to regenerate. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Don’t call me sir,” he smiles, “I said my name is Lotte.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well Lotte I can’t thank you enough. I have heard stories about you and your friends. After today I believe they are all true. What was that thing anyway?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “A manticore, they are pretty mean; but their manes catch quite a nice price with the coldain.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Coldain? You know of Thurgadin? That is where I’m headed but I am a little bit lost.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, if you head directly…” he looks into the distance and points, “that way.. kind of south west. You’ll enter a large canyon that leads to the great divide. Thurgadin is behind the waterfall if you follow the mountain range to the right from the canyon. Watch out for mountain giants though. Some of them are meaner than the manticores.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Boy you sure know a lot.” I smile “I bet you have traveled everywhere.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hah, almost everywhere. The eastern wastes are pretty tame compared to most other places in Velious. You just be careful, friend. I wish you the best of luck”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My name is Terve.” I say, “I truly wish you the best my friend. Thank you again.” As quickly as he appeared he was gone. All I could see was a ball of light floating in front of me with the sound of a drum all around. On the ground dropped a bottle marked Fizzlecutters Formula 5000 and a rolled up package of very light weight food. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “See you around, Terve!” Lotte’s voice emanated from the air around me as the ball of light flashed off to the northwest; it was completely out of sight after a few moments. I put the food and drink in my pack, looked around, grinned and began walking towards Thurgadin. <br>
