I don't see how these things are supposed to be done when you &quot;Only have a short time to play&quot; or when soloing while waiting for a group?<br>
<br>
I have too small a sample but it seems that these tasks are uneven in difficulty and reward.  I don't think many people are going to use them after the first few experimental disapointments.<br>
====================<br>
Tasks have a 15 minute timer between completions so you can't just grab another right away.  Also you can't multi-task the tasks.  Even though the window looks like its designed to show several open tasks, once you accept a task the NPC will refuse to give you a new one until you have finished or cancelled the first.<br>
====================<br>
Here's my experiences so far.<br>
I've kinda taken a break from the high end game.  My RL best friend got a new job and can no longer play on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
So I started a newbie on a different server.  I figured it would be like the good old days: no twinking, stuff you can solo, short CR's if you messed up, etc.  Well it's been interestsing.  I actually stayed in the tutorial (glooming deep) until I dinged 7th level.  Everything greened out at that point except 2 mobs.  Afterwards I immedeatly bound myself in PoK but went back to my newbie zone and tried to get my newbie armor.  Its very time consuming and almost not worth it.  You get tons of some things and then you gain 2-3 levels before you get the last piece for the combine.  By that point you might already have enough plat to buy better in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
I digress.  Anyway I decided to try a few of the tasks from the task masters I figured I could get a little extra exp while leveling.  I've tried 4 different tasks with 2 different characters so far with rather mixed results.<br>
 <br>
I tried a &quot;medium&quot; task called &quot;orc crushing time&quot; with a 7th level character :<br>
1. kill 10 orc centurions<br>
2. collect 4 orc pelvis'<br>
3. hand in the 4 pelvis' to a new NPC at the CB zone in.<br>
Reward: I recieved 4 GP, 5SP, 8 CP and only 2% exp (at 9th)<br>
<br>
I dinged to 9th level and died 4 times in the proccess and still needed 3 more pelvis'.  The only reason I got the other 3 was because some uber was slumming and had left the bodies to rot.  I found the pelvis' I needed in a pile of lego corpses they'd left at the zone in.  Legos were still very dark red to me at 9th level and only soloable with a skin like nature, regen, storm stregth and a 24 pt DS I got from a passing druid.  Killed one that way, got killed by the second.<br>
<br>
Then I tried another &quot;medium&quot; quest with my now 9th level character.<br>
1. run to the faerie camp in LFaydark to get the rest of the quest.<br>
2. kill 10 skeletons in steamfont (they con blue to yellow)<br>
3. collect 4 bone chips.<br>
4. ????  haven't got  this far yet.  probably a hand in to an NPC.<br>
The skeletons I was trying to kill were at the dragon bones in steamfont and I could not solo a yellow con.  Most of the time I would get 2 -- a blue and an even con.  Then I'd have to run to akanon.  (guards did not help)<br>
<br>
On another character, an 11th level mage I tried 2 tasks.<br>
First, I tried a &quot;short&quot; tasks. Something about scouting land.<br>
1. Go to the goblin camp outside of Dagnor's cauldron.<br>
2. Go to the west side of the basement in the PoK Llibrary<br>
3. Go hail a troll NPC who is sitting on the rim of the pit in the field of bone.<br>
Reward: about 1.5pp and 15% Exp.  15% exp!  for 5 minutes of running around and I didn't have to kill a thing.<br>
<br>
The other one I started was also &quot;short&quot; and it involved looking for &quot;ancient burial sites&quot;.<br>
1. Check out the guard hut in BB, west of kaladim.<br>
2. check out the stone tower on goblin island in Ocean of tears.<br>
3. ??? didn't get this far.<br>
I don't know which island they meant.  Aqua goblins or the island south of the Erolisi sister island.  I assumed the later and headed there.  Surprise.  Everything conned red  and I didn't really see a stone tower.  I gave up.  <br>
<br>
Please bear in mind this character is a untwinked.  Wearing burlap armor and only enough coin for a few spells.  I figured if my invis dropped I'd be dead with a long CR (either drag corpse back to sister island with a swimming skill of (10) and no EB or try to loot fast on the spot and gate before agro). <br>
<br>
So of the 4 tasks I started, one gave great exp and was easy but the challenge for the others was set kind of high and the reward seemed low.  <br>
<br>
Some guildies were saying the level 65 tasks they tried involved looting a bunch of rare drops off mobs deep in Droga.  Hardly soloable except by a few classes and not quick by any means.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Went to the guy in DL, got the task.. <br>
<br>
1) go to some spot in chardok, get flag, zone out<br>
2) go to some spot in LOIO, get flag, go to veksar<br>
3) go to veksar, kill 10 GREEN MOBS (ok 2 were cyan) in an area very easy to get to for a bard.. zone out<br>
4) go to DL to finish task.. get less than 1% real exp, 116 pp plus all the plat I looted from the sentries in veksar.  Gained zero exp from killing mobs.<br>
<br>
Decided at that point, that tasks for anything above 65 were a waste of time and won't do another.  Tho, I must say, it *was* fast......  <p>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=53032&quot;&gt;Trilca Willowsong, Dark Horizon/a&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khalm>khalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#330000>(10/14/04 10:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19907.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone tried the tasks?</span><hr size=1> at 70 my task was:<br>
<br>
1. Start at DL<br>
2. head to FM for flag<br>
3. head to dinning area in droga for another flag<br>
4. kill 10 dark blue flamemasters.<br>
5. head back to DL<br>
<br>
reward: 20% AA and 120plat<br>
bonus: copper hammer of striking from king and some crown from a named dirt criminal near the dinning area which turned out to be worth 20k tribute combined.<br>
<br>
it took me about 30 minutes to complete and was kinda fun to do somthing other than just mindless killing of blue con mobs while LFG.<br>

at 29 i finally found someone to give me a task for my lit gnome SK and that was in BB they sent me to MM to kill 10 pledge then 10 initaite and then loot 4 rings(must do in order and must be the looter)  i did this task 3 times and reward was 12pp and 11percent of a lvl of exp.   At 31 i could no longer get this mission and then was given 3 missions to pick from all sending me to FV.   As a SK this was a bad thing but with a little prescouting with my bard i found the path of the savages I was to hunt and was able to circle the zone until i got to it. then I had to loot 4 A canines and then got sent to Tim Deep to make a very long swim and then a insane task of hunting 10 lvl 14 fish whichi i cant find ... have to use bard again to even find a path of these steamers...<br>
