Removal of ae-dmg to destroy ae kiting was a good move imo. It also could have been much worse if you looked at the original proposed change to those songs. Three versions of Rizlona's makes me want to puke quite honestly. I said it in the beginning that we were going to get fed the same shit once again with lvl cap increases. Guess what, thats exactly what we got. Whole zones of see invis mobs should be pretty shitty.<br>

I can think of alot of reasons to group a bard, which I am sure you can as well if you really thought about it. I don't think there are too many people in game with an IQ over 75 that would say a bard is a dps class and that is why they are good for groups. Non-issue imo, I think we will still get groups the same as before. <br>

Diminishing returns on having multiple bards. I cannot relate to this atm because there are 1-2 bards on most of my guilds raids, 3 tops. Lanolar I believe attested to the fact that the 3rd and 4th bards on a raid are rather useless outside of what they can provide to their own group. And seeing as groups cannot be comprised of DPS classes entirely and balance is needed in order to survive, your contribution is further limited. <br>

Quite honestly this expansion is going to either make it or break it for ALOT of people. If this expansion really turns out to be crap and further pisses people off, you will see an exodus from EQ much greater than was seen in GoD release. Its not time to hang up the drums just yet, I say give it a shot. If it sucks and your really frustrated with it then give it up. No sense playing a game that feels more like a chore than a good time. <br>

im pretty much in agreement with you on that.<br>
<br>
unless we are gonna see items other than instruments that have mods that go up to 3.4 there wont be much of an impact raid-wide for us to be 70 and decked out.<br>

<br>
AE song arguement has been gone thru enough, not covering that.  The reduction of focus songs was to balance a large mistake they did in gates by over increasing casters power with their current foci and what we could bring to the table with them.  They had little choice but to rework how foci worked with this expansion to bring things more in line without giving casters a massive power boost with this expansion.<br>
<br>
See invis mobs, well welcome to Everquest?  I've been in every zone in the expansion and no 'travel' zone will inhibit you.  You might have problems in proving grounds, but I was not only able to map the entire thing as a bard, but managed quite well with the use of mez, da, and fade.  Being a bard is about being resourceful with the tools given to you.<br>

a.  I did extensive parses in beta with time and tacvi weapons.  While the boost in dps we gained was rather pathetic imho, it still was not too far back for me to pitch a fit on the class boards.  <br>
<br>
b.  Read above on foci, you just dont understand the reasoning behind it.<br>

<br>
This applies to all bards, not just elemental level.  You also are not familure with the current itemization of OoW, so this point is also rather moot.  Yes we didn't gain any aa that affected our songs, but you forget this is an add on to gates, not a true expansion. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ameritech.net/users/cjs27/uqua.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trebla7th>Trebla7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#330000>(9/14/04 10:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19792.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OoW: The Expansion That Killed The Bard Class?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Diminishing returns on having multiple bards<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I rarely see diminishing returns when we have multiples...  granted, we never have more than 5, and yes, there are slightly diminished returns just as there are for any other class.  <br>
<br>
1 Bard:  Has to do everything<br>
<br>
2 Bards: 1 for AE mana/resists and HoS, 1 for MT group<br>
<br>
3 Bards: 1 for Resists/HoS/DoTs (for resist component), 1 for MT, 1 for Marr/group buffs<br>
<br>
4 Bards:  Same as 3, but one for more efficient pulling (in most places)<br>
<br>
5 Bards:  Most events, this is where we see the diminishing returns, but on any event that requires fast CC, kiting, HighSun, multiple tanks, it's easy to find a role.  I don't think we've ever had a Bard that had nothing to do on a raid.  And we're always more valuable than Rangers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I can't wait for this....  won't have zones that just get habitually skipped anymore...  kind of a throwback to pre-Luclin.  If it takes a long time to get somewhere, you're less likely to hop around to find the most ideal place leaving 90% of the zones empty.<br>

5 Bards: Most events, this is where we see the diminishing returns, but on any event that requires fast CC, kiting, HighSun, multiple tanks, it's easy to find a role. I don't think we've ever had a Bard that had nothing to do on a raid. And we're always more valuable than Rangers <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So let me get this straight and I am looking at the number 3 and beyond here. Where are you raiding that dots actually land still? Resists aren't always needed. HoS is a one shot deal for debuffers unless your hardcore and just twist it forever until a mob is dead lol.<br>
<br>
Way I see it is 2 bards can do everything your #3,4,5 bards are doing and then some. 4 songs is rather standard with 3 being an occasionally laggy as hell spot in a certain zone. <br>
<br>
Heh I don't see how a #3,4,5 bard is more valuable than the dps that a ranger brings to a raid. Bards are certainly valuable to raids but I really don't see what your getting beyond the 3rd bard aside from group songs and minimal dps addition. <br>
<br>
Don't take this as a flame I hope you understand I have never been in your situation so I am trying to understand it somewhat. It just isn't adding up to me.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1045055" target="top">Jimmay Jam</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
let me shed my view of it bit by bit cause well I'm hungover something ugly (no not even the gatoraid last night fully butressed me) and I cannot seem to sleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As I see it, SoE have now made their final (?) push to destroy and remove the Bard functionality as a class from Everquest 1 by making an expansion that totally removes a hard playing bard as an asset for any groups/raids; </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
What honestly are you smoking... lets take mana song alone...from a fully buffed and AA'd caster (20 ft + 3ish standing + 6ish AA + 10ish buffs like improved druid 9 + 22ish chanter...) that's like + 76ish regen standing.... add a bard to group and you improved that over 25% - mana regen is the lifeblood of casters..... <br>
<br>
what single other class can claim that??? Now what single class whose buffs are not sold for 15 pp in pok from mules?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>1. Removes several of the unique bard abilities that existed (removing AE-damage, nerfing Focus songs, introduction of whole zones of see invis mobs).</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
ok first the aoe damage songs...... You are talking to the guy that plotted with the famed 'gimp' aebriol on how to best level up twinks using aoe kiting in zones like akheva and nadox.... I didn;t waste my time like worry did (not slamming on you worry) leveling main toons up, I wasted my time leveling guild twinks which were at best a diversion, monopolizing entire zones of well over 100 mobs.  I am not one to run over people tho if you think I was training peeps - I didn't. If you want exploit level aoe, talk to the skilled peeeps like worry =p<br>
<br>
That said, aoe kiting needed to be nerfed so bad I could taste it. No class should beable to kill off an entire zone of non summoning mobs with almost no risk to themselves... if that's not broken to you, I say you best not be playing any sort of online game with other real people.<br>
<br>
As for what happened to the aoe dots? not sure... I have yet to log onwith it live, but from what I understand soe is doing their best to leave the viable aspects of pointblank dots in group  and other non mass kiting situations. That's all I ask for.... what the heck were you wanting them to do?<br>
<br>
See invis mobs...<br>
<br>
When gates first came out for public comsumption in beta, barandu was a hall way of seeinvis + see sos roamers and all ... who was the only class that didn;t mind? bards!!! Bards would selo on past it all, train or whatever, who cares, fade that crap behind the temple. clerics and palys were efffed... rogues were upset. Bards could gloat.<br>
<br>
Get this through your head.... zones of all see invis and sos mobs make zones  friendlier for bards at the expense to all other classes. If you think a mach 3 bard for a minimum 2.25 mins selo+ da + multiple 100% blur has a zone bad................ nm you are too far past help then lol.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for focus... I'll get to that later...<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>2. Positioning the Bard dps even further behind any other class in the game. With the nerfing of focus songs and upping every other class in dps, why bother grouping with a bard?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
What dps are you talking about? melee? when has bard melee EVER mattered in a group with a real dps class like a rogue or monk or ranger or sk or... etc? kinu and I have endless spats about this mostly in private but I cling to the thought (not thott) that our melee has always sucked and nothing is new.<br>
<br>
as for group dps...... well 30% melee OVERHASTE? not only can I click a group 60% melee haste from a base 40% item all my guildies have had for years, but I can then add another raw 30% haste...... that's a 15% relative increase (from max haste to bardmax). ask your best bud rogues and rangers how worthless that 15% increase is.<br>
<br>
For the argument that all you need do is add another rogue/ranger/fluffychewtoy to replace the bard.....<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
Now for the frist TruToLiq story time this post!.. oh goodness it's been years hasn;t it? I am scared to try and think back to last story time with Liq.<br>
<br>
setting was kod taz after raids with those people that never seem to poof.... group of 6 just ganking blue to red golems/lizard/slowmoving floating priest things/smurfs whatever and crap that sometimes came sowed, sometimes ran were somtimes buffed to hell and back from a passing snake with slw. standard kod taz late night fun right?<br>
<br>
was me.... a VERY drunk getting drunker Bard.... takes a sepcial beer to get me smashed and it was special beer night... too bad it's all gone now, kevin more imperial plz! I don;t remember the last two hours leading up to server down. kk thx orange gator aid for allowing me to post today.<br>
<br>
gg bellow aa and screw dememing da to fit crap like dispel for the obviously hasted snakes and golems!<br>
<br>
<br>
a GOD class rogue we will call Harvey. The one that's seriously been entertaining changing mains to bard after 5+ years of rogue.<br>
<br>
a slacker afk rogue that was the one that needed exp we'll call pookie.. GOD class cept equipment alone makes not a GOD class player<br>
<br>
GOD class tank being played by no idea who... it's all a blur<br>
<br>
new gnome cleric that has skills but not the best equipment.<br>
<br>
an afk chanter that wasn;t mezzing shit.<br>
<br>
now I was getting the second 6 pack of homebew (naw not my brew, I wish I could make beer like that) and trying to get some food down to allay the buzz for the first 30 mins.<br>
<br>
Pookie was afk, harvey was kicking ass taking names... the warrior was pulling ahile I kept songs up and trying to eat some left over meatloaf (wtf was I thinking when I made that #$%@?). Pulls were very slow but exp was steady.<br>
<br>
I got back from basic afk ville and started to pull... mob in camp most of the time tho pulling like qvic valley from SE temple area entails warping mobs to get them over quickly and I was far too out of it to get something like a lev.<br>
<br>
Fast pulls + harvey presented with aa mob's back and a warrior that remained healed = enough exp for 2 dead weights... that my songs helped harvey as much as the afk pookie mean nothing, it was all about making harvey better.<br>
<br>
Now pookie is one of the top 5 rogue s on server, no doubt there but with him afk he wasn;t doing crap... when harvey bailed on us 45 mins before server down, suddenly mass mobs nearby were there to pull and the corpse pile of not yet poofed mobs got smaller... and we managed to wipe (well warrior and cleric died) while pookie was afk.<br>
<br>
Harvey was owning pookie but don;t think I hate pookie... we all have our days. Hell I was so total not aware of wtf was going on outside of the immediate group I'm amazed it wasn;t my fault we wiped!<br>
<br>
now keep in mind the 4 aa + 2ish gl exp we got in that space of time was a total of maybe 2.5 hours total... <br>
 from waiting on the cleric to log on to waiting on a drunk off his ass bard to pull a temple full of doom smurfs in a rather unsafe (but really fast!!!) way... <br>
<br>
As a non bard looking at the group from inside the group......which would you rather have.....<br>
<br>
look for a replacement for that bard on account another top of guild rogue or ranger would account for maybe 5% more dps so long as they performed on par with the @$#@# hot harvey? or buff harvey and get boffo single(tm) pulls and mana regen and a bit of innate ds to boot? as well as click haste and sporatic selo.<br>
<br>
really no time to get replacement people or min max the group as we simply had little time to begin with and none of us were really thinking... is the choice that hard?<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The muse line alone is a relative 15% but the always on ~60%base haste without need for a chanter is not to be discounted at all, the innate damage shield we take for granted only gets better in oow, the raw attack we provide helps etc etc. we hit so many bases that no one else can touch.<br>
as for the caster focus change....<br>
As for caster focus yes we took a hit but to say we are worthless? why the drama? Muse Caster focus is not valuable for anyone unless there's a caster thats nuking or dotting. Wiz x does a base amount of damage... you tell them having a bard in group allows them to do x + n damage, they simply don;t care.... they want it!~ <br>
<br>
You know how single minded to point of comic relief the average wizzy  is when it comes to eq? They nuke they see the numbers...... if bard = better numbers then wowowow. never mind that they want you for the mana regen...<br>
<br>
yes the overall % was corrected/nerfed/fixed/broken/scoobysnacked (your pick of pejorative) for us but so too for all other caster focus items..... they got nerfed/scoobysnacked hard - non oow focus are *Half effect* at 70 I'm assuming gates muse at 70 will be 15%base as well. <br>
<br>
The idea was that by normalizing the external focus effects for casters at level 70 and planing new focus to compensate, they could improve the base values of the spell lines to compensate... well this is a bard board so I'm not even qualified to speculate on caster nukes/heals/mysterymachines.... ok?<br>
<br>
Bottom line is tho that if you think bard muse nuke/dot focus effects were nerfed just to spite bards...... you sir are saddly mistaken. This is tons bigger than bards. what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg and we are not the titantic steaming full speed ahead. We made out better than average as far as I can tell this early.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>3. Not upping IM/SM artificial restrictions so a ep geared bard have the same impact on group/raid as super high-level ones making the entire OoW expansion redundant for bards; you cant simply find anything that improves your bardic abilities in OoW if you are a elemental bard.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
well no real contest here. gates itemization sucked ass... but elemental? oh come on. I mean yes gates equipment wasn;t worth the upgrade for someone that just spent over 6 months prior to gates in time, farming every last bit of best of slot class equipment. But all that time+ikk stuff blows away elemental level equipment. The exception of course would be things like the poe drum or the pow lute but may I point you to one of the MANY threads bemoning the bard based loot drop rate in pop?<br>
<br>
as for mods... I simply do not use instrument in a group.... I haven;t for years... my mods are worn and elemental 'worn' are flat out owned by time + qvic level gear. personally I stick with time level for a minor performance hit.<br>
<br>
As for the hp and resists and avoidance and all, if you pull you can use it. I'm fortunate enough to be alongside/behind 3 GOD class monks that have a near telepathic communication in pulling for the raid. I need really never pull ever thou I let them know I am there to help any time I am allowed to (being only bard on a raid excludes me from pulling often). For that reason I get to slack on the equipment.... <br>
<br>
People whose guild relies on them to pull like kinu and bay really can't slack. And I make fun of them for my less than leet yet still nonexistant magelo. Kinu makes fun of me back ok? There's a whole lot of mutual slamming going on.<br>
<br>
For relative equipment strength tho keep in mind bards got it as good as the best of all the classes.. not a single one of our old focus effects are getting nerfed/scoobysnacked/frostymochawithlemoned such that my 2.5 brass mod on time bp is still a 2.5 mod.... I got another + .9 in worn mod to max out on.<br>
<br>
Before you wish for equipment to become obsolete, do you really want to be forced to replace equipment every expansion? honestly? Why is it so bad to be able to have the same x slot item for over a year, must one rely on equipment alone to signify growth?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>There is no use having playing bard any more, simply box 2 bards (one with AE Mana and one with AE resists) and your raid is gtg.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Well honestly you are playing a different game if you feel this way<br>
<br>
In my world of chromatic aoes that drain mana and melee/cast slow (gates owned for the exciting ways to terrorize guilds with new kinds of aoes), a bard in group is worth 3 outof group....<br>
<br>
here's a real live paraphrase (just doesn;t get any better in hungoverLiqland) from a few months ago after I got back from work in hell months when I could barely log on.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
Setting was qvic pulling the armor cows with their annoying chromatic aoe spam... in the batcave channel of leet (sarcasm) pullers/raidleaders and old school hanger ons.<br>
<br>
crankyshammy tells the channel &quot;man these mobs are trivial with a bard in group playing psalm&quot;<br>
<br>
monk with cleric 2 box tells the channel &quot; well let me get them next time cause these &lt;newpeople with not so good equipment&gt; are getting torm up, I'm 25% mana already&gt;<br>
<br>
Liq tells the channel &quot;nerf bards!&quot;<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
The rogues make sure to snag bards. the rangers gave up trying to get their own bard months ago. the clerics switched their whining to necros for feeds.<br>
<br>
One thing everyone agrees, we need more skilled bards.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I am a &quot;hardcore&quot; bard in a &quot;family&quot; guild of mostly swedish players and frankly this expansion makes me sick with disgust. Why bother to log in any more when you only contribution can be accomplished with someone 2-boxing you.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Well last I checked no ones really played oow so not sure why you are proclaming it to suck already..... I'm all for saying oow sucks but at least let it prove it's sucktasticness first ok?  People may take what you say seriously.<br>
<br>
As for the 2 box...... what one class CANNOT be 2 boxed. How many high end guilds don;t have 2 boxed clerics? How easy is it to automate a class like a wizzy or ranger using bow? How hard is it to download some evil program that's against EQ's EULAPEOTEMZIETR or whatever to automate a melee class. Why is a bard any less different to automate?<br>
<br>
Now by the same token, you want a 2 box bard or a bard that will help pull help mez help debuff help be in range for songs? what single one class benifits more than a bard being played by a skilled bard.... a chanter being played by a skilled chanter? How are they *better*? I'm all for GOD class chanters as friends mind you...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Maybe it's time to hang in the drum?<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
I;ve never been one to beg bards to remain playing their class. There's very real reasons high end bards are so rare and I'm the first to admit that most would hate it. It's not easy to appreciate a class whose real strength is in making others more powerful.. especially when there's no message that spams everyone saying &quot;player Y did x more heal/damage/scoobysnack/extrafrothylattewithgoatsmilk on account a bard is with them in group&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Comments?<br>

<br>
I'll leave you with one last bit not 12 hours ago in the above mentioned batcave channel of leet guild wanna bes and glue sniffers / pullers.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
the background bards A B C are new bards less than 3 months in guild trying to join guild.<br>
<br>
Liq tells the channel &quot; WEll so far C is really doing as well as to be expected, he's a keeper if he keeps up&quot;<br>

<br>
Specifically, I'm talking about the Coirnav and Rathe events.  Perhaps things change in GoD, doubt I'll ever find out.  Granted these are unique events, but 5 bards is barely adequate.  Edit:  by &quot;barely adequate&quot; I mean we could have good use for more, but could make do with less...  so poor choice of words.<br>
<br>
I'm going with the assumption of three songs per Bard as that's the only way to keep things reliable if you need something permanently up (like resists).  We keep HoS on constantly for named mobs as an extra 140ish resist debuffs helps quite a bit (50 or so from HoS, 90 or so from DoTs).<br>
<br>
The MT Bard really can't double up his responsibilities without hurting the MT.  Resists, HoS and DoTs generally need to stay up (save HoS) since if the DoT drops, it may not land the next time.  The third Bard handles Marr and other miscellaneous stuff...  everything listed under Bard 5 becomes that Bard's responsibility.  At this point each is performing a completely unique roll.<br>
<br>
The 4th and 5th Bards, depending on the encounter may end up being &quot;useless&quot; +DPS classes (which still isn't as bad as you make it sound, see below).  So situationally, yes, you see diminishing returns, even to the point of near uselessness if you're not being grouped appropriately.<br>
<br>
Let's examine DPS added by a Bard...<br>
<br>
Let's call warriors 100 DPS (as a point of scale), we'll say Bards do 50% since people will argue we're not where we're supposed to be.  So 50 DPS for Bards.  <br>
<br>
Rogues are around 130 then (or was it 160, haven't looked at the numbers in awhile).  <br>
<br>
30% overhaste adds 15% DPS with max haste.  130x0.15 = 19.5 per rogue.  Throw a Bard in a group with 5 rogues, adding 97.5 dps to the rogues Purely through overhaste, stack the ATK on top of that, maybe an extra couple.  <br>
<br>
Throw in Bard melee and you're sitting at almost 150 DPS from adding a Bard.  More than any Ranger.<br>
<br>
TRUE, you rarely have a 5 rogue group, but have clerics, monks, paladins, what have you.  Well organized group make-up will always use our abilities better than poor make-up. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.albrandes.com/trebla_sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trebla7th>Trebla7th</A> at: 9/14/04 2:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=liquidated>Liquidated</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='filter:glow(color=#B4A032,strength=1);width:100%'>Grumpy Moderator</span></span><br>  Posts: 3649<br> <font color=#330000>(9/14/04 2:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19792.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hahah</span><hr size=1> man the italics are unfixable all I get are html is not allowed.... well it's only the last part.... where's the effing asperin.<br>

Oh, yeah, and the points are really clear. Again, folks, the WHOLE FOCUS SYSTEM, is being revamped for levels 66-70 spells. Bards are included.<br>
