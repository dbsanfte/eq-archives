<br>
Wind brushed against leaves and flowers, catching little wisps of loose grass and dirt, swirling them gently in the air. Water lapped gently against shore, the lake tranquil, black in the light of the moon. The only sound was the gentle rustling of leaves and plants, the hoot of a night-owl. It was peaceful tonight, and beautiful as only Norrath could be.<br>
<br>
     Vaelynn stared at the still water, her eyes unfocused, her face still. Silver light bathed her, making her seem to be a spirit of the forest. Sharply defined features gave her face an exotic look; auburn hair fell over her shoulders, hiding the tell-tale pointed ears. Not that anyone could mistake what she was. At just a glance it could be seen immediately, even by those who had never met her kind, who had only heard tales and stories, handed down from generation to generation. Exaggerated versions of the truth, that's all they were. Anyone who came across her might wonder why she was there, what she was doing. But no one came across her. It was nearly midnight, and all the sensible people were asleep. The village on the other side of the lake was quiet, the only lights those that were left to allow late-night travelers to find their way. Not that very many strangers came to Resse.<br>
<br>
     "Thinking again, little one?"<br>
<br>
     The voice was soft, familiar to her as her own. Vaelynn didn't turn her head. "I couldn't sleep," she replied honestly. Her brother's chuckle was soft as he sat next to her. At a lofty twenty years of age, he had four years on her. He used those four years ruthlessly to rile her temper, but he also knew his sister knew a lot more than most her age. He had raised her since their parents had died. He was the one that pushed her on after the orcs' attack on their village, and he was the one to bring her here, the one to demand help from everyone he saw.<br>
<br>
     "The dreams again." Not a question, but a statement. Vaelynn nodded, still staring at the water. Dreams had been plaguing her for the past month. It was the same dream, with a couple variations.<br>
<br>
     Orcs raided her village, killed everyone in sight. She was in the woods at the time, at her "hiding place". She had no idea the raid had happened until she returned at her usual time, late evening. The village would be in ashes. The first body she would see was her brother's, grossly mutilated. Sometimes it was Vera's--her best friend. Or, in another variation, she would be in the village at the attack, but be overlooked because she hid in the inn's wine cellar, where she had been doing inventory.<br>
<br>
     It all ended the same. She was alone, with nothing and no one, walking along the main road, only to have a group of bandits appear. There, she knew nothing. The dream ended at the same place, every night. She was rapidly losing weight, and there were circles under her eyes the moonlight was kind enough to erase for the time being.<br>
<br>
     "I don't understand it, Dal. Why do I dream the same dream every night, every time I sleep? Is it a curse? Is it a twisted version of the past? Is it a sight of the future? I just don't know anymore." Her lips twisted bitterly as the calm she had managed to find disappeared abruptly. Standing, Vaelynn threw a pebble into the water, watching the ripples. "What have I done, to be tortured this way? Have I in some way riled the gods?<br>
<br>
     "What will bring me relief from the fear?" Her hands clenched into fists, her nails dug into her skin. She consciously, with an effort, opened her hand. Four red crescent marks stared up at her.<br>
<br>
     "I think you should see the Druid."<br>
<br>
     The statement came so calmly, so surely, it threw Dalmer's sister off guard. She turned and stared at him, green eyes wide.<br>
<br>
     "The Druid? No one can ever find the Druid. She's a myth, a legend. Surely you know that by now!" Slight scorn in her voice.<br>
<br>
     Dal smiled slightly and stood, brushing off his leather pants and shaking his head. "She's not a myth, little sister. She's simply old, and doesn't talk much with anyone. The animals are her family, the forest her home. The magic is her comfort, her life. She doesn't need us, but when we are in great need, she comes to us. If we need greatly enough."<br>
<br>
     Vae's brow furrowed. "Have you ever seen her?" she asked, still skeptical. The Druid was a myth, and everyone knew it. There was, if she wasn't a myth, only one druid near Resse. All the others were up near Kelethin, and other large cities. Exotic ones too. Like the human city. But no one ever saw her, and soon she became myth.<br>
<br>
     No one had seen her for years.<br>
<br>
     "Once. When I was a boy, eight years old. I was looking for shelter, and you were sick. I was worried that you wouldn't pass the night--you had a horrible fever and you could barely move to follow me. I had to half-carry you. It was going to rain, I knew it. I was praying that we'd find shelter, when the wolf came." His eyes looked into the distant past as he relived the memory. "I was scared, of course, but I was too worried about you to just run away like I would've if I was alone. You couldn't run, and I couldn't carry you with me if I ran. So I picked up a branch and set you on the floor. I remember telling the wolf that he wouldn't get you, and he'd have to get through me, which wasn't going to happen."<br>
<br>
     Vaelynn's smile was slight at the thought of a grubby eight-year-old orphan challenging a wolf. She tilted her head to the side. "And the wolf became the Druid," she guessed promptly.<br>
<br>
     "No." At Vae's arched eyebrow, Dal chuckled. "The wolf just stood there. He was hungry--really skinny. He was no more than a yearling, I think. It was then she came. She was dressed in green. Tunic and pants, with a big staff. Her hair was silver and her eyes were blue, and she wasn't as old as you'd think. Least, she didn't look it. She didn't even speak to me. All she did was walk up to you, and put her hand on your head. Next thing, you were perfectly fine, but sleeping. Then she picked you up and told me to follow--she had the most beautiful voice, I can remember that--and she left us near Resse. Then she was gone." His smile was bemused as he remembered. "I woke you up and didn't say anything, I just told you to follow me. Then I ran into the village yelling for help. I woke up poor Telly and the few guests at his inn. It was him who took us in, and...well, you remember the rest."<br>
<br>
     Then his smile disappeared, and he grasped her slim hand in his. "Listen to me, Vae. Seek her out. She can help you. I know she can. She has all the forest's power behind her."<br>
<br>
     "Druids are supposed to be haughty and pay no attention to peasants," Vaelynn informed him. Dal just shook his head slightly.<br>
<br>
     "Wood elves are supposed to be spirits of the forest. Are we?"<br>
<br>
     "No." The answer was grudging, and she bit her lip uncertainly.<br>
<br>
     But since Vaelynn still showed signs of doubt, he sighed and put his arm around her shoulders, hugging her close in a one-armed embrace. "Let's go home. Why don't you sleep on it?" he suggested. When his sister threw him a look filled with daggers, he held up his hands. "Okay, no sleep. Well, think about it at least," he said.<br>
<br>
     Vaelynn sighed. "I suppose," she replied grudgingly, then shook her head. "I still think she's either dead or myth, though," she muttered softly, and if Dal heard her, he said nothing. <br>
<br>
<center><b>{Section Two:  Dream Come True}</b></center><br>
<br>
There was a shadow among forest life today. Vaelynn moved around quickly and silently, slipping through brush and between trees like wind through fingers. <i>I can't believe I'm doing this. She doesn't exist.</i><br>
<br>
	If one were to ask Vaelynn just why she was doing this, she would answer with a shrug. Dal hadn't brought the subject of the Druid up again, but she knew he was thinking about it, every time he glanced toward her. Every time he spoke. She could almost sense the question behind his eyes, and knew just how patient her brother could be. So, this morning, she packed herself some food and water and just took off. The search for the Druid might take days, but she didn't need to take anything else.<br>
<br>
	That was the entire day ago. Now it was night, and she was tired. She had finally reached the limit of her knowledge; she didn't know where she was. Instead of running around blind, she chose to follow the road, without showing herself. <i>If the Druid's anywhere, she's got to be in the Deep Forest, where no one goes. Once I find that one trail, the one less used, that branches from this one...that's where I'll be headed.</i><br>
<br>
It took her another hour to find a likely camping spot, far enough from the road she didn't have to worry about uninvited guests and close enough she wouldn't lose the trail. She wolfed down her small dinner of biscuits and smoked meat of whatever animal Dal had successfuly hunted. Tonight was the reason she brought it; she could it eat now, but if she had brought more, it would have slowed her down. The jerky in her waist-pouch was enough for her to live on. She had done it before.<br>
<br>
	As she hadn't started a fire, Vaelynn made herself a cozy little bed of leaves and pines beneath a tree and within the circle of a bush, falling asleep almost immediately.<br>
<br>
<center>***</center><br>
<br>
The attack came in the dead of night. No one had heard them coming, and most surely no one saw them coming now. Everyone was asleep in their beds, except for one.<br>
<br>
	Dalmer sat before the fire in his home, watching the flames. He thought only of his sister, young and untried in the forest, but there was no worry in his mind. He knew the animals would flock to her in times of danger, the same way he knew what she would be in the future. She wouldn't have the surroundings of a simple village, but the surroundings of nature and magic. She had the abilities of a ranger lying dormant in her. The only problem was, she didn't have a teacher.<br>
<br>
<i>	I didn't teach her the bow, I just showed her how to use it. Despite the horrible arrows I found lying around, and used just to show her how archery was done, she still managed to get pretty close to the target. She has a natural eye and somehow she knows the balance needed. I'm good enough that I can kill something, but that's it. She has strength, too. She can lift as much as me, maybe more, thought it doesn't show. She's thin, but not too thin, like Mother. She looks like mother, but she is Father.</i><br>
<br>
	Something intruded on his thoughts. It was just a feeling, but...<br>
<br>
<center>***</center><br>
<br>
<i>She was walking along the ruins of what was once Resse. Everything was burned to the ground. Fear and anger burned in her stomach, and guilt weighed heavily on her mind. She brought the bodies to the center of the charred ashes, tears stinging her eyes but never falling. Everything was done by rote. She felt so dead inside, as she held corpses of her dearest friends, of her foster family, and her brother. Everyone was dead, down to little Artema, only a week old.<br>
<br>
	She arranged them in a circle, then brought charred wood still burning and tossed it onto the bodies. Soon flame engulfed clothing and skin and hair. Vaelynn knelt and picked up the few weapons somewhat saved from the wreck. They hadn't been taken, for whatever reason. She picked up her brother's bow and sword, sheathing one and simply carrying the other.<br>
<br>
	She began the trek, through the forest and onto the main road. Traveling, who knows where.<br>
<br>
	Then...the bandits.</i><br>
<br>
<center>***</center><br>
<br>
"Gods!" Vaelynn bolted upright, the fear, the anger, the grief still lingering inside her. She shivered, but not in cold. "Gods." It was different. It was so different. She took great gulps of cool, crisp air, standing and stumbling out from her little shelter. A glance up at the sky; it was dawn. She picked up her pack and brushed angry tears from her eyes.<br>
<br>
	"Why do you have to torture me this way?" she whispered, tense and shaking. "Fear and anger and grief, so much of each to eat me up inside."<br>
<br>
	"It isn't torture, but a vision of what can be, will be, and has been."<br>
<br>
	Vaelynn turned sharply, her head snapping around, her eyes searching for the source of that voice. Calm and smooth, beautiful, but devoid of emotion. "Where are you?" she asked, shaking. Had she displeased the gods? Were they sending someone down, for justice to whatever wrong she had done toward them?<br>
<br>
<center><b>{Section Three: Pain In Truth}</b></center><br>
<br>
She didn't know how it happened, but Vaelynn was sitting as calm as could be inside the Druid's tiny cabin. She was waiting for the explanations, not just of the dreams, but of...everything.<br>
<br>
	"Resse is no more."<br>
<br>
	The Druid spoke abruptly, and Vaelynn closed her eyes. She had suspected something of the sort, but she didn't believe her dreams were truly reality. The guilt burned like acid in her stomach, as she nodded slowly. "I think I knew," she said quietly, opening her eyes and staring at the older woman. She didn't know it, but the Druid approved of her. She didn't break down and weep, or go into shock. She simply absorbed it and acknowledged it. The tears, the pain, she wouldn't let it get in her way right now. She would let loose later, when she could afford to. She had the power of will.<br>
<br>
	"The different variations of your dream didn't seem to have any difference in the dream itself. But here is what they meant." The Druid turned, stared into the fire. Figures seemed to shimmer within. "If you were in the forest, you were hunting for me, for answers. I would give you what I could. A bow, a sword, arrows, and directions. Plus some spells to keep you safe for a while. That would allow you to survive the bandits that would waylay you on the way to Kelethin, where I would send you. If you had been in the winecellar, Dal wouldn't have told you about me and you would have died on the road. The reason you would be on the road...because you wanted to run away from the truth, you didn't want to face it. You were scared and didn't want to admit it.<br>
<br>
	"I know this because I had dreams of this coming. I can interpret dreams, and I've been keeping an eye on you for a long time, Vaelynn." The girl gave a little start, shocked at the use of her name. The Druid smiled slightly, humorlessly. "You have the same power I have, but with more strength of body. You can use druid magic, but you will never have the strength of one. You have the abilities of a warrior; they come to you naturally. You would be a ranger, like your father was. You will be stronger in magic. Your mother was a druid, but no one ever knew."<br>
<br>
	Vaelynn stared at the Druid, her mouth dry, her thoughts racing to keep up with reality. "Mother was a druid?" she asked slowly. She had never known, and she didn't think Dal did--had--either. Her hands clenched at the thought of her brother, and pain pierced through her. Pain immediately blocked, postponed for the moment.<br>
<br>
	"Yes." The Druid was silent, steepling her hands together and frowning into the fire. "She was my student, a bright one. Beautiful and kind, and she had the animals' love. She has given those gifts to you. Dianetta was the daughter I never had. I raised her, I taught her, I loved her. When your Father came to ask for her hand, I gave him permission. When Dalmer was born, I rejoiced. When you were born, I feared. I could sense the pain you would go through in life. I could sense the darkness you would have to fight. So, I kept an eye on you. I helped you when you needed help. I rarely appear to anyone. I haven't openly helped anyone in years, many, many years. I must stay quiet, I had to stay quiet, so that I would be here for you now. <br>
<br>
	"I must send you to Kelethin, where you will find a good friend of mine. He is a ranger, he will show you what you need to learn. You must learn, Vaelynn. But for now, you must heal." She stood gracefully, watching her charge with cool green eyes. "Any questions, little one?"<br>
<br>
	"Yes." Vaelynn stared at the woman who, if she thought about it, was kind of her grandmother. "What's your name?"<br>
<br>
<center>***</center><br>
<br>
Vaelynn curled up in the large bed the Druid--no, Aleriana--had brought to the loft. She stared out, at the night sky, watching the silvered rays of the moon. Tears wet her cheeks, dropped onto her pillow. Pain throbbed in her. Was it possible to feel such pain, pain to rip your heart from your chest?<br>
<br>
	She wished Dalmer were here with her. She wished she had brought Dal with her. There was so many things she wished now, so many things she wanted to say to him, so many secrets she wanted to tell him. She felt guilt for not being able to say goodbye, not having said goodbye, before she had left. She hadn't known she would never see him again, but was that any excuse? She wept silently, thinking back to all the fun times she had. It wasn't just Dalmer, it ws everyone she missed. Everyone she wanted to say at least something to, to admit to something because it involved them. She wanted to tell them she loved them one more time. to tell them good-bye. But she couldn't, because they were dead. Because orcs had once more stolen all those she loved and cared for from her. Orcs had destroyed her life again. Why was it she had to go through this? Why was it that there was always pain, a constant pain throbbing within her? Why did her heart always have to bleed dry?<br>
<br>
	Nothing was fair anymore. She couldn't ever see her loved ones again. She couldn't ever laugh with them, joke around, play and have serious talks. She couldn't ever share secrets with her best friend. She could never be a child again. She very much doubted the child in her was still there. Yes, maybe she could have her fun times, but then again, maybe she couldn't. Maybe she could find close friends again, and maybe even love again...but then again, maybe not.<br>
<br>
