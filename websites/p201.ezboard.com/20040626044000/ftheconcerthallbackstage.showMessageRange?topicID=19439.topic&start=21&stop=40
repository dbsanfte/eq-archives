<br>
Kunark and the old world were aimed at single groups for the most part, and it took a lot more content to keep the same number of people occupied.  (Remember when Chardok, Seb and HS were scary?)  They realized at that point (SoV) they could tie more people up longer, on less content reducing development expenses.  SoL was a little worse, with timesinks to get very far, though both it and SoV did have some decent &quot;level 60 non-hardcore player&quot; content.<br>
<br>
Then comes PoP, unless you were willing to devote large quantities of time, you weren't going anywhere.  The game was pretty much over.  They fixed that somewhat when they opened up the lower tier zones, throwing a bone to the non-raiders that were leaving in droves.<br>
<br>
LoY always has people in it, leveling, farming etc.., regardless of what people say.  Hates Fury is probably only unused zone.<br>
<br>
LDoN was neat, but limited and got boring quickly.  I'd guess it was fast and cheap to develop.<br>
<br>
GoD again focused on the top 10-15%, who don't really pay the bills at SoE.  It's very easy to get levels\AAs, but the gear to survive\progress essentially requires you to be in a raiding guild.  Something that 80% don't have time to do.  If you were to cheapen it (like PoP) people will just burn through it (in their bazaar gear) and be bored again.<br>
<br>
How to fix it without pissing even more people off?  Damned if I know.<br>
<br>
Allowing the easy, primarily outdoor leveling pipeline that emerged three(?) years ago to continue was the begining of the end I guess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kirico>Kirico</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#330000>(6/1/04 9:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: sigh</span><hr size=1> Interesting.  On Prexus the top guilds did their best to block each other (and everyone else) from progressing.  This allowed them to keep and farm the high end stuff to their heart's content.<br>
<br>
This even trickled down to the second wave of guilds getting into the elementals- they in turn did their best to block the third wave.<br>
<br>
Now everyone is pretty amendable.  There are pickup raids that people can go to and people generally play nice (in PoP).  I have no idea how it goes in GoD.<br>
<br>
These observations are from talking to friends in 'uber' guilds and one time I was invited to a RZ raid that was happening specifically to block a rival guild from doing it.<br>

<br>
I still like EQ very much and look forward to EQ2, but I do wish they would continue to add more single group content.  I LOVED ldon.  I loved veksar (though it was a bit too easy).  I liked the sewer trials in GoD, except for travel to/from and some glitches.  I have no complaints for adding lots and lots of raid content, but I do wish they would continue to add lots and lots of single group content as well.  <br>
<br>
The 2 biggest mistakes ever in EQ are, in order: <br>
1) Complete Heal<br>
2) 70ish person raids.<br>

<br>
And for the comment from Genado, if this was attitude I prefered when he was giving a decent enough reason for his nerf demand (ok, after some pressure to get him to explain why he considered it necessary).<br>
<br>
I don't ask for ANYTHING on a plate but if I can kill it with friends and it is up I would like to be allowed to do so.<br>
Having a raid to kill Gorenaire twice gathered up to see 3 or 4 of the best equiped people on the server walk up to it and butcher it in about 1 minute kinda bites.<br>
And no, it was not about not being ready, the raid was buffed, the pull was started and while the puller went up it died.<br>
I am sure they could have noticed the little detail of 36+ people lvl 55 to 60 in a zone that normally has a whopping dozen people lvl 40 to 50 on Xegony.<br>
Sofar I have done all of my epic drops with friends or pick-up raids or even soloed and nothing bought.<br>
I don't mind the extra effort, actually I prefer it that way but it can get frustrating to see everything you can take on get dropped in a minute or so while leaving you with some regular xp mobs or LDoN farming as options to gear up on your own effort.<br>
<br>
It was common for some people, on purpose or not, to go and slaughter all that stands for vendor loot on more then one server leaving the just below crowd standing around.<br>
Racing a raid versus half a group or a group is nigh-on impossible to win unless you have some very well drilled raiders which you don't normally get in family guilds because it just is easier to co-ordinate 3 or 4 people then to do the same with over 30 people.<br>
<br>
In this case I think that was not attitude but a rather cutting remark which makes me feel insulted by implying I ask for the easy way out since I am one of those rather casual players (a week I play about 5 or 6 hours spread over 2 days and I raid maybe once a month, more casual then that, well, shall we say it is not that easy to find <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
I think Genado should have considered what he wrote there since it would not be received too well by a fair few people.<br>
He may say the truth even when we don't like it but that was not it, a possibility perhaps but most definately not a request from the majority of casuals.<br>

<br>
When I mean rotations I mean take a mob like king tormax.  If no one can kill him, anyone can try.<br>
<br>
Once someone kills king tormax they have a rotation with themselves. At anytime another guild that has not killed king tormax wants to try it, they have free run at him any time they wish.<br>
<br>
Once two or more guilds are on the kill list, they take turns with day long windows on spawn. Tormax spawns, guild up for him has 24 hours to kill, hoildays like thanksgiving effectively ignored in that time period(normally window goes to 48 hours).<br>
<br>
So what's the end result to all of this? Anyone that wants to kill King tormax needs to be up on rotation for it or have never killed him. Meaning if someone is from a ele+ guild, they are not killing tormax because their guild autopasses and voids their attempt.<br>
<br>
The one exception to all this is that if it is a patch night, any major mobs still up go free for all so the odd 5 man group can come and hit KT... IF he's up. King tormax is normally not available for freeforall.<br>
<br>
The same would apply to a pick up raids (they would become a 'guild' in function) I guess but my sever was so gutted on the server split, there's simply not enough unguilded people to support pick up raids.<br>
<br>
So basicly for the last 3 years, there has been no jumping in line (well the guilds that tried it earned mass enimies who would trample all over their rotation days) and all mobs from gore on up are on rotation so long as some guild expresses interest. The first real mob that was abandoned by guilds was trakanon I think as I've seen him up more than a few times and helped take him down for a possible undead bard pop.  IT did take years for that guy to be abondoned btw.<br>
<br>
So really, it's so structured on my server, someone people are driven mad lol.<br>
<br>

I don't waste my time when some is lying to themselves, or to others.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to try to inject a little reality into what has been said though.  This is based on my own history playing on Povar since Nov. 1999.  <br>
<br>
To start off with, before Kunark, the level cap was 50.  There is no denying that.  The problem is that both articles are looking through rose colored glasses and saying things that are untrue.  <br>
<br>
The fact is that the game is one that demands a time commitment, even as a casual player.  I played casually.  <br>
<br>
When I would log in with my RL friend after she got me into the game.  We'd play for hours, though I would play a bit extra because she started before I did and I wanted to catch up.  We'd save up our coppers and sold every bit we could scavenge from the corpses, and each time one of us leveled, we'd meet on the ground near the orc lift and work our  way through a stack of mead and it was a blast.  <br>
<br>
Then I got to level 12, and we both got into a guild.  <br>
<br>
Even in those days, if you wanted &quot;the good stuff&quot;, you had to camp it.  For hours or days on end.  People complained back then about it too, but now they seem to have forgotten the permanent camps in places like lguk for the DE mask or the AC (croc or cyclops) and stuff like that.  There was a time sink even then, and no one would accept the idea that you should be able to progress through dungeons, and just happen to find creatures up and kill them and maybe get the loot you wanted.  No, you had to camp it.  <br>
<br>
If you wanted the &quot;uber&quot; stuff, like dragon kills or going to hate or fear, you needed to be in a guild in order to do it.  Those spots were not available to the casual player.  The big guilds always hit those spots.  Raiding was in the game when the dragons were in.  Welcome to &quot;uber&quot; content, stuff that needed organized guilds.   <br>
<br>
The guild I was in (lore keepers) had a lot of high level peeps, but it split and formed an uber guild with some other folks, a guild that had level requirements to get in, and one that was specifically raid oriented. (nightmare's asylum)  I liked the guild I was in, so I stayed with it.  Peeps that I was friends with that had moved on would talk to me and tell me about stuff that dropped.  But if I wanted to get that stuff, I had to leave the guild I was in and join them (as well as spending the time to level).  I was more into having fun. <br>
<br>
When Kunark came out, I was in my low 30's, and grouping in cazic and just enjoying the game. <br>
<br>
Kunark it was more of the same.  A whole bunch of stuff for regular players, and some content that was raid only, like the dragons and stuff.  the epics were added later, and those were mostly ubers only too.  The casual players were gaining levels and joining the big guilds, or staying with their old guilds and hitting the old world content that was now available to them because of their new power (and the fact that the big guilds had moved on).  The time sink remained in the game because you still had to sit and camp stuff for hours on end, and a new very specific time sink got added with the key to VP.  You had a time sink AND a big guild raid only target (trakanon) required to get into this one zone.   Very few peeps got there.  <br>
<br>
I was still in my 30's when the next expansion came out.  I didn't want to just focus on grinding out levels (boring!), I was still having fun, doing quests and starting alts and seeing what they could do etc.  I was still having a blast with the game.  <br>
<br>
Next came Velious, once again, you had time sinks (mass slaughter for faction), more restricted content (sleepers tomb) and stuff that only the ubers could hit, while the casual players could now hit the content from kunark when they got the upgrades from the new content.   They also introduced progressive quests, which were pretty spiffy in and of themselves, but required a large time commitment and the end rewards needed the uber guilds to do.  <br>
<br>
When velious came out, I got the expansion the first day, I took the boat over, and ran around in the snow fields and looked at the bunnies and marveled at the other cool graphics.  Then I left and didn't come back for months.  <br>
<br>
By that time, friends had all leveled past me, and I decided it was time to level.   I did that to the exclusion of all else, and the camps in the old worlds were now open, so I could level fast without all the competition.  After kiting for a couple of weeks, I'd gained levels, and I went to my first dragon raid the day I hit 46.  It was a pickup raid and I won Selo's drums and was so very psyched.  <br>
<br>
So, as a casual player, I was now hitting older content with other casual players, and it was all good as far as I was concerned.  I wanted the cool gear, but I wasn't in a big guild, so I wasn't going to get it.  I was getting other stuff that I hadn't had the opportunity to get because I wasn't in an uber guild.  My original guild had died, and I had joined a family type guild. <br>
<br>
Then came Luclin.  Again, more of the same, a lot of content for the casual player, with new stuff that required keys to get into.  This meant that the uber guilds still had something to  do, and there were still time sinks, and those of us that were casual now had more content (velious) that we could hit because of our power gains in luclin (new spells etc.).  <br>
<br>
I did hit 60 before the next expansion, but again, that's because I finally focused on leveling to the exclusion of all else.  It was grinding exp day in and day out for long periods of time.  It required a time commitment.  <br>
<br>
Then came PoP, which a lot of peeps referred to as the end when things fell apart.  I couldn't disagree more.  If you wanted access to the new content, then you had to be geared decently with the old content (epics or better, velious armors etc).  The casual/family guilds could get past the trials to get into PoV and PoS, it just took a lot of time (and some luck), LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME UP TIL THEN!  <br>
<br>
You also had the option to do quests to get you into some of the other zones, and those quests took time, but were very doable by a single group. <br>
<br>
But Verant listened to the complaints and opened up the lower tiers of the expansion based on level.  And that's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not good enough because the casual players don't have access to the higher raid content without doing the lower raids.   <br>
<br>
They complain that they should have the same opportunity to do/see the content as the ubers do because they pay the same amount of money.  They do this without taking the time to think that they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>DO</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have the same opportunity to do/see content as the ubers, but they are not able (for whatever reason) to devote the time to do this<br>
<br>
I finally decided that I wanted to see some of the spots I hadn't seen before, and I joined a raiding guild.  I'm not quite elemental flagged (need RZ), but I'm almost time flagged, and I have been piggy-backed into the elemental planes several times and I think that's cool.  <br>
<br>
There's also a loose organization of small guilds and unguilded peeps that are doing flag raids to get others into the higher planes, and that's great.  <br>
<br>
I've been to a bunch of these raids, and they do fail a lot of the time because the game does require a time commitment (whether you are willing to beleive it or not) and it does require that you pay attention and listen to those that are more experienced.  If you don't, you wipe out and peeps don't get the flags.  And a  lot of the times when things are starting to go bad (or have gone bad and the organizers want to make another run now that peeps know better), a lot of the casual players start to bail out because they don't have another hour or two to try again for whatever reason.  And then they complain that they can't get into the planes. <br>
<br>
I don't know how much of this makes sense, but I hope I made some kind of point. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=456989" target="top">Muse Idril Galelin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,   <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=860858" target="top">Exarch Mirai Tekk'sint</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=idrilgalelin>Idril Galelin</A> at: 6/2/04 2:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frostdragonsinger@theconcerthall>FrostDragonsinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#330000>(6/2/04 1:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> agreed</span><hr size=1> Very good Idril, You hit it well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   GO POVAR<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

most these topics are family or casual players vs powergamers or raiders.    By Raiders I mean at least 15 to 40hours a week raiding and most are 30 to 72 people per raid.    By power gamer I mean would a cathater would be a useful tool and playing means more then intercourse or work.    A family player puts player interaction and RL before rewards.    Casuals can very but seem to be once a week raiders once a week powergamers and 5 days of walking the dog types.<br>
<br>
The heat of the topic is that Sony is calling the top 50 guild leaders to a summit that will set the tone for the at least next year.    Fan Faires are to have a good time but are very guarded in interaction.   a Summit is a closed door and depends on a open repore.  <br>
<br>
Who are these Guildleaders and what type of people do they stand for?   Guilds that run 72 member raids, have raid points,   and strongly recommend raid attendance?  How much of the guild has a say in what goes on?   how much of the guilds business is run in officer meetings only.<br>
<br>
Woody going to the summit opens it up a little not enough.    <br>
<br>
Hmm I think I am going to start a new topic on issues for Summit.  <br>

&quot;I didn't even bother reading through both of the articles. I don't waste my time when some is lying to themselves, or to others.&quot;<br>
<br>
... and yet you made the longest reply.<br>
<br>
You spend a lot of ink clouding the issues reliving your gaming life.<br>
I'm a pre-kunark player too (I just won't bore everyone with my history)<br>
<br>
The history of the game on the other hand I will cover:<br>
For each expansion SoE made a few (1 or 2) zones that were much harder to get to than the rest of the expansion.  Pre-Kunark = Hate,fear &amp; sky.  Kunark = VP.  Velious= ST and PoMischief.  Luclin = Vex Thal.<br>
These zones were meant to keep the hardcore players busy (paying) until the next expansion.  When the next expansion came out, SoE put ordinary gear in it that surpassed the hardest old zone and so those were abandoned (i.e. no one hunts in VP for gear, there's better in the bazaar).  This was a major marketing ploy to drive the sales of the new expansion.<br>
<br>
You seem to be under the misguided belief that once a new expansion comes out the &quot;Ubers&quot; will hunt exclusivly there.  This is not what actually happens though.  The game has time sinks (respawn timers mostly)  and while the &quot;Ubers&quot; are waiting on those respawn timers they go slumming.  So all that old content, that you think you'll have to yourself becomes the playground for single groups of ubers... and you are still unable to try that content.  It only takes 1 guild of players on a server, who don't give a damn about honoring camp checks (which Sony doesn't recognize anyway), to  ruin/delay a lot of fun for everyone else.<br>
<br>
Planes of Power only worsened the situation.  <br>
I can't disagree with you more about how badly that expansion destroyed the social fabric of every server.  <br>
<br>
In previous expansion only 1 (or 2) zones were UNavailable to the general user base.  In PoP the general user base only got 4 new zones to hunt in.  Yes you could complete quests to get in to 4 more (CoD, Valor &amp;  Storms which lead to BoT) but THAT was all.  Furthermore those alternate methods of entry DID NOT count towards progress towards EP/Time.  This expansion FORCED guilds to grow big in order to do the content.  That coupled with the slow respawn rates caused these big guild to back into older content and consume it (even faster) as well.<br>
<br>
That comercial &quot;its time to slay the dragon&quot; always made me laugh.  Every player knew darn well that by the time that guild got home, booted up and logged into the game some other guild was already wiping dragon blood off their weapons.<br>
<br>
You're heroic &quot;I had to make a choice&quot; suck-it-up-and-join-a-raiding-guild is just propaganda to support the status quo.  This problem of time sinks has been around for years.  Its the major cause of the strife, KSing, raid jumping, training and ninja looting that occurrs in this game.  <br>
<br>
Why would you condone it?<br>
If there was more content than people could consume before it respawned,  there wouldn't be fights and races.  People could relax and not lose sleep over a game.  If some people &quot;finish the game&quot;  great.  They can work on an alt or leave until the next expansion. <br>
<br>
Every time in the past that people have complained about this crap they have also eagerly run out and bought the next expansion.  Sony only thinks with their wallet and now they are scared because people aren't buying the new expansion.  Now is our opportunity to tell them what we have been asking for all along... and this time they might listen.  <br>
<br>
On a side note here.  <br>
Many casual players are afraid that this &quot;guild Summit&quot; will just promote more of what the big guilds want and not what is best for the game as a whole.  I tend to agree.  Most of those guild leaders will not think altruisticly about the direction of the game.<br>
<br>
The solution I'm asking for is a simple one.<br>
It doesn't involve a lot re-coding, or re-vamping of any zones.  <br>
No mob should re-spawn slower tha once in 8 hours.  That give people around the world (Time zone wise) a much more even shot at any mob.  <br>
<br>
If mudflation or twinking is the reason Sony doesn't do this then the solution is equally simple.  Set more items as no drop and put level restrictions on them.  Heck you could easily set a minimum level to loot an object.  A similar process is already in the game (the loot tables on Firiona Vie).  After all this game is supposed to be everQUEST, not everFARM. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

i started as a casual gamer but i met many new friends in norrath, some even died in RL . the friends i played with every night after work for a couple hours became my family so we started a guild back in 99 with the dream that we would all advance thru this new world we had fallen upon and at even our prime we never had more than 20 people online at the same time but we were GREAT friends as close to being a maternal family as online gaming could allow and always had a good time. <br>
<br>
once PoP came out we could no longer advance in the game other than to grind XP or if we left our friends to join a raiding guild. suddenly my family was gone and due to the amount of raiding time required by large guilds my closest friends who left to go see the game they pay'd for never had time to do what made us friends in the first place. <br>
<br>
an injury left me unable to walk giving me untold hours of &quot; EQ time &quot; so, after a few months of seeing my family change from close friends to accaintances that i got to know for only a month or 2 before they knew that they would also need to join a large raiding guild to advance i realized that our dream of playing together as a small guild was over. i needed to go from the casual gamer with alot of free time to the raiding player i am today.<br>
<br>
<br>
im in a great guild i have made lots of friends. i see all the high end content now as we are a time enabled guild. but i still yearn for the days when the hair on the back of my neck stood up on each turn of the corner in guk.<br>
<br>
i wish the casual gamer would have access to every zone because they put every AVAILABE hour they can into EQ just like the power gamers but ....... that WILL NEVER happen because SoE knows the main thing that keeps the casual(the real people who foot the bill) gamer interested besides friends they play with is wanting to see the content they cant get to. <p>Elfise Pressleaf<br>

<br>
Gotta disagree with the time thing that forms the core of your arguement.<br>
<br>
-<br>
<br>
I would posit that the design of PoP etc isn't poor because of the 'casual/uber' relationship that keeps getting described i.e. time spent online. It's because of the number requirement for raids, the inevitable decrease in server populations and the fact that there is no alternate road for advancement to even 'see' end-game PoP content besides the <i>very limited</i> content of LDoN.<br>
<br>
-<br>
<br>
It's not [i]just[/i] about time.<br>
<br>
I play 20-40 hours a week (a catheter might be a good idea). 65, with well over 200aa, a mix of Velious NODROP and Luclin droppable gear.<br>
<br>
I can't do upper tier PoP because there aren't enough people playing on my server at the times I'm on (evenings gmt).<br>
<br>
My guild has killed AD, TT and other tier 1 PoP raid content with roughly 25 to 30 velious geared toons (approx 1/4 of which were boxed). Often we're down to 1 healer standing, a chanter desperately rune tanking and all the burn classes throwing their burst dps in by the time we're at the last 5pct of mob health, but we can still do it.<br>
<br>
However, we're finding that we now can't progress in PoP due to needing more people to raid.<br>
<br>
PoP's poor game design: PoP will never 'open up' to me, regardless of the amount of time that I spend playing, unless I start getting up at 3 in the morning to go and raid with US guilds, or every other member of my guild starts triple boxing at raids.<br>
<br>
Even with OoW and level 70, I somehow don't think that's going to reduce the requirements for PoP raids by half.<br>
<br>
The basic flaw in PoP is simple. It's an extrapolation of the phenomena Idril talks about.<br>
<br>
No access to zones without doing raids.<br>
<br>
The first raid content was great. You can zone into Sol.B but can't kill Naggy without a raid. You can kill drakes in ToV, but Doze might be out of reach. 1000 shissar die by my hand, but I'll never see the emp.<br>
<br>
The same isn't true of PoP. I'd be happy being able to zone into PoAir, even if I don't stand a chance in hell of ever being able to kill Xegony. As it stands I'll never even see a trash mob from PoAir, never get a chance to make the decent planar tradeskill armours, etc. etc. Not even just zone-in to enjoy the view.<br>
<br>
That's why people _are_ justified to complain about spending money and getting little or nothing in return. Because with PoP, they are denied the basic content, the trash mobs, the scenery. And the percentage of people bottlenecked at that point will just increase as time goes on, whilst the actual number of those people decreases.<br>
<br>
What alternative <i>to end game PoP raiding*</i> is there <i>if you want to prep up for GoD*</i>? <font size=2>*edit</font><br>
<br>
Well, there's LDoN. Whilst I'm happy to put in a lot of time, 40+ hours per piece of core armour is just too much. That's excluding setup times, failures, etc. Not to mention the augs, which take yet another massive chunk of time to 'earn'. Besides which, LDoN is dull as hell. If they doubled the point rewards it'd be reasonable, but as is, well... ZZZZzzzzzzz. LDoN is grind. Grind is not fun.<br>
<br>
Besides which, no matter how much LDoN I do, it will never get me into PoAir, even to kill trash mobs. With 25ish players, even in full LDoN kit, I imagine it'd be quite a struggle, if not impossible to see much of the higher end PoP stuff.<br>
<br>
GoD events and LDoN raids would be fine, save that they pretty much assume that your character has top-end Luclin/PoP equipment. The mobs are balanced as such. But hang on... you can't get top end Luclin/PoP equipment without the large raids... so... uh... 6 months of farming LDoNs day in, day out? No thanks.<br>
<br>
For now I may be the exception to the rule, but once the populations drop on your servers I think you'll start to notice the same thing across the board.<br>

[font size=2](yes, I'm on SZ and the problems are exacerbated by training etc. But the main problem is still lack of people. Especially since our server pop is split 3 ways to start with. Oh and hell, we must be the worst server of all time for 'cockblocking' guild advancement. I'd probably transfer to another server... but you can't transfer off SZ save to $tormHammer.

<br>
Unfortunately, all I can do is empathize about not being able to hit the content now due to lack of peeps. <br>
<br>
The loose alignment of guilds/unguilded are slowly taking care of the problem, and I can see peeps making it to the elementals and time when level 70 comes around because they are that much more powerful, and you will be able to do it with a smaller crew and less organization. <br>
<br>
And you've neatly proved my point about casual players and time commitment.   You don't want to spend the time getting the equipment, but you want the equipment (and access) anyway.  The raiding guilds that get the top stuff spend huge amounts of time to kill one critter that a couple things. Like killing rathe last night, over 5 hours, 70+ peeps 3 items.  Do you think it's fun for th2e ubers to have to farm events like that again and again?<br>
<br>
Cevinzol: I'm sorry if I implied that the ubers hunted only in new spots.  I meant to say that the ubers are less likely to be in the old spots, and the casual peeps have the opportunity to do the things that only the ubers did before.  <br>
<br>
But again, I have to disagree about PoP.  I'll get long winded again, so please bear with me.   <br>
<br>
I think it was innovative, and not that restrictive at all, it just required peeps to only get to places when they were ready/powerful enough to get there.   <br>
<br>
Like the level requirements for the old world planes, or the restricted areas in luclin (emp key etc).   Going someplace and not being big enough (level or equipment wise), and just getting killed again and again is no fun.  It's pretty pointless as a matter of fact.  <br>
<br>
PoK &amp; tranquility, freely available connection zones that made travel easier and everything in PoP was conencted off Tranquility, no other expansion had that.  I lament the loss to druids and wizzies porting (that was a good piece of income for them), but I like tranquility.<br>
  <br>
PoNightmare - it's a good adventuring zone with a lot of different critters and challenge.  Some family/casual guild killable bosses.  There's a quest here to get to the zone with the boss, it's doable by 18 peeps at a time.  Just like the emporer (I'm guessing here) you could get peeps access and go look at the boss, but you couldn't kill without a raid, that's fine, it's like previous zones.   There's also a quest here that gives access to Plane of Torment.  But you seem to have neglected that.    <br>
<br>
Plane of Innovation: good adventuring, not too much in the way of critter diversity, but there's a chance to kill a dragon, which requires a raid.  Good stuff.  And killing the dragon gets you into the boss.  Again, similar to what you had before.   The difference being that killing the boss got you access to another plane. <br>
<br>
Plane of Justice: good adventuring zone, wide array of critters, and a single group trial that gave you access to more zones.  Pretty cool.  The trial was hard, but doable by even casual players.  There's several trials, and beating them all gets you to the boss.  Which is still similar to other stuff. <br>
<br>
Plane of Disease - A good adventuring zone with named and a castle with a boss.  Very cool.  Killing the boss OR doing a single group quest got you to another zone.  <br>
<br>
So, if you passed the trial, you could get to two zones. <br>
Plane of Valor - A very nice adventuring zone, with a dragon in it.  The dragon required an easy (though time consuming) key to get to.  Kill the dragon and you get to another plane.  Do a single group (or soloable) quest, and get to another plane. <br>
<br>
Plane of Storms - A good split of environments, but roughly the same critters.  The named critters that were required to get to another plane were capable of being killed by family guilds.  And, get this, it had a single groupable key quest to an entirely different plane.  <br>
<br>
Wow, talk about progression.  I had a sense of accomplishment every time I finished one of the quests or got a flag.   <br>
<br>
In CoD you can still do the Carprin thing to get access to Bert as long as you can get into the plane.  In HoH you can still do the trials to get into HoHb.  In Tactics you can still raid the bosses.  <br>
<br>
So, before I joined an uber guild and supported the status quo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , with the help of friends or my guild, I had access to every plane except Sol ro, elementals and time.  That's pretty good.  <br>
<br>
Your complaints seem to center around the fact that you can get access to the places, but can't see the bosses, OR you can't get into a place, but could you get into VT, VP, ST?  No you couldn't.  I've never been to those places either, and I probably never will.  Unless some peeps decide to &quot;go slumming&quot;.  I haven't even been to NToV.  However, there was definitely access to more than just the 4 + 4 for the casual/family guild player.  <br>
<br>
In PoP the difference is that about 1/3 of the zones aren't available, but it was billed as a very high end expansion, and the &quot;high end&quot; has always meant raiding, and raiding has always meant guilds.  <br>
<br>
To make up for this, they released LoY, which has raid events that no one bothered with.  <br>
<br>
They release LDoN, which was designed for the casual player.  And included 36 person raids.  Which no one does because they required peeps with the elemental gear, OR with the top end purchased gear from that expansion.  Too much time requirement. <br>
<br>
The reason I condone the &quot;status quo&quot; is because it is good marketing on the part of Verant.  <br>
<br>
If you had all your equipment wishes fulfilled in an easy fashion, how long would you play the game?  It's good marketing to keep things rare-ish as they do, it keeps peeps interested.  There wouldn't be any sense of accomplishment if a guild could just farm the named and get everything every member wanted in a week or two.  The perceived value of the items gained from the long spawn critters is the rarety.  <br>
<br>
Think of the halfling mask.  That is such an annoying camp, and yet peeps spend days and weeks camping for it.  Why?  It's stupid rare.  If every 8 hours the overseer was up and just dropped the mask, where's the value?  <br>
<br>
Just form a queue, everyone gets one, next please. <br>
<br>
I complain about it right along with everyone else, but I went and spent several days getting my faction up to ally, then I spent 40 or so hours camping the mask.  When I got it, I was happy and I have the added bonus of being a halfling whenever I want.<br>
<br>
It's a grass is greener thing (or sour grapes).  Even if you got everything, if someone else was perceived to be having more fun, then you want what they have.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=456989" target="top">Muse Idril Galelin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,   <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=860858" target="top">Exarch Mirai Tekk'sint</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vainne>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 860<br> <font color=#330000>(6/3/04 10:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thought this was an interesting read...</span><hr size=1> Idril I liked your discussion up to the end when it got wonky.<br>
<br>
One thing I don't think you've taken into account is, there are more people bottlenecked at the end game (or close to it) than ever before. <br>
<br>
My server has 7 guilds (or 8?) in the elemental planes. We have 6 in Time, and another pretty close to it. I'm not, actually talking about competition for spawns, I'm talking about numbers of players that have gone through content and would like to see something new. It's not 100 people, its probably closer to 1000. It's about half the population of the server.<br>
<br>
In the Kunark era we pretty much had 2 guilds that killed Trak and Gore. In Velious, for over a year there was one or two guilds in Ntov. In Luclin, it took a year again for two guilds to have competition for emperor and VT...(the mind boggles at people spending more than 5 minutes in VT, thankfully I never had to.)<br>
<br>
Now there are...three guilds actively pursuing GoD content and another 3 who will be soon. Only one of those has made it past Uqua and Qvic to whatever zones lie behind (since that isnt me, and I can't spell those names, I won't even try.) But that content thus far has been a complete disaster.<br>
<br>
As it becomes &quot;retuned&quot; that half of our server population will be doing it, one assumes. The thing that HAS changed in EQ is, EQ is an old game, people have been playing it for a long long long time. People like me, who have probably always been somewhat &quot;casual&quot; and guilds like mine who have always been a bit laid back, have played long enough to advance to near the end of the road.<br>
<br>
Now suddenly you aren't just talking about content for the &quot;few&quot;--you're talking about raiding content for the majority.<br>
<br>
One mistake that I think SoE made long ago was to abandon dungeon experience zones in favor of outdoor hunting. Raiding content is at least sort of interesting (the first few times anyways). The alternative, sitting in the Plane of Fire on a zone wall, is not. Yes, yes, I know there are altneratives to that, but there the fault lies not with SoE but with the playerbase. One thing that never fails to amaze me is people's ability to grind experience joylessly--and that's not limited to casual or hardcore people--it's pretty much everyone.<br>
<br>
Ldon was a great alternative. We need more of it. We also need raid content for the majority now. <br>
<br>
In terms of the smaller guilds, and numbers--the level cap being raised and new content being added should address those concerns I'd expect. In terms of your numbers, as I have said before, if SoE does not get more people to start playing this game, your numbers, uber guild numbers, everyone's numbers will continue to decrease. In the end attrition will kill the game.<br>
<br>
So there are two issues:<br>
<br>
1.) Get more raiding content for the masses of ele/time guilds.<br>
2.) Get more people to start playing this silly game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=19439.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=19439.topic&start=41&stop=50>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showPrevMessage?topicID=19439.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showNextMessage?topicID=19439.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.emailToFriend?topicID=19439.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.threadControl?topicID=19439.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19439.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19439.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p201.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theconcerthallbackstage">Backstage<option value="theconcerthallcenterstage">Center Stage<option value="theconcerthallontour">On Tour<option value="theconcerthallthecriticschair">The Critics Chair<option value="theconcerthallstageleft">Stage Left<option value="theconcerthallfrm9">The Voting Booth<option value="theconcerthallfrm7">The Adventurer's Tavern<option value="theconcerthallthescriptingroom">The Scripting Room<option value="theconcerthallthegiftshoppe">The Gift Shoppe<option value="theconcerthallfrm8">The Hall of Fame<option value="theconcerthallfrm12">User Interfaces<option value="theconcerthallfrm11">Admin<option value="theconcerthallfrm13">Thread Trash Bin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall>The Concert Hall - Message Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage>Backstage</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.31o<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
