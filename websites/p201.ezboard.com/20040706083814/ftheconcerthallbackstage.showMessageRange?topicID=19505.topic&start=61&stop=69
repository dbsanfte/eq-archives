<br>
No, it hasn't. Maybe escape worked that way, I don't know.  When feigned you are not invis, but the spell hitting caused the mob that hit you to realize that you are not really dead. They would realize that at quite some distance, not only within aggro range because they can now see you. I don't believe distance effects FD at all.<br>
<br>
I have been nuked numerous times after fading and it never broke the fade. Other mobs in aggro range never reacted. I'm still invised. It has been that way ever since I got fade which was 2 levels and over 400AA ago.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=softlyscreaming>Softly Screaming</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#330000>(6/20/04 10:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19505.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fade</span><hr size=1> Its happened a few more times, so i'm sure of it now.

The solution is fade two or three times in a row if you can't duck behind a corner or something similar.<br>

If you lose aggro after using those skills while it is casting it will re aggro you if you are upright and aggroable..<br>

This means if  you fade while a mob is casting a nuke on you, when that nuke lands it re aggros...<br>

if you fd and lose aggro then stand up in time for the spell to land while you are standing... it aggros.<br>

If you fd and are fd'd mobs normally don;t aggro you, but if you fd and stay down when a spell lands on you.... it used to break it 100% and reaggro the caster.<br>

The stonewall aa allows a chance for a monk to remain fd'd and non aggroable when said spell lands.<br>

if a monk fd/stands and the spell lands while the monk is standing, stone wall doesn;t do anything, the mob reaggros like the monk used fade.<br>

<br>
That is not the way it always worked. The nuke does not cause the mob to re-aggro unless this is new with the last patch. I have faded and stood there and taken blasts from a few mobs and then watched them turn around and head home. A concrete example is the two rows of five mobs facing each other in VT, where a good half of them are casters. I dispel one and run down the hall, all ten will aggro. Fade. I've been nuked down two bubs worth standing there. But I'm down the hall and out of aggro range, so they don't notice me. When enough of them have returned to their place in line, I aggro pull by approaching the front mob. If this is changed, I'm dead. My back is already against the wall and the nukes don't all land at once, so I'd have to fade after every blast. <br>
<br>
This behavior is consistent with the definition of what fade does. It removes you from all hate lists and invises. Their nuke hitting does not cause aggro, therefore does not put you on a hate list. If you are too close to a see invis mob, then it may look that way. <br>
<br>
Feign works differently. After a certain level the mob has not really forgotten you. Since it hasn't really forgotten you, a nuke can break a feign. When I used to play a monk I remember watching a mob disappear over the horizon only to come running back after I stood up. It's no wonder monks were given the two minute, you're finally off the hate list reprieve. With a wandering mob they'd have no idea when it was safe to get up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thommytp>Thommy TP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#330000>(6/22/04 2:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19505.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fade</span><hr size=1> The DD in the first Ikkniz trial is now slowable (partially I believe), and warrior using defensive can't keep aggro for $hit.

We only got one instance, but the PA wasn't up. Also, there are now only 3 roamers in the halls (all Kyv mobs), and no roamers in the DDs room.

<br>
Somewhere along the line I noticed that it was different with Fade.. It stuck out in my mind as one of the many ways Fade was better than Feign.<br>
I'm also positive I would remember having to fade two/three times per caster mob due to being casted on. I don't remember that at all.<br>
<br>
The first camp I was in after the patch was the Deep, camping a wand. A mob got too close to his friends and they aggro'd on me. I finished killing my mob, walked away a bit and faded. I wasn't inside their aggro range, and none of them saw invis, and they all left me alone until a spell hit me. Once the spell landed the warrior mob rushed at me and the other two started to cast. I faded again and the same thing happened. The warrior mob went back home, but once the spells landed he rushed back at me. They killed me on the third time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Unless you have infinite mana, this is going to hurt you too. If i have four casters on me and I fade four more times (plus the original fade), then what? Mediate for tweny minutes? Pray?
