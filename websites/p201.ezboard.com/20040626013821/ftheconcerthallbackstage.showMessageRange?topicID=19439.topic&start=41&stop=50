<br>
Maybe more instancing of for PoP?<br>
<br>
I thought GoD was instances for things like the ikkinz trials and such, so you could have more than one guild doing that?<br>
<br>
Maybe something similar to that for PoP,  like a guild has to kill a pre-boss, then once they do that every spawn time (perhaps adjusted somehow), the guild has the option of an instanced zone with the boss up?  Put mini-bosses (not triggers for the main guy) in the regular zone with the regular spawn time. <br>
<br>
Like Fennin has a spawn time of three days (?), if you can clear to and kill &quot;avatar of fennin&quot;, then you can instance the zone every 3 days (or so) to have a shot at fennin? <br>
<br>
Or am I going wonky again? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=456989" target="top">Muse Idril Galelin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,   <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=860858" target="top">Exarch Mirai Tekk'sint</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slaektinblood>Slaek Tinblood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#330000>(6/3/04 11:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thought this was an interesting read...</span><hr size=1> Woah there, maybe my post isn't that well written, but I'd suggest a re-read after this one. I can only hope this helps clarify things and doesn't just muddle them even more.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You don't want to spend the time getting the equipment, but you want the equipment (and access) anyway<hr></blockquote><br>
<br>
Um, no. I don't want any equipment. I want to see new zones, farm trash mobs, do quests, tradeskills, etc. That was my point. And as I've said before, I'm happy to spend time doing particular things. I've farmed faction for the OT outpost, Kael/NToV, camped shards in green-con zones at level 65, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
With LDoN I get to spend a lot of time and get to see no.new.zones. Eventually, I might get a new item, but that really isn't the point.<br>
<br>
And I think you're mis-understanding my situation. We don't have 25 core raiders and 2 or 3 other guilds raiding at our times and tens of unguilded people floating about.<br>
<br>
If I zone into PoT when I get home from work I'll be lucky to see upwards of 10 people. PoK usually has less than 50.<br>
<br>
I'm part of the only guild on our server (on our team) that raids at european times.<br>
<br>
By the time I log off, those numbers have maybe doubled or tripled. But on our server we're split into 3 teams that can't even heal each other/group together let alone guild together. We've got a pretty unique perspective on low population problems. But it's only a matter of time before the problem is no longer unique to us. For the europeans that play, the effect is even more exaggerated.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I think it was innovative, and not that restrictive at all, it just required peeps to only get to places when they were ready/powerful enough to get there.<hr></blockquote><br>
<br>
My point is that no matter how long I spend on the game, I will never be 'powerful enough' to get to those places. Ever. <br>
<br>
<blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your complaints seem to center around the fact that you can get access to the places, but can't see the bosses,<hr></blockquote><br>
<br>
Actually, my <i>comments</i> center around the complete opposite. The best thing about some PoP areas are the alternative key quests (or xp only quests). To see a zone, but not kill the boss (and consequently get the 'uber' loot).<br>
<br>
<blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> OR you can't get into a place, but could you get into VT, VP, ST?<hr></blockquote><br>
<br>
And I don't particularly think that the VT/VP/ST designs are good either. But at least they didn't form 70% of the expansion content.<br>
<br>
-<br>
<br>
I'd be fine with the idea that, for instance, if I farmed 300 mephit talons in PoN then I could hand them in for an xp only key to SolRo or PoA etc. Or 300 hero parts, or whatever.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is that without 50ish people, there is little I can do to get access to either zone.<br>
<br>
I'm happy to put in time. I can't put in people. And because of that I'm never going to see a lot of the PoP content that I'd like to.<br>
<br>
As I stated in the other post my contention is that <i>time</i> is not the only issue.<br>
<br>
PoP content is simply scales poorly. Less people = less content. Not, less effort/time = less content. No zerg = no advancement. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slaektinblood>Slaek Tinblood</A> at: 6/3/04 11:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wyndaria>wyndaria</A></span><br> Posts: 251<br> <font color=#330000>(6/3/04 12:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Gotta agree with Slaek</span><hr size=1> I do agree with Slaek... and, as for Idril, sheesh. <br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't even bother reading through both of the articles. I don't waste my time when some is lying to themselves, or to others. <br>
...<br>
The problem is that both articles are looking through rose colored glasses and saying things that are untrue. &quot;<br>
<br>
I can't believe a rational, thinking person could write such total garbage.  You a) didn't read the articles, and then b) say they are untrue.   Anyway, I'm wasting my breath on you, which makes me the more the fool.<br>
<br>
As for the others, I agree with Slaek. <br>
<br>
I also play a fair bit, 3 hours a day, 6 days a week, for 4.5 years.  It's not uber level, but it's pretty darn close.  And, I see exactly the same issue.  PoP was a VERY good expansion with one exception.  70% of the content required HUGE raids of 50-70 people.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I can put in the time, but I can't put in the people&quot; - That's a great quote that sums it all up. <br>
<br>
LDoN was a great expansion for players like me.  The problem is that after 1 year of hunting in those zones, it's hard to get excited.  Yes, I have progressed, from normals to hards, and from hards to GoD trials...  <br>
<br>
Bottom line, the game needs more content for both styles, uber and casual.  Period.  End of story.  The 'all people will get to enjoy the uber content eventually' doesn't hold for PoP as I will NEVER have 70 people to get into these zones.  Period.<br>

Not anywhere close to 70%.  <br>
<br>
The problem you have is your server population.  I don't know how the Zeks work really, I have never had an interest in PK in any form.   I'm sorry there aren't enough peeps for you to work with. <br>
<br>
Wyndaria: If you complain that grass is blue, then proceed to explain why it's blue now when it used to be green, and I tell you it's green now and has always been green, and call your argument untrue after seeing just your statement of &quot;the grass is blue&quot;, why does that go against logic?  <br>
<br>
I read probably the first quarter to a third of the articles, and then scanned various sections of the rest of it.  So, yes I didn't read it, but what I did read is what I responded to, and why I wrote that they were untrue.  <br>
There may have been some valid points in the later parts, but their complaint/argument was based on something false.  <br>
If the base of an argument (or complaint) is untrue, then the argument itself is untrue. <br>
<br>
The basis for both articles (the portion that I read) was that PoP wasn't like the previous expansions because peeps couldn't get to certain spots/do things without huge raids and it was unfair because everyone paid the same amount of money.  Claiming that it wasn't like that in the original release, or any prior expansion (this is the grass is blue/used to be green comment).  My point is that there has always been content that is unavailable to the casual player, even in the original expansion, and places that you couldn't set foot into without potentially losing your body. (it's green now and has always been green) <br>
<br>
Yes, PoP was different, but it's also a logical progression based on the prior expansions.  Verant addressed two things.  1) the potential to lose your body as you explored and 2) that the guilds were getting huge and could just zerg rush anything and potentially win.  <br>
<br>
The graveyards were a good idea, but this also allowed for more restriction of content because the designers didn't intend for peeps just to poke around without a fear of losing their stuff.  With the graveyard, your body just popped up safe and ready to res.  So, no more casual exploration of places you haven't gotten to by going through earlier content. <br>
<br>
Addressing # 2 was damaging to the smaller guilds of peeps that actually used skill over numbers, and caused bunches of them to leave the game, including some of my long-time friends.  This was partially addressed with the option of keying (or small raids) to get to every place up to (not including) Sol Ro and the elemental planes.  However, this didn't let the small guilds kill the bosses.  The bosses were designed with the large guilds in mind.   Then again, so were the dragons in the original release.  <br>
<br>
The dragons were designed so you had to have a large pack of people to kill em.  And as the game grew, the creatures (especially bosses) had to have mudflation increases along with the PCs, or they would be too easy.  That capped in Velious where (from everything I've heard and read) it was endurance/zerg contests to kill bosses with stupidly large amounts of HPs.  Tons of peeps fighting for really long times to kill a boss.   They had to make changes to the way bosses worked, and make them different/difficult to keep peeps interested.  <br>
<br>
The adjustments we saw in luclin with several bosses in restricted areas, and the player base didn't complain (much).  They showed very willing to do the farming and killing necessary to get into the boss areas and restricted zones. <br>
<br>
Then came PoP, which was designed with the high end game in mind. It was billed as high end content, and high end content REQUIRED large organized guilds by this point.  Guilds that had shown very willing to go through tedious farming and large long battles to get to restricted content.  It was also designed with a specific linear storyline.  And yet, there were side quests that you could do to get into 2/3 of the expansion with small guilds, or you didn't want to take part in the story.  You just couldn't take full advantage of boss killing, just like the small guilds couldn't kill dragons or gods in the previous expansions before the next expansion came out.  <br>
<br>
As an aside,  if the mudflation wasn't there, then the new content wouldn't have any appeal to players.  There's no reason to move sideways, the goal of the game has always been to move up.  A perfect example of this is LoY, that was an alternative to PoP and offered raids and content that the small guilds were capable of.  It is essentially a flop because the small guilds are focused on what they can't have (Elemental access) rather than what they can have (doable raids with the potential for rather nice items).   <br>
<br>
LDoN was an effort to cater to the small guilds and casual players.   However, despite it's success, it still didn't appease them, they wanted to get to the elemental planes.  <br>
<br>
Then came GoD, which is a different effort to appease the big guilds and the small guilds at the same time.  There are raids there for various sizes, it's instanced, and it's got the single group quest progression and so on.  And of course, the loot is an increase over what was there before.  It's also a penalty to the big guilds because the raids are limited to 54 peeps rather than the 72 they had  been used to in PoP.  If it were better balanced/less buggy, it'd be a super expansion.  And yet, there are still those that complain because they can't get into the Elemental planes in PoP.  <br>

<br>
Not really a &quot;penalty&quot; since alot of larger guilds pre-GoD probably didn't or still don't field 54 for raids.<br>
<br>
Smaller raids = good.  BUT, there needs to be some middle ground found to where you don't have to turn people away with hard caps on raids.  Only real example I can think if is Bristlebane, to where you can engage with a certain number, and have the leftovers in reserves.  If you haven't fought Bristlebane (spoiler or whatever warning, blah)....if you have more than 36 or 42 people on his hate list, he banishes people to misty thicket, but as long as the extras stay clear of the fight, you're good to go.<br>
<br>
Raids with artificial &quot;lockouts&quot; are retarded and everyone online deserves the progression flag.  Turning people away sucks balls. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=269698">Reynaldo</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vainne>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 864<br> <font color=#330000>(6/5/04 1:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gotta agree with Slaek</span><hr size=1> Like every expansion before it, I'd assume GoD is an alternative endgame to the one before....IF you treat it as such. Wyndaria has the right idea, do sewers, start the BIC quest, and do the GoD content with the forces that you have. There used to be endless discussions about whether or not you &quot;needed&quot; VT to get to the elemental planes. Now, I think that's a moot point. Before that, people agonized about &quot;needing&quot; Ntov to go to VT.<br>
<br>
I am not that up on GoD content actually, since I have trouble wanting to be online at all, and when I was trying no one would go there--but I have noticed things dropping there that offer alternatives to elemental gear...doable with one group. In fact I am wearing some of them.<br>
<br>
My one time in Ferubi I was struck by the vast numbers of nameds that dropped halfway decent things. I suggested to my groupmates that perhaps it was designed to be a raiding zone for a small non-elemental guild...they disagreed, but I still think it could be treated as such.<br>

I am curious if anyone's guild is farming the various GoD events pre-Kod Taz and what their impressions are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=suladasbardspeed>Suladas Bardspeed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#330000>(6/5/04 2:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gotta agree with Slaek</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'll try another analogy because my first one was deemed wonky.

                 1)  Ya she seems to know but obviously you don't cevinzol.<br>
<br>
                 2) you are the one that is high on this one. You think a guild can split in 2 and do 2 raids if they have enough lol? You don't seems to grasp the concept of a raiding guild I think. There aren't enough key classes to split a raid in 2 99% of the time.<br>
<br>
 <br>
                              Either way, this whole thread is mostly crap. Neither casual or uber are black or white, I don't see the point going on 4 pages of arguement for once again nothing. You guys are beating a dead horse. Ubers want more raids and casual want more easy accessable content.I don't see how its going to change until SOE triple their numbers. They did a whole expansion for casual ( ldon) and yet the same people bitched to all hell with GoD even tho it was mostly advertised for high levels. <br>
<br>
                               Casuals will get an easy bumping with 5 More level, everything pre GoD ( and GOD for second/third tier guilds) is going to be a complete joke, thats a lot of new content for you guys but even then you won't be happy because you ll do a who all and you will see uberroxxorjoe01 in a zone you can't get in.<br>

It's a wholly owned subsidary of Sony, and now called Sony Online Entertainment (or whatever).  It's still the same place. <br>
<br>
If you don't think Verant exists, just try to use it as a company name and see how fast you get legal action.  <br>
<br>
I've gone though this in RL, I worked for a company that got bought out, and had a new name based off our new parent company, but legally we were still the original company too.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=456989" target="top">Muse Idril Galelin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,   <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=860858" target="top">Exarch Mirai Tekk'sint</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=19439.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=19439.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showPrevMessage?topicID=19439.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showNextMessage?topicID=19439.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19439.topic&index=50><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.emailToFriend?topicID=19439.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.threadControl?topicID=19439.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19439.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19439.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p201.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theconcerthallbackstage">Backstage<option value="theconcerthallcenterstage">Center Stage<option value="theconcerthallontour">On Tour<option value="theconcerthallthecriticschair">The Critics Chair<option value="theconcerthallstageleft">Stage Left<option value="theconcerthallfrm9">The Voting Booth<option value="theconcerthallfrm7">The Adventurer's Tavern<option value="theconcerthallthescriptingroom">The Scripting Room<option value="theconcerthallthegiftshoppe">The Gift Shoppe<option value="theconcerthallfrm8">The Hall of Fame<option value="theconcerthallfrm12">User Interfaces<option value="theconcerthallfrm11">Admin<option value="theconcerthallfrm13">Thread Trash Bin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall>The Concert Hall - Message Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage>Backstage</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31o<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
