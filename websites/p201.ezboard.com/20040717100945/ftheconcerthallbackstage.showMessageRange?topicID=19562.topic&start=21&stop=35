<br>
1. Changing the way we do things will undoubtedly break us, even if its only temporarily.<br>
<br>
2. Song choice and timing (twisting) is what sets the good bards apart from the bad bards.<br>
<br>
3. Twisting helps keep fly-by-night twinks/newbs out of our upper level ranks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Honestly, if your wrists are hurting, its a problem with ergonomics. I have 300 days played on my bard and I guarantee you, you can play in pain or you can play without pain. I used to play in pain till I figured out how to position myself so as to not put the strain on my wrists that causes the pain. <br>
<br>
You may also need to change your play style just a tad. You cant expect to chant kite in the same circle for 4 hours straight and not be sore.<br>
<br>
If its not real pain and you just don't like the &quot;pain in the arse&quot; of twisting, then play a different class. There's so many classes that don't require the kind of maintenance that we do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raiddinn>Raiddinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#330000>(7/4/04 12:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19562.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~</span><hr size=1> With all due respect there are a lot of people who have been putting in more than 40hrs per week typing for a lot longer and have been playing since way before 01, and there is a lot of people who cant play acceptable bards because they have pain, a lot of them got it from EQ also.<br>

Limiting people to certain classes because interacting with a service they pay for regularly (note that they pay regularly for every upgrade the company puts out to the product too) causes them RL disabilities is pretty rediculous.<br>

When I bought this product it didnt have written on the box playing the bard class will cause you and others long term disabilities, and in accordance with that I dont think it should, and since it does I believe that it should be fixed so it doesnt.<br>

<br>
Bards = twisting<br>
<br>
If you don't like it, I'm sorry, but being a bard isn't you.<br>
<br>
We are unique, and that uniqueness is what makes us. Twisting is part of what it is to be a bard.<br>
<br>
And I'm not saying the removal of twisting would destroy us. We're bards, we adapt.<br>
<br>
And, I'm not saying people who don't like twisting can't be (good) bards. They can of course. And besides there are times I don't like twisting myself.<br>
<br>
The argument that twisting wasn't intended is bs: our current songs are what we're using and they were created with twisting in mind.<br>

MQ made the game WAY more fun for me. I could talk with my friends and goof around in raid chat with all my guildies and not worry about a song droping. Anything that would cut down on the twisting I think would be a big help and make the game more enjoyable for a majority of the bards that play.

LoL But did it say that EQ was addictive? Was it listed on the original box that every 6 to 8 months you would be paying another $40 to $50 on an expantion? Of course not but I notice you still play EQ. You sound like a whiny lawyer looking for a lame excuse to sue someone. If playing a Bard causes you pain then guess what? Playing ANY character in EQ would cause you pain. The only difference is that a Bard would cause it faster. <br>

<br>
Devs intended to make bards a single song singing class, it was the players who used the limited duration of songs to 'twist' more than one.  Soon it just became the standard, like many things in EQ do.  Just like Feign Death was not intended to be a pulling tool, it was implimented as a means of clearing agro on Monks who pulled agro and consistantly died.<br>
<br>
I have played a Bard since August of 99, a druid before that.  I had no problems at all with my wrist until acouple of months ago.  Previous to that I considered posts on wrists problems to be 'not my problem', much as many of the posters here do.  <br>
<br>
Just like Jaos, I now also use a script for twisting, it is the only way I can keep playing.  All it does is a 3 or 4 song twist, whatever I need at the time.  I still have to manually slow, debuff, mez ect.  After actually using it, I strongly belive it is the way things should be.<br>
<br>
At this time my wrist is still not fully recovered, and for those who suggest playing another class.... I'd rather quit, the rest bore me to death. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ameritech.net/users/cjs27/twinkzignome.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tamsindyresoul>Tamsin Dyresoul</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#330000>(7/5/04 2:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19562.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Proposed solution to the pains of twisting.</span><hr size=1> Started bard in November of '99.  From what I've always remembered, twisting was an unintended invention of players that, like many other things, became a part of the game.  Toss it in there with kiting, FD pulling, etc.  <br>
<br>
However, unlike some of the other unintended 'features', the game has been balanced around twisting since before the first Iksar crawled out of it's egg.  Well balanced?  Maybe not.  But the ability has been taken into account for a very long time.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to today.  We are in what many might consider the twilight of EQ.  Unfortunately, not every one has the knowledge or the understanding to set up their work/play areas to be ergonomically correct.  In fact, if your like me, I still do the old 11,22,33 (sometimes 44) scenario.  Moving in on 5 years of that, it's getting old, and sometimes painful.  Not since Asteroids have I hit so many buttons <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think the main question here is how many songs up at once is considered normal or balanced?  The two answers are, of course, 3 or 4.  <br>
<br>
Setting up a system that can reliably keep 3 songs going at once is fair.  Doing the same for 4 songs is a bit beyond me since, as stated on another post I have made, seeing 4 songs in your song buff box does not equal 4 songs necessarily for your group.  Or Raid.  When two-boxing with my cleric I often noticed songs dropping on my bard while being active on cleric.<br>
<br>
Now, if you want to go this route, the question becomes how to best maintain a twist without, well, twisting.  We have seen some suggestions in this thread that aren't all bad.  From an old fart's standpoint, IF you want to go that route, make it similiar to the sometimes suggested 'Song stuck in head' AA.  You get 3 songs constant.  Start song only.  Starting a 4th song kicks the 3rd song off.  Let me explain:<br>
<br>
So, what you get is a situation where you click 3 songs in succession to start your twist. Or two, or one.  Doesn't matter as long you understand you will have a maximum of 3.  Click 1 WoZ, Click 2 WoM, Click 3 PoV, Click 4 Riz pushes PoV off and you got Riz, WoZ, and WoM.  Go to a 5th song, let's say Niv's since it's popular on the boards lately, push Niv's, you got song 1 Niv's, song 2 Riz, song 3 WoZ.  And they are persistant until you change them.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, you got a permanent 3 song twist going.  Now, here's where the bard being on top of his/her game comes in.  <br>
<br>
Song 1, Song 2, and Song 3 are going.  Want to go pull with RoT?  Click RoT and that drops song 3.  However, you can click whatever song 3 was and in a few seconds move it back to song 1.   Needless to say, stuff like clickies, selo's pants, etc, are not counted.  RoT, charm, etc, ARE counted.  If it's a song, its counted against the 3.  If its off an item, it is not.  Same on AA.<br>
<br>
Can the servers handle this, beats me.  Maybe not.  But it's late, I'm bored, and I think I screwed up my power pool on my energy/energy blaster at level 18 so.../shrug.  WTB Stamina and SO enhancements...paying...err, ok?<br>

I'd put my money on liers myself. In the begining they designed the Bards to never have more than 50% of the melee capacity of ANY other melee class simply by not giving Bards double attack. They designed the Bards at the begining to not be able to do even 30% of ANY class with damaging spells. Looking at the simple fact that, they if they hadn't expected Bards to twist a Bard would have been UTTERLY useless in ANY situation except running away, it tells anyone who saw the Bard in Beta and the first year of EQ that they INTENDED Bards to keep more than 1 song up. If a developer says otherwise he or she is lieing through their teeth or too stupid to have even been a programmer in the first place.<br>
<br>
Who was the original developer of the Bard in EQ? What was his/her name? I GUARANTEE that the person who set Bards up as a class and programmed in songs that can't last more than 18 seconds and never take more than 3.5 seconds to start up and land INTENDED Bards to be pushing keys to keep more than 1 up at a time. If the programmer said otherwise he/she was lieing to cover his/her ass later on. They simply could not have been stupid enough to not see what they were designing if they wrote the programming for it in the first place and knew what the result of their programming would be. <br>

But i dont think they will implement it.<br>
<br>
As for now, I am really happy with my Nostromo. It autotwists pretty well when you are in a rather safe environement (killing trash).<br>
I would have quit my bard without it.<br>

<br>
there are some clues as to why twisting was not intented...<br>
1. songs dont stop playing! Even songs like Bellow thats a DD never stops playing. Im pretty sure if it was fully intended to be twisted they would have just made the songs stop playing on the first pulse. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46500" target="top">Pinene</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It doesn't take 5 years for RMS/CTS to set in.  Don't blame the game at this point.<br>
<br>
- Auto twisting at this point in the game is beating a dead horse.<br>
- I think Nastomo gamepads are pretty cheap.<br>
- Wheter twisting was or wasn't intenteded is also beating a dead horse. <br>
- We DO NOT need an easier way for somone to BoT a whole group single handedly.<br>
- Do people honestly think SoE will completely rewite bard code a second time (they've done it once already), at this point in the game's life cycle?<br>
- I hope not, we'll be screwed up for months.<br>
- I hope they spend dev time on content rather than dead horses.  <br>
- We need more small group progression.  Big guilds can't keep membership up anymore.  <br>
- We need stuff to keep people interested in playing the game, Less time sinks (why do you think CoH is so popular?).<br>
- Auto buffiung a group is a feature of EQ2, hence why there are no bards in it.  So SoE has already addressed this issue in their next generation of the game.  It just won't be retroactive.<br>

You make it sound as if a bard autotwist would be hard to code or that it would somehow degrade those who prefer not to use it.<br>

Bards are all about options - I like options.<br>
