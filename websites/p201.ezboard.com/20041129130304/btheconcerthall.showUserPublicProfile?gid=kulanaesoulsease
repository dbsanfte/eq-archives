Her mother decided that Kulanae would study under the Sisters of Erollissi and sent her off to learn the sisters arts. Kulanae was impressed with the Sisters philosophies of love, but felt a draw to her father's Bardic ways. Koltai recalled his daughter and introduced her to Sylia the leader of the Songweavers Guild. There she also met swords master Regren a warrior and follower of Tunare. Regren explained the great circle of life and how all things great and small serve the Mother in their way. Kulanae instantly felt a tie to the true Mother of All.

   After attaining rudimentary knowledge of her art, Kulanae's desire for travel and excitement led her to the decadent human city of Freeport. This city fascinated her, and yet repulsed her. She was reunited with her friends Thyna and Azhami. But the bond she felt for them was more than friendship, for they had shed blood together in battle and sisters are what they became. The three journeyed far and wide and made many friends. One night they encountered two magi, one a tall dark skinned man the likes of which Kulanae had never seen. He was unlike the vile Teir'Dal that Kulanae had dealt with, so surely this must be a mysterious Erudite that she had heard whispers about. His name was Cynn, and he was with a High Elf companion. Kulanae had never understood the desire of her more "learned" cousins to spend their lives locked away in cities. Fletop, as the High Elf was known, later introduced the three to the Warriors of Wrath.  She longs for song, drink and sky, and feels some trepidation whenever entering a dark abode. Due to the manual dexterity needed to perform her songs, Kulanae also has taken up many trades to benefit herself and her friends. So my friends remember; Joy is in the ears that hear.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 				<span class="privatevalue">disabled</span>						</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="http://www.eqwatchers.com" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 		 		<span class="privatevalue">private</span>						</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
