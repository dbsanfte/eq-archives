AA and you - hof or bust</span><hr size=1> ok the hall of fame AA post is so old it's kinda funny to read sooooooooooooo.... dammit time to revamp it. This sucks on many levels which I'll cover...<br>
<br>
1. Liq was there when it all happened. Every time new AA was introduced I had finished all remotely useful skills such that by next expansion I had 20  aa saved to use. I really do not know the relative value of say bellow to a staple like combat stability.<br>
<br>
2. there are a ton of aa now to get, organizing them is going to suck.<br>
<br>
3. There is NO RIGHT WAY. Other than the total non brainer of the fade  and run 3 skills, all others are conditional to how  your bard... There just is no point getting a skill like boastful bellow if you've never once ever pulled a mob ever in your same group of monk   whatever.<br>
<br>
4. Level vs. AA. Another thing I never had to contend with so I honestly do not know. At what point do you level to 65 and say screw the AA? 65 is not so hot without as many runes floating about and charm kiting is good up until only a certain level. I simply cannot cover that in this post.<br>
<br>
5. Gates aa is sooooo silly expensive compared to pop and sol skills that the only one I can really recommend for bards not over 300 aa is run 5 for ... gasp... 15 aa and instrument mastery for 12 aa<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There's 3 main skills that really impact the way you can play a bard. I'll name them here for ease of sight...<br>
<br>
run3 at level 51 - I get run 3 at level 51 on all my twinks<br>
Fading memories at level 63 - nuff said<br>
Boastful bellow at level 63- an amazing pull tool that ends up being like an extension of your bard's body. The skill is so taken for granted by me now it's hard to explain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
here's the condensed list with *rough* order of usefulness per set.<br>
<br>
 <br>
General: You need 6 points before advancing to arch.<br>
Innate Run Speed 3 - Is the total no brainer AA of the entire game. Just run 1 allows you to pull and run away from 95% of pregates mobs and not get hit. This skill lets you run away even at low hp.<br>
Innate Regeneration 3 - 3 regen is always good and you need 6 to advance, the only other skill you can really consider here is...<br>
Innate Metabolism - level 3 confers 50% less food and water consumption. In the world of baz bought stat food, this is an amazing skill. Seriously consider this skill after run 3 for 6 in general<br>
Innate resists 5 aa total 2 resists per aa... nice but definitely for when you got aa to kill.<br>
innate stats 5 aa total 2 stats [per aa... Good to shore up weak stats after a lot of aa, some stats are done just to finish all aa<br>
Innate Lung Capacity - Junk<br>
First Aid -for bards, junk for the most part, hey if your bind would is even capped (much less used!) then you know what this does. Give you a hint though, twist nivs and mana song.<br>
New Tanaan Crafting Mastery - tradeskills are the debil, not recommended first 6 but 300  aa sure. YOu know what this skill does if you are into debil worship<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Archetype Abilities: 12 needed to advance to class skills 2 4 6 points for 3 level skills<br>
Combat Agility - IMO THE BEST arch skill for bards period bar none. getting missed not only means you don;t any damage, it also means that bash cannot interrupt your songs. MAJOR skill imo get all 3 level before all other arch skills. GET THIS SKILL OMGOMGOMG <br>
Mental Clarity - more mana regen is good for fade. this skill is much more required with a person low ft in items than it is with ft 10 . overall tradable ft is rare still but that's subject to change.<br>
Natural Durability - more hp based on equipment is nice but hardly going to help you live past your magelo profile. decent enough skill AFTER combat agility.<br>
Combat Stability - Helps mobs that hit hard hit you less, not nearly as good as combat agility but nice nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Combat Fury - melee crits are fun, sue me. level 1 is a req for boastful bellow, a class defining skill so 2 points placed here is likely.<br>
Natural Healing - 12 aa for 3 more regen, regen is good, that this skill allows you to get  1 mana from class skills as well is better imo<br>
Channeling Focus - less missed notes.... mutter<br>
Spell Casting Fury - crits on our dd songs AND procs.. crits are fun, sue me. YES IT WORKS ON WEAPON PROCS KIDS<br>
Spell Casting Expertise - no more missed notes ever on songs up to level and including level 51... selo in all it's many forms is level 51 or below as I write this. I'll let you put selo and no missed notes ever together yourself. Do not dismiss this skill as useless out of hand.<br>
Finishing Blow - have a chance to outright kill low hp mobs that are running. You cannot use fear to force a finishing blow mk?  This has two edges to it. if you kill a lot of green mobs (and light blue after the pop version of this skill) then anon snared mob running away can get owned fast enough to stave more adds. The bard part is that a finishing blow on anything will force a kill steal since they have to compare to 32k damage - not good while pleveling toons.<br>
<br>
Fear Resistance - Very situational skill. a few raid encounters in the game really like this skill, you know them when you see them. Keep in mind you are not immune to fear based effects with this skill, just resistant.<br>
Spell Casting Subtlety - dunno I will never ever ever get this aa skill ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bard Class Abilities - 3 level skills are typically 3 6 12 for a total of 18 aa, that's getting pretty hefty.. <br>
Instrument Mastery The Bard as bard skill. acts as a  .6 modifier to all instruments skills other than singing. 18 aa well spent. See <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=44.topic">Here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for more details.<br>
<br>
Scribble Notes - makes meming songs as fast as casters. adds to the ability to swap out songs under tight situation especially when combined with the right click open gems for minimal sit down time. VERY power utility skill that's cheap, not all will find it useful though<br>
Singing Mastery - does for singing what im did for everything else. Good skill. See <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=44.topic">Here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> again for the details.<br>
Physical Enhancement - 2% more ca cs nd, a no brainer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Extended Notes - extends range of group and aoe songs. NOT targeted and not offensive aoe. combined with the pop version of this skill, song range is extended 40%. that's major for aoe songs on raids and open exp like pof tables. <br>
Ambidexterity - helps the off hand swing more.. more melee dps for a melee challenged class. woot? does NOT help off hand proc rate.<br>
Body and Mind Rejuvenation - another point of mana and hp regen, pretty hefty prereqs though as we are talking like 18 aa past mc 3<br>
Jam Fest - oh yeah, the official WTF skill that finally works. This skill helps songs in weird ways and not universally, this is not the thread to explain how it works but try<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=94.topic">Here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
Acrobatics - 18 aa for well not much, our safe fall cap is too low and as a plate based tank our weight is too high. Not the worst of junk skills by sure if you selo around without lev on a lot.<br>
Advanced Trap Negotiation - 18 aa for this is an insult. A front runner for more useless bard skill ever but gates is making it work for that distinction.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Planes of Power Advanced Abilities<br>
<br>
Planar Power - raises stat cap across the board. total cap ends up at 305 for all 7 stats not a bad skill at all since str is attack, agility is avoidance, stamina is hp, int is mana and cha is missed notes. Helps if you have equipment that sets you over 255 in these stats though.<br>
<br>
Innate resists... 10 more aa worth of each flavor of resists. for 15 total aa in any one resist from here and general, you have an innate  #0 to that resist. Not shabby at all.<br>
Innate stats .... 10 more aa per stat. some stats better than others depending on gear etc. <br>
<br>
<br>
Planes of Power Class Abilities<br>
<br>
Fading Memories - omgomgomg hit 63 and stop all exp, get fading memories. 6 aa is nothing compared to the power this gives bards. Monks hate us for this so be sure to taunt them with timely emotes.<br>
<br>
Boastful Bellow - needs melee crits as a pre req so think of it as an 8 aa skill. An amazing pull toy as it's a 250 range, insta cast mini DD that can stun up to level 60 mobs. YOu need los to use it now (p0) but can be cast while you are singing another song and will change your target to that bellowed mid song. I'll let you decide how useful that is to you. Liq gives it 4 thumbs up! (I'm borrowing reeds thumbs here)  <br>
<br>
Lightning Reflexes - More combat agility omgomgomg good<br>
Harmonious Attack - THE bard as melee skill so far in game. this adds a good chunk to our pathetic melee.<br>
Innate Defense - more combat stability, not as good as the combat agility line<br>
Sionachie’s Crescendo - same as extended notes, total is  40%. A major raid skill to get.<br>
<br>
Ayonae’s Tutelage - ups the instrument cap, this does not help songs out unless you have elemental   instruments and the proper instruement/singing mastery. See <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=43.topic">Here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for info on the cap.<br>
Fury of the Ages - more melee crits!!! crits are fun, sue me. <br>
Mastery of the Past - upp the no fizzle to level 57 songs.. most notable songs here are the aoe resists (which have a higher fizzle rate) and the cure songs.<br>
Fleet of Foot - YOU go a bit faster.... not anyone else. I like this skill because I have way too many aa and for seloing other people, I follow them. Since I'm faster than anyone else, I can keep up np. this skill ups the run cap to like 168% of walk or so, nothing earth shattering but I do notice rain doesn't have it.<br>
Coup de Grace - up final blow insta kill to level 58 mobs. Actually useful for time snare is forgotten on light blues.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gates AA..<br>
<br>
work in progress so far. If anyone have a list of the skills please post it, I'm not in the mood to hand carry them over from in game.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So blah<br>
<br>
It's late, Liq couldn;t sleep when he started this but is bored enough to flop over now. please run past this, point out mistakes, opinions and keep in mind this is hall of fame bound for archive. any posts that contain good info will survive<br>
the final prune so feel free to embellish. List of how you did AA really doesn't really help since the vast majority of us pre-date gates aa. Not even sure this is the place to discuss AA vs. EXP.<br>
<br>
I'll try and hammer the rest of this out in the coming weeks. Oh and Liq is so full of it so feel free to tell him that if you see he's just flat out wrong on something.<br>
<br>
oh and pad effed up the formatting bad I prolly missed some areas were it's screwy<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

Has anyone in a similar situation had positive results in buying them I wonder....maybe on a different thread I'll contemplate that.  No hijack!<br>

Nice advise, I hope ppl understand its your recommendation and don't skip over the points you mentioned that its a roadmap not the only road. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Run 4 (for 5 AA) increases your movement speed from 30% to 40%. Not a bad purchase.<br>
<br>
Run 5 (for 10 AA) increases your movement speed from 40% to 50%. This is a lot of AAs for a 10% increase in movement. You can already outrun most pre-GoD mobs with run 3 and in most GoD zones you can selos (although too many of the mobs can keep up with you anyway). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub147.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=talerenbloodsong>talerenbloodsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#330000>(4/9/04 9:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: oh boy!

<br>
From a bardthat knows. I have had CS3 for about as soon as u could get it. I do alot of AE for raids and in the past never really grouped much. I can fade at a bad wiped raid because I am so far down on the list I could not be farther if i was afk. I do not get agro and i get alot of druids killed because they heal me. While that in itself makes geting the CS worth it, it does have a large downside.<br>
 <br>
In groups i cant get or hold agro. if tank goes, i should be next because im Plate class with good AC. How ever with CS i cant get agro off healers. I have great gear, fast weapons and lots of procs... but still cant keep agro. I have to twist 4 dots to get agro andeven then cleric cant CH.<br>
<br>
So, CS 1 is great to lower you on raids for the AE marr. CS 2 if you really hate being hit. BUT, i know think CS3 was a bad choice.<br>

AA and you - hof or bust</span><hr size=1> If you have a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22998">boomstick</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> or similar weapon that really gets your endorphins flowing, WA5 is simply mandatory.<br>
<br>
Quick Levels vs AA plotting (because I'm thinking about it and it could be moved later ;p ):<br>
<br>
It's my opinion that one should not necessarily separate the concepts of level experience and AA experience. It's all grinding, it's all the same work. For various amounts of experience, you can purchase a defense bonus, perhaps an instrument bonus, or a level's bonuses (more on this), when grouping it all together.<br>
<br>
One simply needs to weigh the bonuses that come with leveling up against the bonuses that come with other options. So just what does one get for leveling up?<br>
<br>
Well, leveling tends to require quite a bit of an experience, though its bonuses are consequently more numerous than an AA.<br>
<br>
1. When over the level of 60, you receive +5 per level to your maximum statistic caps. With levels also comes an innate bonus to your base level of hit points<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>definite... (Armor class? ATK?)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
2. Due to your power increase relative to creatures, your average rates of damage avoidance and mitigation should increase. Your odds of landing a hit should increase. Your chance to resist a detrimental spell should increase. In general, all your &quot;throws&quot; versus mobs who are either closer to equal footing or even further below you now increase. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anecdotal evidence</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
3. In general, leveling up makes you more attractive to higher level groups in higher level zones. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>subjective opinion</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
4. Depending on one's level, leveling up could open new zones in which to find an even faster rate of experience gain, or perhaps other bonuses (loot, coin, etc, availability of LDoN groups). <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>insert level locked zone list, maybe?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
5. In LDoN, the higher your group's average level, the more difficult your encounters will be, the better your found loot will be, the higher your rewarded favor points will be. Also worthy of note is that LDoN restricts the spread of levels among a group to a maximum difference of 6 levels. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>insert chart of ldon level tiers</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
6. Depending on one's level, leveling up may even open further options for spending AA points. Starting at 51 for the general points, 55 for the archetypal points, 59 for the class points, 61 for the PoP points, and 65 for most of the GoD points. (Some skills have specific level requirements higher or lower than surrounding skills of the same tier. Gates has skills at 55, 61, and 65, etc, for example) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>definite</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
7. Last but not least, every level for bards opens up new songs, being as we don't have a ton of songs, most of them pack a lot of power into one scroll. Depending on your preferred method of experience, this factor alone could drive you to level to achieve something which would shoot your exp gain up tremendously. Many choose to level to 64 for the bards' last charm. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Early yet, not sure what other benefits/detriments to list of leveling up, but just keep in mind when considering whether to level or to grind aa points the time you'll spend associated with either to reach your goal(s).<br>
<br>
Also do consider that while buying AA points are almost fully benefits, leveling has its detrimental side effects, such as &quot;outleveling&quot; your friends if they don't keep up, or being forced to move to new zones to find experience. Another factor is availability of spells for one's level -- post 50, songs are not all purchased at merchants, and have to either be found from players or gained through loot drops.. many are very rare, others are very common. If you cannot feasibly acquire songs for a given level (typically only applies to 65), then you may want to hang around your current level and make the most of your time until things change. AA points have few detrimental side effects, Spell Casting Subtlety for Bards being the one example I can think of off the top of my head (don't know a single bard that has bought it, personally, hehe)<br>
<br>
Going for the best bang-for-your-buck in terms of time investment will generally lead you to follow the path many bards take, leveling a bit, getting a few crucial points, leveling further, and grinding for a good while before finishing levels.<br>
<br>

AA and you - hof or bust</span><hr size=1> Let's list the GoD aa's and get some discusion on those, personal experiences and such please.<br>
<br>
Swift Journey-- Run 4 and Run 5.  Good for pulling GoD supposedly, not sure how it affects AoE/dot kiting.<br>
<br>
Convalescence--Two levels of Regen.<br>
<br>
Lasting Breath--More time on the air breathing meter basically.<br>
<br>
Packrat--Carry more shizzle at a lesser or more efficient weight.<br>
<br>
Weapon Affinity--Proc more, nice nice!<br>
<br>
Persistent Casting--It says creates the possibility of casting while stunned BUT not positive on the meaning of this.  Are we able to not have our songs interrupted once stunned or does it mean once stunned we can then start a song up?  I have level 1 of this and can't tell with a few tests via Highsun.  Anyone help me here?<br>
<br>
Tune of Pursuance--better Tracking<br>
<br>
Improved Instrument Mastery--a .2 improvement to instruments, excluding voice of course.  Good stuff.  This and IM3 gives a total of .8 mod on top of whatever instrument you have.<br>
<br>
Improved Singing Mastery--a .2 improvement to voice(singing) based songs.  If you're already at the 3.9 cap or above this is useless until at least one level of EoT is trained.  You won't see the full benefit if already capped until all 3 levels of EoT are trained, i.e. 4.2 cap.<br>
<br>
Exullant Bellowing--increases the level of mob you can stun with boastful bellow, 5 tiers.  Assuming the level of mob goes up 1 each tier you train?  No idea.<br>
<br>
Echo of Taelosia--Increase the overall instrument and singing cap .1 per rank trained, bringing our new overall cap to a whopping 4.2.  (A lvl 65 bard with JF3, epic, amp, vots,  sm3 sits at a 4.0 voice mod, before this that type of bard was not getting his last .1 off his last rank of SM, one level trained in EoT will give you that last .1.  From there it is another 17 aa pts to get another .1 increase for this same bard, Ouch!  That's ISM at 12 and 2nd rank of EoT at 5 pts.)<br>
<br>
Internal Metronome--More missed notes flimflam, 5 ranks.  Anyone have?  How is it?<br>
<br>
Critical Affliction--Chance to crit on our dots, doubles your damage.  I purchased all 3 ranks of this and turned dot damage on to see all the purrty numbers.  This didn't impress me much honestly.  I record my kill times constantly and didn't notice much of an overall increase of dps.  It might make a bigger difference on mobs with higher hitpoints because you have more time and therefore chances to crit, also the better the instrument the more this will be worth it.  This does not let you crit on every tick of your dot.  3 ticks a dot, could crit on any one of those ticks and not the other two.  Just so ya know.<br>
<br>
Sinister Strike--Increase in damage in offhanded weapons.  Haven't gotten this yet, anyone able to share their experiences with this?<br>

Extended notes works on all forms of group and aoe beneficial songs. Detrimenal songs and targeted songs are not helped.<br>
<br>
Examples...<br>
<br>
mana song 55 - works<br>
aoe mana song 58 - works<br>

I have had this a while and it works as follows:<br>

If you are in the middle of casting a song and you get stunned, there is a chance that the song will continue casting while you are stunned.

Extended Notes and Ayonae's Tutelage USED to increase the range of our detrimental AE songs (like Melody of Mischief, for instance).  This was changed in early 2004 and now these two AAs do not affect any song that is targeted or has detrimental effects.<br>

I bought 4 levels right off the bat when Gates came out and wasn't impressed, though it was a noticeable decrease in missed notes.  I bought my 5th level this past weekend just to finish it off and I still miss notes pretty frequently, though I don't think I've gotten more than one in a string.<br>
<br>
I would say don't bother getting this skill unless you're completely flush with AA's.<br>
<br>
Persistent Casting.<br>
<br>
I've only got one level of this but after actually seeing it in action I'm not going to rush to finish this off.  There aren't many situations when it is critical for me to have my song continue playing when I get stunned.  It's not like my song is a complete heal on the tank or anything.  <br>
<br>
I've also got Sinister Strikes, Critical Affliction, IM and some Weapon Affinity, and other than the IM, I haven't really found any of the Gates AA's to be must have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub147.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melodion>Melodion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://groups.msn.com/_Secure/0QQDcAtkTM5Mbkv7y119DKiueal1KXhB*CxBy!RH8ZbOth3FfzKRjfg0fFp78r*juE1wSjCFvFeBS9KW3ucy4iXMUbOvcKfEBt" BORDER=0></span><br> Posts: 70<br> <font color=#330000>(4/14/04 11:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: oh boy!

1. missed notes per sing<br>
2. streaks of missed notes.<br>

I'll prolly set it up so it's mana song recast every 1/5th second because missed notes only happen on the start. streaks will be easy to spot. Dunno yet so feel free to chime in.<br>

AA and you - hof or bust</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Persistent Casting</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - I have the 3rd level of this and I am really starting to like it.  As it was said above, this ability lets you continue casting after you have been stunned.  It does not let you start a new song until the stun has worn off.  I find this AA useful in 3 scenarios.  The most useful time is when i'm tanking and the mob's melee is stunning me.  It helps me keep those 4 or 5 dots on the mob to keep agro.  Another time it is very nice is when I'm trying to mez mobs and they are beating on me and again stunning me, especially when it is more than one mob.  Also, of course this is nice when fighting mobs with AoE stuns such as AHR or Grioihin the Wise.  I'm not sure if it helps cast through bashes or kicks, but when I get the message, &quot;You are stunned&quot;, i've noticed it helps a good portion of the time. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=618862" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.kruegs.net/TlaaneSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub147.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elfvis>Elfvis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#330000>(4/17/04 2:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm</span><hr size=1> liq was drunk when he posted this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://b31.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moshkiae>Moshkiae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 1942<br> <font color=#330000>(4/21/04 8:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: oh boy!

<br>
I do pull a lot, at least in almost all adventures and will do FM and CAgility after that I can see ... I am in a guild that does raid a lot, and have given serious thought to resists, as it makes life much easier all around ... but am not sure if I will burn these so soon. On my Cleric I DID burn the MR one quickly and it was excellent help in the EP's, where some AE's are really bad. <p>Moshkiae Soulwriter, the non role playing Bard / Mo'riae Soulmender - Cleric</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://b31.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=liquidated>Liquidated</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grumpy Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 3514<br> <font color=#330000>(4/24/04 3:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm</span><hr size=1> as heretical as this may sound, plugging aa that just happenes to arrive into exhultant bellow... the skill is kinda neat.<br>
<br>
Mind you in a very much  &quot;gee that's kinda nice if it wasn;t 45 aa&quot; way. Nice to slap those idiot casters on pull and duck around the corner before they can start their cast.<br>
<br>
So liq has not official taken bellow from completely usesless to well it's better than packrat! or that missed notes aa as it stands now.<br>
