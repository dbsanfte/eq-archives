<br>
The topic I would like to discuss today is song duration.  As bards, our abilities to affect our environment comes in the form of music.  Since day one, songs have been divided in distinct subcategories, each one governing the duration of the song depending on its type.  After many expansions and additions to our song repertoire, certain songs have been added to categories that don't match their characteristics.<br>
<br>
First, let's talk about the categories.  There are three main branches of songs; One shot effects, Standard 3 tick, and Long effects.  The first branch is fairly self-explanatory, and it is mostly detrimental DD type songs that fit in that branch.  The old school lvl32 manasong used to be part of this branch, before it got the nerf bat.  <br>
<br>
The second branch; standard 3 tick, can be subdivided into 2 other branches.  For lack of better terms, let's call them active and passive.  An active 3 tick song would be something like Chorus of Marr, where each time the server ticks, mana and hp are added to players.  In between server ticks, there is absolutely no difference whether the song is on or not.  When using this song in a twist, you only have to refresh it before the server ticks a 4th time while this song is on.  A passive 3 tick song would be something like Call of the Muse.  The song will take effect (overhaste and detrimental focus) as soon as it is cast, and will fade as soon as the server ticks a 3rd time while this song is on.  Hence a player using this song will have to refresh it a whole tick earlier than an active type song because the effect is constant.<br>
<br>
The third branch; Long effects, includes a lot of different types of songs.  From the enthrall type songs that will last until the 4th server tick even tho they're passive, to the 5 tick amplification and Lull, to the 1 minute charm and slows, to the 2.5 mins selos, to the indefinite duration faction song.  Songs that take a while to refresh also fall in this category (i.e. Divine Aura song).<br>
<br>
There are 2 lines of songs that I would like to discuss.  The first is the Lull line, there is the lvl 8 one, and the lvl 61 one.  Currently both last 5 ticks.  The lvl 61 Silent Song of Quellious should be changed to last 7 ticks.  These are passive type songs, and already have a chance to fade early, so currently a bard has at best up to 29 seconds of lull time.  If it were changed to 7 ticks, it would be 37-41 seconds of lull time.  This 40 seconds is what I believe was intended with the original lull nerf, when they wanted to bring it in line with the other classes, they just misunderstood how bard song duration works.<br>
<br>
The second line is the bard-malo/tash line, there is the lvl 56 one, and the lvl 65 one.  Currently both last 3 ticks.  These are again passive type songs, meaning that the effect will be on a mob between 13-17 seconds.  This is an outrage.  Change Occlusion of Sound to last 5 ticks.  This will give the group up to 29 seconds to cast other debuffs on a mob.  Keep the requirement of the drums, and prevent the song from refreshing for 2 ticks, à la lvl 60 Lost Comp or lvl 64 Requiem of Time.  Change Harmony of Sound to last 7 ticks.  This will give the group up to 41 seconds to cast other debuffs on a mob.  Keep the requirement of the drums, and prevent the song from refreshing for 2 ticks.  This would be much more in line with the intent of the song.<br>
<br>
All other casters have had the ability to extend the duration of the spells in one form of another over the years.  Bards haven't.  Even a 1 tick increase in song duration across the board would be a 25-33 percent power boost to some songs, so a general extension is ill advised.  If the two song lines discussed above are reformed, then I can perhaps offer a compromise for a splendid AA ability.<br>
<br>
Improved Song Duration (3 ranks of it)<br>
<br>
Each rank trained in this ability will increase the duration of songs that already last longer than 3 ticks by one tick.<br>
<br>
This would be a wonderful addition to our arsenal, and would not be overpowered because it only affects songs that will receive a small but substantial boost in power (e.g. 150 sec to 156 sec selos, 60 sec to 66 sec slow).  It would also finally give bards something they've been missing for a long time now, a one minute duration Harmony of Sound.<br>

Frigging annoying that sometimes a song lasts 13secs sometimes 18.  In theory a bard should be able to have 4-5(even 6) songs up, 3 sec cast time, 18 sec durations. <br>
However, due to server tick timer its never the case. Even on the best of days keeping 4 contantly up is impossible. More often then not one will drop. Then tack on missed notes, and that dam drop song bug (song hits JUST as the song drops and you get a stop song message, a song landed message, then anothewr stopped song message).<br>
If i was to have designed bards song casting system it would consisted of a song box and you just drag the songs you want into it and they would ALL be pulsed ever 12 seconds.<br>
Mashing keys every 3 seconds is dam annoying and in no way fun. Why should i have to consentrate on the game 100% of the time when classes like warriors, rogues, and most casters can make a nice hotkey to do 10-30seconds worth of commands. This is mostly an issue with missed notes. Its primarly because of that dam annoy &quot;feature&quot; we have to focus so much dam attention to playing songs. Its not like anything we have is so important that it involves so much attention. It would be like adding a random &quot;your spell is about to collapse&quot; on cheal every 3 seconds as its casting and if you didnt press a button right away cheal wouldnt land.<br>
<br>
Sure people say, twisting is the skill that makes a good bard stand out. FUCK that. Twisting makes me fucking sleepy. It makes me bored it MAKES MY FUCKING HAND HURT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.<br>
<br>
HAHA i guess i went on a bit of a rant there. But hell ive been twisting for over 5 years. I think i have that right :P <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46500" target="top">Pinene</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Main Point: All casters get AAs to extend their spells and get the benefit of spell haste, how come bards don't too?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There is no good reason why we don't. That should be addressed in the next batch of AAs we see from SOE. What real objections can there be to allowing us this simple courtesy that is extended to all casters BUT NOT bards? This would not overpower bards at all. In a standard experience group, how many additional songs beyond the boring standard four (riz/muse, zek, PoV, Marr) would you want to twist during the battle? Charisma? AC buff? Niv's regen? Even if we could add a song into the standard four it is hardly going to make your group materially stronger or kill faster imho.<br>
<br>
I want SOE to introduce a bard AA (maybe require 300 AAs before you can activate it) that for each level will permit the bard's song to be extended one tick. It could be three to five levels of this. <br>
<br>
If for some reason SOE thinks that extending song duration would be too powerful, then I suggest that they let us extend song duration for at least the following song abilities: Mez, lull, slow, debuff, charm. There is no way that this could be overpowering.<br>
<br>
Well those are my thoughts. <br>
<br>
Note: I can still twist four pretty reliably even after DX9.<br>

<br>
I'd have to think about being able to twist 5 or 6 songs.  Given I only have 8 spell gems, I always have ~3 set aside for non-twist use.  I am not sure I would have 6 songs to twist unless they increased it to 10 spell gems <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR><BR>

I kinda think that too much twisting these days actually hurts in many spots where lag is already a major issue ... for example, I would not twist during a RZtW fight, and trim down the schedule to 2 songs for effectiveness and make sure that they are being received. You can see in a 2 box that sometimes the twisting is not getting there, or that some songs don't arrive for the amount of time that they should ... one icon lasts 1 second, and some 3 seconds, despite all of them supposedly having to be there for 3 seconds, or more.<br>
<br>
All in all, if we use any other games as guidelines, this is the first class to cross over and also the last one ... DAoC made sure that twisting was not possible in the early days, and then any other games I have seen that include the equivalent of a Bard, also do not allow for twisting of any kind, and EQ2 won't either, and neither will it have a Bard anywhere near the design that this version of EQ has, and thus, I believe, it will help ensure that the new games will not be able to survive into the higher realms and levels ... plain and simple. That's not to say that the Bard is not the only, and most important class in this game of EQ1, but it is to say that its role is too important in the actual success of any Guild and upper level work that we do. Without a similar class, no game out there stands a chance to even come close to gaining the high level players that this game has been able to keep and work with.<br>
<br>
All in all, what I think SoE should do, is accept the Bard, as the one design that separates this game from all others, as one of the most inventive class designs, and start working to help define it better instead of killing it. The day that we get so nerf'd that we are not important anymore, or we are just like all the other classes ... this game will be over.<br>
<br>
I guess that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery ... but programmers out there are too afraid of doing something creative and different ... to keep the game ten steps above all the competition ... but some leaders at SoE obviously don't see that, or understand that ... and will work on killing the timing and twisting ... in favor of the 3 bard module that DAoC already has for EQ2 ... how original of SoE!<br>
<br>
Go ahead ... tinker with song duration and kill the game! <p>Moshkiae Soulwriter, the non role playing Bard / Mo'riae Soulwriter - Cleric</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=astuce999>astuce999</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#330000>(6/17/04 2:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19506.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Song Duration</span><hr size=1> I'm not sure if your post was referring to mine specifically or to the others below it, would you care to please specify if getting songs extended across the board is what would &quot;kill the game&quot;, to which I agree, or any type of song extension at all.<br>
<br>
When you say that sony needs to &quot;accept the bard&quot;, I strongly believe that the arguments I posted in my first post do reflect that as well.  <br>
<br>
Would you kindly dissect my post with things you agree or disagree with, I mean, if you have better things to do I won't think you're a jerk, but I would really appreciate more feedback from people who have critical thinking skills.<br>
<br>
As in, while I do agree that DX9 has its problems, it didn't really relate to what I was trying to convey.<br>

 I would comfortably be able to do a 4 song rotation add a 5th and ignore the songs wearing off and adjust for missed notes or not recovered yet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 But damn it has become so frustrating now to play max 3 songs and miss a note amongst that and screw the rot up.<br>
<br>
 They (SOE)  need to do something about it without the cost of AA's we had it before DX9 we should have it afterwards. <br>
<br>
 I don't believe there has been any big impact on any other class due to the DX9 change over. <br>
<br>
 No other class is soooo limited to the tick timer as bards, my usual is to bug it every night before logging so the peeps in charge read it but probably have me on an ignore list somewhere in the dark little dungeons <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I mean 4 song buff twist... riz, mana, warsong for example with pslam as a 4th optional ALWAYS dropped 1 songs randomly for a brief bit of time.<br>
<br>
IF I was unlucky to do the refresh on fade bug where nothing gets refreshed... i.e. if I recast pslam just as it fades, I lose the song period.<br>
<br>
I've never ever ever been able to twist more than 3 buff songs with no drop off, this with a low ping cable connect nearish the servers. It's just not possible since eq started.<br>
<br>
Since I stick to 3 songs standard because 100% coverage is manditory, I'm not sure what dx9 has done to twisting 4.<br>
<br>
But to post that you were able to keep 5 songs up pre dx9 just leads me to think you have no bloody clue what you are posting or are including clicks and longer lasting duration songs like song of sustinance.<br>
<br>
So really if you want something fixed how about explain exactly what happens cause I still don;t know what people are talking about.<br>
<br>
Explain the dx9 thing please.<br>

In general, as I said before and everyone here should know, twisting was the one thing that caused SoE to take a long hard look at what they accidentally strated and in the early days, folks could easily see with ShowEq that they were overlapping, which led to twisting. Since then, just about all songs were designed to cut down the benefit possible in these situations, if not to prevent &quot;leaks&quot; or extended situations where a song might benefit more, and longer than it should.  This, leads to game design issues, and class design, and all other games have made an effort to kill this quickly, thus effectively relegating the &quot;bard&quot; to just another class in the game, and (in my opinion) to kill their game and upper level possibilities, since I believe that the Bard design is what makes this possible in EQ .. plain and simple. Not to say that other classes are not helping, or a part of it ... the idea is that it helped bring this game to where it is today.<br>
<br>
In general, when reading any information about EQ2 and seeing the prrogressions in other games, and their deaths, just goes to show you that everyone is trying to make sure another &quot;bard&quot; can not exist ... and I believe that any tuning to tighten up, or effectively prevent, twisting, or change the duration of songs, will tend to lead to serious class balance issues, and thus create other problems. <br>
<br>
I can see that they might try to say something like ... we will extend song durations, but take out twisting ... which seems to be the norm in other games, but in the end, what is clear is that this does not work, and neither does any game out there develop a high level content and work that can rival EQ ... and I hope that SoE sees that ... sure, go ahead and give shammies bigger and better resists and kill the AE resists we have, for example, of the Wind/Chorus songs by giving Enchanters better mana regen songs for Level 65 folks ... it won't matter, you can't improve the 10 seconds on CH ... meaning that the fine line will collapse and the upper level game will fall apart. These are things that are all tied to the song duration, as an example, and will prevent improvements or major changes ... be they DX9 or DS10 (deep-shit 10!) ...<br>
<br>
As one bugger once said ... new ideas with the old code, so they don't have to add code - just do variations upon a theme - and this means that the old code limitations cause problems, which can not be fixed. I don't think that is the real issue. I believe there are other issues ... and we will know them better when we see the carbon copy bards in EQ2 that came from DAoC! <p>Moshkiae Soulwriter, the non role playing Bard / Mo'riae Soulwriter - Cleric</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=occlusion>Occlusion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#330000>(6/23/04 11:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19506.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Song Duration</span><hr size=1> The only way 4-5 is possible without droppage is with a Water lute and/or BoH.

It doesn't account for missed notes, but if I had none of those I would have near 100% uptime for four songs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessageRange?topicID=19506.topic&start=21&stop=30>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showPrevMessage?topicID=19506.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showNextMessage?topicID=19506.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19506.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.emailToFriend?topicID=19506.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.threadControl?topicID=19506.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19506.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19506.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p201.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theconcerthallbackstage">Backstage<option value="theconcerthallfrm14">The Musical Scales<option value="theconcerthallcenterstage">Center Stage<option value="theconcerthallontour">On Tour<option value="theconcerthallthecriticschair">The Critics Chair<option value="theconcerthallstageleft">Stage Left<option value="theconcerthallfrm9">The Voting Booth<option value="theconcerthallfrm7">The Adventurer's Tavern<option value="theconcerthallthescriptingroom">The Scripting Room<option value="theconcerthallthegiftshoppe">The Gift Shoppe<option value="theconcerthallfrm8">The Hall of Fame<option value="theconcerthallfrm12">User Interfaces<option value="theconcerthallfrm11">Admin<option value="theconcerthallfrm13">Thread Trash Bin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall>The Concert Hall - Message Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage>Backstage</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31q<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
