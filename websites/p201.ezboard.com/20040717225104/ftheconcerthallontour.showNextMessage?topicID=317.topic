Well, a lot bored.  My friends and I started trying to do “old content” with a single group.  Around the time that VP got revamped, we started experimenting with killing dragons there with one group.  When we started doing so, we weren’t uber by any stretch of the imagination, and we died a lot of silly deaths figuring out how to play there safely.  The purpose of this guide is to share enough of what I’ve learned so that other potential tourists can skip over the bloody figuring-it-out part and get on to the sightseeing.<br>
<br>
Why would anyone want to do this?  All dragon loot is no drop, and if you can single group VP, most of it will rot.  The key quest is damned annoying at best, torturous at worst and there are plenty of ways to spend your time in game that will be more “efficient” as far as progression.  All I can say is that single-grouping VP is fun and that the zone is retro-cool in a way that old-school players can appreciate.  <br>
<br>
What kind of group do you need for this?  I believe that six level 65 players with ornate or Luclin level gear can do this without much trouble; five with elemental gear is fine, and four with time gear.  There are some things you MUST have.   You need a bard – resists are key.  You need a rogue to open doors.  You need a tank with decent gear and AA.  You need a cleric with reasonable FT.  You do not need a slower.  You do not need a chanter.  If you resist the AE’s, your cleric doesn’t run out of mana and you have enough DPS to exceed dragon regen, you can do this.<br>
<br>
Here are some things you should know:<br>
<br>
1) Nothing is mezzable.<br>
2) All dragons can charm and roar (sometimes they don’t).<br>
3) Most dragons will gate.  Mana drain is a MUST.<br>
4) Some wurms and all drakes see invisible.  You can make long runs with invis and the occasional bard lull, you really don’t need to clear much trash.<br>
5) Beware UberWurm.  I haven’t seen him for a while, but twice I have encountered a normal guardian wurm (well, he conned blue and had the same name as the others) who hit quite hard (1300ish?) and regenned so fast that 2 level 65 rogues only got him to 96 with disc.  I spoke to a guide about him, hopefully he’s been fixed and no longer spawns.  But if he does and you meet him, don’t say you weren’t warned.<br>
6) Rare guardian wurms have instant respawn.  If it happens, just kill the new one… it probably won’t also be instant respawn.<br>
7) Many mobs will run on low health.  Snare is useful but we’ve done without it before.  This is mostly a problem with mobs that live near caster drakes / dragons who may sow them.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Some dragons come with pets.  It’s worthwhile to have your DPS person put them down to keep them off of casters.  Dragons WILL charm even if they have a pet, so leaving it alive buys you nothing.<br>
9) Always have MR and the appropriate other resists up when you pull a dragon.  Success is mostly a function of resisting the AE’s, don’t get sloppy and ignore basic buffs.<br>
10) Dragons no longer roam.  Hoshkar lives in his den, Silverwing lives in a place I call “the drake room”.  It’s the room with the locked door to Phara Dar’s lair.<br>
11) You don’t need to slow the dragons.  Their melee is a joke, really.  If you have a shaman, she may want to dot or nuke.  It will help more, honestly.  If their melee is an issue, you’re in over your head.<br>
<br>
Keys to Success:<br>
<br>
1) Bard resists are key.  You must resist the AE’s.  Having your tank or cleric charmed, tossed into the lava or whatever is a real pain.  Everyone should be in melee range of the dragon and within bard song range.  The bard is singing PoV and everyone must be in range.  Don’t let resists drop, there’s nothing else you’re doing that is more important and you don’t need four songs up that bad.<br>
2) Gating dragons suck.  Most if not all of them will gate.  Ervaj’s Lost Composition is a must here, drain him dry.  You can tell if a dragon is really gating: if you see “Hoshkar begins to cast the gate spell” then nothing else, he’s OOM and not going anywhere.  If you see “Hoshkar begins to cast the gate spell” then “Hoshkar begins to cast a spell” then very bad things are about to happen to you.<br>
3) Control locals.  Most stuff respawns in about 15 minutes. <br>
4) Disspell is a must.  Annul or otherwise buff-strip every dragon you pull.  Some dragons show up substantially self-hasted or otherwise buffed.  I’ve heard rumors that they cast a huge regen buff on themselves, but I’m not sure.  Just disspell them to be safe.<br>
5) Understand Kunark aggro radius.  Dragons have HUGE aggro radius and a huge chase range.  They will be aggro on you before you see them and they will pursue you across the zone.  All other VP mobs have tiny chase radius.  This is going to be key in letting you pull singles.<br>
<br>
The players:<br>
<br>
Here’s some info on the dragons’ AE’s and other bits of info.  All AE’s are MR based except Hoshkar and Nexona.  MR is always a must to resist dragon charm and dragon roar.<br>
<br>
Hoshkar: He’s a shaman, comes with a wolf pet.  His AE is quite nasty : DR based, slow and 1250dd.   Many people consider him the hardest of the dragons.  He does gate.  Have someone with a disease cure up – his slow is cureable.<br>
<br>
Silverwing: She’s a chanter, she’ll show up with an enchanter animation and she hastes all the mobs in “the drake room”.  She also self-hastes and runes herself.  Dispell the crap out of her.  She will gate.  Her AE is MR based gflux with about 1250dd.  I consider her the hardest in VP for a single group.<br>
<br>
Phara Dar: She’s a caster of some variety, but she has no pet.  Her AE is 900dd and 9 second stun, MR based and easy to resist.  She does gate.<br>
<br>
Nexona: Shadowknight with skeleton pet, expect a 1k-ish HT on the pull.  AE is FR based dot with 500 dd per tick, snare and 500dd on cast.  You might need a group heal during this dragon if folks get dotted, have the cleric mem it in case.  I don’t think he gates.<br>
<br>
Druushk: No idea on this guy’s class, no pet.  AE is MR based 1500dd and dispell, easy to resist.  I don’t think he gates.<br>
<br>
Xygoz: Not sure on class.  I think he’s the best looking of the Kunark dragons, so take an appreciative look while you’re killing him.  AE is MR based, silence.  Bard MUST have resists up when this guy arrives.  I believe he gates.<br>
<br>
Getting started: The rest of this guide will walk you through how my group sets up and moves around to avoid killing tons of trash.  <br>

<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/latuttle/vpmap.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
My thanks to Sika, of Lanys, for this map which I've marked up to illustrate some points.  It's the best VP map I've ever seen.<br>
<br>
The first dragon you kill will be Hoshkar.  He’s easy to pull to near zone in, so if this is your first time, don’t skip him as it’s an easy CR if you have issues.  When you zone in, there is a bridge straight ahead of you and a safe area down to your left by the lava.  The area on the map marked “1” is where we kill Hoshkar.  There are a few wandering guardian wurms, and 5 static racnars/wurms in the area around “1”.  Kill them all.<br>
<br>
Move fast, you’re on a timer now – you need to kill Hoshkar before respawn.  There are two more racnars and some wandering wurms at the top of the ramp and on the bridge.  Pull them to your group.  Now, you need to get Hoshkar, which can be a pain unless you understand how Kunark mobs handle aggro.  Make sure your rogue has sow, and send him hide/sneak into Hoshkar’s lair.  He’s your spotter.  Be invisible and move toward’s Hoshkar’s lair.  Hoshkar will probably aggro you before you see him – that’s what the rogue is for.  Have him tell you when Hoshkar begins to chase, and just run back to your group.  Hoshkar is sow’d, so don’t diddle around, get back – he is coming.  Don’t worry about adds – Kunark chase radius is your friend.  Hoshkar will chase you all the way back to zone in if you run that far, but those racnars and wurms won’t chase you once you’re maybe 200 feet away, and you killed everything that was close to your group.  Remember to use fading memories when Hoshkar arrives, though, so mobs out there aren’t aggro on you and wandering around spreading that aggro.<br>
<br>
Dispell the crap out of him on incoming (or have another do it).  Have resists up when he gets in range so you don’t eat that AE.  If the entire group is in melee range, you should all be in song range (bard under the dragon’s belly if you don’t have song-range extension AA’s).  Kill it, it’s not that hard once he’s dispelled and his pet is down.  Don’t forget to mana drain him because he will gate.<br>
<br>
If you fall to Hoshkar, figure out why.  Did you take AE’s?  If so, were resists up – was everyone in range?  Did your tank lose aggro?  Was the tank slowed?  Were you doing damage to Hoshkar?  Dragons have very high regen.  The damage from tank/bard melee is probably just barely keeping up with that regen.  It’s your DPS person that’s putting the dragon down, really.  Did someone get charmed?  Did you have max MR resists up on the pull?  <br>
<br>
Once Hoshkar is dead, Silverwing is next.  Follow the purple line through the “racnar room” (2 on the map) to the area I labeled 3.  Along this route, there may be see invis wurms – if there are, lull them.  I have never encountered a see-invis racnar.  Somewhere between 2 and 3 you’ll encounter your first drake.  It will see invis and it will aggro.  Anticipate that and kill whatever wurms will add anyway.<br>
<br>
A note about VP drakes.  I have no idea what their problem is, but often drakes will entirely ignore the puller and prefer to sit there and nuke your casters.  Often, I can literally run up to a drake and melee it, and it will ignore me, refusing to give chase or fight me, preferring to wait on the casters.  The most likely explanation is that drakes have a very large aggro radius and are in fact aggro long before you get to them, yet for some reason they don’t give chase.  As the healers heal, the drake builds up aggro on them, and thus ignores your measly bard taunt attempts and waits for a chance to eat the cleric.  Whatever… just don’t be surprised if it is, in fact, your cleric that ends up pulling the drakes quite by accident.<br>
<br>
Area “4” is where we usually kill Silverwing.  This pull is somewhat harder.  There are some drakes and racnars at the entrance to the building where SW lives.  Kill them.  Send in your rogue to watch silverwing.  Start pulling whatever trash you can from the hallway leading up to Silverwing – at some point, she will aggro and come for you.  Be sure you dispell the heck out of her (she self-hastes) and mana drain her dry.  When she gets low health, she will try to run for the drake room.  Don’t let her get there, that would be bad (clerics nuke at 10 percent health or save discs for low health, whatever).<br>
<br>
Now that she’s dead, it’s time for the first really insane thing you’ll need to do today.  See the area I marked “C1” on your map?  You need to get there.  There is a massive room full of drakes and a locked door between you and C1.  <br>
<br>
If you feel conservative and highly aware of your own mortality, start clearing the drake room.  <br>
<br>
If you feel fiesty, don’t.  Send the rogue ahead to open the door.  There are two racnars (perhaps) at the door to the drake room – if you haven’t killed them yet, do so.  There are also two racnars along the green line I drew through the drake room, then two more at the locked door before “C1”.  Run ahead and lull the two racnars in the drake room and the two at the door if you can before your group gets there.  The drakes will be nuking the snot out of you (have PoV up) but ignore them.  Call your party in, run to C1.  In all likelihood, a racnar or two has come along with you.  Kill them, then camp out.  Congrats, you just saved yourself the trouble of clearing a ton of annoying drakes.  <br>
<br>
Phara Dar is down the hall.  Clear the roamers in that hallway – you will come to a door with two racnars.  We usually pull PD to the top of the ramp looking down on the racnars.  Pull the two door racnars and send in your rogue to spot.  You can try pulling the drakes inside PD’s first door, but she’s probably going to aggro before you manage it. Once again, Kunark chase radius is your friend.  Run back when she aggros, she will come the drakes will not.<br>
<br>
Once PD is dead, you need to move your party to “C2”.  This move is slightly harder than the one you did to get to “C1”.  In addition to the drakes and racnars in the drake room, there are racnars and wurms just outside the room between you and your camp.  Use eyes / lull to lull what racnars you can in the drake room, and run ahead of your party and lull what you can outside of the arch (I usually lull while deftdancing then fade).  There’s really no way to avoid it, you’re going to get a small train of racnars and wurms here, just try to minimize it.  Normally, we get 3-4; you really can handle this.  One time someone followed me too closely (so I didn’t get a chance to do my deftdance lull bonanza) and we got 7-8 racnars/wurms and two drakes.  Somehow we survived, but I wouldn’t want to do that again.  Having AE slow up might be a good idea, though I always forget.  This is the easiest place to wipe, so spend what time you need checking out the lay of the land and figuring out how you’re going to get out of the drake room alive.    Once you are out of the drake room and not fighting, camp out again to clear drake aggro.<br>
<br>
The rest of your walk through VP is really quite easy.  From here, there are few drakes and only the occasional see-invis wurm.  Area “5” is the mural room.  Stop and have a look.  As you enter, the first painting on the right shows Veeshan scarring Norrath to make the Great Divide.  It’s really quite interesting to see the detail that went into this zone, especially when you think about how few people ever got to look around and enjoy it since we were all being dragged and necro summoned around this zone when it was a raid destination.  Regardless of how people did it, sightseeing wasn’t an option.<br>
<br>
From area “6”, there are three doors.  Each leads to one of the remaining three dragons. The door on the right leads to Nexona – it’s a long hallway to another door, much like what you travelled to kill Phara Dar.  The other two lair areas are more compact.   With the exception of  Xygoz, who silences, these three are quite easy.  Some people are a bit confused by the drawbridges.  Pullers / spotters will need levitate – click on the bridge itself to get it to lower.  Beware when you’re pulling Xygoz and Druushk - their aggro range is quite large and once you go through their first door, the dragon isn’t far away at all.  You will certainly aggro these dragons before you see them, so work with your spotter.  <br>
<br>
Each of the dragons has a zone-out in his lair.  I can’t recall where all of them go, but the one in Xygoz’s lair goes to Swamp of No Hope in the reaver tunnels.  It really couldn’t be less conveniently located.  If you’re going to “walk out” of VP when you’re done, you might not do Xygoz last since his zone out sucks.  Do check out at least one dragon’s lair while you’re there, and I would suggest it be Xygoz’s lair (his is the best!)<br>

<br>
If you were &quot;born&quot; in Luclin era or later, I'm not sure you'll &quot;get&quot; VP even if you go.  If, however, you remember aspriring to a full suit of kunark armor... if you remember Gorenaire being a hard mob to kill... if you remember when &quot;uber&quot; was rubicite and yaks... if you sat there in the Karanas medding (we used to have to do that a lot) and doing /who 40 50 all and seeing the big kids gathering to try Vox yet again... this is something that will resonate.  It's someplace in game that many of us thought we'd never see and being able to just go look and be reasonably safe while doing so is fun.<br>
<br>
Of course, while you're doing it, you have to imagine that you're in maybe-full Kunark armor and when you kill those dragons in VP, look at the crap that they drop and recognize that this was to-die-for loot in its day.  Just look at the weapon ratios and think about how very difficult it was for the first people to kill these mobs.  That's something that we really can't grasp - the levels, the AA, the gear makes this a joke now but in its day it was so very, very hard and the risk in just being there was extreme. <p><p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=365770> <center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/latuttle/harmsig2.jpg"></center> </img> </a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub147.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viante>viante</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#330000>(4/9/04 12:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallontour.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=304.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tourism in Veeshan's Peak for Your Amusement</span><hr size=1> Too bad VP is being revamped again and this guide will be outdated =/ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub147.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwenwyvar>Gwenwyvar</A></span><br> Posts: 35<br> <font color=#330000>(4/9/04 2:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallontour.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=304.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tourism in Veeshan's Peak for Your Amusement</span><hr size=1> What Harmonae said!<br>
