I do don’t care if anyone agrees with this nor desire any feedback on it. I just wanted to post my thoughts on what I personally feel needs to be addressed without it being buried in some other thread.<br>
<br>
A bit of history on myself. I have played EQ since almost the start and the Pinene toon is over 6 years old now. I have seen everything and I feel I know just about all there is aboot the bard class.<br>
<br>
1. Instruments<br>
We need a reason to use them more often. IMHO bards should be using instruments 90% of the time. To do that an instrument needs to be more then just a raw mod. Maybe they should do more then just add a 3.4 mod to a song. Examples of what an instrument could add to a song are; an extra tick to song duration, increased song casting speed, reduced resist rates or increased range.  Give me a reason to use a horns, lutes, and flutes <br>
<br>
2. Song ideas<br>
As mentioned for 60 levels songs were extremely diverse and reflected the idea &quot;jack of all trades master of none&quot;. However, the last 3 years have showed a series of songs that reflect &quot;master of DS, over haste/nuke and resists and jack shit of anything else&quot;. We have lines of old songs that can be looked into for upgrades; the Nivs line and the Largos Line.<br>
<br>
3. Fleet of Foot<br>
Really by now it should affect the entire group like it says<br>
<br>
4. AE dot songs and the nerf<br>
I fully understand the need to address this issue. Due to wide spread use and asshole bards just hogging entire zones causing grief for other soloers and groups. I don’t blame anyone but us for the way AE dots work now. However, it’s broken a few things on how AE songs work. Two prime examples are; if a mob is fleeing due to being low life then no damage is done, Song of Midnight is described as &quot;Decrease Hit points by 8 (L56) to 9 (L70) per tick&quot; on Lucy. Now I know this song probably isn’t used all that much but a part of it is broken I don’t like broken. A couple &quot;IF&quot; statements in the code should be able to resolve both issues.<br>
<br>
5. Song Lands/Fades<br>
This was talked aboot at the last FF and I really hope it's looked in to finally.<br>
<br>
6. Fun<br>
I think I can say that most bards really don’t want more &quot;power per say&quot; (some extra melee output would be nice), but what we want is fun, fun songs, fun clickies, fun illusions, fun instruments. I log on to my bard cause I want to have fun not to play the same 3 or 4 song for 5 hours.<br>
<br>
7. Instrument Cap<br>
It was said this would be raised to something that wouldn't hinder increased mod effects but has yet to happen. It would be a start to item number 1.<br>
<br>
8. Defensive ability<br>
It is fairly easy to say bards are as much of a pulling class as a monk. Due to this roll we are more often then not the recipient of the Rampage effects of raid mobs. Even when not pulling area effect songs put us very high on the rampage list as its built. Now a simple FM will make you all safe and drop you to the bottom of the Rampage list but this could mean a cleric might be next on the list and a few seconds later is dead. Shield of Notes has helped a lot. But I feel deftdance could use a lower recycle time or some more benefit from our plate armor would also be appropriate.<br>
<br>
9. Puretone<br>
Puretone itself should be allowed to be used at a lower level. It is not as useful as it once was at level 60. A new disc should be introduced to allow for some increased functionality. One idea i like the most is make Puretone (or any upgrade disc) not only make all songs play at a minimal mod but also increase the mod a song is being played at by .5. An example; you are holding your drum that does 3.0 mod to your chant and use Puretone instead of doing nothing it would increase your over all mod for the chant to 3.5 as well supplying a 2.5 mod to all other songs you might be playing. In the case of a newer Puretone disc the base mod would be higher and the &quot;bonus&quot; mod would be greater too.  This, again, would be a start to helping item 1.<br>
<br>
10. Bard Melee<br>
If a bard chooses to use melee weapons over an instrument then the damage out put should reflect the loss in power of the songs. Most high end bards are averaging around 200dps and this, in comparison to most other classes, is pretty low at that stage in the game.<br>

Couple of points tho..<br>
<br>
The songs fades as it lands was brought up as you said, along with a couple of other sync issues.  After what I heard both in summit and at faire dont expect this fixed.  It sounds like its more of a web issue then a game issue.  As in, the time it takes for the server to receive the information that you started your song.  So if we all played in San Diego attached to SOE's servers, this wouldnt exist.  They are working on it, but this is a very difficult process since they cant just make all those calculations server-side.  And to be blunt, I do not intend to have this even be an option on the new poll.  I dont feel that it taking up space on our top 10 is worthwhile since I have been assured it is being worked on, but is an almost impossible fix.  And its not just us it effects, nor is it just spells.<br>
<br>
FoF-crap, I forgot to ask about that.  I'll look into it.<br>
<br>
Puretone-Didnt I bring that up?  I honestly dont remember.  However, disciplines for hybrids were brought up a few times.  Let me check my notes and figure out what they said.<br>
<br>
Thanks Pin!<br>

<br>
1. I completely agree that the role of the instrument-weilding bard has all but disappeared from EQ today.  I think that if we ever want to see anything like that happen tho, we're going to have to limit our suggestions to things that are relatively easy to code.  I think duration and song haste are<br>
pretty much out of the question for the standard 3 tick songs.  We could possibly get them to extend the duration of songs that already last longer than 3 ticks, since there must already be a line of code or two devoted to it.<br>
<br>
There's gonna be a lot of issues tho because I don't think there currently is any distinction in the code between a worn instrument mod, and a truely weilded instrument.  It is kind of ironic that by embracing the worn instrument mod on items, bards are now feeling the other edge of the blade by having the options of the true instrument weilder severely limited.<br>
<br>
There is always the possibility of adding an extra flag to true instruments and then add components to song with true instruments as regeants.  For example, a song could<br>
grant the regular hasteV1/str/atk/DS if sung with no instrument; a mod'ed version of those stats with a worn instrument mod; but if sung with a true instrument, would<br>
add 5 to accuracy, mod'ed to a possibly 20 accuracy depending on the power of the instrument.  Unfortunately, that requires work, and attention to a class no one plays.<br>
<br>
2.  It's so sad how most of us can probably just look at the song list from lvl 1 to 60, and come up with a whole new line up of songs for bards for the next expansion that will be a million times better than what we'll get.  In 15 minutes at that.<br>
<br>
3.  I don't think I would want that as top 10.  Makes it seem like we have nothing to complain about and we're reaching.  It's a coding bug and they won't fix it.<br>
<br>
4.  The devs are so happy they killed AE kiting that I'm sure they will not consider ever looking at that code again.  And they'll smile while they say no.  It did take them 3 tries afterall, that's a lot of work!<br>
<br>
5.  Same as number 3.<br>
<br>
6.  A lot of classes would say &quot;I would settle for 4 different spells to cast, i'm stuck with 2&quot;.  It's too similar to point #2 and &quot;fun&quot; probably means different things to different people.  RandomDev_01 says &quot;Royal Rumbles are teh funnest GM events ever!&quot;.  I think emphasising song variety is more important.  Let's get the devs to focus on songs lvl 1-60 and not 61-65 when they want to upgrade stuff.  Especially since the next expansion will not raise levels.<br>
<br>
7.  Unfortunately the raising of the instrument mod cap was part of the &quot;re-envisioning&quot;, and that's all over and done with.  Sony already moved the P.R. and marketing towards the next expansion so they won't respond to anything that was talked about in the re-envisioning anymore.  Sorry.<br>
<br>
8.  I liked how monks got their AC un-nerfed, got dodge-from-behind, and other things to help with pulling.<br>
A bard is a puller.  I like how wars,sk's, and pallies got a<br>
boost in AC because they were plate class.  A bard is a plate class.  WTF?  The more I look at it the more I think Sony works like a merrit guild (no offense to the 1% of the merrit guilds out there that actually work).<br>
<br>
9.  We might get puretone 2.0 at some point.  Probably the day after it becomes useless for some reason or another.<br>
<br>
10.  The problem with bard melee dps is that when the devs look at potential dps of classes when they are balancing them, they really go for the god-mode scenario.  This means a bard with max atk and all buffs, with another bard in the group singing battle songs, while playing dot songs and clicking in drums for max mod damage.  They can't separate melee dps from overall dps, from a balance perspective.  It's a raw deal for our pitiful melee dps, but in the overall dps department, we're kinda flying under the radar at the moment and in my opinion should not attempt to bring attention to it.<br>
<br>
Those are my thoughts,<br>
I like feedback, goes well with coffee in the morning.<br>

10. The problem with bard melee dps is that when the devs look at potential dps of classes when they are balancing them, they really go for the god-mode scenario. This means a bard with max atk and all buffs, with another bard in the group singing battle songs, while playing dot songs and clicking in drums for max mod damage. They can't separate melee dps from overall dps, from a balance perspective. It's a raw deal for our pitiful melee dps, but in the overall dps department, we're kinda flying under the radar at the moment and in my opinion should not attempt to bring attention to it.<br>

Ummmmm, right.  Cause players actually code the game, right?  Ooooo thats right, Sylfia was the one that changed the new epics to 1hs, right?  And we're all complaining to Liq about Staunch Recovery and begging Jyve to change the click on Speaker of the Scale?<br>
Players can know and understand the basic numbers, but they have no idea whatsoever how the game is actually writen unless a dev, like Zajeer, tells them, or they worked on the code in the past (in which case they are bound by legal agreement not to discuss it anyhow).  Which is exactly what he did in that post.  To think players know more about game code then Devs is ignorant.  And dont bring up the EQEmu servers either, those people create their own code based on the EQ Client, its not the developer code that SOE actually works on.<br>
<br>
As for the reenvisionment thing, believe what you want, I dont care.  Its still going on and there are still things coming in the near future under its title.   <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jarethsun/ctvsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Heh under normal raid conditions you are fully buffed with maximized potential due to having the best buffs. In a pickup group you are lucky if you get half those buffs. I seriously doubt you are going to be outdamaging alot of groups unless you are comparing a raid geared person grouped with bazaar geared players. In which case thats not really a good comparison. DPS is DPS across the board, situations like ranged fights will create different dps as will varying ae's and such to knock everyone down a peg. You take your group in a raid onto a DoN mission and you will get out DPS'ed just as much there if not more than you were on the raid due to lower AC/mitigating/etc mobs. <br>
