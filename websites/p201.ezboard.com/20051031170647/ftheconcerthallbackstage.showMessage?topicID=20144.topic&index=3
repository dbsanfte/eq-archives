Songs fade as it lands, this is a synchronization issue (40 mins on tape), they are making improvements to the synchronization between the client and the server, and have tried to switch the sync to the server side, but that caused major problems. They will be working on it, but there is no ETA.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This annoys the hell out of me and I seriously hope they fix it. At least they are aware of it. Messing with the server/client sync is likely going to have widespread effects that I doubt they will push live without extensive testing. ETA 6months+ imo. <br>

Bard Snare, Rytan said he would take a look at the new snare and see about putting a resist mod in.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I thought the request here was to have it be a fixed duration? As I understand it even though I have rarely if ever used it was that Dirge of Metala was a random length of time that it would last? Basically I have stuck to the lower level snares just because they have always been somewhat reliable. <br>

I spoke to him about Staunch Recovery and came away from this meeting feeling good about the conversation.

Corpse summoners and death penalties were discussed and the general consensus was that there needs to be a penalty. In the other games you don’t get as attached to your character since you don’t have those moments of fear trying to get your corpse. Fear breaks, naked runs across KoS zones, etc all to get your corpse back brought people more to their characters and I would tend to agree.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The penalty is that if you raid goes to the guild lobby its basically over for the raid. The penalty is that you have rez effects. The penalty is that it cost you 200pp. If there was a pendant you could buy to give you a 100% exp rez in addition to the corpse summon pendant I would say that might be a bit much. The real risk is that your raid might wipe and have to use the lobby. Usually when we use the lobby the raid is over, otherwise we are figuring out another way to get corpses rezed. I disagree that there needs to be some penalty added to using this feature of the game. Its working fine the way it is just leave it alone.<br>

The idea was brought up to drag-and-drop buffs inside the buff window, but there was no feedback on that idea. The short-term buff box was brought up with the ideas of more spells going there, but they don’t want to change many spells to go in that window since that is part of balancing encounters when you have to work around X many buffs.<br>

<br>
Wasn't it mentioned that if the short duration buff window filled up the buffs would go into the main buff window originally? Well the other day just messing around with another bard in group and had a full short duration buff window and I know I was playing a song that stacked but it wasn't going anywhere. Did something change or did I imagine that I heard that? Or have other people seen buffs bump from one window to the other window? Maybe bump the SDB window to 8 buffs if they consider adding more things to go to that window.<br>

It would be nice to get this into a twistable format on certain encounters where certain songs are bad and ae's going off frequently. I would probably ask that this get bumped up in dmg absorption though cause at 450dmg thats like 1/4 of what the trash in Anguish hits for. Double the dmg and make it fit into a 4-song twist. That would at least make me think about mem'ing it.<br>

I am suprised that our defensive skills in relation to the recent pal/sk/monk upgrades wasn't brought up. The fact that a ranger, in chain, with less defensive aa, with less AC, can hold aggro and tank better is enough me make me upchuck my cookies. <br>

*something Mojo brought up on the SoE boards I thought would have been asked*<br>
5) Total lack of creativity with new bard songs! Nearly our entire OoW song set was nothing more then a scaled up PoP song set which completly goes against how the bard is set up for the first 60 levels where most songs along our level curve are completly original, and scale up as we level, I would just like some sort of commitment from developers that they plan to keep some level of creativity in the future bard spell lines rather then giving us the same 10 songs every expansion.<br>

Not to pick on Rytan here (he's actually a nice guy who seems to have the patience of a saint), but his comment to me that he really doesn't think Bards need anything right now kind of implies that they really aren't going to make any improvements to our class at all.<br>

There are alot of things I would like to see change but that is the nature of playing a class you care alot about. Knowing the feeling of the devs and people in charge over there would at least set the expectation bar of what is to come. If they really feel that we need nothing then thats what I will expect, nothing. If we get something it will be a suprise. It sure beats the &quot;well maybe&quot; and the &quot;we will look into that&quot; when you know what they really feel.<br>
