To her horror, she sees more green shapes approaching her wielding weapons of some kind.  She struggles even harder to escape to no avail.  Her mind exploding with fear and lack of air, she suddenly remembers that she can breathe if only the fear will abate enough for her to begin humming.  She closes her eyes so that she will not see the fate approaching her, and begins to hum softly.  Immediately her lungs feel filled with air, and the fire that was her body is cooled.  She pauses one more moment before opening her eyes to face her attackers.  <br>
<br>
She opens her eyes to see a mermaid and a siren almost upon her bearing their terrible weap-  Uh - Soap?  And a scrub brush???  Their eyes are full of mischief, and they begin to pull off Mircha's clothes.  She feels the hands holding her relax their grip, and let go, only to grab her waist, and spin her around.  She comes to a stop facing the creature who dragged her down.  She is quite prepared to be furious with her attacker and punish them for this prank, and is glaring when she is faced with a merman.  A merman with a smile that would melt chocolate, and eyes like the purest emerald.  And hands that are no longer gripping her firmly, but gently.  Hands that are touching her bare skin.  Mircha blushes furiously, and drops her eyes, only to raise them again.  She wants to memorize this face so that she can do it justice in a ballad.<br>
<br>
She surrenders herself to their ablutions, and the warmth with which they are given.  Finally, the merman caresses her once more, and lifts her to the shore.  She sits a moment on the shore, lost in remembrance of the very recent past, until the cold of the morning bites into her wet and naked body.  She rises, and swiftly dons her cloak, thankful to have at least one dry item of clothing.  She grabs her backpack, and wraps her wet clothing up in a bundle.  A glint of metal catches her eye, and she picks it up.  It is a codpiece!  What strange things are here, she thinks.  Dropping the metal to the ground, she picks up the wet bundle, and heads away from the pond to find some wood.  She is greatly in need of a fire.<br>

She hobbles over to retrieve her clothes and sees that the stone she kicked is joined by others.  Following the path of stones with her eyes, she slaps her forehead in disbelief.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;A house?!  How did I not see that before?&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Hurrying to the house and mounting the steps to the door, she opens the screen, and knocks firmly on the door.  She does not worry at the early hour, for she is confident of a warm welcome.  She has never been turned away before; as a musician, she is always welcome at a country home where the inhabitants are usually desperate for some form of entertainment.<br>
<br>
A cold gust of winter wind batters her nearly naked form, and she redoubles her efforts to wake the house.  To no avail.  Shivering with cold, she grasps the handle of the door, and opens it slowly.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  &quot;Hallooo?  Anybody home?&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Silence greets her calls, and she enters the kitchen and closes the door behind her.  The house is warmer than the cold outside, but she can still see her breath before her.  It is strange, but it appears to have been left suddenly.  Many chairs are placed around the kitchen, and a pot of water on the stove has a thin sheet of ice crystals on it's surface.  A jar of cocoa and a spoon are nearby, as if the person making the cocoa simply disappeared.  Mircha attempts to ponder these things, but the long night, and her wrestle with the mermaid, the siren, and the merman, have left her utterly exhausted.  <br>
<br>
She drags her tired body into the next room, and her mouth drops.  A handful of pixies are assembled in various uncomfortable looking pixie poses, on a large orange sofa.  There is a coloured light that flashes on them, and a noise coming from the the other side of the room.  She looks warily at the pixies, but they are completely indifferent to her presence.  She moves into the room, and spying a large chair, goes to it, and sinks into it with a grateful sigh.  Curling up into a ball, she pulls her cloak around her, and her eyes droop shut.  The noise is still there, and the lights flash behind her eyes.  The noise is language of some kind, and she hears the words</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;Bill Nye...science guy...&quot;. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Must be a poem, she thinks, and starts to hum softly to herself.  Half-asleep, she is unaware of the tune she is humming, or of the tear that falls from her eye on her way into slumber at last.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
