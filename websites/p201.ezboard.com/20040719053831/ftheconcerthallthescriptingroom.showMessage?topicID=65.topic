<br>
A name. It always begins with anything but a name, but at this time, it's about all I have to cling to that I know isn't just another lost memory.<br>
<br>
I woke up to find myself laying in the sewers of a city, ragged clothes wrapped around my aching body, shackles and cuffs around my neck, wrists and ankles. I cried out, but found my voice faltered, and felt the sting of tears in my eyes from all that was unknown to me.<br>
<br>
As time passed, the chill of the waters there kept me awake, kept me alert, and kept me afraid. I tried to strain to see deeper into the tunnels, but it was always so dark...<br>
<br>
Drifting in and out of sleep I would catch myself remembering a faint tune...Nothing too fancy, just something soft and comforting...Something very familiar to me. What I didn't realize is that my voice was slowly coming back to me and that over a period of time that seemed like days I would be singing to myself, no words to my song, just hollow notes echoing down the sewers pipes to places I thought I would never see.<br>
<br>
One day, when I believed my life to be at end closer then any other I swore I heard a splash, louder then the ones the rats made that often would crawl over me in my sleeping. I sat up quickly, and felt my body light afire with a pain that was almost too much to take, my body sinking back against the wall, and sliding under the water.<br>
<br>
The next thing I remember is a voice, gruff and harsh, shouting, paining my ears, then hands, burning, stinging hands pulling me up and out of the cold waters, my eyes straining to open, pushing back more acid tears, but then all went black and it was cold again.<br>
<br>
My eyes soon opened, upon hearing the same voice, barking out orders as I was blinded by so much light. Light! I wasn't in the sewers anymore, but in a bed! I tried to move, but again pain riveted through my body and I was forced to stay laying down, blinking, trying to focus on my surroundings.<br>
<br>
I then heard a woman's voice, soft and gentle start to coo nearby, and soon realized she was sitting beside me, my eyes focusing on a soft face, one of blue eyes and blonde hair, such an image to be given after the rats and sewers gave her an angelic appearance, and I swore I would have cried out. Apparently, I had, for she had jumped from her chair, toppling it over and shouting over and over &quot;Leansi is awake! She's awake!&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leansi?&quot; I thought to myself...Is that me? Is she calling me Leansi?<br>
<br>
I heard a thunder of footsteps come my way, and I turned best I could in their direction, and saw a man, of tall height, pointed ear and palest of skins...A High Elf! I remembered the race almost immediately, and had to smile to myself when he spoke, finding that he, this elegant and beautiful man was the very one who held the gruff and harsh voice. About his figure was a robe of the deepest violet...Violet, I remember the violets I used to pick...The scent of violets filled my senses for a momment, and the memory fades almost as instantly as the light.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wake up!&quot; Followed by a stinging slap to my cheek, my eyes flicker open, back to seeing the High Elf. &quot;Leansi? You need to wake up. You need to get some food into you Young Lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
I must have just stared at him for a few momments, still unsure if he meant me to be 'Leansi', and then, he sat down on the edge of the bed, helping me to sit up.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Duloran. The woman who was nursing your wounds, that is Galiaya. We found you in the sewers day before yester'. I could have sworn I heard singing, Galiaya thought my age was getting the better of me, but I insisted we go down, and that is where we found you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I nodded to his words, and managed to smile, painfully, and tried to speak, finding my voice groggy and my mouth unwilling to move in the proper shapes, so the only thing produced was a whimper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hush now,&quot; Duloran spoke, &quot;you are worn and weary, any fool could see that. We managed to track down a Rogue to remove the shackles, he had quite the time fumbling with those lock picks of his, but he's good at what he does.&quot; At this Duloran chuckled to himself, then continued. &quot;On the one that was around your neck, there were some writings, I was lucky in my training in languages and was able to deceipher the name in the script, 'Leansi'. We would assume that is you, since you were the one who wore it. It's not uncommon for one to write the name of a slave or prisoner on their collar so that others know the name of one they wish to order about.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this I gasped and cringed back a bit, but he lay a hand on my shoulder, and I waited for the burning to begin again, but it did not...<br>
<br>
&quot;No worries Young Lady, no one means to have you do anything you are not hap' to do of your own accord. All we wish to do, Galiaya &amp; I, is to make sure you recover and are well.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this Duloran smiled, placed a hand to my left cheek, his thumb going over a spot under my eye a few times, before he stood, bowed his head, pardoned himself and left.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leansi...&quot; I murmered to myself, then sank back down under the covers, Galiaya helping me again. Soon I drifted to sleep, and dreams of violets came... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.showPrevMessage?topicID=65.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.showNextMessage?topicID=65.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.emailToFriend?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.threadControl?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p201.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theconcerthallbackstage">Backstage<option value="theconcerthallcenterstage">Center Stage<option value="theconcerthallontour">On Tour<option value="theconcerthallthecriticschair">The Critics Chair<option value="theconcerthallstageleft">Stage Left<option value="theconcerthallfrm9">The Voting Booth<option value="theconcerthallfrm7">The Adventurer's Tavern<option value="theconcerthallthescriptingroom">The Scripting Room<option value="theconcerthallthegiftshoppe">The Gift Shoppe<option value="theconcerthallfrm8">The Hall of Fame<option value="theconcerthallfrm12">User Interfaces<option value="theconcerthallfrm11">Admin<option value="theconcerthallfrm13">Thread Trash Bin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall>The Concert Hall - Message Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom>The Scripting Room</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31p<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
