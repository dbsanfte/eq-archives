My mother, a ranger of the Faydark's Champions. While they no doubt loved me, I'm sure, their lives of adventure left them little time to raise me. I spent most of my time in the company of the Songweavers, who taught their craft, and introduced me to the life of a bard. But most of my friends were from various rogue's guilds across Faydwer. It was they who first told me of the god Bristlebane, and taught me some of their best pranks.<br>
<br>
The Songweavers tolerated my antics, and often had to hide their amusement at them. I remember one of my favorite tricks I pulled; there was an artist who was stopping through Kelethin looking to paint a landscape of the Faydark. He asked that I show him a scenic place, and I did so. After he was finished, he showed me his work: and it was breathtaking. A perfect reproduction of the forest beyond. <br>
<br>
Now,this particular artist also had quite a penchant to drink, and he asked me to show him to one of the taverns in Kelethin. A few bottles of elven wine later, I managed to convince this artist also to let slip his secret: an enchanted paintbrush that would turn his canvas into a perfect image of whatever lay behind it. Trying to stifle the smile spreading across my face, I told him that he should probably set up kip in an inn for the night. Not in a state to disagree, I showed him the way, and waited till he fell asleep. Then, I had no difficulty finding his brush in his bags, and crept out at night, and went to work on one of the greatest practical jokes to ever be played. Bristlebane was made proud that night, indeed. <br>
<br>
The next morning, all of Kelethin awoke to be terrified of what they saw: all of the bridges connecting the platforms of this tree city had vanished! The soldiers of Tunare and the Faydark's Champions immediately suspected some dark form of sorcery that Teir'Dal saboteurs must have performed, as a prelude to an orc invasion from Crushbone. They called forth for magicians and enchanters from Felwithe to aid them in reversing the dark magic, to no avail. It seemed that spells designed to bring the bridges back into existence wouldn't work, and the fear grew. What they didn't realise, is that the reason the bridges couldn't be brought back to their original positions, was because they were never gone. Having been painted over by a mischievous bard the night before, to make the bridges look exactly like the forest floor below.<br>
<br>
Oh, but all great hoaxes run the risk of being uncovered, and no doubt this one would be as well. With the guards of Kelethin on high alert, the rest of Kelethin went to work to rebuild the bridges with stores of wood gathered from dead trees. (Elves of course, only using wood from trees already dead, feeling it a crime against Tunare to kill them themselves) When they proceeded to put the boards into place, there was something blocking the way. Upon closer inspection, they found the problem, and scraped the seemingly solid air with a dagger, only to find wood beneath and intact. Well, with this discovery, the mages of Kelethin knew a simple magick to reverse the effects of the enchanted paint. And in a matter of minutes, the bridges were all returned to normal. <br>
<br>
Well, no doubt all the elves of the Faydark were outraged, and a search of the entire city was ordered. When they checked the inns, they found the enchanted brush in its original home in the artist's pack. He was immediately placed under arrest. I never intended to get anyone into trouble but myself, so I intended to confess to the act once the rage had died down. Surely he would be fine in the meantime. <br>
<br>
At his trial, however, it became clear that he suspected me from the moment the brush was discovered. His argument made all too much sense- he argued that the brush must've been taken in the night, as he would never do such a thing. After all, the incident had uncovered him as a fraud, something no one would do if they could avoid it. When asked who else knew of the brush, he immediately named me. Apparently, while his judgement was impared while drunk, his memory certainly was not. <br>
<br>
Having been in trouble before, (but not to this degree) the elves were certainly not going to doubt this entirely. They asked me if I knew anything about the incident. My first instinct was to deny it, but thinking about what future sentence might be assigned to this artist, I couldn't bring myself to do it. So, I admitted that it had been me. But I was not greeted with very many understanding faces when I told the magistrates of Felwithe that they had to admit it was very funny. Because they certainly didn't think it was so.<br>
<br>
I've always been a very charismatic person, but it took all the silver in my tongue to manage my way out of a prison sentence. When they asked why they shouldn't banish me from the elven cities forever, I summoned forth the very best arguement I could fathom. <br>
<br>
I reasoned that there had been no actual harm done besides scaring them into increasing their guard of the cities against the orcs, which is never a bad thing. I begged them that if they could think of any other examples of harm that I had caused, to please imprison me immediately. Even the Royal Felwithe Prosecuting Advocate, an individual normally quite actively pursuing ways to find troublemakers guilty of crimes for which he could punish them, was at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
So, they agreed that they coudn't imprison me for what I had done. But I was not to go completely free, my instruments and all my posessions (admittedly mostly thieving tools) were confiscated until I had fulfilled the punishment I did receive- which was six months of duty scrubbing the platforms of the entire city clean. A task by no means enjoyable, as they are usually stained with all manner of gunk that is an indirect result of the town's numerous taverns and frequent visitors.<br>
<br>
Still, thinking back, I don't even think much of the punishment. All I can think of is the time I spent hiding in inns with my cap over my mouth, so as to keep the townsfolk form hearing my laughter at the looks on their faces on that beautiful Autumn morning. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dajabovimeti>Dajabo Vimeti</A> at: 7/13/01 11:19:09 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.showPrevMessage?topicID=98.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br><a self href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.emailToFriend?topicID=98.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.threadControl?topicID=98.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=98.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=98.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p201.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theconcerthallbackstage">Backstage<option value="theconcerthallcenterstage">Center Stage<option value="theconcerthallontour">On Tour<option value="theconcerthallthecriticschair">The Critics Chair<option value="theconcerthallstageleft">Stage Left<option value="theconcerthallfrm9">The Voting Booth<option value="theconcerthallfrm7">The Adventurer's Tavern<option value="theconcerthallthescriptingroom">The Scripting Room<option value="theconcerthallthegiftshoppe">The Gift Shoppe<option value="theconcerthallfrm8">The Hall of Fame<option value="theconcerthallfrm12">User Interfaces<option value="theconcerthallfrm11">Admin<option value="theconcerthallfrm13">Thread Trash Bin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall>The Concert Hall - Message Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallthescriptingroom>The Scripting Room</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31p<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
