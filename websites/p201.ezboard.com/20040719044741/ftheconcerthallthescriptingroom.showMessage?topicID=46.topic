She tilted her head and listened to the silence... almost stifling in it's completness.  Throwing back the light furs that formed her summer blanket, she slid from her bed and glanced out the window at the all but empty grounds.<br>
<br>
With a slight frown she turned and walked down the stairs... flipping on the open sign and propping open the door.  The cool, damp air enveloped her as she stepped onto the porch...  Fingers of mist rising from the ground to dance around her as she walked along the path.<br>
<br>
She studied the ground as she walked, almost as if searching for something... and at last, finding it, she stepped off the well worn path and wandered into the woods along a barely seen trail.<br>
<br>
Here, the silence was broken by the gnetly gurgling of a brook... and somewhere in the distance was the muted rumble of a waterfall.  The ground beneath her feet rose slowly, yet constantly... the trees thinning around her until at last they gave way to a tiny field of wildflowers.  She reached out her hands to part the waist high blooms, pushing her way through them to the edge of the field... a field which very suddenly broke away into thin air.<br>
<br>
Looking down from this place, she could take in all the grounds of the haven.  The house in the center... the barn... the pond... the path that led to town.  And still, nothing stirred below.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>

Sunlight streamed in through a round window, spiliing into the room with a mystic cadence... as if a seraphim were about to glide down the beams with a herald of fluttering french horns to greet Gaelim personally with an account of the Sun God's rising once again from death. She was lifted from lingering dreams by a surge of joy and a gushing exuberance!<br>
&lt;I am born now&gt; she thinks &lt;just as I am born anew with every breath... there is no restriction that I do not place with my own hand...&gt;<br>
Smiling she gets up, disturbing a fine white short-hair cat that was snoozing in the crook of her legs.<br>
&quot;Well hello, handsome!&quot; She spoils him with much petting as he gazes up at her with heavy-lidded eyes of bliss. &lt;I suppose I am still at Liani's&gt; she thinks, looking about the room... simple, clean, many plants, a statue of a naked young man holding a spear (!), a water basin and mirror... very peaceful and cozy! She gets out of bed and stretches to and fro... peeking at herself in the mirror occasionally.<br>
&lt;I wonder how long I slept? The scratched on my face are gone... &gt; She begins to rumage around the room looking for something simple to wear, not wanting to get back into the dirty clothes from her previous adventure. &lt;I wonder if anyone discovered what that bronze cube is for? I never did get to explain where I found it...&gt; All she comes up with is a pair of bear-skin under garments, thick with fluffy brown fur...<br>
&quot;By Tunare, what goes on in this room when the weary are not resting? Methinks they fit!&quot; Indeed they do, and Gaelim spends a few minutes posing in front of the mirror, pushing her breasts up and scowling like a barbarian, until she bursts out laughing... which she cuts off when she hears someone outside her door... frozen for a second in the middle of the room in a Barberella bikini... then she leaps into the bed and dives under the covers! &lt;Pretend to be asleep!&gt;<br>
After a minute she realizes that the sound is not coming from the hallway door, but the wall by the trunk of clothes... slowly she creeps over to the spot and hears a scratching and mewling... &lt;another cat behind this wall!&gt; She looks around for whitey but can't see him.<br>
&quot;Well, let's see here...&quot; She begins pushing back and forth on the wall, twinking knotholes and such, attempting to find a means of opening. Finally there is a satisfying click when she makes to adjust the statue's spear a bit... out from the opening in the wall walks the white cat that was previously asleep on her legs! <br>
&quot;Hey! How did you get in there, mister?&quot; She peers into the dark hallway as the cat bumps his head against her legs. A curving stairwell down... with a very vague scent of patchuli and govinda and... something else... wafting into the room. &lt;What kind of tricks has Liani built into this house of hers?&gt;<br>
Gaelim, with growing excitement, starts to move her way into the stairwell... &lt;What's that? A faint bluegreen glow from below? And that? Was that the distant sound of a bewitching baliset string twanging the air like a seductress?&gt; She crept forward down the stairs and out of sight, following the white blur of the cat in front of her...<br>
Behind her the false door slowly swung shut with a soft click. <br>

Between her and the cat, enough heat radiation was given off to cast her descent in a ruddy haze, alowing for sure placement of feet, as well as highlighting the bluegreen lambence that was coming from below. The echoes of the sultry baliset became more defined, hints of melancholy... a touch of humor... but always sensual.<br>
At the bottom was a circular room filled with ornate carpets and lounge pillows, small tables with wine and dates, tapestries on the walls with complex colors that defied definition in the shadowy haze of the place, in which also drifted lazy insense smoke. It was the torches along the walls that emitted the watery hue, giving the space a close and undersea aura.<br>
In the midst of this was a man standing, with one foot propped on a couch, playing the baliset with his eyes closed. His clothing was simple, dark and loose, yet of rich materials. It seemed as if he didn't notice her entrance to the room as he kept playing on... but then he stopped and turned to her with casual regard.<br>
&quot;Hello, young lady! I thought to be alone tonight... and so you've heard a song that no one else has heard in a very long time...&quot; He smiled &quot;Come, my dear, never am I so consumed with memories that I will pass on an evening in the gracious company of a beautiful lady such as thee... will you not chance this poor wine and paltry table of modest fare? I crave to hear your tale... and any others you have heard which bring a smile to your lips!&quot; <br>
He was an older gentleman, vibrant looking and handsome still, with penetrating hazel eyes that were never invasive. Gaelim told him many of her favorite stories, including her own, and was finally prompted after some wine to sing, which so delighted him that he picked up the tempo and fashioned a jig to it and danced merrily around the room! Then he told some of his own tale, about a time spent on ships as the bard of a group of philosophical pirates, of the strange places they went and the perils that sometimes claimed the lives of friends. These memories made his eyes grow wistful so Gaelim then prodded him the sing for her, which he complied with a small epic, full of love and pride, passion and vanity, death and wonder. Gaelim became lost in the river of his song as it flowed forth... his voice was the poetry of elemental vitality... she felt like she was made of bubbling light.<br>
After this performance, as he closed his eyes and sighed deeply, she walked over to him and kissed him on his lips, which startled him.<br>
Then Gaelim heard footsteps from the stairs and turned to see Liani come into the room. &lt;laughing happily and bounding over to Liani in her bearfur underclothes&gt;<br>
&quot;Oh, High Lady! I've just met your distinguished other guest here... mister... ah... &quot; Frowning she turns toward the gentleman she has been having such a merry time with... &quot;You know, I never did get you na...&quot;<br>
He was gone. Everything in the room was gone, replaced with cold stone floors and cobwebs stretched in the corners and over a few old boxes and trunks, hinges rusted. The abrupt change, as well as Liani staring at her, caused a wave of dizziness to fizzle through Gaelim's head and she had to crouch down on the floor. &lt;I can still smell him... my fingers and toes are still tingling from his song... what happened here?&gt;<br>
As Gaelim stood back up unsteadily, she noticed a particular shape in the corner, covered in dust and cobwebs... an instrument case. Pulled to it, she tries to open it, instead the lid rips off in mouldering decay... inside is an beautiful ancient baliset, precious woods cracked and discolored with age, though smouldering even still with a palpible psychic residue of ages past and glories remembered in spirit alone.<br>
&quot;Gosh...&quot; murmurs Gaelim as she brings the baliset over to Liani, her eyes wide with awe and shock and bewilderment... <br>
and eventually, a wistful smile.<br>
