<br>
There is a string of quests that are strung togather here (kind of like the dwarves ring/shawl quests)<br>
<br>
Quest 1:  Citizenship quest.<br>
<br>
Quest 2: training<br>
<br>
Quest 3: Drum<br>
<br>
Quest 1 has you running around visiting several people within the City and when completed you have a tablet that is your ID card so to speak.<br>
<br>
Quest 3:  This quest you get after being sent to &lt;**insert name when I get it**&gt; and he asks for 3 scorpion husks.  these are no drop and drop off scorpions in the &quot;Pit&quot;<br>
<br>
When you return them, he gives you a mortor and asks that you fill it and make a bowl while he makes you a shield from the scorpion husks.  <br>
<br>
Step 1: Combine 4 &lt;**Insert name here**&gt; femers and hit combine to get powder.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Combine powder, flask of water and Xakra bile (Found on Xakra worm larve) and hit combine.<br>
<br>
(Note: Step one and two does not appear to check any skill)<br>
<br>
Step 3:  Combine Clay (made in step 2), Flask of water, and bowl sketch given by &lt;&lt;*name*&gt;&gt; to get unfired bowl of &lt;&lt;*name*&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Return the bowl to him and he gives you the next quest as well as returning the bowl.<br>
<br>
He requests:  Finished bowl<br>
                   Iniate's cloak (from citizenship quest)<br>
                   Leather cord<br>
                   Streached Hopper Hide (Side quest)<br>
<br>
To get the streached hopper hide goto Broker &lt;*name*&gt; and give him your slate and he will give you a bad to fill with 4 young hopper skins.<br>
<br>
This is as far as I have gotten and will update as I progress or others add info to this.<br>

Gherik is the pottery guy that gives the sketch, and the bowl is the Unfired Bowl of Jharin.<br>

Once you've done the young hopper hide collection, you hand that combined bag of hopper hides back to Broker Fahaar (just before entering the castle courtyard). He gives you the Stretched Hopper Hide and the Leather Cord (both no-drop).<br>

He then tells you he cannot continue your training, and that you should take your buckler and show it to Hymnist Gawfed. This is kind of bugged, because you can sit there and hand him your buckler over and over and get exp.<br>
Once you've handed him your buckler (a couple hundred times) he says...<br>
<br>
Hymnist Gawfed says 'Very well met, young friend.  I assume that Gherik has sent you to me for the purpose of training you.  Unforunately, I will not be doing any formal training for the several days.  I'm taking a bit of a holiday to celebrate my wife's birthday.  If you could take this receipt to the merchant for me before my wife gets home, I'd appreciate it.  I'll place you at the top of my training list as well.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what merchant?'<br>
<br>
Hymnist Gawfed says 'Gah... I'm losing my wits.  I didn't tell you which merchant.  Well, the fur is the first thing to go, and the mind is a close second.  My wife's birthday is usually quite a large event in my household and I've been trying to make this one extra special.  I'm lucky I can still find my tail.  Take the note to Jihli Mahej.  He's an importer who lives near the... gah!  I can't remember the address.  I'm sure you'll find him though.  Good luck!<br>
<br>
I looked all over Shar Vahl, didn't find Jihli Mahej anywhere. I didn't look outside, and I really don't even know if there are merchants out there.<br>
<br>
So far this is an excellent newbie quest, with the items really being worth the effort. Hell, the +1 Pottery cloak is cool enough to do this quest! The Drum is nice, considering they don't sell drums in Shar, and the Buckler is pretty sweet with it's poison resistance. All the scorpians and some hoppers poison you while fighting.<br>
<br>
I'm still looking for Jihli Mahej, so if any of you stumble across him, post it here please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Jihli Mahej looks at the note and begins to look a bit nervous. 'The vase that Master Gawfed purchased was accidentally knocked off of the shelf last night by a most clumsy customer.  I apologize greatly, but I have only the broken pieces of the vase to offer you.  Here, please take them with my sincere apologies.  I will give Master Gawfed house credit for the vase and I can recommend someone that may be able to assist you in this most unfortunate dilemma. Give the pieces to Chogar and he may be able to assist you in repairing the vase.<br>
<br>
He gives you the no-drop vase pieces, and you hunt down Chogar. He's sitting with a bleck female at the end of one of the merchant districts. Give him the pieces gets you:<br>
<br>
Chogar says 'I can do nothing to repair this mess, but a skilled potter like you should be able to create a new one with little trouble.  One second please, I'll jot a rough sketch of the what I surmise the original looked like when it was intact.  You can take the sketch and make a new one.  It will require of you a medium sized block of clay, a little water, and this sketch.  Here you go.  The sketch is a little crude, but I am sure that it will suffice. Fire it with a quality firing sheet and give the resulting product to Gawfed. Jihli told me that he was eager to receive it.<br>
<br>
So, take a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Block of Clay</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> + Flask of Water + Vase Sketch = Vase (not trivial at 81 to spin, triv to fire). <br>
<br>
When I was about to take it back to Gawfed I noticed they were taking Shar Vahl down for emergency maintenence. When It came back up, he was gone. I can confirm that they know he was giving exp for the buckler over and over, and he'll be put back in the game when he's fixed (read: no more exp for showing items to npcs).<br>
<br>
I can't wait! I'm working on a walk-through for all you catman bards.

He gives you a new box, and says to collect 7 Owlbear Feathers, combine them in box with the cloak, and then return the box and the cloak to him.<br>
<br>
Note the slight confusion there: it seems you are supposed to combine the cloak inside the box, but after combine you somehow still have the cloak back to give to Gawfed with the combined box.  We'll see.<br>
<br>
Owlbears are in Paradul, Hollowshade and Grimling.  For some reason, something is going on with Hollowshade: when i went there are a level 12 Bard, there were so many Owlbears you couldn't go three steps w/o an add; when i passed through with my SK the next day, there were no Owlbears for a RL hour in the zone. =/  Reports are that they are back this morning.  I don't know if there's a long on/off time, or it has something to do with the zonecrashes.<br>
<br>
I've gotten reports that you find about 1 Feather an hour. =/  People have several Feathers already and i don't, so i doubt i'll be the first on Torv to have the next step.

Once you get them, you combine 7 feathers + your cloak in the bag and return it to gawfed (you are now cloakless as the combine keeps the cloak).  He then tells you the new cloak will be ready soon and you have some more chores to do.  You're then sent to the instrument dude that's standing next to gherik.  This is where it gets tricky and I need some help- I'm 99% sure he told me to fill a bag he gave me with &quot;owlbear guts&quot; because he needs more supplies to make lute strings.  I had saved 5 &quot;owlbear tendons&quot; and I went out to get 3 more (they look like strings so I figured they were the right item).  Unfortunately, after I got the 8 tendons, they did not combine in the bag.  I then collected 8 fatty meats and tried those with no luck.<br>
<br>
So someone pls collect the feathers and turn them in and record what he says about the guts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I can't re-do that part of the quest since I have no cloak at the time being to combine with 7 more feathers.

<br>
If you're on Tholuxe Paells, I have 4 feathers atm that I will give away so that I might see the next set of instructions again.  Send a tell to chemikal or snish- I'm sure I'll have more later.  If I get 7 feathers and no one on tholuxe is there yet, I'll MQ the slate/registrar note with a new char and start all over, cuz I'm to that point of annoyance.<br>
<br>
What I'm afraid of is that I'm right and all he says are &quot;owlbear guts&quot; with no clue about the zone they drop in....  They drop some weird stuff, but I don't believe the bears in paludal or hollowshade are dropping anything like &quot;guts&quot; (besides the tendons I already tried).  I've keeled a rediculous amount of bears in hollowshade, so I really doubt those are the right ones (unless they simply aren't dropping guts like they are supposed to, which was the case with young rockhopper hides at first).<br>
<br>
One mistake I made- I didn't try to ask him any questions about the guts, because I immediately figured they were the tendons that I had seen a bunch of times.  So it's possible I'm sure that you can drag some more info out of him...<br>

<br>
At the moment, you are at a state where you can get further along with the quest, but lose your cloak.  Considering the lack of ability to keep things straight, i see the current situation as a dilemma:<br>
<br>
1) Hand in the feathers now and lose your cloak, and wait for Guts (or whatever replacement) will drop.<br>
<br>
2) Hold onto the Feathers, allowing to wear your cloak, but be forewarned that they may screw up the Feather part of the quest in their 'correction'. <p><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=63179">Spyght Deadnyght, Revenant of Neriak, Eater of Charleston Chews.</A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub5.ezboard.com/usnish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>snish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#330000>(12/14/01 6:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallstageleft.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=338.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kitten quest drum</span><hr size=1> Just to keep this thread alive...<br>

I try to check every day after the patch with my sham by killin off 10-15 bears.  They still aren't roaming around like they used to (pretty much just in the caves now) and aren't dropping guts that I have found.<br>
<br>
Just dinged 27 today and like a complete noob I forgot that charm is a wind based song... so now I get to sit around invis for hours.   In case any of you haven't played a bard up to 26/27, here's some free advice: As soon as you hit lev 19, plan to take 2 nights before you hit 26 to leave your character logged in while you sleep- one night for brass (fear is brass at 26), and the other night for wind.  For brass, ya gotta use DDD (lev 18 song) to practice... so find a real safe place- in the corner of shady's cave in EC for example.  For wind you can just use invis and be pretty much anywhere.  If your skill isn't at least 100 brass/wind by the time you hit 26/27, life suxors... <br>

They didn't combine so I handed them in uncombined.  (mistake) He gave me the bag back empty and said I might need this.  I spent hours killing owlbear cubs for those damn tendons.  At least it sounds like they weren't suppose to be used for the quest.  It seems the cubs spawn very fast, maybe 30 seconds to a minute from the time the one that is up is killed.  Yet there is only one owlbear cub at a time.  The feathers are easy to get off higher lvl owlbears. The cubs rarely drop them.<br>
<br>
Damnit Verant!  I was looking forward to a new cloak!!! What is this with screwing up the quest???<br>
<br>
I am starting to wonder how much verant likes Bards or SKs.  The bard songs were broken when luclin came out, and the sk spell vendor wandered the zone and phased through walls.  Now there are broken quests and songs, and the sk spells stack with nothing making them almost useless.  /sigh<br>
