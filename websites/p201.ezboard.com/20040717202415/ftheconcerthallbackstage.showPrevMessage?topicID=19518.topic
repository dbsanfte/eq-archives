<br>
- Casting Time bar shows 8 secs, but the Song window shows the song icon appearing at 5 sec mental count.  Pros-Con is that I can twist in 5 songs with little problems, the Con is that it gets crazy to keep counting mentally over watching the spell casting bar <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
- Selo (all forms) is broken for me, seems that I am stuck at normal run speed even with Runspeed 5 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   . . . a 100k Drogmar out ran me! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   . . . have already tried logging out and rebooting . . . still same problem.<br>
<br>
I have already did a /bug and /feedback . . . <br>
<br>
<br>
-- EDIT IN --<br>
<br>
Just to clarify, the spellcasting bar counts total 8 secs. Now, in that 8 second bar, on the 5th second, the song icon appears onto the song window (or buff window depending on the song).  The side effect is that before, I can twist 4 songs with one song fading out once in a while . . . Now, I can twist 5 songs with the 5th song fading out once in a while.<br>

It sounds like lag where you cast a song and 5 sec later it starts playing? If that is so it isn't a song bug, just server lag... mainly experianced in zones where you have 100+ people raiding or something. It gets vicious when two raids both engage mobs at the same time.<br>
<br>
As for the selos problem, are you encumbered? Only thing I can think of. One time I left baz to go to a raid (used my main as trader at that point) with like 200k on me or something... just couldn't figure out wth was wrong. By time I figure it out it was too late so I jsut raided w/ all the plat on me and kept selos up to move.<br>
<br>
If those answers don't help, get more info )<br>

<br>
Quote:<br>
Quote: <br>
This was mentioned in Las Vegas as having become more prevalent recently with some of the graphic engine upgrades. Whether or not it's actually related, I can't say for sure. But it is on the list of things to fix as soon as time allows <br>
<br>
-Ryan <br>
<br>
<br>
The biggest reason this has become prevalent is the reliance on the spell casting bar, which finally got fixed on processes, at least somewhat. The DX9 switch made it harder to keep four songs up reliably when using the casting bar. In essence, the casting bar was fixed, but also broken again. <br>
<br>
The casting bar is a measurement of the time it takes for a song to start. When the casting bar disappears the song is going. While the last part is correct, the first part is not. There is a one second lag on the bar, if not more. It equates to like one to two ticks on the bar graph. <br>
<br>
This existed with DX7 and DX8, but seems to have gotten increased in duration with DX9 just enough to cause the re-emergence of the start/stop plague. <br>

lemme explain: your comp timing some how has slowed down (or fastened if you know how to do it) and therefor 3 secs casting time takes 8 for your client, but 3-5 secs for the server to show the icon, also, when you run , it's the client that runs you (hence all the speed hacks, run hacks etc) the server only shows the speed of other people, and that's why you saw 100k drogmor outrunning you - your client is running you slowly but other people still run fast. <br>
Don't get me wrong here, it's not matter of how fast your system is, it's just the &quot;timing&quot; in EQ (ie one second in eq equals 3 secs for your comp)<br>
<br>
I really dunno why this happens, but i know how to make this happen, also, this bug only apeared on my laptop, not on my regular computer.<br>
<br>
There is also a different kind of this bug, that will make each sec like 0.2 real secs, and this one is way more annoying, your casting bar disapears after less then a sec, yet, your song will only apear after 3-4 secs after completing casting, think of it as if you had 10000 ping, it's really annoying, though you can pass places extremely fast (i passed from KT entrance to qvic in less then 5 secs). <br>
<br>
I have no clue how to fix this, but i know one way when it happens: my laptop has &quot;power saving&quot; modes, when i don't connect the AC adapter it will run at &quot;500 mhz&quot; when i connect it, it will run at the normal speed (around 1.5 ghz), now when i launch EQ when working on battery, it will run normal, but when i connect the AC adapter it speeds up the cpu clock, and EQ clock as well, making EQ moves extremely damn fast, and vice versa if i start connected to AC adapter and disconnect it, it will move slowly. <br>
<br>
(I dunno if this is actually your problem, but it sounds like it is)  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Zamaar Muserider</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Exactly! The rest of the descriptions matches my experience too.  Had laptop unplugged (centrino) and started eq, then noticed I didn't have power plugged in, did it, and vroom.  Was running round PoK at mach3.  Looked like everyone else was running fast too (kinda Benny hill movements), but after a couple of seconds, they went back to where they should of been.  Wierd to watch.  <br>
Only worry I had for this was it'd be a shame if I was banned for exploiting when it was only the powersaving on laptop that was causing it.  Guess it does the timing check on first init, not ever after game is running.  Definatly needs fixing, after all, everyone with a laptop can run faster than bards atm!<br>

<br>
Example: We were in VT and I was playing chants, and we switched mobs, and I continued. Next thing I know I'm waking up charmed mobs and I could not stop it ... I was on another mob ... and the chat was showing that my song (not the one I was playing!) was waking up a charmed mob ... <br>
<br>
Now that is totally full of shit, and it happened again later. <br>
<br>
Zone? <br>
<br>
Vex Thall ... we did great that night in there, but the lag was unreal. Don't think I have seen stuff like that since the crawl days in the bazaar! But song stuff lost or delayed is fucked! It seemed to do the same thing that it does when you go LD .. it goes after a mob so you die! <p>Moshkiae Soulwriter, the non role playing Bard / Mo'riae Soulwriter - Cleric</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moorsfang>Moorsfang</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 355<br> <font color=#330000>(7/9/04 10:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19575.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.celticlords.com/Images/Design5.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard Song Bugs...</span><hr size=1> Yea, I have to agree with the server side lag.<br>

In theory, all songs should end on 6 second boundaries, right?  Well, it seems to me since DX9, I will have a song drop on a 6 second boundary, and then 2-3 seconds later, another song drops.<br>

It also seems to me since DX9, that the time it takes for the system to tell me I have missed a note has increased, sometimes as much as 1/2 second? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moorsfang>Moorsfang</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/9/04 7:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=havek>Havek</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/nromero2/images/nnnradio.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 230<br> <font color=#330000>(7/9/04 10:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19575.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/nromero2/images/nnnradio.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard Song Bugs...</span><hr size=1> Did notice more lag than normal last night..for about 30 min the all of sudden went away.  <p>65 Bard <br>

Don't get me wrong here, it's not matter of how fast your system is, it's just the &quot;timing&quot; in EQ (ie one second in eq equals 3 secs for your comp)<br>
<br>
I really dunno why this happens, but i know how to make this happen, also, this bug only apeared on my laptop, not on my regular computer.<br>
<br>
There is also a different kind of this bug, that will make each sec like 0.2 real secs, and this one is way more annoying, your casting bar disapears after less then a sec, yet, your song will only apear after 3-4 secs after completing casting, think of it as if you had 10000 ping, it's really annoying, though you can pass places extremely fast (i passed from KT entrance to qvic in less then 5 secs). <br>
<br>
I have no clue how to fix this, but i know one way when it happens: my laptop has &quot;power saving&quot; modes, when i don't connect the AC adapter it will run at &quot;500 mhz&quot; when i connect it, it will run at the normal speed (around 1.5 ghz), now when i launch EQ when working on battery, it will run normal, but when i connect the AC adapter it speeds up the cpu clock, and EQ clock as well, making EQ moves extremely damn fast, and vice versa if i start connected to AC adapter and disconnect it, it will move slowly. <br>
<br>
(I dunno if this is actually your problem, but it sounds like it is) <br>

Do you have any clue how to fix it?  It is incredibly frustrating. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viante>viante</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Minstrel</span><br>  Posts: 299<br> <font color=#330000>(7/9/04 7:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19575.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bard Song Bugs...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have no clue how to fix this, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
