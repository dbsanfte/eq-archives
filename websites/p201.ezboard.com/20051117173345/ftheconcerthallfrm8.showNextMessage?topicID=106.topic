AA and you - hof or bust</span><hr size=1> ok the hall of fame AA post is so old it's kinda funny to read sooooooooooooo.... dammit time to revamp it. This sucks on many levels which I'll cover...<br>
<br>
1. Liq was there when it all happened. Every time new AA was introduced I had finished all remotely useful skills such that by next expansion I had 20  aa saved to use. I really do not know the relative value of say bellow to a staple like combat stability.<br>
<br>
2. there are a ton of aa now to get, organizing them is going to suck.<br>
<br>
3. There is NO RIGHT WAY. Other than the total non brainer of the fade  and run 3 skills, all others are conditional to how  your bard... There just is no point getting a skill like boastful bellow if you've never once ever pulled a mob ever in your same group of monk   whatever.<br>
<br>
4. Level vs. AA. Another thing I never had to contend with so I honestly do not know. At what point do you level to 65 and say screw the AA? 65 is not so hot without as many runes floating about and charm kiting is good up until only a certain level. I simply cannot cover that in this post.<br>
<br>
5. Gates aa is sooooo silly expensive compared to pop and sol skills that the only one I can really recommend for bards not over 300 aa is run 5 for ... gasp... 15 aa and instrument mastery for 12 aa<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There's 3 main skills that really impact the way you can play a bard. I'll name them here for ease of sight...<br>
<br>
run3 at level 51 - I get run 3 at level 51 on all my twinks<br>
Fading memories at level 63 - nuff said<br>
Boastful bellow at level 63- an amazing pull tool that ends up being like an extension of your bard's body. The skill is so taken for granted by me now it's hard to explain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
here's the condensed list with *rough* order of usefulness per set.<br>
<br>
 <br>
General: You need 6 points before advancing to arch.<br>
Innate Run Speed 3 - Is the total no brainer AA of the entire game. Just run 1 allows you to pull and run away from 95% of pregates mobs and not get hit. This skill lets you run away even at low hp.<br>
Innate Regeneration 3 - 3 regen is always good and you need 6 to advance, the only other skill you can really consider here is...<br>
Innate Metabolism - level 3 confers 50% less food and water consumption. In the world of baz bought stat food, this is an amazing skill. Seriously consider this skill after run 3 for 6 in general<br>
Innate resists 5 aa total 2 resists per aa... nice but definitely for when you got aa to kill.<br>
innate stats 5 aa total 2 stats [per aa... Good to shore up weak stats after a lot of aa, some stats are done just to finish all aa<br>
Innate Lung Capacity - Junk<br>
First Aid -for bards, junk for the most part, hey if your bind would is even capped (much less used!) then you know what this does. Give you a hint though, twist nivs and mana song.<br>
New Tanaan Crafting Mastery - tradeskills are the debil, not recommended first 6 but 300  aa sure. YOu know what this skill does if you are into debil worship<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Archetype Abilities: 12 needed to advance to class skills 2 4 6 points for 3 level skills<br>
Combat Agility - IMO THE BEST arch skill for bards period bar none. getting missed not only means you don;t any damage, it also means that bash cannot interrupt your songs. MAJOR skill imo get all 3 level before all other arch skills. GET THIS SKILL OMGOMGOMG <br>
Mental Clarity - more mana regen is good for fade. this skill is much more required with a person low ft in items than it is with ft 10 . overall tradable ft is rare still but that's subject to change.<br>
Natural Durability - more hp based on equipment is nice but hardly going to help you live past your magelo profile. decent enough skill AFTER combat agility.<br>
Combat Stability - Helps mobs that hit hard hit you less, not nearly as good as combat agility but nice nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Combat Fury - melee crits are fun, sue me. level 1 is a req for boastful bellow, a class defining skill so 2 points placed here is likely.<br>
Natural Healing - 12 aa for 3 more regen, regen is good, that this skill allows you to get  1 mana from class skills as well is better imo<br>
Channeling Focus - less missed notes.... mutter<br>
Spell Casting Fury - crits on our dd songs AND procs.. crits are fun, sue me. YES IT WORKS ON WEAPON PROCS KIDS<br>
Spell Casting Expertise - no more missed notes ever on songs up to level and including level 51... selo in all it's many forms is level 51 or below as I write this. I'll let you put selo and no missed notes ever together yourself. Do not dismiss this skill as useless out of hand.<br>
Finishing Blow - have a chance to outright kill low hp mobs that are running. You cannot use fear to force a finishing blow mk?  This has two edges to it. if you kill a lot of green mobs (and light blue after the pop version of this skill) then anon snared mob running away can get owned fast enough to stave more adds. The bard part is that a finishing blow on anything will force a kill steal since they have to compare to 32k damage - not good while pleveling toons.<br>
<br>
Fear Resistance - Very situational skill. a few raid encounters in the game really like this skill, you know them when you see them. Keep in mind you are not immune to fear based effects with this skill, just resistant.<br>
Spell Casting Subtlety - dunno I will never ever ever get this aa skill ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bard Class Abilities - 3 level skills are typically 3 6 12 for a total of 18 aa, that's getting pretty hefty.. <br>
Instrument Mastery The Bard as bard skill. acts as a  .6 modifier to all instruments skills other than singing. 18 aa well spent. See <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=44.topic">Here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for more details.<br>
<br>
Scribble Notes - makes meming songs as fast as casters. adds to the ability to swap out songs under tight situation especially when combined with the right click open gems for minimal sit down time. VERY power utility skill that's cheap, not all will find it useful though<br>
Singing Mastery - does for singing what im did for everything else. Good skill. See <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=44.topic">Here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> again for the details.<br>
Physical Enhancement - 2% more ca cs nd, a no brainer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Extended Notes - extends range of group and aoe songs. NOT targeted and not offensive aoe. combined with the pop version of this skill, song range is extended 40%. that's major for aoe songs on raids and open exp like pof tables. <br>
Ambidexterity - helps the off hand swing more.. more melee dps for a melee challenged class. woot? does NOT help off hand proc rate.<br>
Body and Mind Rejuvenation - another point of mana and hp regen, pretty hefty prereqs though as we are talking like 18 aa past mc 3<br>
Jam Fest - oh yeah, the official WTF skill that finally works. This skill helps songs in weird ways and not universally, this is not the thread to explain how it works but try<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=94.topic">Here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
Acrobatics - 18 aa for well not much, our safe fall cap is too low and as a plate based tank our weight is too high. Not the worst of junk skills by sure if you selo around without lev on a lot.<br>
Advanced Trap Negotiation - 18 aa for this is an insult. A front runner for more useless bard skill ever but gates is making it work for that distinction.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Planes of Power Advanced Abilities<br>
<br>
Planar Power - raises stat cap across the board. total cap ends up at 305 for all 7 stats not a bad skill at all since str is attack, agility is avoidance, stamina is hp, int is mana and cha is missed notes. Helps if you have equipment that sets you over 255 in these stats though.<br>
<br>
Innate resists... 10 more aa worth of each flavor of resists. for 15 total aa in any one resist from here and general, you have an innate  #0 to that resist. Not shabby at all.<br>
Innate stats .... 10 more aa per stat. some stats better than others depending on gear etc. <br>
<br>
<br>
Planes of Power Class Abilities<br>
<br>
Fading Memories - omgomgomg hit 63 and stop all exp, get fading memories. 6 aa is nothing compared to the power this gives bards. Monks hate us for this so be sure to taunt them with timely emotes.<br>
<br>
Boastful Bellow - needs melee crits as a pre req so think of it as an 8 aa skill. An amazing pull toy as it's a 250 range, insta cast mini DD that can stun up to level 60 mobs. YOu need los to use it now (p0) but can be cast while you are singing another song and will change your target to that bellowed mid song. I'll let you decide how useful that is to you. Liq gives it 4 thumbs up! (I'm borrowing reeds thumbs here)  <br>
<br>
Lightning Reflexes - More combat agility omgomgomg good<br>
Harmonious Attack - THE bard as melee skill so far in game. this adds a good chunk to our pathetic melee.<br>
Innate Defense - more combat stability, not as good as the combat agility line<br>
Sionachie’s Crescendo - same as extended notes, total is  40%. A major raid skill to get.<br>
<br>
Ayonae’s Tutelage - ups the instrument cap, this does not help songs out unless you have elemental   instruments and the proper instruement/singing mastery. See <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=43.topic">Here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for info on the cap.<br>
Fury of the Ages - more melee crits!!! crits are fun, sue me. <br>
Mastery of the Past - upp the no fizzle to level 57 songs.. most notable songs here are the aoe resists (which have a higher fizzle rate) and the cure songs.<br>
Fleet of Foot - YOU go a bit faster.... not anyone else. I like this skill because I have way too many aa and for seloing other people, I follow them. Since I'm faster than anyone else, I can keep up np. this skill ups the run cap to like 168% of walk or so, nothing earth shattering but I do notice rain doesn't have it.<br>
Coup de Grace - up final blow insta kill to level 58 mobs. Actually useful for time snare is forgotten on light blues.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gates AA..<br>
<br>
work in progress so far. If anyone have a list of the skills please post it, I'm not in the mood to hand carry them over from in game.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So blah<br>
<br>
It's late, Liq couldn;t sleep when he started this but is bored enough to flop over now. please run past this, point out mistakes, opinions and keep in mind this is hall of fame bound for archive. any posts that contain good info will survive<br>
the final prune so feel free to embellish. List of how you did AA really doesn't really help since the vast majority of us pre-date gates aa. Not even sure this is the place to discuss AA vs. EXP.<br>
<br>
I'll try and hammer the rest of this out in the coming weeks. Oh and Liq is so full of it so feel free to tell him that if you see he's just flat out wrong on something.<br>
<br>
oh and pad effed up the formatting bad I prolly missed some areas were it's screwy<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
