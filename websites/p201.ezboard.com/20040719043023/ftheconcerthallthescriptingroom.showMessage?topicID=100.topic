Few even glanced at the figure bundled in the corner and those that did peer at her thought nothing of it. She noticed not the occasional curious stares her way but was wrapped up in memories of times gone past of friends she had known and lost and those that still lived few that they were.<br>
<br>
She sat there remembering past fights, battles and skirmishes and winced in remembered pain at old scars. She remembered spending many nights staring at the heavens before going to sleep and the many songs and stories she shared and listened to around campfires and taverns such as this one. Under her cloak she idly fingered the lute and felt the magic’s it possessed teasing her memory. How many songs had she sung with it she wondered then suddenly broke into a grin when she came across a deep divot in the side of the lute that is were it connected with the drunken barbarian many years ago when he had tried to grasp her in drunken lust it was a day he never lived down felled by a lute of all things.<br>
<br>
As quickly as the smile came it disappeared for this lute had also saved her life as well as the lives of countless others to many to count how many had she taken with it as well she did not want to remember and the faces of those she had killed yet again surfaced in her mind and she grimaced the memories away. She was tired of killing was tired of constantly being on guard and peering suspiciously at every shadow. Even though her elven features showed her as young maybe mid twenties she was well over 300 yrs old. She had seen too much and remembered too much she had had enough it was time to leave it behind.<br>
<br>
A commotion near the fire place broke her of her thoughts and smiled when she saw 2 dwarves get into a huge sneezing fit after inhaling pepper spices and watching as those near the dwarves scrambled to get away from them as their spittle went flying everywhere. Soon all was back to normal and she settled deep into her cloak again. <br>
<br>
With a shrug of finality she stood up and wove her way to the tavern door where she turned and looked at the patrons once again and wondered if she could ever be as care free as those that sat within like the days of her youth. With a sad smile she turned and walked out of the tavern and sure footedly wended her way to a brightly coloured building with a sign over it reading &quot;League of the Antonican bards&quot; and listened to the music wafting from within the building and smiled at memories past from her days of training there and knocked on the door.<br>
<br>
The man who answered the door was perplexed had someone knocked or was he hearing things for no one stood there. Ah well he thought must be my hearing going then something caught his eye near the single lantern that lit the doorway hanging neatly from a peg was a belt laden with instruments and weapons and on the lute was a parchment and written in careful elvish was the following<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Please look after these weapons and instruments they have served me well throughout the years.<br>
<br>
Tandari Songwyver<br>
<br>
                             Half elven minstrel<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once again glancing around he quickly but reverently gathered the belt, weapons and instruments then hurriedly ran back into the guildhouse calling for the guildmaster to meet with him at once.<br>
<br>
Outside a pair of elvish eyes peered out from underneath a cloak and a hand came up to wipe the tears that formed in the elven eyes. The bard turned on the guildhouse and disappeared into the night.<br>
