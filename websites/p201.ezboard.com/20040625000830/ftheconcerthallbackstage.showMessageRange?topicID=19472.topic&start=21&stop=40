The reason Omens was pushed back was to free up devs to work on this stuff that should of been addressed long ago. The big question is where are the resources going to come from to have continued live development and support of the game that isnt reliant on developers that are working on the next expansion or EQ 2. What has changed that we won't see the same thing happen with the omens release. Are they going to bring more people onto the EQ live team so that a month after omens is released they don't run into the same problem of not having the people to address issues that are widely known. This is an issue I haven't seen talked about much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prathuneq>Prathun EQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EQ Developer</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#330000>(6/6/04 5:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19472.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yes its really true</span><hr size=1> All of the following are true:<br>
<br>
1) Compatibility and collision issues due to the DirectX 9 changes on Beta made it difficult to effectively test content<br>
2) Designers were being aggressive with difficulty in their encounters  (Cragbeast Queen v1.0 = impossible = my fault!)<br>
3) We were anticipating a level cap increase and associated power gain shortly after the release of Gates<br>
4) Content was created late in the development cycle and we simply ran out of testing time<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that the playerbase's initial taste of Gates was soured by bugs or untuned encounters.  We're still making tweaks to the expansion now, and the retuning we have done has made a world of difference.  In addition to what's already done, we have many more changes lined up to keep the expansion challenging and rewarding while eliminating some of the more frustrating timesinks and imbalances.  <br>
<br>
Most importantly, the above are mistakes that I know we can avoid in the future, and we will.<br>

Other than a few typos, and leaving off of Robert Pfister's name, it's pretty much word for word the same:<br>
<br>
June 5, 2004<br>
<br>
Dear Guild and Community Representatives,<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for a great Summit.  By all accounts it was a huge success.  I can speak for the EverQuest Development Team and tell you that we’re all grateful for the input you provided.  In fact, in trying to generate this list to give to you this evening, we realized there was so much to go over that we wouldn’t be able to get a complete list together in time.  We’re committed to not only listening to your feedback, but working with you to make EverQuest more enjoyable for years to come.<br>
<br>
So, we decided to list the Top Ten themes we would b addressing starting Monday, as well as the most common themes that we’ll come back with more information on by mid-week next week.<br>
<br>
A quick discussion resulted in a list of items that we will immediately address:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Add scripting to shut off empty instances of Plane of Time<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Raid message of the day<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Improving how we handle beta and the testing process<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Increase the number of rebuffs allowed on MOBs<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Increase buffs on players through AA’s<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Note field on the raid window<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Improved consent &amp; drag for raid, group and guild<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Improve corpse drag radius<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Make charms not no-drop<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Guild and individual rewards for guild beta testing<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Work on larger To Do list… I know this is a little random<br>
<br>
Future items we will immediately begin looking at and discussing are as follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Plane of Time instancing and other issues<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Back Flagging solutions to help with High-end guild atrophy<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Improved raid and guild functionality<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Auto loot all for your corpse<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Improvements to Raid XP<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Review the Epic 2.0 quests<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * No more alien NPCs ;-) (focusing more on familiar Norrathian themes)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Solo LDoN-style instances or similar content<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Issues with item augmentations<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp * Possible enhancement to Guild Wars<br>
<br>
Of course these aren’t all of [the] items.  You brought us a CD, 2 books, 20 printed sheets, and a manifesto.  We’ll need to go through all of those and our notes before we can really get a good tally of all the wonderful ideas and questions that were presented.<br>
<br>
Thank you again for your feedback and participation.  We’ve had a great weekend and a wonderful display of things to come.<br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
Robert Pfister<br>
Executive Producer<br>
EverQuest<br>
<br>
And the EverQuest Development Team!<br>

<br>
The people attending the summit were divided into 5 small groups (10-15 people), each of which met for 4.5 hours over the day to give input to SOE.  That's 22.5 hours worth of meetings.  In each of the meetings I was at, there were always at least 3 SOE employees taking notes.  That's a heck of a lot of notes, on many different suggestions.<br>
<br>
Between the meetings and the dinner, SOE gathered the note takers and came up with a quick &quot;starting&quot; list to hand out to the attendees so they would have something to go home with.  Hence the letter (posted above) handed out at the dinner.<br>
<br>
SOE will be spending the next week organizing the information, prioritizing it into &quot;can be done quickly&quot; and &quot;will take more time&quot; groups, and making sure it gets to the right departments so that they can make the adjustments to make the game more fun for all of us. <p>~Lorilei<br>

That is wonderful.<br>
<br>
However, I honestly feel the level cap should NOT be raised. Continue with level 65, its high enough. PoP was a cool expansion, but it basically eliminated the entire old word, as defined as SoL, Kunar and classic Norrath.<br>
<br>
Keep level 65 as the top level, I mean, we toppled the gods themselves with level 65, were practically demigods. Tune conent for 65 and revamp some old stuff to accomodate this. I do not want to see level 70 and be funnled into the next expansions XP zones and be able to raid everything in PoP with 24 people. <br>
<br>
A good solid guild can already progress PoP with raids of 40, level 70 would simply break this.<br>
<br>
Expansion = good, mudflation is not. Utilizing the vast world already established and its accompanying lore = golden.<br>
<br>
So keep fixing the game, and flesh out the vast world you already have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://p201.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.showUserPublicProfile?gid=genado>Genado</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The bard who screamed 'nerf!'</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#330000>(6/6/04 7:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19472.topic&index=28>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Im gonna play devils advocate a second...if you raise the cap to 70 peopole can get into time with 54 people then when theyre done they can raid GoD which is capped at 54!

And even if they nerfed it to that degree, the monk whiners would still not be satisified.  I hope SOE someday realizes that the whole monk whine movement was not really about monks being underpowered; it was simply &quot;leaders&quot; within that community jockeying for power by attacking another group of people. <p>--<BR>

As it stands fading memories is really the one thing bards do that is actually affected by gear. Everything else is determined more by aa than gear. This due to the main songs we play are not affected by mods, or hit hard caps on resists and stats.<br>
<br>
Though I think I could argue that fading by high end bards is less broken than dps classes that do 3 - 4 times the damage as bazaar equiped dps classes, or healers healing for more and longer than bazaar equiped healers.<br>
<br>
Though if it does become based on %mana it will mean the more mana you have the less you will be able to fade <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Most of the other changes I saw seemed pretty decent. Though I think they really need to figure out something for bard itemization in the end game since it has been one of the main reason for high end bards are leaving. Only gaining a little hp/mana while other classes get large improvements sometimes makes me feel like <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :brickwall --><img src=http://members.cox.net/skoriksis/smilies/brickwall.gif ALT=":brickwall"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
