Shortly after The Triad (KEG/MFH/CIW) received news that Vox and Nagafen were rampaging the countryside, a call to battle was issued forth.  Many valiant soldiers of The Triad arrived at the respective lairs and pushed past the guardians of the Dragons, to do battle with Nagafen and Vox.  Both of them were armed with new abilities and powers, but our battle field general, Snaggle Tooth (KEG), was able to adapt our technics and we were victorious once again.  An incredible 8 dragon kills were scored in a one week period on The Rathe!  Once again, our newfound solidarity and allies with The Triad has proven that we are an unstoppable force when we come together.</font></BLOCKQUOTE>

Friday night with a combined effort of Knights of Eternal Good, Emef`Aitch, and Clan Icewind we defeated the savage wyrm Lord Nagafen! This event was organized by the Great General Snaggle Tooth. I have to say this was the cleanest kill of Nagafen i have ever experienced in my 5 or 6 raids in his lair. This also proved what most people  have known for a long time....KEG/MFH/CIW is an unbeatable combination. For loot description please visit www.everquester.com for the screenshots. Grats to Pann, he recieved an Orb of Tashania! Sunday's Efreeti run started with a few deaths and evacs, but ended up with us liberating 2 Djarn Amethyst rings, and 1 pair of Efreeti boots. Later that evening we made a visit to the Ghoul Lord, with great success! 3 more Ykesha's are now in the guild! I would like to welcome Kieri, and Sarri into the Clan, its great to have you aboard. Also we are happy to have Kinekie back in EQ, and Yendor back from hiatus! In closing please remember that one persons action reflect on  us as a guild, travel in peace and love.

We managed to liberate 4 pair of boots and 1 ring =) Special thanks to Mikaela for her help! FYI we need to concentrate on getting Fishbone earrings, or Rebreathers for some guild outings to Kedge Keep. KK has some AWESOME items that we are missing out on. FYI Hadden is the mob that drops the fishbone, he is located in Qeynos Hills zone. He spawns at the Lake in QH, in front of the shed the Axe Broadsmith stands in. He spawns every 6 hours. The best way to camp this is to time it, and be back for the spawn at least 1 hour before to save the spot. If the spot is being camped watch him spawn...DO NOT cast on it...mark the time Hadden dies..then come back for next spawn. Well thats all i have for now. Be safe! Sty

     Well we managed to harvest our first Flowing Black Sash as a guild! Talk about a long camp. It took us 3 different days of camping the Frenzy room to get it. We are hoping to get mnay more, along with covering some other prime spots soon. To do this we need everyone to start camping L Guk with us. I know everyone likes the safety of Oggok, but its time to get in the dungeons, and learn some real fighting tactics. This will help al of you immensely, as well as make it a more enjoyable game. On another note, please hit members message board on a regular basis. All new recruits are posted there. I want to know of any problems you have had with these peeople in game. Thats it fer now.

    Last night i was invited to participate in a raid on Vox with KEG. Well, everything was going great, We failed on first wave, onbly took her to 45% life. I died in that battle to the npc LD. When i came back to loot my body....to my surprise i had Giants Toes in place of my Paw of Opalla! OMG! Anyway, after ressing, rebuffing, etc, we sent in the 2nd wave. This time we were able to vanquish Vox. But to our surprise, the corpse was sucked into the wall. =( Heh you guessed it, we got screwed by verant again. Traikis the Rude was the GM at the time. He was ignoring us, not replying to anything we asked. Of course he wouldn't help us with Vox, and also wouldnt help me with the Paw situation. He cant verify it was a paw i held to begin with! GRRR. Yeah, I am probably the best equipped Shaman on the server....but i need to lie to him to get a PAW......I really despise GM's like this. I have reported him to the higher authorities also. So anyway Verant screwed us all again. Why am I surprised? If i treated my customers the way Verant treats us, I would be homeless. Ok sorry for the rant, but i really wanted for everyone to know what happened, and what to expect from Traikis. Cya...Love Sty</font></BLOCKQUOTE>

<font size=3 color="#0000ff"><b> Festival of the Winds III (The Rathe) </b></font> <br><font size=2 color="#000000"><b> Saturday, September 11, 1999 at 11:58:55 </b></font><br><br><br><BLOCKQUOTE><font size=2>Festival of the Winds III (The Rathe)



Hear ye, hear ye!  It is with great anticipation, that we announce the third Festival of the Winds, sponsored by Clan Icewind.  Although the tradition of the first festivals was started by my former and now disbanded guild, Clan Banzai, I'm happy to say that my new guild has decided to carry this particular tradition on.  We invite you to join us in renewing this tradition, to come join us for a drink or two, to share stories of your valor, and to partake of the activities we hope to entertain you with.<br>
<br>
<br>

Server:  	<b>The Rathe</b><br>

Where:<b>	The North Ro Tunnel in East Commonlands</b><br>

When:	<b>Sunday, September 12th 3:00PM EST</b><br>

Who: 	<b>All races are invited to attend Happy Hour, although some of our activities may require the exclusion of our darker kin.</b><br>
<br>
<br>

3:00 PM EST	Happy Hour & Trivia Contests<br>
<br>
4:00 PM EST	Fox Hunts<br>
<br>
5:00 PM EST	Tree Hugging!<br>
<br>
5:30 PM EST	Hunt the Wumpus<br>
<br>
Finale		Disbursement of gifts and prizes<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Happy Hour & Trivia Contests</b><br>
<br>
Gather ye around my friends, tis a time to share stories of far away lands, boast of valorous battle stories, and most of all a time to relax in the company of friends, while enjoying a drink or two.  We  will be on hand with free drinks throughout this hour, while supplies last.  Although we would love to quench the thirst of all our fellow adventurers, once we run through several hundred drinks, we will have to insist ye purchase yer own.  Also, throughout the hour, we will be fielding various trivia questions, and awarding prizes to the first person who answers it correctly!  Please, refrain from answering more than one trivia question, if you have already won a prize, from a previous question.<br>


<br>
<b>Fox Hunts</b><br>
<br>
After everyone has had a bit to drink, and stories of glory and valor have been told, ye may want to clear your senses a bit for the next activity.  The Fox Hunts will be open to all to participate, but is geared for those of 12th level and below.  All Fox Hunts will start by the Shady Swashbuckler in the North Ro Tunnel of East Commonlands.  Basically, a designated Clan Icewind member will be named as the Fox, and he/she will hide and move throughout the following areas:  East Commonlands, North Ro, and the entirety of Freeport.  The first participant to invite the Fox into their group, and be within Line of Sight distance of the fox, will be awarded a prize!  As mentioned before, anyone can participate, but the prizes will most likely be 10 Plat, a piece banded armor (your choice except for cloaks and gloves), a Fine Steel weapon (your choice from what we have in our inventory), and whatever else we might have on hand.  We intend to hold at least 4 hunts in 1 hour, time permitting.  One last note, winners of a Fox Hunt, will be asked to not participate in any other Fox Hunts on that night.<br>
<br>


<b>Tree Hugging!</b><br>
<br>
An activity any true woodsman would delight in!  During the course of this activity, several members of Clan Icewind will polymorph themselves into a tree of some sort within the East Commonlands.  The first person to find a "tree" and gives them a hug will win a prize!  Should there be only one tree on hand, we will hold this event multiple times.  As with all other activities, please refrain from hugging more than one tree, so that we may award others that are also deserving.<br>
<br>


<b>Hunt the Wumpus</b><br>
<br>
After having you fill of hugging trees, it's time for a bit of hunting!  At the appropriate time, we will let ye know it is time to hunt the Wumpus.  The Wumpus is a mystical creature and can take many forms!  Ye may have to hunt many creatures before finally finding a wumpus.  Rest assured, ye will be rewarded by the wumpus themselves after slaying one!<br>
<br>


<b>Finale</b><br>
<br>
After a long night of storytelling, drinking, and participating in various hunts, we will end the night with one last round of drinks, and the awarding of prizes and gifts.  Please come and join us for this part of the Festival, so we may thank each of you for attending.  Thank ye, and be safe!<br>

A combined force of KEG, CIW, BoS, and a many others braved the fiery depths of Solusek B to engage in a battle that lasted 90 minutes. From CIW, Darkwind, Aosinator, Taveren, and myself attended. After fighting our way past Fire Giants, and Lava beetles we attacked the beast. Nagafen is quite the badass! I have to say everyone there had a minimum of 2 deaths. Personally i went down 7 times. But binding everyone close made it so we didnt have much downtime. After taking Nag down to 25% life he had slaughtered  basically everyone in the groups. So after ressing everyone, rebuffing, resummoning, Nag ewas back up to 65% life. Thats when the call for the 2nd wave came. At this point, the rally cry went out. After the leaders convinced people to forget about exp, the rage of the Rathe finally bore through. We sent wave after wave of people and pets to there death. Finally we took the Dragon down! This is truly a great accomplishment, and an EPIC battle i will never forget! Sure i lost 3 full bubbles of Exp, and level 50, but hey, this is why i play the game! I hope we can get more CIW to go next trip. Vox is going down next! Farewell till my next post. Love Stygar </font></BLOCKQUOTE>

Alot of CIW were debating leaving the Lost Souls guild for the last few weeks.

Varied reasons, but bottom line, we missed the family atmosphere we had come to know and love. LS did nothing wrong, they will still remain allies. But with fear revamped, and dragons tweaked up, the reason we merged (to kill dragons, and fear outings) became a mute point. We also have a few new members coming in Kineki lv 49/Maitai lv 26, Aosinator 49cleric/Amruila26 wizzie, Zastitnik lv 25 paladin, Baktogib lv 30 Shaman. Please make them feel at home. =) New membership rules will be posted soon. Some changes will include needing 3 sponsors to join. I wanna keep CIW very tightknit family atmosphere. Best way to do this is kee[p it fairly small. Well thats all for now, I will be posting more often now, along with others. Be safe!

Due to numerous factors, there has been a proposed merge between Clan IceWind and Lost Souls.  A few of our long time Clan IceWind founders will be joining Lost Souls to help them traverse the depths of Norrath.  Also, a lot of our other long term members will be playing on the new Race War Server.  While this may seem like a major blow to the IceWind family, it is not really.  We are spreading our clan over to another server and are expanding our knowledge of our land.  While some of us are not Clan IceWind in title, we will still be IceWind at heart.  This does not mean that those leaving are abandoning the ones that are staying, but are leaving the nest as they explore the rest of the world.  If anyone has any concerns, please feel free to give me a tell, email, or message on the message board.</font></BLOCKQUOTE>

I would like to comment on the mission of finding Mura's body. It was last Saturday when all of a sudden, all the clannies online decided to establish a mission to help get her body at the Ogre camp at W karana. Guildmates from all around traveled over to help the poor victim and to clear the Ogre camp. Chief Stygar lead the army on the roads that brough us to the Ogre camp where we formed two groups. I was in G2, whose duty was to take out the guards and pets.. basically the left overs. The elite group ripped everything in their sights and saw Chief Goonda fall to their feet. All in all, we were successful and saw that the camp was all cleaned out. Mura quickly pulled her body out, and we went home.

    Well the guild is growing by leaps and bounds now. I get numerous requests each day to join, and i also hear the respest people have for our guild. Makes me real proud of everyone. I have recently ran into a problem with who can and cant be in CIW. I am putting a limit on how many characters each membver can have titled to 2. Basically the reasoning is I dont want the guild to become watered down with lower characters. Pick the 2 PC's u play most and get them titled. I dont want to put level limits on people, but u need to level them as fast as possible. Clan Icewind is in Norrath to help people, and to spread the word of righteousness and goodwill to others. Please respond to this limiting in message area.

To speak in guild talk, right click ur journal area, and click guildtalk. The game is much more fun to me, being able  to talk to whole guild! If u havent been titled contact me in game, and we will remedy that quickly! Or see an councilor. The High Council is...... Ethion, Asmoran, Pann, Karrde, Darkwind, myself. Any ideas, concerns, problems, involving the guild or its members, should be brought to immediate attention of 1 of these people. Remember anything we do, reflects on whole guild.

<blockquote>

I could'nt have been more wrong. The Barbarians tamed down when they noticed us. They even pulled some gnolls to us to kill. They made it clear that all the normal gnolls we could take were ours. Even on some of the harder ones their warriors would taunt for us or help us out so we did'nt die. <p>



I'd like to thank the following; Speaker, Alexa, Karrde, Pann and Wargfor all of Clan Icewind. Keep up the good work Clan Icewind.

<font size=3 color="#0000ff"><b> Another Patch! </b></font> <br><br><BLOCKQUOTE><font size=2>Another update from smed...<blockquote>Hello All,<p>Well.. thanks to all of your help we've been able to find a significant corpse dissapearence bug. We feel that this is a significant enough problem to warrant updating the servers during normal hours today, as we don't want anyone else's corpses to dissapear. We've also extended the amount of online time characters above 5th level have to recover their bodies from 8 hours to 24 hours (online).<p>In a nutshell, the Corpse Recovery rules are as follows:<p>Characters All Levels: If you have no items on your corpse, it will dissapear within 3 minutes.<p>Characters Level 1-5: Corpse will dissapear within 30 minutes (real time) whether you are online or offline. Those of you wondering why this rule is in place? - There would be WAY to many bodies if we didn't do it this way.<p>Characters Level 6 and above - Corpse will dissapear within 24 hours if the player is online (being at the character select screen STILL counts as online). Corpses will dissapear within 1 week if the player is offline.<p>In addition, this server patch will include the following:<p>1) Warrior's now get a "Bezerker Frenzy" if they are down to under 35% of their Hit Points.<br>2) Several server side crash bugs have been fixed.<p>I also wanted to mention that we have begun shipping units to Europe. Units should be in Electronics Boutique in the UK in a few days. Germany and other places in Europe will be hitting shortly...and Austrailia will be seeing units shortly as well.<p><br>John Smedley</blockquote>        </font></BLOCKQUOTE>

Bad news for all of us late night players on the west coast...<br><BLOCKQUOTE>April 14th, Noon<br>------------------ <br>After researching our user base's hours of play, a decision has been made to move the scheduled server downtime from 3:00am PST to Midnight PST every Tuesday, unless otherwise noted. This decision was made so that the least amount of EverQuest players would be effected during the update. The estimated downtime of 1 hour will remain. <P>On a related note, the EverQuest servers will be coming down for an update tonight at midnight, Pacific Standard Time. The fixes are listed below. <P>1) Two server side zone related crashes have been resolved. <br>2) A bug with the charm spell which caused players to be killed. <br>3) A small number of players were having their characters become corrupt -- additional safeguards have been implemented to prevent against this occurring, however, we feel that the changes made eliminated the problem. <br>4) A few minor NPC combat related exploits have been rectified.<br> - The EverQuest Team </BLOCKQUOTE></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

Thiswill be a pretty good update since it fixes a number of things Server Sideas well as making some enhancements to the client, including allowing Glidefor Banshees.<P>One VERY, VERY important note. Banshee users should go to the 3dfx websiteand download the latest drivers. If you don't, you run the risk of lockingup with Black Screen upon trying to enter the game. I expect this will bethe major cause of people's grief for the next 24 hours (Banshee owners thatis).<P>Also, we've found to critical bugs Server Side.. One is a crash bug and oneis the cause of a lot of people losing their corpses when they shouldn'thave. This is the number one thorn in our side (and your's I'm sure) andwe're happy that it's fixed. These patches are up on the Test Server forthose of you that want to check them out early.<P>Thanks,<br>John Smedley</BLOCKQUOTE></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

   Welcome everyone to the website! tell ur friends to check it out too.  Well last few days have been BAD and good too.  % guildmates went to befallen for the first time. Now i know why its called Befallen. I died 3 times there, Asmoran 3, Borron 2, Taveren 2, Selana 1. Be forwarned, it takes strict group play to survive in there. We had a guy with us, that just kept pulling monsters with no rest, and thet equation usually means death. When we have 6 members there we will do fine. BTW anyone needs banded armor just contact me. We have a girl in freeport that is kinda reasonable. Better prices than most. hurry up and level to 18 guys. Mamma woolies give tusks worth 9pp =)  See ya soon Love Sty  </font></BLOCKQUOTE>
