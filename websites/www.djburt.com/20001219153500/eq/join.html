<b>Recruitment Policies:</b><br><br>
<ol>
<li> New recruits are required to know and acknowledge our code of honor.<br><br>
<li> New recruits must post a message on our New Members Application message board that includes the following information:<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Class, level, race and name of their primary character.
<li> Class, level, race and name of any alternate characters above level 20.
<li> Anything else ye may want us to know about you.
</ul><br>
<li> New recruits are required to obtain sponsorship from at least eight (8) Clan members.<br><br>
<li> A notification of a new recruit's intent to join our Clan will be posted for our General Membership to examine.<br><br>
<ul>
<li> All members have the obligation to post a formal protest, if they feel the new recruit is not the proper material to join our clan.
<li> Formal protests will be examined by the High Council. The High Council will investigate the protest, and the circumstances regarding the new recruit. 
<li> If the High Council feels the concern is valid, the new recruit's application will be dismissed.
</ul><br>
<li> A vote will be held by the High Council on the new recruit's application.<br><br>
<ul>
<li> If the new recruit receives so much as a single no vote, their application will be dismissed. The only way to gain admittance at this point, would be to find a Council member willing to sponsor your appeal.
<li> Only a unanimous overturning vote by the council will qualify as a successful appeal.
</ul><br>
<li> New recruits will be required to complete a high council quest.<br><br>
<li> Upon completion of the quest, new recruits will be inducted into the guild on a 1 month probationary period.<br><br>
<li> If during the probationary period, any member of the clan has a problem with the new recruit, the new recruit will be removed from the guild. A unanimous overturning vote by the council however, will mean reinstatement of your guild status.<br><br>
<li> Upon permanent induction into the guild, it is the requirement of all members to actively read our message boards. This is primarily to make it easier to disseminate any vital information, as well as to keep up to date on clan activities.<br><br>
