  Raid went well. We met at Dagnor Cauldron where Lerkin was very generous to 
  give out loot <b>before</b> the raid. <b>Many thanks to Lerkin!</b> ^_^ We split 
  our members into two groups. Vivii's team was made up of Lerkin, Laelin, Lildee 
  and Vivii. Maulo's team was made up of Ealadn, Sonaki, Karmer and Maulo. We 
  were all given Wolf Form by Lashwana and Tishla, btw many thanks to Lashwana 
  and Tishla, and made our way to the basement. We were in the Ghost room hoping 
  the of getting a Darkbone Skull from a skelly for the Acumen Mask quest but 
  no dice. We held the Ghost Room until we lost Sonaki and Karmer to a small train. 
  While waiting for an exp rez the Ghost, Tentacle Terror and everything in the 
  basement imaginable popped in the ghost room and over powered us. We gunned 
  for the zone but Vivii evaced her team to NK. Maulo's team was either dead or 
  gated. Maulo successfully evaced himself from the pittrp by the bloodpool while 
  being beaten to death by a giant mushroom. We regroup at Faydark and headed 
  back towards Unrest. After Sonaki and Karmer were rezed, we were all given Wolf 
  Form by Lashwana and Tishla, again many thanks to Lashwana and Tishla. We made 
  our way to the hand room in hopes of him popping and dropping a mana bracelet 
  but no luck. At about 7PM PST after killed Hags and PHs we called it a night. 
  We Ported to Faydark and rolled on loot. Some highlights of the loot were a 
  Festering Cloak that was won by Laelin and a Gossimer Sleeves won by Lildee.</font></p>
