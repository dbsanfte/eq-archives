            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. We all know 
              that this is just a game. Real life always comes first; so if you 
              cannot attend raids/events/meetings, please let an officer know. 
              (We do understand that things also happen unexpectedly, RL has a 
              way of surprising everyone.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Explanation 
              of &#145;Need Before Greed&#146;: A friend once told me that I was 
              not wrong in disagreeing with the common usage of &#145;Need Before 
              Greed&#146;. &#147;Need before greed, is greed itself,&#148; he 
              said. And it is true. Unless your group has planned and made getting 
              a Ranger only item for a Ranger in the group its main goal, need 
              before greed does not seem logical. In a group everyone is putting 
              in his/her part into the group&#146;s success. Healers heal, Tankers 
              tank, and Nukers nuke. So it can be seen that all members should 
              have the option of rolling on the dropped item. Now if twinking 
              was really a bad thing, why were we provided with 8 slots to make 
              characters? Twinking is encouraged, so by all means make your characters 
              happy! =)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. We are in 
              this guild to help each other out, and to have a good time. Be yourself, 
              and enjoy the company. Know that you are a part of something great, 
              a fun bright group of intelligent people; you are a part of Fearless 
              Black!</font></p>
