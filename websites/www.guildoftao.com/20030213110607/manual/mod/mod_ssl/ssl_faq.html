What is the history of mod_ssl?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#history"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The mod_ssl v1 package was initially created in April 1998 by <a
    href="mailto:rse@engelschall.com">Ralf S. Engelschall</a> via porting <a
    href="mailto:ben@algroup.co.uk">Ben Laurie</a>'s <a
    href="http://www.apache-ssl.org/">Apache-SSL</a> 1.17 source patches for
    Apache 1.2.6 to Apache 1.3b6. Because of conflicts with Ben
    Laurie's development cycle it then was re-assembled from scratch for
    Apache 1.3.0 by merging the old mod_ssl 1.x with the newer Apache-SSL
    1.18. From this point on mod_ssl lived its own life as mod_ssl v2. The
    first publically released version was mod_ssl 2.0.0 from August 10th,
    1998. As of this writing (August 1999) the current mod_ssl version is 2.4.0.
    <p>
    After one year of very active development with over 1000 working hours and
    over 40 releases mod_ssl reached its current state. The result is an
    already very clean source base implementing a very rich functionality.
    The code size increased by a factor of 4 to currently a total of over
    10.000 lines of ANSI C consisting of approx. 70% code and 30% code
    documentation. From the original Apache-SSL code currently approx. 5% is
    remaining only.
<p>
<li><a name="ToC3"></a>
    <a name="apssl-diff"></a>
    <strong id="faq">
What are the functional differences between mod_ssl and Apache-SSL, from where
it is originally derived?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#apssl-diff"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    This neither can be answered in short (there were too many code changes)
    nor can be answered at all by the author (there would immediately be flame
    wars with no reasonable results at the end). But as you easily can guess
    from the 5% of remaining Apache-SSL code, a lot of differences exists,
    although user-visible backward compatibility exists for most things.
    <p>
    When you really want a detailed comparison you have to read the entries in
    the large <code>CHANGES</code> file that is in the mod_ssl
    distribution. Usually this is much too hard-core. So I recommend you to
    either believe in the opinion and recommendations of other users (the
    simplest approach) or do a comparison yourself (the most reasonable
    approach). For the latter, grab distributions of mod_ssl (from <a
    href="http://www.modssl.org/">http://www.modssl.org</a>) and Apache-SSL
    (from <a href="http://www.apache-ssl.org/">http://www.apache-ssl.org</a>),
    install both packages, read their documentation and try them out yourself.
    Then choose the one which pleases you most.
    <p>
    A few final hints to help direct your comparison: quality of documentation
    ("can you easily find answers and are they sufficient?"), quality of
    source code ("is the source code reviewable so you can make sure there
    aren't any trapdoors or inherent security risks because of bad programming
    style?"), easy and clean installation ("can the SSL functionality easily
    added to an Apache source tree without manual editing or patching?"),
    clean integration into Apache ("is the SSL functionality encapsulated and
    cleanly separated from the remaining Apache functionality?"), support for
    Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) facility ("can the SSL functionality built as
    a separate DSO for maximum flexibility?"), Win32 port ("is the SSL
    functionality available also under the Win32 platform?"), amount and
    quality of functionality ("is the provided SSL functionality and control
    possibilities sufficient for your situation?"), quality of problem tracing
    ("is it possible for you to easily trace down the problems via logfiles,

What are the major differences between mod_ssl and
the commercial alternatives like Raven or Stronghold?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#apssl-diff"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    In the past (until September 20th, 2000) the major difference was
    the RSA license which one received (very cheaply in contrast to
    a direct licensing from RSA DSI) with the commercial Apache SSL
    products. On the other hand, one needed this license only in the US,
    of course. So for non-US citizens this point was useless. But now
    even for US citizens the situations changed because the RSA patent
    expired on September 20th, 2000 and RSA DSI also placed the RSA
    algorithm explicitly into the public domain.
    <p>
    Second, there is the point that one has guaranteed support from
    the commercial vendors. On the other hand, if you monitored the
    Open Source quality of mod_ssl and the support activities
    found on <a href="mailto:modssl-users@modssl.org">
    <code>modssl-users@modssl.org</code></a>, you could ask yourself
    whether you are really convinced that you can get better support
    from a commercial vendor.
    <p>
    Third, people often think they would receive perhaps at least a
    better technical SSL solution than mod_ssl from the commercial
    vendors. But this is not really true, because all commercial
    alternatives (Raven 1.4.x, Stronghold 3.x, RedHat SWS 2.x, etc.)
    <i>are</i> actually based on mod_ssl and OpenSSL. The reason for
    this common misunderstanding is mainly because some vendors make no
    attempt to make it reasonably clear that their product is actually
    mod_ssl based. So, do not think, just because the commercial
    alternatives are usually more expensive, that you are also receiving
    an alternative <i>technical</i> SSL solution. This is usually not
    the case. Actually the vendor versions of Apache, mod_ssl and OpenSSL
    often stay behind the latest free versions and perhaps this way still do not
    include important bug and security fixes. On the other hand,
    it sometimes occurs that a vendor version includes useful changes
    which are not available through the official freely available
    packages. But most vendors play fair and contribute back those
    changes to the free software world, of course.
    <p>
    So, in short: There are lots of commercial versions of the popular
    Apache+mod_ssl+OpenSSL server combination available. Every user
    should decide carefully whether they really need to buy a commercial
    version or whether it would not be sufficient to directly use the
    free and official versions of the Apache, mod_ssl and OpenSSL
    packages.

    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#what-version"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    That's trivial: mod_ssl uses version strings of the syntax
    <em>&lt;mod_ssl-version&gt;</em>-<em>&lt;apache-version&gt;</em>, for
    instance <code>2.4.0-1.3.9</code>. This directly indicates that it's
    mod_ssl version 2.4.0 for Apache version 1.3.9. And this also means you
    <em>only</em> can apply this mod_ssl version to exactly this Apache
    version (unless you use the <code>--force</code> option to mod_ssl's
    <code>configure</code> command ;-).

Is mod_ssl Year 2000 compliant?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#y2k"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Yes, mod_ssl is Year 2000 compliant.
    <p>
    Because first mod_ssl internally never stores years as two digits.
    Instead it always uses the ANSI C &amp; POSIX numerical data type
    <code>time_t</code> type, which on almost all Unix platforms at the moment
    is a <code>signed long</code> (usually 32-bits) representing seconds since
    epoch of January 1st, 1970, 00:00 UTC. This signed value overflows in
    early January 2038 and not in the year 2000. Second, date and time
    presentations (for instance the variable ``<code>%{TIME_YEAR}</code>'')
    are done with full year value instead of abbreviating to two digits.
    <p>
    Additionally according to a <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#year2000">Year 2000
    statement</a> from the Apache Group, the Apache webserver is Year 2000

    (either a Unix or Win32 platform) is Year 2000 compliant is a different
    question which cannot be answered here.

What about mod_ssl and the Wassenaar Arrangement?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#wassenaar"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    First, let us explain what <i>Wassenaar</i> and it's <i>Arrangement on
    Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and
    Technologies</i> is: This is a international regime, established 1995, to
    control trade in conventional arms and dual-use goods and technology. It
    replaced the previous <i>CoCom</i> regime. 33 countries are signatories:
    Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic,
    Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
    Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic
    of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden,
    Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States. For more
    details look at <a
    href="http://www.wassenaar.org/">http://www.wassenaar.org/</a>.
    <p>
    In short: The aim of the Wassenaar Arrangement is to prevent the build up
    of military capabilities that threaten regional and international security
    and stability. The Wassenaar Arrangement controls the export of
    cryptography as a dual-use good, i.e., one that has both military and
    civilian applications. However, the Wassenaar Arrangement also provides an
    exemption from export controls for mass-market software and free software.
    <p>
    In the current Wassenaar ``<i>List of Dual Use Goods and Technologies And
    Munitions</i>'', under ``<i>GENERAL SOFTWARE NOTE</i>'' (GSN) it says
    ``<i>The Lists do not control "software" which is either: 1. [...] 2. "in
    the public domain".</i>'' And under ``<i>DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN
    THESE LISTS</i>'' one can find the definition: ``<i>"In the public
    domain": This means "technology" or "software" which has been made
    available without restrictions upon its further dissemination. N.B.
    Copyright restrictions do not remove "technology" or "software" from being
    "in the public domain".</i>''
    <p>
    So, both mod_ssl and OpenSSL are ``in the public domain'' for the purposes
    of the Wassenaar Agreement and its ``<i>List of Dual Use Goods and
    Technologies And Munitions List</i>''.
    <p>
    Additionally the Wassenaar Agreement itself has no direct consequence for
    exporting cryptography software. What is actually allowed or forbidden to
    be exported from the countries has still to be defined in the local laws
    of each country. And at least according to official press releases from
    the German BMWi (see <a
    href="http://www.bmwi.de/presse/1998/1208prm2.html">here</a>) and the
    Switzerland Bawi (see <a href="http://jya.com/wass-ch.htm">here</a>) there
    will be no forthcoming export restriction for free cryptography software
    for their countries. Remember that mod_ssl is created in Germany and
    distributed from Switzerland.
    <p>
    So, mod_ssl and OpenSSL are not affected by the Wassenaar Agreement.

    There can be a lot of reasons why a core dump can occur, of course.
    Ranging from buggy third-party modules, over buggy vendor libraries up to
    a buggy mod_ssl version. But the above situation is often caused by old or

    built-in SDBM library (specify <tt>--enable-rule=SSL_SDBM</tt> at the
    APACI command line) or switch from ``<tt>SSLSessionCache dbm:</tt>'' to the

    <p>
    Make sure you add mod_ssl to the Apache source tree first and then do a
    fresh configuration and installation of PHP3. For SSL support EAPI patches
    are required which have to change internal Apache structures. PHP3 needs
    to know about these in order to work correctly. Always make sure that

    This actually means you installed mod_ssl as a DSO, but without rebuilding
    Apache with EAPI. Because EAPI is a requirement for mod_ssl, you need an

    The additional 1MB are caused by the global shared memory pool EAPI
    allocates for all modules and which is not used by mod_ssl for
    various reasons. So the actually allocated shared memory is always
    1MB more than what you specify on <code>SSLSessionCache</code>.
    But don't be confused by the display of `top': although is
    indicates that <i>each</i> process grow, this is not reality, of

</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#entropy"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Cryptographic software needs a source of unpredictable data
    to work correctly. Many open source operating systems provide
    a "randomness device" that serves this purpose (usually named
    <code>/dev/random</code>). On other systems, applications have to
    seed the OpenSSL Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) manually with
    appropriate data before generating keys or performing public key
    encryption. As of version 0.9.5, the OpenSSL functions that need
    randomness report an error if the PRNG has not been seeded with
    at least 128 bits of randomness. So mod_ssl has to provide enough
    entropy to the PRNG to work correctly. For this one has to use the
    <code>SSLRandomSeed</code> directives (to solve the run-time problem)
    and create a <code>$HOME/.rnd</code> file to make sure enough
    entropy is available also for the "<code>make certificate</code>"
    step (in case the "<code>make certificate</code>" procedure is not
    able to gather enough entropy theirself by searching for system
    files).

    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#https-parallel"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Yes, HTTP and HTTPS use different server ports, so there is no direct
    conflict between them. Either run two separate server instances (one binds
    to port 80, the other to port 443) or even use Apache's elegant virtual
    hosting facility where you can easily create two virtual servers which

    is where any HTTPS compliant browser will look by default. You can force

    <code><b>$ telnet localhost 80</b></code><br>
    <code><b>GET / HTTP/1.0</b></code>
    <p>
    for simple testing the HTTP protocol of Apache, it's not such easy for
    HTTPS because of the SSL protocol between TCP and HTTP. But with the
    help of OpenSSL's <code>s_client</code> command you can do a similar
    check even for HTTPS:
    <p>
    <code><b>$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -state -debug</b></code><br>
    <code><b>GET / HTTP/1.0</b></code>
    <p>
    Before the actual HTTP response you receive detailed information about the
    SSL handshake. For a more general command line client which directly
    understands both the HTTP and HTTPS scheme, can perform GET and POST
    methods, can use a proxy, supports byte ranges, etc. you should have a
    look at nifty <a href="http://curl.haxx.nu/">cURL</a>
    tool. With it you can directly check if your Apache is running fine on
    Port 80 and 443 as following:

    <p>
    The RSA private key file is a digital file that you can use to decrypt
    messages sent to you. It has a public component which you distribute (via
    your Certificate file) which allows people to encrypt those messages to
    you. A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a digital file which contains
    your public key and your name. You send the CSR to a Certifying Authority
    (CA) to be converted into a real Certificate. A Certificate contains your
    RSA public key, your name, the name of the CA, and is digitally signed by
    your CA. Browsers that know the CA can verify the signature on that
    Certificate, thereby obtaining your RSA public key. That enables them to
    send messages which only you can decrypt.

    A Certificate does not have to be signed by a public CA. You can use your

    Just use the ``<code>make certificate</code>'' command at the top-level
    directory of the Apache source tree right before installing Apache via

       And you could create a decrypted PEM version (not recommended)
       of this RSA private key via:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.unsecure</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with the server RSA private
       key (output will be PEM formatted):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr</strong></code>
       <p>
       Make sure you enter the FQDN ("Fully Qualified Domain Name") of the
       server when OpenSSL prompts you for the "CommonName", i.e. when you
       generate a CSR for a website which will be later accessed via
       <code>https://www.foo.dom/</code>, enter "www.foo.dom" here.
       You can see the details of this CSR via the command
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ openssl req -noout -text -in server.csr</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>You now have to send this Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to
       a Certifying Authority (CA) for signing. The result is then a real
       Certificate which can be used for Apache. Here you have two options:
       First you can let the CSR sign by a commercial CA like Verisign or
       Thawte. Then you usually have to post the CSR into a web form, pay for
       the signing and await the signed Certificate you then can store into a
       server.crt file. For more information about commercial CAs have a look

       Second you can use your own CA and now have to sign the CSR yourself by
       this CA. Read the next answer in this FAQ on how to sign a CSR with

    <p>
    <li>Now you have two files: <code>server.key</code> and
    <code>server.crt</code>. These now can be used as following inside your

       SSLCertificateFile    /path/to/this/server.crt
       SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/this/server.key
       </pre>
       The <code>server.csr</code> file is no longer needed.

How can I create and use my own Certificate Authority (CA)?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#cert-ownca"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The short answer is to use the <code>CA.sh</code> or <code>CA.pl</code>
    script provided by OpenSSL. The long and manual answer is this:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Create a RSA private key for your CA
       (will be Triple-DES encrypted and PEM formatted):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 1024</strong></code>
       <p>
       Please backup this <code>ca.key</code> file and remember the
       pass-phrase you currently entered at a secure location.
       You can see the details of this RSA private key via the command
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -noout -text -in ca.key</strong></code>
       <p>
       And you can create a decrypted PEM version (not recommended) of this
       private key via:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -in ca.key -out ca.key.unsecure</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Create a self-signed CA Certificate (X509 structure)
       with the RSA key of the CA (output will be PEM formatted):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt</strong></code>
       <p>
       You can see the details of this Certificate via the command:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in ca.crt</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Prepare a script for signing which is needed because
       the ``<code>openssl ca</code>'' command has some strange requirements
       and the default OpenSSL config doesn't allow one easily to use
       ``<code>openssl ca</code>'' directly. So a script named
       <code>sign.sh</code> is distributed with the mod_ssl distribution
       (subdir <code>pkg.contrib/</code>). Use this script for signing.
    <p>
    <li>Now you can use this CA to sign server CSR's in order to create real
       SSL Certificates for use inside an Apache webserver (assuming
       you already have a <code>server.csr</code> at hand):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ./sign.sh server.csr</strong></code>
       <p>
       This signs the server CSR and results in a <code>server.crt</code> file.

How can I change the pass-phrase on my private key file?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#change-passphrase"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    You simply have to read it with the old pass-phrase and write it again
    by specifying the new pass-phrase. You can accomplish this with the following
    commands:
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -des3 -in server.key -out server.key.new</strong></code><br>
    <code><strong>$ mv server.key.new server.key</strong></code><br>
    <p>
    Here you're asked two times for a PEM pass-phrase. At the first
    prompt enter the old pass-phrase and at the second prompt
    enter the new pass-phrase.

How can I get rid of the pass-phrase dialog at Apache startup time?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#remove-passphrase"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The reason why this dialog pops up at startup and every re-start
    is that the RSA private key inside your server.key file is stored in
    encrypted format for security reasons. The pass-phrase is needed to be
    able to read and parse this file. When you can be sure that your server is
    secure enough you perform two steps:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Remove the encryption from the RSA private key (while
       preserving the original file):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ cp server.key server.key.org</strong></code><br>
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Make sure the server.key file is now only readable by root:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ chmod 400 server.key</strong></code>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Now <code>server.key</code> will contain an unencrypted copy of the key.
    If you point your server at this file it will not prompt you for a
    pass-phrase. HOWEVER, if anyone gets this key they will be able to
    impersonate you on the net. PLEASE make sure that the permissions on that
    file are really such that only root or the web server user can read it
    (preferably get your web server to start as root but run as another
    server, and have the key readable only by root).
    <p>
    As an alternative approach you can use the ``<code>SSLPassPhraseDialog
    exec:/path/to/program</code>'' facility. But keep in mind that this is
    neither more nor less secure, of course.

How do I verify that a private key matches its Certificate?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#verify-key"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The private key contains a series of numbers. Two of those numbers form
    the "public key", the others are part of your "private key". The "public
    key" bits are also embedded in your Certificate (we get them from your
    CSR). To check that the public key in your cert matches the public
    portion of your private key, you need to view the cert and the key and
    compare the numbers. To view the Certificate and the key run the
    commands:
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt</strong></code><br>
    <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key</strong></code>
    <p>
    The `modulus' and the `public exponent' portions in the key and the
    Certificate must match. But since the public exponent is usually 65537
    and it's bothering comparing long modulus you can use the following
    approach:
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in server.crt | openssl md5</strong></code><br>
    <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in server.key | openssl md5</strong></code>
    <p>
    And then compare these really shorter numbers. With overwhelming
    probability they will differ if the keys are different. BTW, if I want to
    check to which key or certificate a particular CSR belongs you can compute
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ openssl req -noout -modulus -in server.csr | openssl md5</strong></code>

    logfile, this means that the browser was unable to handle the server

    <p>
    The private key sizes for SSL must be either 512 or 1024 for compatibility
    with certain web browsers. A keysize of 1024 bits is recommended because
    keys larger than 1024 bits are incompatible with some versions of Netscape

    <p>
    The CA certificates under the path you configured with
    <code>SSLCACertificatePath</code> are found by SSLeay through hash
    symlinks. These hash values are generated by the `<code>openssl x509 -noout
    -hash</code>' command. But the algorithm used to calculate the hash for a
    certificate has changed between SSLeay 0.8 and 0.9. So you have to remove
    all old hash symlinks and re-create new ones after upgrading. Use the

    The default certificate format for SSLeay/OpenSSL is PEM, which actually

    format. You can convert a PEM file <code>cert.pem</code> into the

    This is because Verisign has never provided specific instructions

    Yes, mod_ssl since version 2.1 supports the SGC facility. You don't have
    to configure anything special for this, just use a Global ID as your

    <p>
    That is because Verisign uses an intermediate CA certificate between
    the root CA certificate (which is installed in the browsers) and
    the server certificate (which you installed in the server). You
    should have received this additional CA certificate from Verisign.
    If not, complain to them. Then configure this certificate with the
    <code>SSLCertificateChainFile</code> directive in the server. This
    makes sure the intermediate CA certificate is send to the browser

    <p>
    Because SSL uses strong cryptographic encryption and this needs a lot of

    Usually just all SSL ciphers which are supported by the

    In order to use Anonymous Diffie-Hellman (ADH) ciphers, it is not enough
    to just put ``<code>ADH</code>'' into your <code>SSLCipherSuite</code>.
    Additionally you have to build OpenSSL with
    ``<code>-DSSL_ALLOW_ADH</code>''. Because per default OpenSSL does not

    (at least not until you also configure an additional RSA-based
    certificate/key pair). But current browsers like NS or IE only speak
    RSA ciphers. The result is the "no shared ciphers" error. To fix

    <p>
    The reason is very technical. Actually it's some sort of a chicken and
    egg problem: The SSL protocol layer stays below the HTTP protocol layer
    and encapsulates HTTP. When an SSL connection (HTTPS) is established
    Apache/mod_ssl has to negotiate the SSL protocol parameters with the
    client. For this mod_ssl has to consult the configuration of the virtual
    server (for instance it has to look for the cipher suite, the server
    certificate, etc.). But in order to dispatch to the correct virtual server
    Apache has to know the <code>Host</code> HTTP header field. For this the
    HTTP request header has to be read. This cannot be done before the SSL
    handshake is finished. But the information is already needed at the SSL
    handshake phase. Bingo!

    <p>
    No, the username/password is already transmitted encrypted. The icon in
    Netscape browsers is just not really synchronized with the SSL/TLS layer
    (it toggles to the locked state when the first part of the actual webpage
    data is transferred which is not quite correct) and this way confuses
    people. The Basic Authentication facility is part of the HTTP layer and
    this layer is above the SSL/TLS layer in HTTPS. And before any HTTP data
    communication takes place in HTTPS the SSL/TLS layer has already done the
    handshake phase and switched to encrypted communication. So, don't get
    confused by this icon.

    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#io-ie"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The first reason is that the SSL implementation in some MSIE versions has
    some subtle bugs related to the HTTP keep-alive facility and the SSL close
    notify alerts on socket connection close. Additionally the interaction
    between SSL and HTTP/1.1 features are problematic with some MSIE versions,
    too. You've to work-around these problems by forcing
    Apache+mod_ssl+OpenSSL to not use HTTP/1.1, keep-alive connections or
    sending the SSL close notify messages to MSIE clients. This can be done by
    using the following directive in your SSL-aware virtual host section:
    <pre>
    SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" \
             <b>nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
             downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0</b></pre>
    Additionally it is known some MSIE versions have also problems
    with particular ciphers. Unfortunately one cannot workaround these
    bugs only for those MSIE particular clients, because the ciphers
    are already used in the SSL handshake phase. So a MSIE-specific
    <tt>SetEnvIf</tt> doesn't work to solve these problems. Instead one
    has to do more drastic adjustments to the global parameters. But
    before you decide to do this, make sure your clients really have
    problems. If not, do not do this, because it affects all(!) your
    clients, i.e., also your non-MSIE clients.
    <p>
    The next problem is that 56bit export versions of MSIE 5.x browsers have a
    broken SSLv3 implementation which badly interacts with OpenSSL versions
    greater than 0.9.4. You can either accept this and force your clients to
    upgrade their browsers, or you downgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.4 (hmmm), or you
    can decide to workaround it by accepting the drawback that your workaround
    will horribly affect also other browsers:
    <pre>
    SSLProtocol all <b>-SSLv3</b></pre>
    This completely disables the SSLv3 protocol and lets those browsers work.
    But usually this is an even less acceptable workaround. A more reasonable
    workaround is to address the problem more closely and disable only the
    ciphers which cause trouble.
    <pre>
    SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:<b>!EXPORT56</b>:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP</pre>
    This also lets the broken MSIE versions work, but only removes the
    newer 56bit TLS ciphers.
    <p>
    Another problem with MSIE 5.x clients is that they refuse to connect to
    URLs of the form <tt>https://12.34.56.78/</tt> (IP-addresses are used
    instead of the hostname), if the server is using the Server Gated
    Cryptography (SGC) facility. This can only be avoided by using the fully
    qualified domain name (FQDN) of the website in hyperlinks instead, because
    MSIE 5.x has an error in the way it handles the SGC negotiation.
    <p>
    And finally there are versions of MSIE which seem to require that
    an SSL session can be reused (a totally non standard-conforming
    behaviour, of course). Connection with those MSIE versions only work
    if a SSL session cache is used. So, as a work-around, make sure you
    are using a session cache (see <tt>SSLSessionCache</tt> directive).

When I connect via HTTPS to an Apache+mod_ssl server with Netscape Navigator I
get I/O errors and the message "Netscape has encountered bad data from the
server" What's the reason?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#io-ns"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The problem usually is that you had created a new server certificate with
    the same DN, but you had told your browser to accept forever the old
    server certificate. Once you clear the entry in your browser for the old
    certificate, everything usually will work fine. Netscape's SSL
    implementation is correct, so when you encounter I/O errors with Netscape
    Navigator it is most of the time caused by the configured certificates.

    First look inside the F.A.Q. (this text), perhaps your problem is such
    popular that it was already answered a lot of times in the past.
<p>
<li><em>Postings from the modssl-users Support Mailing List</em>
    <a href="http://www.modssl.org/support/">
    http://www.modssl.org/support/</a><br>
    Second search for your problem in one of the existing archives of the

    another user, too.
<p>
<li><em>Problem Reports in the Bug Database</em>

The following lists all support possibilities for mod_ssl, in order of
preference, i.e. start in this order and do not pick the support possibility
you just like most, please.
<p>
<ol>
<li><em>Write a Problem Report into the Bug Database</em><br>
    <a href="http://www.modssl.org/support/bugdb/">
    http://www.modssl.org/support/bugdb/</a><br>
    This is the preferred way of submitting your problem report, because this
    way it gets filed into the bug database (it cannot be lost) <em>and</em>
    send to the modssl-users mailing list (others see the current problems and
    learn from answers).
<p>
<li><em>Write a Problem Report to the modssl-users Support Mailing List</em><br>
    <a href="mailto:modssl-users@modssl.org">
    modssl-users&nbsp;@&nbsp;modssl.org</a><br>
    This is the second way of submitting your problem report. You have to
    subscribe to the list first, but then you can easily discuss your problem
    with both the author and the whole mod_ssl user community.
<p>
<li><em>Write a Problem Report to the author</em><br>
    <a href="mailto:rse@engelschall.com">
    rse&nbsp;@&nbsp;engelschall.com</a><br>
    This is the last way of submitting your problem report. Please avoid this
    in your own interest because the author is really a very busy men. Your
    mail will always be filed to one of his various mail-folders and is
    usually not processed as fast as a posting on modssl-users.

What information and details I've to provide to
the author when writing a bug report?
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#report-details"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
You have to at least always provide the following information:
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Apache, mod_ssl and OpenSSL version information</em><br>
    The mod_ssl version you should really know. For instance, it's the version
    number in the distribution tarball. The Apache version can be determined
    by running ``<code>httpd -v</code>''. The OpenSSL version can be
    determined by running ``<code>openssl version</code>''. Alternatively when
    you have Lynx installed you can run the command ``<code>lynx -mime_header
    http://localhost/ | grep Server</code>'' to determine all information in a
    single step.
<p>
<li><em>The details on how you built and installed Apache+mod_ssl+OpenSSL</em><br>
    For this you can provide a logfile of your terminal session which shows
    the configuration and install steps. Alternatively you can at least
    provide the author with the APACI `<code>configure</code>'' command line
    you used (assuming you used APACI, of course).
<p>
<li><em>In case of core dumps please include a Backtrace</em><br>
    In case your Apache+mod_ssl+OpenSSL should really dumped core please attach
    a stack-frame ``backtrace'' (see the next question on how to get it).
    Without this information the reason for your core dump cannot be found.
    So you have to provide the backtrace, please.
<p>
<li><em>A detailed description of your problem</em><br>
    Don't laugh, I'm totally serious. I already got a lot of problem reports
    where the people not really said what's the actual problem is. So, in your
    own interest (you want the problem be solved, don't you?) include as much
    details as possible, please. But start with the essentials first, of
    course.

    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#core-dumped"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    In general no, at least not unless you provide more details about the code
    location where Apache dumped core. What is usually always required in
    order to help you is a backtrace (see next question). Without this
    information it is mostly impossible to find the problem and help you in
    fixing it.

    [<a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#report-backtrace"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
Follow the following steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have debugging symbols available in at least
    Apache and mod_ssl. On platforms where you use GCC/GDB you have to build
    Apache+mod_ssl with ``<code>OPTIM="-g -ggdb3"</code>'' to achieve this. On
    other platforms at least ``<code>OPTIM="-g"</code>'' is needed.
<p>
<li>Startup the server and try to produce the core-dump. For this you perhaps
    want to use a directive like ``<code>CoreDumpDirectory /tmp</code>'' to
    make sure that the core-dump file can be written. You then should get a
    <code>/tmp/core</code> or <code>/tmp/httpd.core</code> file. When you
    don't get this, try to run your server under an UID != 0 (root), because
    most "current" kernels do not allow a process to dump core after it has
    done a <code>setuid()</code> (unless it does an <code>exec()</code>) for
    security reasons (there can be privileged information left over in
    memory). Additionally you can run ``<code>/path/to/httpd -X</code>''
    manually to force Apache to not fork.
<p>
<li>Analyze the core-dump. For this run ``<code>gdb /path/to/httpd
    /tmp/httpd.core</code>'' or a similar command has to run. In GDB you then
    just have to enter the ``<code>bt</code>'' command and, voila, you get the
    backtrace. For other debuggers consult your local debugger manual. Send
    this backtrace to the author.
</ol>
