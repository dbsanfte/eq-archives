    <h3>A. Background</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="what" name="what"><strong>What is
        Apache?</strong></a> 

        <p>The Apache httpd server</p>

        <ul>
          <li>is a powerful, flexible, HTTP/1.1 compliant web
          server</li>

          <li>implements the latest protocols, including HTTP/1.1
          (RFC2616)</li>

          <li>is highly configurable and extensible with
          third-party modules</li>

          <li>can be customised by writing 'modules' using the
          Apache module API</li>

          <li>provides full source code and comes with an
          unrestrictive license</li>

          <li>runs on Windows NT/9x, Netware 5.x and above, OS/2, and most
          versions of Unix, as well as several other operating
          systems</li>

          <li>is actively being developed</li>

          <li>encourages user feedback through new ideas, bug
          reports and patches</li>

          <li>
            implements many frequently requested features,
            including:<br />
            <br />
             

            <dl>
              <dt>DBM databases for authentication</dt>

              <dd>allows you to easily set up password-protected
              pages with enormous numbers of authorized users,
              without bogging down the server.</dd>

              <dt>Customized responses to errors and problems</dt>

              <dd>Allows you to set up files, or even CGI scripts,
              which are returned by the server in response to
              errors and problems, e.g. setup a script to intercept
              <strong>500 Server Error</strong>s and perform
              on-the-fly diagnostics for both users and
              yourself.</dd>

              <dt>Multiple DirectoryIndex directives</dt>

              <dd>Allows you to say <code>DirectoryIndex index.html
              index.cgi</code>, which instructs the server to
              either send back <code>index.html</code> or run
              <code>index.cgi</code> when a directory URL is
              requested, whichever it finds in the directory.</dd>

              <dt>Unlimited flexible URL rewriting and
              aliasing</dt>

              <dd>Apache has no fixed limit on the numbers of
              Aliases and Redirects which may be declared in the
              config files. In addition, a powerful rewriting
              engine can be used to solve most URL manipulation
              problems.</dd>

              <dt>Content negotiation</dt>

              <dd>i.e. the ability to automatically serve clients
              of varying sophistication and HTML level compliance,
              with documents which offer the best representation of
              information that the client is capable of
              accepting.</dd>

              <dt>Virtual Hosts</dt>

              <dd>A much requested feature, sometimes known as
              multi-homed servers. This allows the server to
              distinguish between requests made to different IP
              addresses or names (mapped to the same machine).
              Apache also offers dynamically configurable
              mass-virtual hosting.</dd>

              <dt>Configurable Reliable Piped Logs</dt>

              <dd>You can configure Apache to generate logs in the
              format that you want. In addition, on most Unix
              architectures, Apache can send log files to a pipe,
              allowing for log rotation, hit filtering, real-time
              splitting of multiple vhosts into separate logs, and
              asynchronous DNS resolving on the fly.</dd>

        <a id="why" name="why"><strong>How and why was Apache
        created?</strong></a> 

        <p>The <a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html">About
        Apache</a> document explains how the Apache project evolved
        from its beginnings as an outgrowth of the NCSA httpd
        project to its current status as one of the fastest, most
        efficient, and most functional web servers in
        existence.</p>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="name" name="name"><strong>Why the name
        "Apache"?</strong></a> 

        <p>A cute name which stuck. Apache is "<strong>A
        PA</strong>t<strong>CH</strong>y server". It was based on
        some existing code and a series of "patch files".</p>

        <p>For many developers it is also a reverent connotation to
        the Native American Indian tribe of Apache, <a
        href="http://www.indians.org/welker/apache.htm">well-known
        for their superior skills in warfare strategy and
        inexhaustible endurance</a>. For more information on the
        Apache Nation, we suggest searching <a
        href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Apache+Nation">Google</a>,

      <li>
        <a id="compare" name="compare"><strong>OK, so how does
        Apache compare to other servers?</strong></a> 

        <p>For an independent assessment, see <a
        href="http://webcompare.internet.com/">Web
        Compare</a>.</p>

        <p>Apache has been shown to be substantially faster, more
        stable, and more feature-full than many other web servers.
        Although certain commercial servers have claimed to surpass
        Apache's speed (it has not been demonstrated that any of
        these "benchmarks" are a good way of measuring WWW server
        speed at any rate), we feel that it is better to have a
        mostly-fast free server than an extremely-fast server that
        costs thousands of dollars. Apache is run on sites that get
        millions of hits per day, and they have experienced no
        performance difficulties.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="tested" name="tested"><strong>How thoroughly tested
        is Apache?</strong></a> 

        <p>Apache is run on over 6 million Internet servers (as of
        February 2000). It has been tested thoroughly by both
        developers and users. The Apache Group maintains rigorous
        standards before releasing new versions of their server,
        and our server runs without a hitch on over one half of all
        WWW servers available on the Internet. When bugs do show
        up, we release patches and new versions as soon as they are
        available.</p>

        plans for Apache?</strong></a> 

        <ul>
          <li>to continue to be an "open source" no-charge-for-use
          HTTP server,</li>

          <li>to keep up with advances in HTTP protocol and web
          developments in general,</li>

      <li>
        <a id="support" name="support"><strong>Whom do I contact
        for support?</strong></a> 

        <p>There is no official support for Apache. None of the
        developers want to be swamped by a flood of trivial
        questions that can be resolved elsewhere. Bug reports and
        suggestions should be sent <em>via</em> <a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">the bug
        report page</a>. Other questions should be directed to the

    <h3>B. General Technical Questions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="what2do" name="what2do"><strong>"Why can't I ...?
        Why won't ... work?" What to do in case of
        problems</strong></a> 

        <p>If you are having trouble with your Apache server
        software, you should take the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Check the errorlog!</strong> 

            <p>Apache tries to be helpful when it encounters a
            problem. In many cases, it will provide some details by
            writing one or messages to the server error log.
            Sometimes this is enough for you to diagnose &amp; fix
            the problem yourself (such as file permissions or the
            like). The default location of the error log is
            <samp>/usr/local/apache/logs/error_log</samp>, but see
            the <a
            href="../mod/core.html#errorlog"><samp>ErrorLog</samp></a>
            directive in your config files for the location on your
            server.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Check the <a
            href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html">FAQ</a>!</strong>
            

            <p>The latest version of the Apache Frequently-Asked
            Questions list can always be found at the main Apache
            web site.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Check the Apache bug database</strong> 

            <p>Most problems that get reported to The Apache Group
            are recorded in the <a
            href="http://bugs.apache.org/">bug database</a>.
            <em><strong>Please</strong> check the existing reports,
            open <strong>and</strong> closed, before adding
            one.</em> If you find that your issue has already been
            reported, please <em>don't</em> add a "me, too" report.
            If the original report isn't closed yet, we suggest
            that you check it periodically. You might also consider
            contacting the original submitter, because there may be
            an email exchange going on about the issue that isn't
            getting recorded in the database.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Ask in a user support group.</strong> 

            <p>A lot of common problems never make it to the bug
            database because there's already high Q&amp;A traffic
            about them in the <a
            href="http://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html">Users
            mailing list</a> or <a
            href="news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix"><samp>comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix</samp></a>
            and related newsgroups. These newsgroups are also
            available via <a
            href="http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.infosystems.www.servers">
            Google</a>. Many Apache users, and some of the developers,
            can be found roaming their virtual halls, so it is suggested
            that you seek wisdom there. The chances are good that
            you'll get a faster answer there than from the bug
            database, even if you <em>don't</em> see your question
            already posted.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>If all else fails, report the problem in the
            bug database</strong> 

            <p>If you've gone through those steps above that are
            appropriate and have obtained no relief, then please
            <em>do</em> let The Apache Group know about the problem
            by <a
            href="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">logging
            a bug report</a>.</p>

            <p>If your problem involves the server crashing and
            generating a core dump, please include a backtrace (if
            possible). As an example,</p>

            <dl>
              <dd><code># cd <em>ServerRoot</em><br />
               # dbx httpd core<br />
               (dbx) where</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>(Substitute the appropriate locations for your
            <samp>ServerRoot</samp> and your <samp>httpd</samp> and
            <samp>core</samp> files. You may have to use
            <code>gdb</code> instead of <code>dbx</code>.)</p>

        <p>NCSA httpd appears to be moving toward adding
        experimental features which are not generally required at
        the moment. Some of the experiments will succeed while
        others will inevitably be dropped. The Apache philosophy is
        to add what's needed as and when it is needed.</p>

        <p>Apache internally never stores years as two digits. On
        the HTTP protocol level RFC1123-style addresses are
        generated which is the only format a HTTP/1.1-compliant
        server should generate. To be compatible with older
        applications Apache recognizes ANSI C's
        <code>asctime()</code> and RFC850-/RFC1036-style date
        formats, too. The <code>asctime()</code> format uses
        four-digit years, but the RFC850 and RFC1036 date formats
        only define a two-digit year. If Apache sees such a date
        with a value less than 70 it assumes that the century is
        <samp>20</samp> rather than <samp>19</samp>.</p>

        <p>Although Apache is Year 2000 compliant, you may still
        get problems if the underlying OS has problems with dates
        past year 2000 (<em>e.g.</em>, OS calls which accept or
        return year numbers). Most (UNIX) systems store dates
        internally as signed 32-bit integers which contain the
        number of seconds since 1<sup>st</sup> January 1970, so the
        magic boundary to worry about is the year 2038 and not
        2000. But modern operating systems shouldn't cause any
        trouble at all.</p>

        <p>Users of Apache 1.2.x should upgrade to a current
        version of Apache 1.3 (see <a
        href="../new_features_1_3.html#misc">year-2000 improvements
        in Apache 1.3</a> for details).</p>

        <a id="submit_patch" name="submit_patch"><strong>How do I
        submit a patch to the Apache Group?</strong></a> 

        <p>The Apache Group encourages patches from outside
        developers. There are 2 main "types" of patches: small
        bugfixes and general improvements. Bugfixes should be
        submitting using the Apache <a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">bug report
        page</a>. Improvements, modifications, and additions should
        follow the instructions below.</p>

        <p>In general, the first course of action is to be a member
        of the <samp>dev@httpd.apache.org</samp> mailing list. This
        indicates to the Group that you are closely following the
        latest Apache developments. Your patch file should be
        generated using either '<code>diff&nbsp;-c</code>' or
        '<code>diff&nbsp;-u</code>' against the latest CVS tree. To
        submit your patch, send email to
        <samp>dev@httpd.apache.org</samp> with a
        <samp>Subject:</samp> line that starts with
        <samp>[PATCH]</samp> and includes a general description of
        the patch. In the body of the message, the patch should be
        clearly described and then included at the end of the
        message. If the patch-file is long, you can note a URL to
        the file instead of the file itself. Use of MIME
        enclosures/attachments should be avoided.</p>

        <p>Be prepared to respond to any questions about your
        patches and possibly defend your code. If your patch
        results in a lot of discussion, you may be asked to submit
        an updated patch that incorporate all changes and
        suggestions.</p>

        <a id="domination" name="domination"><strong>Why has Apache
        stolen my favourite site's Internet address?</strong></a> 

        <p>The simple answer is: "It hasn't." This misconception is
        usually caused by the site in question having migrated to
        the Apache Web server software, but not having migrated the
        site's content yet. When Apache is installed, the default
        page that gets installed tells the Webmaster the
        installation was successful. The expectation is that this
        default page will be replaced with the site's real content.
        If it doesn't, complain to the Webmaster, not to the Apache
        project -- we just make the software and aren't responsible
        for what people do (or don't do) with it.</p>

        <p>The short answer is: "You aren't." Usually when someone
        thinks the Apache site is originating spam, it's because
        they've traced the spam to a Web site, and the Web site
        says it's using Apache. See the <a
        href="#domination">previous FAQ entry</a> for more details
        on this phenomenon.</p>

        <p>No marketing spam originates from the Apache site. The
        only mail that comes from the site goes only to addresses
        that have been <em>requested</em> to receive the mail.</p>

        <a id="regex" name="regex"><strong>What are "regular

        <p>Regular expressions are a way of describing a pattern -
        for example, "all the words that begin with the letter A"
        or "every 10-digit phone number" or even "Every sentence
        with two commas in it, and no capital letter Q". Regular
        expressions (aka "regex"s) are useful in Apache because
        they let you apply certain attributes against collections
        of files or resources in very flexible ways - for example,
        all .gif and .jpg files under any "images" directory could
        be written as /\/images\/.*(jpg|gif)$/.</p>

        <p>The best overview around is probably the one which comes
        with Perl. We implement a simple subset of Perl's regex
        support, but it's still a good way to learn what they mean.
        You can start by going to the <a
        href="http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlre.html">CPAN
        page on regular expressions</a>, and branching out from

      <li>
        <a id="binaries" name="binaries"><b>Why isn't there a
        binary for my platform?</b></a> 

        <p>The developers make sure that the software builds and
        works correctly on the platforms available to them; this
        does <i>not</i> necessarily mean that <i>your</i> platform
        is one of them. In addition, the Apache HTTP server project
        is primarily source oriented, meaning that distributing
        valid and buildable source code is the purpose of a
        release, not making sure that there is a binary package for
        all of the supported platforms.</p>

        <p>If you don't see a kit for your platform listed in the
        binary distribution area (&lt;URL:<a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/">http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/</a>&gt;),
        it means either that the platform isn't available to any of
        the developers, or that they just haven't gotten around to
        preparing a binary for it. As this is a voluntary project,
        they are under no obligation to do so. Users are encouraged
        and expected to build the software themselves.</p>

        <p>The sole exception to these practices is the Windows
        package. Unlike most Unix and Unix-like platforms, Windows
        systems do not come with a bundled software development
        environment, so we <i>do</i> prepare binary kits for
        Windows when we make a release. Again, however, it's a
        voluntary thing and only a limited number of the developers
        have the capability to build the InstallShield package, so
        the Windows release may lag somewhat behind the source
        release. This lag should be no more than a few days at
        most.</p>

    <h3>C. Building Apache</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="bind8.1" name="bind8.1"><strong>Why do I get an
        error about an undefined reference to
        "<samp>__inet_ntoa</samp>" or other <samp>__inet_*</samp>
        symbols?</strong></a> 

        <p>If you have installed <a
        href="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">BIND-8</a> then this is
        normally due to a conflict between your include files and
        your libraries. BIND-8 installs its include files and
        libraries <code>/usr/local/include/</code> and
        <code>/usr/local/lib/</code>, while the resolver that comes
        with your system is probably installed in
        <code>/usr/include/</code> and <code>/usr/lib/</code>. If
        your system uses the header files in
        <code>/usr/local/include/</code> before those in
        <code>/usr/include/</code> but you do not use the new
        resolver library, then the two versions will conflict.</p>

        <p>To resolve this, you can either make sure you use the
        include files and libraries that came with your system or
        make sure to use the new include files and libraries.
        Adding <code>-lbind</code> to the
        <code>EXTRA_LDFLAGS</code> line in your
        <samp>Configuration</samp> file, then re-running
        <samp>Configure</samp>, should resolve the problem. (Apache
        versions 1.2.* and earlier use <code>EXTRA_LFLAGS</code>
        instead.)</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong>As of BIND 8.1.1, the bind
        libraries and files are installed under
        <samp>/usr/local/bind</samp> by default, so you should not
        run into this problem. Should you want to use the bind
        resolvers you'll have to add the following to the
        respective lines:</p>

        <dl>
          <dd><code>EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/bind/include<br />
           EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/bind/lib<br />
           EXTRA_LIBS=-lbind</code></dd>
        </dl>

      <li>
        <a id="cantbuild" name="cantbuild"><strong>Why won't Apache
        compile with my system's <samp>cc</samp>?</strong></a> 

        <p>If the server won't compile on your system, it is
        probably due to one of the following causes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>The <samp>Configure</samp> script doesn't
          recognize your system environment.</strong><br />
           This might be either because it's completely unknown or
          because the specific environment (include files, OS
          version, <em>et cetera</em>) isn't explicitly handled. If
          this happens, you may need to port the server to your OS
          yourself.</li>

          <li><strong>Your system's C compiler is
          garbage.</strong><br />
           Some operating systems include a default C compiler that
          is either not ANSI C-compliant or suffers from other
          deficiencies. The usual recommendation in cases like this
          is to acquire, install, and use <samp>gcc</samp>.</li>

          <li><strong>Your <samp>include</samp> files may be
          confused.</strong><br />
           In some cases, we have found that a compiler
          installation or system upgrade has left the C header
          files in an inconsistent state. Make sure that your
          include directory tree is in sync with the compiler and
          the operating system.</li>

          <li><strong>Your operating system or compiler may be out
          of revision.</strong><br />
           Software vendors (including those that develop operating
          systems) issue new releases for a reason; sometimes to
          add functionality, but more often to fix bugs that have
          been discovered. Try upgrading your compiler and/or your
          operating system.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Apache Group tests the ability to build the server
        on many different platforms. Unfortunately, we can't test
        all of the OS platforms there are. If you have verified
        that none of the above issues is the cause of your problem,
        and it hasn't been reported before, please submit a <a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">problem
        report</a>. Be sure to include <em>complete</em> details,

        complaints about redefinition of "<code>struct
        iovec</code>" when compiling under Linux?</strong></a> 

        <p>This is a conflict between your C library includes and
        your kernel includes. You need to make sure that the
        versions of both are matched properly. There are two
        workarounds, either one will solve the problem:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Remove the definition of <code>struct iovec</code>
          from your C library includes. It is located in
          <code>/usr/include/sys/uio.h</code>.
          <strong>Or,</strong></li>

          <li>Add <code>-DNO_WRITEV</code> to the
          <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS</code> line in your
          <samp>Configuration</samp> and reconfigure/rebuild. This
          hurts performance and should only be used as a last
          resort.</li>

      <li>
        <a id="broken-gcc" name="broken-gcc"><strong>I'm using gcc
        and I get some compilation errors, what is
        wrong?</strong></a> 

        <p>GCC parses your system header files and produces a
        modified subset which it uses for compiling. This behavior
        ties GCC tightly to the version of your operating system.
        So, for example, if you were running IRIX 5.3 when you
        built GCC and then upgrade to IRIX 6.2 later, you will have
        to rebuild GCC. Similarly for Solaris 2.4, 2.5, or 2.5.1
        when you upgrade to 2.6. Sometimes you can type "gcc -v"
        and it will tell you the version of the operating system it
        was built against.</p>

        <p>If you fail to do this, then it is very likely that
        Apache will fail to build. One of the most common errors is
        with <code>readv</code>, <code>writev</code>, or
        <code>uio.h</code>. This is <strong>not</strong> a bug with
        Apache. You will need to re-install GCC.</p>

        <p>Your <a
        href="../mod/core.html#group"><samp>Group</samp></a>
        directive (probably in <samp>conf/httpd.conf</samp>) needs
        to name a group that actually exists in the
        <samp>/etc/group</samp> file (or your system's equivalent).
        This problem is also frequently seen when a negative number
        is used in the <code>Group</code> directive (<em>e.g.</em>,
        "<code>Group&nbsp;#-1</code>"). Using a group name -- not
        group number -- found in your system's group database
        should solve this problem in all cases.</p>

        <p>This message almost always indicates that the client
        disconnected before Apache reached the point of calling
        <code>setsockopt()</code> for the connection. It shouldn't
        occur for more than about 1% of the requests your server

        log?</strong></a> 

        <p>This is a normal message and nothing about which to be
        alarmed. It simply means that the client canceled the
        connection before it had been completely set up - such as
        by the end-user pressing the "Stop" button. People's
        patience being what it is, sites with response-time
        problems or slow network links may experiences this more
        than high-capacity ones or those with large pipes to the
        network.</p>

        <p>In Apache version 1.2, the error log message about
        dumped core includes the directory where the dump file
        should be located. However, many Unixes do not allow a
        process that has called <code>setuid()</code> to dump core
        for security reasons; the typical Apache setup has the
        server started as root to bind to port 80, after which it
        changes UIDs to a non-privileged user to serve
        requests.</p>

        <p>Dealing with this is extremely operating
        system-specific, and may require rebuilding your system
        kernel. Consult your operating system documentation or
        vendor for more information about whether your system does
        this and how to bypass it. If there <em>is</em> a
        documented way of bypassing it, it is recommended that you
        bypass it only for the <samp>httpd</samp> server process if
        possible.</p>

        <p>The canonical location for Apache's core-dump files is
        the <a href="../mod/core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</a>

        <p>Your kernel has been built without SysV IPC support. You
        will have to rebuild the kernel with that support enabled
        (it's under the "General Setup" submenu). Documentation for
        kernel building is beyond the scope of this FAQ; you should
        consult the <a
        href="http://www.redhat.com/mirrors/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">
        Kernel HOWTO</a>, or the documentation provided with your
        distribution, or a <a
        href="http://www.redhat.com/mirrors/LDP/HOWTO/META-FAQ.html">
        Linux newsgroup/mailing list</a>. As a last-resort
        workaround, you can comment out the
        <code>#define&nbsp;USE_SHMGET_SCOREBOARD</code> definition
        in the <samp>LINUX</samp> section of
        <samp>src/conf.h</samp> and rebuild the server (prior to
        1.3b4, simply removing
        <code>#define&nbsp;HAVE_SHMGET</code> would have sufficed).
        This will produce a server which is slower and less
        reliable.</p>

        <p>These are symptoms of a fine locking problem, which
        usually means that the server is trying to use a
        synchronization file on an NFS filesystem.</p>

        <p>Because of its parallel-operation model, the Apache Web
        server needs to provide some form of synchronization when
        accessing certain resources. One of these synchronization
        methods involves taking out locks on a file, which means
        that the filesystem whereon the lockfile resides must
        support locking. In many cases this means it <em>can't</em>
        be kept on an NFS-mounted filesystem.</p>

        <p>To cause the Web server to work around the NFS locking
        limitations, include a line such as the following in your
        server configuration files:</p>

        <dl>
          <dd><code>LockFile /var/run/apache-lock</code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>RedHat Linux versions 4.x (and possibly earlier) RPMs
        contain various nasty scripts which do not stop or restart
        Apache properly. These can affect you even if you're not
        running the RedHat supplied RPMs.</p>

        <p>If you're using the default install then you're probably
        running Apache 1.1.3, which is outdated. From RedHat's ftp
        site you can pick up a more recent RPM for Apache 1.2.x.
        This will solve one of the problems.</p>

        <p>If you're using a custom built Apache rather than the
        RedHat RPMs then you should <code>rpm -e apache</code>. In
        particular you want the mildly broken
        <code>/etc/logrotate.d/apache</code> script to be removed,
        and you want the broken <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd</code>
        (or <code>httpd.init</code>) script to be removed. The
        latter is actually fixed by the apache-1.2.5 RPMs but if
        you're building your own Apache then you probably don't
        want the RedHat files.</p>

        <p>We can't stress enough how important it is for folks,
        <em>especially vendors</em> to follow the <a
        href="../stopping.html">stopping Apache directions</a>
        given in our documentation. In RedHat's defense, the broken
        scripts were necessary with Apache 1.1.x because the Linux
        support in 1.1.x was very poor, and there were various race
        conditions on all platforms. None of this should be
        necessary with Apache 1.2 and later.</p>

        <p>You should read <a href="#redhat">the previous note</a>
        about problems with RedHat installations. It is entirely
        likely that your installation has start/stop/restart
        scripts which were built for an earlier version of Apache.
        Versions earlier than 1.2.0 had various race conditions

        <p>Short answer: You need to install Winsock 2, available

        href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/">http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/</a></p>

        <p>Detailed answer: Prior to version 1.3.9, Apache for
        Windows used Winsock 1.1. Beginning with version 1.3.9,
        Apache began using Winsock 2 features (specifically,
        WSADuplicateSocket()). WS2_32.DLL implements the Winsock 2
        API. Winsock 2 ships with Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98.
        Some of the earlier releases of Windows 95 did not include
        Winsock 2.</p>

        type of object referenced: Parent: WSADuplicateSocket
        failed for socket ###</samp>". What does this mean?</b></a>
        

        <p>We have seen this problem when Apache is run on systems
        along with Virtual Private Networking clients like Aventail
        Connect. Aventail Connect is a Layered Service Provider
        (LSP) that inserts itself, as a "shim," between the Winsock
        2 API and Window's native Winsock 2 implementation. The
        Aventail Connect shim does not implement
        WSADuplicateSocket, which is the cause of the failure.</p>

        <p>The shim is not unloaded when Aventail Connect is shut
        down. Once observed, the problem persists until the shim is
        either explicitly unloaded or the machine is rebooted.
        Instructions for temporarily removing the Aventail Connect
        V3.x shim can be found here: "<a
        href="http://support.aventail.com/akb/article00386.html">How
        to Remove Aventail Connect v3.x from the LSP Order for
        Testing Purposes</a>."</p>

        <p>Another potential solution (not tested) is to add
        <code>apache.exe</code> to the Aventail "Connect Exclusion
        List". See this link for details: "<a
        href="http://support.aventail.com/akb/article00586.html">How

        <p>Apache is affected in a similar way by <em>any</em>
        firewall program that isn't correctly configured. Assure
        you exclude your Apache server ports (usually port 80) from
        the list of ports to block. Refer to your firewall
        program's documentation for the how-to.</p>

    <h3>E. Configuration Questions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="fdlim" name="fdlim"><strong>Why can't I run more
        than &lt;<em>n</em>&gt; virtual hosts?</strong></a> 

        <p>You are probably running into resource limitations in
        your operating system. The most common limitation is the
        <em>per</em>-process limit on <strong>file
        descriptors</strong>, which is almost always the cause of
        problems seen when adding virtual hosts. Apache often does
        not give an intuitive error message because it is normally
        some library routine (such as <code>gethostbyname()</code>)
        which needs file descriptors and doesn't complain
        intelligibly when it can't get them.</p>

        <p>Each log file requires a file descriptor, which means
        that if you are using separate access and error logs for
        each virtual host, each virtual host needs two file
        descriptors. Each <a
        href="../mod/core.html#listen"><samp>Listen</samp></a>
        directive also needs a file descriptor.</p>

        <p>Typical values for &lt;<em>n</em>&gt; that we've seen
        are in the neighborhood of 128 or 250. When the server
        bumps into the file descriptor limit, it may dump core with
        a SIGSEGV, it might just hang, or it may limp along and
        you'll see (possibly meaningful) errors in the error log.
        One common problem that occurs when you run into a file
        descriptor limit is that CGI scripts stop being executed
        properly.</p>

        <p>As to what you can do about this:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Reduce the number of <a
          href="../mod/core.html#listen"><samp>Listen</samp></a>
          directives. If there are no other servers running on the
          machine on the same port then you normally don't need any
          Listen directives at all. By default Apache listens to
          all addresses on port 80.</li>

          <li>Reduce the number of log files. You can use <a
          href="../mod/mod_log_config.html"><samp>mod_log_config</samp></a>
          to log all requests to a single log file while including
          the name of the virtual host in the log file. You can
          then write a script to split the logfile into separate
          files later if necessary. Such a script is provided with
          the Apache 1.3 distribution in the
          <samp>src/support/split-logfile</samp> file.</li>

          <li>
            Increase the number of file descriptors available to
            the server (see your system's documentation on the
            <code>limit</code> or <code>ulimit</code> commands).
            For some systems, information on how to do this is
            available in the <a href="perf.html">performance
            hints</a> page. There is a specific note for <a
            href="#freebsd-setsize">FreeBSD</a> below. 

            <p>For Windows 95, try modifying your
            <samp>C:\CONFIG.SYS</samp> file to include a line
            like</p>

            <dl>
              <dd><code>FILES=300</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>Remember that you'll need to reboot your Windows 95
            system in order for the new value to take effect.</p>
          </li>

          <li>"Don't do that" - try to run with fewer virtual
          hosts</li>

          <li>Spread your operation across multiple server
          processes (using <a
          href="../mod/core.html#listen"><samp>Listen</samp></a>
          for example, but see the first point) and/or ports.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Since this is an operating-system limitation, there's
        not much else available in the way of solutions.</p>

        <p>As of 1.2.1 we have made attempts to work around various
        limitations involving running with many descriptors. <a

        <p>On versions of FreeBSD before 3.0, the
        <samp>FD_SETSIZE</samp> define defaults to 256. This means
        that you will have trouble usefully using more than 256
        file descriptors in Apache. This can be increased, but
        doing so can be tricky.</p>

        <p>If you are using a version prior to 2.2, you need to
        recompile your kernel with a larger
        <samp>FD_SETSIZE</samp>. This can be done by adding a line
        such as:</p>

        <dl>
          <dd><code>options FD_SETSIZE <em>nnn</em></code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>to your kernel config file. Starting at version 2.2,
        this is no longer necessary.</p>

        <p>If you are using a version of 2.1-stable from after
        1997/03/10 or 2.2 or 3.0-current from before 1997/06/28,
        there is a limit in the resolver library that prevents it
        from using more file descriptors than what
        <samp>FD_SETSIZE</samp> is set to when libc is compiled. To
        increase this, you have to recompile libc with a higher
        <samp>FD_SETSIZE</samp>.</p>

        <p>In FreeBSD 3.0, the default <samp>FD_SETSIZE</samp> has
        been increased to 1024 and the above limitation in the
        resolver library has been removed.</p>

        <p>After you deal with the appropriate changes above, you
        can increase the setting of <samp>FD_SETSIZE</samp> at

        <p>Firstly, you do <em>not</em> need to compile in
        <samp>mod_cookies</samp> in order for your scripts to work
        (see the <a href="#cookies1">previous question</a> for more

        script does not work properly or your browser does not use
        cookies or is not set-up to accept them.</p>

        give me plain text when I request an URL from an Apache
        server?</strong></a> 

        <p>As of version 1.2, Apache is an HTTP/1.1 (HyperText
        Transfer Protocol version 1.1) server. This fact is
        reflected in the protocol version that's included in the
        response headers sent to a client when processing a
        request. Unfortunately, low-level Web access classes
        included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.0.2
        expect to see the version string "HTTP/1.0" and do not
        correctly interpret the "HTTP/1.1" value Apache is sending
        (this part of the response is a declaration of what the
        server can do rather than a declaration of the dialect of
        the response). The result is that the JDK methods do not
        correctly parse the headers, and include them with the
        document content by mistake.</p>

        <p>This is definitely a bug in the JDK 1.0.2 foundation
        classes from Sun, and it has been fixed in version 1.1.
        However, the classes in question are part of the virtual
        machine environment, which means they're part of the Web
        browser (if Java-enabled) or the Java environment on the
        client system - so even if you develop <em>your</em>
        classes with a recent JDK, the eventual users might
        encounter the problem. The classes involved are replaceable
        by vendors implementing the Java virtual machine
        environment, and so even those that are based upon the
        1.0.2 version may not have this problem.</p>

        <p>In the meantime, a workaround is to tell Apache to
        "fake" an HTTP/1.0 response to requests that come from the
        JDK methods; this can be done by including a line such as
        the following in your server configuration files:</p>

        <dl>
          <dd><code>BrowserMatch Java1.0 force-response-1.0<br />
           BrowserMatch JDK/1.0 force-response-1.0</code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Even though the registered MIME type for MIDI files is
        <samp>audio/midi</samp>, some browsers are not set up to
        recognize it as such; instead, they look for
        <samp>audio/x-midi</samp>. There are two things you can do
        to address this:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Configure your browser to treat documents of type
          <samp>audio/midi</samp> correctly. This is the type that
          Apache sends by default. This may not be workable,
          however, if you have many client installations to change,
          or if some or many of the clients are not under your
          control.</li>

          <li>
            Instruct Apache to send a different
            <samp>Content-type</samp> header for these files by
            adding the following line to your server's
            configuration files: 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>AddType audio/x-midi .mid .midi
              .kar</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>Note that this may break browsers that <em>do</em>
            recognize the <samp>audio/midi</samp> MIME type unless
            they're prepared to also handle
            <samp>audio/x-midi</samp> the same way.</p>

        <a id="addlog" name="addlog"><strong>How do I add browsers

        <p>Apache provides a couple of different ways of doing
        this. The recommended method is to compile the <a
        href="../mod/mod_log_config.html"><samp>mod_log_config</samp></a>
        module into your configuration and use the <a
        href="../mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog"><samp>CustomLog</samp></a>
        directive.</p>

        <p>You can either log the additional information in files
        other than your normal transfer log, or you can add them to
        the records already being written. For example:</p>

        <p>
        <code>CustomLog&nbsp;logs/access_log&nbsp;"%h&nbsp;%l&nbsp;%u&nbsp;%t&nbsp;\"%r\"&nbsp;%s&nbsp;%b&nbsp;\"%{Referer}i\"&nbsp;\"%{User-Agent}i\""</code></p>

        <p>This will add the values of the <samp>User-agent:</samp>
        and <samp>Referer:</samp> headers, which indicate the
        client and the referring page, respectively, to the end of
        each line in the access log.</p>

        does accessing directories only work when I include the

        but not when I omit it
        (<em>e.g.</em>,&nbsp;<samp>http://foo.domain.com/~user</samp>)?</strong></a>
        

        <p>When you access a directory without a trailing "/",
        Apache needs to send what is called a redirect to the
        client to tell it to add the trailing slash. If it did not
        do so, relative URLs would not work properly. When it sends
        the redirect, it needs to know the name of the server so
        that it can include it in the redirect. There are two ways
        for Apache to find this out; either it can guess, or you
        can tell it. If your DNS is configured correctly, it can
        normally guess without any problems. If it is not, however,
        then you need to tell it.</p>

        <p>Add a <a

        <p>The <a
        href="../mod/mod_info.html"><samp>mod_info</samp></a>
        module allows you to use a Web browser to see how your

        the list modules and their configuration directives. The
        "current" values for the directives are not necessarily
        those of the running server; they are extracted from the
        configuration files themselves at the time of the request.
        If the files have been changed since the server was last
        reloaded, the display will not match the values actively in
        use. If the files and the path to the files are not
        readable by the user as which the server is running (see
        the <a href="../mod/core.html#user"><samp>User</samp></a>

        Apache 1.3 and now my virtual hosts don't
        work!</strong></a> 

        <p>In versions of Apache prior to 1.3b2, there was a lot of
        confusion regarding address-based virtual hosts and
        (HTTP/1.1) name-based virtual hosts, and the rules
        concerning how the server processed
        <samp>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</samp> definitions were very
        complex and not well documented.</p>

        <p>Apache 1.3b2 introduced a new directive, <a
        href="../mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><samp>NameVirtualHost</samp></a>,
        which simplifies the rules quite a bit. However, changing
        the rules like this means that your existing name-based
        <samp>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</samp> containers probably won't
        work correctly immediately following the upgrade.</p>

        <p>To correct this problem, add the following line to the
        beginning of your server configuration file, before
        defining any virtual hosts:</p>

        <dl>
          <dd><code>NameVirtualHost <em>n.n.n.n</em></code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Replace the "<samp>n.n.n.n</samp>" with the IP address
        to which the name-based virtual host names resolve; if you
        have multiple name-based hosts on multiple addresses,
        repeat the directive for each address.</p>

        <p>Make sure that your name-based
        <samp>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</samp> blocks contain
        <samp>ServerName</samp> and possibly
        <samp>ServerAlias</samp> directives so Apache can be sure
        to tell them apart correctly.</p>

        <p>MS Internet Explorer (MSIE) and Netscape handle mime type
        detection in different ways, and therefore will display the
        document differently. In particular, IE sometimes relies on
        the file extension or the contents of the file to determine
        the mime type. This can happen when the server specifies a
        mime type of <code>application/octet-stream</code> or
        <code>text/plain</code>.  This behavior violates the the HTTP
        standard and makes it impossible to deliver plain text
        documents to MSIE clients in some cases.  More details are
        available on MSIE's mime type detection behavior in an <a
        href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/networking/moniker/overview/appendix_a.asp">
        MSDN article</a> and a <a
        href="http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/www/content-type.html">note</a>
        by Alan J. Flavell.</p>

        <p>The best you can do as a server administrator is to
        accurately configure the mime type of your documents by editing
        the <code>mime.types</code> file or using an <a
        href="../mod/mod_mime.html#addtype"><code>AddType</code></a>
        directive in the Apache configuration files.  In some cases,
        you may be able to fool MSIE into rendering text/plain documents
        correctly by assuring they have a <code>.txt</code> filename
        extension, but this will not work if MSIE thinks the content
        looks like another file type.

        For example, <code>www.example.com</code>,

        as being eligible for execution rather than processing as
        normal documents. This applies regardless of the file name,
        so scripts in a ScriptAlias directory don't need to be
        named "<samp>*.cgi</samp>" or "<samp>*.pl</samp>" or
        whatever. In other words, <em>all</em> files in a
        ScriptAlias directory are scripts, as far as Apache is
        concerned.</p>

        <p>To persuade Apache to execute scripts in other
        locations, such as in directories where normal documents
        may also live, you must tell it how to recognize them - and
        also that it's okay to execute them. For this, you need to
        use something like the <a
        href="../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler"><samp>AddHandler</samp></a>
        directive.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            In an appropriate section of your server configuration
            files, add a line such as 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>AddHandler cgi-script .cgi</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>The server will then recognize that all files in
            that location (and its logical descendants) that end in
            "<samp>.cgi</samp>" are script files, not
            documents.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Make sure that the directory location is covered by
          an <a
          href="../mod/core.html#options"><samp>Options</samp></a>
          declaration that includes the <samp>ExecCGI</samp>
          option.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In some situations, you might not want to actually allow
        all files named "<samp>*.cgi</samp>" to be executable.
        Perhaps all you want is to enable a particular file in a
        normal directory to be executable. This can be
        alternatively accomplished <em>via</em> <a
        href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html"><samp>mod_rewrite</samp></a>
        and the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Locally add to the corresponding <samp>.htaccess</samp>
            file a ruleset similar to this one: 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>RewriteEngine on<br />
               RewriteBase /~foo/bar/<br />
               RewriteRule ^quux\.cgi$ -
              [T=application/x-httpd-cgi]</code></dd>
            </dl>
          </li>

          <li>Make sure that the directory location is covered by
          an <a
          href="../mod/core.html#options"><samp>Options</samp></a>
          declaration that includes the <samp>ExecCGI</samp> and
          <samp>FollowSymLinks</samp> option.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="premature-script-headers"
        name="premature-script-headers"><strong>What does it mean
        when my CGIs fail with "<samp>Premature end of script
        headers</samp>"?</strong></a> 

        <p>It means just what it says: the server was expecting a
        complete set of HTTP headers (one or more followed by a
        blank line), and didn't get them.</p>

        <p>The most common cause of this problem is the script
        dying before sending the complete set of headers, or
        possibly any at all, to the server. To see if this is the
        case, try running the script standalone from an interactive
        session, rather than as a script under the server. If you
        get error messages, this is almost certainly the cause of
        the "premature end of script headers" message. Even if the
        CGI runs fine from the command line, remember that the
        environment and permissions may be different when running
        under the web server. The CGI can only access resources
        allowed for the <a
        href="../mod/core.html#user"><code>User</code></a> and <a
        href="../mod/core.html#group"><code>Group</code></a>
        specified in your Apache configuration. In addition, the
        environment will not be the same as the one provided on the
        command line, but it can be adjusted using the directives
        provided by <a href="../mod/mod_env.html">mod_env</a>.</p>

        <p>The second most common cause of this (aside from people
        not outputting the required headers at all) is a result of
        an interaction with Perl's output buffering. To make Perl
        flush its buffers after each output statement, insert the
        following statements around the <code>print</code> or
        <code>write</code> statements that send your HTTP
        headers:</p>

        <dl>
          <dd><code>{<br />
           &nbsp;local ($oldbar) = $|;<br />
           &nbsp;$cfh = select (STDOUT);<br />
           &nbsp;$| = 1;<br />
           &nbsp;#<br />
           &nbsp;# print your HTTP headers here<br />
           &nbsp;#<br />
           &nbsp;$| = $oldbar;<br />
           &nbsp;select ($cfh);<br />
           }</code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>This is generally only necessary when you are calling
        external programs from your script that send output to
        stdout, or if there will be a long delay between the time
        the headers are sent and the actual content starts being
        emitted. To maximize performance, you should turn
        buffer-flushing back <em>off</em> (with <code>$| = 0</code>
        or the equivalent) after the statements that send the
        headers, as displayed above.</p>

        <p>If your script isn't written in Perl, do the equivalent
        thing for whatever language you <em>are</em> using
        (<em>e.g.</em>, for C, call <code>fflush()</code> after
        writing the headers).</p>

        <p>Another cause for the "premature end of script headers"
        message are the RLimitCPU and RLimitMEM directives. You may
        get the message if the CGI script was killed due to a
        resource limit.</p>

        <p>In addition, a configuration problem in <a
        href="../suexec.html">suEXEC</a>, mod_perl, or another
        third party module can often interfere with the execution
        of your CGI and cause the "premature end of script headers"
        message.</p>

        <p>This is almost always due to Apache not being configured

        script. You can not POST to a normal HTML file; the
        operation has no meaning. See the FAQ entry on <a

        <p>As of Apache 1.3, CGI scripts are essentially not
        buffered. Every time your script does a "flush" to output
        data, that data gets relayed on to the client. Some
        scripting languages, for example Perl, have their own
        buffering for output - this can be disabled by setting the
        <code>$|</code> special variable to 1. Of course this does
        increase the overall number of packets being transmitted,
        which can result in a sense of slowness for the end
        user.</p>

        <p>Prior to 1.3, you needed to use "nph-" scripts to
        accomplish non-buffering. Today, the only difference
        between nph scripts and normal scripts is that nph scripts
        require the full HTTP headers to be sent.</p>

        <a id="ssi-part-i" name="ssi-part-i"><strong>How do I
        enable SSI (parsed HTML)?</strong></a> 

        <p>SSI (an acronym for Server-Side Include) directives
        allow static HTML documents to be enhanced at run-time
        (<em>e.g.</em>, when delivered to a client by Apache). The
        format of SSI directives is covered in the <a
        href="../mod/mod_include.html">mod_include manual</a>;
        suffice it to say that Apache supports not only SSI but
        xSSI (eXtended SSI) directives.</p>

        <p>Processing a document at run-time is called
        <em>parsing</em> it; hence the term "parsed HTML" sometimes
        used for documents that contain SSI instructions. Parsing
        tends to be resource-consumptive compared to serving static
        files, and is not enabled by default. It can also interfere
        with the cachability of your documents, which can put a
        further load on your server. (See the <a
        href="#ssi-part-ii">next question</a> for more information
        about this.)</p>

        <p>To enable SSI processing, you need to</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Build your server with the <a
          href="../mod/mod_include.html"><samp>mod_include</samp></a>
          module. This is normally compiled in by default.</li>

          <li>Make sure your server configuration files have an <a
          href="../mod/core.html#options"><samp>Options</samp></a>
          directive which permits <samp>Includes</samp>.</li>

          <li>
            Make sure that the directory where you want the SSI
            documents to live is covered by the "server-parsed"
            content handler, either explicitly or in some ancestral
            location. That can be done with the following <a
            href="../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler"><samp>AddHandler</samp></a>
            directive: 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>AddHandler server-parsed .shtml</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>This indicates that all files ending in ".shtml" in
            that location (or its descendants) should be parsed.
            Note that using ".html" will cause all normal HTML
            files to be parsed, which may put an inordinate load on
            your server.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For additional information, see the <cite>Apache
        Week</cite> article on <a

        <a id="ssi-part-ii" name="ssi-part-ii"><strong>Why don't my
        parsed files get cached?</strong></a> 

        <p>Since the server is performing run-time processing of
        your SSI directives, which may change the content shipped
        to the client, it can't know at the time it starts parsing
        what the final size of the result will be, or whether the
        parsed result will always be the same. This means that it
        can't generate <samp>Content-Length</samp> or
        <samp>Last-Modified</samp> headers. Caches commonly work by
        comparing the <samp>Last-Modified</samp> of what's in the
        cache with that being delivered by the server. Since the
        server isn't sending that header for a parsed document,
        whatever's doing the caching can't tell whether the
        document has changed or not - and so fetches it again to be
        on the safe side.</p>

        <p>You can work around this in some cases by causing an
        <samp>Expires</samp> header to be generated. (See the <a
        href="../mod/mod_expires.html"
        rel="Help"><samp>mod_expires</samp></a> documentation for
        more details.) Another possibility is to use the <a
        href="../mod/mod_include.html#xbithack"
        rel="Help"><samp>XBitHack Full</samp></a> mechanism, which
        tells Apache to send (under certain circumstances detailed
        in the XBitHack directive description) a
        <samp>Last-Modified</samp> header based upon the last
        modification time of the file being parsed. Note that this
        may actually be lying to the client if the parsed file
        doesn't change but the SSI-inserted content does; if the
        included content changes often, this can result in stale
        copies being cached.</p>

        <a id="ssi-part-iii" name="ssi-part-iii"><strong>How can I

        <p>So you want to include SSI directives in the output from
        your CGI script, but can't figure out how to do it? The
        short answer is "you can't." This is potentially a security
        liability and, more importantly, it can not be cleanly
        implemented under the current server API. The best
        workaround is for your script itself to do what the SSIs
        would be doing. After all, it's generating the rest of the
        content.</p>

    <h3>G. Authentication and Access Restrictions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="dnsauth" name="dnsauth"><strong>Why isn't
        restricting access by host or domain name working
        correctly?</strong></a> 

        <p>Two of the most common causes of this are:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>An error, inconsistency, or unexpected
          mapping in the DNS registration</strong><br />
           This happens frequently: your configuration restricts
          access to <samp>Host.FooBar.Com</samp>, but you can't get
          in from that host. The usual reason for this is that
          <samp>Host.FooBar.Com</samp> is actually an alias for
          another name, and when Apache performs the
          address-to-name lookup it's getting the <em>real</em>
          name, not <samp>Host.FooBar.Com</samp>. You can verify
          this by checking the reverse lookup yourself. The easiest
          way to work around it is to specify the correct host name
          in your configuration.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>Inadequate checking and verification in your
            configuration of Apache</strong><br />
             If you intend to perform access checking and
            restriction based upon the client's host or domain
            name, you really need to configure Apache to
            double-check the origin information it's supplied. You
            do this by adding the <samp>-DMAXIMUM_DNS</samp> clause

            <p>This will cause Apache to be very paranoid about
            making sure a particular host address is
            <em>really</em> assigned to the name it claims to be.
            Note that this <em>can</em> incur a significant
            performance penalty, however, because of all the name
            resolution requests being sent to a nameserver.</p>

        popular ones are to use the <a

        <p>Use the <a href="../mod/core.html#satisfy">Satisfy</a>

        directive, to require that only one of the access

        <a id="authauthoritative"
        name="authauthoritative"><strong>Why does my authentication
        give me a server error?</strong></a> 

        <p>Under normal circumstances, the Apache access control
        modules will pass unrecognized user IDs on to the next
        access control module in line. Only if the user ID is
        recognized and the password is validated (or not) will it
        give the usual success or "authentication failed"
        messages.</p>

        <p>However, if the last access module in line 'declines'
        the validation request (because it has never heard of the
        user ID or because it is not configured), the
        <samp>http_request</samp> handler will give one of the
        following, confusing, errors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><samp>check access</samp></li>

          <li><samp>check user. No user file?</samp></li>

          <li><samp>check access. No groups file?</samp></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This does <em>not</em> mean that you have to add an
        '<samp>AuthUserFile&nbsp;/dev/null</samp>' line as some
        magazines suggest!</p>

        <p>The solution is to ensure that at least the last module
        is authoritative and <strong>CONFIGURED</strong>. By
        default, <samp>mod_auth</samp> is authoritative and will
        give an OK/Denied, but only if it is configured with the
        proper <samp>AuthUserFile</samp>. Likewise, if a valid
        group is required. (Remember that the modules are processed
        in the reverse order from that in which they appear in your
        compile-time <samp>Configuration</samp> file.)</p>

        <p>A typical situation for this error is when you are using
        the <samp>mod_auth_dbm</samp>, <samp>mod_auth_msql</samp>,
        <samp>mod_auth_mysql</samp>, <samp>mod_auth_anon</samp> or
        <samp>mod_auth_cookie</samp> modules on their own. These
        are by default <strong>not</strong> authoritative, and this
        will pass the buck on to the (non-existent) next
        authentication module when the user ID is not in their
        respective database. Just add the appropriate
        '<samp><em>XXX</em>Authoritative yes</samp>' line to the
        configuration.</p>

        <p>In general it is a good idea (though not terribly
        efficient) to have the file-based <samp>mod_auth</samp> a
        module of last resort. This allows you to access the web
        server with a few special passwords even if the databases
        are down or corrupted. This does cost a file
        open/seek/close for each request in a protected area.</p>

        <p>Some organizations feel very strongly about keeping the

        authentication?</strong></a> 

        <p>Yes, you can - but it's a <strong>very bad
        idea</strong>. Here are some of the reasons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Web technology provides no governors on how often
          or how rapidly password (authentication failure) retries
          can be made. That means that someone can hammer away at
          your system's <samp>root</samp> password using the Web,
          using a dictionary or similar mass attack, just as fast
          as the wire and your server can handle the requests. Most
          operating systems these days include attack detection
          (such as <em>n</em> failed passwords for the same account
          within <em>m</em> seconds) and evasion (breaking the
          connection, disabling the account under attack, disabling
          <em>all</em> logins from that source, <em>et
          cetera</em>), but the Web does not.</li>

          <li>An account under attack isn't notified (unless the
          server is heavily modified); there's no "You have 19483
          login failures" message when the legitimate owner logs
          in.</li>

          <li>Without an exhaustive and error-prone examination of
          the server logs, you can't tell whether an account has
          been compromised. Detecting that an attack has occurred,
          or is in progress, is fairly obvious, though -
          <em>if</em> you look at the logs.</li>

          <li>Web authentication passwords (at least for Basic
          authentication) generally fly across the wire, and
          through intermediate proxy systems, in what amounts to
          plain text. "O'er the net we go/Caching all the way;/O
          what fun it is to surf/Giving my password away!"</li>

          <li>Since HTTP is stateless, information about the
          authentication is transmitted <em>each and every
          time</em> a request is made to the server. Essentially,
          the client caches it after the first successful access,
          and transmits it without asking for all subsequent
          requests to the same server.</li>

          <li>It's relatively trivial for someone on your system to
          put up a page that will steal the cached password from a
          client's cache without them knowing. Can you say
          "password grabber"?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you still want to do this in light of the above
        disadvantages, the method is left as an exercise for the
        reader. It'll void your Apache warranty, though, and you'll
        lose all accumulated UNIX guru points.</p>

        <a id="prompted-twice" name="prompted-twice"><strong>Why
        does Apache ask for my password twice before serving a

        <p>If the hostname under which you are accessing the server
        is different than the hostname specified in the <a
        href="../mod/core.html#servername"><code>ServerName</code></a>
        directive, then depending on the setting of the <a
        href="../mod/core.html#usecanonicalname"><code>UseCanonicalName</code></a>
        directive, Apache will redirect you to a new hostname when
        constructing self-referential URLs. This happens, for
        example, in the case where you request a directory without
        including the trailing slash.</p>

        <p>When this happens, Apache will ask for authentication
        once under the original hostname, perform the redirect, and
        then ask again under the new hostname. For security
        reasons, the browser must prompt again for the password

        <p>The goal here is to prevent people from inlining your images

        appear inline in your pages.<p>

        <p>This can be accomplished with a combination of SetEnvIf and
        the Deny and Allow directives. However, it is important to 
        understand that any access restriction based on the REFERER
        header is intrinsically problematic due to the fact that 
        browsers can send an incorrect REFERER, either because they 
        want to circumvent your restriction or simply because they don't
        send the right thing (or anything at all).</p>

        <p>The following configuration will produce the desired effect
        if the browser passes correct REFERER headers.</p>

<pre>
SetEnvIf REFERER "www\.mydomain\.com" linked_from_here
SetEnvIf REFERER "^$" linked_from_here

&lt;Directory /www/images&gt;

        <a id="rewrite-complexity"
        name="rewrite-complexity"><strong>Why is mod_rewrite so
        difficult to learn and seems so complicated?</strong></a> 

        <p>Hmmm... there are a lot of reasons. First, mod_rewrite
        itself is a powerful module which can help you in really
        <strong>all</strong> aspects of URL rewriting, so it can be
        no trivial module per definition. To accomplish its hard
        job it uses software leverage and makes use of a powerful
        regular expression library by Henry Spencer which is an
        integral part of Apache since its version 1.2. And regular
        expressions itself can be difficult to newbies, while
        providing the most flexible power to the advanced
        hacker.</p>

        <p>On the other hand mod_rewrite has to work inside the
        Apache API environment and needs to do some tricks to fit
        there. For instance the Apache API as of 1.x really was not
        designed for URL rewriting at the <tt>.htaccess</tt> level
        of processing. Or the problem of multiple rewrites in
        sequence, which is also not handled by the API per design.
        To provide this features mod_rewrite has to do some special
        (but API compliant!) handling which leads to difficult
        processing inside the Apache kernel. While the user usually
        doesn't see anything of this processing, it can be
        difficult to find problems when some of your RewriteRules
        seem not to work.</p>

        <p>Use "<samp>RewriteLog somefile</samp>" and

        the steps the rewriting engine performs. This is really the

        <p>If the rule starts with <samp>/somedir/...</samp> make
        sure that really no <samp>/somedir</samp> exists on the
        filesystem if you don't want to lead the URL to match this
        directory, <em>i.e.</em>, there must be no root directory
        named <samp>somedir</samp> on the filesystem. Because if
        there is such a directory, the URL will not get prefixed
        with DocumentRoot. This behavior looks ugly, but is really
        important for some other aspects of URL rewriting.</p>

        <a id="rewrite-nocase" name="rewrite-nocase"><strong>How
        can I make all my URLs case-insensitive with
        mod_rewrite?</strong></a> 

        <p>You can't! The reasons are: first, that, case
        translations for arbitrary length URLs cannot be done
        <em>via</em> regex patterns and corresponding
        substitutions. One needs a per-character pattern like the
        sed/Perl <samp>tr|..|..|</samp> feature. Second, just
        making URLs always upper or lower case does not solve the
        whole problem of case-INSENSITIVE URLs, because URLs
        actually have to be rewritten to the correct case-variant
        for the file residing on the filesystem in order to allow
        Apache to access the file. And the Unix filesystem is
        always case-SENSITIVE.</p>

        <p>But there is a module named <code><a
        href="../mod/mod_speling.html">mod_speling.c</a></code> in
        the Apache distribution. Try this module to help correct
        people who use mis-cased URLs.</p>

        <a id="putsupport" name="putsupport"><strong>Why can't I
        publish to my Apache server using PUT on Netscape Gold and
        other programs?</strong></a> 

        <p>Because you need to install and configure a script to
        handle the uploaded files. This script is often called a
        "PUT" handler. There are several available, but they may
        have security problems. Using FTP uploads may be easier and
        more secure, at least for now. For more information, see
        the <cite>Apache Week</cite> article <a

        Pages with PUT</cite></a>.</p>

        <a id="SSL-i" name="SSL-i"><strong>Why doesn't Apache
        include SSL?</strong></a> 

        <p>SSL (Secure Socket Layer) data transport requires
        encryption, and many governments have restrictions upon the
        import, export, and use of encryption technology. If Apache
        included SSL in the base package, its distribution would
        involve all sorts of legal and bureaucratic issues, and it
        would no longer be freely available. Also, some of the
        technology required to talk to current clients using SSL is
        patented by <a href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA Data
        Security</a>, who restricts its use without a license.</p>

        <p>Some SSL implementations of Apache are available,
        however; see the "<a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/related_projects.html">related
        projects</a>" page at the main Apache web site.</p>

        <a id="footer" name="footer"><strong>How can I attach a
        footer to my documents without using SSI?</strong></a> 

        <p>You can make arbitrary changes to static documents by
        configuring an <a
        href="../mod/mod_actions.html#action">Action</a> which
        launches a CGI script. The CGI is then responsible for
        setting a content-type and delivering the requested
        document (the location of which is passed in the
        <samp>PATH_TRANSLATED</samp> environment variable), along
        with whatever footer is needed.</p>

        <p>Busy sites may not want to run a CGI script on every
        request, and should consider using an Apache module to add
        the footer. There are several third party modules available
        through the <a href="http://modules.apache.org/">Apache
        Module Registry</a> which will add footers to documents.
        These include mod_trailer, PHP
        (<samp>php3_auto_append_file</samp>), mod_layout, and
        mod_perl (<samp>Apache::Sandwich</samp>).</p>

        <a id="search" name="search"><strong>Does Apache include a
        search engine?</strong></a> 

        <p>Apache does not include a search engine, but there are
        many good commercial and free search engines which can be
        used easily with Apache. Some of them are listed on the <a
        href="http://www.searchtools.com/tools/tools.html">Web Site
        Search Tools</a> page. Open source search engines that are
        often used with Apache include <a

      <li>
        <a id="rotate" name="rotate"><strong>How can I rotate my
        log files?</strong></a> 

        <p>The simple answer: by piping the transfer log into an
        appropriate log file rotation utility.</p>

        <p>The longer answer: In the src/support/ directory, you
        will find a utility called <a
        href="../programs/rotatelogs.html">rotatelogs</a> which can
        be used like this:</p>
<pre>
   TransferLog "|/path/to/rotatelogs /path/to/logs/access_log 86400"
</pre>

        <p>to enable daily rotation of the log files.<br />
         A more sophisticated solution of a logfile rotation
        utility is available under the name <code>cronolog</code>
        from Andrew Ford's site at <a
        href="http://www.cronolog.org/">http://www.cronolog.org/</a>.
        It can automatically create logfile subdirectories based on
        time and date, and can have a constant symlink point to the
        rotating logfiles. (As of version 1.6.1, cronolog is
        available under the <a href="../LICENSE">Apache
        License</a>). Use it like this:</p>
<pre>
   CustomLog "|/path/to/cronolog --symlink=/usr/local/apache/logs/access_log /usr/local/apache/logs/%Y/%m/access_log" combined
</pre>

        <a id="conditional-logging"
        name="conditional-logging"><strong>How do I keep certain
        requests from appearing in my logs?</strong></a> 

        <p>The maximum flexibility for removing unwanted
        information from log files is obtained by post-processing
        the logs, or using piped-logs to feed the logs through a
        program which does whatever you want. However, Apache does
        offer the ability to prevent requests from ever appearing
        in the log files. You can do this by using the <a
        href="../mod/mod_setenvif.html#SetEnvIf"><code>SetEnvIf</code></a>
        directive to set an environment variable for certain
        requests and then using the conditional <a
        href="../mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog-conditional"><code>
        CustomLog</code></a> syntax to prevent logging when the
        environment variable is set.</p>

        <p>No. Apache is a Web (HTTP) server, not an application
        server. The base package does not include any such
        functionality. See the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP
        project</a> and the <a

        examples of modules that allow you to work with databases
