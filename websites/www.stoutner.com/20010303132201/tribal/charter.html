I. Tribal Motus is a family that strives to work well together. As such, before being accepted into TM, you must attend at least 3 "raids" with the guild and do your best to introduce yourself to everyone in the guild. Raids do not necessarily need to be "planar" in status, but mini raids in different places where there are multiple TM members are acceptable. The purpose of this rule is to let people get to know the new members. This ensures that everyone will get along and can function as a team. Getting a chance to join the current guild members also gives the applicant an opportunity to get to know other people in the guild and see if they truly wish to become a part of the family. A family consists of members who go out of their way to help each other, and Tribal Motus members are proud to say that they do just that.

II. It is strongly encouraged for all members to attend all official TM raids. Even if you cannot stay for the duration of the raid, your assistance would be greatly appreciated. We understand if the activity is outside of your level range or you have RL commitments, but if your main character is high enough to attend said raid, he/she should try to be there participating unless you have a prior commitment. If you have a prior commitment, let it known that you will not be able to attend. Members should make all attempts possible to attend raids. Not attending any raids for an extended period of time without any communication with the guild may raise issues on your devotion to the Tribal Motus family. We understand that not everyone can participate all the time, but the only way to get that raid going that you ‘need’ is to help out others when they are also in need. It has been said that to better your guildmate is to better yourself, and I think that is true. Let’s live up to that saying.

III. Failure to attend a raid to which you were committed may result in a warning. After 3 warnings, the officers will review your guild status for discussion or possible termination.

IV. As a Tribal Motus member you are expected to be on your best behavior at all times. Player reputation is very important in EQ and we take it very seriously. Kill Stealing, verbal abuse, harassing of another player, flagrant cussing and general antagonistic behavior will not be tolerated. We are here to have fun, but a certain amount of restraint and maturity is expected from all of us.

V. If you have a problem with another player in the guild it is up to you to solve it as quickly and quietly as you can. Do not insist on making it a guild matter by spamming guildsay with your argument. You and the person whom with you are arguing may be removed from the guild until the dispute is settled. Contact an officer if you feel that you have been wronged in anyway, or if you need to discuss the actions of another member. Remember to respect your fellow guild members by thinking about what you are saying before something that could be construed as hurtful or demeaning is spoken.

VI. Conflicts with other players outside the guild should also be resolved in a like manner. At no point should there be "ooc" or "shout" arguments between a TM member and another player. No one likes zone spam of this type and we should be above it.

VII. Any and all raid ideas should be given to the official raid planner before announcement of the raid is made. This should be at least 48 hours before the raid is to commence so that sufficient time to plan and get player support is given. All members are encouraged to submit their requests for raids and suggestions so that we can all achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. This guild isn't about one person, it's about a family - and we'll act as such.

VIII. All raids will be posted on the "Raid Board" on the Tribal Motus web site. If you CANNOT attend a certain raid you are expected to either 1) let an officer know well beforehand or 2) post on the raid board under the raid in question that you cannot be there. As stated before everyone else is expected to be there.

IX. Officers are first and foremost Tribal Motus members. Being an officer does not entitle you to anything more than a normal member can get. Officers are there to guide the rest of the guild with recruiting, raids, etc. The only way a new officer can be added is to be voted in unanimously by the other Officers. Contacting an Officer and letting him/her know that you are interested in becoming an Officer of Tribal Motus is acceptable, but begging to become an Officer is not. One person, no matter who they are, cannot make someone an Officer. The best way to become an officer, if you so desire, is to follow the guild rules, help as much as you can, and make Tribal Motus the best guild on the server.

X. As Tribal Motus is a guild that has full planar aspirations and beyond, recruiting new members will be needed. The goal of obtaining new members is to get quality individuals who will adhere to the high standards and integrity we value as being in Tribal Motus. These individuals are preferably level 47+. We will make exceptions for lower level people who are friends and can benefit the guild by adding 'camaraderie'. The lower level members will need to be made aware of the fact that they will be missing out on one of the core aspects of the guild, which is raids. They will still have to do three guild ‘raids’, but as TM has a bunch of ‘twink’ characters, we should be able to accommodate them.

XI. All members must frequent the message board for updates on raids and add input when they have the opportunity to other member’s general questions. This ensures that everyone is well informed about EverQuest and about Tribal Motus.
