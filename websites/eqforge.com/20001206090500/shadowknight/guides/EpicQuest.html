Now I ask you, worthy shadowknight, do you not feel the fires of hatred coursing through your veins like never before? That is the very reward I spoke of! You have been brought closer to my master. My mission is complete! You foolish excuse for a dark knight, I shall take your head and tell all of your generous donation to the mighty Teir'Dal rogues!</b><br>

You find a "letter to Duriek" on his corpse that reads:<br>
<br>
<b>Duriek, I have searched this godless pit for what seems to be an eternity with nothing to show for my efforts. I pray to Innoruuk that you have made some breakthrough in your research. Please update me as to your progress. In the meanwhile I have run into some unexpected expenses and will need some funds to carry on. An additional ten thousand should suffice.<br>

Duriek Bloodpool can be found in Paineel.  Hand him the letter you have... found.</p><br>
<br>
<b>Duriek Bloodpool says 'Yes, most unfortunate. I was informed last week of the death of my most recent apprentice. A few months ago, I paid a substantial sum to a group of rogues sent from Neriak to collect on a gambling debt. He swore to me that was the end of it, but I suspected otherwise. My warnings of gambling with the rogues fell on deaf ears. Please accept this for your troubles.</b><br>

I must now get to the task of replacing my associate.</b><br>
<i>You say, 'I will replace him'</i><br>
<b>Duriek Bloodpool says 'Hmm, you seem a bit green and I hesitate to trust you with such an important work, but time is of the essence as my days in this world are running out.

<b>Duriek Bloodpool says 'Thank you. Now, quickly, there is not much time for me. What I tell you here now must never be shared with another soul. I have spent the better part of my life piecing together clues for the creation of a legendary dark blade, a corrupted Ghoulbane. I am very close to understanding the method used in manipulating the enchantments of the Ghoulbane, but in my current condition, I cannot finish collecting the research. My previous apprentice was searching for this last clue when he met his untimely demise.</b><br>

Recover that tome for me and I am certain I will be able to corrupt the Ghoulbane.   My name will be etched in history and you will wield a legend! You must hurry now, and I must return to my studies. Do not return to me, <i>{your name}</i> , without the tome.</b><br>

<b>Duriek Bloodpool   gasps at you in astonishment, eyes beaming with pride and says, 'You've found it!  It seems I underestimated you.  You have succeeded where others failed.  I feared it would never come to pass.'  Duriek takes the key from his neck, softly muttering some words, and places it in a previously unseen keyhole. The book's hinges creak as Duriek pulls it open.  After reading for a few moments, he says,  'It is even better than I had hoped!  It will take me weeks to uncover a portion of what this book has to offer. But this is what I have been searching for, so many years!  At last I know the items required to corrupt that accursed blade!'</b><br>

Alas, I am far too ill to travel and collect these pieces. I must call upon your youth and ability again, <i>{your name}</i> .

<b>Teydar says 'The object you desire is very difficult to fashion, nearly impossible, really. All I can offer to do is try. The real difficulty is the contents that give the sheath its power.

<b>Duriek Bloodpool takes the Ghoulbane and places the other swords on either side of it. The sheath begins to gleam so intensely, you can see the bones inside Duriek's hands. After several minutes, there is a final, blinding flash. Duriek collapses to the ground. After a few moments, Duriek motions you closer and whispers, 'You have done well. I wish fate had been kinder to me and allowed me your aid years ago, I might have lived long enough to enjoy the fame our combined efforts. I studied much of the tome you retrieved and have stumbled upon something that may be the key to unleashing darkness upon the face of Norrath forever.

<i>You say, 'What is the cure?'</i><br>
