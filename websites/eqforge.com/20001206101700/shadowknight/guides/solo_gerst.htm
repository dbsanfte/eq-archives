            <p> I can honestly tell you i dont recommend going solo, but if you 
              dont have a group or you chose to mess around alone, i have some 
              tatics presented below. First of all, make a pet. Sure pets are 
              pretty much worthless in groups, but every little bit helps when 
              soloing. Additionally, pets give you a good five to ten second head 
              start if you have to run. For the most part, you tank. Not the pet. 
              Pet is there to give you that extra 12dmg or so a round. Though 
              sometimes i like to send out the pet to engage the enemy and then 
              cast whatever DoTs i can at will. If you give your pet a weapon, 
              give it a piercing weapon or nothing at all. Pets fight better with 
              fast weapons. One tactic if have used is to cast fear on the mob 
              and have the pet attack the mob as it is running. You can get a 
              few DoTs in as well before the mob comes back. I have gotten the 
              mob halfway dead or more before i actually engaged in melee. Use 
              this tactic in open fields ( like the Karanas, aviaks are primo 
              targets), not in dungeons or mob my bring back friends.<br>
              <br>
              Spells for SKs are very helpful as you reach higher lvls. For soloing, 
              the darkness line of spells is a must. Its a DoT and more importantly, 
              slows the mob down. This is the spell you cast on a mob to engage. 
              Darkness will slow the mob down enough so you have time to cast 
              other DoTs or do various tatics. Mob will also not run away or attack 
              you when it reaches the &quot;run&quot; part of its health ( point 
              in mob's health when it trys to run.) Also very helpful spell in 
              kiting or fear tactic mention above. Disease cloud is a good spell 
              if you are low lvl. It prevents the mob from healing ( 2 tick per 
              sec dmg negates 2 tick per sec heal of mob). Another important spell 
              is siphon strength. To me this spell gives me a pernament 9 str 
              bonus. Very quick casting time and low mana to cast. Always cast 
              this spell as much as you can. Once you reach lvl 22, you can get 
              vampiric embrace. This adds a lifetap effect (drains hpts as you 
              hit) to your weapon and it helps that every little bit. Other offensive 
              spells in your arsenal are heat blood and heart flutter. Heat blood 
              is the strongest DoT SKs get and heart flutter lowers AC and Str 
              in addition to DoT. Dont forget the various undead DD spells. Helpful 
              in unrest, befallen, lguk and such. Besides the obvious offensive 
              spells of the SKs, there are surprising number of complementary 
              or defensive spells. Shieldskin gives you an extra two or three 
              no hit protection. This spell is even better used when you are in 
              a group (Will explain in my SK group tactics guide) Locate dead 
              is essential if you are soloing, cuz you are gonna die alot solo 
              and you probably will lose the location of your body. Shadowstep 
              is an all around good spell in all situations. Gives you time to 
              cast DoTs and such. Use this spell in open fields though. Feign 
              death is a very good spell for SKs. Whether soloing or grouping, 
              feign death is awesome. Soloing, you want to use this spell if you 
              are getting low in hpts and you know you wont make the run to the 
              zone. The mob will think you dead and leave you alone. Saved my 
              life many times. Other useful spells in certain situations are endure 
              cold and disease spells and cancel magic, shadow vortex, and lull 
              undead.</p>
            <p> Soloing pretty much limits you to certain zones to solo effectively. 
              Big, open flat zones are your grounds when soloing. These are the 
              karanas, ros, oasis, commons, etc. You probably want to sit yourself 
              near zone line or a relatively safe place where mobs dont roam. 
              If soloing in dungeon, most always park your butt at zone line. 
              Best tatic is to distance yourself from mob spawns, cast your pet, 
              tell your pet to guard that area ( use /pet guard here) and cast 
              whatever buffs you have on you. Then look around the zone for mobs. 
              Once mob is in sight, cast a spell to engage. Usually i cast darkness, 
              so it slows considerably so i can cast other DoTs or give me prep 
              time. When mob gives chase, run back to pet and either cast DoTs, 
              wait for melee, or have pet engage ( using /pet attack) . Eventually 
              though you will have to engage in melee and you will have to tank 
              yourself. Hopefully all the DoTs and buffs you casted already will 
              have the mob already half dead. Use your pet health to your advantage 
              too. If you are getting whacked alot, back off and let the mob hit 
              the pet for a bit. Then jump back in. Mob will almost always engage 
              in you again since pet is relatively weak. If you are really getting 
              whacked, run away and let the pet tank. Then while still in range 
              of spells, gauge whether to cast DoTs again (since DoTs last like 
              a min or so) or to run your butt to zone. If you kill the mob, congratulate 
              yourself and sit down to med or heal. Its important to use tactics 
              even while medding or healing. Keep your pet in the direction where 
              most trouble looms. So if a big sand giant comes towards you from 
              the front and you have the pet in front of you, the sg will attack 
              the pet first.<br>
              <br>
              Harm touch is your best backup plan when soloing. Nothing else turns 
              the tides of battle quicker than a well timed harm touch. Very deadly 
              due the instant casting time and big dmg. Harm touch is most effective 
              in the lower lvls as most mobs around those lvls are hurt considerably 
              by a harm touch. Again though, you have to use harm touches wisely. 
              Cycle time is about 1hr and a half. Never use harm touch at beginning 
              of battle unless you know you could never kill the mob without it 
              or you just want it dead fast. Though best to use it later in battle 
              in almost all situations. Try to gauge the point when the health 
              of the mob, when ht is cast, will cause the mob to run. This can 
              save you precious mana and health. It is important to use HT at 
              a certain time in the battle. The mob should be weakened considerably 
              so its resist is lowered. Also, HT is more effective if you use 
              it behind the mob. This will help you get max dmg. It is important 
              to /con the mob too White mobs resist half dmg alot and yellow and 
              up commonly resist most dmg if not all. Of course, harm touch is 
              most important if the battle is real close and you are almost dead. 
              HT will surely turn you in favor of the battle. </p>
            <p> I hope you future shadow knights in training heed this guide and 
              learn wisely from it. I will update accordingly when given time. 
              May Innoruuk be with you!</p>
