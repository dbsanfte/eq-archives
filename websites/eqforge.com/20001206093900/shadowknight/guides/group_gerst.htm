            <p> Shadow Knights, like any class, are very valuable to a group if 
              used effectively. This guide will help you earn your keep. Probably 
              the most important thing to remember is that you are a tank, a meleer. 
              Your job is to take dmg, protect the casters, and dish out some 
              dmg too. </p>
            <p> First, a SK must be good at taking dmg. This is more important 
              than dishing it out at most times. In a group, you want the group 
              to work towards its max potential. That cant be done if the wizzy 
              or cleric in your group is getting nailed. Thus, you have to watch 
              the health bars of your group members as much as you watch the fight. 
              Taunting the mob is the tactic used to gain the attention of the 
              mob. For a SK, taunting can be done by using taunt skill, spells, 
              or harm touch. You want to taunt enough so the mob will gain your 
              attention, but not too much so that it sticks to you. Spells are 
              a better choice for a taunt than taunt skill since it will dmg the 
              mob also. The taunt on the spell isnt too much either that the mob 
              will stick to you. You have to communicate to your group members 
              your actions so they all can act accordingly and so you can see 
              the feedback. If you use taunt, say so. If you use a certain spell, 
              like engulfing darkness, say so. Your group members, in turn, can 
              do certain things at certain times, so each in turn taunts the mob 
              effectively so dmg is spread out. Other tactics besides taunting 
              is using the fear spell to make a mob run away or shadow step to 
              get the mob off you.<br>
              <br>
              Another job a SK has is scouting. SKs are very good as scouts due 
              to the invis, invis to undead, and feign death spells a SK has. 
              Cast invis on yourself and go scout the area. If you are caught 
              and you got too many mobs, feign, and the mobs will leave you alone. 
              Good hpts and ac are a plus too if attacked. </p>
            <p> Shadow Knights are probably the second best pullers, behind monks, 
              due to feign death spell and other spells used in conjunction. The 
              feign death spell is has a slower recycle time than the monks and 
              can be interrupted, but works just the same. On normal pulls, SKs 
              can use engulfing darkness to engage the mob from a distance and 
              slow the mob down. This will give you time to run back to your group 
              before getting hit. Optionally, you can use a bow and arrow too. 
              You can feign death if you get too many for your group to handle. 
              If you want to break a room or pull one mob from a group of mobs, 
              feign death can be used. SKs have an advantage in being able to 
              spell the mob from a distance so SK can feign before getting whacked. 
              Also, spells can be used to grab the last mob walking back to its 
              spot. Monks have to normally run up to the mob to engage and to 
              pull the last mob walking back. Other SKs spells help in pulling. 
              Invisibility and invisibility to undead are useful to pull when 
              you have to get into aggro range of mob and you dont want to be 
              caught unawares. Shieldskin is also helpful. It protects you from 
              2 to 3 hits from the mob when pulling and prevents you from becoming 
              stunned if hit. Lull undead can be cast on undead mobs to single 
              out a mob. </p>
            <p> Shadow Knights have some others useful talents. SKs can locate 
              corpses if one of the group members lost his body. SKs also have 
              some buffs spells, like endure and resist disease and cold. Other 
              spells include water breathing, cancel magic, and shadow vortex. 
              Sometimes the evil nature of the SK can help a group, since SKs 
              can kill almost anything without it affecting most of the SKs factions 
              in a bad way. The SK can kill a certain good NPC for example that 
              holds a certain items that would give bad factions for someone else, 
              but not the SK.</p>
            <p> Hopefully this guide has help you in being a more affective SK 
              in a group. Vendui.</p>
