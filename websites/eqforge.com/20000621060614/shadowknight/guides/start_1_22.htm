          <td style="border-bottom: 1px double">As a Shadow Knight, you are part 
            Warrior and part Necromancer. Most people say 1/4th Necro and 3/4th 
            Warrior, but this varies between the races. Obviously, Humans and 
            Dark Elves with their lower strength will try to make up for it with 
            their greater mana. Without getting into a debate about the best race 
            for a Shadow Knight, I will present each level of spells through 22 
            from my 26th level Dark Elf Xilith&#146;s point of view. 
            <p> </p>
            <p><font size="3" color="#669933"><b>Rank 1 &#150; Level 9 (mostly 
              level 1 Necro spells)</b></font></p>
            <p>Finally, you have spells! One nice thing about hybrids is the spells 
              are always cheap relative to a caster. You must remember to train 
              in your magic skills. There are 5 different schools of magic: Abjuration, 
              Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, and Evocation. In addition, 
              you should train in Channeling, which will allow you to cast faster, 
              and resist interruption. This is extremely important to an SK since 
              they almost always cast in combat and get hit in the middle. At 
              level 26 I am able to recover quite often and get that spell off. 
              At this rank, you only get Alteration, Conjuration, and Divination 
              spells, so you might consider waiting to train Abjuration and Evocation 
              (First Evocation spell is at 22nd level &#150; Ward Undead). After 
              you have trained in the magical arts, you must purchase your spells 
              and scribe them. Since you don&#146;t yet have Meditate, this can 
              be a tedious process, but it will get better at 12th level. At this 
              level, you won&#146;t find magic to be of that much assistance, 
              but you will get used to having 10 higher strength constantly.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Disease Cloud:</font></b> Diseases the 
              target and hits for 5 damage. The best use I have found for this 
              spell is that at lower levels it can be quite a taunt. I found monsters 
              would stay on me more and off my wizard if I threw a disease in 
              between swings every now and then. I still have it memorized, and 
              use it on really long fights and while kiting to prevent mobs from 
              healing. </p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Invisibility to Undead:</font></b> At 
              this level, only useful to avoid wandering undead, can make the 
              run up from South Ro much easier. In a few levels, it is really 
              good in Befallen, and again later when pulling from the house in 
              Unrest. I don&#146;t regularly keep it memorized unless I&#146;m 
              in Unrest. Remember, you can cast this one on others too. Mana cost 
              is really high for this level.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Leering Corpse:</font></b> Your first 
              pet, it should be level 4+. Pets are the subject of much debate 
              for SK&#146;s. I&#146;m doing an article on using pets soon as well. 
              I don&#146;t remember using my pet much at this level. Troll and 
              Ogre SK&#146;s may not be able to summon a pet when they first get 
              this spell due to the high mana cost.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Locate Corpse: </font></b>This will target 
              the nearest corpse, and turn you towards it. If you target a player, 
              it will turn you towards their corpse and target it. Obvious use 
              is to find your corpse, or if it&#146;s not lost, to plot a straight 
              line to it. Another use is when a monster dies inside a tree or 
              wall. Clear your target and cast this spell, and it will target 
              the corpse. Then use the /loot command to loot it.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Sense the Dead:</font></b> Targets the 
              nearest undead, and turns you toward it. This can be a problem in 
              zones with a lot of SK&#146;s and Necro&#146;s, such as Nektrulos, 
              as it will target pets as well. Useful at this level to find things 
              to fight. Might allow to find pet if pet is targeted</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Siphon Strength:</font></b> Steals 10 
              strength from target and gives it to you. I have had this spell 
              memmed ever since I bought it, and rely on it to remain unencumbered 
              (weak DE remember?), and to get a little extra damage. Low mana 
              cost, so you can cast it on everything you fight as a cheap debuff, 
              or to pull. In my eyes, one of our best spells.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><font color="#669933"><b><font size="3">Rank 2 &#150; Level 15 
              (mostly level 4 Necro spells)</font></b></font></p>
            <p>At this level, you will see your spells start to make a larger 
              difference in the way you play, and you will find yourself much 
              more effective at each new rank. If you haven&#146;t already, train 
              in Abjuration for Numb the Dead and Endure Cold.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Bone Walk:</font></b> A new pet, about 
              level 8. Much more useful than the last one. Read my guide on pets 
              for some tips at this level.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Clinging Darkness: </font></b>The darkness 
              line is one of our best set of spells. I always had it memorized 
              until I got Engulfing Darkness at level 22. Although not much damage 
              (25-30 points), it will slow the mob down considerably, allowing 
              you to run, or prevent them from running. A great spell to pull 
              with, and/or cast on a monster before it will run. A mob near death 
              will turn its back to you and stand there, waiting for you to finish 
              it off. I love that, and my party too. After the last patch, however, 
              it will not stack with root, so coordinate with your rooters, as 
              this is better in my opinion, and saves them some mana. See Fear 
              below for some interesting combos.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Endure Cold:</font></b> Useful when fighting 
              shamen such as orcs, goblins, and gnolls in High Pass, or in Befallen 
              to help against Ice Boned Skeletons. Also useful later on when fighting 
              higher wizzes that use cold based attacks. You can keep your group 
              buffed with this to save a shaman or other buffer some mana.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Fear:</font></b> This spell has a few 
              uses, and can get you into trouble as well. You can cast it on a 
              mob in a camp to pull the others, and not have to fight him until 
              he returns. You can also slow a mob with a darkness spell, and then 
              fear it while you and your pet or party beat on it. I used this 
              to solo blues in South Karanas a little after 22nd level with Engulfing 
              Darkness. You have to watch out, though, because feared monsters 
              can and will bring back friends when it wears off. Also great in 
              PvP or duels, either using the above tactic or, in dangerous zones, 
              to get them killed by falling or lava. Another use is to fear something 
              to let you run away from it. Due to the long casting time, difficult 
              to get off while getting hit. I usually pull with darkness, then 
              send my pet to intercept, and cast fear while he takes a few hits.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Mend Bones: </font></b>You can heal your 
              pet, or some other Necro/SK&#146;s pet with this. Doesn&#146;t heal 
              very much, though, but I generally have enough mana to burn as a 
              DE. I used this in Oasis at levels 15-17 to let my pet tank while 
              I stepped in to take swings with a high damage, high delay weapon 
              (Shiny Brass Halberd I believe) Read my pet guide for more info 
              on this.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Numb the Dead: </font></b>Used like lull, 
              but undead. Useful for pulling part of an undead camp. I only used 
              this while camping skeletons in Rathe Mts, but might be useful to 
              get you out of Befallen or Unrest as well.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Shadow Step:</font></b> This spell casts 
              really, really fast, maybe in a sec. Useful in a duel or PvP to 
              confuse your advisary or to get a headstart on a mob/player while 
              fleeing. It can disorient you, too, so watch out.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><font color="#000033"><b><font size="3" color="#669933">Rank 3 
              &#150; Level 22 (mostly level 8 Necro Spells)</font></b></font></p>
            <p>This is a good time for SK&#146;s. You&#146;ve just had your damage 
              cap removed, an improved regeneration rate, and now have double 
              attack. By now you have a good weapon, and your pet can no longer 
              hold a monsters attention if you are in melee with it.. The best 
              spell at this level is Engulfing Darkness, and improvement to Clinging 
              Darkness that will dish out about 100 points of damage in addition 
              to the slowing effect you&#146;ve come to love. You will need to 
              train Evocation if you haven&#146;t yet, and will find it hard to 
              improve since you have just got your first Evoc spell, Ward Undead.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Convoke Shadow:</font></b> About level 
              12 pet. It can now dish out more damage, but is only good for a 
              few hits, so don&#146;t let it tank except to get off a spell. Still, 
              pets can be a good DOT. Useful for the darkness/fear combo described 
              above.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Dark Empathy:</font></b> Trades about 
              20 hp from yourself to the target. For Trolls this can be really 
              useful to even out the hit points of the tanks. At this level, you 
              won&#146;t save many lives with it, so mainly useful after combat. 
              One trick, if you are already hurt to or below half and can bandage 
              well, is to cast on other wounded player(s) that are above half 
              and then bandage yourself. Useful if you can&#146;t rest long, and 
              the other player can tank the next fight since you will be left 
              at half.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Deadeye: </font></b>See invisible. Great 
              on PvP servers to avoid a surprise, or to save a mage casting see 
              invis on you before following him invisibly.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Engulfing Darkness: </font></b>Did I mention 
              I love this line of spells? Better damage, but used the same. Good 
              for about 100 points. You can just about kite with this on blues.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Spook the Dead:</font></b> Makes undead 
              run away. I have never used this spell, but your mileage may vary.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Vampiric Embrace: </font></b>Another point 
              of argument. Most likely due to the fact that often SK&#146;s use 
              slow 2H slashing weapons that don&#146;t give much of a chance to 
              do the embrace. Also, has a short duration (about the length of 
              an average fight). At level 22 it will steal 13 health, and it goes 
              up one point for every two levels. A high DEX will help it to go 
              off more in combat. I&#146;ve had it go off 4 times in a fight, 
              and I&#146;ve had it go off none, but it&#146;s better than nothing, 
              so I try to cast before a pull or respawn. I&#146;d be interested 
              in hearing from someone using a really low delay weapon to see how 
              often they get it to work. Contrary to what Necro&#146;s may tell 
              you, this spell HAS been changed to work with or without a weapon.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Ward Undead:</font><font color="#99CC66"> 
              </font></b>Does about 41 damage to undead. Not very much you say? 
              But if you use a high delay weapon like I do, you can cast in between 
              swings and it starts stacking up. You can also fall back and attack 
              from afar with this if you get seriously hurt. Here&#146;s a trick 
              to get your Evocation up to par&#133; Summon a pet, target it, and 
              cast this repeatedly. You will fizzle a lot at first, but you will 
              improve, even though your pet is unaffected. I did this while camping 
              a slow spawn and got it up 60 points in one night.</p>
