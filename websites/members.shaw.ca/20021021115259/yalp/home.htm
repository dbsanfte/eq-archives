	  <h5>What is YALP?</h5> 
      <p>YALP is yet another log parser for Sony's very successfull game EverQuest. If you
      don't know what a log parser is, you can think of if as a sort of file viewer. Much
      like how your browser displays this web page, YALP will display the information from
      one of the log files that EverQuest generates as you play. There are many log parsers
      available on the web, and each of them is a little different.
      </p>
      <h5>What does a log parser do?</h5>
      <p>Log parsers summarize the information found in your log files, and present it in
      a more readable way. People want different things from log parsers, some people are
      more interested in finding conversation histories, others are more interested in
      seeing skill and faction changes, still others are more interested in damage
      information. Good log parsers provide a number of these features, but no log parser
      can provide every desired feature for every user.
      </p>
      <h5>Whats special about YALP?</h5> 

      <p>YALP is a robust little log parser that is extremely fast and provides the
	  most thorough damage information of any log parser. In less than half the time
	  that other log parsers produce statistics for your character, YALP will produce
	  damage statistics for every single party in a log file. YALP's unique party centric 
	  design enables it to provide a complete view of damage from the perspective of any
	  party.
	  </p>
	  <p>With YALP, you can find the answer to questions like; "What was the damage
	  per second that my friend Jonaz did to the Hill Giants that we fought together?", or
	  "Who did the most damage to the Cyclops we ran into?". Other log parsers can't
	  answer these questions because they simply don't have a full accounting of damage
	  to and from every party.
      </p>
	  <p>YALP is really designed to be an offline parser for sort of a weekly or monthly
	  review of how your character is comming along. Even though you can use YALP to parse
	  a log file as large as 200 megs, I really suggest archiving your log file once a month
	  or so, and starting fresh. This way the statistics that you see are kept fairly current.
	  </p>
	  <p>So, YALP is fast, it provides great damage stats for everybody, it lets you view your 
	  log in color, it allows you to search your log for any text, and best of all, its free.
	  If you like YALP, please take the time to spread the word, and maybe even
	  <a href="http://www.gamesites200.com/everquest/vote.php?id=66">vote</a>
	  for it on the
	  <a href="http://www.gamesites200.com/everquest">EverQuest Top 200</a>
	  site. If you find that YALP does not provide what you really want in a log parser, then
	  check out these other excellent log parsers;
