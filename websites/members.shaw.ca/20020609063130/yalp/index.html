<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>If you play Sony's very successfull game EverQuest, and you
would like to see more information on your characters than the
inventory screen provides, YALP may be just what your looking
for. YALP will summarize the information contained in the log
files that EverQuest generates as you play, showing you very
detailed information on what it finds. There are many EverQuest
log parsers available on the web, but YALP's rare mix of speed,
detail, and features sets it apart from the competition. </p>

<p>Haven't you ever wondered about the amount of damage that
somebody you were grouped with did, or who has the best critical
hits? With YALP, you can answer questions like this because YALP
provides a full account of damage from the perspective of any
party involved in combat, not just from the perspective of your
character. YALP also provides a complete list of all the fights
you had, with detailed information for each fight. </p>

<p>YALP is still in development, and is by no means a totally
mature product. I've got lots of ideas for new things to put into
YALP, and I will post updates every so often to this page. In the
meantime, <a href="#DOWNLOAD">download</a> the latest version of
YALP, and dont hesitate to send email to <a
href="mailto:YALP@shaw.ca">YALP@shaw.ca</a> with any suggestions
or comments you may have. Thank you for using YALP, and happy
EQ'ing!</p>

<h3>News:</h3>

<p>May 25th 2002</p>

<p>Today I started a new EZBoard <a href="http://pub78.ezboard.com/byalpmessageboard">message board</a> for people to ask
questions and have some discussions about YALP. There is only the
one forum as of yet, but I hope to make more very soon.
</p>

<p>May 18th 2002</p>

<p>I did a quick change to take care of a problem introduced by
a recent patch. It involved pricing code, and could cause YALP
to hang. I think this will be a common problem, so I advise
everybody to download YALP again and get this fix.
</p>

<p>May 1st 2002</p>

<p>I managed to track down and squash a big bug that caused some
people to experience a large number of &quot;access
violation&quot; errors when parsing some files. Many thanks to
Mirko Thöle in Germany for helping me fix this one. </p>

<p>Other than the major bug fix, and a few other tweaks, the only
visible change is the addition of a breakdown of your offensive
damage per second by attack type on the fight detail page.
Currently, I'm spending most of my YALP time re-designing the
fight list. There will be a big change to the fight list comming,
as well as some new features - just no promises on how soon. </p>

<h3>Developers Corner:</h3>

<p>I've had a number of people send email asking about how YALP
works, and why its so fast. So, I thought I would make a section
where I could explain a little bit about YALP, and how it works.
If you are interested in programming, check this section for
updates to learn more about YALP.</p>
