	  <h4>September 19, 2002</h4>
	  <p>Version 2.2 released. Big changes for this version include HTML integration for
	  printing and publishing reports, the addition of DPS, AD, and Kills to all damage
	  lists, as well as the beginnings of a new Online mode for YALP. Please help me to
	  make YALP the best EQ log parsing tool around by leaving your comments on the YALP
	  forums.
	  </P>

	  <h4>September 4, 2002</h4>
	  <p>
	  I have had a lot of feedback from people using HITSMODE with short messages, saying
	  that they are having trouble with YALP. Currently for YALP to be able to find hits 
	  in your logs, you MUST use the full message text if you have hitsmode enabled. If
	  you would like to help the situation, please send email to Verrant's
	  <a href="mailto:eqfeedback@soe.sony.com">Feedback Email</a> address, asking them
	  to always place full message text in the log files. People who dont use log files
	  wont be affected, and people who do use log files probably want the maximum information
	  possible.
	  </p>

      <h4>August 22, 2002</h4>
      <p>Test version of YALP made available. This is a test of new DPS and Attack Delay
	  calculations right in the damage objects. Both attack delay and damage per second
	  are produced on each and every damage list. This works at an overall summary level,
	  as well as on a per fight basis. I think that this change will benefit most users,
	  even if it comes at the cost of a little speed.
      </p>

	  <h4>July 14, 2002</h4>
      <p>Update to the website! I was never happy with the look and feel of the old page.
      This is probably the best I can do until I get around to buying and learning a
      decent web authoring tool. Until then, I'm stuck with notepad.exe and its many fine
      features.
      </p>

      <h4>June 24, 2002</h4>
      <p>Version 2.1 released. Big changes for this version inlcude full third party damage
      information in the fight list, the ability to customize screen fonts, and the removal
      of the third party damage toggle. Now YALP will always collect full third party damage
      information from your log files.
