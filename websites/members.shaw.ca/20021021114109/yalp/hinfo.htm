      <p>There are many log parsers for EverQuest available on the world wide web, but YALP's rare
      mix of speed, detail, and features sets it apart from the competition. When it comes to the 
      collection, summary, and display of damage information, YALP is second to none. Unlike
      other log parsers, YALP provides fully detailed damage information for every party found 
      in your log file, and allows you to inspect any damage information, right down to the 
      per-hit level.
      </p>
      <p>What makes YALP different is that it can provide a full accounting of damage from the
      perspective of each party. Because YALP assigns damage lists to every party found in a log
      file, it can properly relate all damage done to and from each and every party. In YALP, the
      damage a party deals to others is called Offensive Damage, and the damage a party takes from 
      others is called Defensive Damage. Each party has its own Offensive and Defensive damage lists.
      When damage is found in a log file, it is attributed to both of the parties involved. The
      attacker gets an entry in his Offensive Damage lists, and the defender gets an entry is his
      Defensive Damage lists. This double entry method is what gives each party a full account of
      all damage they were involved in.
      </p>
      <p>Since each party has their own record of damage, viewing damage information with YALP 
      starts by selecting a party. Once you have selected a party, you can decide which damage to
      view, and how you want it listed. More often than not, you will want to view damage information
      for your character, but you will want to examine damage information for other parties quite
      often. 
      </p>
      <p>With other log parsers it can be impossible to compare your combat performance to the 
      performance of parties that you grouped with. YALP makes it very easy to compare combat
      performance, simply choose the common opponent and display his Defensive Damage by Party 
      list. This list will show a summary of all damage that the opponent received, listed by 
      the name of the party dealing the damage.
      </p>
