And yes some of that had to do with me not being able to play but I also tend to wander and roleplay (roleplay time = no xps) with a few others. Don't let one bad night discourage you. The guild is an access to groups, yes, but not the only one you have. Most of my levels and loot have been made outside of the guild.<br>The ridge in the Dreadlands usually always have people/groups looking for more. Dreacle once said, &quot;The key to leveling is steady blue mobs.&quot; He's right. I have always received better xps by killing a lot of blues rather then trying to kill a few red mobs. Plus it always seems that phat lewtz and xps never go hand in hand.<br>The trick to finding groups is to be where the people are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub52.ezboard.com/ubbmykel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BBMykel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/20/02 3:09:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub52.ezboard.com/ffatdragonshousefrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tuesday Group Agenda</span><hr size=1> Alas it hasn't only been one bad night ;-)<br><br>I've ground out 52 levels largely in pickup groups.

One thing I have found to be very helpful is hunt in the same place repeatedly.<br><br>Ages ago when I first started going to Lower Guk, I had incredibly difficult times getting groups.  I'd spend hours lfg at the zone.  As I stayed there, people who hunt the routinely gradually got to know me, and by the time I was ready to move on (10 levels later) I could zone in, ask for a group, and get several offers right away.<br><br>The same thing is starting to happen to me in Velks.  Tough zone to get a pick-up group, especially the camps that actually drop loot.  I've stayed with it, and am now getting to the point where I am getting asked in right away.<br><br>Find a zone that has what you want, preferably one with both xp and loot goals.  Stay there.  Become known.  You'll get groups, slowly at first, but as your name becomes familiar, you will get em asier and easier.  Many people in this game lock into one zone for months at a time, and group with the people they feel comfy with.  Becoming a regular name they see will make em more comfy with you.  As long as you don't make a bad name for yurself, of course.  :P<br><br>Trust me, it'll work.<br><br>Sinc <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub52.ezboard.com/uzarniwoopgwanslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarniwoop Gwanslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/21/02 11:35:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub52.ezboard.com/ffatdragonshousefrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.magma.ca/~jmccourt/ZGFace.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tuesday Group Agenda</span><hr size=1> I know what you're talking about, Mykel. There are a *lot* of tanks in the low-mid 50s (in the game in general?) and getting into a pickup group can be a tough challenge no matter what zone you are in. It's very frustrating and I've felt mighty discouraged on more than one occasion. Don't take it personally though - it's not just you that encounters this.<br><br>One of my solutions was to play my alt (Trilian), a shaman if I found I couldn't do the LFG thing. I rarely have to advertise more than twice for a group before I get an invite. This, to me, was the path of least resistance to finding a group. If shamans aren't as numerous and yet are still wanted, why shouldn't I play one? <br><br>That's not the perfect solution, of course. Sincro, your suggestion is a very good one. I found the same thing in my mid-40s when I was hunting in Solb a lot - you start to see the same names and eventually you make friends and get invites a lot easier.<br><br>That's just the way EQ goes, I guess.<br><br>ZG<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub52.ezboard.com/umelik001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Melik001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/21/02 3:16:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub52.ezboard.com/ffatdragonshousefrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://server25.hypermart.net/silvermooncreations/images/Melik.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tuesday Group Agenda</span><hr size=1> OK everone.

Use the forums, email (I have a growing list of emails addresses--of course, I can not give them out without permission; but, we have them if people don't mind sharing them with guildies). Also, try sending in game tells to people to coordinate a time that you can all group together. <br><br>One of the important things to use this forum for is getting together. Knowing in advance that you will be on at a certain time on a certain night to play--barring real life issues of course. Post times you can play and places you would like to go. I am constantly encouraging people to read the forums so they can see this information and say &quot;Gee, Melyk and Mighty are available when I am.
