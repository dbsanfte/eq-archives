For Sinc, none really stand out as dumb ways to die, with the exception of accidently hitting the Instill Doubt key one day while fighting the ghoul lord.  For those of you who have instill doubt, they will all tell you the same thing, it *never* works when you want it to, but by god, hit it in a dungeon by accident and it *never* fails.  To make a long story short, the GL went zipping out of the room so fast none of us even realized what had happened.  All we knew was he was gone and so was the mage pet.  So, being the smart people we were, we sit and wait to see what happens next.  All is calm for about 15ish seconds, so we decide something must have killed em both, and we pull onther ghoul frog.  Never mind that all us melee types still had a fuly operational ghoul lord still in our target window.  We get the pull, then I get this little message: Your fear spell has worn off. Hmm, that's interesting.  A little later, what must have been every not killed frog in Lower Guk showed up at our doorstep and wiped us out in about 5 seconds.  Oops...<br><br>For Nitewine, I was lvl 19 and fighting solo in The Overthere.  I was killing a cactus, and was super low on life, but still had plenty of mana.  I start to cast a lifetap, get hit, knocked unconscious, regain concentration and continue casting, land a tap for 11 points, stand back up, take a swing and kill the cactus with about 5 hp to my name.  I stand there in awe and patting myself on the back looking at the incredible chain of events when what I should have been doing was casting feign death.  I sabretooth tiger walked up, smacked me for god knows how much and sent me back to bind point.  I do have a nice screenshot of the first part, before I died, though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Sinc <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub52.ezboard.com/udpin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dpin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/26/02 8:16:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub52.ezboard.com/ffatdragonshousefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=174.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LOADING,PLEASE WAIT.......</span><hr size=1> ok got one for ya this just happened to me a few night ago too.i was in kael no raid or anything we were just gonna camp arena.well we move across the second bridge toward the bank cause we are headin to arena, we get to the arch where there are usually 6 mobs and to my surprise none are up.the grp is still at the bottom of the ramp waiting for the pull or all clear,i tell its clear lets move thru.<br>well as they reach me one of the bridge spawns pops, so im like inc %t, by the time the grp reaches me cause im standing in the archway, 2 more have popped as well behind us and then 2 more in front of us, by now all archway mobs are up and we are in the middle of them,all of them good and pissed too,needless to say it was the quickest grp wipeout ive seen in a long long time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub52.ezboard.com/upurpleotter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Purpleotter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/8/02 3:08:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub52.ezboard.com/ffatdragonshousefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=174.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LOADING,PLEASE WAIT.......</span><hr size=1> I had a shaman on the MM server, I have since deleted her.

When I got to FV Axe told me (on the phone because we always talk while we played) to run NE to the zone wall then start tracking. I had sow and was making good time, found him on track and ran to him. When I got to him Brin was sitting and Axe was on the other side of Brin so thats were I went(passing up Brin).
