<B>6.2 <U>When will Ascension appear on the shelves?</U></B><BR><BR>

The only thing that is known about the release date for U:A is that it definitely will not be out in 1998.  A first quarter of 1999 release is Origin's probable target date.<BR><BR>

<B>6.2.1 <U>Will there be a playable demo of Ultima: Ascension?  If so, when will it be available?</U></B><BR><BR>

The plan is to have a playable demo.  When will it be released, you ask? Well, my friend, I have this on authority from Richard Garriott himself... on the assumption there is one, it will be released no later than the shipping date of Ultima: Ascension.<BR><BR>

<B>6.2.2 <U>How far along is Ascension in the development process?</U></B><BR><BR>

Lord British says: "Post E3, we made the scary decision to rewrite a few core routines within in the project, which is always a scary and dangerous move at this stage in the life cycle of the product. Specifically rewritten was the animation system and the renderer. Conventional wisdom would start shooting off warning flares to undertake such a task... but the good news is that we have high confidence that we're going to see an apprciable difference in frame rate and animation quality. If you had asked me this a few weeks ago - I'd be a lot more concerned, but we're now on the verge of re-intergrating the code and it looks like we'll succeed."<BR><BR>

<B>6.3 <U>Where can I get a look at the game?</U></B><BR><BR>

Screenshots of in-game and cinematic sequences have been released and their scanned versions can be found at:<BR><BR>

In addition, several .avi and .mpg files of in-game gameplay and cinematics have been released and are available for download from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="downloads.html" TARGET="content">Sith Dragon's Ascension Downloads page</A>.<BR><BR>

<B>6.4 <U>Is Ascension "The Lost Vale"?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.  "The  Lost Vale" was supposed to  be an add-on for UVIII. It was  never  released  as the folks  at  Origin didn't think it would sell.<BR><BR>

<B>6.5 <U>Will there be add-ons for Ascension with extra plot elements and characters?</U></B><BR><BR>

There are no current plans.<BR><BR>

<B>6.6 <U>Will there be an Limited Edition Ultima: Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  Origin is thinking of EVENTUALLY planning to get around to brainstorming about what to put in a LE U:A. This, to be perfectly clear, is a long way off yet.  If you have suggestions for what to put in the box, send them to ctaylor@origin.ea.com but please put Limited Edition U:A Suggestion in the subject and limit that email to only suggestions for the U:A LE version.<BR><BR>

<B>6.7 <U>Will there be an Ultima X?</U></B><BR><BR>

Definitely, unless Ascension turns out to be a total bomb :)<BR><BR>

<B>6.8 <U>Cheat Menu</U></B><BR><BR>

What already? And you haven't played the game yet :)<BR><BR>

<B>6.9 <U>Will Ascension be multiplayer?</U></B><BR><BR>

No. That's what Ultima Online is for.
