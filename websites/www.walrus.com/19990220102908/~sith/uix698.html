<U>9 June 1998</U><BR><BR>

After weeks of rest, relaxtion, and finally being left back in the house, Bob White has finally commented on U:A and his departure from Origin:<BR><BR>

<I>As far as what was going on with Ascension, well I can reveal very little since I am under a non-disclosure agreement (the one I signed when I first joined Origin). One thing that does disturb me is that someone at E3 said I had been with Origin for just over a year. I am not sure who said this, but I can probably guess. I was with Origin for 3.5 years, the whiole time working on U:A (UIX originally) except for a six month hiatus on UO. Now that I have cleared that up...<BR><BR>

The reason I left was do to several factors, some of which alot of you have already figured out. When I started at Origin it was the best of the bunch and constantly leading the other companies in ideas and technologies, but I slowly watched the company move from a leader to a follower. They begin to react to the industry rather than acting. Much of this has to do with development based on marketing rather than making games that are truly original ("lets make a game like x"). Another reason had to do with personal difficulties with others. Some decisions that were made impacted the development cycle to the point that I had been working excessive hours for an extremely long time and this had an exceptionally bad impact on my family life (yes I am one of the few game developers with a real family!). I also realized that with the changes being made that one of two events could happen. One, the team would have to go into a major "crunch" mode in effort to get the game produced in time for the shelves at Christmas. Or two, EA would give the team addditional time to produce the game properly and this would push the development cycle
to sometime in Spring of '99. I had already been pushing heavy hours so the first option did not appeal to me and the second option would mean another year of development (giving U:A a five year development cycle!!!). I had no
desire to continue for another year especially since Deus Ex should be finished about that time with less headaches.<BR><BR>

Ascension itself will probably prove to be a great game. I am a picky gamer and very few games please me (System Shock a notable exception!) and I have lost the excitement that used to be there when I started on UIX. However it
will be one of the most visually impactive games ever...it is gorgeous. With time and careful construction the game play may end up being quite good too. A big congradulations to the artist and programmers on the game should be given, for they have done much above and beyond the call of duty in creating the game. We will see what will happen...but I am quite sure you will be waiting a while for it.
</I><BR><BR>

Thanks, Jazar!<BR><BR>

<U>5 June 1998</U><BR><BR>

The official <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.ultima-ascension.com" TARGET="_parent">Ultima: Ascension webpage</A> was updated last night in the first of many planned expansions to the site.  Specificically, a new layout was added to the Information section along with a site news and links page.<BR><BR>

<U>3 June 1998</U><BR><BR>

Now that E3 has wrapped up and folks are beginning to clear away the cobwebs, the first post-E3 U:A reports are starting to come in.<BR><BR>

This bit of U:A smackage (sorry, I couldn't resist) come to us from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds/e3bg.htm" TARGET="_parent">Altered Worlds</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>Ultima 9:<BR><BR>

Plain and simple here....the graphics were 100% amazing. If Unreal took the limits of PC gaming to one height then Ultima 9 will surely be taking it to another. From what I saw the game was still early in development and definitely needs much tweaking. I talked to Ed Castillo for a while about this and he gave me some good food for thought. From what he showed me the graphics were literally earth shaking. He did things with lighting you can only dream about. Night and Day affects were awesome! But one of the best part is the physics model. He showed this cool sign as it swung gently in a breeze but then he hit a button and the breeze picked up and the sign started to flutter with sound affects. Then he hit another button and the sign was swinging like mad in an erratic pattern also...it didn't look fake at all. He said Rain storms will be in with strong winds and trees and leaves etc will blow as well as anything else that will be susceptible to winds. But to me the most shocking thing was seeing the coastline and watch the water and wave affects! But even better than that was seeing a ship for your first time....this thing was rocking with the waves in the most realistic way you'll ever see. Each wave would bring it up and down, and from side to side it swayed. If you stepped in, you began rocking with it almost giving a sense of sea sickness. He said the world is as large as any Ultima, including UO!!! If it's that big, this game could go down in history as the most visually amazing experience in the history of the Industry. With that said, character interaction was something I didn't get to see except him attacking a giant Crab. Combat looked very fun and very realstic. But he said that there will be plenty of character interaction in this game also but it wont be the kind we normally think of. It will be more graphically oriented. Meaning things you see will lead into things that are said...more like real life. Where in the old Ultima's you could read a dialogue tree that went into giant novels. This will be much different. The only problem I saw with the game was how things drew themselves into existence in the distance. I asked about fogging and he said they are still trying to figure out how to cover this up. I sure hope they figure a way out because it is a little distracting. Other than that, this game was probably the most visually amazing game I saw at the show. No matter if your hard Core Ultima fan or what, this game will leave you speechless after seeing it run. Personally I would rather have a more graphical approach rather than the old boring dialogue way.</I><BR><BR>

Thanks, Sacrates!<BR><BR>

<U>1 June 1998</U><BR><BR>

I normally try to paraphrase articles whenever possible, but I think that Mental4's report of U:A really bears repeating in full -- especially considering the amount of acrimony that's surrounding the game.  This report comes to us from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.scorched.com/" TARGET="_parent">Ultima.Scorched.Com</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>First of all, I would like to thank the people at Origin who were kind enough to talk to me at the show. These included Ultima: Ascension producer Ed Del Castillo (who engaged me in a heated one hour debate relating to various gaming elements), Ultima: Ascension designer Seth Mendelsohn, Ultima: Ascension cinematic director and animator Michael Morlan (who gave me a great demo and answered some questions), Ultima Online producer Rich Vogel, the marketing guy who didn't give me a card but gave me my first demo of Ultima: Ascension, and of course Richard Garriott. Everyone I dealt with (save the unnamed marketroid who was somewhat rude while trying in vain to find a scan-ready Ascension logo for me) was friendly, professional and polite.<BR><BR>

To start with, there are a few misconceptions already flying around the web regarding Ascension, and I would like to set these straight.<BR><BR>

<B>The party - is there one or not?</B><BR><BR>

Amazingly, rumors are surfacing that there will be a party system in the game, and I understand why. In his final demo of the show, Richard stated (and this is paraphrased, if it's inaccurate blame me, not him) that the party was "in the game" and would be helping you to complete your tasks. This does not mean that there is a party system in the game; rather, you will be visiting familiar friends throughout the game who will be helping you in your quests. It has also been previously reported that at various times in the game you would assume the roles of party members, for instance Lord British, in order to accomplish certain tasks. As for a more traditional party, as in multiple NPCs joining your company and visibly following you throughout the game, I saw and heard nothing to indicate that this would be the case.<BR><BR>

<B>Is it role playing?</B><BR><BR>

This is a topic of much debate, and one that begs the larger question - what is a RPG? I am not going to tackle that particular issue here, but I will state that my view on this relates to the CRPG genre, and not the broader definition of "role playing". That is, computer games that evolved from the golden age of gaming with the purpose of replacing dice rolls with more visual statistical information. Pioneers in this field would be the Ultima series, the Wizardry series, the Bard's Tale games, Dungeon Master, and on the Unix side includes games like Hack, Larn and Rogue. Recent entries to this genre include Might and Magic 6, Fallout, Halls of the Dead (Faery Tale Adventure 2), and Diablo.<BR><BR>

So the answer to this question, which I posted in a previous update, is "no". While you could consider the gameplay (and potential gameplay based on reported plans for the game) role playing in a broad sense, it does not meet up with what I would consider traditional CRPG elements. This is based on what I have seen of the game, and of the plans that have been made public for its completion.<BR><BR>

Now, if you want to be pedantic and say that a "role playing game" comprises any game that allows you to take the role of a generic avatar and interact with the world, fine. Be prepared to include all current and planned first person perspective games in that category as well, whether they are action, CRPGs or adventure. Simply taking the dictionary definition of the phrase "role playing" does not define the genre that exists in computer entertainment today.<BR><BR>

Much of the confusion comes from Origin's waffling on categorizing Ultima: Ascension. The press release clearly states that the game is "Fantasy Action-Adventure", however the term "role-playing" is mentioned nearly as much, albeit in smaller type than the former. My guess is that Origin does not want to alienate any segment of their market, so they're trying to cover all bases. The attitude was similar at the show. While the marketing representatives were quick to shun certain elements of CRPGs, they were just as quick to say that the game is classic role playing, which it most certainly is not. One description that was popular around the Origin booth was the term "hard-core", which was usually mentioned with regard to statistics or inventory management.<BR><BR>

Could Ultima: Ascension become a true CRPG from where it stands now? Absolutely. However, I believe this is in conflict with some of the ideas that the designers want to implement. More on this later.<BR><BR>

<B>Is there an inventory system or not?</B><BR><BR>

As reported earlier, the press information states that "There are no hard-core stats or inventory management; nothing to take away from the fun, just compelling adventure and intense action." This would imply that there is no inventory system. How could there possibly be an Ultima game without a backpack?<BR><BR>

It is difficult to say what the answer is. Michael Morlan, a senior artist on Ultima: Ascension, said that there would be gumps in the game, for items such as containers. Richard Garriott himself stated that there would be a backpack that you could drop your items into and rearrange them.<BR><BR>

However, Ed Del Castillo said that the inventory system wasn't decided yet, and that several systems were being considered, none of which fully suited what they had in mind. Ed described the inventory systems from several different role playing games and action games, and talked a bit about their strengths and weaknesses, before finally saying that it was still up in the air.<BR><BR>

There were no inventory functions at all in the demo shown at E3.<BR><BR>

<B>Paperdolls?</B><BR><BR>

The existence of a paperdoll system is still apparently up in the air. Richard at one point described a method of turning the Avatar toward the camera and dressing him by dragging objects over his body, but this was not available at E3.<BR><BR>

<B>Details on the E3 demo</B><BR><BR>

I should briefly note that the game engine being demonstrated was being described as pre-alpha in nature. There was some visual pop-up on the horizon, depending on the area, and there were a few crashes, although I would not describe these as frequent. The game play was also a bit choppy. Ed Del Castillo described the machines being used as P2-300s with 64 megs of ram, and each machine had a Voodoo 2 card installed.<BR><BR>

There was no paperdoll system, no means for the Avatar to pick up items and hold them in inventory, no visible interface for spells, and I never saw the Avatar die. There was no visual indication of health or other statistics, and there were no overlay windows for functions of any kind. As I said, "pre-alpha".<BR><BR>

The E3 demo started with a location menu superimposed over the "rising Avatar" image frequently associated with Ultima: Ascension. The towns listed were:<BR><BR>

<LI>Stonegate<BR> 
<LI>Britain<BR> 
<LI>Asylum<BR> 
<LI>Moonglow<BR> 
<LI>Dungeon<BR> 
<LI>Cove<BR><BR>
 
Clicking on one of these names would start the game in that location. Movement was accomplished by maneuvering a cursor around the screen.<BR><BR>

How large was the demo? Michael Morlan estimated that the demo area is about the size of one real Ultima: Ascension town. Other Origin representatives gave similar estimates. If this is true, then the world will be extremely large and very satisfying to explore.<BR><BR>

This is doubly impressive due to the fact that there is no loading between areas in Ultima: Ascension. You can theoretically continue walking until you have circumnavigated the globe. If they can pull off this kind of a seamless world with the same detail of the demo, and with a world the size of what is being estimated, then the engine will move from evolutionary to revolutionary. The polygon details of the levels were at least as good as similar action games (insert the dreaded Q word here), but with the added benefit of the areas not being individual "levels". The fact that the entire world is seamlessly connected was pointed out several times during the demos that were given, and is obviously a strong point of the game.<BR><BR>

Lighting effects were put to good use. One popular demo maneuver was to pick up a lantern and move it around the room. As the lantern moved, the light source followed the lantern around very convincingly. Night and day were also well supported, with night in particular giving a real feeling of atmosphere to some of the lantern-lit towns. I also witnessed some very nice environmental effects such as the magical fence erected around Moonglow that resembled the Aurora Borealis, and a lighthouse that sported volumetric lighting that rotated.<BR><BR>

As mentioned previously, the Avatar can now swim. I saw two areas with deep enough water to swim in, one inside of a cave and another on a beach. The cave area had skeletons nearby, and when the Avatar entered the water, the skeletons pursued and continued to fight while swimming. The beach had a more realistic aquatic predator - a giant crab.<BR><BR>

<B>The New Magic</B><BR><BR>

Magic was all done via key presses or potions, and there were no other spell mechanisms in evidence. Michael Morlan stated that you could mix reagants for spells, and once you learn spells you can assign them to a hotkey and forego reagant mixing.<BR><BR>

The spell effects I saw were attractive. The spells I saw demonstrated were:<BR><BR>

<LI>Infernal Armor - This made the Avatar glow, and apparently damaged any creatures that got close enough <BR><BR>

<LI>Ring of Fire - A demo-givers favorite, this spell was used to destroy any nearby creatures. The effect was attractive, but not nearly as attractive as in the screenshot on the official page<BR><BR> 

<LI>Invisibility - The Avatar gestures, a circular ring moves over his body, and he becomes transparent<BR><BR>
 
<LI>Fireball - Another demo-givers favorite, this was used to knock crates and objects around, demonstrating the physics engine<BR><BR> 

<LI>Light - A ball of light appears over the Avatar and follows him around, illuminating the area<BR><BR> 

<B>Technical Notes</B><BR><BR>

At this time, the engine is planned as GLIDE based, with a software rasterizer planned. As mentioned previously, all demo machines at E3 were running with Voodoo 2 cards.<BR><BR>

<B>Plot Notes</B><BR><BR>

The time frame of Ultima: Ascension is, as suspected, directly after Pagan. The Avatar returns to Britannia to find the world destroyed, and huge columns are ripping the world apart in key locations of the world. The runes of virtue have been subverted by the Guardian, and the Britannian moons are pulling the columns through the earth, destroying continents in their wake. The world may be split into north and south continents.<BR><BR>

Lord British's health is tied to the land, and as such he is ailing. Your job, in part, will be to restore the runes of virtue.<BR><BR>

Briefly mentioned was the fact that there are eight virtues, and eight circles of spells.<BR><BR>

Ed Del Castillo stated that from the outset it was planned to do an ultima about the Avatar, rather than a game about Iolo, Shamino, or other former party members.<BR><BR>

It is currently planned for the Avatar to start the game in Stonegate tower, where you will receive a tutorial, and then move on to Britain. Your sidekick Raven will, at the appropriate time, take you to Asylum. In this way the game will start out linear but open up as you gain more means of travel.<BR><BR>

<B>Gameplay Notes</B><BR><BR>

Note that most of the information presented here is planned; none of it was in evidence at E3.<BR><BR>

The skill system used in Ultima: Ascension will be progressive. For instance, you start with a jabbing attack with a sword. In time you learn other maneuvers, such as how to slash. Some sword skills will be more useful against particular adversaries than others, for example jabbing is no good for skeletons because the sword slides right between their bones.<BR><BR>

In my talks with Ed Del Castillo, I found that the concept of this progressive skill system owes a lot to Command and COnquer, another game that Del Castillo worked on. In C&C you cannot build every unit from the outset of the game, but as the game progresses you gain the ability to add more varied and specialized units. This is the sort of incremental system that Ed wants to apply to Ultima: Ascension. Unlike Ultima Online, Ultima; Ascension's list of skills will unfold over time.<BR><BR>

Richard Garriott stated plainly that they are not trying to compete with other first person games like Unreal or Duke Nukem.<BR><BR>

<B>A few other items of interest</B><BR><BR>

<LI>On whether or not Origin is feeling any pressure from Electronic Arts (I mentioned Ultima Online at this point) to release Ultima: Ascension by a specific date: Ed Del Castillo says absolutely none, and that the product will not ship before it is finished, plain and simple. If it isn't ready by Christmas (or any other date), then it won't come out then.<BR><BR> 

Ed expanded on the above by stating that he wants to sell a million copies of Ultima: Ascension. However, this does not mean that his goals are purely financial or numeric; rather, he wants to create a product of such high quality that it reaches the million selling range on its own merits, and that the fact that it sells that many copies will simply be a testament to how good it is.<BR><BR> 

<LI>On the subject of baking bread - Richard Garriott said that if an item is not part of the plot (ie. bread baking), that there are tons of other things that can take the place of it that would be plot related. This was apparently a rationalization for the exclusion of some of the non-plot critical activities that have been present in previous Ultimas.<BR><BR> 

<LI>Regarding what Ultimas he has finished, Ed Del Castillo says that he has finished Ultima 3, Ultima 5, and almost finished Ultima 6.<BR><BR> 

<LI>Richard Garriott was wearing his serpent necklace. Ed Del Castillo was wearing an eye patch and black boots with flames on the toes.<BR><BR>
 
<LI>The current timetable for the public demo is to have it finished by the end of June.<BR><BR> 

<LI>There are plans to fill the three design positions that were currently left open.<BR><BR>
 
<LI>Ed advises his staff to stop reading the web or email when criticism becomes common. I tried to discuss this more with him, explaining that the quality of Ultima Online is a large reason surrounding this, not to mention how long it has been since the release of a "real" Ultima, but I don't think I made much of an impact.<BR><BR> 

I pointed out that Ed had not previously designed a hugely successful RPG. Ed pointed out that he had not designed a hugely successful strategy game before Command and Conquer. Touche.<BR><BR> 

<B>And finally...some opinion</B><BR><BR>

Listening to Ed Del Castillo talk about his plans for the completion of Ultima: Ascension is somewhat like the hobbits must have felt while talking to Saruman in Lord of the Rings (obligatory geek reference). The more he talked, the more it all made sense and sounded good.<BR><BR>

Of course, I've been back from E3 for a while now and been thinking quite a bit about what I would write here, and I can say one thing: if Ultima: Ascension ships with all of the planned inclusions, it is going to be one hell of a game. I still don't believe it will be as full of an experience as it could be if it were given a traditional RPG treatment, but nevertheless it will be a game that I want to play.<BR><BR>

After talking to members of the team I am convinced that they are on a set path to the end of Ultima: Ascension and that they are going to complete it according to their vision, and no amount of petitions for parties or female Avatars is going to change this. Because of this I am going to give them a break here and stop harping on every minor detail that mentions an action oriented feature. I actually think it will be interesting to see how well the ideas that were discussed (progressive skills, emphasis on adventure/action) will unfold in their final implementation.<BR><BR>

As for real CRPGs: I think that true fans of the genre (the "hardcore" if you will) are going to have to look elsewhere for their satisfaction, if that is all they crave. The biggest danger that Ultima: Ascension faces is trying to straddle too many fences. It has action elements, but at E3 I saw Heretic 2 demonstrating a first person view similar to Ultima: Ascension, but with better effects and more action. CRPG enthusiasts can look forward to Might and Magic 7, or the next instalment in the Wizardry series, or Diablo 2, all of which will have more traditional CRPG elements than Ultima: Ascension. If Ultima: Ascension combines mediocre versions of each of these genres, the end result will be a tedious game that doesn't take a firm hold in either fan base.</I><BR><BR>

Thanks, Mental4!<BR><BR>
