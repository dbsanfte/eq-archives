<U>28 November 1997</U><br><br>

My swordsman character continues to inch his way up toward grandmaster status.  At times, though, the rate of advancement is maddningly slow.  I seem to have hit a nearly vertical advancement curve, and have only increased my swordsmanship skill by one point in over three days of play.  That's fine, but I wish there was some way to actually be told that your skill is still increasing or if you've hit some form of glass ceiling.  I feel it would also be useful to have the player be made aware of when an action actually raises or lowers your notoriety.<br><br>

For instance, since my character was created I've attacked nothing that would decrease my notoriety, and have made it all the way to master swordsman status without my notoriety changning from neutral.  In a fit of desperation after spending all day today killing trolls, ettins, and gazers I and not seeing an increase in notoriety I broke down and gave a gold piece (one gold piece) to a beggar and I suddenly became Honorable.  I can now say that I am a staunch supporter of giving money to the poor at every opportunity.<br><br>

I just want to say on the record that Origin's introduction of the Chaos/Order knights is the first addition to Ultima Online that actually made me say "cool."  I hope that this marks the start of the inclusion of actual depth and goals to the game, beyond merely maxing out your character.<BR><BR>

<U>25 November 1997</U><BR><BR>

I'm still *slowly* inching my way toward Grandmaster swordsman status.  At this point I'm averaging about a point skill point per day increase, which seems like a fair rate.  My notoriety remains unchanged, which is distressing, because it seems like a player is likely to tire of playing a character before the benefits (or liabilities) of notoriety will kick in.<BR><BR>

I have noticed in the way I play, and seemingly in the play of others, that once a character reaches a certain height in development Ultima Online seems to become a game of habit.  Not habit in the sense of compulsion to play, but habit in the sense that I find myself on a sort of patrol from one area to the next to the next where I know there are likely to be monsters.  In fact, the few players that I actually see when I play are those that I frequently run into at the same points in my patrol the same time each day.<BR><BR>

Now that Origin seems to be involving something of a storyline into Ultima Online one thing that I would really like to see would be some sort of knightly order for high-level characters.  It would give me more of an incentive to increase my character's proficiency other than knowing that I'll be one of the baddest bruisers in Britannia.  Something like "The Knightly Order of the Virtues" or somesuch thing would be nice, with entry into the order dependent on the successful completion of a quest.<BR><BR>

After I hit Grandmaster level I've decided that I'll buy a boat with some of the vast amounts of money in my bank account.  I haven't traveled to any of the outer islands yet, but I think it would be neat to retire on the Isle of the Avatar.<BR><BR>

<U>21 November 1997</U><BR><BR>

I've finally made it to Master Swordsman status.  *whew*  After what I did today, I'm positive that the notoriety system does not allow you to increase your notoriety from base or it does so at such a slow rate that it isn't noticible.  I took out three orcs camps, two ratman camps, three ettins, and three trolls in the space of two hours and I'm still not honorable.<BR><BR>

Now that my character's end is in sight, I'm really not sure of where to go from there.  Once you hit Grandmaster, there really isn't much else to do.  With my GM Archer character, most things were dead before they even got close to me, and it's pretty much the same now with my Master Swordsman character.  If something can't use magic against me, it's pretty much dead.  This is, essentially, the problem I see with Ultima Online:  there isn't much to it once you go past the swords and sorcery veneer.  Sure, there are all the professional classes but how many people actually play them?  In reality, there are only two classes in UO, mages and warriors.<BR><BR>

Even though Origin has tried to add depth to UO, all that it's really been has been to give some small purpose to the hacking and slashing.  When I used to DM back in the pen and paper days, I never had to give a purpose to the combat in the game because that was the job of the story.  Origin has always had such a good track record in coming up with great stories in their games I sometimes think that they must be holding back with Ultima Online because they have something big in the works, but I'm beginning to doubt it.  I don't doubt because I feel that Origin is no longer capable of telling a good story (I have high hopes for Ultima IX), but rather I feel that because of its nature Ultima Online is not suited to maintaining an ongoing storyline.  Ultima Online maintaining an ongoing storyline is like trying to DM a group where the players are different everytime you get together.<BR><BR>

<U>20 November 1997</U><BR><BR>

My swordsman character continues on his way, inching ever closer to Grandmaster status.  I haven't had the time to play as much as I would have liked to lately, but I must admit that I do like what I'm beginning to see as far as the new patches are concerned.  I'm enthused about the new bounty system, as well as the new monster spawning Origin seems to have included.  Whether these will help curb the player killing problem in the game is uncertain, but it certainly can't hurt.<BR><BR>

One thing that sort of bothers me is the advancement rate of the new notoriety system.  My character is just shy of Master swordsman status (89% swordsmanship), and I've never trained on a dummy or player killed, and my notoriety still is neutral.  I mean I've killed mountains of orcs, waves of ettins and trolls, and I'm still not honorable.  Oh well.<BR><BR>

<U>14 November 1997</U><BR><BR>

I'm still slogging away in my attempts to build my swordsman up to Grandmaster status, and even though Origin seems to have gotten monster spawning under control it seems to have come at the cost of server stability (at least on Atlantic).  I have never seen, even in the beta tests, a server that has been so unstable as Atlantic has been today.  The server has crashed six times today, and I can't tell you how many times I've lost connection for no ascertainable reason.  The only saving grace is that Origin pulled out the stat penalty for death yesterday, because my character died during one of the downtimes.<BR><BR>

Even with the increased monster spawning, the game rapidly settles into a monotony of running from one monster to the next in order to build up one's skills.  The only quest that I've seen so far in the game was when I stumbled upon a ratman camp that was holding an NPC prisoner.  After killing the ratmen, the NPC told me that I'd be rewarded if I freed him from his chains and returned him to town.  I freed him, and he started to follow me back to town, but then the NPC seems to have "forgotten" the quest and stopped following me.  Oh well, half a quest is better than none at all.<BR><BR>

<U>13 November 1997</U><BR><BR>

My swordsman character is now an Adept, and I have come up against very few monsters that pose any real threat.  The only real threat, it seems, for higher level characters comes from player killers.  However, with the new patch and the fact that professions are no longer listed on your paperdoll most player killers seem slightly off balance because their ability to pick targets seems to have been cut off at the knees.  I haven't any doubt, though, that they will come up with a new system.<BR><BR>

With the new patch, Origin seems to have really given monster and animal spawning a real kick in the pants.  Twice today, I have been pushed back by actual waves of Orcs that came pouring out of the woods toward me.  The first time, a newbie player was out wandering far east of Yew, when he came running toward me asking for help.  Before he could finish typing, six Orcs poured out of the treeline.  I swatted the Orcs down, but before I could even begin looting their bodies a wave of five Orc Captains poured out of the woods.  After all the Orcs were dead, and I was laden with gold and other booty, I decided to head to Britain to do a bank run.<BR><BR>

Traveling along the roads is probably the quickest way to run into player killers, so I always travel parallel to the roads through the woods.  I was running through the fields to the west of the Yew/Britain/Skara Brae crossroads when all of a sudden monsters began pouring out of the woods in every direction.  A wave of Orcs came at me as an archer on horseback galloped past with a small army of zombies after him.  I killed the Orcs and headed south, when a pack of giant scorpions and spiders came out of the treeline toward me.  As I was killing the bugs, newbies ran past with a small group of trolls in tow.  I sprinted after the trolls after the bugs were finished, and caught up with one that was surrounded with bodies.  A few quick hits from by halbred brought the troll down, but it cost me my breast plate, which was destroyed in the fight.  I sprinted into town, giving the roving mobs of monsters wide berth.<BR><BR>

It's occurred to me that it really isn't very hard at all to make a lot of money in Ultima Online.  With my new character, who has only been around for a week or so, I've been able to put about 11,000 gold in the bank as well as being able to equip my character with full plate and halbreds.  It really isn't that hard, but it's something I've noticed that not many people actually do: get meat from *everything* you kill.  Practically everything can be skinned after you kill it, and you can sell meat in taverns, inns, and butcher shops.  The butcher shops in Yew and Britain have bought all the meat I had each and every time I stopped by, and it's a quick way to make a lot of cash.<BR><BR>

While the solutions that Origin has introducted to try and curb player killers are a partial step in the right direction, it seems that if they just remove the rewards to player killing it would stop being fun.  If you're player killed, the player killer should gain no stat or skill increase (and you should not lose yours when you res) and all equipment on you should stay on your ghost, with nothing left behind for the player killer to loot.  This way, Origin can claim to allow players the right to do anything they want in the game, but will not reward player killers or punish the victims.<BR><BR>

<U>11 November 1997</U><BR><BR>

My character is still going strong, and is already an Expert Swordsman in just four days.  It really does seem that Ultima Online really is skewed to favoring classic roleplaying classes (like warriors and wizards) over the new classes introduced in Ultima Online, like the lumberjack, shepherd, or blacksmith.  While it is relatively easy to excel as a warrior, it is near to impossible to be able to gain high levels of proficiency in any of the trade classes, and this is one of Ultima Online's
rapidly emerging drawbacks.<BR><BR>

Player characters are rapidly become homogenous, with almost everyone on Atlantic shard being a fighter/mage combination.  This trend seems to have been brought on by the rash of player killer activity on Atlantic, and it's a shame because it really does take a lot of spice out of the game.  However, Origin seems to be in no hurry to actually make the game better for the majority of players.<BR><BR>

Something that is approaching on the horizon that I feel is frightening in terms of gameplay impact is the introduction of resurrection penalties, where every form of resurrection will carry a stat deduction based on notoriety.  Beside the fact the notoriety is broken and reflects nothing but the player's willingness or ability to artifically manipulate it, the idea of penalizing players further because they are killed is salting the wound as far as I'm concerned.  If my character is player killed, not only will I face the annoyance of having my gaming experience ruined but I will also be penalized for having died at the hands of someone who is likely exploiting the grossly unbalanced magic system or other loopholes.  Players should not be doubly penalized due to Origin's inability or unwillingness to keep its game in order.  It is clear that magic is much too powerful, but instead of trying to balance an existing element of the game, Origin is now introducing a new element that will punish players further because of existing imbalances.  Not only is this a shortsighted move on their part, it also does nothing but serve to alienate players (at least one that I know of) from their product.<BR><BR>

Ultima Online might be an Ultima from Origin's point of view, but it certainly isn't one in mine.  With nothing more to look forward to than an endless series of flawed patches, half-hearted attempts to reign in players who actively seek to harass players who think they're playing an Ultima, and nothing to look forward to but an endless series of forays into the woods looking for monsters that aren't there and avoiding the player killers who are, I'm actually sad to admit that I'm starting to imagine life after Ultima Online.<BR><BR>

<U>7 November 1997</U><BR><BR>

Okay, so there I was happily playing my blacksmith character.  I wasn't hurting anyone, and was even handing out free weapons and armor to the folks who asked nicely.  A couple days passed as I continued to build up my blacksmith, and I thought to myself, "Gee, this is really great.  I can play UO the way I want to play it."  Then the patch came.<BR><BR>

Seemingly never one to leave something alone when it wasn't broken, part of the latest patch released by Origin completely ruins the mining skill by making it take many times longer to mine, adds a useless animation, and auto-stacks ore in your backpack when it's mined.  Trapped by these changes to the mining skill, miners are forced to stay longer and longer periods of time outside of the justice areas and are easy prey to player killers, who are taking quick advantage of the changes to the magic system.  "Just hide from them," you say -- not with the new AllNames macro.  With just a punch of a key player killers are now alerted to your presence regardless of whatever measures you might have taken to conceal yourself.<BR><BR>

Basically, what it boils down to is that until Origin decides to grow the 'nads to actually take a strong stance on the player killing issue, all they will ever do is simply play catch-up with the player killers.  Patch after patch after patch has seen player killer loophole after loophole close, only to have new ones open as each new feature is put in.  Since player killers seemingly spend their time playing doing nothing more than trying to figure out ways around Origin's rules, Origin will never, ever be able to stop them short of simply making it impossible for one player to kill another player.  Do player killers add anything to the game that an Orc Captain or the occassional Lich doesn't?  No, imho.  Do they add anything constructive to the game, or do actually work against the feelings of community that Origin hoped to create within the game?  I don't know about you, but it's gotten to the point where I actually avoid interacting with other players outside of the justice areas.  Was this what Origin wanted?  Origin might have put in cute little bounty rewards, or made it so your stuff disappears off your corpse when you die, but Origin seems to have forgotten that most player killers don't do it for the gold, or do it for the stuff, they do it because they're assholes.  They're going to do it until they can't do it anymore.  Period.<BR><BR>

Has Origin forgotten what Ultima is all about?  At least with Ultima Online, it seems like they have.  In their attempts to try and avoid alienating any of their potential subscribers, Origin has seemingly turned their backs on Ultima's bedrock principles and have allowed it to become nothing more than a glorified Quake TC.  In all the years that I've played Ultima, and I've played them a long, long time, I have always associated it in my mind with the striving for virtue, the exploration of the self, and a marked departure from other CRPGs.  Sadly, though, Ultima Online just does not pass muster.  I would like to spend my time online playing as a blacksmith, or in study trying to master magery, but that's not possible in Ultima Online as it now stands.  If I want to be able to play the game at all I have to play as a warrior, or a character that can stand up against the attacks of the player killers.  It's a shame that I have to develop my character to the point of his being able to butcher psychotically before I can take on the robes of a mage, or the simple crook of a shepherd, but it seems that that's the way Origin wants it.<BR><BR>

I can accept that, but I want Origin to know that it's not fun.<BR><BR>

<U>5 November 1997</U><BR><BR>

It was almost with a sense of relief that I retired both of my thief characters.  In all the classes that I've played in Ultima Online, none need more work to better balance the class than the thief does.  Basically, being a successful thief is next to impossible.<br><br>

With the notoriety system the way that it is, a thief character will go from neutral to Dark Lord within minutes from just peeking into another player's backpack.  Not stealing anything, mind you, just peeking.  This seems to me to be an example of how much work that still needs to go into the notoriety system.  Titles should be granted for acts of real good or real evil, and not for small things such as peeking into a backpack.  As it stands, notoriety has far too many loopholes and has gotten to the point where a character's notoriety is absolutely no indication of what kind of character is it.<BR><BR>

Another problem with thieving is that the primary thieving skill -- Stealing -- is treated just like any other skill, where you have to wait between uses of the skill.  If archers, or warriors, or mages, or miners, or carpenters don't have to wait between uses of their primary class skill then thieves shouldn't either.  If I have your backpack open without your knowing, I should be able to rob you blind as quickly as I can click the button and target an item.  This isn't a popular thing to fix I'm certain, but the real goal is to make Ultima Online as balanced a game in all respects as possible.<BR><BR>

Another problem with being a thief is that your skills rise at an incredibly slow rate.  In three whole days of playing as a thief (and stealing 1,589 gold pieces total from many, many players) my stealing skill went up one whole point.  Now I realize that someone shouldn't become a grandmaster overnight, but one point every three days is ridiculous.  Although no one wants the game to be overly easy, I believe it is necessary for the players to see some steady improvement in used skills or there will be no incentive to continue playing.  As it is, I do not have the patience to continue to play a thief and I consider myself to be a patient fellow.  With new players coming into the game all the time, improving the learning curve for a profession will certainly keep new players interested.<BR><BR>

The final critique I have of the thief is that it is far, far too difficult to steal in towns.  Now I realize that towns are supposed to be safe havens, but what medieval city was safe and crime-free?  If a thief sucessfully steals an item from a player's backpack, then the thief should go undetected.  I feel that players should only notice the thief's activity when the thief is unsuccessful in stealing an item.  I know it's not a popular suggestion, but what I'm seeking is balance in the game.<br><br>

There are a couple of things that I have learned from being a thief that will safe a lot of you some grief in the future:<br><br>

<LI>Always, always keep items in bags in your backpack.  Thieves cannot open a bag or backpack that is already in a backpack, and if you make each container heavy enough they will not be able to steal anything from you.<br><br>

<LI>Always, always open a player's paperdoll when they approach you.  I cannot tell you how many times I was able to steal from the same people because I would rob them, then hide behind a tree and change clothes, then come back and rob them again.  Most thieves have many changes of clothing on them, so check their paperdolls first.<br><br>

<LI>Use your safe deposit box at the bank to hold everything you don't need regularly.  The box is free, and I've never been able to fill one to its limit so they seem to have a huge amount of storage space.<BR><BR>

<LI>Lastly, if you can't get your hands on a bag or backpack to keep things in pick up a fur or two.  Thieves can move things around in your backpack, but only a little, so they'll have trouble seeing what's under a fur or two.  If you cover your stuff with furs you should be alright.<BR><BR>

The character I've been playing for the last couple of days is a blacksmith, so I'm kind of going back to my beta test roots for awhile.  It's a nice, quiet way to play the game, and now that I've got a lot of experience with the game under my belt it should be a whole lot more fun this time around.
