The endgame sequence of Ultima VIII: Pagan shows the Avatar escaping from the doomed world and appearing in a Britannia that is completely unfamiliar to him.  The sky glows oppressively and hangs low over a riotous scene of lava, broken landscapes, and flights of dragons circling a giant mountain carved into the Guardian's likeness.    Recognizing neither himself nor the Britannia he had fought so long to protect, the Avatar can only stand and gape at the changes that occurred during his absence.  In many ways I feel that long-time Ultima fans are now finding themselves in a similar situation with regard to Ultima: Ascension.<BR><BR>

If there is one true thing that can be said of Ultima: Ascension it is that it marks a pivotal turning point in the keystone series of the role-playing genre and, like most change, it is being met with considerable resistance and suspicion.<BR><BR>

The Ultima series, as a whole, enjoys a history that few other computer role-playing game series can match.  From the foundation building of the first trilogy, the philosophical advances in the second, and the technological advances in the third, Ultima has forced the role-playing genre itself to evolve in ways that it would not have otherwise.  In short, the role-playing genre we enjoy today would not exist if it were not for Ultima.<BR><BR>

Ultima has always been on the cutting edge of the role-playing genre and for a long time dictated the style of subsequent role-playing games with each new entry into the series.  Confident in its pride of place, Ultima was one of the last breakwaters as time passed, other gaming trends grew, and the prominence of the role-playing genre slowly eroded away.  Even in the midst of a dwindling marketplace, Ultima could always be counted on each time it appeared on the shelves.  However, as with all things, even Ultima was bound to stumble.<BR><BR>

By the time Ultima VIII: Pagan appeared on shelves in 1994, Ultima returned to find the marketplace vastly changed from the high water mark of the role-playing genre.  No longer certain of itself it grasped furtively to regain its footing and the result was a game that pleased virtually no one.  Faced with the realization that Ultima could no longer be supported by the role-playing genre alone, Ultima disappeared to lick its wounds and make plans for Ultima IX.<BR><BR>

While work was underway on Ultima IX the role-playing genre underwent something it had never seen before - its virtual collapse.  Through a combination of both a shrinking marketplace and the fact that role-playing games require more development time and cost than other genres, fewer and fewer role-playing games appeared on the shelves each year until they were a mere trickle.  The very depth and complexity that was the hallmark of the role-playing genre was exposed as its Achilles heel and soon only the most hardcore developers could be counted on to continue in the genre's traditions - but even these games met with lukewarm success in the overall marketplace.<BR><BR>

Very quickly, the few relative successes role-playing could muster appeared as a result of cross-pollination as the differentiation between genres began to blur, and it was into this marketplace that Ultima: Ascension was to emerge.  Reappearing as a synthesis of genres and leaving its "pure" role-playing roots behind, Ultima: Ascension did the only thing that Ultima could do in order to survive in its new reality - it evolved.  Stripping away that which was deemed unnecessary, Ultima became a leaner, more-focused game because it had to prepare itself to do the one thing that Ultima has never had to do before - to compete in the marketplace or prepare to be killed off.<BR><BR>

Like the bewildered Avatar in the Ultima VIII: Pagan endgame sequence, long-term Ultima fans are faced with the sudden realization that there is no return to the past and neither are they fully prepared to press on.  Stripped of any semblance of familiarity, the return of Ultima is no longer the cherished and long-awaited return to Britannia but the tentative first steps into a world that many fans feel they no longer know.  For many fans Ultima loses its soul the minute their emotional connection to the land is severed, other fans feel a sense of exhilaration at the prospect of experiencing Britannia in a way never before possible, and a third group waits patiently hoping to be surprised but prepared for disappointment.  No matter what camp of fans we find ourselves in we must accept the fact that Ultima must change in order to survive or we must come to grips with the fact that either Ultima has outgrown us or we have outgrown Ultima.<BR><BR>
