<BR><BR>
<LI>It's not much news, but Brian Martin has confirmed that a full team is now back working on Ultima IX.
<BR><BR>
<LI>In the November 1997 issue of <I>Gamestar</I>, a german gaming magazine, Lord British spoke briefly about Ultima IX:<BR><BR>

<I>Q: "Whats the current status on U9, since it was delayed because of UO?"<BR><BR>

A: "Well, we'll be back on u9 soon. Right now it needs a 3d Accelerator
and it will support 3d Sound. Most of the code for all the physical
stuff is finished, so i guess we will make it for a summer 98 release"</I><BR><BR>

Thanks Waterfall Dragon!<BR><BR>

<LI>Lord British was a bit talkative about Ultima IX at this year's E3.  These are the tidbits he dropped in the various interviews he gave during the show:<BR><BR>
<I>Lord British <EM>stressed</EM> that Ultima IX was back on track after the Ultima Online related delay, and should appear on shelves by the summer of 1998.<BR><BR>
He also revealed that Ultima IX would <B>require</B> a 3D accelerator card to be able to run the game -- one of the first high-profile games to have such a requirement.  He did not state which card they would recommend.</I>
<BR><BR>
<LI>This news item appeared recently on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.ogr.com" TARGET="_parent">Online Gaming Review</A> page:<BR><BR>

<EM>Electronic Arts announced today the appointment of two industry veterans, Neil Young and Chris Yates, both former Virgin Interactive executives, to manage the company's Texas-based studio, Origin Systems. Neil Young will serve as vice president and general manager of Origin, and Chris Yates will serve as vice president and chief technology officer at Origin.</EM><BR><BR>

What effect this will have on the development of Ultima IX remains to be seen.<BR><BR>

<LI>In in interview on <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.ogr.com" TARGET=_parent">Online Gaming Review</A>, Lord British indicated that Origin's plan is now to have Ultima IX out by the end of their current fiscal year, which is March 1998.  However, he indicated that since no one was presently working on Ultima IX it would probably be later than that.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The latest issue of <I>PC Gamer</I> (as of 18 March) has a small section about Ultima IX:
<BR><BR>
<I>After much prodding from fans, Ultima IX will pause while the player searches through inventory.</I>
<BR><BR>
<I>Seagoing ships will be drawn to scale.</I>
<BR><BR>
<I>Reagents are now in containers that automaticaly organize and optimize their contents.  There will be slots in a bag for each reagent, with its symbol and quantity easily available.  A money purse will likewise handle wealth, and key rings will provide the proper key if you have that key in your party.</I>  
<BR><BR>
<LI>In the February 1997 issue of the German gaming magazine <EM>PowerPlay</EM> there was a large preview of Ultima IX.  Of particular interest are these tidbits:
<BR><BR><EM>
After much clamoring for it on the part of Ultima fans, The Avatar will be able to swim in Ultima IX.<BR><BR>
They also detailed the real-world physics that Origin has sought to introduce into Ultima IX, giving two examples.  For instance, if you fire an arrow and it misses, it will stick upright in the ground until it is retrieved.  In addition, if you throw an empty barrel into water it will float on the surface.  If the barrel is partially filled, it will float lower in the water.  Finally, if the barrel is full it will sink to the bottom.</EM>
<BR><BR>
<LI>In the January 1997 issue of the UK gaming magazine <I>Edge</I> there was a <EM>very</EM> enthusiastic preview of Ultima IX.  Of particular interest were these tidbits:
<BR><BR><EM>
At this point the Ultima IX engine runs at 25 frames per second on a Pentium 100 in 640x480 SVGA.
<BR><BR>
Each screen is built from anywhere between 2,000 and 3,000 individual polygons.
<BR><BR>
Britannia is 256 screenlengths in width and 256 screenlengths in height.
<BR><BR></EM>
<LI>Brian Martin, the Project Leader for Ultima IX, recently announced that portions of the Ultima IX team had been temporarily transferred over to work on the Ultima Online project.  Brian pointed out that this reallocation of personnel was only until Ultima Online was brought to the beta level.  The effect of these transfers on Ultima IX's release date is unknown.
<BR><BR>
Here is the text of his statement:

Ultima 9 has not, I repeat HAS NOT been cut. Due to our commitment to<BR>
Ultima Online, we are focusing our resources on that project. Many of<BR>

working on Ulitma Online. As soon as Ultima Online has reached beta, the<BR>
Ultima 9 folks, including some of the Ultima Online people, will come<BR>
back over to Ultima 9. <BR><BR>
Please, PLEASE copy this message over to the Ultima Dragons board. For<BR>
some whacko reason, I can not post to news groups at the moment. Give my<BR>
assurances to all of our fans that Ultima 9 has not been cut. Believe<BR>
me, those of us who have put our hearts and souls into U9 want to see it<BR>
on store shelves as much as the fans do, (maybe more).</EM> <BR>
<BR>
<LI>This is what Lord British had to say about Ultima IX in the Austin 360 AM Chat Lord British:<BR><BR>
<EM>Ultima IX will run on anything from a Pentium 90 on up.  A Pentium 133 with 16 MB of RAM is recommended, though.
<BR><BR>
The music for Ultima IX will be streamed directly off the of the CD-ROM.  The special effects in the game will all be digital.</EM>
<BR><BR>
<LI>This is what Lord British had to say about Ultima IX in the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="arcadian.html">Arcadian Chat with Lord British</A>.<BR><BR>
<EM>U4 had the coolest premise...<BR>
U5 was far better told, with better greys
   between good and evil...<BR>
U6 had the best plot twist with the
   Gargoyles...<BR>
U7 had the best world detail of
   interaction...<BR>
U8 had the best animation and detail...<BR>
And U9 will beat all of these in the ways
   that each of them were best!!!</EM>   
<BR><BR>
<LI>According to Lord British, Dupre <EM>will</EM> have a cameo appearance in Ultima IX.
<BR><BR>
<LI>Here's what Brian Martin had to say about the state (and definition of) the Ultima IX game engine:
<BR><BR>
<EM>I get the feeling from the way end users use the word engine that your 
definition of the word is different from ours. Therefore, I am not certain 
how to answer this question. I can say that the majority of the games 
systems and features have been written. However, there are more to be 
written. I keep seeing people saying things like, "The engine is almost 
written, so the game should be out soon". Well, that's not true. You see, 
after all of the systems and features have been done, there is still a lot 
of building and implementation left to do. A lot. Believe me, it takes a 
long time for us designers to assemble all of the towns, dungeons, and 
wilderness, fill all of the rooms with items like furniture or bones or 
whatever, and other neat little things that make the game fun. On top of 
that, we have to place all of the NPCs in the world, give them schedules, 
write usecode for doors, torches, and everything else that can be "used", 
place monsters and treasure, and all of that kind of stuff. That doesn't 
even take into consideration laying down all of the animals in the 
wilderness, and creating neat little random encounters that the player will 
enjoy running across every once in a while. Of course, we don't have to wait 
until the engine 100% complete before we start on this stuff, but you get an 
idea of how much is left to once all of the code, (except for bug fixes), is 
done.</EM>
<BR><BR>
<LI>Here's what Brian Martin had to say regarding Lord British's creative input into Ultima IX and the size of the game:
<BR><BR>
<EM>Well, Rich doesn't really sit up on high and hand down guide lines. All of 
the early design stuff is done by a small group of people with Rich present, 
and has final say on what does or does not get into the design. Once all of 
the early design work is done, we try to stick to that design as closely as 
possible. One of Rich's biggest jobs during heavy development time, (like 
right now), is to play the game as much as is possible with an eye towards 
keeping things in line with the early design concepts. He makes a lot of 
suggestions and critiques people's work both good and bad.
<BR><BR>
As for the sizes of the plot and the world, they're both big.</EM>
<BR><BR>
<LI>While we do not know the exact system requirements for Ultima IX, Brian Martin has indicated that people will definitely *not* need a P-133 or above to make the game fly.
<BR><BR>
<LI>Michael Dorn - the actor known for his role as Worf the Klingon in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine - will be the voice of The Guardian in Ultima IX. Kay Kuter will be the voice of Lord British, and Maurice LeMarche (aka The Brain from "Pinky and The Brain") will be the voice of  Shamino.
<BR><BR>
<LI>Here's the new (27 September 1996) update on Ultima IX's status from Brian Martin: <BR><BR>
<EM>The game engine is coming along very well. We designers are currently busy 
building cities and dungeons, and writing spells and other "usecode". Usecode is stuff like lighting torches, opening doors and chests, stuff like that. As for the spells, Bob White, one of the
designers on the team, is kicking serious butt. He's got the Avatar doing some really cool things. I just built one of the dungeons, and will be going back to fill it up with stuff before too long. The fleshing out of a dungeon or town is done in a series of passes as more art, monsters,
and stuff like that comes on line.
<BR><BR>
Of course, the programmers are busy coding all of the low level stuff, adding features to the game, and making sure that the frame rate stays high.
<BR><BR>
The voice acting has been finalized, and its great. Joye, the producer, Michael Morlan, one of the artists, and I flew out to LA for the voice recording, and it was very cool.</EM>
<BR><BR>
<LI>According to Lord British, Ultima IX will be <EM>four times</EM> as big a Ultima VII: The Black Gate.  <whew!>  Brian Martin clarified that LB was speaking in terms of landmass size, but added that Ultima IX would feature all the in-depth plot and characterization we've come to expect from an Ultima.
<BR><BR>
<LI>As of 14 August, the Ultima IX engine was still in pre-Alpha and playtesting has yet to begin.
<BR>
<LI>Instead of using character portraits as seen in Ultima VII and Serpent Isle during conversation, Ultima IX will feature animated texturemaps on NPC faces.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The method of disk swapping between the multiple CD-ROMs has been decided, but Origin does not want to comment.  However, Brian Martin did state that the swapping would not be narrative driven (like the Wing Commander games) because it would make the storyline too linear.
<BR><BR>
<LI>Will Ultima IX feature dynamic lightsourcing/shadowing?  Origin did not want to comment, but we all know what that means...
<BR><BR>
<LI>It will definitely take place in Britannia -- in fact, that's where The Avatar was at the end of Pagan.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The Guardian has taken over Britannia, and has been in power for a very long time.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Britannia has undergone serious physical changes under The Guardian's rule -- tectonics have changed, as has the environment. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>There will definitely be a party -- but we don't know how many.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The "traditional" Ultima companions will return in Ultima IX.  According to Lord British, Shamino is definitely in the game.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The game will ship on two or three CD-ROMs.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>This will definitely be the last Ultima to have The Avatar as the <EM>main</EM> character. <BR>
