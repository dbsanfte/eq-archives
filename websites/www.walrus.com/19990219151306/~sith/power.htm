     Before speaking about Ultima IX let me explain the idea behind the Ultima VII,
     VIII and IX trilogy. Its my first pre-planned trilogy, in contrast to parts IV, V
     and VI which only afterwards were fitting together. My idea was, "Wait. The
     series will run for a while. As long as I have interest for it and people buy these
     games, the series will continue. So why not plan another trilogy?" This newer
     trilogy deals with the Guardian. I created this character for exactly three parts,
     the concept was clear from the beginning. Ultima VII was the Black Gate, in a
     black box, Ultima VIII, Pagan, the red box and Ultima IX will have the subtitle
     "Ascension" and be shipped in a blue box. A sky, clouds, very light. It will have
     a strong ethical aspect again, like in Ultima IV and V, but in a very dark story,
     just as it should be in a game of this trilogy. The interaction with the outside
     world will be very detailed.

     How's that? Via NPC's or...

     I want to beat Ultima VII. Ultima VII in my eyes had the best world interaction.
     You could harvest grain, thresh it, grind wheat into flour, make dough from flour
     and water, bake the dough into bread and finally eat or sell the bread. Precisely
     this level of detail will now work for the whole world. Furthermore, the graphics
     are planned to be still better than in Ultima VIII. We won't use Jump'n'Run
     elements anymore. This probably was what players liked the least in
     Ultima VIII. The optical impression will be very fluent and give instant response
     to the players actions. The animations of the character, the monsters and the
     NPC's will be very detailed. The whole world will be very detailed. From the
     beginning the Ultima's had problems showing the outside world in certain
     aspects. Because of the camera being positioned orthogonal at 45 degrees north,
     you could not see the back side of walls. With the world becoming more and
     more threedimensional, this problem grew worse. A bomb could explode and
     move an important item behind a wall. For thise reason we had to write
     extremely complex code. And even then it happened from time to time, still. In
     Ultima IX there will be a whole new way of presentation, solving a lot of our old
     problems. Another big problem of the earlier Ultimas was with the scales. One
     for towns, one for the outside world and another one for the 3D dungeons. This
     meant for us that we had to write each code in three separate versions. We
     practically had to rewrite the game a few time anew, to do those perspectives
     justice. In the newer Ultimas we programmed everything in the same
     perspective. The whole world is shown in the scale of the towns, which was nice
     to some extent, but caused the player to cross the whole world to get from one
     point to another. It was like a outsized, detailed tapestry. Now we have a new
     scheme allowing a very good way to present the world and which solves all our
     former problems.

     At the moment tha game still is like large tapestry, but it can use multiple scales
     simultaneously. For conversations the camera can approach very closely, it can
     go back abit, like when going through a town, and even more when travelling
     with a ship or on a horse, or if you want to move quickly over the whole map.

     Will Ultima  have the perspective we are used to?
<BR><BR>
LB: 
<BR><BR>
     It will be still an isometric perspective, although we are playing with the idea to
     switch into first-person view from time to time. This is not a must, but
     theoretically we could do it. We will work on that in spring. The camera can
     freely move and turn, so the old problem with walls is gone. We believe that this
     new way of presentation gives the player a more interesting, more complete and
     kind of holographic image of the world we want to show.

     How are your plans for Ultima Underworld, now with Looking Glass working for
     Virgin?
<BR><BR>
LB:

     Interesting that you ask, these days Warren Spector, the producer of the
     Underworld series, is putting a team together at Origin, which is intended to
     work on that project. Underworld III is not officially planned, but we're collecting
     people.

     And Crusader II?
<BR><BR>
LB: 
<BR><BR>
     In the works. Before part II there will be a mission disk first. Our team has
     learned to keep the intervals between development, production and shipping. To
     be honest, this was a major reason for the problems with Ultima VIII. We had to
     ship it fast, simply for financial reasons. I hate to admit it, but its the sad truth.
     With Pacific Strike it was very similar. We should have continued to work on
     those games, although they were at least completely debugged. We found that
     we couldn't continue this way. The creative part suffered from it. And that's what
     bothers me most, because creativity is our strong side, that what we are here for.
     Crusader was the first game in the new Origin philosophy. Although the game
     could have been on the market three months earlier, we reworked it once again.
     We saw the potential in the game, but we realized that it was not really finished.
     Against all financial benefits we decided to keep it back until we were absolutely
     content with it. We won't make this old error anymore. We have learned
     something. Quality always has to have priority, even against financial reasons.

     When will Ultima IX be out?

     In Spring 1997, not earlier. This time it has to be perfect.
