<U>30 September 1997</U><BR><BR>

It was a fairly routine night on Ultima Online except for the backup problems Origin was experiencing on Atlantic, which is the server I play on.  There were two faulty backups this evening that caused me to lose about forty to sixty minutes of gameplay each.  No big loss, really, considering that it could have been much, much worse.<BR><BR>

On a sidebar, I must admit that I'm sort of getting tired of the very high level of complaining about Ultima Online that one sees in the newsgroups and on the chat rooms.  Sure there are backup problems, sure there are creature distribution problems, but this is technology that is less than one week since it went live -- I think it's necessary to give Origin a little time to hammer out the problems before jumping to conclusions.  After all, can you think of a game that has even come <EM>close</EM> to what Ultima Online is trying to achieve?<BR><BR>

So far, here are the rules I live by in the game:<BR><BR>

<LI>I want to reiterate the importance of trying to build up your bank account when you get into the game -- it will save you a lot of trouble later on.<BR><BR>

<LI>Always, always choose to play as a ghost rather than resurrect with penalties.  It will take longer to build your character back up to where you were when you died than it will to gather up a new set of equipment.<BR><BR>

<LI>Never bite off more than you can chew.  For instance, here I am a master archer feeling pretty full of himself and looking for a challenge.  In the past five minutes I've taken down two ettins, two trolls, and a pack of orcs and I do a quick tracking check and see that there's a lich nearby.  I go to find the lich, thinking it will be fun, and I'm dead within seconds of finding him.  Luckily I was able to get my stuff back after I went to a healer to be brought back to life, but I was adequately humbled by the experience.<BR><BR>

I apologize for the lack of updates, but I've been too busy playing the game.  Anyone that would begrudge me this obviously isn't an owner of the Charter Edition.  :-)<BR><BR>

It's really a blast to be able to build up one character without the threat of having him wiped in a day or so.  Sure, there have been problems with some of the backups, but I've never lost anything more than forty to sixty minutes of playing time.  My character is now an Adept Archer, and although some may complain that characters shouldn't advance so quickly (given the game hasn't even been live for a week), it's important to remember that it is absolutely necessary to risk life and limb to advance to the higher levels.<BR><BR>

For instance, I was heading back from the Skara Brae docks to Britain to give away some of the loot I had accumulated and was passing through what should have been an empty patch of forest when I ran headlong into an orc camp that just seemed to be undergoing construction.  There wasn't much there besides a few tables and chairs and many, many orcs.  After a pitched battles and many, many arrows, I took down four orc captains and seven orcs and sustained enough damage to have made me start worrying.  After I rounded up the loot and healed myself I remembered to look at my Archery skill, fully expecting to find myself a master or grandmaster, but to my shock I saw that I didn't raise my skill even one single point.  I quickly learned after that that if I wanted to enter the big leagues it's necessary to take on the big, big monsters.  So, if you see a master or grandmaster walking around it's important to keep in mind that they got there by suicidal assaults on ettins, trolls, and dragons -- monsters that will mop the floor with you if they get in a single good shot.<BR><BR>

There are a couple of things that have changed since the beta that will really, really make your life easier in Ultima Online:<BR><BR>

<LI>Put as much money as you can in the bank.  When your character dies, and you <U>will</U> die, being able to quickly re-equip yourself really is a big help.<BR><BR>

<LI>Buy a bedroll at a supply shop.  Unless you have a bedroll and use it to log out, when you log back in you risk having your character returned to where you were at the last world backup.  The only safe ways I know of to log out are through using a bedroll or renting a room in an inn -- and the bedroll is cheaper and easier.<BR><BR>

Guess what happy camper just got his grubby paws on the Charter Edition?  As soon as I'm done doing my happy dance and playing a bit I'll let you know how it is.<BR><BR>

I was taken back by the box, though, mainly because Origin didn't even try to make it the same size as the older Ultima boxes.  The Charter Edition box is roughly the same size as a board game box, and is about an inch thick.  Nifty goodies too, but I don't know how I'm going to get the box to fit on my Ultima shelf.
