<B>4.1 <U>Engine</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.1.1 <U>Will Ascension use the same engine as UVIII?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.   Holding with Origin tradition, each new Ultima  involves  new technology.  Every new numeral has  a totally new engine (U7SI is not considered a new numeral).  Ascension will feature a 3-D polygon-based engine with a movable point of view, or "camera", that will allow the player to customize the viewpoint in the game to his/her liking.<BR><BR>

<B>4.1.2 <U>What sort of perspective will Ascension use?</U></B><BR><BR>

Ascension will feature a movable point of view that will allow the player to customize the viewing position to their liking.  If the player wants to play Ascension as an isometric game, it just requires moving the camera to an overhead position.  If the player wants to play the game with a trailing point of view like Tomb Raider, it just requires moving the camera above and behind the Avatar.  Basically, any viewpoint seems possible with the Ascension engine.<BR><BR> 

<B>4.1.3 <U>Will objects still get lost behind walls in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

The  isometric perspective used in UVII  and UVIII had a problem of not  being  able  to see behind  walls  and  the items dropped behind  them.  Ascension  will  not have this problem as the movable camera will allow rotatable  perspectives.<BR><BR>

<B>4.1.4. <U>Will we be able to zoom the viewpoint in and out?</U></B><BR><BR>

In addition to having a rotatable point of view, the Ascension engine features the ability to zoom in and out in order to improve resolution.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/covezoo1.jpg"><IMG SRC="covezoo1.gif"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/covezoom.jpg"><IMG SRC="covezoom.gif"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<B>4.1.5 <U>Since the perspective in Ascension is so complex, will an object's size change with its distance from the Avatar?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  In the screenshots below, note the throne in the background, and how it appears when the Avatar is standing next to it.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/ng10.jpg"><IMG SRC="ng10.gif"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/ng6.jpg"><IMG SRC="ng6.gif"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<B>4.1.6 <U>Will there be an option to play the game from the first-person perspective?</U></b><br><br>

At this point it seems likely that there will be an option to position the camera in such a way as to allow a first-person perspective.  However, it isn't going to be the default view and the possibility exists that it might be removed from the game prior to shipping.<br><br>

<B>4.2 <U>World interaction</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.2.1 <U>How detailed is the physics model used in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Very detailed:<br><br>

<LI>Things fall at precisely 9.81 m/2^2<br><br>

<LI>Ascension does support moments of inertia in our physics system; objects do have a center of gravity, different from the geometric center. Objects have mass.<br><br>

<LI>Our physics system does support buoyancy. And, crates float lower if they're full. But it's not known if the design will incorporate this feature.<br><br>

<LI>Signs, hanging herbs, and other objects swing in the wind in our world; but surface-area forces aren't modeled.<br><br>

<LI>Our engine does not support having an axe stick in a door & letting the Avatar pull it out. And, not just any item can be picked up--only those that make sense to pick up.<br><br>

<B>4.3 <U>Movement and Transportation</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.3.1 <U>Will there still be jumping and climbing?</U></B><BR><BR>

One  important feature of Ultima VIII was the ability to jump and climb.   Unfortunately,  there  were  just  too  many  puzzles dependant on jumping skills.  U:A will include jumping and climbing, but it will <I>not</I> have the arcade action of Ultima VIII.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.2 <U>Will the Avatar be able to swim?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  The Avatar will be able to swim in Ascension, but only in shallows.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.3 <U>Will the Avatar be able to fly?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, but there will be a limit to how far up you can go.  You certainly won't be able to fly into the clouds, since they're a flat plane.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.4 <U>Will there be ships in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  There will be rafts, skiffs, and full-size galleons.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.4.1 <U>Will we be able to own a ship in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  In fact, here is a screenshot of one of the ships we'll be able to own.  You'll be able to roam and explore all three decks while you're sailing, too.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/u9-01.jpg"><IMG SRC="u9-01.gif"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<B>4.3.4.1.1 <U>Can we pilot it OURSELVES, and go WHERE we want, WHEN we want?</U></B><BR><BR>

By the end of Ascension, you should expect to be able to sail and explore anywhere... when you want, on a ship that you control.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.4.2 <U>Will there be combat involving ships?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  There can be ship-to-ship combat as well as monsters who board your ship.  Be careful when picking fights, though, because the ships can sink.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.4.2.1 <U>If there's going to be ship-to-ship combat in U:A, does that mean there will be pirates?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, there will be pirates.  They will be at sea, and very probably will have cannons.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.4.3 <U>Will we actually get to sail places, or is travel by boat a point-to-point means of transportation?</U></B><BR><BR>

It's actually going to be both, depending on the situation.  In normal circumstances you will sail from place to place, but when the story demands it you will not control the navigation.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.4.4 <U>Will there be storms and hurricanes at sea that can capsize or sink your ship?</U></B><BR><BR>

No storms, probably. The thing about ships is that they are designed to be a cool thing you get to let you go where you want and really fast. Although there *may* be terrible things at sea (large monsters/pirate ships/whirlpools/etc) the idea isn't about getting you out stranded on the water for hours. Part of this is because of the plot... Swimming is restricted out in the sea as a part of keeping the first eighth of the story linear in its progression.. at the end, when you can go anywhere and everywhere.. you'll want a quick way to do it. But in the beginning, if you can swim anywhere you want, then it destroys what we're trying to accomplish at the beginning of the game. The complex swimming physics probably won't be included.. however, we'll have a look at it and see if it helps game fun. Otherwise, it probably won't come into it.<BR><BR>

<B>4.3.5 <U>Is it possible to get lost in Britannia?</U></B><BR><BR>

It's quite easy in fact, or else the folks at Origin have really bad senses of direction.  A result of the player-controlled point of view is the fact that the viewpoint is no longer fixed, and that we won't be able to use the corners of the monitor as the points on a compass.  To combat this disorientation, Origin is including a pop-up compass and other navigational aids to make travel in Britannia less confusing.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4 <U>Combat</U></B><BR><BR>

Combat  in UVIII was an RPGer's nightmare, basically a session of frenzied  mouse clicking. Though  blocking and kicking actions were  implemented  they were rarely used.  It all came down to the weapon's power and the dexterity of the Avatar in avoiding getting knocked down.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.1 <U>What will combat be like in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Even though the final details of Ascension's combat system have still yet to be worked out, Lord British has indicated that it definitely leans more to strategic combat than the action-oriented combat seen in Pagan.<BR><BR>

Since aiming at an enemy is currently achieved by simply pressing the "A" button, the main focus of combat is the selection of the best position from which to attack as well as the most-effective weapon and tactic to use against the particular monster.<br><br>

As an example, Lord British indicated that using a slashing attack against a skeleton would be much more effective than using a stabbing attack because a stabbed blade would simply pass harmlessly through the creature's ribcage.<br><br>

<B>4.4.1.1 <U>What types of weapons can we expect to see in Ascension?  Will ranged weaponry be included?</U></B><BR><BR>

There will be lots of weapons, and they basically break down into 5 categories... 
Fisticuffs (okay, that's not a weapon class... but you get the idea..) 2. Single handed weapons (swords, scimitars, daggers, etc...) 3. Two handed weapons (two handed swords, battleaxes, war hammers, etc...) 4. Staves (used rather Japanese style... double ended.. pow pow, you know.) 5. Bows (archery)<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.1.2 <U>Will there be firearms in U:A? For example: muskets, cannons, powder kegs. If so, how many will there be?</U></B><BR><BR>

"Sort of". Details will be revealed at a later date<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.2 <U>Will there be two combat models, real-time and turn-based?</U></B><BR><BR>

Probably not.  At this point it seems as if the combat in Ascension will be real-time, with the ability to pause during combat.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.3 <U>Will combat combine the keyboard and mouse?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, and the whole interface layout is completely configurable by the user, including moving all of the mouse commands to the keyboard.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.4 <U>Will there be more monsters?</U></B><BR><BR>

Since each monster required hundreds of frames of animation, Ultima VIII only had a small selection due to space and budget constraints. Ascension will have feature a much greater variety since it will be released on CD-ROM and space is no longer a consideration.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.4.1 <U>Will there be monsters bigger than the Avatar, and will we have to look up at them?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes there will be gigantic monsters, and you will have to look up at them.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.4.2 <U>Are there are a set number of creatures in Britannia, and therefore a set number of battles, or is the population random?</U></B><BR><BR>

There are both. Many are a preset number, providing surprise encounters and things of that nature. But there are some "hordes" who spawn over and over to provide for that bloodthirsty nature in some of us.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.4.3 <U>If a character has just beaten a horde of skeletons, and then leaves the arena of battle, and then some time later returns to the area, will the horde magically reappear (as happened in U7), or will they stay dead?</U></B><BR><BR> 

Both types will exist.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.5 <U>Will damage be visible on monsters or the Avatar?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  The E3 demos have shown an early version of blood spurting out of wounds.  In addition, creatures shot will arrows will actually have the arrows continue to stick out of the wounds.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.5.1 <U>How is damage going to be represented? Hitpoints?</U></B><BR><BR>

There will be some valuation of hitpoints, but how that is shown remains to be seen. There will be some visual feedback about your health on the Avatar, but to what degree, we don't know yet. And yes, arrows and darts will stick to him.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.5.2 <U>What will happen when creatures, including beasts/monsters, NPCs, and the Avatar, die?</U></B><BR><BR>

There is no answer just yet.  There will be corpses. But what happens to them over time is still being implemented/designed. There are no current plans for an undertaker, but that doesn't rule one out as a possibility.<BR><BR>

<B>4.4.6 <U>Will there be resurrection for the Avatar?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.  When the Avatar is killed during gameplay he is definitively dead, and you'll have to reload a saved game.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5 <U>Graphics</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.5.1 <U>Characters</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.5.1.1 <U>Will there be an option for a female Avatar?</U></B><BR><BR>

The team would like to include a female avatar.  We feel its important at a number of levels, including both the support of actual female players as well as to support good role-playing in general.  Currently, time, technical difficulty, cost of development, and cost of media (COGS) make it impractical.  However, we continue to think about this issue.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.1.2 <U>Will there be character portraits?</U></B><BR><BR>

Ultimas VI and VII featured character  portraits  when conversing with others.  In SI  this  was taken  a  step  further  by using digitized  photos for many of  the portraits. This feature was sorely  missed  in  UVIII.   Portraits will not be implemented in the same manner as in the previous games.  In Ascension, the "camera" will zoom in on the conversations to such a degree  that near-portrait  detail will be achieved.<BR><BR>

Here is a screenshot of Jaana, showing off the NPC facial artwork:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/u9-5A.jpg"><IMG SRC="u9-5A.gif"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<B>4.5.1.2.1 <U>Will characters in Ascension show facial expressions and emotions?  Will the Avatar show emotions as well?</U></B><BR><BR>

There might be some facial expressions in the conversations, but we're not sure we can pull it off well.  The Avatar will still be rather stoic, but the other NPC's will be physically acting as much as possible.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.1.3 <U>Will there be live actors and movie cut scenes?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.  There  will <I>not</I> be any  live  actors or video footage in Ascension, but there will many  rendered cut scenes throughout the game.  These  cutscenes will  not  limit  the non-linearity  of  the  game. There will also be a method to review all the cutscenes you've been through.<BR><BR>

The cinematic information will be delivered in two forms: the rendered CG flics and in-game set-scenes that occur with the Avatar as an observer, similar to those seen in Crusader: No Remorse.<BR><BR>

The rendered cutscenes will play a pivotal role to the plot of Ascension.  The sendings are actually the dreams of Lord British, which are being given to him by The Guardian, and will give The Avatar insight into events that he would not otherwise be aware of.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2 <U>Britannia: Big sky country</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.1 <U>Will we be able to see Britannia's sky?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  We will be able to look up at the sky and see it, clouds, the sun, and stars (at night).<BR><BR>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/godzilla2.jpg"><IMG SRC="godzilla2.gif"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.2 <U>Will we see the return of night and day?</U></B><BR><BR>

This is a definite yes.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.2.1 <U>How long in real time is a Britannian day?</U></B><BR><BR>

Currently, about 6 hours of real time equals one Britannian 24 hour cycle.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.2.2 <U>If there will be night and day, does that mean the game will have shadows?</U></B><BR><BR>

Currently, nothing casts shadows... but it's a feature we'd like to add and everyone tells us to add, but we haven't figured out how to do it well.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.2.3 <U>If there's going to be nighttime in Britannia, will the Avatar have to sleep?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  Sleep will heal you, but it might also be involved in plot elements.  An important thing to consider here is that even though it's night in Britannia doesn't mean the world stops... there will be things to do at night.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.2.4 <U>If the Avatar's going to have to sleep, is he going to have to eat?</U></B><BR><BR>

Food will heal you. You will not have some food counter that clicks off with movement.. you will not starve to death.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.2.5 <U>If the Avatar has to eat, will he also have to go to the bathroom?</U></B><BR><BR> 

The Avatar never needs to go to the toilet because he's really a Marvel superhero, and his superpower is that instead of turning food into poop, it turns into health.<BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.3 <U>How about the seasons and weather?</U></B><BR><BR>

Oh, yes.  Here's what Bill Randolph, U:A's lead programmer, had to say on the issue of weather:<br><br>

<i>Currently, we have no plans for snow. However, we do support rain & fog to varying degrees. We actually have a storm that moves around the map. The closer you are to the storm center, the more dramatic the weather change. For instance, if you're on the fringe of the storm, you might get a light drizzle, and some diminished visibility. Closer to the storm, you'll get heavier rainfall, poor visibility, dark lighting, and lightning & thunder. The wind also changes with weather. Sunny days have a light breeze; stormy weather has a heavy wind that kicks up. The sky will smoothly transition from daylight to storm conditions. Currently the sky smoothly transitions from day to sunset to night & back again in the morning. And, because the weather is geographically located, when you pass through a moongate you'll get different weather at the other end.</i><BR><BR>

<B>4.5.2.4 <U>Will the skies be bitmaps or something 3D?</U></B><BR><BR>

The skies are bitmaps, displayed on a 3d dome shape.<BR><BR>

<B>4.6 <U>Inventory</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.6.1 <U>What type of inventory management will there be in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

The primary change from the previous Ultima systems is inspired by the fact that we've been unhappy with the way you start to generate piles of junk which are difficult to sort while playing. As an aid to organization, we're going to have things fall into 'slots' within the container which represent the maximum number of objects the container may hold. The containers determine the number of slots... big containers have more slots, little containers have fewer slots.<BR><BR>

Containers in Ultimas 6-7 had volume and weight restrictions, and while this was nice for the 'realism' in the game, the players found it obtuse and couldn't easily determine when a container would be full.  For instance, a backpack might only have one "heavy" object in it and it would be full.  Players couldn't easily 'see' if something was full or not.  With the slots, we hope to make that management much easier. <BR><BR>

Here's a screenshot showing, for the first time, Ascension's slotted inventory system:<br><br>

<center><A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/pack_bg.jpg"><IMG SRC="pack_bg.gif"></A></center><br><br>

<B>4.6.2 <U>Will we be able to wear different types of armor and clothing and see it reflected on the Avatar's person?  What type of 'paperdoll system' will Ascension use for equipping items on the Avatar?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, you will be able to wear different types of armor and have it reflect on the Avatar.  The current plan is the "paperdoll" avatar system where he faces the camera and you drag items on and off him.  However, that might change as the system is tested and refined.<BR><BR>

<B>4.6.3 <U>Will Ascension pause when I check my inventory?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  Origin finally realized that it's not fun getting creamed by an Orc when you're looking for that yellow potion that always hides behind a ham.  :-)<BR><BR>

<B>4.7 <U>Map</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.7.1 <U>Will it be a monoscale map like Ultima VII or dual-scaled map like Ultima IV?</U></B><BR><BR>

This is a difficult question to answer since there is no set camera angle or zoom level in Ascension.  However, it seems that Britannia will be presented to the player on a monoscale map.<BR><BR>

<B>4.7.2 <U>How big will Britannia be in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

In terms of map size, Ascension is about 50% smaller than U7, but about 5x bigger than U8. Lord British mentioned that he felt there was too much "dead" space in U7, and he wanted to eliminate that in U:A. Seth M. calls it "tighter."<BR><BR>

<B>4.7.3 <U>Is Britannia going to be round or flat?</U></B><BR><BR>

Round. The world will wrap from North to South and East to West as in previous Ultimas.<BR><BR>

<B>4.8 <U>Conversation and Speech</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.8.1 <U>Will Ascension still use the menu system for conversations?</U></B><BR><BR>

Ascension will continue to use the menu system for conversations, with real conversation responses to NPCs.  Conversation will be controlled by hot keys or mouse clicks.<BR><BR>

<B>4.8.2 <U>Will Ascension have full speech?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.<BR><BR>

<B>4.8.2.1 <U>With the full-speech, will 'ye-olde-english' style dialogue be used as in previous Ultimas? Furthermore, will the voice actors be using American accents or more 'British' ones?</U></B><BR><BR>

The language will be something of a hybrid.  There will be enough old English so that it sounds Britannian, but it will not be Shakespearean.  Vocalization of different "accents" has an implicit characterization.  For example, a noble may have a high English manner of speech, whereas a chimney sweep may have a more low-brow manner of speaking.<BR><BR>

<B>4.8.2.2 <U>There is some concern that with full speech and a rumored reduction in the volume of conversation from previous games that the depth of the story and character may be affected.  Any comments?</U></B><BR><BR>

You needn't fear any lack of depth in characters in U:A.  Compelling characters are incredibly important to the Ascension dev team, so much so that a screen writer will be hired to help make sure that not only is the dialogue concise, but that it also conveys the most effective storytelling possible given the medium. There is a great deal of effort being put into the story.<BR><BR>

<B>4.8.2.3 <U>Will text subtitles be available in addition to full speech? </U></B><BR><BR>

The plan is for you to be able to toggle text subtitles on or off, and speech on or off.<BR><BR>

<B>4.8.3 <U>Have the voice actors been cast?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  Michael Dorn, "Worf" from Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine, had originally been chosen to provide the voice for The Guardian, but has since been cut because his voice did not have the power or range necessary.  Bill Johnson, the voice actor who originated the voice of The Guardian, will return to the role in U:A.<BR><BR>

Additionally, Kay Kuter will play Lord British, and Maurice LeMarche, "The Brain" from Pinky and the Brain, will provide the voice of Shamino.  <BR><BR>

<B>4.8.4 <U>How long is the script for Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Origin isn't saying, but they have said that the Avatar alone has approximately 4,000 lines of spoken dialogue.<BR><BR>

<B>4.9 <U>Interface</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>4.9.1 <U>Will there be more shortkeys?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes,  there  will  be lots. There  will  be shortkeys for keys, spellbooks, stats and more.<BR><BR>

<B>4.9.2 <U>How about user configurable keys?</U></B><BR><BR>

The keyboard and mouse will be completely user-configurable. At this moment, no
commands will be excluded from this paradigm as far as Origin can now tell.<BR><BR>

<B>4.9.3 <U>How will text be handled in Ascension's 3D environment?</U></B><BR><BR>

The game will use a "hover" look code. What this means is that if the cursor hovers over an object for a period of time (approximately one or two seconds), a small box of text will appear giving the item's name (i.e. chair, door, candle, hoe of destruction, etc.) It is similar to how most Windows programs do to identify an icon on tool bars.<BR><BR>

Conversations will be presented on the screen in another color and not boxed (like the look code). The conversation's response strings (for the Avatar) will appear overlayed on the scene and they can be activated by clicking on the string or a hot key for the number of the response. Very seldom is there only two choices to a response.<BR><BR>

<B>4.9.4 <U>Will there be automatic notetaking in Ascension?</U></B><br><br>

Yes.<br><br>
