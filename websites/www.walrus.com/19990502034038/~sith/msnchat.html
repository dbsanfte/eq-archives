This is a log of a chat held on the Microsoft Network (MSN) on October 22, 1996. It has been edited 
slightly for readability. Many thanks to MSN and our hosts Jay, Todd, Roderick, and Mike.  This log was originally posted on the <A HREF="http://www.bestware.net/whisper/woo/" TARGET="_parent">Worlds of Origin</A> web site, and I have added it here because I've had trouble getting into their pages.
<BR><BR>
Host Todd_AsstFM: Welcome everyone to the Richard Garriott - Lord British Chat. Richard, if you
would, please give us a little bit of intro and then we'll start in with the questions. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: First, let me thank you all for being here... This is my first time on the Microsoft
Network and I'm please to see all the attendants... As some of you may know, I have two main
projects I am working on these days here at Origin... which I'd be happy to field questions on, as well
as any other Origin topic... My two main projects of course are Ultima Online and Ultima IX... Ultima
Online will be going beta in the next few months... and is a many thousands of simultaneous players
playing in a persistent Britannia... and Ultima IX is the closing chapter in the third trilogy of "mainline"
Ultimas... Thank you. Go ahead with the questions.
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: I am Rick Riley, a 22 year old game designer from Austin. Last year, I had a RP game
submission at Origin. Our project was turned down(rumors of budget restraints). Should I try to
re-submit our revised idea, or get on at Origin?
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Hmm... I'd have to do a little research first before I could respond accurately...
However, these days as a general rule I would recommend close association...with a major publisher if
you're going to undertake any project...
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Is Origin currently funding outside development now? or is mainly in house......
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Origin produces mostly in-house games and especially if you don't already have a
track record... it is much easier to work on the inside than build a new external developer. GA 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Thanks for you time.......I love your company and your games...I hope to be a game
desinger there someday :) 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: How much of a hand have you played in the writing/development of Ultima 9? ---Also,
thanks for taking the time to talk to us :)! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Ultima IX is in fact my main focus at Origin... so my involvement has been
substantial... in fact, Ultima Online has been managed and run primarily by Starr Long... with me
watching over his shoulder... Since Ultima IX is such an important milestone in the mainline Ultimas, I
felt it needed my full attention... which is notto say Ultima Online does not represent a significant
portion of the future of Ultimas... But the challenges facing Ultima IX seemed greater. GA 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: Great! So the main focus is still for this to be an 'Ultima Player's Ultima?' 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Absolutely! GA 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: How many new cities will there be in Ulitma Online? From alpha to beta that is 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: There are 12 original cities, and approximately 5 new never-in-Britannia-before
cities... 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: ok thank you M'lord 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: The alpha test had merely Britain. All 17ish will be in the beta test. GA 
<BR><BR>
DannaNoelle: So, what is your driving conceptual forcus for U9? What, in essence is your prime
investment in the project? By the way, when you were in New Hampshire, I used to live blocks from
your offices but did not know! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Well then neighbor for Ultima IX we had two main goals: One was to build a truly
epic conclusion to the trilogy of trilogies... in the sense of great story... and the other was to build
gameplay that matched or exceeded our goals and expectations in previous Ultimas... I'd characterize
the gameplay goals as a world better presented than the interaction of Ultima VII which I felt was the
best so far... and a story more compelling and well presented than in any of the games IV through VI...
And of course, while preserving some of the animation and detail we strived for in Ultima VIII we are
not building an arcade game rather a role-playing game. GA 
<BR><BR>
DannaNoelle: On a side note, what did you think of the U8 engine being picked up for Crusader? Did
you have a hand in that? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Yes, this was a great re-use of technology. The Crusader team is made up primarily
of Ultima veterans... So I did have a hand in its beginnings but it has now evolved into its own team
unit. GA 
<BR><BR>
king_quest: Will there be any new additions to the fighting sequences? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Oh yes... Combat has been one our major focuses in Ultima IX... We have created
a gameplay approach that we call "interventionist"... so that other party members can stop the progress
of combat to let you give them strategic commands... yet the game can be played from very nearly
turn-based to effectively real time without affecting strategy... 
<BR><BR>
king_quest: I really enjoyed the combat in ultima 8 because it leads combat to new possibilities! I
believe that Ultima has been an inspiration to all! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: merely adjust for player preferences... It's hard to describe but I think you'll be
pleased. GA 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Greetings, Richard. Do you have any plans as far as attending next year's conventions,
like E3, DragonCon and GenCon? BTW, I'm having a blast with No Regret and I *hate* shooter
games. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Greetings. I hope Adam Dupre is doing well... Yes, I plan to attend E3 and
DragonCon at least, GenCon most likely... Glad to hear you are enjoying No Regret. I too find the
new death sequences compelling. GA 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Adam Dupre is doing great, thanks. :) If you come to GenCon and can fit it in your
schedule, are you interested in another bbq? Especially if the weather is warmer and you can swim? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: If I come to GenCon which is likely another BBQ would be great with or without
the weather. GA 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: What do you think about the support you got for Ultima Online from the Internet community?
(As a side note, i'm realying this chat to #Ultima on efnet IRC where we have 40 people dieing to talk
with you (cough cough hint hint)) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Well... We have been extremely pleased with the staggering support we have seen
so far... To be specific, I love to throw around data such as... TEN after 6 months of free beta test
went live with 25,000 players... Ultima Online, which has not gone beta yet at all has 32,000 paying
beta testers... So I think it is safe to say we have a strong level of interest in the internet community.
GA 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: That's a good ACE to have! Side note: Will there be llama's in Ultima Online? What about
Fritos? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Well, though I don't understand it myself, indeed there are llamas in Ultima Online...
Sincerely, I have yet to understand the deep meaning of llamas, but to my knowledge... the Fritos are
as of this time absent. GA 
<BR><BR>
Elliot_Mann: Okay, Richard, I have a few questions. 1: Who is the major enemy in UO? 2: Can your
character be killed in UO? 3: What new monsters will be in UO beta? And 4: What do you think of
the Fheads? (and what really happened at DragonCon?) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: 1: The major opponents are Lord British and Blackthorn...though neither of these
people are truly in the right... which you'll need to play to understand better... 2: I dare you try to find
out... 3: Many, about twice as many as in most Ultimas... I have mixed feelings because on the one
hand, I'd love to go incognito... and help them storm the castle to see if it could be done and in fact will
likely join them in this effort... but I hear rumors of their malicious intent in other anti-social ways which
I may not support as much. GA 
<BR><BR>
Elliot_Mann: Rev. Brucifer says hello 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Greetings Rev. GA 
<BR><BR>
jazzz: Greetings Lord British from #ultima on IRC. Auric extends a special greeting to you since he
cannot join us here. My question concerns the overwelming response to Ultima Online and Guilds that
have formed? What is your opinion of said guilds? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: I think the guilds will help make Ultima Online a great success... and in fact I believe
I will owe a great debt to many of them... in particular groups like the Bards Guild who plan to follow
adventuring parties and spin tales... Theives guilds that plan on honing the craft and brotherhood... And
those who intend to publish written works within the game excite me a great deal... but that is only the
tip. There are many guilds that I am very excited by. GA 
<BR><BR>
jazzz: The Ravens of Fate and Sleepless Knights send a hearty "Hello" as well...Thanks for making
such an enticing game and we await you online... 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thank you. Hope to see you soon. GA 
<BR><BR>
Avatar01: Hi Lord British. What are the job requirements at Origin? Like for a programmer 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Well, that depends... For programmers... we work mainly in C++ or Assembly...
Windows 95 native and Microsoft C++ compiler... The very best way to get in as a programmer is to
send a demo along with a resume... where the demo shows that you have general or specialty skills
that are strong. GA 
<BR><BR>
Avatar01: Will the armagedon spell be present in UO? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Interesting question... To my knowledge there is not currently a plan for the
armagedon spell to be present... but when it comes time for the world to end, I'm sure Lord British will
have it at his disposal. GA 
<BR><BR>
Sularas: In the creation of the UO storyline are your designers taking into account all of the chaotic
things that humans can do? And how much will Origin employees be involved in playing NPC parts in
the story? (BTW I will wait longer for a better UO) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Yes, we are trying to take as much of this into account as we can... We hope to
learn much during the beta test... For example during the alpha test, we discovered people like to run
around naked... and people like to try to kill Lord British, so guards will be programmed to discourage
this behavior... Starr Long will play the part of Blackthorn while I will play the part of Lord British and
these two characters... will only be in the game when one of us is online. Additionally, there will be
other Origin people... playing as game masters and key characters periodically. GA 
<BR><BR>
Sularas: The League of Pirates raises a tankard of ale in your honor today! ......and masses for
tomorrow....Muwhahahaha from Drasnia 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: And I drink one with you 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: I love the books, maps and "trinkets" thatcome with Ultimas. Anything special planned for
U9? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thank you. I'm fond of the detailed materials as well... It's always a battle when it
comes to the cost of these items... but I assure you I am devoted to keeping them in the game... We of
course already know how the cloth map and fiction manuals will likely be... but have not yet decided
upon a trinket. GA 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: What is this obsession some people have with killing LB? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: I think it cam from... in the earliest Ultimas, I noticed people did it so I strove to
make LB immortal... Yet, in Ultima III through VII we've left a loophole unitentionally... so the mythos
of killing Lord British grew over time and now many try to see if we have trapped all possible ways to
do it. GA 
<BR><BR>
j_w_young: Impersonation has been a big problem in the WWW chat rooms. Will UO have a way of
handling impersonators, or are we on our own here? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Yes we are aware of this problem... and we are now doing some things to stop it
such capturing people's IP addresses to prevent this... but we will continue to strive to minimize the
problem. I too have been impersonated so I have a deep understanding and resistance to the issue.
GA 
<BR><BR>
j_w_young: Will the old Ultimas be updated and re-issued (like "Wing Commander: The Kilrathi
Saga")? Thanks for your time. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Yes. The question is when. I expect post Ultima IX we will do either all I through IX
or I may go back to Ultima IV in particular and do a modern technology complete rewrite. GA 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: In a recent PC Gamer interview you said that in Origin's future there would be some
form/combination of an Ultima 10, Underworld 3, and Ultima On-Line 2. Has there since been any
consensus on which of these will be done or which two will be combined? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Sort of... But it's hard to describe... The titles will likely be Ultima Online II and
whether the next one is... called Ultima X or Underworld III depends on some fictional factors and
whether this game is online. GA 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: Done... I would love to see a rewrite of both Ultimas 4 and 5. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thanks. Me too. GA 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: I was told by Jeff Johan., who worked Savage Empire, that Origin is building it's own sound
stage. Is this true? And how will U8 and U9 differ the most? BTW, I really miss your haunted
houses!!!! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: I still intend to do haunted houses... and I am building Britania Manor Mark III... I
mean my third home, a new larger more real castle in which to host the next haunted houses... Origin
has secured land upon which we can build a new soundstage, but no plan is active to build it right
now... The biggest difference between U8 and U9 is the fact that U9 is in 3D, third person not pov...
The second biggest delta is gameplay and scope. GA 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Is Ultima 9 going to be it for the avatar? (Haunted House this year--Cool!!!) I have really
enjoyed speaking with you! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Haunted House is not this year but in the future. The avatar will continue but not
likely as the main character in the future. GA 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: How much will the commercial version of Ulitma Online cost, the client price and monthly
rate. Flat rate for unlimited usage or hourly? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Well, the answers I'm about the give are preliminary and suject to frequent change,
but... we plan to sell the game like a normal top of the line retail product... which means it should be
available in the stores for $40-$60... then for online time, we plan to charge as little as we can to keep
the game running... so somewhere between $10 and $30 per month flat rate with some free time with
the original purchase... GA 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: The Forsaken sends there regards, long live LB (http://users.visi.net/~auric/ieindex.html
wants you to visit) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thank you. GA 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: I know you've been to the Worlds of Origin website. What do you think of it? BTW,
don't forget you promised to will your house (we'll take the current one) to Adam Dupre. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Fear not, I have not forgotten... and yes I've been to the web site a few times and
find it amazingly complete and fun. GA 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Any chance you can help us get "official" fan club status? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: PS, thanks for the cookies 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: YOu're welcome :) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: I would like to see you achieve official status... if you keep pestering Richard and
others he might recommend here at Origin I think that's your best bet. GA 
<BR><BR>
Elliot_Mann: Will you be able to name pets in UO? How about have multiple pets? What kinds,
besides cats and dogs? (Question from the Fheads: "What's Warren Spector up to? He rules!") 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: You will be able to have multiple pets... I suspect there will be more than just cats
and dogs but I'd hate to go on record as to what... since they are still being created... I have not heard
of plans to allow you to name them, but I will mention it to the team... Warren Spector is up to no
good... just kidding... he's having a good time with the Looking Glass folks and he and Doug Church
are trying to get a new POV project together. GA 
<BR><BR>
Elliot_Mann: The Hemp Society says, "Hello!" http://members.tripod.com/~sbp/hempsoc.html, Thank
you for your time, Richard. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thanks. I'll check out your site. GA 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: I understand there's going to be portraits in U9, as was in Serpent Isle. In SI it looked like you
used real people as models. Will you do this in U9, and where will your talent come from? BTW, I
have a pretty good mug! I'm a 'dead' ringer for Dupre! ;) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: In fact in Ultima IX the camera just moves in closer to the 3D figures while they talk
to each other... so it's not portraits per se... it's what they look like on their real face. GA 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: Lot's of plans for easter eggs and secret places in UOL and U9? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Yes, of course. We will spend lots of time on this. GA 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Death and Ultima Online. Care to eloborate? (I bring this up because the recent death of
Westwoods lead Red-Alert programmer puts me in a dreary mode. BTW- Ever consider cutting the
brake lines on one of your programmers automobiles to buy a project time? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Hmm... I was not aware that Westwood had a death in their development team. If
true this is grievous news... In Ultima Online, death and loss of connection are important problems we
are designing around... In the case of death, a dead character gets to play as a ghost with abilities and
restrictions... Abilities include being able to move through many normally impassable objects... and
restrictions include not being able to speak with the living unless they have cast a seance spell... so
many parties may wish to keep a ghost with them.. On the subject of the loss of connection, we don't
want people attacking other players and them logging off... so you can only leave the game safely at
your home or an inn or at camp... If you log out during combat your character will stay online for a few
minutes fighting on its own allowing others retribution...GA 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Thanks for not dodging that one! Sounds COOL! Work on the Fritos... in UO. (please)
Thanks for your time and I love the OWO site! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thanks. GA 
<BR><BR>
Grundig: This has probably already been asked but I loved the whole Wing Commander series and
just finished Wing Commander 4, any plans for future episodes? No follow-up. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Yes, of course. Not only is Wing V well along but... you can already create missions
in a cool new engine... but you may have also seen the recently release Wing Commander cartoon
series... and we have two more Wing Commander games in dev now. GA 
<BR><BR>
Sularas: Will we be able to board and seize ships in UO and what type of sea combat will there be? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Yes. Ships are one of my favorite parts... There are large multi-player ships where
people are needed at multiple stations at the same time... One can raise the anchor. Others can unfurl
the sails. Stil others can navigate and steer. .. I think that these ships will give huge multiplayer gaming
fun... In addition there will be pirates and sea monsters and individual sea travel in skiffs and perhaps
even sea creatures. GA 
<BR><BR>
Sularas: What kind of weapons will we have aboard.? Sail the seas and plunder with the League of
Pirates. Become a member or read about our drunken adventures at http://www.silcom.com/~badger/
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Well of course the ship will have cannons... but in additional all onboard can use
whatever they bring with them. GA 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: Do you know how Chris Roberts is fairing now that he's left origin. What are his future
plans (any involvement in Wing Commander)? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: If there is a Wing Commander movie he would like to be involved... Chris has
started a new company called Digital Anvil... He hopes to raise enough money to make not just
games... but specifically movies as well... Since he has such a strong interest in movies, he needed to
try this on the outside... If he swings movie deals, we still hope to work with him on the game versions
of these properties. GA 
<BR><BR>
Lazarius: Yes ,that obsession with the overthrowing of Lord British is quite unwarranted. It likely to
cause a great deal of strife in UO. There seem to be two factions those for and against. What effect
will this have on the world of UO? Sosaria revisited? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Actually, I'm looking forward to see both sides in action. Of course, I intend to be
well defended and have the capability to cause instant death. So... I don't fear much yet in previous
Ultimas I thought I was quite safe and often have found wrong... Either way, I'm just looking forward
to being online and playing with all of you. GA 
<BR><BR>
Lazarius: A big thanks and hello from the Ultima Dragons also, keeps up the GREAT work you guys
do an excellent job :) Thank you for your time. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thank you all very much. 
<BR><BR>
Host Todd_AsstFM: Do you have any last thoughtful words you would like to share with us?? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thank you all for your great support of the Ultima series... Ultima has now gone on
since 1979, which is approaching 20 years... and so it has roots that go to the very beginning of
computer gaming... and I truly hope to sustain your interest far into the future with the Ultima series.
Thanks. 
<BR><BR>
Host Todd_AsstFM: Well my Lord, it has been a pleasure. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: For me as well. 
<BR><BR>
Host Todd_AsstFM: Richard, we will be going informal at this time and you are more than welcome
to stay and chat with us. Again, thank you everyone. 
<BR><BR>
Host Jay_MSN: Thanks, Richard. :) And thanks to Richard Steinberg and David Swofford, as well. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: I can stay for a few minutes and thanks 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Lord British Raucks! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thanks 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: Thank you for having female Avatars! 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: 
<BR><BR>
Lazarius: Thank you 
<BR><BR>
Sularas: Long live LoP! League of Pirates shall sail soon! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: You're welcome 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Looking forward to the League of Pirates 
<BR><BR>
Elliot_Mann: What about the Hemp Society? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: I'll have to see your web site first. You make rope, right? 
<BR><BR>
Elliot_Mann: And, have you ever seen Misery? That's Lady Whisper. 
<BR><BR>
Elliot_Mann: No 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: hahah 
<BR><BR>
Darrin_S: With the current state of the Console video game industry, do you see this Xmas as a 'PC'
Xmas? If so, how do you think the upcomming year will look for the PC market? 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Mr. Garriott, what do you think of the new powerful N64 by Nintendo? 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Elliot: you make a lot of enemies at OSI with your stupid fat and obessive jokes. 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Hey., Elliot: You have a problem with LW???? Are are you just anti-social? 
<BR><BR>
Elliot_Mann: I represent the Fuckheads. That's all. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: I think PSX and N64 are the two only real players on the consoles, but I still feel the
best games will be PC. 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: Everyone from andrews chat room (all 20 or so of us) say hi, and thank the gods that its
FLAT RATE, and hourly rate would make us all end up with HUGE bills 
<BR><BR>
cormiac: How long will beta UO last? 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: good question! 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: LB: It looks like a 3D accelerator will be necessary for U9. No? 
<BR><BR>
Sularas: LoP LoP LoP LoP LoP LoP LoP LoP LoP 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Thanks to Andrews Chat Room. Glad to oblige. We do not intend to gouge anyone.
<BR><BR>
Cheech: 50 of us on IRC right now. Lets go for a IRC.origin.ea.com chat session some time! We can
make it work! 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: I have to agree...The PC is still the best. I have followed your company since Ultima 3....I
have played almost every origin game and think they are all great. I still want to work at Origin some
day. I feel you guys are going in the right direction! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Uo beta will last an unknown period of time 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: U9 will not require 3D accelerators 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: even a rough estimate 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: would be apreciated on the length 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: of beta 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: Whoever had the idea of a rotating camera for U9 should be given a giant fat raise :). I'm
really looking forward to seeing the backs of buildings :)! 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: BEta till the bugs die... 
<BR><BR>
DannaNoelle: thank you m'lord. It's been a pleasure! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Rotating camera rules. And each screen shot is better than any previous
Ultima--something I feared would not be true 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: RG: will Dupre be back for U9 somehow? 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Can you unchain MrHades and allow him to come back to #Ultima. Please.... 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Beta may last til ship 
<BR><BR>
jazzz: Great 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: Mr. Garriott - I heard u have a sword collection. Correct? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Correct. 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Mr. Garriott - when do you think Ultima 9 will ship? 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: How extensive is it and do you have things from all over the world? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Whisper: Dupre does get a cameo 
<BR><BR>
cormiac: as a ghost? 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Thanks. :) Please say hello to Greg and Jay Gould for me. :) 
<BR><BR>
cormiac: u gonna have any spam in UO RIchard_Garriott: OPEN2UANDO: The collection is only a
dozen or so swords, but extend into other things like crossbows, guns, and cannons. 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Garriott: Why where you hiring UO programmers so recently? Hit a road block? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: LadyWhisper: I will 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: Wow! That's fasinating! Thanks... 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Comiac: No spam, well maybe 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: LB : I hope U9 is super hard! I want to take years finishing it!!!!!!!!! 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: LOL, Elmore! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Cheech: Not a roadblock, but still needed 
<BR><BR>
cormiac: U mean ultima games have endings? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Elmore: U9 is big 
<BR><BR>
cormiac: :) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: :) 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: Ive dragged out UW 1 and 2 as far as I can take it! 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: No more FPP games please, they make me have seizures. :) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: FPP? 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: first person perspective 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: NO! I love first person!!! 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: LB: What Ultima is your personal fav? 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: It's the only real way to go! 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: They make me physically ill. I can't play Daggerfall. :( 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Garriott: The OWO website is GREAT. Thank the team for it! Please... update that FAQ as
often as possible! We live by it! 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: But that's why I like it :) 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Mr. Garriott, I have been working on various games with a small team of people from many
of your old ultima teams....Do you feel going through a investor is wise, then going to a publisher like
Origin for distrubtion? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Elmore: U4 high concept, U5 grayness in good and evil in story, U7 detail of world
interaction, U8 visuals, U9 beats all of these on each of those fronts with the possible exception from
the norm U4 was. 
<BR><BR>
Sularas: Garriot: All the brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity say your a cool guy. Compliments of
Dixie Dragon 
<BR><BR>
cormiac: I absolutely loved ultima 4! 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: I knew everybody loves U4! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Rick: No, I'd work with a publisher as early as possible. 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: I failed 4th grade because of U5. I hope I can keep my job when U9 comes out.... 
<BR><BR>
Host Jay_MSN: :) 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: LOL, Cheech! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Whisper: Many here play Daggerfall, but I just can't get into random dungeons. 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Mr. Garriott: So, who at Origin would you suggest I speak with? 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: Mr Garriot, have heard about the new Computer Gaming World. They just rated the top
150 games of all time... Your Ultima 4 came in 2nd... I think it got jipped... It was way better than
Civilization 1. :) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Cheech: Give us a call if you need a job. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: outofbalance: Thank you. 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: RG: I noticed a WarCraft II Box on your desk in the German magazine .avi and
cracked up. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Rick: Norma Vargas 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Sorry. I'm a NT man. Maybe if you design UO on NT's.... 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Whisper: Actually I prefer C&C but I prefer Warcraft II 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Cheech: We use a lot of NT here 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Hmm, that made no sense. 
<BR><BR>
Host Todd_AsstFM: Richard: Besides UO, are there any other betas that we can apply for?? 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: C&C iis great. I think the UO team gets alot of pratice on it too... (grin) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Whisper: Prefer C&C play Warcraft now 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Mr. Garriot: Someone told me that working at Origin is sometimes better to get your own
idea pushed though....is this true? (And are Midian still involved with Origin today....They are cool
guys) 
<BR><BR>
Lazarius: I am voting fer Warcraft III 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Todd: Not at this time 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: ahh. :) I'm blasting everything in No Regret in God Mode since I finished it already. 
<BR><BR>
Host Todd_AsstFM: Richard: Had to try. Is there an email address to be put on a list for the future?? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Rick: Yeah, working from the inside is easier. And the Midian folks are still good
friends, but we rarely work with them 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: whisper: that's a quote! 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: Is there anything in the works at Origins that's totally new and different? 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Cheech: what is? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Todd: If you're on the UO list, these will be the first people we contact with any
future opportunities. 
<BR><BR>
Host Todd_AsstFM: Richard: Ok. Thanks. :) 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: whisper: you 'blasting' things away... 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: OPEN2UANDO: Technosaur 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: ??!! 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Mr Garriott: Yeah, I have been in contact with Jeff John from Savage Empire, Lisa Smith
from Crusader, and Midian.....Also Arron Austin from Savage also.....All very cool guys. 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: heheh. I despise shooter games but am having a great time with No Regret 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: I hear the designers on Technosaur are *HOT* 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: (course.. that came from a UO programmer... so who knows) 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: Quick summary, please? 
<BR><BR>
Lazarius: Richard: Does an official Ultima fan club exist? or are we Ultima Dragons it? 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Cheech: Sounds like you know some of them personally 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Mr. Garriott: Oh, and not to leave out the Fat Man.....Very Cool Guy 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Lazarius: The Dragons are it 
<BR><BR>
Bugdog: Garriott: strange off topic question, but my hs physics teacher said incredible things about
your house. Do you really have an observatory? (for almost 7 years I've been wondering) 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: RG: There are very few games for the younger crowd that are any good. Any chance
you'll ever do something for Adam Dupre in a few years? 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: Richard One last question how much wil buildings cost in UO? (in UO currency) 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: whisper: Regret is great, it's amazing how they came up with all those different types of
weapons. 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: He's already playing Ultima. 
<BR><BR>
Lazarius: Richard: perhaps a 10% UO discount fer dragons (lol) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: BugDog: Yes and secret passage ways and waterfalls and tunnels and more 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: ohhhhh whisper.. you and non-violence.. heh 
<BR><BR>
Host Jay_MSN: my kind of house. :) 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Elmore: I usually stick to the machine gun and the grenade launcher. That takes care of
pretty much everything. 
<BR><BR>
OPEN2UANDU: Me, too! 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Whisper: No 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Dr_Redus: Don't know 
<BR><BR>
Bugdog: Garriott: When I win the lotto, will you give me the name of your architect? :) 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: I don't suppose I could pull a Kato Kaelin and crash at your place for a couple years :). 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: ok 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: Whisper: If there's an energy station, I go nuts with the UV gun! 
<BR><BR>
rick_riley: Mr. Garriott: Why did you stop with Worlds of Ultima-Martains Dream........I thought that
was a cool series 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: I'll fly out to austin to make Brit Manor III haunted house... 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: outofbalance: Six months ago, someone broke in while I was there and I had to
shoot at them and they went to jail for real. Don't do it. 
<BR><BR>
jazzz: You can hang with me Cheech 
<BR><BR>
outofbalance: :) 
<BR><BR>
Bugdog: GOOD FOR YOU! 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: jaz: heh

<BR><BR>
Dredlock: WTG, RG 
<BR><BR>
Sularas: Richard: We have a great ship ready for LB. Maybe we can go raid a town together :) 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: BugDog: The story is fun to tell now, but at the time it was quite scary 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: Was heather that one on Buccanear Den??? 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: (runs for cover...) 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: RG: Does she have an email address? I'd like to write her and tell her to make you
break a sweat. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Sularus: Looking forward to being a shipmate 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: LB: Several years ago, before I even knew about Ultima, I read about you in Newsweek and
how you love your haunted houses. At the time I thought; what a "strange" guy. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Whisper: She does not yet have an email address, but if you email me, I will hand it
to her. 
<BR><BR>
Dr_Redus: Are there going to be any rules that would cause a beta tester to be kicked out? 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Okay, will do. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Elmore: Well I am kind of a strange guy 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: ROFL 
<BR><BR>
Host Jay_MSN: :) 
<BR><BR>
Cheech: There is another quote 
<BR><BR>
Host Todd_AsstFM: Cool pictures in PC Gamer tho.

Richard_Garriott: Dr_Redus: None we have published but I'm sure one could manage it if they tried 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: I think #ultima is getting a lot of qooc's tonight. 
<BR><BR>
Richard_Garriott: Todd: Thanks 
<BR><BR>
Elmore: It's been great. Time to hit the hay; I live in the eastern time zone. 
<BR><BR>
LadyWhisper: Goodnight Elmore
