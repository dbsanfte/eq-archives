After finishing Jedi Knight as both a Light and Dark Jedi, and blowing through the Quake 2 demo, I was able to get back to Ultima Online in force.  As a quick aside -- if you haven't had a chance to see the 3DFX version of Quake 2 try to do so because it's a sight to see.<BR><BR>

For the first couple of days I played my Archer character trying to build up my bank account.  However, once I had made tens of thousands of gold pieces I began to realize that I was getting bored.  There were very few monsters that I couldn't kill with ease, very few places I haven't been, and I began to feel that I had exhausted Ultima Online. Even buying a house or tower seemed pointless because it would disappear in a number of days.  I decided to "retire" my Archer character and started a new Warrior character.  However, after a couple of days playing this new character it became clear that this new character would eventually fall into the same trap as my Archer. I decided to take a radical departure from my previous characters and started a Thief.<BR><BR>

I can say without reservation that being a thief is probably the most fun character I have played in Ultima Online.  After awhile, killing trolls, ettins, dragons, liches, etc., becomes rote and run-of-the-mill, but the constant interaction a thief has with other players really takes Ultima Online to a much greater level.  Over the lifetime of my character I have never had to leave the confines of Britain, and have really been amazed by the kind of "society" that is  beginning to form in the city.  There are many characters, like me, who never leave the city and spend their time online buying and selling things.  Others rant and preach their online beliefs, and others still are just newbies that have yet to realize that there's a much larger world outside of the city.<BR><BR>

All in all, I would definitely have to say that the key to Ultima Online having a long shelf life is for the players to not be afraid of stepping outside of their normal roleplaying worldviews.  Once you step outside of the kinds of characters you play (even if you play them anonymously as I do) Ultima Online can really open itself up.<BR><BR>

Damn LucasArts.  Damn you to hell.  As much as I love Ultima Online, I have to admit that I haven't really had the chance to play it since I got a hold of Jedi Knight.  There is nothing, *nothing* cooler than running into a room full of Stormtroopers, cutting them down with your lightsaber, and then watch as the last one draws his blaster and you pull it from his hand with the Force.  yoink.  Then they run around like a chicken with their heads cut off trying to figure out what to do next.  It's just too much fun.<BR><BR>

I have had a little bit of a chance to play UO though, and have been slowly chugging along at building up enough money to buy a house.  At first I wanted to buy a house, then I found a architect that would sell me a deed to a tower, so now I have my heart set on that.  It's a hell of a lot of gold, so it will take a long time.  All in all, though, it's really nice to see that the game seems to have slowed down into a nice, leisurely pace that allows people to actually concentrate on their characters without having to constantly worry about wipes or other, predatory characters.<BR><BR>

I'm still in the Trinsic area, and I'm actually beginning to enjoy it down there.  There doesn't seem to be anywhere near the level of player traffic you find in Minoc, Vesper or Britain, but the woods around the town are deathly still.  Since I'm not hunting monsters at the moment it's not a problem for me, but for newbie characters it certainly would make life difficult.<BR><BR>

A combination of home renovation, illness, and both mine and my wife's birthdays have kept me from playing as much as I would have liked to.  That and, of course, Jedi Knight.  wOOp.  LucasArts really has done a fantastic, fantasic job with JK.  I can't say enough in praise of JK -- it really is *that* good.<BR><BR>

My main UO character is still alive, and going strong.  I was a grandmaster archer for some time, then decided to jazz my look up a bit with some plate armor, which caused my dexterity to drop and I lost my grandmaster status.  Oh well -- there's no real difference between 99% and 100% archery skill.  I was a monster smasher for awhile, then moved onto being a self-proclaimed defender of newbie characters before deciding to try and enter the landed gentry class.  Right now I'm busying myself with trying to amass as much gold as possible to buy my very own stone tower.<BR><BR>

In many ways, trying to make money is every bit as challenging as fighting monsters is at the lower levels.  (Once you hit Master or Grandmaster archer, most things die before you have a chance to pull up their health bars.)  Through monster hunting, selling resources, and making goods to sell in towns I have been able to accrue a couple thousand gold in three days -- a far cry from the 110,000 gold I'll need for my tower.<BR><BR>

I've moved my main base of operations from the Yew/Skara Brae environs south to Trinsic.  I never spent much time in Trinsic before, and I have to say it's kind of charming.  I really do enjoy the "look" of Trinsic a lot more than the generic medieval look of most of the rest of Britannia or the rustic look of Yew.  Trinsic offers the services I need in a compact area, and offers easy and close access to forests, monsters and resources.<BR><BR>
