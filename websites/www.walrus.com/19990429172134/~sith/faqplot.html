<BR><BR>
<B>3.1 <U>Why is it called Ultima: Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

There  is  no  official explanation  from  Origin  as it would probably give away the plot. However, the general concensus is that The Avatar will "ascend" to being a fully-realized Titan of Ether in order to defeat The Guardian.<BR><BR>

<B>3.2 <U>General plot features of Ascension</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>3.2.1 <U>How much of the plot has been worked out?</U></B><BR><BR>

At this point in the development of Ascension the main plot has been fully scripted.  Voice acting for the cutscenes has already been recorded, but it is likely that Origin is still working out the side quests and the easter eggs.<BR><BR>

Likewise, Origin has already done much of the town and dungeon design and is currently stocking them with items, people and monsters.
<BR><BR>

<B>3.2.2 <U>What's the story about?</U></B><BR><BR>

Ascension is the final chapter in what has been coined the  'trilogy of trilogies' and will continue  the  story  from Ultima VIII  and  wrap  up the Guardian saga (UVII-A).<BR><BR>

The  game designers have also revealed  that they intend to resolve everything  about Ultima; right from  the beginning of the series.  Many artifacts and locations from past Ultimas will be brought back in Ultima: Ascension.<BR><BR>

Specifically, Origin has revealed that the plot centers around eight giant pillars that the Guardian has created and that are slowly destroying Britannia.<BR><BR>

<B>3.2.3 <U>Philosophical elements</U></B><BR><BR>

Starting from Ultima IV, the series has always had a plot based around  a  system of ethics. The  concept of The Avatar and the Britannian Virtues will play a key and central role in the game.<BR><BR>

<B>3.2.3.1 <U>Lord British indicated that the main focus of U:A would be the Avatar having to "regain" his virtues.  Is this still what the plot will involve?</U></B><BR><BR>

Sort of yes... the plot is very much in the vein of Ultimas 4-7, but we're not prepared to share the exact details of that.<BR><BR>

<B>3.2.3.2 <U>Will Ultima: Ascension keep track of good and evil deeds?  If so, will they affect the way NPCs interact with the Avatar?</U></B><BR><BR>

The game will be keeping track of the good and evil deeds and it will affect the way the game treats you.<BR><BR>

<B>3.2.4 <U>Plot Non-Linearity</U></B><BR><BR>

Similar to Ultima VII, Lord British has indicated that approximately the first eighth of the game will be a linear tutorial in order to acquaint the player with the game and controls, and then the plot will open to become non-linear.<BR><BR>

The beginning tutorial takes place in the ruins of Stonegate, the Shadowlord's castle, and has the Avatar first meeting Captain Hawkwind.<br><br>

<B>3.2.5 <U>Sideplots</U></B><BR><BR>

We  have been promised that there  will be plenty of sideplots (minor  quests  unrelated to the  major storyline) and lots of easter eggs.<BR><BR>

<B>3.3 <U>The Avatar's Character</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>3.3.1 <U>Will the gypsy be used to generate characters?</U></B><BR><BR>

Character creation is still being detailed.. The plan is to bring back the gypsy, although how exactly she'll be used is not defined at this point. Also, there's been some talk about sending the player through some sort of a directed mini-quest, where the choices the player makes defines the type of player he becomes.  Players, however, when they realize what's happening, usually go back through the whole process making the choices that will get them to the character they want, which sort of defeats the whole purpose.<BR><BR>

<B>3.3.2 <U>Character Transfer.</U></B><BR><BR>

Transferring your character of The Avatar was a feature of the older  Ultimas  (this  option  was  left  out  from  Ultima  VII onwards).  Can  we transfer the  Avatar's stats from Ultima VIII?  This seems very doubtful.<BR><BR>

<B>3.3.3 <U>Will the Avatar retain the powers gained in UVIII?</U></B><BR><BR>

In  short, no. Building up the character of the Avatar is part of  an Ultima. The Avatar will have  to work to gain strength and powers  in Ultima Ascension. By the end of the game, the player should have fully explored the powers of the Titan of Ether.<BR><BR>

<B>3.3.4<U>Will The Avatar be back in Ultima X?</U></B><BR><BR>

Lord British has indicated that Ascension will be the last Ultima to feature The Avatar as the protagonist.  Whether this means he will be killed or will become an NPC is unknown.  Additionally, whether or not Britannia will survive Ultima: Ascension remains to be seen.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4 <U>Companions, Party Members, and NPCs</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>3.4.1 <U>Will companions from previous Ultimas appear in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes,  the  companions  will return.  However, the Avatar will be adventuring alone in Ascension.<BR><BR>

Other  characters  with  sufficient  reason  to  have  a  long lifespan  will also appear in Ascension. In general, these are characters from other worlds.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.2 <U>Will Dupre return?</U></B><BR><BR>

In short, yes, according to Lord British.  Origin has hinted in the past that Dupre would return in an NPC role, such as having a cameo appearance sometime during the course of the game.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.3 <U>Is Iolo still alive?</U></B><BR><BR>

Why do you think Iolo might not be alive?<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.4 <U>Will there be party members in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.  There is no party in Ascension, but there might be traveling companions who will join the Avatar in his travels to help with specific tasks and who will have their own agendas for joining him.  Origin is staying quiet on the issue of temporary companions until the details are finalized.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.4.1 <U>Although there is not a party system planned for Ascension is there any possibility that this could change?</U></B><BR><BR>

CST said to RG.. "well, the party system has come up again, and they're asking about different ways the party could be accomplished, and offering ideas, etc.." <BR><BR>

RG says: NO.<BR><BR> 

CST says: Well.. yeah, I figured..<BR><BR> 

RG laughs and says with wide eyes: NO!<BR><BR> 

CST says, timidly: heehee.. but<BR><BR> 

RG says: Marketing is pushing for it, the fans are pushing for it, everyone wants it, but I've decided no. I hear you! I get the picture! But it's No. That's the answer. No.<BR><BR> 

CST says: Gotcha.<BR><BR> 

RG laughs and says: Tell them I said so. No!<BR><BR> 

<B>3.4.5 <U>Will Lord British actually help to save Britannia in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Although Lord British has been less-than-helpful in past Ultimas, Origin has stated that Lord British will actually join the effort to help defeat The Guardian this time around.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.6 <U>Will I be able to play more than one character in the game?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.  Although Lord British's intention was to allow the player to assume the role of more than just the character of the Avatar during the course of Ascension, it was taken out of the game because it served to weaken the emotional link between the player and the Avatar.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.7 <U>How many NPCs (non-player characters) will there be in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="new.gif">The U:A team is expecting to have between 200 and 250 total NPCs in the game.  Out of this total, 175 NPCs will be completely unique, with their own scripted conversations.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.7.1 <U>Will 'non-relevant' NPCs (guards, general townfolk etc.) be able to interact in ways other than "Name, Job, Bye"? Also, will the combined number of relevant and non-relevant NPCs be enough to give settlements the proper "populated" feel that U6 and U7 had?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes! All characters have purpose, generally speaking. Many have side, or mini-quests, and are also involved on the main plot. And many, if not all, will be able to provide some service, like providing training.  And yes, the combined number of relevant and non-relevant NPC's will be similar to the feel of U6 and U7.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.7.2 <U>Will we be able to see NPCs doing their jobs -- blacksmiths making swords, bakers making bread, etc.?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, you will be able to see merchants doing their jobs.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.8 <U>Will the Gargoyles be back in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, and they're more-horrific looking than ever.<BR><BR>

<B>3.4.9 <U>Will Sherry the Mouse appear in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Currently, Sherry the Mouse is not in the game. However, that doesn't necessarily preclude her from appearing in the final product.<BR><BR>

<B>3.5 <U>Magic</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>3.5.1 <U>How important is magic in the plot of Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Magic will play an integral part of the game.<BR><BR>  

<B>3.5.2 <U>What kind of a magic system will be utilized in Ultima: Ascension?  Will it be spellbook-based or ritual-based?</U></B><BR><BR>

You should expect to see a spellbook and ritual spell casting. That doesn't mean that spell book spells with be ritual spells.  They are separate types of spells. The plan for the system is that it will be extremely customizable, so that you can use your function keys any way you want.  You could fill them up with 12 spells and cast them "on the fly" like in the demo. The spells will cost you something, however, like mana, and "on the fly" spells will be restricted by something of that nature.<BR><BR>

<B>3.5.3 <U>How many spells will there be?</U></B><BR><BR>

At this point Origin estimates that there will be between 40 and 72 spells in Ascension.<BR><BR>

<B>3.5.4 <U>Will the "ritual" magic be based on the pentagram system found in Ultima 8 or will it return to a more socially and spiritually acceptable form of gameplay?</U></B><BR><BR>

There will be pentagram based magic spells in U:A. Not all spells will utilize the pentagram.<BR><BR>

<B>3.5.4.1 <U>If ritual magic is going to be included, am I going to spend the rest of my life trying to find the right location to place the reagents around the pentagram?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.  Reagent placement will seemingly play a role in ritual magic, but the system will most likely be more forgiving than Pagan's magic system.<BR><BR>

<B>3.5.5 <U>Will reagents still be used for the magic system?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, but they won't be used in the same manner as they have been in past Ultimas.  In U:A reagents will be used once to "bind" a spell into the Avatar's spellbook, and once the spell is bound the only thing required to cast the spell is mana.<BR><BR>

<B>3.5.5.1 <U>Will we be able to find the reagents in the wilderness, too (like the Nightshade in U4) or can we just buy them?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, you will be able to find some reagents in the wilderness<BR><BR>

<B>3.6 <U>Miscellaneous Plot Questions</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>3.6.1 <U>Will dragons be involved in the storyline?</U></B><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="new.gif">Yes.  In addition to the cinematic screenshots featuring dragons, the  Ultima VIII end sequence shows dragons flying around in the sky.<BR><BR>

Unfortunately, the Avatar will neither be able to ride nor tame the dragons.<br><br>

<B>3.6.2 <U>How much time has passed since Ultima VIII: Pagan?</U></B><BR><BR>

According to Lord British, thirty Britannian years have passed since The Black Gate and the time that the Avatar returns from Pagan. <BR><BR>

Given the amazing amount of aging that Lord British has undergone in a relatively short period of time it's safe to say that he has become one of the Guardian's playthings.<br><br>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/lordbrit.jpg"><IMG SRC="lordbrit.gif"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/lb.jpg"><IMG SRC="lb.gif"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/u9-3.jpg"><IMG SRC="u9-3.gif"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<B>3.6.3 <U>Will there be dungeons in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  The Britannian dungeons will return in Ascension, and they're going to be huge and multileveled.  In fact, there will be times when you will be able to see up or down shafts to other levels in the dungeon.<BR><BR>

<B>3.6.3.1 <U>Will dungeons connect to each other underground?</U></B><BR><BR>

Some of them will, yes.<BR><BR>

<B>3.6.3.2 <U>Will there be varying themes and architecture styles for the dungeons?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.<BR><BR>

<B>3.6.3.3 <U>Will there be NPC's living in them?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.<BR><BR>

<B>3.6.4 <U>Will some items from previous Ultimas return? The Magebane, the Hoe of Destruction, Skull of Mondain, Bell, Book, Lighter-than-air-device, etc.?</U></B><BR><BR>

Some will return yes, and some will not. You could ask that about every item, and the answer will be with the same... but we don't want to reveal exactly which.<BR><BR>

<B>3.6.5 <U>Will the lost continent of Ambrosia reappear in Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.<br><br>

<B>3.6.6 <U>Will there be readable books in U:A? If so, how will the reading be handled by the game?  What will the length of the books be?</U></B><BR><BR>

There will be readable books in U:A, of about the same length as those in U7. A picture of the book will come up like in U7... RG was hoping to get a 3d book with turning pages, but the programmers say no for now.<BR><BR>

<B>3.6.7 <U>Will the avatar be able to get drunk, weave, stumble, fall down as in Ultima VIII?</U></B><BR><BR>

He will probably have the visible signs of drunkenness.<BR><BR>

<B>3.6.8 <U>How would the team rate the nastiness factor in U:A? Like SI or U8?</U></B><BR><BR>

U:A is being designed to be an emotionally impactful game, with some important differences from those other two.<BR><BR>

<B>3.6.9 <U>Will the lighthouses from Ultima V be in U:A?  How about the Isle of Fire from Ultima VII?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, there will be lighthouses. The Isle of Fire is still there, as well.<BR><BR>

<B>3.7 <U>The Ending</U></B><BR><BR>

Will the Guardian finally be defeated for good?  Will the Avatar or Britannia still exist after UIX?  They're not telling :)
