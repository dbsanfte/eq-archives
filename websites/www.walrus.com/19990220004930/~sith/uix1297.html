According to a follow-up <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_12/23_ultnine/index.html" TARGET="_parent"> Gamespot article</a>, Origin is now starting to become less tight-lipped about Ultima IX.  Here are the highlights:<br><br>

<LI>Ed Del Castillo, formerly of Westwood Studios (where he produced Command & Conquer and Command & Conquer: Red Alert), is now the producer of Ultima IX.<br><br>

<LI>Ultima IX's expected ship date is now Fall 1998.<br><br>

<LI>While Ultima IX was originally planned as a standard top-down RPG, technical advances have prompted Origin to adopt a third-person "trailing" point of view, a la Tomb Raiders 1 and 2.  Unlike Tomb Raider, however, Ultima IX's world will be a seamless environment unbroken by area loading.<br><br>

<LI>Ultima IX will natively support the 3DFX chipset, as well as support Direct 3D.  Other chipsets may be supported as well.<br><br>

<LI>During the course of gameplay, players will have the opportunity to play more characters than the Avatar, with the viewpoint and control changing to that of other, notable Britannians.<br><br>

According to a <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_12/22_ultcoll/index.html" TARGET="_parent"> Gamespot article</a>, a video trailer for Ultima IX will be included as a bonus with the Ultima Collection due out from Origin in February.  The forthcoming Ultima Collection will include all of the mainline Ultimas (minus the Worlds of Ultima and Underworld titles), along with the additional bonuses of a Win 95 version of Akalabeth and a video interview with Lord British.  Thanks, Joe!<br><br>

According to the upcoming software listing on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.3dfx.com/voodoo/software/index.html" TARGET="_parent">3DFX website</A>, Ultima IX will be utilizing the Glide API rather than Microsoft's Direct3D to handle 3D acceleration.  Thanks, Cold Fire!<br><br><br>
