<U>28 December 1998</U><br><br>

Yavn, from the U:A design team, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> on Christmas to answer a handful of questions:<br><br>

Here's Yavn on the question of the game's launcher, and whether or not it will be like the ones we've seen in Ultimas past:<br><br>

<i>We have not finished the launcher, although we will start working on it in January.  We will pass on more information soon.</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on what the U:A team would like for Christmas:<br><br>
 
<i>Good question.  Peace on Earth?  No more hunger? All the worlds problems solved?  Actually, I'd would be happy if the  fans keep supporting us, and staying excited about Ultima Ascension. ( a new dual Pentium 450 would also be nice).</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on whether or not every character in the game will be killable:<br><br>

<i>Right now the plan is to allow everyone to be killed.  Yes, Lord British can be killed, but not by normal means....<br><br>

This is subject to change as we see what effect it has on the balance of the game.</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on whether or not non-monster animals will be in the game:<br><br>

<i>Yes, there are animals in the game, although the player will not be able to ride them.  As for how many, I don't want to spoil anything, but there are several different kinds!</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on the game's compass, a bit on the camera, and in-game tool tips:<br><br>

<i>The compass sits in the lower left corner of the screen.  It can be turned on, or off.  Presently it can not be moved.<br><br>

The camera can be pitch locked.<br><br>

Placing the cursor over an object brings up a tool tip, so the name of objects can be found easily.</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn expanding on the camera's behavior:<br><br>

<i>The player can lock the pitch of the camera.  We do not have any plans for pre-assigned cameras, although that is a good idea.</i><br><br>

And here's Yavn again on the question of reagents:<br><br>

<i>Reagents can be found or bought.  Some will be more common then others, and much more difficult to find.  As with previous Ultimas, the reagents needed for spells are related to the functions of the spell.</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn clarifying a statement he made in the Gamecenter U:A preview:<br><br>

<i>Stonegate Tower is made up of 5 floors.  What I should have said, was that each FLOOR teaches a different skill.  All of the floors are on the same map, and movement is seemless between the floors.</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on why things have been quiet on the U:A front lately:<br><br>

<i>Thanks for all the support of all the fans, and everyone involved with this board.  We are indeed taking time off for the holidays, and will be fully refreshed, and ready to get back to work in January.  I hope everyone has a safe and wonderful holiday.</i><br><br>

<U>23 December 1998</U><br><br>

Cap'n Bill, lead programmer on U:A, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to take on a couple of questions:<br><br>

Here's Bill on the subject of system requirements and whether or not a Pentium 200 will be up to the task:<br><br>

<i>It's our plan for our minimum platform to run well, to be an enjoyable experience, and not frustrate the player.  I personally dislike "minimum platforms" that are really lower than what's needed, and we're making every effort to make the P200 a genuinely playable experience.<br><br>

You might think about going with our "recommended" level of RAM, though; RAM is cheaper to upgrade than your CPU, and you'll benefit in all your Windows apps.  Our "recommended" RAM level will be higher than 32MB.<br><br>

You will have to use 8-bit textures on your Voodoo1 card.  But, most of our dev team still uses Voodoo1's with 8-bit, and they run fine, and it demos well.</i><br><br>
 
And here's Bill on whether or not the game's clipping plane will be configurable by players:<br><br>
 
<i>The clipping plane will be settable by the player, through the options screen.  I don't know if any option will specifically say "clipping plane".  It may read something like "More Speed <-----------> More Detail".  Selecting "more detail" would move the clipping plane out further.  But I think the current plan is for a slider just for the clipping plane.</i><br><br>

<U>21 December 1998</U><br><br>

Lady Moi posted this bit on USENET regarding character animation in U:A:<br><br>

<i>U9 is using a skeletal animation system... Scott Wetterschneider (U9 artist,animator extraordinaire) confirms for me that it is, in fact, similar to Half Life's - although I'm not personally familiar with that game.. (c'mon christmas break!.. heehee).<br><br> 

He told me that with such a system, we can reduce the amount of data we need to store to create animation in the game. However, the trade off is that we don't get bouncing ponytail hair or giggling bottoms or things of that nature, because we treat the model as a skeleton, rather than as a bunch of independant vertices.</i><br><br> 

Cap'n Bill, U:A's lead programmer, spent quite a bit of time on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> this weekend:<br><br>

Here's Bill on what the programming team's been up to lately:<br><br>

<i>Well, I'm back after a long, long crunch session.  We're finally almost out of our long rewrite phase.  New renderer, new animation system, new Kernel & process management, new spell code, new mesh & art importer, new conversation system.  Whew!  Yesterday, we finally got animation working again
after a really long struggle!  Many thanks to all the hardworking programmers on the team!  And, many thanks to our management for having the patience to get us through this.  Feature-wise, the new code is close to the old stuff.  But it's all much faster & more stable.  Animation looks better than ever before!  We've also added a bunch of new features.  The weather looks pretty awesome.  Drag-and-drop equipping is working.  We have a new particle system for spells!  We have levels of detail for buildings & characters.  So, you
can now push the clipping plane out much further than before.  Lighting is faster now, too.<br><br>

So, now that I'm on vacation, I'll be posting to the board more!  I'm glad to not be coding for a while, but I just can't tear myself completely away from Ascension!!</i><br><br>
 
Here's Bill on the subject of the size of saved games, and whether the 'Journey Onward' menu option will allow you to choose which saved game to load:<br><br> 
 
<i>We haven't completed our save/load code yet, but I agree it should operate as you've described, with multiple saves available.</i><br><br>

And here's Bill on the question of music:<br><br>
 
<i>We have no "official" music for the product yet, so the MIDI files you have aren't associated with UA.<br><br>

I don't think we plan to have continuous music...it'll be tied to events and desired moods in the game.</i><br><br>
 
Here's Bill on whether or not U:A will be developed for any console systems:<br><br> 
 
<i>Currently, we have no plans to develop UA for those platforms.</i><br><br>
 
And here's Bill on the question of system specs:<br><br>
 
<i>There are a lot of cards that UA will work just fine with, and if you have one of these, you'll be set, video-wise.  These include, but are not limited to, Voodoo2, Voodoo Banshee, and TNT and other power-house D3D cards, especially AGP cards.<br><br> 

However, there are other important factors to consider when spec'ing out your system: CPU speed and RAM.  The faster the CPU, the more you'll enjoy the game.  Our recommended platform will probably end up being around a P300.  But, if you have a P400, you'll get that much more out of the engine.
Also, RAM is very important.  The more RAM you have, the faster the game runs.  Same guidelines apply here--our min spec RAM will probably be 32MB, with 64MB being "recommended".  But, if you have 128MB, you'll get even
better performance.  The point is, the video card isn't necessarily the limiting factor in your system...</i><br><br>

Here's Bill breaking the hearts of folks who thought they could play the game on Pentium 133's:<br><br>
 
<i>I won't beat around the bush here.  A P133 won't cut it.  You won't be happy at all playing the game with that platform.  Like Durham indicated, your RAM is OK.  But you need a faster CPU!</i><br><br>

<U>18 December 1998</U><br><br>

Lady Moi returned to the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to talk more about shadows in the game:<br><br>

<i>I'll fish out the talk about shadows and repost it here.. (all hail sith's site.. woowoo)<br><br>  

This is from the FAQ, and the answer came from Bill Randolph in September I believe....<br><br>

"If there will be night and day, does that mean the game will have shadows?<br><br>

Currently, nothing casts shadows... but it's a feature we'd like to add and everyone tells us to add, but we haven't figured out how to do it well."<br><br>

So, I asked for a re-cap on this from BR and he says that we know exactly how to do a shadow, but the implementation costs in time and energy are too expensive to the development right now.</i><br><br>  

Here are two high-resolution versions of the screenshots seen in the January 1999 edition of <i>Computer Gaming World</i>:<br><br>

<div align="center"><A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/SethGroup2.jpg"><IMG SRC="SethGroup2.gif"></A></div><br><br>

<div align="center"><A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/Zombie.jpg"><IMG SRC="Zombie.gif"></A></div><br><br>

Thanks, Lady Moi!<br><br>

Lady Moi, responding to questions raised about the shadows in the batch of screenshots from the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.gamecenter.com/Peeks/Ascension/" TARGET="_parent">Gamecenter U:A preview</A>, spoke on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> yesterday:<br><br>

<i>The art was doctored.  I don't know why, or to what end... but they went out as such.  There are no shadows in U:A and there is no current plan to implement them.</i><br><br>

[Ed: I have to give Origin a point for quickly owing up to the screenshot doctoring, but I have to deduct two for having done it in the first place.  Note to Origin:  you don't <i>need</i> to fake screenshots -- we're already more than impressed by the graphics.]<br><br>

<U>17 December 1998</U><br><br>

Here's Audball, from the U:A team, talking about mixing and matching armor on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A>:<br><br>

<i>Yes, absolutely you can mix/match any piece of armor.  Here are the "body sections" that are currently used:<br><br>

<LI>Head<br>
<LI>Main body (neck, torso, waist)<br>
<LI>Upper legs (left/right thigh)<br>
<LI>Lower legs (left/right shin, left/right foot)<br>
<LI>Upper arms (left/right bicep)<br>
<LI>Lower arms (left/right forearm, left/right hand)<br>

Left and right go together: if you pick up some guantlets and put them on, both left and right forearms/hands are covered.</i><br><br>

<U>16 December 1998</U><br><br>

Here's an answer from Yavn that slipped by me on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A>:<br><br>

On the question of side quests in the game<br><br>

<i>We are planing to have many side quests, some plot related, and some not.  The game does follow a story, although the player will have plenty of time to explore the world, adventure around, and go on some side quests.  As for the
number, or hints on any, you will have to wait, we are still tuning many of them.</i><br><br>

There's a <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.gamecenter.com/Peeks/Ascension/" TARGET="_parent">great new preview of U:A</A> over at Gamecenter that you'll definitely want to take a look at, and includes a ton of new screenshots:<br><br>

Thanks, Gamecenter!<br><br>

Things are really beginning to hop again over on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A>:<br><br>

Here's Trellek on the subject of the game's physics system:<br><br>

<i>Moving a box out from under a stack of boxes was one of the reasons we decided to implement a physics system that allows objects to rotate. Objects in Ultima 8, in contrast, could only slide around, since the art was done as 2D sprites and the collision system only worked with cubes.<br><br>

Although Ascension has a rudimentary physics system, it isn't the focus of the game and doesn't have all the features of a physics-based game. Barrels are really polygonal rather than round, so they don't roll all that well. Pivots aren't designed into the system as currently implemented. However,
objects do react and rebound when they hit, and float or sink in water depending on their weight and volume.</i><br><br>
 
Here's Jaccl on monsters and monster AI:<br><br>

<i>Several of us are currently working on honing creature AI.  As far as magic creatures are concerned, there are a variety, some of them are smart, some of them are not. The smart creatures will use their resources in an intelligent fashion. There are definitely 'mages' in the game thou not all of
them are the classical humanoid type. :)</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on when we'll see one of Britannia's rivers:<br><br>

<i>You want to see a shot of a river?  We will try a picture of a river in the next set of screens we release.<br><br>

Ask and you shall receive!</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on the Christmas gift for fans that was mentioned in the past:<br><br>

<i>We are working on something for the fans, and will let you know the moment it's ready...</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on the Codex, Virtues, and Codex Lenses:<br><br>

<i>Yes, the Avatar will need to follow the 8 virtues.  Yes, the Codex will play an important part in the story.  And yes, the 2 lenses are also going to be important.  I don't want to give away too much more, but I hope that answers some of your questions.</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on the subject of the Avatar's clothing options:<br><br>

<i>Sorry to disappoint, but we currently have no plans for capes.  We do have over 10 different sets of armor for the Avatar, so he will have lots of cool things to wear.</i><br><br> 

Here's Yavn with a brief update on the progress of the team and game:<br><br>
 
<i>Right now as we approach the holidays, things are going very well.  As in any development cycle there are many ups and downs.  The design is really coming together, and we are going through all the systems to make sure they are perfect.<br><br>

I truly believe that this is the best team in Ultima history, and when we finish, you will not be disappointed.  Keep up the questions, and we will do our best to answer them.</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on the question of the demo:<br><br>

<i>The topic of a demo is something we talk about all the time.   What it will be, and when it will be out, I can't answer at this time.  I know that's not what you want to hear, but until we have the "Right" demo (People got the wrong impression from the demo we showed at E3), we will keep working on it.  We will let you know as soon as we have the answers.</i><br><br>

Here's Yavn on keeping plots holes out of the story:<br><br>

<i>We are going to do our best to keep plot holes / NPC holes out of the game.  We have some experts on the problem (Craig Bowlin, Chuck Zoch) who have worked with conversation systems on many games before.  We have already started going through the story, and each of the designers is taking extra time to
wipe out problems.</i><br><br>

And here's Yavn on the subject of combat:<br><br>

<i>Not sure I really want to touch this one...  Yes, you will need to use both the mouse and keyboard for combat, although we believe that what we have come up with works very well, and is not arcade-like.  IronFury was correct about real time vs. turn based combat.  We have spoken about this quite a bit, and I have no new information to pass on.  When we finish combat, I'll give an update, and  take your questions.</i><br><br>

And here he is on the subject of the game's accessibility to new players:<br><br>

<i>We have made an extra effort to give new players, and those who have missed an Ultima or 2, all the history of the world.  There will be no need to have any past Ultima experience, although the people who have played Ultimas before will see a lot of old friends, and be privy to in jokes.</i><br><br>

And here's Yavn on the subject of a possible release party:<br><br>

<i>I'm sure when Ascension ships we will have one HUGE party...The fans will have to wait for us to recover before we make any patches!!</i><br><br>

<U>15 December 1998</U><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> this afternoon to answer a question concerning NPC facial animation:<br><br>

<i>Faces aren't animated in game.  The high res models during the cut scene do have synched up speech... In game, there are a variety of gestures and
animations the npc's can use.... but not subtle facial motions.</i><br><br>

Audball, from the U:A sound team, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> this afternoon to discuss U:A and MP3:<br><br>

<i>You are correct in that MP3 is an excellent compression scheme and has very good sound quality.  However, DurhamDragon is also correct in that using MP3 would have a severe performance penalty.  To use MP3, you'd either have to
(1) decompress on-the-fly, which would drastically impact framerate and other game functions, or (2) decompress at level-load time, store the audio in memory, and playback the uncompressed data, a technique which would require large amounts of memory.  In our case, that memory is better used by object/terrain meshes and/or data caches so you can see more on the screen at once, get better perfomance, smoother gameplay, etc...</i><br><br>

<U>14 December 1998</U><br><br>

Audball, from the U:A sound team, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> this afternoon to answer a few questions:<br><br>

On whether or not the game will support the forthcoming EAX 2.0:<br><br>

<i>Depends on what support it offers, how easy the new support is to incorporate, when it's available, etc.  (Realize that there isn't even an SDK for it yet...)</i><br><br>

On U:A speech and compression schemes:<br><br>

<i>Currently, all audio in the game can be uncompressed .WAVs (if we decide we want particular things to sound perfect, avoiding quality loss that compression introduces), or compressed with a variant of XA compression that gets about a 3.7:1 compression ratio (and still sounds very good). 
Whether we use a different codec for speech is probably a minor issue - it wouldn't take that long for me to write a new audio streamer that uses it;  however, there are bigger fish to fry at this point.</i><br><br>

The January 1998 issue of <i>PC Gamer</i> had a two-page article on U:A accompanied by a handful of new screenshots.  The article's pretty good, too, so it's definitely worth picking up a copy to read it:<br><br>

Thanks, Rafic!<br><br>

Here are some U:A answers that fell through the cracks over on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A>:<br><br>

Here's Audball, from U:A's sound team, on the question of A3D versus EAX support:<br><br>

<i>At this stage in development, it would NOT be easy to add full WaveTracing support to *this* game.  (Consider editor changes, in-game changes, database changes, potential modeller plugins/exporters to facilitate surface tagging,
etc.).  Simply passing a set of geometry to the Vortex2 processor is probably indeed simple, but that alone does not give you full immersion.  Geometry itself isn't enough; surface properties must also be taken into account, and I see that as the bigger hurdle.  (There are obviously other issues, such as how our world geometry is divided / organized / loaded, and how that affects downloading to the audio processor, which affects framerate, etc., etc.)<br><br>

The decision to implement EAX was made before the A3D 2.0 SDK was out of beta, and our production schedule reflects this.  EAX may not provide as mathematically "correct" a representation as WaveTracing, but it can be tailored to give good effects (we'll have to wait and see how EAX 2.0 does
things).  If we have time to revisit the issue before we ship, who knows, maybe we'll put support in.</i><br><br> 

Here's Yos, from the U:A design team, discussing monsters and their behavior in the game:<br><br>

<i>We should have around thirty different monsters in the game, many (if not most) looking completely different.  We will, of course, have some variations on the same type of monster (i.e. Goblin, Goblin Sergent). Yes, Our AI will be extremely cool.  Creatures can taunt you, run away, attack each other, talk to you etc...</i><br><br>  

<U>9 December 1998</U><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> this afternoon to answer a question concerning the camera's behavior:<br><br>

<i>The camera's pitch can be locked, or zoomed in and out, but the Avatar will alays face forward and moving the mouse left and right will cause the surrounding to rotate. The Avatar will have some head movement and body movement as you move the camera, but for all intents and purposes,
saying he is facing forward during normal movement is pretty accurate.</i><br><br>

According to this <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/news/5265.html" TARGET="_parent">article</A> just out on the Next Generation Online website, U:A's release date has been pushed back to the second quarter of 1999.<br><br>

While it's heartening to see that Origin is putting quality ahead of financial return, I have to say that I never thought I would actually see a new Star Wars movie in the theatres <i>before</i> I would see a new Ultima.<br><br>

<U>8 December 1998</U><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> this afternoon to answer a handful of questions:<br><br>

On whether or not Origin will be releasing any of the music from the game in the near future:<br><br>

<i>Yup.  We're going to try to do that as soon as possible.  We're
waiting to get some of the finished bits back.  :)</i><br><br>

On the progress of the Direct 3D version of the game (channeling the spirit of Bill, the game's lead programmer)<br><br>

<i>Bill's got a busy day of meetings.  (A moment of silence, please.)  But he was kind enough to forward me a quick response to the latest D3D question...<br><br>

"Answer: D3D still expected to look just like Glide.  Existing screen shots should look the same under either Glide or D3D."</i><br><br>

On how the camera will behave in the game verus the camera in a conventional isometric game:<br><br>

<i>In an isometric game, when yer char turns left or right, the camera sees you in profile.  In Ascension, the camera will always be behind your head.  So if you look right, the camera will swing right.  If the avatar turns left, the camera will move left.</i><br><br>  

And on whether or not anything fans say makes a difference in the design of the game:<br><br>

<i>All your input does make a difference, and the team appreciates the time you take to share your thoughts here on these forums.<br><br>

In some cases, the suggestions only require a slight modification of the existing system, or are already in place... in some cases, the suggestions are thought to be quite good, but are unable to be implemented, as bluehair
states, at this stage of development.<br><br>

However, that doesn't mean you should stop making the suggestions.  So what if the idea doesn't make it into Ascension.. the developers are reading your posts and probably are influenced by the suggestions and ideas they
read here.  Maybe one of your ideas becomes a part of Ultima X.  :)</i><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to answer the question of handicapped accessability in U:A's design:<br><br>

<i>Bill's been busy, so I'm posting for him...<br><br>

"First, our interface is designed to be HIGHLY configurable.  You can assign any key to any game command.  So, you can move forward with either the mouse button, or an arrow key.<br><br> 

Some commands, however, will probably require the mouse button.  For instance, the left mouse button is designed to select or use the object it's pointing at.  And we currently aren't able to map a key press onto that; you have to
actually use the mouse button.<br><br>

This is a 3D game.  But, it's not a dexterity test like other 3D games.  The movement through the world is meant to be intuitive and simple, not requiring lots of key combinations.  But, our movement is designed to work the
mouse button and some other keys, in combination, requiring at least two fingers.  Combat, especially, would be a problem for someone not able to pull this off quickly.<br><br>

So, in short, much of the game would be playable, no problem.  But there are definitely areas that will be difficult, such as combat.<br><br>

Might I suggest a speech recognition solution?  There are programs out there that will "stuff" keypresses into the PC's keyboard buffer based on speech commands, which "fool" the application into thinking a key has been pressed.  Your friend might be able to use this in conjunction with the mouse or other keys to make combat more playable.  For example, if ALT-left-arrow is meant to make the Avatar side-step to the left, your friend might be able to press the
left arrow key and say "Side" to "press" the ALT key, making the Avatar side-step as desired.   Just a thought.  I can't recommend a specific Speech Recognizer at this time, I haven't worked with them for several years.</i><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> this weekend to address the question of of how the Avatar's model functions in the game's engine:<br><br>

<i>Audball is busy, so I'm posting for him. I asked this question of Audball, and he has supplied me with this:<br><br>

"Currently, there is only one "layer" per "body part" that can be equipped.  For instance, the Avatar's "torso, waist and neck" can either be "naked", "equiped with the platemail chestplate", "equipped with the ringmail chestpiece", etc.<br><br>

As for capes, we could have the artists work up an "equipment piece" that contains a cape - for example, simply change the "leather armor torso" model to have a cape integrated into that same piece.  Granted, it would look
somewhat silly that the cape "comes with" the chestpiece, but the layer limit is what makes that so.<br><br>

As for battle damage: what it requires is either: dynamic textures, texture overlays, texture combining, or multiple body/armor/equipped models/pieces - all of which are very costly at this stage in development, and so may not  appear in the final game."</i><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> today, and seemingly confirmed that U:A -- or at least parts of the game -- have entered Quality Assurance:<br><br>

<i>Tim from QA was kind enough to give me an answer to this question... so,
here are his words:<br><br>

"Origin is committed to making sure Ultima: Ascension meets the highest standard of excellence.  An experienced group of Origin testers is checking every aspect of the game to make sure that the game meets the quality and playability standards that our customers expect. "</i><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> today to taunt us with information about U:A's ending cinematic:<br><br>

<i>Difficult questions...  but without giving too much away... the story ending will be stunning... you should have a sense that the major characters have come to fruition or actualized, the plot arc should be resolved, and the questions answered.<br><br> 

As for the cinematics.. well, I didn't want to.. but for you guys I went and had a look at the low res versions of the ending.  (darn you all)  The finals aren't in yet... in any case... they will be stunning... some of the animation is just breathtaking.. some of the effects are really incredible.  I don't want to tell you how long it lasts tho.. seems like that gives too much away.  It lasts -a few- minutes.  Just to leave it open ended... :)  hahah.</i><br><br>
