<U>1 January 1998</U><BR><BR>

I played Ultima Online for the last time this evening.  This decision had been a long time coming, but I guess the thing that made me decide that tonight was the last night was the fact that I actually had to talk myself into breaking away from the other games I'm playing to sign off of Ultima Online.<BR><BR>

It had been so long since I last played that I could no longer remember where my character was, and was somewhat surprised to find myself in the woods across the bay to the west of Yew.  This had always been my favorite hunting area, in the strip of land running along the coast on the western side of the mountains, so I was somewhat surprised to find the woods devoid of any sort of animal, monster or player.  I traveled south, avoiding the roads, and picked my way through the woods and came upon the Yew/Skara Brae/Britain crossroads, where a large group of players were arguing with one another.  I had seen arguments like this collapse into small-scale wars before, and since I did not wish to get involved I decided to continue on my way to Britain.<BR><BR>

I stopped by the shipwright and purchased a small boat and a map of the world, then headed into the town center to the carpenter's shop.  In the shop I found the normally-absent architect and purchased the deed to the tower that I always wanted.  I headed south toward the bank, and emptied my safe deposit box of all the things I wished to take with me.  What I did not want, or no longer needed, I dropped to the ground and laughed to myself as the vultures descended.<BR><BR>

I left Britain and headed south along the coast, and soon was standing on the wide beach.  No ships were in sight, so I launched my own boat, boarded it, and slowly pulled out into Britannia Bay.  I opened up the map of the world, and wondered about where I should go -- I had seen so much of Britannia in the months of the beta, as well as in the months since the game went public, that I had trouble thinking of a place I hadn't been.  Then, somewhat ironically, I realized that I had never been to the Isle of the Avatar, so I set the course on my map, gave it to the tillerman, and began the long trip.  Lag this evening was awful so the trip took about an hour, but soon I was seeing the coast of the isle for the first time.<BR><BR>

I sailed parallel to the lush jungle coastline, then lowered the gangplank and walked onto the isle.  I started toward the treeline, then stopped and remembered to open my backpack.  I dropped the ship's key onto the shore nearest to the gangplank, then turned and headed into the jungle.  The isle was unfamiliar to me as I searched for a clearing or beach to build my tower, but all I could find was more jungle, multitudes of houses with names like "Da HoUsE" or "The Britannian Cocaine Dealer's Shipping House", and dense, nearly impassible stretches of forest.  An hour passed as I searched vainly for a place to set down roots and build, but I saw no clearings, nor any monsters, players or animals for that matter.<BR><BR>

I stood in a walled area surrounded by volcanos, dismembered bodies, and a bloody ankh on a dias topped by a human sacrifical altar.  I looked on my map to try and figure out what it was, and I have to admit a certain amount of disgust when it dawned on me that this must be the Shrine of Sacrifice.  I had clear memories of finding the Shrine of Sacrifice all those years ago when Ultima IV first came out -- the joy I felt after all the weeks searching for it, not to mention the battle it took to actually get into the shrine -- and not once did I ever imagine that the shrine looked like this.<BR><BR>

Then, suddenly, my feelings about Ultima Online seemed to crystalize.  Impressions that had seemed muddy and hard to put into words or thought became clear for the first time -- Ultima Online was a post-modern Ultima.  The virtues, the sense of ethics, the very things that were the heart and soul of Ultima (at least for me) were cast away by the new aesthetic as being naive and quaint.  My blocky and pixelated Commodore 64 Shrine of Sacrifice, once a place of emotional attachement for me because of the difficulties in getting there all those years ago, had been replaced by a umpteen bagillion color killing field with decapitated heads, dismembered bodies, and entrails spread out before me like a Jackson Pollack work in progress.  The Ultima ankh, meaningful enough for me to actually have had one tattooed onto my left arm, became something I did not recognize surrounded, as it was, by dismembered bodies and a pentagram painted in blood.<BR><BR>

I left the Shrine of Sacrifice and wandered north into the jungle.  What had plagued me for so long about Ultima Online now seemed clear -- Ultima Online was not Ultima.  I have played Lord British's games since Akalabeth first came out on the Apple almost two decades ago, and latched onto them because (although I did not know it at the time) the ethical system presented in the games helped to form my own as I was growing up.  Although I might not admit it readily, many, many of my fond adolescent memories are of the times my friends and I competed with one another in trying to find Planet X in Ultima II, the Mark of Fire in Ultima III, to see who would become enlightened first in all eight virtues in Ultima IV, or who would be the first to save Lord British a second time because we forgot the sandalwood box in Ultima V the first time into the Underworld.<BR><BR>

As I wandered through the jungle I recognized that while the form might look like Ultima, the vital, beating essence of the series was not there.  I stopped in a small clearing and pulled up my character's paperdoll and continued walking.  Continuing north through the trees, I began to leave a trail of my belongings as I stripped myself of arms and armor, and then started dropping my backpacks.  Soon there was nothing left except for the deed to my tower.  I felt it was somewhat ironic that there was no room for me on this new Isle of the Avatar as I dropped the deed onto the ground.  I felt like waiting awhile to see how long it would take for the vultures to swoop down on the discarded remains of my character, but that was behind me now.  Coming into a clearing, I pulled up my paperdoll and quit Ultima Online.<br><br>
