<B>5.1 <U>Platforms</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>5.1.1 <U>Which platforms is Ascension currently targeted for?</U></B><BR><BR>

Ascension is a Windows 95/98 native program.<BR><BR>

<B>5.1.1.1 <U>Will Ascension run under Windows NT?</U></B><br><br>

Yes, but you will lose many of the benefits of running the game under Windows 95/98, like access to DirectX 5.0 and above.<br><br>

<B>5.1.2 <U>Will Ascension be released for game consoles?</U></B><BR><BR>

Given the release of other Origin titles for consoles, such as Crusader: No Remorse for the PSX, it  is  likely that Origin would like to port Ascension to other platforms  as  well.  However  there  are no concrete plans for them yet.<BR><BR>

<B>5.1.3 <U>Will there be a Mac version?</U></B><BR><BR>

There  is  a  possibility  that a  Mac  version  will be made.  However,  this  is  highly dependent on  the  sales of the Mac versions  of  Origin's other games.<BR><BR>

<B>5.1.4 <U>Will Ultima: Ascension be optimized for the AMD K6 2?</U></B><BR><BR>

We'd like to, but converting our code base over to using a different interface to the 3D math would take some time. Besides, we've measured our in-game performance, and vector transforms take up actually very little percentage of our time. Our main problem is shoving out the number of polygons our scenes require. But, if we speed up our renderer, and the -transforms- become a bottleneck, well who knows…<BR><BR>

You may have noticed that, while our clipping plane is pretty close, the detail of what you can see is very high. We have extremely high-poly-count models, and this is our main bottleneck right now. So we're building in lots and lot of scalability--levels of detail, etc, to help with that.<BR><BR>

<B>5.1.5 <U>Will Ascension utilize 3DNow! Technology</U></b><br><br>

They are going to attempt to include 3DNow! support, but are currently unsure of the performance gains they will achieve by doing so.<br><br>

<B>5.2 <U>Hardware</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>5.2.1 <U>Will Ascension utilize 3-D acceleration?</U></B><BR><BR>

U:A will definitely support 3D acceleration, but will no longer require it to run.  Of course, not having a 3D accelerator means that the game will play much more slowly.<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.2 <U>Will Ascension be 3DFX native?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  Ascension is planned to be a 3DFX native program.  However, other 3D chipsets will also be supported.<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.2.1 <U>Will Ascension feature any 3DFX goodies like colored lighting and such?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  Colored and moving lightsources are just some of the nifty tricks being included in Ascension.<BR><BR> 

<B>5.2.2.2 <U>Will U:A use multi-texturing (like Quake 2 does)? In other words, will it be an advantage to own a Voodoo2 or a Riva TNT which do multitexturing in a single pass over a card that must do multiple passes for multitextures?</U></B><BR><BR>

Currently we will not use multitexturing, says Bill Randolph. However, using a Voodoo 2 will give you an advantage in terms of speed and texture RAM.<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.2.3 <U>Will U:A use S3's Savage 3D texture compression?</U></B><BR><BR>

Currently, Bill Randolph is unfamiliar with the savage 3d's texture compression algorhythm, so I was asking about the various sizes of textures we use in Ascension and Scott Jones, one of our artists, tells me there is a variety, the highest being 256x256. Most are either 128x128 or 256x256. The textures are made in 16bit, but can be scaled back to 8bit on slower machines by virtue of a preferance switch. We currently aren't really using much texture compression however. Bill says we might add support for it if it makes a critical difference to a large enough percentage of popular cards.<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.3 <U>Will Ascension utilize the MMX2 instruction set?</U></B><BR><BR>

Bill Randolph says, "To the degree that D3D and glide support it, we will."<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.4 <U>Will we be able to run the game at different resolutions?</U></B><BR><BR>

At this point in the development process, Ascension only runs in a 640x480 screen resolution.  However, by the time the game actually ships players will be able to choose their preferred resolution.<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.5 <U>Will U:A support DirectX/Direct3D?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.6 <U>Will U:A support OpenGL?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.7 <U>Will U:A have a software rasterizer?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.<BR><BR>

<B>5.2.8 <U>Will Ultima: Ascension have an option to use the built-in Direct3D6 geometry/lighting algorithms?</U></B><BR><BR>

At this time, not enough hardware platforms support lighting for us to be able to rely on it at all--and, since our in-game lighting looks so darn good, we'd rather use that. Our lighting is incredibly scalable, and impacts performance minimally.   Bill Randolph says, "I'd be really hesitant to turn something as visually sensitive as lighting over to D3D--I'll wait a while until it's validated in other products first."<BR><BR>

<B>5.3 <U>Sound</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>5.3.1 <U>What type of music and sound will Ascension use?</U></B><br><br>  

Because Origin cannot guarantee the quality that MIDI gives, they have chosen to use streaming digital audio for music and any long special effects.  Currently the music is played as compressed 22kHz, sixteen-bit stereo.<br><br>

<B>5.3.2 <U>Will there be support for 3D sound?</U></B><BR><BR>

UA supports DirectSound and DirectSound3D. Things that should have a 3D sound do (bees, creaking signs, birds in trees, etc.)  Things that can get away with a 2D sound (ocean waves, wind, etc.) do not use 3D for performance reasons.<br><br>

<B>5.3.2.1 <U>Will Ascension support Creative Lab's Environmental Sound?</U></B><br><br>

Yes.<br><br>  
    
<B>5.3.3 <U>Is the sound scalable to my machine's performance?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes.  Sound use is scalable, controllable by the user from the options. The players will essentially control how many total sounds they want to hear at a time... If you have a PII 400 and a soundcard that accelerates DirectSound and DirectSound3D, you can crank it all up and hear every possible sound the designers put in the game. If your machine is lower-end, lower the number of sounds down. We'll probably default to something like 5 3D sounds and 3 2D sounds for the minimum spec machine.<br><br>

<B>5.3.4 <U>Are there plans to support Redbook Audio, MIDI, or DirectMusic?</U></B><BR><BR>

No.<BR><BR>

<B>5.3.5 <U>Will Ascension have some of the older Ultima tunes for nostalgia?</U></B><BR><BR>

Yes, some old tunes will be in Ascension.<BR><BR>

<B>5.3.6 <U>Will the musical tracks be dynamic and play differently depending on the situation (fade in, fade out, overlap of different tracks)?</U></B><BR><BR>

We plan to support dynamic music.<BR><BR>

<B>5.4. <U>System Requirements</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>5.4.1 <U>What will be the minimum requirements to run Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

At this point in time, the minimum requirement that Origin is shooting for is a Pentium 200 with 32 megs of RAM, with a 3D accelerator being highly recommended.<BR><BR>

<B>5.4.1.1 <U>Will the game actually run on the minimum machine?</U></B><BR><BR>

Bill Randolph says, (paraphrased) that the minimum platform will probably not run at the target frames per second for the game, but that we are scaling it so it will be "playable" (which he personally describes at about 15-18fps). We're trying to make our minimum not such a bogus number, because we play games too and we hate it when the min is a lie. The recommended system is meant to be able to hit the target frame rate reliably throughout the game. The game will run on other machines, of less than the rec or required stats, but what's "playable" becomes more relative. You might think 8fps is "playable". In terms of what will have to be sacrificed.. with hardware acceleration, you will see pretty much what's in the screenshots. The ancilliary items, like bushes and twigs, etc, will be reduced on a lower end system, but the characters themselves don't change. The other major thing is the clipping plane... lower end systems will have to be played with the clipping plane brought much closer in.<BR><BR>

<B>5.4.2 <U>What are the recommended system requirements to run Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

At this point in time, the recommended machine looks to be a Pentium 2 233 with 64 Mb RAM and 3D video acceleration.<BR><BR>

<B>5.5 <U>Miscellaneous Technical Questions</U></B><br><br>

<B>5.5.1 <U>How big will Ascension be?</U></B><BR><BR>

In  terms  of  disk space, Ascension will  most  likely take up two CD-ROMs (something in excess of 1.2 Gigabytes).<BR><BR>

<B>5.5.2 <U>How much hard disk space will Ascension's installation take up?</U></B><BR><BR>

It shouldn't be more than 400-500mb for the install.  Fully installing the CD's onto your HD won't increase your performance.<BR><BR>

<B>5.5.3 <U>Will there be a floppy version?</U></B><BR><BR>

No. As with all Origin products, Ascension will be released on CD-ROM only.<BR><BR>

<B>5.5.4 <U>Will there be a DVD version of Ascension?</U></B><BR><BR>

"The idea hasn't been discussed, but it makes a hell of a lot of sense." -Lord British<BR><BR>

<B>5.5.5 <U>Will Ascension have support for VR helmets and goggles?</U></B><BR><BR>

No comment.<BR><BR>
