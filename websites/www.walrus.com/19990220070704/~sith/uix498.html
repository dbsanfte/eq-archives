<U>22 April 1998</U><BR><BR>

This interview with Dan Reubenfield is from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.scorched.com" TARGET="_parent">Ultima.Scorched.Com</A>:<BR><BR>

<B>Ultima @ Scorched</B>: Why did you decide to leave Origin?<BR><BR>

<B>Dan Rubenfield</B>: I left Origin for a number of reasons. First and foremost there were a number of creative differences over what the future of the Ultima property should be. Also, there were some issues that occurred during our management transition that we had during January. Overall, I felt that my long term career goals could not be met at that company.<BR><BR>

<B>U@S</B>: How much work had you completed on Ultima 9?<BR><BR>

<B>DR</B>: I was on Ultima 9 for about a year, and had originally been working on the magic system with Bob White (Lead Designer of Ultima IX). There was about a 9 month period where i was transferred to Ultima Online, and when work resumed, I was put in charge of constructing a number of towns and dungeons, as well as writing numerous design documents for the rest of the team.<BR><BR>

<B>U@S</B>: Did the reason you quit have anything to do with the reported removal of roleplaying elements from Ultima 9, to focus on more visual elements?<BR><BR>

<B>DR</B>: I think that Ultima IX has lost sight of what the Ultima Series means to both gamers, and the industry as a whole. It was such an important series to so many people both inside and outside of the industry. It transcends things like "properties" and the like, because it changed so many peoples' lives, but instead of respecting and following that tradition, Ultima IX seems more concerned with cranking out the big dollars and alienating the people that made the property what it is today. I understand the need of a company to make money, and I understand the diversification of sales in the industry (top 10 making most of the cash), but I think that if Ultima IX was true to its heritage, and delivered a play experience on par with 4, 5, 6 or even 7, gamers would flock to it.<BR><BR>

<B>U@S</B>: What were you and Marshall Andrews responsible for in Ultima Online?<BR><BR>

<B>DR</B>: Marshall and I were responsible for everything from the construction of wilderness areas, to the wonderfully gory "trophy system".<BR><BR>

<B>U@S</B>: When will we find out where you have gone and what you will be working on?<BR><BR>

<B>DR</B>: Both myself and Marshall are going to Ion Storm South, to work with the world renowned Warren Spector (HI WARREN!). (ed. note: Spector worked on Ultima Underworlds 1 and 2, System Shock, Ultima 6, Wings of Glory, and others) We are going to be working on the game formally known as Shooter, now known as Deus Ex. And yes that is the complete name, if you don't know how pronounce it, well.. erm.. READ A BOOK!<BR><BR>

<B>U@S</B>: That's a lot of Origin employees in one place. Did Ion Storm "poach" you?<BR><BR>

<B>DR</B>: No.. In fact, we sought out Warren, of our own volition. We felt that Ion Storm South offered greater opportunities, and a great work environment. I feel privileged to be allowed to work with the development team down there. <BR><BR>

<B>U@S</B>: A lot of people have accused Origin of losing their touch, especially regarding Ultima. Do you agree?<BR><BR>

<B>DR</B>: I think that origin is very concerned with the bottom line, which is perfectly understandable, considering that they are a business. But i think that commercially viable products can be delivered without compromising the longest running computer game series's true meaning.<BR><BR>

<B>U@S</B>: When you left, were things on track for a demo of U9 at E3?<BR><BR>

<B>DR</B>: The demo of Ultima IX was coming along very smoothly, under the tutelage of Seth Mendelsohn.<BR><BR>

<B>U@S</B>: Is there anything else you would like to say?<BR><BR>

<B>DR</B>: I wish the Ultima IX team the best of luck in their future ventures, as well as the rest of Origin.<BR><BR>

Thanks, Chris!<BR><BR>

According to <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.scorched.com" TARGET="_parent">Ultima.Scorched.Com</A>, both Dan Rubenfield and Marshall Andrews have departed Origin and the U:A design team, leaving only Bob White and Seth Mendelsohn to complete the design process with Lord British and Ed Del Castillo.  Bob White provided confirmation of their leaving the team.<BR><BR>

<U>16 April 1998</U><br><br>

According to the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.h3dmedia.com/" TARGET="_parent">H3D Media webpage</A>, U:A will definitely be supporting the H3D headset.  However, they also list the game as being released in the second quarter of this year so their information might not be completely reliable.<br><br>

Thanks, Novaland!<br><br>

I just want everyone to know that yesterday's item was from me, and not from Bob.  I was hoping to save myself some e-mails explaining why I wasn't updating as much as I was when Origin was still talking, and also to let folks know what was on the U:A horizon.<br><br>

Just so everyone knows, all quotes from Bob (or another credible source) are set off and italicized.<br><br>

<U>13 April 1998</U><br><br>

Just so everyone knows, I'm still here and haven't gone on strike, vacatation, or went to work for Origin.  News on the U:A front is in a holding pattern until the E3 show at the end of May, where U:A will be shown to the public for the first time.  The U:A demo that Origin is putting together for E3, according to Bob White's last public statement, should be available for download or come on a magazine's CD-Rom sometime around the same time as the convention.<br><br>
