<U>30 November 1998</U><br><br>

Lord British stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> today:<br><br>

Here's what he had to say about whether or not the classic roman numerals will return in the game's title:<br><br>

<i>In Origin, as most companies, there is a separation between development and marketing. In the past, I have wavered on my position of having the IX or not. At this point, I am clearly in favor of putting the IX back in. However, even I must convince the publishing group. In companies everyone has there job, and marketing gets the final call here. I am however a very persuasive person... We'll see!</i><br><br> 

And here's what he had to say about what would be the best control interface for the game -- mouse, keyboard, joystick, gamepad, etc.:<br><br>

<i>Mouse.  Keys can all be reassigned, though.</i><br><br>

And here's what he had to say about how he plotted past Ultimas, and about the future of the series:<br><br>

<i>The first 3 Ultima's I did not even know there would be a next and their plots have been forced together later. On the second trilogy, I at least started off with where the last one ended. With U7-9 I did at least plan a few of the basics around the Guardian, the main goals and where the game would take place, not much more. And for Ultima's beyond IX, only a short wish list of technical issues I'd like to see us accomplish, nothing yet about the plot.</i><br><br>

<U>25 November 1998</U><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to explain why things have been quiet there lately -- too quiet:<br><br>

<i>Let me take a moment to just say the team is really working hard.  We've had a couple of internal deadlines come around, and several members of the team spent weekend after long weekend here at the office working to meet our goals.  As a result, some have taken a couple of days off to recover, and since it's Thanksgiving, some are spending quality time with their families.<br><br>

The team enjoys answering your questions and is committed to doing so.. but not at the cost of their sanity. ;)  So, please remain patient with us.  A week for you between questions being answered and a week for us can feel
*extremely* different .<br><br> 

Thanks for keeping your questions coming... we will endeavor to answer them in as timely a fashion as possible.</i><br><br>

<U>24 November 1998</U><br><br>

It's been quiet on the news front lately, but <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.gamespot.com" TARGET="_parent">Gamespot</A> just put up a preview of U:A.  The preview also includes one screenshot of a group of Gargoyles, and a backpack screenshot showing what looks to be spell icons and the health and mana meters.<br><br>

Thanks, <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.gamespot.com" TARGET="_parent">Gamespot</A>!  And thanks to everyone who sent a heads-up my way!<br><br>

<U>19 November 1998</U><br><br>

Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to talk about what we can expect to see in future revisions of the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.ultima-ascension.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A website</A>:<br><br>

<i>For the new Ascension site, we're planning a whole heck of a lot more content.  A bestiary is among the plans.  What's nice about that, is that it allows people who are interested in those kinds of things a chance to view them prior to purchasing the game.. but if you are the type who likes to discover them for yourself, then you still get to.  You just avoid those web pages.  (If you are strong willed anyway. :)<br><br>

Hope that helps... start looking for the new site in a couple of months.  (I think. :)</i><br><br>

<U>16 November 1998</U><br><br>

Lord British stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> over the weekend and rolled up his sleeves:<br><br>

Lord British on the subject of whether or not a multiplayer party (a la Baldur's Gate) might be possible for U:A:<br><br>

<i>In the future a Multiplayer party adventure would be a cool thing! But in this release of Ultima IX ascension, no.</i><br><br>

And here Lord British tackles a wide number of questions that have popped up:<br><br>

<i>Wow, some good stuff in here!  Let see, how can I respond to some of these?...<br><br>

Most mentioned was the party, I hear the wish, but we cannot meet thy desires. Nor do I think it would be the right thing to do at this time. We'll see.<br><br>

Next most asked seemed to be audio. We do have excellent surround audio. World noises and creature sounds are 3D positioned around you and even enclosed spaces echo correctly. Is is cool. I'm sure you'll like it.<br><br>

Their was a question posed about does immersive equal fun. To which I say, no. Immersive is a tool to make the experience feel as real as possible. I want to believe it is really happening. If you just want to play a game, their are plenty of those out too. Immersive does not preclude fun factor, but does present certain challenges. That's our job.<br><br>

Replay... Boy I hear that one from my bosses every day. But I do not have a great answer. We are creating a well crafted experience, we do not have a plan for add ins, downloads, mission disks, level editors or post winning levels at this time. After we ship, we'll rethink this again, but right now,
we just want to finish this solo player masterpiece. We think that's enough of a challenge.</i><br><br>

And here Lord British brings to a close the debate over whether or not the decision to not include a female Avatar was the result of sexism:<br><br>

<i>Let me lay this debate to rest. As the perpetrator of said discrimination or strategy, let me tell you which it is. Neither! It's purely practicality. I would much rather give the option and have the whole game configure itself based on gender preference and even your gender preference for a mate.
Early on in U9 that's the way we had it. However, once we decided that we wanted to have pre-rendered movie segments. Then we had to decide to either never show the Avatar, render two of ever scene that had the Avatar, allow only male Avatars or even if you were a female in the game, the flics
showed males. The never show didn't make for the artistic style we wanted, the double render was more than we could afford, so we have chosen male only Avatars. The fact that only a few % of Ultima players are female (known by UO
account registrations) did help us decide on this path. But we will always provide female options when feasible.<br><br>
 
So, please don't interpret the answer in too deep a fashion, we are just trying to get a game out.</i><br><br>

Cynthe, from the U:A design team, briefly stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to address the issue of ttransparency<br><br>

<i>Yes, the water will be ttransparentin the waterfalls, oceans, etc.  A few revisions are being made to the transparency system, but we will certainly post some water screenshots soon! You should see some of the gorgeous waterfall areas our artists have created...:)</i><br><br>

<U>15 November 1998</U><br><br>

Seth, from the U:A design team, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to answer some questions:<br><br>

Here's Seth on the issue of tying up loose ends, and the possibility of add-ons:<br><br>

<I>By all means, people should make a Compendium of loose ends.  We can't guarantee  that we will add everything into the game, but we will look through, and see if we can add things from it.<br><br>

It's hard to think about add ons when we are still finishing the game.  Of course, the more support / sales the game has, the better the chance of add ons becoming a reality.  It too early to tell what's next.
</I><br><br>

And here's Seth on whether or not U:A will support that mouse wheel doohickey:<br><br>

<I>I have one of those new mice with a wheel in the center, and I like it quite a bit.  It would be great to support the wheel in some way, although I'm not exactly sure how we would want to use it.  I'll keep you informed on what happens.</I><br><br>  

<U>13 November 1998</U><br><br>

Seth, from the U:A design team, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to take a crack at answering some questions:<br><br>

Here he is on just what scripting language the team is using in the game:<br><br>

<i>The system we are using is home made, and allows the designers to have control of the NPC's / Monsters without having to do any C++ or Java experience.  On the other had, we also have the ability to have the programming department hard code anything else we might come up with.  We are lucky to have such a powerful system at our disposal.</i><br><br>

And here's Seth's take on the future of the Ultima series:<br><br>

<i>What will happen next?  We ask this question all the time.  Right now, our team's goal is to finish Ascension.  LB productions has several teams, and when the time is right, our next titles will be announced.  Will there be an Ultima
X, XI, and XII?  We can't say right now, but Ultima has been the longest running series of RPG's, and I'll be it will stay that way for a long time to come.</i><br><br>
 
And here's Seth on the issue of U:A's QA playtesting, which is of sudden importance to me following my recent purchase of both Fallout 2 and Sin:<br><br>
 
<i>Very good question.  The easy answer is that it will be in test until no bugs remain.  In reality, we have a 4 month test cycle planned, and that will get larger or smaller depending  on how things go.  We are about to start initial testing with a small group, and will add people as we get closer to ship.<br><br>  

This is our plan for now.  As we get closer to shipping, we will have a better idea.</i><br><br>  

And here's Seth's take on the amount of humor in the game:<br><br>  
 
<i>The story of Ascension is serious, although there will be characters, and events that are humorous.  We feel we have a good mix, that will not get in the way of the game, just add to the experience.<br><br>

The script written by Kim is amazing, and I'm sure everyone will see the depth she has brought to the story and characters.<br><br>  

Rest assured, Ascension is not a comedy.</i><br><br>

<U>12 November 1998</U><br><br>

Yos and Seth, both from the U:A team, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to address a couple questions that have been raised:<br><br>

Here's Yos on if U:A uses AI or scripting for creature and NPC behavior:<br><br>

<i>We use both AI and scripting to create creature and NPC behavior in our game. Most creatures and NPC's have specific AI based on certain needs or percived threats (i.e. mice will go after cheese and monsters will automatically attack creatures that are unlike themselves), but we have a very powerful scripting system that allows us to give specific characters and creatures specific behaviors and actions.  So, when you play Ascension, you will encounter creatures that are operating on basic motivations and you will encounter tightly scripted scenarios where creatures have unique actions.</i><br><br>
 
Here's Seth on whether or not torches and shields will be shown being held in the Avatar's hand, on how torches will act, and if we'll be able to use any item as a weapon:<br><br>
 
<i>Our present plan is to have shields and torches shown in the Avatar's hands.  We are still working on this, so exactly how this will work is not known.  Unlit torches will act the same as lit torches.</i><br><br>

<i>Using items (other then weapons) as weapons, is something we are discussing.</i><br><br>

Here's Seth on the question of preordering the game from Origin:<br><br>

<i>There seems to be a lot of interest in doing a preorder.  This is more of a Sales & Marketing issue, but we will be sure to let them know we think it's a great idea.  We should have more info on this in the next month or so.</i><br><br>

And here's Seth giving the final word (for now) on the issue of combat in U:A:<br><br>

<i>Combat is something that is being worked on as we speak.  I don't want to get into it until we are finished.  I will say that combat is in real time, although it will be more strategic, then arcade.  We are working hard to make combat exciting for all types of players.<br><br>

Check back in a month or so, and we will have more details on combat.</i><br><br>

<U>11 November 1998</U><br><br>

Seth, from the U:A design team, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to address a couple topics:<br><br>

Here's Seth on whether or not we'll have the option for turn-based combat:<br><br>

<i>Although multiple modes of combat would be a cool idea, Ultima Ascension is a real time combat game, and  we have no plans to add turn based combat.</i><br><br>

Here's Seth on whether or not NPCs will have different body types of if they'll be cookie-cutter models:<br><br>
 
<i>We have over 100 unique looking faces / body types, and all of the main characters will not be used again (Avatar, Lord British, Iolo, ect...).  We will make changes to the others as time permits.</i><br><br>

Here's Seth on whether or not immoral acts will count against the Avatar:<br><br>

<i>Stealing = Bad<br><br> 

Yes, the Avatar will be able to steal, but it will have an adverse effect, even if no one sees.<br><br>

I don't want to get into what happens when you do bad deeds right now, although it will have an effect on the game.</i><br><br>

Here's Seth on the subject of having to swap CD's during the game:<br><br>

<i>At this time we do not know when the CD changes will take place.  We will do our best to make the switches as convenient as possible.</i><br><br>

Finally, here's Seth on whether or not Britannia is being put together in such a way as to reward folks who want to stray from the plot for awhile:<br><br>
  
<i>Not to worry, although Ascension has a story driven plot, the player will have plenty of areas to explore.  We are working hard to maximize the world with lots of cool areas to adventure through, and many non plot related quests.</i><br><br>

<U>9 November 1998</U><br><br>

The ninth, and final, part of Desslock's interview with Lord British has just been published on <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://desslock.gamespot.com" TARGET="_parent">Desslock's Gamespot Domain</A>.  In this installment Lord British addresses FANS.txt, the departure of U:A team members, and the lasting (and positive) impact Ed Del Castillo's tenure had on the game.<br><br>

U:A team member Jaccl stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">offical U:A discussion boards</A> this afternoon:<br><br>

Jaccl on the subject of whether or not there will be an OpenGL version of U:A:<br><br>

<i>There are no plans for an OpenGL version of Ascension.</i><br><br>

Jaccl on whether or not we'll see a Linux version of U:A, and the OS's U:A is being developed on:<br><br>

<i>There are no plans for a Linux version of Ascension.<br><br>

There are team members developing under Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0. The choice of OS is based on personal preference and/or capabilities required (for example DirectX-6 for the D3D version.)</i><br><br>

I missed a couple of Seth's posts on my first run through the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A>:<br><br>

Here's Seth on the game's NPC population:<br><br>

<i>Currently the world has over 175 NPC's who all have unique conversations.  We are still adding more people to the world, and may have as many as 200-250.  This does include guards, although unlike older Ultimas, most of the guards are not generic, all saying the same thing.<br><br>  

The cities will be full of people, some with more then others.</i><br><br>

And here's Seth on whether or not the old test image of the Avatar (with brown hair) will be used in the game:<br><br> 

<i>That's a neat suggestion, especially if we were planning to have an Anti Avatar.  Presently we have no plans to use that image, although you never know.</i><br><br>

Seth stopped on by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> over the weekend to discuss a number of issues.  The one question left unanswered, however, is whether or not the cells Lord British keeps them in has internet access or if they have to use up precious showering time to post:<br><br>

Seth on the issue of why the Avatar will not say the name the player has given to him:<br><br>

<i>Although it might be possible to make the computer say your name, it would not sound like the actors we are using for all the speech.  I t would seen strange to hear am NPC talk in one voice, and say your name in another.  As has been said before, the player will be referred to as Avatar.</i><br><br>  

Seth on the question of ridable mounts and dragons:<br><br>

<i>Although it would be cool to ride horses, dragons, or other creatures, they are not part of the design plan.  There will be other forms of transportation, such as ships, and moongates.<br><br>  

The information about taming dragons is not correct.  They will not be tamable.</i><br><br>

Seth on the progess in finding and recording the game's voice talent:<br><br>

<i>We believe we have found the correct actor to play the Avatar.  We went through many many hours of auditions for the casting of UA, and we still have more to do.  Finding actors to play the 175+ characters in the game is indeed a huge task, and the Origin Audio Department is working hard to make everything sound great.<br><br>

It will be a few more weeks until we have a final cast list.</i><br><br>

Seth on whether or not the runic alphabet will be used in the game:<br><br>

<i>Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Runic will be part of the game!  I won't give away how, or when it's used, but not to worry, it will be an essential part of the game.</i><br><br>

Seth on whether or not Stones will be in the game and a soundtrack CD:<br><br>

<i>Yes Stones will be in the game.  We are looking into who will sing it.  At some point in the game, the Avatar may even have to play it...<br><br>

As for a soundtrack CD, if there is enough interest from the fans, this could happen.</i><br><br>

<U>6 November 1998</U><br><br>

Parts Seven and Eight of Desslock's Interview with Lord British were just published on <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://desslock.gamespot.com" TARGET="_parent">Desslock's Gamespot Domain</A>, including two new screenshots from the game.  I'm not going to steal any of Desslock's thunder, but if you think these screenshots are good let me say that the interview is even better:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/ua01.jpg"><IMG SRC="ua01.gif"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/ua02.jpg"><IMG SRC="ua02.gif"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

While it doesn't really touch on U:A in many places, the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.ultima-ascension.com" TARGET="_parent">official Ultima: Ascension website</A> has just put up the latest Words From Lord British.<BR><BR>

Playing hooky from work, U:A team member Jaccl stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to address the topic of specular highlighting:<br><br>

<i>At the time the Moonglow screenshot was taken there was no specular highlighting. It has since been added.</i><br><br>

As usual, the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> are a daily trove of information:<br><br>

Here's U:A team member Jaccl on whether or not the game will run under NT 4.0:<br><br>

<i>The current engine runs under NT 4.0 but that may not remain true much longer..<br><br>

Will keep you posted.</i><br><br>
 
Here's U:A team member Yos on why the Avatar is called "Avatar," and not called by the name the player gives him:<br><br>

<i>Although a personalized name is pretty cool - within the context of the game, we think that being called "Avatar" is perfect.  In the game, you are The
Avatar - which is both a personae and a title.  We think that the status of the title is akin to that of our President.  We don't call our President "Bill, the President" - we call him "Mr. President".  I hope that makes some sense.</i><br><br>
 
Here's Seth on the important issue of whether or not we can play as a crossdressing Avatar:<br><br>

<i>The Avatar will not be able to dress as a woman.</i><br><br>

While not U:A news in the strictest sense, both Marshall Andrews and Bob White have posted on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.vaultnetwork.com" TARGET="_parent">Vault Network</A> their reactions to the latest installment of <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://desslock.gamespot.com" TARGET="_parent">Desslock's interview with Lord British</A>.<br><br>

<U>5 November 1998</U><br><br>

Bill Randolph, U:A's lead programmer, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> for a couple of minutes:<br><br>

Here's Bill on the question of system requirements:<br><br>

<i>I'll try to answer this as best as I can.  First, a P233 should run the game fine, if you have enough RAM and a fast 3D accelerator.  "Enough RAM" means 64MB recommended, but 32MB will probably be playable with some pauses.  We've found that the more RAM, the better, so 128MB systems actually play faster than 64MB systems.<br><br>

Exactly which models constitute a "fast enough" 3D accelerator has yet to be determined--our Direct3D support isn't far enough along for us to be able to tell yet.</i><br><br>

Here's Bill on Voodoo Rush support, and whether or not an AWE32 will be up to snuff in the sound card department:<br><br>

<i>Voodoo Rush will be supported.<br><br>

Sound on the Awe32 should sound Awesome!  (Pardon the pun!)</i><br><br>

Here's Bill on if conversations are scripted, whether or not we lose control of the Avatar while he's speaking, and if it would be possible to save scripted sequences for reviewing:<br><br>

<i>1: Yes, conversations operate much like scripted sequences, although you choose what the Avatar's responses are.  The characters perform some physical acting along with the voice acting.<br><br>

2: While the Avatar is speaking, you won't be able to necessarily control him--however, these situations won't last long, duration-wise.<br><br>

3: We were planning too, but cut it because of time constraints.</i><br><br>

<U>4 November 1998</U><br><br>

Parts Five and Six of Desslock's nine-part interview with Lord British are now up on <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://desslock.gamespot.com" TARGET="_parent">Desslock's Gamespot Domain</A>.<br><br>

In this installment of the interview, Lord British touches on combat, magic, and the Avatar's new best friend.  Definitely worth the time to stop on by!<br><br>

SirPerky, one of the U:A team members, stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to address the issue of whether or not the Avatar will have full speech in the game:<br><br>

<i>Here's the word on the Avatar's speech.<br><br>

There will be full speech for the Avatar's lines (who the voice actor is will be discussed at a later date).  The Avatar will be able to choose from several responses in any given conversation.</i><br><br>

The <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A Discussion Boards</A> are becoming a regular haunt for the U:A team:<br><br>

Here's Seth on the issue of slotted containers versus volume containers in U:A:<br><br>

<i>Some objects have volume, like a dresser, or wooden crate. In these cases the items will be inside and no gump will appear.  A few objects have slots.  This includes the Avatar's backpack, and chests.  Gumps only appear when an
object has slots.</i><br><br>

And here's Seth on the text and speech options that will be available in the game:<br><br>
 
<i>The player will have the following options:<br><br>
Speech On / Text On<br><br>
Speech On / Text Off<br><br>
Speech Off / Text On</i><br><br>

<U>3 November 1998</U><br><br>

Capn Bill, lead programmer on U:A, projected himself onto the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A Discussion Boards</A> to speak through the mouth of Lady Moi:<br><br>

Bill Randolph on riding mounts:<br><br>

<i>We COULD do mounted creatures, if we wanted to.  Our new animation system could do it, one way or another.  But, the design doesn't really require it, so we're avoid implementing any technology that isn't really needed by the design.<br><br>

I know of no plans for balloons or magic carpets--only the Avatar's feet and the ship.</i><br><br>

After a brief lull on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A Discussion Boards</A>, things have started to hop again:<br><br>

Here's what Lord British had to say on whether or not there will be a virtual ecology in U:A:<br><br>

<i>UO did have one. I loved the idea. I told everyone about it. It sounded so cool. It was incredibly hard to make work at all. No one even noticed or cared much when it did work. We took it out.<br><br>

There will not be a virtual ecology in U:A.<br><br>

Nuff said? ;)</i><br><br>

Here's Seth answering a barrage of questions on the magic system:<br><br> 
   
<i>1. You will use the cursor to aim at your target.  Facing the target will be unnecessary.<br><br>

2. Area spells will effect the area, centering from the cursor.<br><br>

3.  Yes, there will be magic fields<br><br>

4.  Yes, some attacks will work over a crystal barrier<br><br>

5.  Some characters will dance... <br><br>

6.  No pickpocket spell<br><br>

7.  You will be able to summon creatures...no, they won't guard your house<br><br>

8.  Shrink....you will have to wait!!!</i><br><br>
 
And Seth on the subject of keys in U:A, and a handful of other topics:<br><br>

<i>Let's go over keys...When you use a key, it goes away, never to be used again. The door that the key is used on will now be unlocked forever.  There will be no keyring.<br><br>

Other questions...<br><br>

Weapons equipped on the Avatar will shown on his body.  This includes weapons and shields.<br><br>

Gold and arrows will not take up slots. Slots will only hold items.  Pouches will not fit into slots.</i><br><br>

And here's Lady Moi, talking about the game's camera:<br><br>

<i>Currently, the camera is fully mobile.  You can tell from screenshots that we can move the camera around.  However, it is the opinion of some (Seth, the lead designer, included) that the game is less playable in certain camera views. Navigation through the world (narrow passes, steep ridges, etc) is very difficult in first person.  It's my guess that people who are used to playing in that perspective may have an easier time of it.. in fact may quite enjoy it... but those that aren't will have a more difficult time of it.  Of
course, that's just my opinion.<br><br>

As for zooming in and out.. currently, it's all possible.</i><br><br>

Parts Three and Four of Desslock's nine-part interview with Lord British is now available on <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://desslock.gamespot.com" TARGET="_parent">Desslock's Gamespot Domain</A>.  Definitely worth a read, not to mention a few banner clicks.<br><br><br>
