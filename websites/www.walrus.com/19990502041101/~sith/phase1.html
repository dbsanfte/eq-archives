<BR><BR>
<U>22 June 1997</U><BR><BR>

The last day of Phase One initially seemed to go very well for me, with my character actually surviving through the night.  One of the main annoyances of the last days of the tests were the near-nightly character "sweeps", which deleted all the characters and left everyone back at square one.  According to a GM I ran into, this was to keep anyone from become super powerful during the E3 show and really upsetting the balance of gameplay.  I can see their point, but it was annoying.<BR><BR>

The morning was spent building up my swordsmanship skill, and then I decided I would go visit the only "real" dungeon I could find -- a multi-level cavern system to the northeast of Britain.  Going in with a Swordsmanship of 81%, I felt I had a pretty good chance of surviving.  Immediately inside the entrance was a nest of red dragons and their drakes, and I sprinted past and down a staircase leading deeper into the mountain.  When I reached the bottom, a vast cavern opened up filled with more monsters than I had previously seen, arranged into camps that took up different sections of the cave.  Charging toward the nearest Ratman, I was shocked when I killed him with a single blow from my knife.  Checking my skills list, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my swordsmanship skill skyrocketed to 2100%, and my parrying skill was a dizzying 7150%.<BR><BR>

Soon I was mowing through armies of Ratmen, Headless Ones, Lizard Men, and Giant Scorpions.  After the first cavern was clear, I decided to start picking over the bodies of the dead for whatever goodies I could find when I ran into what may very well be the single <U>worst</U>, <U>most sinister</U>, and downright <U>evil</U> bug I have ever found in Ultima Online -- the container bug.  Basically, the container bug causes the client to crash whenever you open the inventory of dead monster, and it seemed particularly bad in dungeons.  Spread out before me was the largest pile of riches I had seen to date in Ultima Online -- full suits of plate mail, more swords than I could count, sacks and sacks of gold, and none of it could I pick up without risking a crash.  The worst thing about the container bug is that it's impossible to tell when it will strike -- sometimes you can loot the bodies of the dead safely, sometimes you can't, and sometimes you can't even look into your own inventory without it crashing.  Patiently, though, I searched through the bodies, reloaded the client more than I would care to remember, and eventually ended up so well equiped that I couldn't think of anything else that I would want.  I had piles of swords and axes, magic wands and crystal balls from a group of liches, a spell book from a drake and when I finally got tired of stomping around underground, I climbed back up to the entrance, killed the dragons that were there and marched toward the cave door.  Then nothing. <BR><BR>

I walked away from the entrance, and then back to it, but I could not leave.  I logged out, and then logged back in, but the exit still would not work.  As I stood there and tried to figure out a workaround to this obvious bug, a group of adventurers climbed up the staircase and one of them chuckled about my being trapped in there with them.  One of them admitted that they had been trapped since Saturday afternoon, and that there was no other way out.  Consigned to my fate, I joined with the others as we descended the staircase and pushed deeper and deeper into the lower reaches of the dungeon, leaving armies of monsters dead in our wake in a bizarre sort of inescapable Valhalla.  About two hours into our underground rampage, everything just stopped as the servers seemed to go down for what must have been the last time during Phase One because I haven't been able to log in since.<BR><BR>

Since Phase One of the Beta Test now seems to be over, I can honestly say that I am <U>astonished</U> by Ultima Online, even in its Beta state.  Origin really has pushed the envelope of online gaming lightyears beyond what we've seen so far.  My Britannia was a living world the likes of which I have not experienced in the decade since I last played AD&D -- there was not a single element that seemed out of place:  the chirping of the birds, the splashing of waterfalls, the mournful whistle of the wind through the mountain passes, the lonely ruins overgrown from years of abandon, the unexpected meetings far from civilization (and from help), all added to give me the single greatest roleplaying experience that I have ever had on a computer.  Lord British isn't only the ruler of Britannia, he's also one hell of a DM.<BR><BR>


<U>17 June 1997</U><BR><BR>

It's clear that Origin is putting a <EM>lot</EM> of effort into making Ultima Online as stable and bug-free as possible.  In the six hours or so I played this evening the version number incremented four times, and I can't even tell you the number of minor code revisions that were implimented.  Origin has included a system by which the client will download and install the latest code revisions on the fly while you're playing, and it's nice to see that a lot of the player bug reports are being fixed.  The servers were very stable, and only seemed to go down once while I was playing.<BR><BR>

Tonight I decided that I would go exploring, and since everyone else seemed to be heading toward Yew or Trinsic I felt I would head east.  Before I go any farther, let me tell you that Ultima Online is big.  Very, very big.  So big, in fact, that the idea of a guild or other group of people actually being able to control *any* part of Britannia is quite laughable once you see how big a place it is.  In fact, it took me three hours (yes, real-time hours) to go from the eastern edge of Britain to Vesper.  Mind you, I wasn't lagged either -- I was going along at a good clip and although I got lost a couple of times I went in as straight a line as possible.<BR><BR>

At this point in the game PC equipment is still hard to come by, and I count myself very fortunate to have a longsword and shield -- no armor though.  Combat is very similar to how it was implimented in the pre-Alpha tests -- basically you enter into "war" status and then double-click on what you want to kill.  If you're lucky you'll kill whatever it is before it gets a chance to run away, if you're not let me tell you monsters and NPCs can run very, very fast when they're scared.  Luckily, increasing your combat skills does not require a kill.<BR><BR>

In my travels last night, I saw a number of things that were so nifty or so well done that I'm going to suggest you watch out for them:<BR><BR>
<LI>There's a strip mine just a bit east of Minoc that has a couple of small dungeons/caves in it.<BR><BR>
<LI>The yew trees in the forest surrounding Yew are very well done, imho.  They're very big, too, and easily fill up a third of the view.<BR><BR>
<LI>The deserts in the far east near Vesper have what appears to be a shifting pattern of dunes, even though there's no real indication in the game of winds.<BR><BR>
<LI>I was exploring a narrow mountain pass in the far northeast that took me high into the mountain range.  It was extra twisty, and I feared getting lost when all of a sudden it began to snow.  It didn't collect on the ground, but it did seem to snow more and more heavily the higher I climbed into the mountain range.  It may not seem like a big deal, but it was very cool.<BR><BR>
<LI>I was wandering through a very large area of open plains when I spied a horse standing still and munching grass.  I looked around to see if someone was nearby, and when I figured there wasn't I moved closer.  I double-clicked on the horse and it trotted off the screen.  I chased, and double-clicked again when I caught up to it.  This time it ran a shorter distance away.  Chased and double-clicked a third time and it trotted away a few steps.  The fourth time it let me mount, and I had a horse.<BR><BR>

Another area where Ultima Online is really, really beginning to shine is in the monsters.  In the forested area south of Yew and west of Britain you can find a great deal of very large monsters roaming about.  The Ettin and the Giant are very well done, and easily four or five times the size of a PC.  The animations on them are very good, and if you keep your distance you can watch them do their stuff -- on one occassion it seemed as if an Ettin ripped a dead tree out of the ground to use as a club, though it might have been a glitch in the animation.  Another cool monster to watch out for is the Reaper.  I'm not going to describe it for you because of shock of getting near one in the forest is fun.<BR><BR>

I did, of course, run into some bugs.  Mostly minor, but some did send the game crashing and me back to the desktop.  Luckily, though, getting back into the game is quick and easily.  Some of my bugs and observations:<BR><BR>
<LI>Opening the inventory of a dead PC, opening your inventory, and then trying to move an item from the dead guy into your inventory will, almost always, crash you to the desktop.  IIRC, we also had this problem in the pre-Alpha tests.<BR><BR>
<LI>Monsters definitely do not respawn often enough.  It is entirely possible to walk for <EM>hours</EM> through the forests and not see a single living animal.  If the game is based on skills, we should have the opportunity to exercise those skills.<BR><BR>
<LI>Some the dead monster animations do not seem to have been implimented yet.  This seems to apply mostly to the Great Hart (a big deer), but also seems to apply to black rabbits/hares.<BR><BR>
<LI>There simply <EM>has</EM> to be some sort of map function in this game.  Everything about this game is big and it would be a great help to be able to tell approximately where you are.<BR><BR>
<LI>There are a few problems with the horse: one, the animations for combat on horseback do not seem to be fully-implimented -- they switch from normal combat to you sitting on top of the horse; two, the clip-clopping of the horse tends to get caught into a "sound loop" that will momentarily freeze the game; and three, the horse always wanders away too quickly if you dismount -- it's realistic, I know, but that's <EM>my</EM> horse damnit!
<BR><BR>
<U>16 June 1997</U><BR><BR>
The CD arrived in the mail today.  Installation was easy given Win95's autorun.  If you have the disk space, the maximum installation seems to be the only way to go.  The Max install is about 450 megs, the Common install is 250 megs, and the Minimum is 45 or so.<BR><BR>

Connecting to the UO servers automatically brings up the Autopatch Ultility -- which auto updates the client to the latest versions.  This is actually a nice feature believe it or not.<BR><BR>

After the patches install, the UO intro movie plays.  The intro is an .avi file and is played full-screen letterbox, which makes the resolution suffer greatly.  It's not impressive graphically until you play it in Win95's .avi player.  If you see the graphics as they're meant to be seen it's a very, very impressive intro.  It's been a long time since a computer game movie got me as jazzed as UO did.  I'm really, really looking forward to Ultima IX having seen what they've done with UO.<BR><BR>

After the intro, the game brings up the character creation screen.  It's nicely designed and functional, but some of the interface is buggy and the source of my first minor complaint.  It's not completely clear whether or not the servers are *really* up or down while you're creating your character -- creating your character only to find you're not able to connect to be able to save it is something of a pain.  I think a great way around this would be to include a "server up or down" message in the Autopatch dialog box to save you the trouble.<BR><BR>

Once the character's created, you enter Britannia in either Britain or Trinsic.  This is where my second complaint comes in:  you start with a pathetic, pathetic amount of equipment.  You start with clothes and rabbit knife/dagger -- watch out world.  I strongly feel that the default equipment must be made more useful if the game is supposed to be anything but daunting once you leave the city.<BR><BR>

Some people have complained about the graphics, and I have to say I don't know what the hell they're talking about.  They really are very good overall, and wonderful on occassion.  The early lag problem seems to have been solved, because I really didn't experience any except for shortly before Origin took down the server.<BR><BR>

Overall, my first day of play has left me with a *very* positive feeling on Ultima Online -- a project I was somewhat lukewarm on even after playing in both of the pre-Alpha tests.  Even though the game is unpolished at this time, it's not hard to see a real gem underneath.
