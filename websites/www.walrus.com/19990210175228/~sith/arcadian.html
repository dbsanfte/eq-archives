This is the log of the chat held with Lord British on 13 November 1996.  It has been edited slightly for readability.
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: Thanks for joining us today, Richard.
   We're very pleased to have you in Arcadium today!
 Just to get things rolling, can you tell us a bit about how your "discovered" Fantasy Role
   Playing gaming?
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Thanks!... Really, thanks for having me. Now to answer... I got into RPD's back in High school in
   1977...at the same time I found computers, and FRP books like Lord of the Rings... It was only natural that since there were no
   computer games at that time...  I spent my last three years of high school creating fantasy games on the school computer....
Then, upon graduation, I discovered Apple II's and the rest is history, or... actually still going on!  
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: And so it began....
 <BR><BR>
Q: smaug1 asks: I am editor of the UO Newsletter. I
   interviewed Starr Long. Would you like to give me an
   interview?
<BR><BR>
A: Sure, I'd love to, just contact Richard Steinberg
   here at Origin.  GA
 <BR><BR>
 Q: Thalion asks: A hearty greeting from the Nobility!
   With your time spent on other projects, how much time
   will hou have to devote to playing LB on UO? Will
   anyone else from OSI ever roleplay Lord British in
   your absence?
<BR><BR>
A: I will be the only one to play LB!!!...
<BR><BR> 
lordbrit: Of course I cannot guarantee how much time I
   will have, but... Since I enjoyed the tests so much, I hope to
   play quite a bit.  GA
<BR><BR>
Q: XmasTitan asks: Can you, Richard, tell us when we
   will see a UO FAW update or some UO related info?
   (Like a beta date? heh)
<BR><BR>
A: Unfortunately, I do not know the answer to that.  GA
 <BR><BR>
 Q: DixieDragon asks: Question from Dixie dragon of the
   League of Pirates. Mr. Garriot, do you forsee Ultima
   Online or Ultima 9 making more money overall for OSI,
   and which project is currently reciving more emphasis
   in development and design?
<BR><BR>
A: interesting question... Right now, Ultima IX is projected to sell
   more $$$, but... If Uo copntinues to grow as quickly as it
   has it could easily take over from a dollars standpoint.  GA
 <BR><BR>
Q: Tandar asks: What advice would you give to someone
   who would also like to "create worlds"?  In other
   words, how can we break into the computer gaming
   business?
<BR><BR>
A: Well, The short answer is...
 join forces with an existing high quality
 group, then... you can learn the ropes from the inside of a
successful company, only then... should you try to move up the ladder and
push to create your own vision.  GA
 <BR><BR>
Q: Thalion asks: Is online gaming the true future of
   RPG's? Will most of Origin's future RPG titles be
   multi-player?
<BR><BR>
A: I do not think so, I still think... that there is much room for solo play games.
   The kinds of experiences are quite different...
Solo play games can more easily have strong
story elements and multi player games have great NPC
AI so to speak.  GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: vicphi asks: in your msn chat you mentioned that
   ships will have cannons in UO, can you blow the ammo
   and are you expecting ships to be sinkable?
<BR><BR>
A: Not known yet.  It is not clear what we would do
   with... the passangers in that case.  Of course, we
   would want to do something... in response to being cannoned, but sinking
   has not yet been dealt with, yet.  
 <BR><BR>
Q: zayatz asks: lordbrit Is the BEta still going to
   start December or January?
<BR><BR>
A: The Beta is now in January.  GA
 <BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: Here is something I've always wanted to
   know.... Richard, what do yoiu think makes a
   good game master?
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Well... In fact good game masters are hard to find,
   and... Good game masters should be great story
   tellers, not good statisticians.... That is why I still think there is room for
   great solo play games, to the extent that there are
   great game masters.  GA
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: Thanks, Ricjard!
<BR><BR> 
Q: Selganor asks: Are there any plans for sci-fi rpg's
   in the works? ala 2400ad?
<BR><BR>
A: Yes, of course!... In fact, we already have begun planning for
   a Privateer on-line.  GA
 <BR><BR>
Q: CleanMick asks: I have heard  it said that some
   future online game might be a first person RPG. I hope
   that UOL stays as it is, since I feel that the view it
   sports is much better for a multi player RPG. Will Uol
   be staying in the classic semi top down third person
   view like I hope it will?
<BR><BR>
A: YES! I too feel third person view is far better for
   multi player gaming!.  GA
 <BR><BR>
 Q: Monar asks: Is there any info you can give us on
   Ultima Online that hasn't been covered in the FAQ's?
<BR><BR>
A: Too general a question I'm afraid.  GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: jzelenka asks: Do you (or Origin) plan to extend
   the realm of UO to other words (countries) as well? 
   This panamenian Dragon is very curious...
<BR><BR>
A: UO will be available world wide...
Additionally, we are... looking into if it is necessary to place
   servers... in other countries.... we hope not to so that we can keep all
   players in the same world.  GA
 <BR><BR>
Q: Withnail asks: Howdy! Have the Ultimas been
   influenced by the writings of Michael Moorcock? I've
   noticed some similarities.
<BR><BR>
A: I can say a resounding no.  Because I have not read
   any of his works.  in fact... I really don't read much at all, I am a
   product of the video generation, so to speak.  GA
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: Video on...
 <BR><BR>
Q: MetunusNox asks: Bioforge was a great game and has
   a powerful engine.  Do you plan to release any other
   games based on this technology?
<BR><BR>
A: Unfortunately, we have none planned right now.  GA
 <BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: Another question about UO... will at
   least portions of Ultima Online be game mastered?
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Sort of...
Though the game will mostly run itsself...
We do have people planned to be on line at
all times to support and master the game...
Starr and I will be on as Blackthorn and
Lord British....
as well as many others to keep plots moving
and intrigue high.  GA
 <BR><BR>
Q: Withnail asks: Is there any real-world
   philosophical influence in the Britanian virtues? Such
   as Buddhism?
<BR><BR>
A: Yes!  In fact Hinduism was also a big influence...
 Mostly stuff I stole from late night
   informational programs on the discovery channel and
   such.  ;}  GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: AntiochElruin asks: Is there ever going to be a
   Privateer Online?  And if so when?
<BR><BR>
A: Yes. It is likely the next thing the UO group will
   do!  GA
 <BR><BR> 
Q: DixieDragon asks: Lord British, not to bore you
   with business, but do you see these recent product
   developments raising the stock price of Origin
   signifigantly? Are any very marketable technologies on
   the horison for investors to consider in stock
   purchases?
<BR><BR>
A: Interesting question, in fact yes...
 To be specific...
Our mandate from EA was in fact not to worry
about a profit and the shear success of being ...
the first great game on the net, would raise
the stock by a few bucks...
without worrying about profit, now as it
turns out...
UO looks like it is going to do quite well,
so, we win on both counts.  GA
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: This may be included in a FAQ...but
   will UO be online 24 hours a day??? Non stop gaming???
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Yes!
<BR><BR>
Q: Raith2 asks: Are there any plans for any more
   Ultima Underworld games, or any other first person
   perspective games?
<BR><BR>
A: a qualified, yes....
In fact that is one of the largest requests
we get, but....
it is fighting for development teams
attention.  GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: Kelmvor asks: Has the price issue with Uo been
   decided yet...at least a hint :-)
<BR><BR>
A: mostly...
 We plan to sell it at retail as a normal
 product...
lmeaning you should be able to buy it for
 40-60 dollars,...
then, we plan to charge as little as we can
for on-line time...
which will be free for a month or so with a
purchase, and then...
10-25 dollars per month unlimited use.  GA
<BR><BR>
erika: This pricing model is very similar to Meridian
   59. How do you view them as competition?
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Actuall, no...
M59 is a POV, which I feel is wrong...
There is not the same level of world
interaction...
There are seperate text and game windows...
I could go on...
but suffice to say, though I am glad to see
people creating on-line worlds...
I do not see M59 as competition really.  GA
<BR><BR>
Q: Selganor asks: Lord British: Is it true that
   Electronic Arts is controlled by the Illuminati in an
   effort to monopolize and control the game industry?
<BR><BR>
A: Yes, I mean, no.  I mean I can't answer that!  GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: CarloMarx asks: I know how much you love answering
   questions about UO, but I was wondering.. when will
   the next haunted house be?
<BR><BR>
A: I don't know for sure...
 I am building a new larger castle here in
   Austin...
land I may wait for its completion to do one
 there next.  GA
<BR><BR>
Q: DunHyward asks: I have heard some pretty dastardly
   stories about cencorship on Meridian 59, and even some
   rumours of guilds being forced to close... how does
   UOL plan to deal with blaggards? A concerned warrior
   from Clan Woad
<BR><BR>
A: I guess that depends on how bad they get...
 In towns the guards will be programmed to
   cut down on anti-social behavior, but...
in the outlying areas, chaos will rule!.  GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: Agincourt asks: Lord british, i also enjoy the
   medieval time period. How many swords and things like
   that do you own?
<BR><BR>
A: a fair bit, I'd say...
 a dozen swords and a dozen crossbows, a
   couple suits of armour, and a ton of victorian
   mechanical devices.  GA
 <BR><BR>
Q: LordCie asks: what inspired you to pursue a career
   in creating worlds?
<BR><BR>
A: well actually it kinda just happened...
 I was very into game mastering, but did not
   see it as a career..
as there was no industry at the time...
Instead, I was going to school for a EE
   degree....
Fortunately, I fell into this industry
   instead.  GA
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: What other game companies have you been
   impressed with? Particularly in terms of their games,
   their people or their technology?
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Well...
Broderbund has always been a favorite...
Not only Myst, but many of there earlier
   works have been favorites...
More importantly, I like the people at
   Broderbund...
There are few quality people in business,
   and they are some!  GA
 <BR><BR>
Q: peteclark5 asks: What would you say if I told you
   that there's a new Internet 3D RPG coming out,
   allowing for true voice, 1st or 3rd person views,
   seamless server hopping, and an incredible cheap price
   to boot?
<BR><BR>
A: neat!  when can I see it?
 <BR><BR>
Q: Zeos2 asks: of the games in the Ultima series which
   would you say is the best?
A: hard to answer, but...
U4 had the coolest premise...
U5 was far better told, with better greys
   between good and evil...
U6 had the best plot twist with the
   Gargoyles...
U7 had the best world detail of
   interaction...
U8 had the best animation and detail...
And U9 will beat all of these in the ways
   that each of them were best!!!   GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: Mephisto asks: I see a major problems in monotonous
   Online RPG's.  The game seems to drone on, Kill the
   rat, sell the meat, buy the sword, kill the bear, sell
   the meat, buy the better sword ect... How Does UO plan
   to keep the game 'alive' and new?
<BR><BR>
A: Thank you for asking...
 I agree!  Most games have no heart, no
   soul...
Ultima's excell at depth and meaning, we
   would not build an Ultima world without it...
To be specific, in Ultima Online, you
   participate in a grand epic plot, that goes well
   beyond...
Kill the rat and spend your gold.....
Both LB and Blackthorn have agendas that
   players can join, beyond what people bring
   themselves...
I cannot go into it much though here!  GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: Bedwyr2 asks: What would you like Origin's
   'mission' in life to be?
<BR><BR>
A: In fact we are having meetings this week on our
   long range planning...
 I hope Origin can remain the place that
   unlike many companies who just go for the me too fast
   buck...
can remain a place that prospers by
   inovation and leading edge work, which is often not
   the easiest to make the fiscally best.  GA
<BR><BR> 
Q: MikaelKK asks: (about solo gaming) Could Origin
   consider making a game more like the old "Knights of
   Legend", or is the Ultima serie the one-way for You to
   go?
<BR><BR>
A: Depends what you mean...
 In fact, the serialized game where you get
   the game in parts is still being considered, and ...
in fact UO add ins will sort of be this
   way...
<BR><BR> 
Q: rakthar asks: The ultimas have always been very
   mature games, will U9 follow suit? Ex: U7 pt 2, there
   was nudity, and some "adult" humor - are you gearing
   U9 towards adult or more "pg" rating?
<BR><BR>
A: Well, though I am not fearful of "adult" issues...
 In U9, though the theme is dark and
   "mature"...
there is only PG stuff in there that I'm
   aware of.  GA
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: So, Richard, we gotta know...what are
   =you= playing these days? (Besides LB in UO, of
   course!  )  : >
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Well...
I play a lot of C&C and Warcraft these days.
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: Watch sales of C&C and Warcraft go
   up... : >
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: May I make some closing remarks?
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: Please!
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Well, again, let me thank you all for
   attending, its a great sign of support...
Some data points we are very proud of for UO
   are as follows...
So far we have over 40,000 people signed up
   for the Beta test, which is far more than on any other
   game we know of...
we are about to shut down the application
   process...
The sales projections have gone from 10k to
   30k to now over 110k units...
we have had to double our server space
   already...
(BTW, there is no server to server jumps, as
   someone was commenting earlier.  All seamless)...
In any case, I cannot tell you how excited
   we are about UO, and I hope to see you all there. 
   Thanks!
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron claps hands wildly for Richard...
<BR><BR>
ChrisBargeron: Thanks so much for being online withus
   today, Richard!
And to the folks here...
THANKS for making this the best event
   on Arcadium thus far.
We will be doing at least one
   Auditorium event on Arcadium week, so come back and
   see what we have planned!
There will be a transcript of this
   event posted online.
Thanks again, and see you online!
<BR><BR>
lordbrit: Fare thee well!
<BR><BR>
