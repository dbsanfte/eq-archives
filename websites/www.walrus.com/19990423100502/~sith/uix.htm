<CENTER>This long-awaited installment in the Ultima series is due to hit stores in 1999.  Following on the heels of the technically excellent but ill-received Ultima VIII: Pagan, Ascension has been years in the planning.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Set in Britannia after its capture by The Guardian, Ascension finds The Avatar locked in the final battle to free Britannia in what Lord British claims to be the final Ultima to feature The Avatar.</CENTER><BR><BR>

<U>25 January 1999</U><br><br>

<IMG SRC="new.gif">Lady Moi stopped by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to discuss when we'll see the new and revamped official U:A web page:<br><br>

<i>The new site has been pushed back.  Some initial art and look and feel work has been done, but the content is on hold.<br><br>

Tanis is correct in his description.  As far as I know at this moment, all those things will be integrated into the site.  I don't know what the timeline is right now, however.  But I suspect it's still a couple of months off. :)<br><br>  

I am trying to get some new material ready to release to you all.  It's taking longer than I expected, however.<br><br>

I'll try to keep you all updated on the progress.  :)</i><br><br>

<U>21 January 1999</U><br><br>

U:A team member Trellek took a moment to stop by the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> to talk about party pathfinding and the real reason behind the removal of the party:<br><br>

<i>We actually had party following working quite nicely, but it was decided (way back when the game was using a software rasterizer, before we went 3D) that there would be too many polygons moving on screen, which would adversely affect the appearance of combat with more than one or two opponents. The decision not to have a party had nothing to do with pathfinding. There may have been other reasons related to game design, but the technical issue was the speed of drawing
lots of moving polygons in software on machines that would be considered really slow by today's standards.<br><br>

Party members could follow you through obstacle courses without getting separated. You could even jump across a gap, and your followers would wait for you to move, then follow you by jumping to the same spot where you landed. Solutions to similar problems (climbing fences, closing doors behind you, etc.) hadn't yet been implemented at the time the decision was made to not have a party, but wouldn't have been hard to add.</i><br><br>

Here's Lady Moi discussing the art team having met their milestones (which basically means that their work on U:A is completed), bringing the game that much closer to completion:<br><br>

<i>... the art team has completed the bulk of their milestones and some of the artists have started to migrate to other projects.  I think only 2 have gone so far, with more set to follow over the next few weeks/months.</i><br><br>

Thanks, Lady Moi!<br><br>

<U>19 January 1999</U><br><br>

After a brief moment of silence, Origin returned to the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> today:<br><br>

Here's Lady Moi on the game's music and whether or not we'll see it in MIDI:<br><br>

<i>An orchestra is being used to assist in the creation of the music for the game.  There are no plans to convert those (or use midi versions of those) files.</i><br><br>

Here's Audball on how containers presently appear to the player:<br><br>

<i>Thus far, only containers that are too small to hold items in the 3D world pop up a slotted gump.  Anything that is big enough to hold real items does so in the world.  (Eg. a bag or pouch pops up a gump, but a wardrobe or large chest does not, and instead animates open to reveal the contents which you can drag out with the cursor).</i><br><br>

<i>However, keep in mind our favorite saying, "Nothing's final 'til it ships!"  ;-)</i><br><br>

<U>12 January 1999</U><br><br>

Cap'n Bill, the lead programmer on U:A, hit the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> like gangbusters today:<br><br>

Here's Bill on whether the game will support 3DNow:<br><br>

<i>We do want to support 3DNow in Ascension, and we do have a dev sys for it.  However, we have no schedule time for this task, so we're just going to have to see how our dev schedule goes to see if we can squeeze it in.</i><br><br>

And here he is on whether or not there will be footprints in the game:<br><br>

<i>Cool idea, but we have no plans to implement footprints.</i><br><br>

And here he is on the subject of CD swapping:<br><br>

<i>Currently, we have no requirement to swap CDs while playing.  It's my belief that we can fit all the required run-time data on hard disk, and the CD will contain run-time audio, movies, etc.  You won't be able to play without the CD in the drive, but you shouldn't have to swap it, unless something changes between now & release.  Of course, this makes for a larger hard drive install (500 - 650 MB).</i><br><br>

And here he is on the subject of a possible editor release:<br><br>

<i>We have no plans to release the editor with UA at this time, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is schedule considerations.  As for the older code, I believe this is still a possibility, but Lady Moi is still trying to track it all down!</i><br><br>

And here's Bill talking a bit on how arrows will behave in the game:<br><br>

<i>Arrows do "stick" in your opponent, but they fade out over time after their damage is done, making it impossible to re-use them.  Otherwise, during bow combat, an opponent with a lot of hit points would begin to resemble a porcupine--unattractive, distracting, and too many polygons.</i><br><br>

<U>11 January 1999</U><br><br>

Here's a cleaned-up version of the supposed map of U:A's Britannia, courtesy of Sergorn Dragon and Mind:<br><br>

<div align="center"><A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/u9map1.jpg"><IMG SRC="u9map1.gif"></A></div><br><br>

Thanks, guys!<br><br>

There was some activity on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> the past couple days:<br><br>

Here's Trellek, from the U:A programming team, on whether or not the player will inadvertantly be able to lose the camera during gameplay:<br><br>

<i>Yes, the camera will move in closer to the Avatar if blocked by a door closing behind you, or when you go into buildings, or anything else that might block the camera. The camera won't get left behind.</i><br><br>

<U>8 January 1999</U><br><br>

There was activity on the <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://boards.owo.com" TARGET="_parent">official U:A discussion boards</A> as Origin returns to life after the long Christmas break:<br><br>

Here's Lady MOI on the subject of the fate of the rumored Christmas present Origin was working on for the fans:<br><br>

<i>We are working on something.. unfortunately it got delayed (due to no one person, but you may blame me if you like ;)... I'm hoping to have something new and exciting within a couple of weeks to share.  :)</i><br><br>  

Here's Audball on the question of Digital versus Midi sound:<br><br>

<i>Completely depends on the source material and how much time our Audio Engineers have.  If the source audio was composed with MIDI and recorded into digital, then it wouldn't be too huge a deal to have a choice. However, I was under the impression that the music is being recorded using
live performances, which would make it difficult to provide MIDI tracks... Don't hold me to that though - I'm not the authority on the source material.</i><br><br>

Here's Trellek on whether or not terrain is affected by the clipping plane:<br><br>

<i>There is a clipping plane for the terrain (which includes mountains), but it is more distant than the clipping plane for buildings and other objects, and separately adjustable.</i><br><br>

<U>6 January 1999</U><br><br>

In the first of what I hope to be an ongoing occurrance, here's an new screenshot of a gondola in Yew, making its premiere on this site, courtesy of Lady MOI:<br><br>

<div align="center"><A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/Yew_gondola.jpg"><IMG SRC="Yew_gondola.gif"></A></div><br><br>

Thanks, Lady MOI!<br><br>

<U>5 January 1999</U><br><br>

A couple new screenshots have been released.  The first one, the map of U:A's Britannian,  has been sent to me from a number of folks (thanks!) but I don't know whom to credit as the originator:<br><br>

<div align="center"><A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/u9map.jpg"><IMG SRC="u9map.gif"></A></div><br><br>

These next two shots come from Amy Sage's <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://members.tripod.com/sageadvice/" TARGET="_parent">Sage Advice</A> homepage.  Besides being a great homepage it also lets you know more about the people behind the game since Amy is a member of the U:A design team:<br><br>
