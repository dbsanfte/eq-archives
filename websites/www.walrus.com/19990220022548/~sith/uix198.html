Here's the latest from Bob White regarding Ultima IX:<BR><BR>

1.) At what developmental stage would you say Ultima IX is currently at?<BR><BR>

<I>This is a difficult question to figure out how to phrase. Near 
completion of above ground development. Getting ready for dungeon 
implementation. Once that is done we will go back through and 
implement the interactivity in all areas (relatively straight forward 
and quick, just function calls on items). I will be working with Brian 
on the editing and preparation of the scripts for voice recording the 
NPC's which should start and end in April. After that its a couple of 
months to Alpha. A couple of months in Alpha, then Beta two months, 
then out. (Barring in major problems).</I><BR><BR>

2.) How firm is the Fall 1998 release date?<BR><BR>

<I>If I had my say it would be concrete, but the winds of change 
constantly blow through the building. Most of the team would prefer to 
get it out this fall. We feel it would be ready as it currently 
stands, but things can change (as everyone is well aware of and has 
been whipping us about).</I><BR><BR>

Here's a comment from Bob White that originally appeared on <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.questgate.net/" TARGET="_parent">Alice's Ultima IX: Ascension Information/News Page</A> regarding the lack of a female Avatar in Ultima IX:<BR><BR>

<I>The female Avatar presented two problems. The first is due to time and game footprint constraints. Two years ago the flics for the game were rendered and at that time with the male. We considered then re-doing them to have a set with the female, but they are very time costly and re-rendering would be a problem. Since the decision from "on high" (Richard and other OSI managers) was to go with voice for the whole game, then with the number of lines for the Avatar (~4000) would double, due to the addition of the female Avatar. Also all of the NPC lines would increase by a great deal so that they could respond to the different gender. This would also greatly increase the number of CDs required for the game. So based on what we were required to place in the game, certain cuts had to be made. To defend the decision however, the immersiveness of the environment screams and begs for voice over, so we have pursued that route instead of the text only.<BR><BR>

Secondly we canvassed a series of female players and they felt that even though they had played females before, if the game was great...gender was less important. Also, the number of female players of computer games is only about 5% of the market. Except with games like Myst and Riven where the predominant number of players are women. The facts finally nailed the coffin on the lid of the female Avatar. To be honest, I fought for it, but I am only a little voice.</I><BR><BR>

<U>23 January 1998</U><BR><BR>

Here's a brief run-down from Bob White about the Ultima IX preview due to ship with the Ultima Collection:<BR><BR>

<I>The UIX preview is a series of sections cut from the various CG flics 
within the game that are stitched together. It provides a wonderful 
look at the "feel" of what you will be up against in the game. There 
are no in game shots, and it runs like a movie trailer. The music is 
incredible (done in house by Joe Basquez). The idea is to begin the 
anticipation of the game (as if that was needed). If it does not get 
you excited you are probably already dead.</I><BR><BR>


Building on a tidbit about Ultima IX that originally appeared on <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.questgate.net/" TARGET="_parent">Alice's Ultima IX: Ascension Information/News Page</A>:<BR><BR>

The Ultima IX team has divided NPCs into two categories, relevants and generics.  Eighty percent of the NPCs in the game will be relevants with completely scripted conversations, and the remaining twenty percent will be generics with unscripted conversations.<BR><BR>

The "generics" will consist of longshoremen, castle guards, pirate crews, bandits/hiwaymen, etc.<BR><BR>

There will be over 100 "relevants" in the game.<BR><BR> 

<U>22 January 1998</U><BR><BR>

It's not much in the way of Ultima IX news, but the Origin website is now saying that the Ultima Collection (with the Ultima IX preview) is due to ship on February 17th.<BR><BR>

Here are a couple tidbits about Ultima IX from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.questgate.net/" TARGET="_parent">Alice's Ultima IX: Ascension Information/News Page</A>:<BR><BR>

<LI>In a return to the older Ultimas, Ultima IX will handle stat generation in a way similar to the Gypsy fortuneteller in Ultimas IV, V, and VI, but much better according to Brian Martin.<BR><BR>

<LI>Confirming what is already in the FAQ, swimming is definitely going to be included in Ultima IX.<BR><BR>

<LI>Each and every NPC in the game, excepting the guards, will have their own conversation script, to avoid the cookie-cutter NPCs seen in Ultima VIII: Pagan.<BR><BR>

<U>21 January 1998</U><BR><BR>

Here's the latest from Robert White, the lead designer of Ultima IX:<BR><BR>

<LI>Michael Dorn will no longer be playing the voice of The Guardian.  His voice had neither the power nor range Origin felt was necessary to play the part.  Talks are now underway with other actors to play The Guardian and while Origin will not comment on who they are talking to, they say that it is a name we'll be familiar with.<BR><BR>

<LI>Every command in the game will be user-configurable, including moving the mouse commands to the keyboard.<BR><BR>

<LI>There will be no option for a female Avatar.<BR><BR>

<LI>In addition to the cinematics throughout the game, set-scenes will also be included featuring the Avatar as observer.  The set-scenes will be similar to the ones seen in Crusader: No Remorse.<BR><BR>

Regarding whether or not there will be 3DFX goodies like colored light in Ultima IX:<BR><BR>

<I>1. Oh yes! In fact that section is already in the engine, including 
moving light sources (torches, light spells, lanterns, fireballs, 
etc.).</I><BR><BR>

On the game's system requirements:<BR><BR>

<I>2. Unfortunately, this has changed to. The change was based on what we 
feel would be a standard available machine a few months prior to the 
release data and what the minimal requirements to get the best 
enjoyment out of the game. At the time (way back) it was the P90 as 
you spec-ed. Now the minimum machine looks to be a P233, 32 Mb RAM, 3D 
video acceleration. Recommended machine will be a P266, 64Mb RAM, 3D 
video acceleration.</I><BR><BR>

On the current state of the game's development:<BR><BR>

<I>Current State<BR><BR>
1. We are talking about getting the UIX official web site up and 
running. Marketing and EA HQ will be helping getting this running. 
Brian and I will still remain the official contact for info. No 
current timetable for completion as yet.<BR><BR>

2. A great deal of the world has been laid out in the editor and can 
be moved around in and observed. Doing this in 3D and making it look 
good is difficult and tedious.<BR><BR>

3. Some of the puzzles and events are in the game and operate. Doors 
are opening, torches lighting, things exploding...you get the idea.<BR><BR>

4. Now that the terrain and buildings are placed down, we have taken a 
break from construction to look at some of the elements in the game. 
We have gone through the plot in detail and have patched all of the 
holes that existed. Now myself and all of the designers are going 
through each town, dungeon, and possible interest area and are putting 
together a...module for each of these areas. (This is borrowing a term 
from AD&D, but it is very similar). Every situation, event, sound 
effect, visual effect is being written down in painful detail. The one 
for Moonglow I just completed the other day is around 27 pages (of 
very small font) in length! Some of them are larger and very few 
smaller.<BR><BR>

5. The core engine is in place and functional. We still have 
optimization to go.<BR><BR>

So what is next on the agenda<BR><BR>
1. Getting the major RPG subsystems into the engine. They are all 
designed ( They are still fluid and could be tweaked and altered, so 
keep the suggestions coming) and need only the implementation from our 
fine coding team.<BR><BR>

2. Those amazing artist are churning out objects like whirling 
dervishes. As they come off the line they are inspected, verified and 
then given the thumbs up to go in the game. Once we complete all of 
the "modules" and clean them up, we will begin the placing and 
activation of these objects.</I><BR><BR>

<U>16 January 1998</U><BR><BR>

Robert White, the lead designer of Ultima IX, had this to say about Ultima IX's engine on rec.games.computer.ultima.dragons:<BR><BR>

<I>The way it will work is not really like Dungeon Keeper (but I do love 
that game!). Think of the world as a single piece, seamless, edge of 
world to edge. The camera can float about the world and view it from 
any perspective. The only catch is that it will always try to keep the 
Avatar in the middle of the screen. There is a slight lag, just to 
soften the motion and keep it from being to jerky on the eyes (whoa! 
did we get motion sickness for a while). You can move the camera up to 
the "equivalent" of isometric, but as pointed out, it is not a "true" 
isometric since the camera has perspective. In other words things will 
get smaller the farther away they are. Items close up will be larger. 
This can be seen most prominently in our game when the Avatar passes 
next to taller objects (like trees) and their tops appear large while 
the Avatar seems much smaller next to them.<BR><BR>
 
As I said you can move the camera to any position. From at the Avatars 
feet, looking up at him, to directly overhead, straight down at his 
head. The camera cannot displace from the Avatar by more than a 
minuscule amount since everything is geared to his position in the 
world, and we don't want things happening that the player cannot 
clearly see.<BR><BR>
 
You will be able to zoom out and in, but there is caveat. As you zoom 
out more polygons will fill the screen. There will be a point about 
which we will restrict any farther zoom due to this fact. Otherwise 
your frame rate goes right down the toilet. Zooming in is possible and 
there is no pixelation due to the hardware acceleration.  Zooming in 
will probably be stopped at the point where you also would not be able 
to pick up on what is going on around you. In addition as you zoom in 
the perspective widens and zooming out it narrows, just like a real 
camera.<BR><BR>
 
You can look up at the sky and you will see the it and clouds and 
stars and all that stuff (depending on time of day of course)<BR><BR>

We will have a horizon and some additional distance references that 
trick the eye into making the world seem even more lively, but I 
cannot give that away.</I><BR><BR>

Thanks Elf Dragon!<BR><BR>


<U>8 January 1998</U><BR><BR>

The following letter arrived in my mailbox this afternoon from Robert White, the lead designer of Ultima IX:<BR><BR>


<I>Hello Sith Dragon...<BR><BR>

Good of you to drop by the other day and speak with us. I thought I
would send to you a response I sent out to another individual who is
concerned about what changes we have made in Ultima IX.  I discussed
with our producer, Ed Del Castillo, the need for opening these lines of
communication with the Dragons and concerened individuals again. He
agreed enthusiastically and he thinks that Brian Martin (associate
producer) and myself (lead designer) should lead the charge in this
matter. We will be trying to address the issues of UIX as often as we
can and hopefully on a regular basis. Any querys addressed to us or
posted on the news groups will certainly be read and for the most part
answered, but let me lay down some ground rules before I start.<BR><BR>

1. We will not discuss the plot or plot relevent issues. We think it
would detract from the enjoyment of the game. Its the same as reading
the end of a mystery novel and still expecting to get all of the
emotional impact of the rest of the book.<BR><BR>

2. We may not answer some issues concerning the game engine. this is do
to the great amount of competition in the industry and we don't want our
competitors to know what we are up to.<BR><BR>

3. We may not get to answer all querys. Simplyt put, we don't have
enough time to answer everything and to get the game out on a timely
basis (yes, I know we have been working on this a while, but...)<BR><BR>

4. We will answer truthfully, for we have no reason to provide you
incorrect information. Do bear in mind that during development some
issues may occur that will cause previous answers to suddenly be wrong.
This is the nature of the game development cycle. We are not
purposefully sowing disinformation.<BR><BR>

A little background first...I understand your concerns toward UIX
"selling out" for additional sales. I have played and enjoyed Ultima's
since Akalabeth. Richard and I grew up together and I remember playing
Akalabeth at a time when it would have been in the state now refered to
as "pre-Alpha". So I know how all of you fans feel out there. However a
certain eveloution must occur in games or they will become stagnant. I
think all of the fine features you love about CRPG's will be in the game
and in spades! Richard and I are making sure that the game will remain
true to the ideals of an Ultima and we hope what will come of this
(learned from the lessons of past Ultimas) will be a better stronger and
more accessable game, without sacrificing the qualties we have all come
to love.<BR><BR>

Now let me answer some of the specific concerns in your e-mail.<BR><BR>

1. We realize that many people when looking at the screen shots scream
"Oh my god...It's Tomb Raider with the Avatar." I admit there are some
visual similarities, but the two are miles apart in functionality and
flexability. You will be able to view any scene from what ever angle you
feel like. If you are more comfotable working from a more top down view,
you can rotate your camera to that position to deal with the world.<BR><BR>

One of the comments we got from people who have viewed the operating
engine and game environments, is that it is amazingly immersive, far
more so than Tomb Raider. From this view you feel more in the game than
a spectator. In the past the top down view was a necessity, driven by
the technolgy, in order to provide the immersiveness of Britannia. Now
with the full 3D world, this other view (third person, tag-along), is
more immersive. Once you have the chance to actually move around in the
enivronment, I think you will find that a top down isometric, isn't as
"kick-ass" as the tag-along is. Do not jump to judgement to quickly for
I and several others fought this move for a long time, but now that I
have spent many hours working in the engine and moving through the game
environments, tag-along is the only way to go with this game.<BR><BR>

Some of the nice benifits of this style of camera view is that it
allows us to:<BR><BR>

A. Eliminate roof and tree popping, since you can now look all around
the environment without being blocked.<BR><BR>

B. Movement within three dimensions that FEELS like moving in three
dimensions. This was   the forte of such first person games like Quake,
System Shock, etc. Now we have it in Britannia.<BR><BR>

C. No items are hidden behind walls.<BR><BR>

There are a few more, but I will stop there. Fear not, this view will
not take anything away from what you feel is an Ultima, for it has
always been much more than just a top down isometric game.<BR><BR>

The old screen shots from the isometric view are still from this same
engine. In fact I can still generate them as they were, but we tried
moving the camera around and this was the best feel of all of them. Once
again, you will still be able to move it around to see the environment
from any angle.<BR><BR>

2. About attracting action gamers...Well I could just say that this is
a business and the bottom line is still making sales, but I am sure you
realize this. By attracting action gamers we would obviously increase
sales, but we are well aware of the possibility of losing hard core CRPG
players. The way we wish to attract these action gamers is to provide a
more lively and visually fabulous combat and magic system. Currently the
combat is still in the preliminary stages, and we haven't played with it
alot yet. Once we get a chance to play with ait and balance it, we think
it will be the finest ever developed, but I really can't go into any
details of our plans.<BR><BR>

If you notice, alot of the action games (except military simulators)
are extremely easy to use. Simple keyboard commands and few of them.
This is one of the most major changes we have made. The interface will
be extremely simplified, but there will be layers of complexity that can
be found as the players skill increases. However, the game should be
playable at the most simplistic level, albeit harder. I don't see any
CRPG players getting to bent up about the combat once they get to try
it.<BR><BR>

Now let me address some of the points that I think really make it an
Ultima rather than meerly the outward appearance.<BR><BR>

1. Detailed, involved, non-linear plot.<BR><BR>

2. Player can effect the world. The world responds to the players
actions.<BR><BR>

3. Immersive world with lively realistic characters.<BR><BR>

4. Things to do outside of the mainplot.<BR><BR>

5. Lots and lots of open areas to explore, with unique things to see
and danger all about.<BR><BR>

These are the things that really make this game what it is and they are
all still present in Ultima IX.<BR><BR>

Please save judgement on the game until you get a chance to really see
what we have done. We will release a demo a few months ahead of the
game, so keep your eyes open for the announcement. Game shots that are
appearing in magazines now (check Next Gen in February) are static and
give you and idea of what it may look like, but truly, the feel is where
your judgement should lie...Does it still feel like an Ultima....My
answer is a definite yes!<BR><BR>

Please feel free to post this on usenet or web pages. Thanks for letting
us know how you feel.</I><BR><BR>

<U>6 January 1998</U><BR><BR>

It's not really news, but <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.origin.ea.com/ultima/uc/index.html" TARGET="_parent">Origin</a> has put up a new page hyping the forthcoming Ultima Collection, making numerous references to the Ultima IX preview included in the package.  

<BR><BR>

<U>3 January 1998</U><BR><BR>

In a new <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.gamecenter.com/Peeks/Roleplay/role2.html" TARGET="_parent">Gamecenter article</a> about upcoming 1998 CRPGs Ed Del Castillo, producer of Ultima IX, spoke about the game:<BR><BR>

<LI>NPC merchants will travel from city to city in Britannia, and their goods and prices will vary according to availability of stock.<BR><BR>

<LI>In an attempt to make a departure from what Origin considers to be overly conversation-driven CRPGs, Ultima IX will feature real-time quests presented to the player visually rather than through NPCs.<BR><BR>

<LI>Combat in Ultima IX will be real-time, rather than turn-based.<BR><BR>

<LI>Ultima IX will feature what Origin calls a "smart inventory" system, where things of a particular type -- like reagents, money, food, etc. -- will automatically be placed into specific containers for them.<BR><BR>

<LI>In an effort to reproduce real world physics in Ultima IX, every object in the game will have the ability to influence other objects.  For example, a spell cast in a room can knock objects off a table; a sign, when bumped, will swing; a ship in water will actually float on the surface.<BR><BR>

<LI>Regarding the point of view in the game, Del Castillo seems to infer that the player will have control over the camera placement in the game, which would set it apart from the Tomb Raider engine somewhat and seems to be a return to the rotatable camera mentioned by Origin in the past.<BR><BR>

<LI>Ultima IX will feature a 16 bit color palette.<BR><BR>

<LI>The Ultima IX team is devoting a lot of time to creating new monsters, spells, arms and armor and a way for player actions to have a discernible effect on Britannia.<BR><BR>
