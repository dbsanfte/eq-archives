<U>31 December 1997</U><BR><BR>

Since I have the week between Christmas and New Year's off from work, I thought I would get in a lot of time in Ultima Online.  Unfortunately, in a sense, I received Fallout as a Christmas present.<BR><BR>

I've always been a fan of Ultima from the first time I ever played Akalabeth, but I have to say that in my opinion Fallout is the one <EM>perfect</EM> CRPG that I've ever had the absolute pleasure to play.  Simply put, there is nothing that I would change about the game.  The cinematics establish (and suit) the tone of the game perfectly, the sound quality is excellent, and the story and voice talent are absolutely top notch.  The one part of CRPGs that I dislike the most, combat, is handled so well in Fallout that I found myself actually looking forward to it.  If you have any holiday money left over and you're looking for a great CRPG, you'll thank yourself for picking up Fallout.  (Don't be turned off by the post-Apocalyptic setting as I thought I would initially be, because in Fallout it's handled as well as any fantasy setting I've ever seen done in a game.)<BR><BR>

When I finished Fallout (which is more of a testament to its quality rather than to its length), I was able to get a good counter viewpoint to what I'm looking for in a CRPG online or otherwise.  Fallout excels in every area where Ultima Online falters or does not cover at all.  The single element that kept me glued to Fallout for the past week, much to my wife's chagrin, was the fantastic story.  I needed to find that damn water chip and, quite frankly, I couldn't have cared less about whether or not 10,000 people could play the game with me at once.  In fact, in light of Fallout, I'm beginning to think that multiplayer is anathema to what a CRPG is.<BR><BR>

As I'm sitting here trying to decide what game to play next, I have to admit that the thought of playing through Fallout again as a different style of character is a lot more attractive to me then picking up Ultima Online again.  <BR><BR>

<U>16 December 1997</U><br><br>

I've been playing on and off for the last couple of days, and I have to admit that a certain amount of apathy on my part is beginning to show itself.  Now that I'm a grandmaster swordsman, there really is little left that presents me with a challenge.<br><br>

While I realize that a certain amount of player-generated initiative is required for a game like Ultima Online, it's somewhat frustrating to know that in many ways Ultima Online is really only about character building.  Although I would like to think that a story will actually begin to emerge in the game, I'm beginning to think that it will take much, much more patience than I have to ever see it.  The game has been public for three months now, and there's barely a hint that there's more to the game than just going out into the woods, killing stuff, and bringing the loot back to the bank.<br><br>

I've been busying myself with trying to raise my notoriety and stats (both of which seem fixed after a couple days of fruitless trying) with the nebulous goal of becoming a virtue guard, but it's starting to become not enough of an incentive to continue playing the game.  This is, I believe, one of the greatest problems facing Ultima Online -- giving players reasons to continue playing.<br><br>

I will definitely continue playing the game until I have enough gold to pay for my tower, but I honestly cannot say how long I'll play past then.  Wow, I never thought I'd say that.<br><br>

<U>12 December 1997</U><br><br>

I gained another point of swordsmanship (now up to 97%), but I don't see this as a sign of the game allowing you to advance too easily.  I was involved in what had to be the longest running battle I have ever heard of or seen in Ultima Online.  For five hours, a small group of people (including myself) were in a respawn area on the western coast and had to fight back wave after wave of monsters.<br><br>

Every time we tried to leave the area going south, we would run into a respawn of orcs or trolls.  Trying to exit north we would run into a respawn of ettins and gargoyles.  For hours, we battled back and forth and back again, but eventually were able to clear the area of monsters and we all headed back to the cities to sell our booty.<br><br>

I am rapidly becoming convinced of the value of using magic as a warrior.  If you can cast healing spells your ability to remain in combat is limited only by your spellcasting ability and the amount of reagents you have.  Also, given the fact that Orcs now seem to spawn in swarms, the ability to cast field spells really does help take the sting out of running into an Orc camp.  Now that my swordsmanship skill has been developed as far as it can go, I'm beginning to think about concentrating on magery while I continue to work on raising my notoriety.

<br><br>

<U>11 December 1997</U><br><br>

I finally reached Grandmaster status as a swordsman -- whew.  I was always under the impression, and I thought this was the case with my GM Archer character, that you became a grandmaster when your skill hit 100%, but now the cut-off seems to be at 95%.<br><br>

I only had an hour to play today, but the respawning problems seem to be a thing of the past, as (at least on Atlantic) the western portion of Britannia is absolutely crawling with monsters of every kind.  This is a good thing, mostly, but coupled with the fact that Origin has made combat inordinately difficult it might make like very tough on newbie characters.  I hope Origin re-tweaks the combat difficulty because it has gone from too easy to too hard, and a middle ground needs to be met.  For instance, I spent five minutes fighting a troll this morning before I defeated it.  Now such a fight might be more realistic, but I'm a grandmaster and if I spend five minutes hacking something to death it ought to be something tougher than a troll.  It really ought to be fixed.<br><br>

The inclusion of Orc Mages really is a good thing to add to the mix, but I think they might be too tough.  If something as common as an Orc Mage can put a grandmaster on the ropes, they're going to make mincemeat out of weaker characters.  Since Orcs are so common, and Orc Mages seem about as common as the normal types (imho), their magic abilities should be toned down some because they're a ubiquious monster in Britannia and I don't think we want to make it impossible for folks to survive outside of the justice areas.<br><br>

On another topic, Quake 2 deathmatch is an absolute blast.  (Even single player is great, and it's even better if you have a 3D card.)  We're running a Quake 2 server at the office (209.14.146.36) that's open to the public, if any of you have the game.  You might even run into me as my Quake alter ego.  Gotta love that BFG 10K.<br><br>

<U>10 December 1997</U><br><br>

I played a bit this morning with the new (large) patch that came out this week, and I have to say that combat has gotten a hell of a lot tougher.  With the inclusion of Orc Mages into the run-of-the-mill Orc camps, stumbling onto a newly-spawned camp is a bit more of a challenge than it has been in the past.  Across the board, though, combat seems to have been made tougher -- for instance, I actually had to run from an ettin this morning, something I have never had to do in the past.<br><br>

Monsters respawning in houses seems to be quite a problem (at least on Atlantic), and is something that Origin really should fix.  There's nothing stopping me, except myself, from building a tower on the respawn area west of Yew and hoarding all the monsters.<br><br>

I haven't had as much time as I would have liked to play Ultima Online, but you see I set up a Quake2 server here at work and it really is a great game.  I've never really been enthralled by a 3D shooter, but both single and multiplayer Quake2 are a joy to play.  I was indifferent to Quake, and only played through it once in single player, and thought that it had promise as a net game, but Quake2 really is an evolutionary move forward for the genre.  If you have a 3D accelerator (I have the Righteous 3D), Quake2 is really very, very nice on the eyes.<br><br>

<U>8 December 1997</U><br><br>

Woohoo!  Not only did I gain another point of swordsmanship (now up to 96%), but I also was able to raise my notoriety to Noble level.  That, and I broke 40,000 gold in the bank.  Only 10,000 more to go to get that tower I've wanted.<br><br>

Spawns seem to be happening more rapidly, and the toughness of monsters (at least where I hunt) seems to have gone up dramatically.  For instance, after not having seen a gargoyle in over a month I ended up standing in the middle of a respawn of two gargs, a gazer, and a reaper on one screen.  I've begun using magic now for the first time today -- only to heal, though.  I normally don't like using magic (never have, even in the pen-and-paper RPG days), but the fact that I have to go up against the super monsters to have any hope of raising my skills and notoriety requires that I be able to heal quickly.<BR><BR>

The only complaint I really have with UO lately is the fact that client crashes seem to be happening at least two or three times everyday.  This is kind of scary because they haven't happened at all to me since the game went retail, so something new is gumming up the works.  They happen most when I'm picking stuff up off of corpses (return of the container bug?) and when I try to log out in an inn.<br><br>

<U>4 December 1997</U><br><br>

I haven't been playing as much lately as I usually do because of the time needed to revamp the web site, but I still managed to devote some effort into building up my swordsman character. Increasing your swordsmanship skill when you reach Master level is excrutiatingly slow, and it's disconcerting to know that the only guaranteed way of increasing your skill is through suicidal assaults on monsters that everyone else wisely avoids.  It just seems to me that if I can successfully clear out an orc camp, and then a ratman camp, that it should count just as much as when I kill a single elemental.<br><br>

As my character continues to grow, the amount of money I have in the bank is growing to ridiculously high levels.  In a way, my main motivation in continuing to play the game is to know that when I retire this character (and finish with Ultima Online), my character's retirement home will be his own castle on some suitably remote island.  I would like to become a virtue guard before I quit the game, but advancing your notoriety happens so slowly I fear my interest would wain before I ever became a Great Lord.
