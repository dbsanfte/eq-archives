<U>31 May 1998</U><BR><BR>

Now that E3 is officially over, the post-convention U:A reports are starting to make their way in.<BR><BR>

This one comes to us from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.gamewise.com/e3/news10.shtml" TARGET="_parent">Gamewise</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>Summary of Interview with Lord British<BR><BR>

In an interview with Lord British, Nick Pleis found out that indeed the current build of Ultima: Ascension is not running very well and requires more optimizations. Also known as Ultima 9 and, like it's predecessors Ultima 1-8, this is an RPG. It's not an action, adventure or Strategy game. It's another story in the continuing Ultima series. Besides the skill system, the only other major difference from the earlier Ultima's is that this one is 3D. However, just because it's 3D doesn't mean it's going to be like Ultima Online. This time, the world will be made to be more fun than too realistic, as it was in Ultima Online. This time, the Gaurdian will play a much more active role in the game. Even the town isn't safe. For example, there's a couple of NPC's in town, a dog and his master. If you approach them in anyway, the dog will attack you.<BR><BR> 

Contrary to what was said by OSI last night, there will be a party system but it's not player controlled. NPC's will join or leave your party under their own volition. They'll act consistently with their alignments, too. For instance, a "Good" NPC will soon tire of a player who is doing evil things and will leave or fight against him/her.<BR><BR> 

The Skill system in Ultima 9 departs from those of the past. You start with a few basic skills and will only learn more as you've mastered the ones you have. In other words, if you don't develop the skills you have, you will eventually lose them. But, as you gain mastery of them, new ones will be added</I><BR><BR>

Thanks, Deorc Dragon!<BR><BR>

As E3 enters into its final day, the U:A reports continue to pop up:<BR><BR>

This excerpt on U:A comes from Mental4 and his <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.scorched.com" TARGET="_parent">Ultima.Scorched.Com</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>The last demo of the show was given by Richard Garriott himself, and as with all of Garriott's presentations at the show, he gave the opportunity for questions and answers following his official demo.  He talked some about the plot to Ascension and some of the changes that it has undergone, but I will wait before giving out these details so that I can organize them coherently.<BR><BR> 

Richard emphasized his role as a designer on this project as opposed to other roles that he has occupied in the past.  For instance, he built one quarter of the demo world himself.  He also wrote one quarter of the conversation code in C, something he said that he has not done for the past several games in the series.  It seemed clear to me that Garriott is intimately involved with Ultima: Ascension and its design, something that has been the subject of debate in the past.<BR><BR> 

Richard talked briefly about the future without going into specific details.  He mentioned Ultima Online II which, while not announced, is planned to be fully 3 dimensional and very similar to Ascension.  Not only are the visuals expected to migrate to Ultima Online II, but Ultima: Ascension's progressive skill system is another planned inclusion for Ultima Online II.<BR><BR> 

As for any post-Ascension game, Garriott said that one of the plot points of Ascension is the destruction/resurrection of the world.  Originally, he wanted to destroy the world, but the team talked him out of it, so now he's not sure exactly what will happen to the world at the end of the game.  Whatever happens, the end of Ultima: Ascension will be designed to set the stage for a new fiction, with a new philosophic angle that Garriott wants to explore.</I><BR><BR>

<I>Ultima Ascension First Look<BR>
by Jason Cross<BR><BR>

Origin put together a special 400MB demo of the ninth in the Ultima series for the show, and I stopped by to get the scoop on the title. As you probably know, the part-based overhead view of times past has been replaced with a 3D engine in which you only control the Avatar. The world in this engine is one huge map, with pieces dynamically loaded as you move around. The frame rate at the show was more than a bit choppy, but it's still completely unoptimized. There are also lots of placeholder textures, so while the environment looked very good it will be improved. The day and night sequence was especially nice, with the avatar being lit from one side with a heavy orange light as the sun rose and set.<BR><BR> 

Many have been worried that Origin is turning Ultima into a Tomb Raider clone. These fears are not completely unfounded, but don't worry. While the heavy-duty RPG "number management" elements have been toned down to appeal to a larger audience, the emphasis is not on jumping from ledges and such so much as exploration, and conversation with NPCs. There will be over a hundred NPCs along with the usual "generic" characters like guards, each represented with full speech. Origin has no intent on forgetting the lessons learned with Ultima 8, and while you won't be able to play as them, the Avatar's companions Iolo, Dupre, and Shamino will be returning. The theme, like previous good Ultima games, will be heavily based on morality and social change, but they're not giving too much away. All we know is that by the time the Avatar returned from Pagan, the Guardian had all but taken over Brittania. And all the horses have been killed for some reason, as the only "vehicle" mode of travel is via ships.<BR><BR> 

Hard-core Ultima fans may be disappointed by the "change of pace," Origin is taking in an attempt to reach a broader audience, but the storytelling aspect of the game and the richness of the game world that we have come to expect are all top-notch. Despite the change, they should have a winner on their hands. Expect the game to require a voodoo-class 3D card or better when it's released, hopefully by the end of the year.</I><BR><BR>

<I>Avatar Ascending<BR> 
by Richard Greenhill<BR><BR>  

Speaking with the producer of Ultima: Ascension, Del Castillo, I tried to find out all the latest on this recently controversial title. Many have felt that Ascension looks to be moving away from the RPG genre altogether, which could be considered sacriledge to dedicated fans of the long-running Ultima series. And indeed, watching Castillo run me through some sections of the game that they had ready for E3, it could have been mistaken for a graphically-enhanced Tomb Raider.<BR><BR> 

The viewpoint follows the Avatar from above and behind, much like the aforementioned game (and a lot of action titles of late). Control of your character is similar to Quake - keyboard for movement, mouse for looking around. The camera changes its position depending on if you're near walls and certain objects.<BR><BR> 

The game'll require a whopping P200 with 32mb, and 3D acceleration will be supported though not essential (but recommended). Castillo's demonstration depicted the Avatar in some ogre combat in your typical RPG dungeon. Combat's in real-time, with a range of moves at your disposal. Blood and gore was quite apparent, not overly used, but splashed around effectively and stained the floors. Although it wasn't specifically apparent in this demo, Castillo noted the different enemies are susceptible to different types of attack.<BR><BR> 

There were some "cool technical quirks" like the way you can pick up an item, place it on a little table, or even on a small shelf just above the table. We were then shown the outside environment, which like many 3D titles, doesn't quite manage to pull off a realistic grass texture. Skyline texture was "blocky 8-bit, but will support 16-bit for higher end machines." Actual buildings and general land objects, like the water fountain in the town center, looked pretty good, and gave a nice impression of a large location of people and community to explore.<BR><BR> 

Some cool looking spells were showed off too, including "ring of fire", which, after an enthusiastic incantation animation, produces a blast of fire around your character that spreads out and toasts surrounding enemies - doesn't sound hugely original, but the 3dfx lighting effects make it worthwhile to see. That sentiment also applies to the "ice barrier", which creates a number of long, thick spiked ice poles protruding from the ground to prevent enemies chasing you - and when the barrier is attacked, the blast effect from your weapon can send individual poles on a direct course to impale your body.<BR><BR> 

Concerning the gameplay elements under recent attack, I queried Castillo on how he answers criticisms that Ascension is too much of a break from what the fans expect of a title using the Ultima moniker.<BR><BR> 

"Where Ascension is concerned, our goal is to fully maximize emotional impact," he replied, showing no tone of resentment towards these accusations. "A viewpoint does not necessarily indicate a game type, so it doesn't make Ascension another Tomb Raider. The game will still be every bit as deep as the Ultima games, with riddles, puzzles, and lots of character interaction.<BR><BR> 

"The viewpoint was used because we very much want the game to make a big impact on the player. YOU are the Avatar. The camera always precisely follows the Avatar's head movement, so you always see exactly what he sees. We want people to play the game, and have instantly memorable experiences that last with them and make them think back to how 'cool it was that time in Ascension when...'<BR><BR> 

"Also, where dialogue is concerned, there will be a lot of talking, but we're trying to cut it down as much as possible. Previous Ultima's conversation was often long-winded. We're looking to produce a more immersive visual storyline - for example, an instance from a previous Ultima: you would be walking along, and find a woman weeping in her home. You speak with her and she tells you that her husband's been dragged off by orcs, will you help. Yes or no? In Ascension, we would have you wandering along, and suddenly a house door bursts open, and a main is being dragged off by Orcs, his wife screaming after them - she turns to you and pleads, 'help me!' Yes or no, right there, you've witnessed the event, the decision is yours."<BR><BR> 

Ascension was still considered to be in the "pre-alpha" stage, and even crashed twice while I witnessed the demo. However, Origin expect the final release to be this coming Fall.</I><BR><BR>

E3 rolls into its second day, and the first-hand experiences with U:A continue to come in.<BR><BR>

This excerpt on U:A comes from Mental4 and his <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.scorched.com" TARGET="_parent">Ultima.Scorched.Com</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>I did get to talk to Ed DelCastillo at length today about many of the issues surrounding Ultima: Ascension.  Ed is very passionate about his plans for the game, and has some specific goals in mind for the game's completion.  Most of these involve maintaining the underlying elements of a traditional role playing game, but making them transparent or invisible to the person playing the game.  I will have more to say about our discussion once I have returned and organized my notes.</I><BR><BR>

<I>Ultima: Ascension<BR><BR>
 
Ultima: Ascension is the ninth installment in the Ultima series, which EA is planning to release in Fall 1998. Hoping to evolve the Ultima franchise past the boundaries of role-playing games, Ultima: Ascension is poised to push action oriented role-playing to the extreme through 3D gameplay. EA is rethinking the fantasy gaming category through a combination of a 3D fantasy world, exciting visuals, and nonstop action. A player will assume the role of the Avatar, fantasy gaming's greatest hero, and set off on a quest to encounter over 50 characters and creatures. Difficulty levels will be scalable and inventory management systems will be easy to use. Ultima: Ascension promises to include no hard-core stats or complicated inventories to take care of, only fun compelling adventure and action.<BR><BR> 

By Walter Morbeck, GameSpot</I><BR><BR>

<U>28 May 1998</U><BR><BR>

With E3 opening today, the first first-hand impressions of the game are starting to trickle in.<BR><BR>

This report on U:A comes from the inimitable Mental4 and his <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://ultima.scorched.com" TARGET="_parent">Ultima.Scorched.Com</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>I have now seen Ultima 9 and my feelings about the game are twofold. Although the visuals lack the polish of Unreal, they are extremely nice.<BR><BR> 

Long time Ultima fans may be pleased with at least one aspect of the game - the use of Bill Johnson as the voice of the Avatar. Johnson, of course, was the Avatar's voice in Ultima 7 and Serpent Isle, and the voice overs that I heard sounded fantastic.<BR><BR>

<B>[Sith's Note: Johnson was the voice of the Guardian, not the Avatar.  I suspect this is a typo.]</B><BR><BR> 

There appears to be good attention to incidental objects in the world such as creatures in the forest, subtle physics details, and other effects (such as night and day).<BR><BR> 

The con side of this is that currently the engine runs noticeably slow. The main demo machine was a pII-300, with a VooDoo 2 card, and when turning or moving in a direction the movement is frequently interrupted by stuttering.<BR><BR> 

This game is clearly being targeted at gamers more familiar with action games. The official press release, which I will have available in full upon my return, states the following:<BR><BR>
 
<B>Ultima: Ascension is an action-adventure game set in the Ultima universe. There are no hard-core stats or inventory management; nothing to take away from the fun, just compelling adventure and intense action.</B><BR><BR> 

The lack of inventory management was an item that I was concerned about, and upon pressing an OSI marketing representative I was told that this function was not yet finished, and thus not available for the show. The press release would seem to imply that there is no inventory management in the game at all. I will be asking Ed DelCastillo for clarification on this matter tomorrow.<BR><BR> 

The demo being shown has six available areas, including the towns of Asylum, Cove, and a dugeon area. One aspect of the game that is being emphasized at E3 is that the entire world is one world and fully connected, rather than being in pieces. This did appear to be the case from what I saw running. Despite the small twitches in game motion, there were no long loading times while going from one area to another.<BR><BR> 

Combat looks very realistic and natural; the Avatar has two weapons to choose from in the version being shown at E3: a staff or a sword. I witnessed the Avatar fighting skeletons both in caves and underwater (yes, the skeletons will swim toward you in the water), doing battle with a crab on the beach, and fighting a demon which he summoned himself.<BR><BR> 

I have seen five or six different spells demonstrated, and the gesturing motions used by the Avatar during spell casting and the associated effects are very well done. The press release claims that the final game will have "45 spectacular spells".<BR><BR> 

One final detail that set this Ultima apart from the rest of the series is a new logo. I have obtained a printed version of this logo and will be scanning it for inclusion on this site when I return.<BR><BR> 

My final thoughts for today: Ultima: Ascension looks like a very pretty game. Unfortunately, I think it's clear at this point that this will in no way be a role playing game. Even the category description on the press release categorizes the game as "fantasy action-adventure". Taken in this context, I believe the game will be a lot of fun, and very detailed, however I think the suspicions of the core Ultima fans over the last few months have been right on the money.</I><BR><BR>

This report on U:A comes from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.gamecenter.com" TARGET="_parent">Gamecenter</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>Oh, my--does Ultima IX: Ascension look sweet. The grand finale to the Ultima saga (at least with regard to the Avatar), Ultima Ascension blends third-person real-time motion with the kind of intricate, plot-filled story that Ultima fans crave.<BR><BR> 

Hard-core RPG fans needn't fret--although this ninth Ultima installment will include over-the-shoulder perspectives and some action fighting, it won't be filled with frustrating action sequences that you have to successfully navigate to make progress, as in Ultima VIII. Of course, if you're handy with the sword, you'll have a leg up on the villains. 
The game's story line will tie up any unanswered (and several unasked) questions about the Avatar and the Ultima universe. The Avatar returns to Brittania to find that the Guardian has taken over the world, where he has built massive columns in eight locations. Each column is in the same place as Ultima III's mystic shrines. Combined, they're leeching the energy from Brittania. As usual, the Avatar must halt this nefarious scheme<BR><BR>
. 
So what's different this time around in terms of gameplay? Well, for starters, and this is kind of a bummer, the Avatar no longer has statistical attributes. As he gains experience, you'll start to see changes in the way he looks, walks, and attacks. Also, because the game is shot from an over-the-character perspective, you'll be controlling a single character most of the way. But there's plenty of character interaction--you'll be able to chat up just about anybody, and you'll run into old characters from Ultima games past, such as Shamino. And to break up the gameplay, you'll also be able to play as other characters as the story line progresses. You'll play as Shamino, for instance, to break the Avatar out of prison at one point, and later in the game, you'll even be able to play as the biggest badass, Lord British!<BR><BR> 

Spellcasting will work in two ways--there's spell-based magic and potion-based magic. The spell-based casting works as you'd expect: You find spells and you memorize them. The potion-based is more old-fashioned and Ultima IV-ish: You mix reagents to create awesome concoctions. You cast spells by moving your cursor over to the target and then releasing your spell.<BR><BR> 

Ultima IX: Ascension should ship by the end of this year.<BR><BR>

This report on U:A comes from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.e3.net/live/ultima528.html" TARGET="_parent">E3.net</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>I have seen the future of Ultima and it is good... and bad. Bad for any of us role playing purists in that straight from the mouth of cinematic director, Michael Morlan, this game is no longer really an RPG. Don't get me wrong, there are still RPG elements to behold, attributes, level advancement, etc. But in just in a few minutes of viewing it becomes obvious this game is in a class by itself. Action, adventure, RPG, none of these categories, individually or combined, seem to be a fitting description for this game. One thing is for sure, though, Ultima IX will look nothing like any Ultima we've seen before.<BR><BR>

The many screen shots that have filtered through for Ultima IX: Ascension have drawn conclusions from gamers that it is a Tomb Raider clone. After seeing it first hand I can safely say that couldn't be further from the truth. The world of Ascension is just that, a world.  I could only see a small part of it, but what I saw displayed evidence of a depth of gameplay that goes far beyond the gee-whiz-bang factor of most of today's highly touted games. In Ultima IX no two characters, including NPCs will look alike, clouds role lazily by as sunset approaches and the first stars begin to peak out, and objects that would be fixed in any other game can come tumbling down from the blast of a stray lightning spell. This is as close to a real functioning world as I've ever seen trapped inside a monitor.<BR><BR>

All this interactivity, though, comes at a price. We have confirmed that the minimum system requirements for this game will be a Pentium 200 and that is to just skate by. Realistically, a 266 will likely be needed, with full 3D acceleration, to truly appreciate all this game can do. On the other hand I find Origin's fall '98 release date a bit optimistic. I couldn't confirm how much of the game was done, but if there are any large bugs that cause significant setbacks I could see this game being pushed back into the Christmas season and beyond. We'll just have to hope.<BR><BR>

With the story for the game held tightly under wraps, it's still difficult for this long time Ultima fan to say if this is going to be the savior of the series or the end of Ultima as the purists (like myself) knew it. I couldn't help but be impressed with what I saw and no matter how I describe the sheer energy of the game world, it won't do it justice. But on the other hand I saw nothing in the demonstration that indicates this game truly has a sense of its roots. The story of the day seemed to be accessibility to new players and not a last Britannian dance for the Ultima veterans. Purists shouldn't give up hope, though, because with Richard Garriott taking a direct hand in the development of this game, I can't help but hope that there will be a traditional Ultima hiding behind all the new clothing.<BR><BR>

With E3 starting this week, the official Origin Ultima: Ascension webpage is due to open by Wednesday at the latest.  Its URL will be <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.ultima-ascension.com
" TARGET="_parent">http://www.ultima-ascension.com</A> when it finally opens.<BR><BR>

On a non-Ultima related point, one year from today is the opening date of the first Star Wars prequel.  I'll shortly be taking my place in line.<BR><BR>

<U>14 May 1998</U><BR><BR>

Here is Bob White's confirmation of his coming departure from Origin and the U:A team:<BR><BR>

<I>This is more of a confirmation of things already known.<BR><BR>

Just to let you know...from the horses mouth. I am leaving for Ion Storm as of the 22nd of this month. I will help the U:A team finish the development of this demo (which will be quite nice too.) and the spell code that I am writing. As of June 1, I will join the Deus Ex team at Ion Storm, Austin. As to the reasons of my departure...I will not comment on that for a while as to not inadvertently cast a shadow over a fine product and team.</I><BR><BR>

Thanks, Bob!<BR><BR>

<U>13 May 1998</U><BR><BR>

It was announced by Ion Storm today that Bob White tendered his resignation from Origin and the U:A team this past Friday, and is moving onto the <I>Deux Ex</I> team at Ion Storm Austin.  I wish him the very best of luck, and hope he takes a long vacation before going back to work.<BR><BR>

EA and Origin announced their E3 lineup today, listing all of the products that will be shown in their booth.  Here's the official write-up on U:A from <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="http://www.avault.com" TARGET="_parent">The Adrenaline Vault</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>Ultima(TM): Ascension<BR>
Ultima: Ascension is the newest chapter in Richard Garriott's legendary Ultima series. Using the latest innovative technologies, the game blurs the boundaries of reality and fantasy in an easy-to-play environment. Ultima: Ascension incorporates a brand new, ground-breaking 3-D engine that renders
a richly-detailed, visual world set in the fictional land of Ultima. It also features social interaction, magical spell effects, fantastic sounds and spectacular visuals that weave a fun and compelling story line of exciting quests, exotic locations and intriguing adventures. Available in fall 1998</I><BR><BR>

Thanks, Waterfall!<BR><BR>

<U>9 May 1998</U><BR><BR>

Ed Del Castillo let me know that the E3 demo <U>will</U> be made available a couple of weeks after the convention is over.  They want to polish it a bit more before making it available for download.  It'll also be available through magazine CD's, but the Origin publicity department has yet to make the final decisions.<BR><BR>

Thanks, Ed!<BR><BR>

<U>7 May 1998</U><BR><BR>

This month's issue of the German gaming magazine <I>PC Games</I> had a preview of Ultima: Ascension and an interview with Seth Mendelsohn, one of the game's designers:<BR><BR>

<LI>One of the major plots points involves eight giant pillars that the Guardian has constructed and that are slowly consuming Britannia.  The Avatar must find a way to stop the pillars by using the eight Virtues.<BR><BR>

<LI>The game will intially be quite linear, but becomes more and more non-linear as the game progresses and the story unfolds.<BR><BR>

<LI>The scripting for the NPC's will be very complex with each having their own daily routine, and some even traveling from city to city.<BR><BR>

<LI>There will be an equal amount of detail given to the wilderness, with butterflies flitting amongst the trees and squirrels jumping from tree to tree and running in the branches.<BR><BR>

<LI>The article also stated the game is only 35% complete.  <I>[Ed. Note: This is very hard to believe, since the game is being shown at E3 this month.]</I><BR><BR>

Thanks, Waterfall!  Thanks, Sebastian!<BR><BR>

<U>6 May 1998</U><BR><BR>

Here the letter I received from Ed Del Castillo, Producer of Ultima: Ascension, in response to my <A STYLE="text-decoration:none" HREF="timetogo.html" TARGET="content">Time to Go editorial</A>:<BR><BR>

<I>Hi Sith,<BR><BR>

I have been following your page and others (scorched, Horizons, etc.) 
for a while now, and I normally don't get involved but, In this one 
case, I feel compelled to make an exception.<BR><BR>

I read your editorial today.  It saddened me.  I did my best to put it 
aside, but it cut very deep.<BR><BR>

Since October 20th I have been lucky enough to work on the 
Ultima:Ascension team.  They are a band of hard working, devoted 
people who believe in the creation of great games.  They are tireless, 
many of us working 14 hour days, and 6 or 7 days a week. Most of this 
team has done more than one Ultima, and some have even been here for 
longer.  Herman Miller, a programmer on the team,  has been working on 
Ultimas for 10 years, and Gary Smith has been here for 7, working on 
anything Ultima since his arrival.  These are the people who have 
delivered you the Ultimas that you have loved over the years, and 
these are the first people you hurt with your editorial.  There are 
about 20 people on this team right now, and they're all working very 
hard to make something that we can all be proud of.  Unfortunately 
we've been doing it under a rain of stones from our "fans".  Each of 
them sees or hears about all the internet traffic, and it only brings 
them down.<BR><BR>

Its like the Ascension team is a boat, trying to take millions of 
people to a very cool, fun place, yet all the "hardcore fans" are down 
in the boiler room blowing holes in the hull with their shotguns.  Its 
very easy to be critical without knowing all the facts, and its very 
easy to rally around the bitter few because they speak the loudest. 
Hardcore Fans don't slander their idols.  Sports fans don't "boo" 
their team.  This is the only industry where the "fans" bitterly and 
caustically attack their own teams.<BR><BR>

For myself, I understand that there is always criticism of the new. 
People don't like change, it scares them.  No one believed in "Siege" 
when I was working on that, and they certainly didn't believe in 
"Command & Conquer" during its creation.  This is more for the team 
really.  All of the nay-sayers have left the building, and the team is 
happy about it.  They just want to feel that what they are working on 
is being eagerly anticipated.<BR><BR>

Ultimas are not about stick men and baking bread (even though I saw a 
flame that said that that is exactly what Ultimas were about)  Ultimas 
are about using the computer as a tool to enhance the fantasy 
experience.  To take away the clumsy dice, slow charts, and paper and 
give you wonderful gameplay instead.  They were never meant to mimic 
paper RPG's, they were meant to exceed them.<BR><BR>

In alot of ways its been very hard for me and the team to try and make 
a really cool game with nothing but criticism from the fans.  What we 
really need is your support.<BR><BR>

<U>5 May 1998</U><BR><BR>

This isn't exactly a piece of U:A news, but I felt it belongs on this page anyway:<BR><BR>

On Saturday, 2 May, I decided that I was going to pull the plug on this page.  My support of Ultima: Ascension and for Ultima in general had, up until that point, been nearly unconditional.  For various reasons, however, I had come to feel that that support was unjustified and that the time I put into this page would be better spent elsewhere.<BR><BR>

In the handful of days since Saturday I have been completely overwhealmed by the amount of e-mail I have received stating what while my action was supported the reporting of the U:A news should continue.  
When so many people tell me the same thing (4,076 people as of 10:12 AM this morning) I have no choice but to consider the possibility that I might have acted too rashly.<BR><BR>

However, there was one letter in particular that convinced me that I was too hasty in turning my back on U:A.  It was polite and reasoned when a vicious flame really would have been called for, and clearly and simply made its case to me.  I'm going to post the letter as soon as I get the permission of the writer.<BR><BR>

Going forward, am I going to be able to continue to give U:A unconditional support?  No.  This is going to be reflected by some changes of format on my page.  I can, however, give U:A and the U:A team my support for as long as I feel that their focus is on making U:A truly the epic finale that the series deserves.  Origin has placed a lot of hurdles in their way to making U:A the Ultima that the fans have been waiting for, but I'm more than willing to eat crow if Origin can prove me wrong.<BR><BR><BR>
