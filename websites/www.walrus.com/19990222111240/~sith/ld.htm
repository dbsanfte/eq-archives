I make my living as the Network Administrator for a multinational public relations firm based in New York.  My employer is not only vastly larger than any I have worked for in the past, but is also much more focused on technology and education than any I have heard of.<BR><BR>

Previously having worked in trade book publishing my entire career, I feel that I am justified in saying the publishing is not a career -- it's a hobby.  Unless you are comfortable subsidizing your interest in publishing with its ridiculously low salaries I cannot recommend a career in publishing with a clear conscience.<BR><BR>

Working for an employer whose focus is on improving the skills of its employees is actually a new experience for me, and has allowed me to begin work on something that I've been wanting to pursue for quite some time:  certification as a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer.  I've decided upon the standard MCSE NT 4.0 Track, and have begun preparing for the Networking Essentials Exam (70-058).  I'm estimating about one month's time preparation for each of the six tests, and hope to achieve my certification by February or March 1999 by the latest.<BR><BR>

Mrs. Sith has finally given me the go-ahead to order my new computer, and because it's the year's end she's letting me go hogwild in order for some nice tax deductions:  P2-450, 128mb, 12.1 gig hd, Righteous 3D II SLI, SoundBlaster Live with Cambridge Speakers.  If U:A doesn't fly on this baby I'm going to cry.<br><br>

Here are the games I've been playing lately:<br><br>

<LI>Age of Empires -- I picked this one up after really being blown away by the demo and I have to say that I remain impressed by the game.  Most RTS games seem to have the weakness of being winnable by the tank rush mentality, but AOE really does force you to approach each scenario differently.  It's vexing at times but a nice change of pace.<br><br>

<LI>Blood 2 Demo -- For some reason the original Blood struck a soft spot in me, so it was with quite a bit of excitement that I downloaded the Blood 2 demo.  Sadly, I must say that I'm left completely underwhelmed by what I saw.  The LithTech engine does look nice (even though it's quite slow on my P200), but it just doesn't make up for the fact that the game doesn't try anything new or adds anything to a rapidly-tiring genre.  Run and shoot and push a button was great when the genre was just flexing its muscles, but it's old-hat at this point.<br><br>
