"Ask and ye shall receive." -- I can honestly say that I never imagined that the day would come when I could link that aphorism and Origin in the same thought without irony.<BR><BR>  

After years of détente between OSI and the Ultima fanbase the landscape has suddenly shifted beneath our feet.  Where once I could opine that we were routinely ignored or treated with suspicion I now find myself in the happy position of having to reassess (if not retract) many of the things I've said about Origin in the past.<BR><BR>

Lady Moi is, without doubt, the greatest sea-change that has occurred within Origin in all the years that I've followed them and their games.  With her effervescent charm she has almost-singlehandedly given an appealing facet to a company that once had all the openness and warmth of the Black Gate.  In the last two months I can honestly say that many, if not all, of my past criticisms have either been resolved or a plan is in-place to address them in the near future.<BR><BR>

Communication:<BR><BR>

The silence that I once claimed was costing Origin dearly has now been broken.  This is the most positive step that Origin could have made to regain the trust of the fanbase - regardless of the fact that what Origin has to say isn't always what the fans want to hear.  It is also to Lady Moi's credit that the signal-to-noise ratio is high and on-topic.<BR><BR> 

As a fan, what I would like to see, and I suspect that this is the eventual plan, is the removal of any intermediary between the U:A team and the rest of us.  The ongoing development of the official U:A discussion boards is definitely a step in the right direction as long as there is a strong Origin presence on them, but I think a good supplement would also be to develop a fingering service as well.<BR><BR>

Knowing that an open and honest relationship exists between the two halves of the Ultima equation is the cornerstone, I believe, in helping to rebuild a community that has been for too long divided and disillusioned.<BR><BR>

Screenshots:<BR><BR>

This is an area where Origin has definitely improved, but there still is a way to go.  A fine line exists between when screenshots can whet an appetite and when they can kill it, but I feel there's quite a bit of latitude in U:A's case given its radical departure from the rest of the Ultima series.<BR><BR>  

A way that I think it would be possible to avoid overkill while providing screenshots on a regular basis would be to distribute content-driven screenshots showing the parts of the game that have become controversial.  The most recent screenshot of the Avatar's backpack is the perfect example in that it shows us how the slotted inventory system will work while still showing off how visually stunning the game will be.  If Origin applied this to the conversation system, the paperdoll, the magic system, and combat they could satisfy both the fan's desire for something new to look at while possibly calming the fears of others.<BR><BR>

Another way to improve the quality of the screenshots would be to generate shots showing the Avatar in a living, breathing Britannia.  In the past, the screenshots we've seen have been both pretty and picturesque but have been amazingly free of life other than the Avatar.  Showing us a rich and vibrant Britannia will go a long way in helping U:A to rebuild its connection to the past Ultimas in the minds of the gaming public.<BR><BR>

Going Forward:<BR><BR>     

In addition to the above I cannot overemphasize the importance of communicating how U:A is going to be a worthy successor (and finale) to the classic Ultima series.  Showing that U:A is as much about the storytelling as it is about the presentation need not involve spoilers or discussion of the plot itself.  Telling us that the design document is X pages long, the script for each town is Y pages long, or that the conversations are Z pages long will garner the game much more interest in the fanbase than trying to boggle the mind with polygon counts and real-time lightsourcing.<BR><BR>

Origin has done an admirable job in moving into an area in which it has been historically weak.  With no real precedent to base its present communication program on I think that Lady Moi has been able to come up with a plan that should satisfy most if not all.<BR><BR>

With roughly half a year to go before the game is due to appear on the shelves there is little time left for Origin to rebuild bridges long since dynamited, but there might be time enough given the ground they've already regained.<BR><BR>
