Origin, U:A, and the Cost of Silence</FONT></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="bar2.jpg"></CENTER><BR>

Since its inception, standard business practice at Origin has been to keep as tight a lid on current Ultima development as possible.  Each morsel of information was carefully doled out to select publicity outlets, and before the advent of the web, fan sites such as my own, and the game-playing public's thirst for continuous information, this scenario worked well.  Unfortunately, what was once standard business practice became dogma and was applied without thought as to whether or not it was in the best interests of the company, the product, or the fans.<BR><BR>

In the past, when the gaming community's only sources of information were print magazines, the slower pace of information exchange worked to Origin's favor; if a reluctance to engage their fanbase existed on Origin's part both the glacial editorial process and the monthly publication cycle helped to disguise it.  However, times have changed, and caution is readily identifiable and interpreted more often than not as disregard for the game-buying public.  Shackled by a set of rigid business practices Origin cannot help but to undermine its own product while at the same time inadvertently alienating the audience for it.<BR><BR>

All one needs to do is listen to the discussion surrounding U:A or read the latest news to realize what an utter failure Origin's policy of silence has become. Instead of discussions on the length of the script or the number of cities or the depth of the plot all that we can discuss are things that should have never left Origin's human resource office.   In a turn of events strikingly similar to Derek Smart's Battlecruiser 3000AD, U:A's attraction is rapidly becoming due to its soap operatic and never-ending development cycle rather than any value in the game itself.  Sadly, Origin and Lord British have no one to blame for this but themselves.<BR><BR>

If there is any one factor that will bring about the success or failure of U:A I feel it will be the way that Origin chooses to engage the Internet community.  A Baldur's Gate webmaster enjoys a good chance of hearing from Bioware's president himself.  A Quake III webmaster contends with a near-continuous flow of information from id. A Deus Ex webmaster can communicate directly with the designers themselves.  However, I chose a long time ago to run an Ultima: Ascension page, so I don't have to worry about any of those things.<BR><BR> 

I feel that the time has come for Origin to embrace the online community as partners in U:A's success.  The recent shifts in the development team should mark a break with the past, and Origin and U:A should move forward with the fanbase as a compliment to game rather than an impediment to it.  By breaking its own rules Origin has the opportunity to mend fences long neglected and once again raise a once-great series of games above the level of mudslinging and ridicule.<BR><BR>
