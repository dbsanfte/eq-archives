<B>2.4 <U>The Guardian Trilogy so far.</U></B><BR><BR>

In  Ultima VII -- The Black Gate,  The  Avatar  is summoned to Britannia and uncovers The Guardian's plans to gain control of the world with Batlin's help. Naturally The Avatar foils The Guardian's plans and Batlin flees Britannia.<BR><BR>

In  Ultima  Underworld 2 -- The Labyrinth  of  Worlds, The Guardian makes another attempt on Britannia by encasing The Avatar and Lord  British's castle within a  dome of blackrock. The Avatar travels to other Guardian-dominated worlds to gain the power necessary to free the castle.<BR><BR>

In  Ultima  VII, Part Two -- Serpent  Isle,  The Avatar follows the trail  Batlin  has set to  the  Serpent  Isle.  The  Avatar discovers a land on the verge of destruction from the forces of Imbalance. In restoring Balance to Serpent Isle, The Avatar falls into The Guardian's trap.<BR><BR>

In  Ultima VIII -- Pagan, The Guardian banishes The Avatar to the world of  Pagan.  There,  the  Avatar  seeks  a  way  home to Britannia.<BR><BR>

<B>2.5 <U>The Official Ultima VIII -Pagan End Sequence</U></B><BR><BR>

From  the  five blackrock fragments,  The  Avatar recreates the Blackrock  Obelisk  of  the Great  Temple.  The pyramid shaped obelisk  is a black gate which takes The Avatar into the Nexus of  the  Worlds -- the place with the white pillars. Upon entering the  Nexus, a person is taken to where they most desire to go.<BR><BR>

The  Avatar  is  taken  back  to  Britannia,  where he appears wearing the suit of the Titan of Ether.  However, Britannia is unlike the one we remember. The sky is blood red, rivers of molten lava flow across the land and dragons swoop about in the sky. The Guardian's head is carved into a mountain.<BR><BR>

The end of U8 didn't show the time you spent on Earth, between Pagan and Britannia, "but trust me, you did." Then you will arrive in Britannia, with the same scene from the end of U8. Further commentary on continuity: "Quick, look over there!" Heh.. it was funny when RG did it to me. -shrug-<BR><BR>

<B>2.5.1 <U>Has the Guardian conquered Britannia?</U></B><BR><BR>

Presumably yes, but we'll have to play the game to discover how far his power extends.
