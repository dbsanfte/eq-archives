      Morin Shadowbane says 'Hail Selline. I am
      the leader of this beleaguered troop of rangers.
      Even though the once fair Kithicor slowly
      succumbs to the [<FONT color="#ff3333">darkness</FONT>] at hand, we shall not abandon the woods
      without a fight. <BR>

      Morin Shadowbane says 'The denizens of these
      woods are slowly being overrun by dark fiends
      and shadowed men. As valiantly as we have
      fought, our numbers dwindle. We know very
      little about our aggressors, but if we [<FONT color="#ff3333">acquire some information</FONT>] or perhaps [<FONT color="#ff3333">fine weapons</FONT>], then we may yet have a chance to retake
      the woods once more. <BR>

      You say, 'what is <FONT color="#ff3333">fine weapons</FONT> ?'<BR>
      <BR>
      Morin Shadowbane says 'My soldiers are valiant,
      but poorly equipped. I have heard of a magical
      weapon of great power, some call it the Ebony
      Blade. Amongst the Froglocks there can be
      found a Minotaur who wields this sword of
      might. If you are a ranger and could provide
      me with this sword then I would gladly exchange
      it with my own meager weapon. If you prefer,
      you may attempt to [<FONT color="#ff3333">acquire some information</FONT>] for us instead. <BR>

      <BR>
      Morin Shadowbane says 'Your tracking skills
      are invaluable to our cause, brave Selline.
      Our scouts have reported of a Ghoul Messenger.
      They have spotted him traveling between Kithicor
      and an undead camp in the Plains of Karana.
      They have attempted to track the monster
      and obtain any Strategic Documentation he
      may be carrying. Perhaps you can succeed
      where others have failed. Perhaps you can
      earn my personal short sword. <BR>

      woods found themselves nothing more than
      moving targets for Maldyn's training. We
      held a trial and exiled him to parts unknown.
