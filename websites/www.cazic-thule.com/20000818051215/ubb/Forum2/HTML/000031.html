</FONT><HR>Leizav stepped off the docks of Butcher Block, and nodded in mock honor to a Feir'Dal paladin nearby. What does the bastard son of a whore and a priest of Innoruuk really know about honor anyway. Taught to steal, lie and murder by one and disciplined in the ways of hate by the other. Too bad they both discovered just a bit to late how well they had taught the son. Leizav shuddered, that was a cold chapter in his life, better to not remember the screams of his "loved" ones.<P>Passing by the simple minded paladin who was decieved by the palty high elf form Leizav wore, he stepped onto the orange sand right off the beach of the Ocean of Tears.<P>Leizav despised this continent of Norrath above all others. It was here he was trapped and made to bend to the will of another. Walking past the towering stone walls of the shipyard he passed several cheerful dwarven guards. Of all the races on Norrath, Leizav actually admired the dwarfs for their hot tempers. He felt bad for the dwarves themselves though..minds clouded by the thoughts and wills of "good" gods. <P>On through the mountians he walked, sometime near when day filtered to night he let his illusion drop. As Leizav approached the forest of Fay, he felt the day shift completely to night more quickly than it should. A crackling in the air behind him and a heat intense enough to be the very sun told him he was no longer alone.<P>Behind him stood a figure cloaked in a robe of bonechilled spider silk, with eyes that burned fiery green. "Greetings Leizav, my...father...He called you into his service I believe." Leizav was at once chilled and burned by the voice that spoke. It rasped like burnt bones dragged across a stone crypt floor, yet was shrill, constant. strong, and made him shiver. This...thing..before him was not mortal.<P>"Of course I am mortal" the figure spoke, pulling the words from the enchanter's mind. "I'm just not mortal in a way you'd comprehend, but besides that, you are here for my Ilharn's bidding, correct?"<P>Visibly shaken by this creatures words, Leizav questioned "You are the wraithe Vaziel then, son of Mayong the vile lord of Mistmoore." The figure hardened, then let out a brief chuckle. "Word of who I am has reached Neriak then I see, it's of no consequence though. Yes, I am Vaziel the "wraithe"" at this he chuckled again "and have you any doubt I am HIS son?"<P>"No, no " stammerd the enchanter,trying not to look at the odd entrancing eyes on the robe of his counterpart "I was simply making sure" he responded quickly.<P>"Very well, enough prattle, I am here to "fetch" you as it were" Vaziel cleared his throat and began to speak the words of magic. In the next instant the enchanter and wizard(for thats what he appeared to be) were in a great hall, lined with beautiful statues of historic heros long since dead. Shadows flitted in and out of the dark corners of the old place. It smelled of death, old and long forgotten.<P>The wizard stepped forward, cleared his throat and spoke in a voice tinged with not a small amount of fear, "Father..I have done your bidding and brought unto you the young enchanter who you caught here in guise weeks ago." Leizav cringed at that, he remembered when his illusion had dropped at the whim of the vampire lord as he was searching for treasure. THere were few people in Norrath Leizav feared, this odd wizard and his father were definatly two of them.<P>A voice like booming thunder in the darkest hours of the night spoke, "Leizav..Elgg'Del'Khaless, slayer of his very parents, I, Lord Mayong Mistmoore, have a "request" you will fulfill for me...In the westernmost part of Norrath there is a tomb of a city, overrun by devils and elementals. Here you will find two imps, these two are favored by the dark gods of Norrath. I require from them each a drop of blood. No more than that." Leizav was at once put off guard by the voice which came from everywhere in the hall, yet no where. He responded weekly "I am but a lonely enchanter, my spells are powerful, true, but how am I to..." he stopped abruptly as the very shadows of the room took shape to form an elven figure, that of Mayong. The wizard lowered his head, walked over and took his place beside his father's right side. "You will go to the city of Freeport, there you will gather with you a band of travelers to aid you in your quest. Do not let them know of the true reasons you make your way there." spoke the lord, "and you..my son will watch over him until the business is finished." The vampire cast a glance at the wizard who nodded to an unspoken command. "Leave now, and do not fail me..." At that the air became chilled and the vampire faded in the darkness as he faded so the heat returned to the hall.<P>The wizard walked up to stand in front of the enchanter. "Know this elf...I have my own agenda, looking after it involves you..for now." As he finished his words his eye began glow an fiery red.<P>Leizav awoke in the early morning to the sounds of the water front, children playing, men shouting commands in gruff voices. He stood from the bed he woke in and walked to the window...ahh Freeport he thought, what a strange dream...<BR>"Twas no dream enchanter" came that voice from a dark corner in the room "and so you don't think it is again, I give you this "gift"" the wizard rambled off sacred words of magic and Leizav's arm began to tingle. Seconds lately the wizard was gone with the haunting voice trailing into the ether saying "I am watching you Leizav, do not fail my father......"<BR>Shaken, Leizav looks to his arm and finds a black rose seared into his flesh. The revenant Vaziel's own crest.<BR>Leizav turns to the window musing over what has just transpired. "Well, I guess, Norrath for me has just gotten a bit more interesting...."<P>------------------<BR>Swift death comes not from the enemy...but the trusted friend...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#696158">

</FONT><HR>The long twilight sun swept across the front of the castle keep. It was morning now for the wizard known as Vaziel. Occasionally he would wake up very early and enjoy the day's sunshine, but those times were becoming fewer and more far between. The hours kept by his father prevented him from wasting too much of his waking time gawking at such things as the simple sunlight.<P>This night was different. His father had givin him command to gather a young enchanter who Vaziel had caught snooping the castle grounds earlier in the year and bring him from the Butcher Block mountains to his fathers court.<P>The wizard suspected something was amiss the day before when he noticed his father, the vampire lord Mayong staring intently at him while the wizard was studying his spellbook. A conversation had taken place when the wizard closed his book and rose to leave. "Did I dismiss you from my presence son?" Mayong thundered. "No, you did not father, I merely took your stare to mean you wished to be left alone" the wizard replied, visibly shaken. The vampire waved his hand at his son in apology, he had quite the temper, especially with things concerning his son.<BR> <BR>Mayong had been cheated by the god Solusek, his offspring, Vaziel, had his life essence stolen and replaced with that of Solusek Ro's. Forever changing the young would be powerful necromancer son of his into a raw controller of the elements known to many as a wizard.<P>Tonight his father seemed agitated though by the wizard. Vaziel had heard the story of Solusek many times and had even fallen victim to his father's rage once or twice barely surviving the beatings he endured. Fearing this was the case, another re-telling of the story, he made his move to the door of his father's study.<P>"I know how to redeem you" came his father's voice just as he reached the door. Vaziel froze, fearing that by redemption his father meant the son's usefulness had ended and his life was forfeit. He awaited the inevitable words that would pass from his father's lip banishing Vaziel to whatever hell or plane his father sent his creations to.<P>"I don't know if I could banish you like so many of those fledglings you've witnessed" said reading his son's mind "and I don't wish that at all. I fear for you my son, These past 20 years I've seen your elven form age. Although slower than others, you will still feel the touch of death." the vampire paused. "Although attempting to turn you into what I am would not work, I have learned there exists on Norrath another type of unliving creature. The problem is that the place they dwell in his holy ground. Neither you nor I could go there. I would use the old dwarf for this, but you did right in destroying him in the caverns of Permafrost for falling prey to the Ring of Scale." The vampire mused on this thought for a bit. "Know this though son, not only do I require these creatures for you, but for a "friend" of mine also who grows weak with age and undeath. Find me that young enchanter, the one soulbound to me for his trepasses here, send him his summons to my court."<P>"As you command my father" was all Vaziel could say, when he first rejoined his father he would have dared quetioning, but he had learned that fate proved to be most informative.<P>So here he was, awoken early in the evening by the gypsies who guarded the keep during the day. Supposed to "fetch" this enchanter for his father. Thoughts buzzed right and left in his brain. What is this thing his father wanted him to become, and who was his father's "friend". Again, the thought came to him...time will tell...<P>Porting himself to the Butcher Block mountains Vaziel followed the Teir'Dal in Feir'Dal form for a few minutes, then let his presence be known with an interesting new spell his father had givin him. Oddly all the spells his father gave him worked slightly differently for the son, this spell was designed to chill those in the effect area to the bone, for the wizard it acted as a blast furnace to all in the effect, but with no physical damage, such was the touch of Solusek Ro..<P>He greeted the young enchanter, and learned that Neriak did indeed know who he really was now. With a few words he ported them away to his father's great hall. There his father commissioned the enchanter with the task of retrieving the blood from undead devilish imps in the ruins of the Erudite capital. Also, not a surprise to the wizard he was picked to oversee the endeavor personally. After taking the enchanter to Freeport and reminding him(somewhat painfully) the stakes, the wizard did not for the first time in 20 years return to his father's home, but instead visited a Neriak inn as an unknown wizard, member of the spurned. He sent out letters to the friends he needed to see again, a druid with a kindred heart as dark as the wizard's own, a polite reaver of Innoruuk, and a mercenary warrior to name a few and spread no word of his arrival to enemies who would get some surprise visits.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Lady Vox love toy,<BR>Who drive car?!?!<BR>Vaziel Oloth'Colbauth<BR>Imperia Discordia<BR>"Of course I'm an idiot..Did I ever claim otherwise?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#615850">

</FONT><HR>	Shallondra sat quietly in the inn, sipping her tea, journaling the day’s events, paying little mind to the help shuffling around her.  The candles on each table flickered softly, illuminating the room in a soft glow as the sunlight of the day retreated.  A sigh escaped her.  It was late.  Her benefactor in the temple would not be pleased, should she realize Shallondra was out so late and not meditating in her bedchamber.<P>	Again, as many nights of late, she swore quietly to herself. Why was she trapped inside the stifling walls of the temple?  She never understood how she came to be there.  No one would tell her anything.  When she asked she was reprimanded thoroughly and completely for voicing anything near the subject.  She learned years ago that it was a line of questioning that was not allowed.  Always, she wondered why.  It was a hole in her history that would remain unanswered, she knew.<P>	The door swung open quietly, followed by a cold breeze.  Shallondra shivered and looked up.  A robed figure stood in the doorway briefly, and then silently moved into the shadows of the room.  Quickly she looked away.  The breeze from the open doorway carried the smell of magics and herbs.  This same figure had shown at almost the same time each night in recent days.  Always moving to the same corner of the inn, followed by two, sometimes three others close behind.  Many nights she felt the urgency to leave and return to the temple, before she was missed.  Tonight, she paused for a bit longer.  The robed stranger intrigued her young mind and sense of adventure.  Who was he?<P>	Shallondra looked blankly at the pages of her journal.  Why did he come each night?  Somehow she knew there was a mystery and danger about him.  She turned slowly to spy him out of the corner of her eyes.  The barmaid was setting a refreshment in front of the robed stranger, blocking her inquisitive eyes.  The barmaid moved away and she found herself being regarded through narrowed, cold eyes, glinting menacingly from the candlelight on the table.<P>	Shallondra turned around abruptly.  The shackles rose on her neck and her cheeks flushed in embarrassment.  How horrifying!  He’d caught her.  She could feel his eyes on her still, even with her back turned.  Shivering, she gathered her things, shoving her journal into her bag quickly and scurried out the door.  She ran down the back street towards the temple quickly, then stopped around the next corner and took a deep breath.<P>	Silly girl!  She thought to herself.  What is wrong with you?  Shallondra sighed.  She must be losing her mind.  She heard the night birds singing their farewell songs for the eve.<P>	“Oh dear… it’s late, the mistress will surely take a whip to my back this time!”  Shallondra swore at herself for getting carried away in idle fantasies.  She hurriedly ran off towards the temple of the God of Hate, Innoruuk.<P><BR>------------------<BR>Shallondra Bel'la<BR>Soul Caller, Myrkul's Prophet<BR>Undead Lords<P>"Know thy role."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#696158">

</FONT><HR>A week or so had passed since his father's command, Vaziel had watched with interest the young enchanter as he set out from Freeport with at least one companion in tow. The next stop for the young enchanter was Neriak. Here the enchanter was having difficulty raising a band of travelers, as the Teir'Dal all demanded to know the true purpose of his quest, which of course he could not tell. The wizard himself still awaited return of messages from trusted companions of him.<P>Ever reminding the enchanter of the quest and that he was being vigilant, Vaziel would materialize every other day as the enchanter awoke and the wizard prepared for his slumber. Occasionally they would speak, other times the enchanter would simply plead that he was trying his best.<P>Vaziel had time...the enchanter however did not.<P>During the time while Vaziel waited he frequented an inn known as the Blind Fish. He had busied himself by bringing the agents of Mistmoore who had fallen in disfavor with his father here. He thought it appropriate to buy them a drink or meal before they last breathed Norrath air. On one of these occasions, he had noticed a beautiful young priestess begin to take an interest in him. He had seen her here more than once, and even caught her gazing at him intently at one point. She was strangly powerful for one so young, for whether she knew it or not, she kept her thoughts from him. Few possessed this ability and most had to work at it, the wizard knew many tricks of the mind, some of those who he called friends had learned how to escape his mental scrutiny after years of his company. Frustrating as this was, he knew it mattered not, as these were people he placed his trust in. This young cleric however, was different. What if she could read my thoughts came a horrifying thought. No, the wizard decided relaxing a bit, she appeared much to comfortable to be delving through the depths of the wizard's mind. Things stored in his memory would drive an ordinary mortal mad. Sights he had seen, atrocities he had witnessed recently, which were fresh in his mind from his stay with his father.<P>Intriqued by her he would follow her to the temple grounds, only to be held back in his pursuit by the hallowed ground. Perplexed by the the cleric that haunted his daytime slumber, the wizard made a desicion to greet this young one and learn who she was and were she was from, and not un-importantly why her thoughts were veiled from him. Was it the work of Innoruuk, who even though the wizard pledged no allegiance to, he was a puppet of none the less.<P>Waking much earlier than his usual sundown, revenants can walk the day altough their blood much prefers the night, he donned his red training robes, those that denote an apprentice of the spurned, made his way to the inn and sat much nearer her table in the lighted area of the inn. He waited there for her, confident she would come soon, as it seemed her custom to have a drink before retiring. He ordered a warm elven wine, not to drink...he never drank, but he would hold it in his hand and feel the warmth die from it. <P>Here he would wait. <P>------------------<BR>Lady Vox love toy,<BR>Who drive car?!?!<BR>Vaziel Oloth'Colbauth<BR>Imperia Discordia<BR>"Of course I'm an idiot..Did I ever claim otherwise?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#615850">

</FONT><HR>The note had been delivered in typical Neriak style, by bribing an off-duty member of the Indigo Brotherhood to play errand-boy.  Nodding his thanks with impassive features, the knight tossed a pouch of plat toward the ill-bred warrior and waited until the hulking brute wandered away to spend both this coin and his stamina in the loving and well seasoned embrace of Mare X'Lottl.<P>While occasionally a useful tool and effective fodder for the intrigues and conspiracies constantly seething in the city of his birth, the members of the Indigo Brotherhood were little more than paid thugs.  He had scant respect for them, save a few individuals who had the misfortune of being born in too low a caste and thus prevented from serving the city in a more honorable fashion.  Still, their constant fascination with drink and rutting made them easily bribed to run trivial errands.<P>Done musing over the nature of the errand boy, Noamu'Chath turned his gaze to the fine scroll.  Murmuring the incantation that would cancel any lingering magic and any unpleasant traps, he waited until he felt the surge of magic flow through him before he snapped the nondescript wax seal and unrolled the fine soft skin.<P>Reading quickly the coded phrases inscribed in spidery script, he smiled grimly and then rerolled the scroll neatly, admiring the way that the halfling tottler's skin had been so elegantly tanned to provide such a supple and smooth surface for writing.  Tucking the hide into his belt with a quickly hidden grin, he strode toward the Third Gate and the Lodge of the Dead for a discussion with his liege lord.<P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#696158">

</FONT><HR>Shallondra looked out the window at the blazing orb in the sky, assessing its place.  She closed her eyes briefly, feeling the warmth of the sunlight on her face.  It would be a warm evening, she thought to herself.  She looked down at the moat surrounding the temple.  Her eyes narrowed.  Trapped.  She smiled grimly.  They could not hold her spirit anymore with physical restrictions.  She even felt that her benefactor knew of her escaping in the afternoon, and said nothing.  Somehow, the high priestess knew Shallondra did not belong within the temple’s walls.  Her spirit would not allow itself to be slaved.<P>Taking a deep breath, she looked behind her at the journal lying on her bag.  It was a bit early to sneak out.  Smiling mischievously, she threw her journal into her bag, slipped out of her room and down the hallway, cautious to remain in the shadows.<P>Laughing as the temple receded in the background, Shallondra ran down the back streets of Neriak, eyes already searching for the inn she liked to sit in and journal.  She liked the Blind Fish very much, mostly because the help there said nothing about whomever choose to frequent the establishment.  No questions, this is what she needed to protect her haven.  This was the one place she could truly relax now, be herself.  The temple was stifling.<P>Shallondra rounded the corner and approached the entrance of the inn.  Suddenly she stopped, gazing at the door, feeling a dark presence inside.  Her breath caught in her throat.  He was there.  The arcane wizard was already there.  She could feel it, a cold shiver passed through her.  He was early, almost two hours early.  Why?<P>Taking a deep breath, she approached the door, her senses heightened at the presence of this powerful one.  He was very powerful, this too she could feel.  How, she did not know, oft she had the ability to sense danger around her.  Did this mean she was in danger?  One way to find out.<P>Shallondra pushed the door open just enough for her to slip inside.  The door swung shut behind her.  She looked around briefly; she did not see the intriguing stranger.  Sniffing in disgust at her foolishness, she moved further in to the dim room towards the table she normally choose to sit at during her time there.  She glanced at the barmaid and motioned her to bring her drink.  The help knew her now, needing not to ask what it is she wished.  She pulled out the chair, expecting to see the barmaid place the drink in front of her.<P>Frowning, Shallondra looked up just in time to see her tea set in front of the shadowed figure in the corner.  Opening her mouth to object and thrash the girl for the mistake, the words fell short.  There he was.  The air from the room seemed to be sucked away, she could not breath.  He was waiting on her arrival.  Why?  The question echoed in her mind.<P>Slowly, the robed figure leaned forward, so the light from the nearby window illuminated his face.  Gaunt.  Almost death.  Afraid, yet enthralled at the same time, Shallondra stepped forward.  Her eyes locked on his, captured, she wanted to look away but was at once unable to.<P>Gathering her courage, she bowed respectfully and murmured, “My apologies, master, the wench made a mistake with my refreshment.”<P>His eyes narrowed a bit, and then he smirked.  “No mistake, yathrin.  I wish you to join me.”  He deftly waved his hand, indicating she sit at his table, where her drink had been placed.<P>Shallondra swallowed.  She could not refuse, do that and she would appear rude.  She moved to the chair, sat and said, “Thank you, you are kind.”<P>His eyes remained locked on hers for a moment in silence, then he asked, leaning forward a bit, “What is your name?”<P>Shallondra looked away for a moment, confused, wondering why he was asking.  Perhaps he would report her transgressions to the temple.  She looked up again, seeing him watching her again, waiting for her answer.  No reason to fabricate a story, she thought, he already knew she came here in the late afternoons and probably more.  Instinct told her that.<P>Taking a deep breath, she replied, “I am Shallondra Bel’la, master.”<P><BR>------------------<BR>Shallondra Bel'la<BR>Soul Caller, Myrkul's Prophet<BR>Undead Lords<P>"Know thy role."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#615850">

</FONT><HR>As Knok sat in the inn, drinking his ale, as he has for the past years in excess, a traveller came into the bar. Knok sat in his designated table and watched as the traveller began asking the barkeep questions. Intrigued by the wanderer Knok listened attentively. At last the traveller left and Knok was still very curious, but his curiosity came and went as his sanity. <BR><br><BR>Knok was a self loathing bastard child of a necromancer. He often thought about his past, his future which seemed to be bright. He was a young Teir'Dal with courage and a flair for adventuring, but his roots or lack thereof soon overcame the Magician. He chose the path of summoner of the arcane arts in spite of his mother, who wished the child to continue in her necromancy. He always enjoyed controlling the conjurations of his. He soon became adept at the art, often summoning things as a child to impress his young friends. He ran away from his home at a very young age and soon traversed Norrath to seek his fate. Gaining in power he often would return to Neriak only to talk with his master, then soon leave with disgust as he thought of his heritage. All was going well, until Knok suddenly felt a pulling or tugging inside of him. He had an urge to return to his home, to find his roots. This reawakening inside of Knok bound him to return to his mother whom he left so long ago.<BR><br><BR>Upon returning to Neriak he learned that his mother had passed and that she did so in deep depression. For there were rumors that she had had two children, and neither of them recognized their mother. A grief stricken old necromancer woman who passed away with no family. This thought has haunted Knok for the past two years. And during this time he had not left Neriak, he just sat and drank, and waded in his self-pity. This once promising young Mage, had become a babbling drunk. Many believed he blamed the death of his mother on himself, and carried this burden, and drank to remove himself from the truth.  <BR><br><BR>This traveller however had brought Knok out of his drunken stupor, he couldn't explain it, but he felt that this nomad was somehow important in his search for his heritage. He soon got up from his table and asked the barkeep who the man was. At this the barkeep responded "A foolish man, who is seeking men for a quest, however he won't explain himself, so no one will listen to him." Interested Knok returned to his table.<P>------------------<BR>-Knok<BR>Mage of the 30th Tier</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#696158">

</FONT><HR>The shadowknight bowed deeply murmuring his understanding and obesiance to his lord, before backing his way out of the private audience chamber.  Closing the door with a gentle click, he glanced at the somber guardian who stood watch over the passageway.  The guard's faithful skeletal companion, eyes burning crimson with hatred, lingered nearby.  With a nod of greeting to his brother in Hate, Noamu'Chath strode purposefully through the hallways toward his destination.<P>The very air within the Lodge of the Dead seemed sullen, watchful as he made his way toward the quartermaster.  The stained walls of the vast building could tell the tale of many a betrayal if only they could speak in words men understood.  For the members of the lodge served the Queen herself, unwaveringly in the silent and deadly struggles for control of the City.  The sacred art of the necromancers brought the blessings of the Father of Hate himself upon their cause, while the dedication of the warrior-mages, the Shadow Knights enforced the will of Christianos.<P>Reaching at last the office of the master of supplies, he handed over an elaborately engraved bronze token.  In return he was given a journey pack and the appropriate supplies for a foray into the wilderness.  No questions were asked, no answers were offered.  The token spoke volumes of the support behind this mission.<P>Hefting the bag to his shoulder, Noamu'Chath made his way toward the small private chapel that served the knight's quarter of the Lodge.  A single soft luminescense filled the room, illuminating the solid walls with a faint blue glow.  Removing his helmet, the Shadow Knight knelt, bowing his head in prayer before the altar of Innoruuk.<P>Some time later, his devotions completed, he made his way toward the seedy tavern near the vaults in the Common quarter.  He'd tossed a simple grey cloak over his shoulders to partially hide the jet black platemail from casual sight.  The Blind Fish the place was called, though whether this was in comic expectation of the effects of the alcohols served within, or a tribute to the huge glass panels that looked out into the moat upon the fish, was unknown.  Pressing through the door into the quiet chamber he nodded once to the barmaid on the top floor and then clambered down the stairs to the lower level.<P>Pretending fascination with the windows, he paused using the reflection in the glass to scan the room and identify any other inhabitants.  One table was occupied with several common laborers swigging ales at an alarming rate.  A drunken man muttered and mumbled at his perch near the wall.  Several tables were unoccupied save the one in the darkest corner.  There a hooded figure and a female were engaged in some conversation, a kettle of tea resting neatly nearby.<P><P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#615850">

</FONT><HR>"Shallondra Bel’la" mused the wizard aloud. "And why is it, that you forsake your studies so early in the evening" the wizard smiled, glancing at the initiate symbol of Innoruuk hidden under her tunic. Stopping her she was about to speak an answer he continued, "My name young one, is Vaziel" at mention of his name she visibly paled although she remained completely composed. Seeing he had achieved the desired effect, the wizard continued again. "I understand there are ghost stories told about me to the bad children of Neriak, Tell me young one, do I look like a ghost" the wizard chuckled "I am interested in you Shallondra Bel’la, you are an enigma to me, how one so young possesses such power". <BR>As he finished his sentence the wizard felt a famliar mind come into the scope of his thoughts. He raised his hand to the girl to request a moment. Although clouding his mind from him, the wizard knew his abbil at once. The wizard made to continue on, ignoring the desire to find his friend and greet him, he would find me soon enough. No sooner had he thought these thoughts than a figure cloaked in grey walked from the upper level of the inn down the stairs to the bottom, obviously feigning interest to some facet of the inn in a way the wizard had seen displayed many times before. As the shadowknight was sizing up the room, the wizard mentally requested his abbil come join he and this young priestess. The wizard smiled as the shadowknight's composure flickered for an instant as Vaziel's thought had invaded his mind briefly. <BR>Grimacing, the shadowknight turned from the large windows and made his way to the table. Bowing deeply to the young priestess he sat and turned his cold eyes on the wizard. "You're alive then, we thought the worst had happened to you, and you've picked up more tricks I see as well" the shadowknight stated with little emotion. He appeared uneasy with the presence of the girl. "Shallondra Bel’la, might I introduce you to the reaver of Innoruuk..Noamuchath" the wizard replied. "What did your lord feel about my presence in Neriak knight? I'm sure you spoke with him" the wizard grinned then continued. "Agitated, I'm sure.....Regardless, I'm not here for any bidding of the queen or my father, I'm here on my own accord." At this the shadowknight nodded. "Tonight will be an interesting night of reunions, and new beginnings I think." stated the wizard as he poured the shadowknight some tea.<P>------------------<BR>Lady Vox love toy,<BR>Who drive car?!?!<BR>Vaziel Oloth'Colbauth<BR>Imperia Discordia<BR>"Of course I'm an idiot..Did I ever claim otherwise?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#696158">

</FONT><HR>Leizav awoke in a cold sweat. "Come to me now" came the voice of his dreams again, this time obviously real because he was awake.His arm burned where a black rose was etched into it by the forces of magic. Damn that wizard Leizav thought to himself bitterly. Even if the wizard's father let go the debt he owed him, he would always be reminded of the son.<P>No time to mourn mistakes made thought the enchanter to himself. He bathed and dressed quickly in his finest black robe. He left his room at the inn in the foreign quarter of Neriak, tipping the young ogre at the door to ensure he kept the same room as the night before. Leizav had never known wealth, but recently his "benefactor", the wizard named Vaziel had fattened the enchanter's bank account. He now had more money than he could deal with, employing acountants to deal with it.<P>He made his way from the cobbled streets of the foriegn quarter to the black marble roads of Neriak commons. He could feel the wizard near now, at an inn...somewhere close. Instantly he knew. Leizav sighed, he would go mad for sure if the wizard continued to toy with his brain.<P>As he walked into the upper bar floor of the Blind Fish he greeted the barmaid with a request for red elven wine. He then grimaced and upped his request to two wines..one warmed. He retrieved the drinks, then made his way down the stairs to the table where the wizard sat.<P>As he rounded the corner he noticed there were people at the wizard's table, at first, thinking he had made a mistake he glanced around. Then realized the wizard sat there with two others. Off to the side of them Leizav noticed what appeared to be the town drunk..instead of lying there slobbering like normal he was peering intently with a cold gaze at the enchanter. Somewhat taken aback, Leizav made his way to the wizard's table.<P>As he approached he noticed the one marked by his armor as a shadowknight place his hand on his sword. A devilish sword at that, stained black by the blood of the thousands it must have dealt death to. He hovered a distance from the table awaiting his "master's" invite, wary of the shadowknight ready to deal him his death.<P>The wizard lifted his head and smiled evilly at the enchanter. "You're lucky I have time to spare above all other things enchanter...bring me my wine and sit with us." the wizard stated coldy. Hearing this the shadowknight let slip his grip on the sword, but held onto the enchanter with his strange gaze. <P>Leizav did as he was told and sat on his master's right side, sickeningly reminding him of his master and his master's father. "Leizav..I bid you welcome Shallondra" he bowed with a smile to the young girl. "And Noamuchath" he nodded to the shadowknight. "G-Greetings to you" he managed to squeak out.<P>Still smiling like a jackal the wizard said "We will wait here for the others" glancing at the enchanter he said "Tell them the task...the task given to you, enchanter" Leizav looked at the wizard shocked, Hadn't his the wizard's father given him implicit instructions not to tell of his journey's origin? "Yes fool, they, well the knight anyway, already know who I am, and who forced your quest on you, now tell" the wizard said, reading his mind again.<P>"I..I am encumbered with the task of retrieving the two drops of blood from two undead imps who dwell in the old Erudite city ruins under Paineel. I was given a map in my mind of the location of the imps once I reach the city" the enchanter continued "I was also told to gather others to help me and also to not reveal to anyone my true reason for going to this city." The shadowknight shifted in his seat, disturbed by what he had just heard. The cleric merely sat there, not knowing what to say. The wizard however....he was grinning more evil than any gargoyle the young enchanter had ever seen. This was going to be a long night...a long night indeed.<P>"Now, back to our conversation my dear, I believe I posed a question" the wizard stated, eyeing the shaken young priestess.<P>------------------<BR>Swift death comes not from the enemy...but the trusted friend...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#615850">

</FONT><HR>Shallondra sat in the inn, at the table of the wizard and his comrades in awe.  Never, in her short life, had she thought she'd been so captivated so quickly.  She'd been about to answer the master wizard, when the shadow knight had entered the room, sending another chill down her spine.  Then, as if the dark knight next to her was not enough, the young enchanter joined them, mentioning some task that he was to accomplish.  Somehow, she knew this was destiny around her…  Like the dream at night, she had, but this was right in front of her and all around.<P>She looked back at the wizard, who was sitting, rather patiently for an answer to the question he'd posed.  The initiate symbol of Innoruuk seemed to weigh on her, like a lie and a reminder of where she should be.  All of the devoted initiates were dutifully on their knees in the temple, yet here she was, her heart investigating the mystery sitting before her.  Coolly and calmly, more calmly than she truly was, she regarded the wizard.  She supposed hiding anything from him would not be in her best interest, nor was it necessary.<P>Looking down for a minute, Shallondra simply answered, "I find little solace in prayer these days, I'm afraid."  She looked away, hoping that would suffice.<P>Smiling, the wizard said, "And why is that?"<P>She flinched, somehow she knew he would ask further and would have been disappointed if he did not.  She glanced at the shadow knight, whose expression was unreadable, and then over to the enchanter, he was merely eyeing the wizard nervously.  She could understand why.  To have this dark one haunting every waking and sleeping moment would be most disconcerting.<P>Taking a deep breath she looked back at the wizard directly, saying bluntly, "I don’t belong there.  I was not meant to be there.  That is what instinct tells me.  I do not see the reason for futile prayer when it means nothing to me."  A bit of defiance showed through, the feelings she left buried deep inside often.  She was very resentful about being caged in a place she felt was wrong for her.<P>Leaning forward, glancing at the hooded eyes of the shadow knight again, Shallondra asked boldly, "I would ask, sir, what is your interest in me?"<BR><P>------------------<BR>Shallondra Bel'la<BR>Soul Caller, Myrkul's Prophet<BR>Undead Lords<P>"Know thy role."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#696158">

</FONT><HR>Rhemiel paused on the steps to take in the group of people at the Blind Fish. Waiting in darkness, he listened to their conversation for a few moments, the little runaway babbling at length about who she was, and why she was there. There was also Noamu`Chath, a respected Shadowknight whom Rhemiel had heard mentioned in many stories of Tier`Dal victories.<P>The two men clad in the flowing robes of the pure casters, however, Rhemiel only knew by sight... and in one case, reputation. The first was an enchanter, about his own age, named Leizav... or something like that. Rumor was that he was the bastard son of a whore and a fallen member of his own Priesthood. Rhemiel spit, marking out the Father's sigil on his breastplate with one bluish finger.<P>It was forbidden to speak of the enchanter's father, nor even to name him.<P>It was the other man who set a cold sweat onto Rhemiel's brow. Cloaked in mystery, the shadows seemed to follow him around the room. This one could only be Vaziel Oloth'Colbauth, rumored to be the son of The Lord Mayong Mistmoore. <P>Shaking off a sudden chill, and realizing he still wore his golden platemail (thus not being very surreptitious in his eavesdropping), he began to descend the stairs into the common room. Earlier in the day, Rhemiel has been sent by the High Priest of Innoruuk, Perrir Zexus, to babysit a group of recruits to the warrior's guild. The blood of the halflings they had slaughtered, and some of their own, still glazed his armor in places.<P>His mission before prayer and sleep tonight was to go find Shallondra at the tavern. Pulling his Disciple Symbol of Innoruuk from the neck of his mail, Rhemiel announced himself to the group, avoiding the gaze of the legendary wizard, that seemed to seep into his very soul.<P>"Shallondra, Lord Zexus is most displeased with your desertion of the Spires tonight. He requests your immediate presence in his chambers. Likely, you will be whipped bloody. I can't say you deserve less," he added with a cold smile. This one always challenged his authority. Perhaps he could frighten her into supplication and obeidence.<P>Rhemiel had worked hard to earn his position; apprenticed to Lord Zexus himself, Rhemiel enjoyed many responsibilites, few limitations, and a library of new knowledge nearly everyday. Having no sons of his own, Perrir Zexus had taken a liking to the young priest, praising his natural ability with the Father's Gifts, and grooming him as his replacement.<P>This was partially why he did not like Shallondra. She threatened his position as the favorite. TWICE today during his talk with Lord Zexus, the High Priest had mentioned her. She was learning at a phenomenal rate, and her own ability to use the Gifts rivaled even Rhemiel's. What bothered him even more about her, however, was that she was quite beautiful.<P>At first Rhemiel had tried to write it off to the fact that he was so young. But grown men followed his orders often enough to give the lie to that theory. No, she was able to have her way with him everytime because he could not stand against that beauty for long. It was a weakness, and one he intended to quell this time before she did it to him again.<P>"Come, Shallondra. We're going NOW. And when Lord Zexus is finished with you, I want you to write me a report, detailing..." Rhemiel was already walking away, hoping in his heart of hearts that she was following, eyes to the ground. <P>He turned slowly, and what he saw did not surprise him in the slightest. All of the courage he had screwed himself up for had faded, and she was standing where he had left her, glaring at him hatefully.<P>"I said now, Shallondra," he breathed, hoping he had masked the falter in his voice well enough. She was going to win again it seemed. Rhemiel's heart sank. The rest of his orders were to follow the girl wherever she went, giving her "the benefit of your experience, skill, and knowledge. If she decides to go with Vaziel, you are to train her on the journey. Pending your approval of her performance throughout, she'll be made Disciple when she returns." Lord Zexus had actually smiled.<P>If she did as Rhemiel had ordered, she obviously wouldn't be going on any journey, and he could return to the Spires. If she refused (and likely Rhemiel's order essentially NOT to go ensured that she would indeed accompany the wizard), he would have to follow her as ordered, making himself be "available to the girl." <P>Silently cursing Lord Zexus, and praying she would do as he commanded this time, Rhemiel waited.<P>------------------<BR>Rhemiel Xukuth'd'Oloth<BR>Lesser Priest of Innoruuk<P>"I preserve life, lightdweller.

</FONT><HR>The shadowknight said nothing, nodding in response to the words of greeting and the acknowledgement of his expected arrival.  He bowed politely to the lady and then sat, his back to the cold stone walls.  With as immensely neutral an expression as he could muster, he watched and listened allowing the babble of words to flow over his conscious thoughts.<P>He didn't appear to be paying the slightest attention to the conversation, but rather acting as a sort of guard to the privacy of the discussion.  His glance discouraged the serving maid from returning and his steady stare sent the intoxicated laborers off to find a new place to drown their sorrows.  Soon the entire lower floor of the tavern was deserted, save for the servant washing goblets in the farthest corner, carefully not glancing in their direction.<P>When the armored and bloodstained priest entered the tavern, Noamu'Chath shifted position slightly to better observe.  The young man's facial expression gave a great deal away as he glanced over the unusual assemblage before squaring his shoulders, mustering a suitably disdainful expression and then speaking coldly.  "Shallondra, Lord Zexus is most displeased with your desertion of the Spires tonight. He requests your immediate presence in his chambers. Likely, you will be whipped bloody. I can't say you deserve less."<P>The tone was both cool and gloating, causing the female at the table to flinch before she remembered herself.<P>As the priest rattled off orders, Noamu'Chath fought desperately to stave off a grin, finally managing to hide his amusement with a menacingly direct glare at the youth.  It seemed the cleric wasn't quite as sure of himself as he was letting on, his voice rattled with a note of uncertainty which was glaringly obvious to the knight's trained ear.  As the priest waited for a response from the woman, the instincts of the shadowknight took over.<P>Standing with the grace of the woodland lions, the knight stretched slowly, eyes still fixed with a predatory stare on the face of the now exceptionally nervous looking young man.  Smiling a slow, wickedly indulgent grin, Noamu'Chath spoke quietly with a voice pitched for only the youth's ear, "not a chance she'll buy it, the tone needs work".<P>Then he announced a bit louder, ignoring the orders entirely, "We'd best be on our way abbilen, we have much to do and others to meet outside the grace and comfort of Neriak's walls". Striding past the young priest, the knight made a point of pushing close enough that the young man must back up or risk a collision.<P><P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.cazic-thule.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000031.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=Adventurer|APO|s+Inn&TopicSubject=The+master|APO|s+plan.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#696158">

</FONT><HR>Rhemiel tried not to grimace when the Shadowknight spoke to him in a low voice.<P> "Not a chance she'll buy it, the tone needs work," and then more loudly, and to the group as a whole (including himself, to Rhemiel's ear), "We'd best be on our way, abbilen, we have much to do and others to meet outside the grace and comfort of Neriak's walls." Anger flared up in the young priest's eyes as the Shadowknight stalked past him, very nearly knocking him over.<P>"Begging pardon, Shadowknight, but my business is with the young deserter, and her alone. And I am not your..." The Shadowknight, nearly to the bottom of the stairs, was a good five paces away from Rhemiel, but he covered that distance like a viper. Rhemiel found it difficult to square himself up with the Knight so close to him.<P>"You have my pardon, young Cleric." The words were spoken in a tone the man might have used to tell Rhemiel how he planned to kill him. The Shadowknight stood like a coiled whip, and Rhemiel had to force his hand not to stray to the black mace hanging at his belt. <P>He had the distinct impression Noamu'Chath would kill him the instant a muscle in his hand twitched. Not that he planned to use it, but Rhemiel found comfort in the mace. It was etched all over with Tier'Dal characters of various age, some even in the old Drow tongue. Lord Zexus had given it to him, and it was a sign of the young priest's station at the Spires.<P>Rhemiel lowered his eyes, and placed his knuckles to his forehead in a sign of respect. He spoke quietly to the Knight, "Please, Master Noamu'Chath, forgive my outburst. It was... unseemly," he managed to add. The Shadowknight remained where he stood for a moment, then seemed to turn away without relaxing at all. It took Rhemiel a moment to realize he had stopped breathing, and air came into his lungs like fire, with the amount of control it took not to suck in a great lungful all at once.<P>"Shallondra, please. Don't make this hard on either of us," Rhemiel said. He felt reasonably assured that his voice held none of the terror he had felt only seconds ago. "Perhaps Lord Zexus will simply send you to your quarters for the night, to reflect on what you have done."<P>Half of Rhemiel knew he had lost this battle before it had begun, and that half of him had caused him to bring a pack with various stones, herbs and liquids containing magical power, food and water for a long journey, and his good black brocaded cloak. This was in a small grain cart left outside the entrance to the inn; a few plat paid to the bouncer ensured its safety. <P>At Shallondra's defiant expression, and hearing the words of his master in his ears, Rhemiel summoned up a semblance of grace and headed toward the stairs to retrieve the pack. It seemed he would be going as well.<P>------------------<BR>Rhemiel Xukuth'd'Oloth<BR>Lesser Priest of Innoruuk<P>"I preserve life, lightdweller.

</FONT><HR>"Shallondra, please. Don't make this hard on either of us," Rhemiel stated. "Perhaps Lord Zexus will simply send you to your quarters for the night, to reflect on what you have done." He pleaded again. The young cleric, realizing he had lost, turned to make his way out of the inn. Shallondra glared at him still. <P>Acknowledging that his charade had ended, and most everyone present knew who he was. The wizard let the enchantment of his robes fall, they shifted from the red training robes to his normal robe of chilled spider silk.The room grew stifling hot as the wizard stood. "Gather your things from outside cleric, you will join us, even if just to spy on our workings for your master" came the chilling voice of the wizard. The cleric stopped, clearly disturbed that the wizard knew he had brought such things. "Have no fear young one, In fact, know this." the wizard continued. "Your master sent you here to meet your death tonight. He already knew the young priestess would not come with you." The wizard smiled. "I know this to be true, I've known Zexus since he was a small child" The cleric shot a defiant glance back at him, clearly not believing the wizard. He only slightly wondered how the wizard who appeared so young, could have seen or known the elderly Zexus as a child. The wizard chuckled. "Fine then, believe I lie if you must, no matter, you will accompany us regardless". The wizard turned his gaze to Noamu'Chath.
