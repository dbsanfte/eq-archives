      <h1><b><u>Myth &amp; Karren to leave guild???</u></b></h1>
      <p>After a few days of dealing with this, I still don't know what is bringing 
        this on. I had thought that I was doing a good job, we where having raids, 
        the membership was going up. Karren and I where helping as many guild 
        mates as we could, But I guess because we could not be on 24/7 we both 
        failed.</p>
      <p>Let me set a few thing straight.</p>
      <p>1) Karren is in the USAF, and we live on a Air Force base. This past 
        week Karren was out of state, doing AirForce stuff. That is why Myth was 
        not at the last raid, I was playing Karren so we would have a TP'er to 
        get people to and from the raid.</p>
      <p>2) For the past 3 weeks, I have been telling people and posting that 
        we are moving (Get the keys this Monday morning) and I have spent this 
        last week packing up my house, while Karren was gone. Of course people 
        choose not to read that and started to e-mail me saying I was not online 
        enough to be the guild leader.</p>
      <p>3) I have posted over and over that I play 7 char all of whom are in 
        the guild, So if Mythgalin isn't on then I am on as one of my alts, and 
        that are. Jodeko, Jodekoy, Gwadzilia, Kaldec, Mythgalien, &amp; Kinshaya.</p>
      <p>4) The fact that I have had to put some stuff on hold, like the ogre 
        race. The Ogre race is on hold for a few reasons. 1st) I had to test the 
        course, I did. 2nd) I had talked to a friend about it and he thought his 
        guild might like to join in. I thought that would be a good idea, give 
        us a chance to make friends in a new guild. 3rd) I am posting it to the 
        LUCLIN.COM website, but have to get a clear date</p>
      <p>I must say that after some of the e-mails I have gotten, I really felt 
        like disbanding the guild, but don't worry I won't. I'm not sure what 
        Karren and I will do, we have a lot of time to talk about it. I have planned 
        a guild Meeting for July 14 at 5pm pst. I will talk to the guild then 
        and see how everyone feels. I will also go online on last time tonight, 
        before I pack this computer up, and talk more about this.</p>
      <p>As for when I'll be back online, I should be back online before this 
        new week is out.</p>
