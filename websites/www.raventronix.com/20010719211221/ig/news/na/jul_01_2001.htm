      <h1 align="center"><b><u>Myth &amp; Karren back???</u></b></h1>
      <p>That's right all. We are back. The move is done, my ISDN line is back 
        up and I can get back on the web.....WOOT BABY.... </p>
      <p>I have allot to talk about, so let me get started.</p>
      <p><b>1st) </b>This web site. I admit that I have not been updating this 
        site as often as needed, so I decided to go on a schedule. I'll be posting 
        new news every Sunday. The members section will be updated every Saturday. 
        If I can stick to that all should be good :)</p>
      <p><b>2nd)</b> The Newsletter. Some of you may have noticed that the newsletter 
        has not been e-mailed out for awhile. The reason for that is a few jokers 
        posted fake e-mail's and I got a few e-mail's back to me calling me a 
        spamer. Now that's not to bad, but the also got a hold of my ISP and I 
        got a nasty e-mail from them. So I deleted my newsletter mailing list 
        and decided to rebuild it from scratch. If you want to get the Newsletter 
        via e-mail then just go to the Mailing list link to the right and fill 
        out the form. I'll then send a conformation e-mail to every one who signs 
        up to make sure they want to get the newsletter.</p>
      <p><b>3rd)</b> The Charter has been updated, please take a minute and look 
        it over. </p>
      <p><b>4th)</b> The GuildMOTD. Just to let everyone know, only Karren and 
        I will be posting the GuildMOTD, NO ONE ELSE. If you have something you 
        want to be posted in it, send me a tell or drop me a e-mail and I'll post 
        it in. I'm doing this to make sure that no important info get over writing.</p>
      <p><b>5th)</b> I've added a Archive of all the past news, the link is at 
        the bottom of the page.</p>
      <p><b>6th)</b> The Members section is back up <i>( I know...&quot;About 
        time Myth&quot;) </i>Look it over and if you are not listed the fill out 
        the census, if you see a mistake then just drop me a e-mail and I'll fix 
        it for you. </p>
      <p>7th) Last but most important.....Guild Meetings. We are going to have 
        monthly guild meetings. The Officers only meeting will be held the first 
        Friday of every month. It will be held at the tunnel entrance in Nro. 
        ALL OFFICERS MUST COME. This meeting will NOT be held in guild chat, so 
        you must be there. The regular Meeting for all members will be held the 
        first Saturday of every month, and this meeting will be held in guild 
        chat, so all you need to do is find a safe place to stand / sit for the 
        meeting. Both meeting will start at 5pm PST</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>That's about it, Take care and hunt safe.</p>
