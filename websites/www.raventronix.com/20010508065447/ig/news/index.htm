        <p>Hello all</p>
        <p>The Guild Library is up, so if you need items for spell research stop 
          in and see if we have it. Everyone else should stop by and look over 
          what we need. That way if you loot any of the items you'll know if the 
          guild needs them or not. </p>
        <p>Thanks</p>

        <p>Hello all</p>
        <p>As many of you have heard, Mythgalin has now become the new Guild Leader. 
          Karren will be takeing over as Vice Guild Leader. Just to let you all 
          know that I (Myth) play 7 Chars all of who aare in the guild. I play 
          Mythgalin, Kaldec, Jodeko, Jodekoy, Rizndedead, Gwadzilia, Kensiya. 
          So if you don't see Myth on look for my other Chars. </p>
        <p>I have updated the charter, added a new section for our upcoming Guild 
          Event, updated the raid info. Please look them over. </p>
        <p>I need comeing up with a &quot;guild shout&quot; for when we enter 
          a zone and there are other IG members in the zone. FYI &quot;Hail Gazers&quot; 
          has already been shot down.</p>
        <p>E-mail me your ideas.</p>
        <p>Take care all.</p>

        <p>Hello all, just got back from the guild meeting. If you missed it you 
          can read the log file of it <a href="meetinglog.htm" target="_blank">HERE 
          </a></p>
        <p>We talked about 6 main things, and I'll go over them now.</p>
        <p>1) For while we have been with out a Guild Leader. No Popice has not 
          left the guild, but he has not been on in over a month. Without a Guild 
          Leader we can not make officers, and as of now we are very short on 
          the number of active officers in the guild. I asked all those preasnt 
          at the meeting if they had a problem with me asking Popice to transfer 
          Control of the Guild to me, everyone thought it was a good idea, So 
          I will be Contacting Popice.</p>
        <p>2) We are going to be haveing a guild event in the next few weeks, 
          It will be a ogre race. Look in the forum under Raid Event info, for 
          more information.</p>
        <p>3) We are also haveing a raid on Befallen in WC. Please stop by the 
          raid froum and post what days and times are good for you . </p>
        <p>4) We have a large forum here, so please lets start to use it more 
          :)</p>
        <p>5) We also talked about a membership drive, but we are going to have 
          to wait untill the transfer of control, so we can make more officers.</p>
        <p>6) The next Guild Meeting will be May 12 at 5pm PST</p>
        <p>At the end of the meeting the question was asked if I was takeing over 
          as Guild Leader who would be Vice-Guild Leader. Karren was voted as 
          the new VGL by those at the meeting. She will take over that post once 
          I take over as Guild Leader.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thanks all.</p>

        <p>Wow, has it been that long since I did a update to the news?? So what's 
          new you all ask, what is the status of the guild? Will let me be blunt. 
          The guild is in trouble, I hardly see more then 5 or 6 people on anymore, 
          we are loosing people left and right. Now as the VGL I'll take some 
          of the heat for that, so here is what we are going to do to try and 
          turn this all around.</p>
        <p>1) We are going to start to hold guild meeting once a month. They will 
          be held on the 2nd Saturday of every month, at 7pm PST. Now you don't 
          have to travel anywhere, just find a safe spot and we can do it all 
          in guild chat. Popice or I will be in charge of the meetings.</p>
        <p>2) We are adding a Guild Library. Here is how this will work. If you 
          loot or have any words, pages, or runes, that you can't use and don't 
          want to sell, send a tell to Myth or Karren, and we will come pick them 
          up from you. Karren has room on her account to make a librarians, they 
          will hold the items in the bank in Freeport. I'll keep a list on the 
          web page of all the items in the library, you will be able to print 
          this out. Now you are probably asking &quot;how do we use this?&quot;. 
          Very simple, it will be a first come first serve type of thing. Every 
          guild member can us the library. So let's make this a big one, OK.</p>
        <p>3) Epic Quests &amp; Class Quests. Over the next few days I'll be adding 
          forum channels for each classes Epic Quests. If you are starting your 
          Epic and need help or items this is the place to post. I know that we 
          don;t have to many who are high enough to go after their Epic's, but 
          if we start this now it will be in place when people start to need it. 
          As for the other Quests, we need to start to pull together and help 
          each other out with quests, I.E. J-boots, or whatever it may be. I know 
          that almost everyone in the guild would like a pair of J-boots, so that 
          brings me to the next point.</p>
        <p>4) J-boot quest. I would like to get 2 or 3 high (lvl 35 plus) guild 
          mates and spend a day hunting the AC in Sro for guild mates. We Kill 
          the AC and let guildmate X loot the ring. If you want to help with this 
          let me know and we can set up a day / time.</p>
        <p>5) Raids &amp; Events. OK I for one am all for holding raids and events 
          and being one of the prime people to set this stuff up I have a few 
          problems. Everyone yells &quot;WE NEED A RAID / EVENT&quot;, OK so we 
          get ideas and times etc., and hold a raid / event, and guess what? No 
          one shows, or only 4 or 5 show. This is no way to do this. So I decide 
          to start holding guild raids by level. It looks like a good deal of 
          our members are in the high teens to mid 20's. We don't have enough 
          high lvl guild mates to do anything like a dragon raid or such thing. 
          But once we do I'll start adding raids for the High lvl people also. 
          For now the guild raids will be for level 15 to lvl 30. Now if you are 
          a high lvl player and want to show up to handle crowd control or heals 
          / buffs, then great. As for events, they will be open to all members, 
          we may hold our own Best of the Best, per class and lvl, and give prizes 
          out to the winners. That's just one idea. Post your ideas to the forum.</p>
        <p>That's about covers everything</p>
        <p>Take Care and Hunt Safe.</p>

            that I am back to 100%. For those who didn't now a month or so ago 
            I was in a accident and broke both my arms. I had to put a lot of 
            things on hold, including this web site. Anyway I'm back and here 
            is what's been happening. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">First we lost a member of your 
            guild, Caldek left us to form his own guild, <a href="http://rimmic.homepage.com/" target="_blank">The 
            Elders Of Faye</a>. Caldek has done a great job with the new guild. 
            BTW his guild is a sister guild to ours. Kind of nice to have friends.

          <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">Next up was our Guild leader change, 
            Caldory left us, and Popice has taken over, ALL HAIL POPICE. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">Ok now onto the news about the 
            web site. We need all of your help. During my down time, all the guild 
            info was lost IE who the officers are, who's in the guild etc. So 
            we need everyone to go to the members section and fill out the Guild 
            census. Also please sign up for the guild newsletter, and of course 
            I did pictures of your characters. All the links to send this info 
            is on the appropriate web pages. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">The web page will be getting some 
            new features in the next couple of days. I'm working hard on getting 
            a forum set up for us, I am also running around and taken screen shots. 
            So that's what's new. Help us get this address out to everyone and 
            spread the word that the site is back up. </font></p>
