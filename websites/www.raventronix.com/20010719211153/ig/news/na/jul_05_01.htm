      <p>Hello all.</p>
      <p>This is going to be sent out as the Newsletter, posted on the web site 
        under News, &amp; and posted again in the Forums. After all that every 
        member of the guild should see it.</p>
      <p>So why all this you may ask, because I have news for you all.</p>
      <p>First off News on the web site. I have just updated the Guild Library, 
        and the Members Section. Note on the Members Section, I have not added 
        links to your census info. I will be doing that once I make sure that 
        everyone listed there is in the right spot, and is still in the guild. 
        Also if you are not listed fill out the census so you can be.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the upcoming guild meetings. This Friday, July 06, 2001 is 
        the Officer Meeting. All officers must attend in person. It will be held 
        at the tunnel entrance in Nro. If you don’t know where it is stop by EQATLAS 
        and look at a map. The meeting will start at 5pm PST. We will then be 
        having a Guild meeting on Saturday July 07, 2001. This meeting is for 
        all members, and will be held in guild chat. So to attend all you have 
        to do is find a safe place to stand/sit for the meeting. Below is a list 
        of some of the thing that we will be going over at the Meeting.</p>

      <p>Ok this is my section to yell. I am getting tried of getting e-mails 
        from people telling me how many of you are going to be leaving the guild. 
        Jarvin bitched about what was wrong with the guild (in his opinion), and 
        addressed them as fast as I could. I was in the middle of moving to a 
        new house at the time. After I had addressed the issues, Jarvin left the 
        guild. Now I want to post a message I got from Jarvin. My comments will 
        be in Brackets.</p>
      <p>E-mail from Jarvin, 07/04/01:</p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">&quot;Glad to see you are back, I hope that everything 
        went well during the move. I know what it's like.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">I have to apologize for some of the crap I started, 
        it wasn't my intention to have people sending you E-Mails telling you 
        to leave. Personally I think you do a good job, just needed to make some 
        guild changes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF00FF"><b><i>(Myth: I did make changes, but not fast enough 
        to please some people)</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">I have left IG and so has Wearya, although he left 
        about a week after me. I can't speak for him, but I am trying to get into 
        Glorious Rising. He might be to, we both were at their last Mistmoore 
        raid.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF00FF"><b><i>(Myth: I have no problem with anyone who 
        wants to leave the guild, and if you want to join a guild more to your 
        level or taste, No problem)</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">As for other people in IG, there might be more 
        leaving at some point, but I assure you I am not trying to get anyone 
        to leave. I have no part in anyone who leaves. Wearya left on his own.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF00FF"><i><b>(Myth: This part get me, read on and see 
        what I mean)</b></i></font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">If I don't get into GR then I might be starting 
        my own guild. Now if this happens, some people from IG, who will remain 
        un-named, have already said they will join it. This might not happen though, 
        even if I don't get into GR.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF00FF"><b><i>(Myth: Ok, let me see if I get this. Stated 
        above it states that you are not trying to get people to leave, then it 
        goes on to say &quot;I might be starting my own guild. Now if this happens, 
        some people from IG, who will remain un-named, have already said they 
        will join it.&quot; OK to me this sounds like recruiting. If there are 
        people in the guild right now who are only here until the new guild starts, 
        then I wish they would just leave now. I have been putting a lot of work 
        in to this guild and if I don’t have the support of the members then what 
        is the point?)</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">I hope that IG stays together, it would be a shame 
        to see it fall apart. There is alot of good people, you and Karren included.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">Jarvin Jarvis</font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">38th Halfling Druid</font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">"I happen to be very tall...for a Halfling."</font></p>
      <p><font color="#33FFFF">PS: You ever want to hunt with me, feel free to 
        give me a tell. Been spending alot of time in Sol B lately, but i always 
        like change.&quot;</font></p>
      <p>This is the sort of thing that pisses me off to no end. Members send 
        me e-mails asking for changes in the guild, I look them over then I do 
        them, only to have them leave. Members asked for more meetings, so I set 
        a fixed time to have them, then I was asked by members if we could have 
        the meeting on another day. So I post a message in the GuildMOTD asking 
        members to e-mail me and tell me what day would be good for the meeting, 
        guess what after a week I got ZERO e-mails. That’s right no one e-mailed 
        me. So now I set the meeting dates, but I’m sure that there is going to 
        be someone who will bitch about the Time / Day. You know what I say to 
        that now….Tough. You had your chance to let me know, no one did. </p>
      <p>This is the bottom line folks, Jeanluc but it very will (BTW Thanks Jeanluc) 
        It is not only up to me and Karren to make this guild work, it is up to 
        every member, no matter what level. It is up to you all to use the forums, 
        to talk in guild chat, to show up for the raids, to make meetings. I can’t 
        and won’t try anymore to do it all. Depending on how this meeting goes 
        on Saturday, I may throw my hands up and walk away from the whole thing.</p>
      <p>The Ball is now in your courts, it’s up to every member of IG to make 
        this guild work, or to see it die out. Think about it, the meeting is 
        Saturday.</p>
