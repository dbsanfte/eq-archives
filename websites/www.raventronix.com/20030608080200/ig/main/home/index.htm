      <p>Hi all</p>
      <p>First let me welcome Rydiea back to IG...</p>
      <p>We are starting to do a good job at getting members back into IG. GREAT 
        :) Lets keep it up and in no time Vox is ours....</p>
      <p>I have updated the guild member section. I have started use Guild Magic, 
        so click on the <font color="#FF0033"><i><b>current members</b></i></font> 
        link to the left and head on over and sign up. You may see IG listed 2 
        times, please make sure the one you sign up for is the one that lists 
        Mythgalin as guild leader...</p>
      <p>Take care</p>

        <p>Hello all, the Mad Mythgalin is back to EQ. Yes I know it has been 
          awhile, and I have not been on as much as I should have been. I had 
          to deal with some very personal issues which I will not discuss here 
          and being in the hospital for a little while.</p>
        <p>But now I'm back almost at 100%....(almost) and dying to get back in 
          the swing of things.</p>
        <p>First off let me bring you all up to speed on the site, as you may 
          have seen the message boards have been reset and so has the web page. 
          I did this for 2 reasons, 1st that almost all of the posts on the message 
          boards where almost a year old, and 2nd because I wanted to start fresh.</p>
        <p>Second, The state of the guild. As many of you know we are very few 
          now. We need to work on this and start to bring in new faces and new 
          friends, a few old friends have come back to IG, Caldek Strombringer 
          is back (LVL 53 Cleric....can you say 90% rez....I knew you could).</p>
        <p>I'll need to hear from all the officers and current members, so please 
          drop me a line at <a href="mailto:%20mythgalin@raventronix.com">mythgalin@raventronix.com</a> 
          and tell me if you are a officer or a member.</p>
        <p>Also I have cleared the mailing lists, so everyone will need to resubscrib 
          to it. Just click on the &quot;Newsletter&quot; Link to the right and 
          follow the instructions</p>
        <p>Thanks all and stay safe</p>
