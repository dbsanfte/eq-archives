        have final say on all guild matters.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font color="#33CC33">3) Becoming an officer is a reward. Only Guild 
        members who are 25 lvl may become new Officers. (NOTE. I’m aware that 
        some of our current officers do not meet this level requirement. They 
        will still be officers. The new level Requirement only affects new Officers.)</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font color="#33CC33">4) All members must make a HOTKEY for trains. 
        Here is an example. </font></b></p>

      <p><font color="#33CC33"><b>5) All members are to follow the &quot;Play 
        Nice Policy&quot; set forth by Verent. We will not allow KS’ing, Stealing, 
        Begging, or any type of personal attacks.</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#33CC33"><b>6) All members must help out other Guild Mates 
        in need. I.E. If you are close to someone that needs help, then help them. 
        This doesn’t mean that you most leave a group, or give up a camp. If you 
        are free and can help then help. Now there are a few no-brainers to this 
        one. If you are in Halas, and you want a SoW or other buffs, and the only 
        guild person who can cast them is in say Freeport, don’t ask them to come 
        up there and buff you.</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#33CC33"><b>7) This Charter is not carved in stone and can 
        / will be updated as needed.</b></font></p>
