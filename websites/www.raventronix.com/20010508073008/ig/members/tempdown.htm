  <h1>The Members Page is down.</h1>
  
  <p>I have takenn the members page down untill we all fill out the new <a href="../census/index.htm" target="_blank">Census 
    Forum</a>. I am trying to get this all cleand up and add info to profiles 
    that people wanted listed. The easiest way is to just start this part of the 
    web site over again. So go fill out the <a href="../census/index.htm" target="_blank">Census</a>.</p>
  <p>Thanks</p>
