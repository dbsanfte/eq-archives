      <p>Welcome friend, sit down and warm yourself by the fire. Who am I you 
        ask? I go by many names throughout the lands, but you may call me the 
        Lore Keeper. It is my duty to watch and record all that happens to this 
        guild. What guild? I'm sorry I haven't told you about the guild, forgive 
        me. Let me fill your mug, and I will tell you the tale of Infinity's Gaze. 
      </p>
      <p>In the realm of Luclin on the world of Norrath, beings from every race 
        felt a pulling at their souls, something drawing them together. Races, 
        who before would think nothing of drawing steel at the sight of one another, 
        felt now a kinship towards one another. I cannot say why or how this happened, 
        but it did. One that day it was decide that they would bind together, 
        to search out others who felt the pull, and to help other, however they 
        could. I can see that this story has stirred something inside of you, 
        good.</p>
      <p>For now you may rest here, and read any of my tomes. They will go into 
        more depth about us and tell the stories of our members, and of our adventures. 
      </p>
      <p>Until later Rest well. </p>
