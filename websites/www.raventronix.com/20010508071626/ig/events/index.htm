          event.</b></p>
        <p>This race is only open for members of infinity's Gaze. Everyone who 
          would like to race will make a Level 1 Ogre. </p>
        <p>1) The Race will be ran in 7 sections. There is a start and finish 
          point in each of the 7 zones, once everyone reaches the Finish line 
          in a zone then we will all zone to the next stage. Once everyone is 
          in the new zone the next leg of the race will start.</p>
        <p>2) The top 3 finishers of each leg will be awarded points, 1st gets 
          20, 2nd gets 15, and 3rd gets 10. At the end of the whole race, the 
          ponits will be totaled and the top 3 winners will be annouced.</p>
        <p>3) &quot;What if I die?&quot; Will if you die, you have 2 choices. 
          1: you can drop out of the race. 2: You can try and catch up and hope 
          that the others are dying to :)</p>
        <p>4) Now as for buffs. To make this Fair, Karren will be at the Start 
          of each race. She will cast SoW on everyone, and will recast it at the 
          start of each leg. This should help you out run anything that tries 
          to attack you.</p>
        <p>The Prizes :) 1st place will get 200plat, 2nd place will get 150plat, 
          and 3rd will get 100plat.</p>
        <p>Below you will find maps of each leg of the race. Everyone should print 
          out the maps, and I would take a high level Char, and run the race to 
          get a feel for it.</p>
