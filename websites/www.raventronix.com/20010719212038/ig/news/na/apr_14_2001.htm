      <p>Hello all, just got back from the guild meeting. If you missed it you 
        can read the log file of it <a href="meetinglog.htm" target="_blank">HERE 
        </a></p>
      <p>We talked about 6 main things, and I'll go over them now.</p>
      <p>1) For while we have been with out a Guild Leader. No Popice has not 
        left the guild, but he has not been on in over a month. Without a Guild 
        Leader we can not make officers, and as of now we are very short on the 
        number of active officers in the guild. I asked all those preasnt at the 
        meeting if they had a problem with me asking Popice to transfer Control 
        of the Guild to me, everyone thought it was a good idea, So I will be 
        Contacting Popice.</p>
      <p>2) We are going to be haveing a guild event in the next few weeks, It 
        will be a ogre race. Look in the forum under Raid Event info, for more 
        information.</p>
      <p>3) We are also haveing a raid on Befallen in WC. Please stop by the raid 
        froum and post what days and times are good for you . </p>
      <p>4) We have a large forum here, so please lets start to use it more :)</p>
      <p>5) We also talked about a membership drive, but we are going to have 
        to wait untill the transfer of control, so we can make more officers.</p>
      <p>6) The next Guild Meeting will be May 12 at 5pm PST</p>
      <p>At the end of the meeting the question was asked if I was takeing over 
        as Guild Leader who would be Vice-Guild Leader. Karren was voted as the 
        new VGL by those at the meeting. She will take over that post once I take 
        over as Guild Leader.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Thanks all.</p>
