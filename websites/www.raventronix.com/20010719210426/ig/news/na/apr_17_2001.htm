      <p>Hello all</p>
      <p>As many of you have heard, Mythgalin has now become the new Guild Leader. 
        Karren will be takeing over as Vice Guild Leader. Just to let you all 
        know that I (Myth) play 7 Chars all of who aare in the guild. I play Mythgalin, 
        Kaldec, Jodeko, Jodekoy, Rizndedead, Gwadzilia, Kensiya. So if you don't 
        see Myth on look for my other Chars. </p>
      <p>I have updated the charter, added a new section for our upcoming Guild 
        Event, updated the raid info. Please look them over. </p>
      <p>I need comeing up with a &quot;guild shout&quot; for when we enter a 
        zone and there are other IG members in the zone. FYI &quot;Hail Gazers&quot; 
        has already been shot down.</p>
      <p>E-mail me your ideas.</p>
      <p>Take care all.</p>
      <p>Mythgalin Komo`Val</p>
