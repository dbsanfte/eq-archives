<P>Hail Gazers</P>

<P>Wow another newsletter this month?? That’s right, we have a lot of new info and news that needs to be brought to everyone’s attention.</P>

<P>First off, I have updated the Forums, give them a fresh start, so go a check them out. Speaking of Forums, you’ll see a new page that comes up before you get to the Forum. Fill this out and hit submit. The good thing about having me set up an account for you is that you can till the Forum to send new message to your e-mail, and a few other features.</P>

<P>Also the member’s page is down, yes this is right. I had a lot of people asking me to add thing to the census, and to change things etc. So I decided that I would do this be just starting over. So even if you just sent in the census, you will need to stop by and fill out the new one.</P>

<P>I’ll post the info that I posted on the guild page under news, that way it saves my some typing.</P>

<I><P>Wow, has it been that long since I did a update to the news?? So what's new you all ask, what is the status of the guild? Will let me be blunt. The guild is in trouble, I hardly see more then 5 or 6 people on anymore, we are loosing people left and right. Now as the VGL I'll take some of the heat for that, so here is what we are going to do to try and turn this all around.</P>

<P>1) We are going to start to hold guild meeting once a month. They will be held on the 2nd Saturday of every month, at 7pm PST. Now you don't have to travel anywhere, just find a safe spot and we can do it all in guild chat. Popice or I will be in charge of the meetings.</P>

<P>2) We are adding a Guild Library. Here is how this will work. If you loot or have any words, pages, or runes, that you can't use and don't want to sell, send a tell to Myth or Karren, and we will come pick them up from you. Karren has room on her account to make a librarians, they will hold the items in the bank in Freeport. I'll keep a list on the web page of all the items in the library, you will be able to print this out. Now you are probably asking "how do we use this?". Very simple, it will be a first come first serve type of thing. Every guild member can us the library. So let's make this a big one, OK.</P>

<P>3) Epic Quests &amp; Class Quests. Over the next few days I'll be adding forum channels for each classes Epic Quests. If you are starting your Epic and need help or items this is the place to post. I know that we don;t have to many who are high enough to go after their Epic's, but if we start this now it will be in place when people start to need it. As for the other Quests, we need to start to pull together and help each other out with quests, I.E. J-boots, or whatever it may be. I know that almost everyone in the guild would like a pair of J-boots, so that brings me to the next point.</P>

<P>4) J-boot quest. I would like to get 2 or 3 high (lvl 35 plus) guild mates and spend a day hunting the AC in Sro for guild mates. We Kill the AC and let guildmate X loot the ring. If you want to help with this let me know and we can set up a day / time.</P>

<P>5) Raids &amp; Events. OK I for one am all for holding raids and events and being one of the prime people to set this stuff up I have a few problems. Everyone yells "WE NEED A RAID / EVENT", OK so we get ideas and times etc., and hold a raid / event, and guess what? No one shows, or only 4 or 5 show. This is no way to do this. So I decide to start holding guild raids by level. It looks like a good deal of our members are in the high teens to mid 20's. We don't have enough high lvl guild mates to do anything like a dragon raid or such thing. But once we do I'll start adding raids for the High lvl people also. For now the guild raids will be for level 15 to lvl 30. Now if you are a high lvl player and want to show up to handle crowd control or heals / buffs, then great. As for events, they will be open to all members, we may hold our own Best of the Best, per class and lvl, and give prizes out to the winners. That's just one idea. Post your ideas to the forum.</P>

<P>That's about covers everything</P>
