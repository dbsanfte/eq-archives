      <p>Wow, has it been that long since I did a update to the news?? So what's 
        new you all ask, what is the status of the guild? Will let me be blunt. 
        The guild is in trouble, I hardly see more then 5 or 6 people on anymore, 
        we are loosing people left and right. Now as the VGL I'll take some of 
        the heat for that, so here is what we are going to do to try and turn 
        this all around.</p>
      <p>1) We are going to start to hold guild meeting once a month. They will 
        be held on the 2nd Saturday of every month, at 7pm PST. Now you don't 
        have to travel anywhere, just find a safe spot and we can do it all in 
        guild chat. Popice or I will be in charge of the meetings.</p>
      <p>2) We are adding a Guild Library. Here is how this will work. If you 
        loot or have any words, pages, or runes, that you can't use and don't 
        want to sell, send a tell to Myth or Karren, and we will come pick them 
        up from you. Karren has room on her account to make a librarians, they 
        will hold the items in the bank in Freeport. I'll keep a list on the web 
        page of all the items in the library, you will be able to print this out. 
        Now you are probably asking &quot;how do we use this?&quot;. Very simple, 
        it will be a first come first serve type of thing. Every guild member 
        can us the library. So let's make this a big one, OK.</p>
      <p>3) Epic Quests &amp; Class Quests. Over the next few days I'll be adding 
        forum channels for each classes Epic Quests. If you are starting your 
        Epic and need help or items this is the place to post. I know that we 
        don;t have to many who are high enough to go after their Epic's, but if 
        we start this now it will be in place when people start to need it. As 
        for the other Quests, we need to start to pull together and help each 
        other out with quests, I.E. J-boots, or whatever it may be. I know that 
        almost everyone in the guild would like a pair of J-boots, so that brings 
        me to the next point.</p>
      <p>4) J-boot quest. I would like to get 2 or 3 high (lvl 35 plus) guild 
        mates and spend a day hunting the AC in Sro for guild mates. We Kill the 
        AC and let guildmate X loot the ring. If you want to help with this let 
        me know and we can set up a day / time.</p>
      <p>5) Raids &amp; Events. OK I for one am all for holding raids and events 
        and being one of the prime people to set this stuff up I have a few problems. 
        Everyone yells &quot;WE NEED A RAID / EVENT&quot;, OK so we get ideas 
        and times etc., and hold a raid / event, and guess what? No one shows, 
        or only 4 or 5 show. This is no way to do this. So I decide to start holding 
        guild raids by level. It looks like a good deal of our members are in 
        the high teens to mid 20's. We don't have enough high lvl guild mates 
        to do anything like a dragon raid or such thing. But once we do I'll start 
        adding raids for the High lvl people also. For now the guild raids will 
        be for level 15 to lvl 30. Now if you are a high lvl player and want to 
        show up to handle crowd control or heals / buffs, then great. As for events, 
        they will be open to all members, we may hold our own Best of the Best, 
        per class and lvl, and give prizes out to the winners. That's just one 
        idea. Post your ideas to the forum.</p>
      <p>That's about covers everything</p>
      <p>Take Care and Hunt Safe.</p>
