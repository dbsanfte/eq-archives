      <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">First let me let everyone know that 
        I am back to 100%. For those who didn't now a month or so ago I was in 
        a accident and broke both my arms. I had to put a lot of things on hold, 
        including this web site. Anyway I'm back and here is what's been happening. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">First we lost a member of your guild, 
        Caldek left us to form his own guild, <a href="http://rimmic.homepage.com/" target="_blank">The 
        Elders Of Faye</a>. Caldek has done a great job with the new guild. BTW 
        his guild is a sister guild to ours. Kind of nice to have friends. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">Next up was our Guild leader change, 
        Caldory left us, and Popice has taken over, ALL HAIL POPICE. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">Ok now onto the news about the web 
        site. We need all of your help. During my down time, all the guild info 
        was lost IE who the officers are, who's in the guild etc. So we need everyone 
        to go to the members section and fill out the Guild census. Also please 
        sign up for the guild newsletter, and of course I did pictures of your 
        characters. All the links to send this info is on the appropriate web 
        pages. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">The web page will be getting some 
        new features in the next couple of days. I'm working hard on getting a 
        forum set up for us, I am also running around and taken screen shots. 
        So that's what's new. Help us get this address out to everyone and spread 
        the word that the site is back up. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#66FF33">Thanks </font></p>
