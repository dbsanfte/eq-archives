      </b></font><font face="Arial" size="3">by Putty<br>
      23 November 1999</font>
      <p><font face="Arial">The air was heavy with tension in Nanto. The
      streaking prodigies of Vitae Rising had gathered at the behest of Hearding
      to test their skills. Two groups had formed, each filled with doddering
      fools. Oh rue the day that Putty's only son, Hermes, was left without
      companions. &quot;Vengeance will be mine&quot;, muttered Hermes as he
      rubbed his hands in long slow circles.&nbsp; &quot;These miscreants know
      not their err&quot;. And with that, he slid his way through the crowd.</p>
      <p>&quot;Peanuts, popcorn....HOT DOGS HERE!&quot;, cried Hrothgar out of
      the throng.</p>
      <p>&quot;No wait, that’s just my stomach talking&quot;, I thought to
      myself.&nbsp; &quot;You need a teammate Hroth?&quot; I asked him, dry
      hands once again tracing circles across each other.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes&quot;, came the strong reply, &quot;This is my first outing
      with Vitae Rising&quot;.</p>
      <p>&quot;Excellent&quot;, I croaked, &quot;you may join me in my evil
      plans to destroy the world!!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot; said Hroth, puzzled.</p>
      <p>&quot;Uhhh, I mean...Please, join MY team&quot;.</p>
      <p>Suddenly another figure elbowed its way through the throng.&nbsp;
      &quot;Hermes, did I hear you need companions?&quot; It was Draynor, a wily
      lifemage.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yesssssss, must find the precioussssssss&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Huh&quot;?</p>
      <p>&quot;Gack! Look at the wretched role-playing worm I've become&quot;, I
      muttered to myself.&nbsp; &quot;We will call ourselves the VR Winners.&nbsp;
      I’m gonna fellow you in boys.&quot;&nbsp; So right then, history was
      made, lives were changed, the future looked bright. VR Winners had been
      formed.</p>
      <p>So, as Hearding babbled in the background, we formulated our plan. We
      were gonna run like the wind to Yanshi, then find our trinkets there.
      Lifestones were key, and the road was the safest path. We were fleet of
      foot and sound o.....</p>
      <p>&quot;GO GO GO GO GO&quot;, Hearding was yelling.</p>
      <p>&quot;FOLLOW ME, IM THE BOSS DAMMIT&quot;, I yelled to my fellows, and
      we were off. Over hill and over dale we ran. It was a nonstop train to the
      lifestone south of Shoushi and we were rolling thru! Our speed was
      frightening, and I was worried that we might scorch such a trail to Yanshi
      as to leave our opponents a clear path. So I did the only thing I could
      think of, I had my ISP dump me. Well, after a quick re-fellow, we once
      again took up the race. A single red phynos wasp challenged us, and it was
      brought down, kicking and screaming. I could see the fear in its wounded
      eyes as Hrothgar bent down and it let out a shrill cry as he plucked the
      wings from its still struggling body. We danced like pagans for the glory
      of our first trophy, and split a lamb in sacrifice to the gods. This was
      turning out just fine!&nbsp; Soon after, we lifestoned south of Shoushi
      and as we ran past, we hungrily eyed the portal to Yanshi, but carefully
      stuck to the road all the way to Sawato.</p>
      <p>&quot;Uhhh Hermes, this road is going southwest&quot; someone muttered.
      Sure enough, the road had taken a turn for the worse after our departure
      from Sawato. Being an Aluvian, I had absolutely no idea where the road
      led, and if we continued to follow it, we might very possibly end up in
      the Direlands.</p>
      <p>&quot;Hmmm&quot; I muttered as I peered out to the north. The dreaded
      swamp lay between us and Yanshi. Not a place for unarmored newbies, even
      with an average run of 110. &quot;Oh well&quot;, I thought to myself,
      &quot;at least im not the slowest one here&quot;. And without another
      thought, I plunged down the embankment and into the mire.</p>
      <p>It was as if I'd fallen into a cesspool. The stink of the marsh gas
      overwhelmed me almost instantly, and I fought with my stomach to show some
      good leadership skills. We plowed, hip deep, through the fetid pools,
      avoiding any and all nasties we came across. We plodded by Drudge Skulkers,
      and deftly avoided red phynos wasps, but the scenery was taking a definite
      turn for the worse. Soon there were wisps and mire wasps, bands of unruly
      mosswarts. We were leading a train of some of the most fearsome ghoulies a
      first level character could imagine, when suddenly, with a shriek of fear,
      Draynor was pulled down into the putrid sludge. With a quick look over my
      shoulder, I tossed all thoughts of loyalty out the window. A mosswart was
      holding Draynor's singed head in the air like some grotesque prize. I
      could almost imagine the maggots that were going to feast on is entrails.
      God I hate maggots.</p>
      <p>No sooner had we left Draynor’s corpse than the swamp ended. Hrothgar
      and I eyed each other ashamedly. The proverbial &quot;Run like screaming
      schoolgirls&quot; can leave one a little embarrassed. Suddenly, we got a
      tell from Draynor, &quot;My corpse has the wasp wing&quot;! Curses. Damn
      our confounded luck. Our only trophy lost in the mires. &quot;CRUEL GOD
      WHY ME?&quot; I yelled as I fell to my knees and shook my fists at the
      sky.</p>
      <p>&quot;Get up Hermes, you look like a fool&quot;, Hrothgar muttered to
      me. I wiped my damp eyes and regained my composure enough to stand.
      Hrothgar was eyeing me like he either wished he'd gone with Gingerbreadman,
      or died back there in the swamp with Draynor. We told Draynor to run like
      the wind and meet us in Yanshi. We'd try to claim as many goodies as we
      could without him. Oh for some portal magic!</p>
      <p>Hrothgar and I arrived in Yanshi, lifestoned to the west, and then the
      hunt began. Drudges and Shreths, all of the lesser varieties, fell to our
      blades. We had all save the skewer and the drudge charm by the time
      Draynor arrived, but things were looking grim, and time was running short.
      We decided to check town for the skewer, unaware that the cursed Lurky had
      already <a href="rlh/index.html">bought the store out!</a> As we entered
      Yanshi, we saw a large hullabaloo going on near the towering rock. My
      fears were confirmed as I watched our underhanded opponents dancing naked
      with reckless abandon around the trophy collector, Hearding. &quot;DAMN
      YOUR EYES&quot;, I yelled. &quot;DAMN YOUR EYES&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
      <br>
      Well at least Putty got a consolation prize:<br>
      MY VASSAL WENT TO THE FIRST ANNUAL VR RUN FOR YOUR LIVES AND ALL I GOT WAS
      THIS STINKING TUNIC.<br>
      <br>
      I hate losing! Bah!</font>
