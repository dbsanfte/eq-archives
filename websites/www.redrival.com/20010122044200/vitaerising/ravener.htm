      <font size="5" face="Arial"><b>The Ravener</b></font><br>
      <font size="3" face="Arial">by Monster Baiter</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I
      wanderd, weak and weary,<br>
      Through many a quaint and curious dungon floor,<br>
      While I stoped, to do some napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
      As of some one gently rapping, rapping on a dungon door.<br>
      &quot;'Tis some drudge,&quot; I muttered, &quot;tapping at a dungon door-<br>
      Only this, and nothing more.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the Darkened Halls,<br>
      And each separate dying drudge wrought its loot upon the floor.<br>
      Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
      From my fighting surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Yoroi of Frore-<br>
      For the rare and radiant armor whom the ancients name Yoroi of Frore-<br>
      Lost here for evermore.<br>
      <br>
      And the silken sad uncertain rustling of my purple tunic<br>
      Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
      So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>
      &quot;'Tis some drudge entreating entrance at this chambers door-<br>
      Some late spawn entreating entrance at this chambers door;-<br>
      This it is, and nothing more.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
      &quot;sneaker&quot; said I, &quot;or prowler, truly you I did not ignore;<br>
      But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
      And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at this chambers door,<br>
      That I scarce was sure I heard you&quot;- here I opened wide the door;-<br>
      Darkness there, and nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
      Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br>
      But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
      And the only word there spoken was the whispered words, &quot;Yoroi of
      Frore!&quot;<br>
      This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the words, &quot;Yoroi of
      Frore!&quot;-<br>
      Merely this, and nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
      Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>
      &quot;Surely,&quot; said I, &quot;surely that is something at the gate
      behind me:<br>
      Let me see, then, what there at is, and this mystery explore-<br>
      Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-<br>
      'Tis the wind and nothing more.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Open here I flung the gate, when, with many a skitt and Scuttle,<br>
      In there stepped a stately ravener of the saintly days of Frore;<br>
      Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
      But, with mien of lord or lady, stood in front the chamber door-<br>
      Stood upon a pile of phat free loot just infront the chamber door-<br>
      Stood, then sat, and nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      Then this bipedal creature beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
      By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.<br>
      &quot;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&quot; I said, &quot;art
      sure no craven,<br>
      Ghastly grim and ancient ravener wandering from the Nightly shore-<br>
      Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!&quot;<br>
      Quoth the Ravener, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Much I marvelled this ungainly creature to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
      Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;<br>
      For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
      Ever yet was blest with seeing ravener sit upon a chamber floor-<br>
      Man or beast upon the loot infront a chamber door,<br>
      With such name as &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      But the ravener, sitting lonely on the placid loot, spoke only<br>
      That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
      Nothing further then he uttered- not a wisper then he muttered-<br>
      Till I scarcely more than muttered, &quot;other friends have died before-<br>
      On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have died before.&quot;<br>
      Then the ravener said, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
      &quot;Doubtless,&quot; said I, &quot;what it utters is its only stock and
      store,<br>
      Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
      Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-<br>
      Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
      Of 'Never- nevermore'.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      But the Ravener still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br>
      Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of Ravener, and loot and
      door;<br>
      Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
      Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous Ravener of Frore-<br>
      What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous beast of Frore<br>
      Meant in croaking &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
      To the beast whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>
      This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
      On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>
      But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,<br>
      She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br>
      <br>
      Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
      Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
      &quot;Wretch,&quot; I cried, &quot;thy God hath lent thee- by these angels
      he hath sent thee<br>
      Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Yoroi of Frore!<br>
      Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Yoroi of Frore!&quot;<br>
      Quoth the Ravener, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil!- prophet still, if beast
      or devil!-<br>
      Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
      Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-<br>
      On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-<br>
      Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!&quot;<br>
      Quoth the Ravener, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil- prophet still, if beast
      or devil!<br>
      By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-<br>
      Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
      It shall clasp a sacred armor whom the ancients name Yoroi of Frore-<br>
      Clasp a rare and radiant armor whom the ancients name Yoroi of Frore.&quot;<br>
      Quoth the Ravener, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Be that word our sign in parting, beast or fiend,&quot; I shrieked,
      upstarting-<br>
      &quot;Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>
      Leave no black loot as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
      Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the loot infront the chamber door!<br>
      Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!&quot;<br>
      Quoth the Ravener, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      And the Ravener, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
      On the pallid loot just infront the chamber door;<br>
      And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>
      And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
      And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
      Shall be lifted- nevermore!</font>
