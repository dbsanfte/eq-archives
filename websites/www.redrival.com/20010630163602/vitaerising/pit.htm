      <b><font face="Arial" size="4">The Pit<br>
      </font></b><font face="Arial" size="3">by Zaketh<br>
      28 November 1999</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It was another fine day in Dereth that
      found myself, Putty, and Dany in Stonehold. We had trekked here to
      adventure in the dungeon known as the pit. Little did we know that we
      would be cursing it as the Pit of Hell.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Our trip up while long had some minor
      adventures. However, after visiting Stonehold Lifestone we set upon the
      trail to the pit. Btw, these Lifestones are notorious gossips. Not 2
      seconds after attuning putty and me are made fun of by the lifestone and
      how he hopes to see us a few times. I resemble…oops resent that comment.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We reached the entrance in short order and
      found it empty of guards. For some reason I don’t like something that
      isn’t defended. It either means that what’s in there isn’t worth
      anything or its so nasty it doesn’t need guards.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Again, I have the hackles rise on my neck
      and misjudge it for battle fever instead of premonition of imminent vitae.
      You would think I would have learned this by now…makes me wonder if my
      helmet really does protect my head.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Well upon entering we find there are many
      many monougas on many levels. Of course a welcoming committee of about 4
      Rough Monougas try to give us their weapons in an aggressive display of
      niceness. “Oh thank <b>&lt;ouch&gt; </b>you &lt;ouch&gt;, be careful
      &lt;ouch&gt; you could put someone’s eye out with that &lt;ouch&gt;.”,
      that’s when Dany roles her eyes and says they are guards.
      Oh…sorry…then I lay into them and slaughter the whole bunch for their
      deceit.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The trip down the levels mainly consisted
      of this practice of finding a whole bunch of monougas and inserting iron
      into their diet. Putty and Dany are two true companions a tank really
      likes to have. Especially seeing as they keeps this tanks keister guarded.
      We hacked and slashed our way down down down the many levels. On the way
      many close fights were fought with many Rough, Crude, and Wild Monougas
      cursing our names to their many many deaths. Along the way two weak and
      piddly cousins of the Skel Mines Skeleton Lord got in our way and we
      dispatched them with ease. They call themselves lords they should be
      ashamed of themselves. We continued our downward trek with much decent
      loot gathering.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Little did we know the one female on the
      trek was in for a surprise near the bottom. It seems Wild Monougas had
      gotten satellite and DirectTV out in the sticks. They all seemed to be
      great soccer fans too. Because they treated Dany like a soccer ball and
      sent her through the goal (lifestone). I hope these guys aren’t Rockette
      fans too. Many would flee in fear of a line of high stepping Monougas.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Being so far down in the dungeon myself and
      putty continued down to the exit portal at the bottom. I did jump and head
      down to the portal room dodging many spells cast my way. There while
      narrowly dodging flung spells and many many skeletons I did spy the true
      master of this fell place. He was the “Revenant”. Well lucky for me I
      have practiced the run like a school girl maneuver extensively and was
      able to lure most away from the exit so I could duck back in and get out.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While waiting for the return of my intrepid
      companion Dany putty succumbed to Monougas in his failed attempt to return
      the way we came. Sigh hardly here an hour and two deaths. We are getting
      really good at this. So when we were gathered again we did set into the
      dungeon again and did thus make havoc on the way down. Along the way
      another group of hardy adventurers did pass us by. We did pass them and
      fell in beside and thus a great battle took place with many Wild Monougas
      who had watched too much soccer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">During this grand melee with spells,
      blades, and blood a flying did I find myself the soccer ball of a Wild
      Monouga. Man they kick hard. Made me feel like a drudge. Thus I was forced
      to execute a run like a school girl maneuver. But alas my mighty companion
      Putty fought to save me from this Pele of the Monougas. Little effect did
      this have on the monouga because he kicked me right to the lifestone.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Brrr….where is that draft coming
      from….HEY!….where’s all my armor. Thus I said while covering myself
      from a snickering Lifestone. I swear this one had a rotten attitude. After
      using choice language to stem the snickering, which failed, I retreated to
      town to replace my armor.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While I was flashing the lifestone Putty
      was able to recover his items from a corpse of his. Dany was also lucky to
      recover her stuff too. Thus after purchasing MUCH inflated platemail…damn
      sticks vendors think they can gouge adventurers because the nearest
      competition is miles away….the nerve. I digress though.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Upon entering the pit again I was told by
      my companions that they would work up while I work down. Well along the
      way the Revenant cast a lag spell on me and I was set upon by packs of
      evil monougas. HA! I escaped two of these evil traps. I was feeling good
      so I continued along the way…that is when the last vile trap was sprang
      on me. There I was running for my life when Putty tells me Dany had
      succumbed to a pack of Wilds and he was running for his life. Damn the
      irony. Again heading down with many fell creatures a following I did get
      cornered a final time and was giving a trip to the smart-ass lifestone.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Of course by the time we get there he is
      still laughing at Dany rendition of a soccer ball. When I appear he goes
      into unintelligible howls of laughter. The nerve of some Lifestones. Well
      this time I was fully clothed just missing choice items.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At this point Dany had lost much armor that
      was replaced by some highly inflated plate. Bet that vendor saw us coming.
      Greedy Aluvians! Much was done to lighten Dany’s load so she was not
      carrying too much. Alas putty was to soon join us in town after making it
      to the site of my most recent death.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">For the third time we did venture into this
      festering pit. I must confess the Revenant runs a tighter ship than the
      Skel Lord out in his mine. I mean this place was nasty compared to the
      mine. After much fighting Putty and me did retrieve our gear.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After this we did proceed to fight its way
      down again with many close calls to our lives. Shortly after recovering
      our companion Dany’s things we were set upon by Pele monouga again. Alas
      before we could dispatch this soccer playing monouga Dany fell again and
      was to weary to continue.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Putty and me pressed on to the site of my
      first death. Dangit I had some sweet armor I wanted back. After some
      conjoling Putty and me continued on cautiously fighting and winning our
      way close. There we were in the hall to the room where I died. Thus we
      played a cautious game of bait the monouga.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Well it didn’t work. There we were set
      upon by three of the pains in the butt. Unfortunately, after dispatching
      one together we split our attention. Wouldn’t you know I get the soccer
      fan. Well I taught this soccer fan what’s what. Putty on the other hand
      was forced to execute a running schoolgirl maneuver. After dispatching
      soccer boy I healed and went to rescue putty. I succeeded in delaying the
      monouga but before Putty could realize he was safe another Monouga sent
      him packing. After dispatching the last Monouga I retrieved my sweet
      armor.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At this point putty too weary from the
      fight had to bow out. There I was alone in a hostile pit. What is a tank
      to do. Well I will tell you what I did. I ran my ass off to get out. There
      is where I met two nice people who had cleared the way for me with out
      knowing it. I love adventuring mages and archers who make it easier for me
      to escape. After much profuse shoe kissing and thank you’s I made my
      escape back to Stonehold where I got a cool drink and reflected on the
      long bad day I just had.</font>
