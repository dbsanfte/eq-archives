<h1>Stardate .01062001</h1>

<p align="left">Medical Officer Reporting<br>
Planet Frostfell<br>
Mayoi Outpost<br>
VR Dweebs Section</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am concerned about the Captain’s mental and physical well being.&nbsp; This concern has been building over time.&nbsp;
It came
to an ultimate climax on our last assignment Stardate .12301999.</p>

<p>The VR Dweeb section was ordered to clear the woods of hostile non-sentient life forms from the outposts of Mayoi and Kara. 
This planet of Frostfell has recently submitted application to the Federation as you know, so we are helping the locals to settle 
their vast wilderness.&nbsp; This will also help Starfleet Corp
of Engineers to come in and mine for Dylithium Crystals.</p>

<p>A
Starfleet Earth holiday called “New Years Eve” was due to start the following
day of our cleanup.&nbsp; However, Captain Hearding decided to start celebrating a
tad early.&nbsp; As we waited for several minutes to see if any other VR’s would
volunteer he announced he was going to start drinking Vodka.</p>

<p>This
is a powerful depressant, slowing attack response and cognitive abilities, but
we didn’t think much of it. It was a simple hunt and kill and with myself
healing the frequent <b>“Boo Boos”</b>,
Lieutenants Rabbitsbane as Navigator, Lieutenant Chan Tatao as Weapons Officer,
and Ensign Kensai (new to the VR establishment) acting as security chief, we
all felt confident that we could handle this clean out.</p>

<p>Well
as no other volunteers showed up, we quickly made use of the new transporter
technology, code name <b>LifeStone</b>, and
got started.&nbsp; We made our way past the standard wild animals without a problem.</p>

<p>Even
the mutant Tribbles here that the locals call Mattekars didn’t present much of
a problem.&nbsp; Even though their overdeveloped since of smell makes them intolerant
not only of Klingons but also humans, we were able to quickly dispatch them.&nbsp;
I made a mental note that the war souvenirs on these are much worse since the
snow began to fall.</p>

<p>At
about 7 clicks out from the LifeStone we began to run across mutant Cro-Magnon
men, the kind that were encountered when the Enterprise’s shuttle Galileo crash 
landed with Commander Spock. The locals here call them Lugians.&nbsp; These ones don’t 
throw spears but <b>big boulders</b>. “UGH,” I heard Chan and
Rabbitsbane let out cries of pain, but with my superior healing skills and long
distance medikit sprays I was able to heal everyone.&nbsp; I did quite well I
thought.</p>

<p>I began noticing at this point that Captain Hearding was
throwing himself at any and every creature we came across.&nbsp; Even innocent
rabbits! His wanton destruction made it necessary to have me cast him with
armor and regenerating to keep him alive. </p>

<p>“Captain Hearding, please stay NEAR the group so I can regenerate my medikit please,” I
shouted numerous times.</p>

<p>It was at this point I began to see something ominous on the horizon.&nbsp; A little voice started 
ticking in my brain.&nbsp; Vodka is Russian…. <b>Russian sounds like….
ROMULAN!</b>&nbsp; I don’t know, maybe it was the strain of my concern for him.</p>

<p>As we were lead over a hill at about
10 clicks out we quickly dispatched some Horta mutants called K’naths.&nbsp; They do
wiggle and jiggle and have the consistency of Jell-O but they can run over
anything and acidize them like their Horta cousins.&nbsp; But these critters are not
tame, and instead of helping us mine crystals, they spit spells like rocket launchers.
I think they were Hortas that got loose and bred in the wild and decided they
had enough with us using them as slave labor!</p>

<p>I got pretty hurt but thanks to the
quick action and emergency medical training of the navigator Rabbitsbane I
survived.&nbsp; Then came the wild stray Armoredillos.&nbsp; Imported by many Texans these
guys have been sucking the same radiation tinged rivers as the Hortas.&nbsp; BZZZZZ&nbsp;
I
would hear, “AHHH,” as I took a good hit.&nbsp; This is where I did the classically
and perfected <b> “Scream like a school
girl”</b> move that VR is renowned for.&nbsp; Thanks to the quick actions and archery
skill of Kensei and Chan, the Rabbitsbane and were saved. Whew.</p>

<p>Captain
Hearding stumbled up the rest of the slope and leaning over them said, “Hum,
tough little buggerss huh? Here have a sssip of thisss and you’lllll be much
betterrrr.”&nbsp; I swear I saw him pour Romulan Ale (It was blue) on the corpses!</p>

<p>Then true disaster struck.&nbsp; Captain
Hearding went tumbling down the hill and as Rabbitsbane went running after.&nbsp;
The
rest of us ran down when she ran smack dab into the hated <b>ZEFIR PACK!</b></p>

<p>Well I
stupidly thought I could tank Kilif while the others helped.&nbsp; Unknown to me at
the time, there were three of the buggers and I was the only one tanking the
Kilif while the other VR’s were hitting Zofrit and Jibrit his big and little
brothers, respectively.</p>

<p>Captain Hearding, well he went stumbling around the Zefirs doing a <b> “Bet you can’t catch me,”
</b> 
dance.</p>

<p>“ARGGGHHHH,”
I screamed, then Booom Whiiirrrrrr!&nbsp; I knew the sound.&nbsp; The LifeStone Transporter
Recall had been activated.&nbsp; Well it regenerated my body quickly enough, however
it left me with the normal slight weakness.&nbsp; Then I realized I hadn’t set myself
to the Mayoi LifeStone!&nbsp; I panicked and used my Transporter Recall II, a.k.a.
Portal Recall, and was back in Mayoi. </p>

<p>At
the same time I got the messages…. “<b>Your fellow Rabbitsbane has died, Your
fellow Chan Tatao has died.</b>”&nbsp; We all
let out a shout for joy.&nbsp; As with our tradition it is not a true Vitae Rising
event if the new LifeStone technology is NOT put to the full test.&nbsp; A pause
ensued then “<b>Your fellow Hearding has died</b>.”&nbsp; Hum, a Zefir conspiracy.</p>

<p>I
pleaded with the others to wait up, but they were off chasing the now <b>NAKED Captain Hearding</b> as he ran
gleefully through the snow back to his body!&nbsp; I panicked. “HELP HELP”&nbsp;
I
shouted.&nbsp; I felt like one of those
damsels in distress in the old 1920’s movies.&nbsp; I was on the railroad track
calling while the train kept coming,&nbsp; “Help Help, oh my Help I say.”</p>

<p>I
asked for coordinates three times.&nbsp; Rabbitsbane found another pack of Zefirs
waiting for us and she took her revenge upon them while Hearding, well he ran
around in circles naked.&nbsp; Chan Tatao was kind enough to come to my aid. I was SO
alone in the wilderness.&nbsp; Then it happened again.</p>

<p>“Your fellow Hearding has died.” Seems he got speared in
the back by a group of Mosswarts. </p>

<p>“Not
quite the way I planned to die. Not real heroic is it?” he said.&nbsp; We collected
he and Rabbitsbane and began a run back to Kensei, who was the only one not to
die on our little run in with the Zefirs.</p>

<p align="center">

<img
src="image001.jpg" width="377" height="339">

<p>Well
we regrouped and picked up our belongings.&nbsp; I’d like to mention now that the
recall LifeStone still needs some touch up.&nbsp; It leaves behind some much needed
items.&nbsp; It’s an inconvenience but does make it so that we don’t really like the
idea of LifeStone recalling.&nbsp; I just would like to have the Corp of Engineers
look into that little glitch.</p>

<p>At
this point, I began to theorize that <b>Captain
Hearding is not only a Romulan but he’s CRAZY!</b>&nbsp; He decided at this point that
armor was still unnecessary.&nbsp; Yes I tried to remind him he’d already died twice.&nbsp;
We could not get him to put on clothing, so our group ran up the hill.</p>

<p>VR
found a PRIME spawning point of mutant Cro-Magnon men.&nbsp; On the other side of the
hill the K’nath Hortas were shooting rockets over our heads.&nbsp; It was quite a
scene.&nbsp; It was then, that I remembered that I was suppose to be taking pictures
for training purposes.&nbsp; I missed the opportunity though when Captain Hearding
ran down into the spawning point of Lugians.</p>

<p>I
had been occupied by the pretty <b>
“Screaming Like A School Girl” </b> dance of Rabbitsbane and was healing her. I
didn’t notice Captain Hearding alone naked and down by the Lugians when “Your
fellow Hearding has died”.&nbsp; I looked down and there he was.&nbsp; His corpse was being
thrown into the fire and roasted on a spit by these creatures.&nbsp; What was left
was being stomped on.</p>

<p>Our
group was a good 15 clicks out of Mayoi.&nbsp; We regrouped and while waiting for the
captain, Ensign Kensei announced that he was out of ammunition and needed to
return to a supply depot.&nbsp; He put on his super Nikes, the ones with Fleet Footed
II Power Up, and he ran for much needed supplies.</p>

<p>Waiting
waiting waiting, Hearding finally showed and we got his armor.&nbsp; At this point
Chan Tatao reminded us of the time and we decided to run for Kara.&nbsp; We were out
of time to finish the clean up, and with the Captains condition getting worse,
well…we were undermanned as well.&nbsp; So after Kensei ran off we decided to go
ahead and run forward to meet him, big mistake.</p>

<p>I
got hit with some sort of <b>Temporal
Displacement</b>, the locals call it LAG.&nbsp; As the naked Hearding ran forward,
the noble Rabbitsbane tried to follow. When I came out of my state I saw “Your
fellow Rabbitsbane, Your fellow Hearding” and then I see Chan running.&nbsp; I
started to kill the evil Zefir but was screaming “HELP HELP.”</p>

<p>I
survived then harassed Chan with, “Why didn’t you help me?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t,” he said putting a medikit to his head.&nbsp; I
saw he was hurt badly. “So that’s why you ran!” I said.&nbsp; I felt bad.&nbsp;
I healed
him up.&nbsp; As Zefirs, Shreths and Mosswarts spawned near the bodies of RB and
Heard, we kept the area clear.&nbsp; I was panicking, hoping Kensei’s power up would
get him back soon.</p>

<p align="center"><img
src="image003.jpg" width="480" height="400"></p>

<p>Luckily
RB had enough command experience to power up herself and Hearding.&nbsp; At this
point the Captain came up with a brilliant idea.<b> “Hum maybe I should put some clothes on.”</b> We died laughing. He
said he’d switch to water to clear his mind up. Secretly I think he got a
transmission from Romulan space while I was lagging and they told him I was
suspicious.&nbsp; You know those Romulans, they have perfected the <b>“Long Distance Mind Melding Technique”</b>
and I KNOW they were reading my thoughts!</p>

<p>While Chan and I were waiting I couldn’t help myself.&nbsp; “Hey Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of my cowl.” Hehe </p>

<p>Someone
came back with “Silly Rabbit, Zefirs are for kids.” I was wondering where her
lucky rabbit foot was when I realized the Zefirs had it.&nbsp; I’ve heard another
famous warrior claim that he’s “What’s for dinner” regarding Zefirs but I KNOW
they prefer rabbit meat.&nbsp; Our navigator and Zephirs have a thing for each other.
<b>She must be wearing “Tenderize Me
Cologne.”</b></p>

<p>Hearding
got his clothes and Rabbitsbane recollected herself just when Kensei came over
the mountain.&nbsp; We all got powered up Nikes thanks to RB, and ran. As we stopped
to get powered up again we saw a two building village and though it wasn’t near
the coordinates of Kara, we ran to it in hopes of rest.</p>

<p>I
was in the building first when I heard the distinct sound of the <b>UNDEAD!</b> I got the message “You evaded
Lich Lord.” I screamed to the group, “LICH LICH LICH. Run, stay away.”</p>

<h2>Captain Hearding yelled, “It’s a trap!”</h2>

<p>We
got out of there fast. I ran so far, the others had to catch up! Then RB
spotted her archenemy the Zefirs.&nbsp; Unfortunately she lost the battle again.&nbsp;
Then
Chan stated he had to go and ran toward Kara.&nbsp; We regrouped again and RB found
her body.&nbsp; As we were running to town Chan announced he too was hit with a time
warp.&nbsp; He was <b>“stuck on a mountain and
couldn’t get up!”</b></p>

<p>Sounded like a commercial for “Transporter
Aid.&nbsp; We come to your rescue. Just hit your transponder.”&nbsp; You know the one.</p>

<p>As
we were running we saw him running in place.&nbsp; With a quick transporter shift,
a.k.a. relog, he was back with us.&nbsp; We ran through the most gorgeous part of the
island at this point.&nbsp; We ran past lakes, ocean ports, and up mountains with a
waterfall.&nbsp; RB had to lead us up the <b>“Cliffs
of Insanity.”</b></p>

<p>Then we found them.&nbsp; Hearding’s archenemy, the evil
Snowman pod!&nbsp; We made quick work of them and as I ate my carrots we looked over
the horizon.&nbsp; It was a gorgeous view. We finally made it to Kara. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="image005.jpg" width="277" height="46"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="image006.jpg" width="424" height="300">

<p align="center"><img src="image012.jpg" width="379" height="375"></p>

<p>Then
the captain proceeded to strip naked and make a snow angel!&nbsp; We were all
exhausted so we joined in.&nbsp; Nice picture I think.&nbsp; Well anyway, this is my
report.&nbsp; I feel it a great responsibility to have the captain take a forced
leave of absence.&nbsp; He tested the LifeStone technology a total of four times.&nbsp;
Rabbitsbane came a close three, all by Zefirs. Chan and I died only the one
time.&nbsp; <b>Ensign Kensei Sansui deserves a
medal.</b> He never died!</p>
