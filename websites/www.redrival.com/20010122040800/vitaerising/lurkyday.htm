      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>A
      Day In The Life Of Lurky The Lost</b></font><br>
      <font face="Arial" size="3">by Lurky The Lost</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">It
      started last Friday, that was the date<br>
      When she decided things must change from the current rate<br>
      For her Baron was mighty, known through the realm<br>
      She had great envy of his ability to get the Olthoi helm</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">How does he do it? How can this be?<br>
      To have such great power, and not suck like me?<br>
      It must be the robe, the one that’s all green<br>
      The whisper came forth, in her mind she had seen</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">She would have this power, she would have this great
      might<br>
      The green robe would be hers, it would be in her sight<br>
      But how do I get this? I know not the quest<br>
      But it’s Kilk you should be talking too, he knows all the best</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">So Saturday the 27<sup>th</sup> I asked him with
      glee<br>
      “The secret of Frore will you teach me?”<br>
      “Ofcourse,” he said. “You must do just this.<br>
      Run to the second stone, and the letter you won’t miss”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">So handing me the book, that he had made<br>
      Of his previous adventure to Frore and the raid<br>
      Where he had died, just after getting the lewt<br>
      And the Gelidite Lord had turned him into a newt</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Yes Kilk had died with all but the robe<br>
      The Baron had it, in it he now strode<br>
      So a return trip was planned, Kilk was quite willing<br>
      Of finding phat lewt, in the frost we’d go milling</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">But first we must have two Lich Lord seals<br>
      While Kilk and I ate online our evening meals<br>
      The Monarch instead went out for Chinese<br>
      Oaf was the only one, who could take off with ease</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">He had one of these seals from a Lich Lord<br>
      But only he could kill one, and vitae WE could not afford<br>
      So after dinner and a great deal of lag<br>
      Oaf returned and tried to find this bag</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">But the booty did not give up without a fight<br>
      The Lich Lords had killed him off with might<br>
      So another day in the week he would return<br>
      To seek a 2<sup>nd</sup> seal, those Liches would burn!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The Lich Lords would pay, each and everyone<br>
      But now for the key of Frore, we had none<br>
      So camping monoliths 2 and 3<br>
      2 copies of each transcript we got, Kilk and me</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Oaf would return during the week and would try<br>
      To kill more Lich Lords, oh man they would fry!<br>
      The date was set, on April first<br>
      For Frore how we had such a great thirst</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">During the week Oaf tried as he could<br>
      No seal had been given as it should<br>
      So a copy of each transcript, I had<br>
      Except for the first, and we were quite mad</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">During the week I went forth with Zaketh and glee<br>
      To the transcriber in Zaikhal we went, he and me<br>
      We got one complete list of portal coords<br>
      To give to the lady at the plateau with some words</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The party was planned for each and everyone<br>
      Kilk, Chan, Zaketh, Lurky and the Lumbering one<br>
      But then it struck on Friday night<br>
      Kilk had something come up in real life</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">A postpone was put forth on April Fool’s day<br>
      Perhaps a good omen, what can you say?<br>
      So Sunday morning at eleven I turned on<br>
      The computer of which I am so fond</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">It reminded me this, it reminded me well<br>
      It’s Daylight Savings Time day, oh Hell!<br>
      The party was set, it was set today<br>
      “Oh god I hope they know the time change, NO WAY!”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">But everyone showed, every last one<br>
      Everyone was ready to have lots of fun<br>
      Dany had joined us, and we muled with delight<br>
      We didn’t want to loose any goodies tonight</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">So Zaketh the mighty Sorceror indeed<br>
      Pulled up a portal to Plateau without heed<br>
      To transport there swiftly, oh yes<br>
      Running up there would have been quite a mess</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">So quickly we entered, and Zaketh did change<br>
      To his melee character, no longer the sage<br>
      I buffed and hit everyone for cold<br>
      I and Oaf knew the magic, all were told</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">“If the magic wears out, I gotta know”<br>
      “If you die inside, you get portaled pronto”<br>
      So everyone was careful, and I asked Kilk<br>
      “Do I give this transcription to the chick in the silk?”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">“Yes,” was the reply from all that were there<br>
      “Are you all ready?” I asked with my hands in my hair<br>
      Oh I must have this goody, I must have the robe<br>
      I want to be known like my Monarch, throughout the globe</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">So in we went and we noticed with glee<br>
      Frore was empty, it was just we<br>
      All the kills and phat lewt were ours to share<br>
      Everyone got something but Oaf, which was unfair</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There was not enough for everyone in the room<br>
      Dany got from Frore the great Ice Heaume<br>
      Chan got the Ice Hammer of Frore<br>
      Kilk got a great bow of war</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Zaketh got the huge blue shield<br>
      And all the melees, got healing kits for the field<br>
      Then Oaf gave me a staff just like his<br>
      Oh how thankful I was at such a great wiz!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">A great Monarch he is, to be so kind<br>
      Such a Monarch is such a truly rare find<br>
      And so it began the rest of the evening<br>
      “Level Chan,” was the cry, death was just beginning</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">For Chan was close to getting Item Enchantment<br>
      The rest of the evening was set in encampment<br>
      Of the South Dires Portal we all did travel<br>
      To get spit out by golems, and gromnies like gravel</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Try as I might I simply couldn’t tank<br>
      Like the great one in green with such a high rank<br>
      So the plans did change, and Kilk did thus<br>
      He kept letting them all hit him, just like a bus</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">“Heal!” was the should I kept hearing<br>
      As the gromnies, all ash just kept appearing<br>
      We really needed help, we really kept trying<br>
      So unlike Oaf, all I did was keep dying</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">I called Oaf for help but Kilk was reminding<br>
      Oaf was playing another character, unwinding<br>
      “He’s called for help time and again.<br>
      He rarely gets to play like a normal kinsmen.”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">“So leave him alone,” was the Kilk shout<br>
      He was right ofcourse, but I had my doubts<br>
      I die so easily, the green robe didn’t change<br>
      All of these creatures are way out of my range!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">But alas we progressed, and sometimes we fellowed<br>
      To get Lurkys vitae down, as “LEVEL CHAN” was bellowed<br>
      Once the vitae was gone, Chan was once again alone<br>
      For me to heal he and Kilk on my own</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Then later that night Pele did return<br>
      To arrive in time to watch me get burned<br>
      The vitae was returned, and Kilk got some too<br>
      Those damn gromnies attacked as we ran out of view</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We accidentally left, Chan behind<br>
      His stamina had run out, and was in a bind<br>
      So returning from the stone we did<br>
      Another fellowship we had bid</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Again the vitae went down<br>
      “LEVEL CHAN” shouted round<br>
      So by eleven I got my third death<br>
      I ran back from Mayoi, about out of breath</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Just then I heard it, the sound so sweet<br>
      WOOSH went Chan, oh it was so neat!<br>
      He glowed and then we all said together<br>
      “Let’s get the hell out of here and into fair weather!”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">So this I have learned though it really bites<br>
      The only great mage, Olthoi he smites<br>
      The green doesn’t do it, it’s the person inside<br>
      There’s only one Lumbering Oaf, that I can’t deride!</font>
