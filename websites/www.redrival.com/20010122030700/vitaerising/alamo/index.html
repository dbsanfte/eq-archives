      <font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Last Stand at Fort Alamo: views of a Tank<br>
      </b></font><font face="Arial" size="3">by Zaketh<br>
      11 November 1999</font>
      <p><font face="Arial">Once again it was time to answer the call of Vitae
      Rising. This time we met in Holtburg with vague plans of going and
      depopulating the countryside. Last week's record attendance was shattered
      with 3 new additions to this week's trek of mayhem and vitae. In addition
      to our reluctant leader Hearding (he tries to deny it), Bruised Lee, Chan
      Tatao (who is late due to work?), myself (Zaketh), Lumbering Oaf, Jin Lee,
      Kilk, Putty, and Han Fu we had the additions of Odyssey, Baru
      Serpentslayer, and Samson al-Khalif. Watch these new ones they are up and
      comers as far as rising vitae is concerned.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="alamo7.jpg" width="298" height="28"></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">A great discussion was brewing on what to do and
      which direction our depopulation efforts would take when someone spoke up
      with a good idea. It seems there was a fort in the mountains to the north
      that guarded a pass into the Northern Aluvian lands. Jin had gotten word
      they were making a desperate stand against forces of Banderlings insistent
      on breaking through and raising havoc.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Well Jin Lee being a stunning mage surprises us all
      and opens a portal that’s all white that whisks us to the floor of the
      great crater to the north. Dang mages are so convenient. Upon reaching
      this destination we are still waiting for Chan…. Guess work sucks,
      whatever that is. We all go snoop…oops wandering around the area and use
      the local lifestone. While waiting Bruised Lee and me get bored and start
      looking for something to kill. Well we found it…or it found us in the
      form of a pair of ugly Tuskers. At which point our fellowship descended
      upon the poor Tuskers and wiped them out. When you got 12 people there
      isn’t much to worry about.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">After that Chan shows and we follow Jin out of the
      crater. Upon exit some Banderlings and a few mites sprang a vile trap on
      us. They were probably sent as a delaying action.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">I hate mites. They remind me of a four-legged
      creature that haunted my dreams as a child. This yapping beast had four
      legs and ball shaped areas of fur and while small was disturbing to say
      the least.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="alamo1.jpg" align="left" width="404" height="183">Well
      to make a long story short we beat the tar out of this ambush. Alas poor
      Samson had fallen in the fight. The stupid mite had made a beeline for the
      young mage and gave him an express visit to the lifestone.&nbsp; While
      Samson caught up all manners of theories on mage attraction in mites were
      discussed with a final conclusion being summed up by the Axeman Kilk.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Once Samson returned we continued on to the Fort and
      just a couple of valleys over we once again were set upon by tuskers. I
      was like…Woohoo! More easy fodder for the kill! Dangit don’t you hate
      it when you are wrong. One minute we were fighting the next someone yells
      “Theres a Goldenback”. Well I am an expert fighter I searched out this
      Goldenback and set upon him to show him his error in attacking us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="alamo3b.jpg" align="right" width="271" height="67">
      Damnit!!…I hate irony. Howdy there Mr. Lifestone how's it going…yeah
      those Goldenbacks are a little much aren’t they. While I was getting my
      wits back Lumbering Oaf is given the same free ride to the Lifestone as
      me.&nbsp;Well we start heading back and when we get there everyone has
      safely broken off and we are able to recover our items off our bodies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="alamo4.jpg" width="290" height="18">&nbsp;
      Well I was hell bent on getting revenge. No one slaps me around like a
      Drudge and gets away with it when I have 11 people backing me up. After
      getting a plan together we hit the Goldenback first. Oh btw while I was
      conversing with Mr. LS a Female Crimson Tusker makes an appearance to help
      her mate with pesky adventurers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">HA HA!!! We showed them what we were made of, at
      least in large gangs that is. The Goldenback and Crimson fell before us
      and thanks to the Mages we were spared visits to Mr. LS.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">After much celebrating, looting of corpses, and pats
      on the backs we stopped to reflect on the scene of this fight. Odyssey
      then made an observation that dampened the mood for about 5 seconds before
      more celebrating continued.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="alamo5.jpg" width="749" height="282"></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Time being of the essence and us still needing to
      get to the fort before it fell we had to continue our trek across the
      valleys and snow covered forests. Needless to say if you listened closely
      you may have heard some low whining. Man we were passing some good
      killing. Jeez not to mention loot. It was tearing my warrior’s soul
      apart to pass by worthy adversaries.</font></p>
      <img border="0" src="alamo8.jpg" align="center" width="558" height="467">
      <p><font face="Arial">Along
      the way our line became ragged and stretched out so a break was called to
      get us all together again. After we regrouped we set off again, but I
      decided a little killing was in order and attacked a Snowy Mattekar. Come
      on you can’t blame me, can you? All run and no hack and slash makes
      Zaketh a grumpy tank.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Well you would think I had learned my lesson long
      ago. Needless to say before my stalwart companions could bail…. mean
      come to my aid I got to see as my last dying vision the Snowy Mattekar
      collapse under VR blades.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">DAMN!.. Howdy LS…. yeah I know it’s only been a
      bit since my last trip…no I don’t do it on purpose it just happens.
      Well I was way behind now and had to run to catch up. I even missed the
      brilliantly executed <i>Chicken with its Head Cutoff Maneuver</i>. I miss
      everything. Well when I finally reach the Lifestone near the fort the <i>Chicken
      with its Head Cutoff Maneuver</i> was coming to an end and everyone was
      forming up with only a few stragglers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There it stood on the hill to the northeast. While
      not much to look at it was a military mans dream…*sniff*…it brought a
      tear to my eye, either that or the stinging north wind, can’t tell when
      I get choked up like that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Well after that moment passed we ran to the defense
      of the fort and proceeded to teach Banderlings how to die in short order.
      This was a glorious battle where many were heroes and death was in the
      air. It was so tense you could almost taste the vitae.<img border="0" src="alamo9.jpg" align="right" width="354" height="337"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">While the fighters fought in the trenches the mages
      took to the parapets to rain death on Banderlings and to cast a timely
      heal to help the defenders throughout the fight. Here and there
      individuals did their best to stem the grim Banderling horde from
      succeeding. Little did we know that a bad omen was to walk our way.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="alamo13.jpg" width="191" height="18"></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">What? We asked. Bruised Lee explained it again in a
      lull in the fight. His woman said he had to go. Well when something like
      that happens what can you do? Nothing Dammit. Jin Lee whisked BL back to
      the crater so he could continue on to his woman. While there Jin went on a
      supplies run for the rest of us. Did I mention I love convenient mages?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Bruised Lee’s departure was a hit to morale. Doom
      and despair entered our ranks and the lines were threatened by this break.
      Then our reluctant leader stepped into the spotlight and gave a rousing
      speech that ended with a line being drawn and all who would cross it was
      to stand and kick Bander butt. Needless to say I was pushe…umm….first
      to cross the line and volunteer to stand and protect the fort. The others
      followed and we decided to stand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">While Jin was shopping we continued to repulse
      sporadic Bander attacks with our morale renewed.&nbsp; Many small raids
      were made and thus we were forced to run around and protect many fronts.
      Little did we know this was part of their diabolical plan to take the
      fort. When Jin returned we distributed supplies and continued the defense.&nbsp;
      At this time the massive wave attacks of the Banderlings were renewed. We
      met them and held thanks to our newfound morale and supplies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="alamo10.jpg" align="left" width="462" height="272">However,
      while we fought their Tumerok masters had finished digging into the fort
      basement and set off their evil spell of LAG. Then the Tumeroks emerged
      from the basement and proceeded to throw us into chaos. Things got
      desperate for the defense. We were pushed to the limit and beyond. The
      main group of our defenders got separated and small groups fought on their
      own. There were Hearding and Chan Tatao guarding each other’s backs.
      Baru Serpentslayer, even though less experienced, threw his body
      repeatedly into the fight regardless of the danger and helped many to rest
      and repair armor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="alamo11.jpg" align="right" width="421" height="293">There was Odyssey and Han Fu cutting a swath thru
      the Banderlings and fighting Tumeroks all the time taking damage and
      sometimes dying and having to return to the fight a little less powerful
      but more determined.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Myself, Kilk, and putty fought a valiant defense of
      the stairs to the mages perch. During the fight we noticed two mages
      missing with Jin Lee being the only one left. When questioned she did not
      know when they had left.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Several attempts were made to push the Tumeroks out
      of the basement into their tunnels. The only thing accomplished was to
      push them down the stairs and leaving behind some of our bodies. Even
      though Vitae Rising was a mighty group we were outnumbered.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Slowly but surely the battle was being lost. The
      Tumeroks occasionally were pushed back and there were lulls in the battle
      in which we had to survey the situation. Then it was decided that we could
      no longer stand so we were forced to abandon the fort to the Tumeroks and
      their evil spell of LAG.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="alamo12.jpg" width="576" height="445"></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We fought our way out and were regrouping near the
      lifestone when I saw him. There he sat on a brilliant white stallion
      wearing brown leather armor and with a fur cap with a tail and a mask.
      “You did the Alamo proud son”, the figure said. I turned to my
      companions and told them to look. However, by the time I turned around
      again he was gone and I heard a faint “Hi ho Bowie!” I explained what
      I saw to Chan Tatao and all he did was look at me a little weird and
      looked at my helmet and asked if I hit my head or there were any dents in
      it. I tried to convince my companions of this masked man but they only
      rolled their eyes at me. I know the truth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">I looked once more and uttered, “Who was that
      masked man?”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">“Why that was the Lone Davy Crockett”, said a
      grizzled miner in a funny hat.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Again, I yelled for my companions to look and again
      he was gone with a voice in my head that told me, “Remember Fort
      Alamo”.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">After much looking over my head and helmet Jin
      opened another portal to the crater and thus we left the field of battle
      and left Fort Alamo to the Banderlings with vague promises of return</font></p>
