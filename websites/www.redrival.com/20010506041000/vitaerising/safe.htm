      <font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Safe Inside Incunabula<br>
      </b></font><font face="Arial" size="3">by Lumbering Oaf<br>
      24 March 2000</font>
      <p><font face="Arial">Materializing from a rather ugly shade of purple, Lumbering Oaf appeared
      underneath the spire of Eastham. He stood there for a minute, admiring his
      stylish green outfit and gloating over the phat xp received from his
      vassals. With a wistful sigh, he dreamt of being interviewed by the Cold
      Presence. For he knew the most important answer.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="green"><b>&quot;Who amongst you little beings is the most
      powerful?&quot;</b></font><br>
      <br>
      He would simply reply, &quot;I am. A formidable archmage, I wield magic in
      all forms at the highest levels of power. But most importantly...&quot; At
      this point he would slowly stride to a ledge, then turn around. &quot;I
      fear not death.&quot; With a small hop backward, he would plummet
      thousands of feet to his death. The Cold Presence would then <strike>snicker</strike>
      be taken aback in awe...<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Hey, are you going to join us in Incunabula Vault or what?&quot;
      Zaketh's voice interrupted LO's daydream.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Oh, um, yeah... on my way.&quot; Oaf then hurriedly portaled to the
      scenic (meaning usually deserted) town of Dryreach. With a quick buff or
      three, he hopped through the East Dires portal. Greeted by some very
      friendly gold wasps, he regretted the rather plodding pace at which he
      could run.<br>
      <br>
      After a few well-practiced RLASG maneuvers, he managed to disentangle
      himself from the swarms of swamp gromnies and mire wasps long enough to
      reach the entrance to the Incunabula Vault. Lumbering Oaf then began the
      intricate and rather lengthy process known to others as simply 'buffing'.
      Zaketh, Jin Lee, and Fyre-sun popped to the surface scant moments later,
      detecting his presence. Smiles, greetings, and snide comments about
      buffing followed.<br>
      <br>
      As he twirled around in portal space, he could already hear the screams of
      white dots being cruelly pierced by orange dots. Things would be different
      once he materialized. There would be another screaming white dot. In any
      case, the group of four descended upon the Olthoi like gnats on a bull.
      That is, they were mildly annoying. Nevertheless, with the help of a few
      other intrepid adventurers, the immediate area was soon cleared of the big
      fierce bugs with pointy things. They plunged deeper into the depths... at
      least four or five feet. Stiff resistance was encountered in the form of
      four more soldiers. These too were dispatched, after Zaketh had executed a
      rather skillful maneuver where he got two soldiers to gouge each other's
      eyes out. It was really rather amusing, especially when they threw cream
      pies at each other and started saying 'Nyuk, nyuk'.<br>
      <br>
      A lone soldier had apparently gotten one of his appendages stuck in the
      wall. Being of insectoid intelligence, it was running into the wall
      instead of away from it. As one can imagine, it wasn't having much success
      in extracting its arm. Zaketh, being the humanitarian (insectarian?) type,
      moved to put the Olthoi out of its misery. The three mages lazily watched
      as they chanted their sad song of Puish Zharil. The lighting must have
      been bad or something, because Zaketh's first mighty chop severed the
      Olthoi's stuck appendage instead of its head. He looked a little flustered
      when the Olthoi turned to focus its baleful, red-eyed glare at him. A
      scurrying sound quickly ensued, and a living wall of Olthoi swarmed out of
      the surrounding tunnels. No less than ten soldiers engulfed the hapless
      swordsman. Lumbering Oaf thought he heard a faint trickling sound, but he
      couldn't be sure.<br>
      <br>
      Jin Lee muttered to herself, &quot;Not good.&quot; Lumbering Oaf simply
      blinked in surprise, never having seen so many Olthoi at once. Fyre-sun,
      eminently practical, muttered a half-hearted &quot;Malar Zhapaj&quot; and
      motioned in Zaketh's direction. He didn't really expect it to hit a living
      target. By some miracle, Zaketh managed to squirm his way between two
      soldiers. Speeding past the three mages, he squeaked, &quot;Help.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Many close calls later, the four sat resting next to the exit portal,
      exhausted and heavy with phat lewt. Vitae had been rather scarce, with no
      deaths actually inside the dungeon. Zaketh had escaped a fierce Olthoi
      with the merest sliver of health by jumping through the exit, only to be
      burnt to a crisp by a drudge ravener when he reached the surface. Other
      than that, the night had been remarkably un-VR-like. Jin Lee and Fyre-sun
      left, carrying a lot more equipment and a lot less life than they had come
      in with. Lumbering Oaf, being the greedy type, and Zaketh, being the
      even-greedier type, decided to stay. And so the vitae did rise.<br>
      <br>
      Zaketh learned the joys of a shield buffed and polished with LO brand
      ShieldWax, the Impenetrability / Acid-Piercing Bane VI variety. As Oaf was
      rebuffing, Zaketh was casually tanking two soldiers. He declined the offer
      of aid, mentioning that the soldiers were nicking him for 0 and 1 points
      of damage, thanks to the shield. &quot;As long as I keep them in front of
      me, I'm fine,&quot; he remarked.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What happens when they get behind you?&quot; Oaf raised an eyebrow
      as a pink swirl formed behind the 3l33t tank. One snickering Olthoi later,
      Zaketh was lifted off the ground, experiencing a rather sharp, stabbing
      pain.<br>
      <br>
      Zaketh tells you, &quot;Oops.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      LO continued to rebuff, patiently waiting for Zaketh to return. After
      fighting a few Olthoi, he began to wonder why Zaketh wasn't back yet.
      Moments later, his ears turned red as Zaketh's voice came to him,
      muttering an impressive string of curses. He had died on the way there, in
      'a tough spot'.<br>
      <br>
      After retrieving Zak's corpse inside the dungeon, the duo set off into the
      heart of the Direlands swamps in search of Zak's other corpse. As they
      slowed to a stop, Oaf's face took on a puzzled look. &quot;Something must
      be wrong with my radar. It's all orange. Oh well.&quot; He shrugged.<br>
      <br>
      Zaketh blushed a little, then pointed to his corpse, several meters
      distant. Standing on top of it was a shadow lieutenant. And another. And
      another. And two panumbris shadows. Who were apparently conversing with
      four raveners and three stalkers. Who had brought along their pet gold
      wasps.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Dang.&quot; Oaf began his buffing process, starting with Zaketh,
      laying every available protection on the blademaster. LO quickly exhausted
      his available mana on buffing him. Oaf was in the process of regaining
      mana to buff himself when another hapless adventurer zipped through the
      veritable fog bank of orange dots. Zaketh, seeing his opening, sprinted to
      his corpse while a few of the monsters were distracted. Oaf frantically
      spat out healing spells with what mana he had left. Zaketh managed to grab
      everything and sprint away. Oaf, being a little slower, was targeted by a
      few shadow lieutenants and drudges when he saw two nice blue messages
      scroll by, kindly informing him that:<br>
      <br>
      <font color="blue">Armor Self VI has expired.</font><br>
      <font color="blue">The spell Impenetrability VI on Gelidite Robe has
      expired.</font><br>
      <br>
      A nice, spinning blue crystal filled his view shortly thereafter.
      Lumbering Oaf heard a Cold Presence laughing. He sighed. Out of the four
      deaths of the night, only one (Zak's) had actually been in the dungeon. He
      wished he was back with the Olthoi, safe inside Incunabula.<br>
