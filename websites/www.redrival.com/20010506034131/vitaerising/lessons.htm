      <font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Lessons Not Learned<br>
      </b></font><font face="Arial" size="3">by Zaketh<br>
      </font><font face="Arial">28 November 1999</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Well it was another day in which to
      adventure that Putty and me found ourselves near the Samsur triangle. We
      had gained much experience in our time away and I had completed my 19th
      circle of training and Putty his 18th. We thought it was high time to go
      back to the skel mines and r00l!!!!! Boy were we wrong.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After visiting the lifestone near the mine
      we headed out to its entrance. We decided not to slow ourselves and ran
      past many monsters to the area around the mine. It seemed not to have
      changed much since last our vitae flowed out of the place. For some reason
      I ignored the hackles rising on my neck and thus we pressed forward.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="mine1.jpg" width="185" height="100"></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">With our superior training the entrance was
      not that hard to breach. The skels did not stand a chance against us.
      Inside it was still dank and gloomy. Thus the adventure began on such a
      trivial note.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="mine4.jpg" width="507" height="302"></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After clearing the other areas of the mine
      we decided to revisit the areas of which Vitae Rising had fought and
      perished. Thus we fought valiantly teaching Skel Warriors and Skels to
      fear members of Vitae Rising, especially since we are better trained. We
      hacked our way through mountains of skels, skel warriors, and a Skel
      Captain. We were a pair of bladed death scything our way through the
      dungeon.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Thus we found ourselves at the locked door
      to the Skeleton lords antechamber. Having dispatched his minions with ease
      we felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. Denial..its such a beautiful
      thing. With putty pulling out some trusty lockpicks we preceded into the
      belly of the beast.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Like before it was a hard fought battle of
      us against skel warriors. While wounded we did dispatch these vile und00ds
      and their leader the captain. We were happy and oblivious to the cold hand
      of doom coming our way. We investigated the lich room and found them
      waiting. We then decided to check out the downstairs first. We were set
      upon at the first landing and vanquished the skel warriors with ease.
      Little did we know those were the Lords outer door guards.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Thus we entered another long hall with more
      skel warriors quickly dispatched. We looked forward and saw that the hall
      had another side around a corner. We approached this corner and were again
      set upon by a few skeleton warriors. When we heard…</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">“WHAT YOU LET THEM IN HERE!!!!</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">“YOU BUFFOONS, I WILL HANDLE THIS!!!!</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Well hearing that all of the sudden I had
      this quiver in my knees and a need to use the little adventurers room. I
      looked at Putty and it was like looking in a mirror. Alas that is all the
      time we had. THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP….then he was among us.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="mine2.jpg" width="635" height="386"></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">EEEEEEEKKKKKKKKK…it’s the skel Lord we
      yelled. We tried to fight this evil und00d with all our strength. He cast
      spells we stood…he hacked at putty we stood…he hacked at me we
      stood…he cast spells at putty we still held then he cut putty to pieces
      I ran like a schoolgirl.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">But the skel lord wanted two adventurers
      that day. Man I can run with the best of them. Thus I found convenient
      shelter from the Lords spells behind a much cracked and pitted wall. After
      resting I begin to poke away at the lord who was so enraged that he was
      not thinking of coming around the corner to turn me into pate. Thus I
      whittled away at him slowly. Putty had returned and retrieved his armor
      from his corpse and joined me in the whittling of the enraged skel lord.
      After much time and many unintelligible curses from the skel lord he
      succumbed to our blades. Thank goodness und00ds don’t have saliva
      glands. That lord was so pissed if he had saliva glands the wall would be
      thoroughly slimed with foam from his mouth.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Thus there was much rejoicing, healing,
      backslapping, healing, resting, healing, and did I mention healing. After
      our recuperation we preceded to get rid of the Lords staff of skel
      captains and skel warriors and loot his goodies chest. Upon exiting his
      inner sanctum the reserves showed up and again we fought and prevailed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There is a saying, “Pride Goes before a
      Fall”…no more apt words were spoken and typical of our confidence.
      After dispatching the reserves we decided to tackle the liches. Well seems
      skel lord upgraded his minions to guard the treasure room. There were now
      4 liches in all, 3 in the room and one in the hall. The hall guard must be
      the newbie lich. He fell to our blades too easy. Putty thus picked the
      worrisome lock that had given us earlier pause.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="mine3.jpg" width="446" height="408"></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">We proceeded to the end of the hall where a
      door separated us from 3 awfully ticked liches. Seems that was their
      little brother. When we got close they all started casting fearsome magic
      that weakened us and hurt in many ways. Sometimes we had to retreat down
      the hall to heal our wounds. Ever returning to the door to hurl taunts.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">“YOUR MOTHER WAS A DRUDGE!”</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">“DEATH HAS IMPROVED YOUR STENCH I
      SEE!!!!”</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">“HEY WAS THAT A SPELL OR BAD BREATH”</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Putty’s plan thus worked and we one by
      one drove the liches mad with rage to where they rushed the locked door to
      our awaiting blades. While it was not easy to dispatch them their rage was
      to our benefit. After the last fell I ran to a point I knew with which I
      could jump into the treasury. After healing from the fall we did proceed
      to get lots of Phat Lewt. Ahhh those were the days. We continued with the
      cleaning operation when we heard a faint scream. Hmmm we thought wonder
      what that was. Little did we know that it was not a hapless creature that
      wandered in but an enraged but controlled Lord being resurrected.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Thus while looting he set forth an
      insidious plan that upon hindsight at the end we were shivering in our
      boots at how easily we got out only beaten to a pulp.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">While we finished looting a small group of
      skel warriors did set upon us again. We fought them off yet again.
      However, we had over stayed our welcome and the younger lich did come back
      and set upon us in quick order. It was a valiant fight but his fearsome
      spell casting might took me to Mr. Lifestone. After assuring him I am not
      the type to be a repeat customer I ran back to the mine. On the way putty
      left alone took the lich out then fell to a skel captain blade while
      distracted.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Forsaking caution I did enter the mine
      alone and set to get my nice stuff back. After fighting my way through I
      saw my previous body. Ahh there you are….little did I know the Brothers
      lich had returned and they preceded to spell me to death while retrieving
      my items and before I could escape their wrath.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="mine5.jpg" width="252" height="320"></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">No, no, I really mean it I am not the type
      Mr. Lifestone. I won’t be back.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Again I made my way to the mine to be set
      upon again inside the dungeon. This time I was too weak from the last trip
      to Mr. LS I had to run outside yet again. Putty valiantly tried to come to
      my rescue again but was swarmed under by more skeletons. Which was shortly
      joined by me when a crack squad of skeleton archers did ambush me on exit
      of the fell mine.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">No…I really mean it…me and putty
      don’t lie like that. We really mean to not come back...it just happens.
      HEY! There is no need for insults…I am not a newbie that can’t run
      away…</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Thus we ran back and dispatched the archers
      and retrieved more of my goodies. It was fortune that I carried extra
      armor this day for both of us had lost much. Again we entered but with
      more of a slow purpose then a rush to get our things. Ah the bliss of
      ignorance. We again proceeded down to the dungeon killing along the way.
      Again we faced the liches to retrieve our things and again I was sent
      packing. Again putty joined me after reserves were set to bring him down.
      While returning, Mr. LS stopped talking to me now, Putty ran to join me at
      the entrance but was swarmed by a crack unit of the Lords minions. I
      entered the dungeon yet again and set upon going down to the lich lair.
      However, it was unnervingly easy. Too easy you could say. It was part of
      the plan. I again got to my body and was fixing to retrieve stuff when
      Putty called from another part of the mine for help. Knowing our luck I
      ran to help but was too late. The crack squad had struck again and
      disappeared.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">With this I set in for a wait waiting for
      putty to return before preceding. Again he did return and again the squad
      attacked…but I was waiting…unfortunately all I did was join putty in
      his express trip to the lifestone. After getting more armor for ourselves
      we set out again with notions of getting our stuff back. Ah…sentimental
      attachment to phat lewt can fog a tanks brain. Again we entered much
      battered and beaten and with much vitae did we proceed to enter again.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Again we were set upon but we prevailed and
      won our way to our bodies and did thus recover all our stuff without
      another visit to Mr. Lifestone. Man that lifestone has a foul mouth when
      he is mad.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">What is the moral of this story kiddies?
      Let und00ds keep their stinking treasure. You think we would have learned
      our lesson about the place but oh no you know tanks. Denial can be nasty
      in groups of more than one….=).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">p.s. I left with 8% vitae and Putty with
      17%</font></p>
