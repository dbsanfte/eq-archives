<p><font face="Arial">Well, this has been dragging on for a long time so I should go ahead and end it.  I will soon be leaving Asheron's Call.<br>
<br>
I started playing AC when the beta1 phase started, sometime in late June or early July 99 I think.  And while it didn't have the freedom of Ultima Online, it also didn't have all the restrictions of Everquest.  It was a happy medium for me.  I enjoyed the wide open world and the skill system, even though I wished there were more "trade" skills and player housing.<br>
<br>
One day while I was exploring a dungeon that was WAY too difficult for my low level blademaster I happened to run into an Azure Gromnie that was stuck.  I took the opportunity to play with AC's mobile camera and later that night did a short web page called
<a href="http://www.netputty.com/hearding/gromnie.htm"> Gromnie Taming</a>.  I still think it's amazing how this one piece set the tone of my writing for AC.  People loved it and told me I was a very funny guy.  This also still amazes me.  I don't consider myself funny at all.  I'd never written humor before.  Not in school, and not for
<a href="http://members.xoom.com/jehard2/UO/"> UO</a> or <a href="http://members.xoom.com/jehard2/EQ/"> EQ</a>.<br>
<br>
Just before I'd written the gromnie page I discovered<a href="http://mu.ranter.net/"> Musashi's
website</a>…through an Ultima Online friend of mine who goes by the nickname of
<a href="http://magnus.uong.com/"> Magnus (the original Semi-Roleplaying Tank
Mage)</a>.  What caught me up in Mu's site was the <a href="http://mu.ranter.net/asheron/acstories.html">chronicles</a>.  As luck would have it Mu started playing in the AC beta the same time I did and he already had a few stories up.  I loved every story Mu wrote.  I liked how they were illustrated with screenshots.  For UO and EQ I'd been very active in Usenet newsgroups and all of my stories were plain text without pictures.  Mu is a hundred times the writer that I'll ever be, but even though he writes about how much he sucks…I've got him beat there =P  I really and truly suck at computer games.  It's true.  It doesn't matter what game it is, I suck.  I rarely ever finish a single player game.  I only recently played an entire game of Alpha Centauri to it's completion (lowest difficulty level =P).  In UO I played for 11 months and never had any one of my 4 characters reach Grandmaster status in ANY skill.  I've played AC since release in November and just made 19th level.  If there is an opposite to a powergamer, I'm it.  But what helps me make up for that is that I have fun.  No matter what, I have fun, or I don't play.  Well, that and I can laugh at myself and how much I suck.<br>
<br>
So writing the gromnie page set the tone for my AC writing.  Ever piece I ended up writing poked fun at myself.  I also used a lot of light sarcasm and portrayed myself at times as almost the opposite of what my character actually is.  At this point I should say that I don't truly roleplay.  My Hearding character is ME.  He is me if I was put into the fantastic setting of the game.  But you won't catch me talking about football, or the stock market.  When I play, I'm there.  Real life talk is for
<a href="http://www.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?BoardID=110793&amp;Page=1"> message boards</a> and
<a href="mailto:jehard2@flash.net">e-mail</a>.<br>
<br>
Some time in Beta2, after Mu and the other people I knew had out-leveled me (not hard to do).  I got really, really bored with AC.  Kill, Loot,
Re-equip, Repeat.  I started not having fun.  Thinking back to what kept me interested in UO so long I realized that I needed a group to run around with.  In UO I was a member of a small guild called the
<a href="http://www.hakur.net/ros/"> Rangers of Spiritwood</a>.  We had a great time and I always loved playing with those guys.  So I put out a message on my web page saying that I was considering forming a group.  A few people responded and within a week we had the basis of Vitae Rising (The name itself is, of course, sarcasm - and I know that Vitae means life force…but most players will shorten "Vitae Penalty" to just "vitae" and that's why I chose the name).  On September 13th 99 we met for the first time.  Me, Arakasi (who subsequently returned to UO.  He's a kickin' artist.  Check out
<a href="http://www.outofcharacter.com/"> his UO cartoon site</a>.), his real life brother Tal'kah al-Quelz, and Bruised Lee met in Lytelthorpe and just ran around killing things.  It was great fun.  For the next few weeks we added new members at almost every gathering.<br>
<br>
Vitae Rising has been some of the most fun I've ever had.  Period.  Forming this group and watching it grow is a great feeling.  Vitae Rising, as a group, turned out exactly how I wanted it to.  Friendly, helpful, and funny as hell.  Vitae Rising is about inclusion.  If you're not a jerk we want you to join us.  It's about having cool people to hang out with.  And it's about doing really crazy, stupid, insanely dangerous things that you normally wouldn't do by yourselves.  I spent a lot of time trying to create events, or adventures that would include as many people, of widely different levels, of completely different skills sets, and temperaments (even d00ds are welcome, if they're not jerks =) as possible.  Nothing hurt me more than the time we portalled to a place and left someone behind.  I hope that VR continues doing business this way.<br>
<br>
Now to the future.<br>
<br>
Most of you know my wife's character's name is Dany.  I'll be closing my account (deleting the Hearding character in the process) and taking one of her character slots.  I don't expect to play, but if I get an urge to I'll have a slot open for a newbie character.  I've asked Zaketh to take over as webmaster for the VR pages.  He agreed even though he protested that he doesn't know anything about html.  Tough, neither did I =P.  I'll still be around, and we've got some professionals like Penelope and Katyara to help him out just like they helped me out.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Vitae Rising leadership.  This is very, very important.  Although we are a very chaotic, democratic group, I have always been the leader.  I have purposefully kept my hands off of most aspects of the group.  But it's important for there to be someone in charge.  Someone with final authority.  Someone who is respected and who puts the group above themselves.  I thought about this a long time and I'd like to nominate Lumbering Oaf to take my spot.  I haven't talked to him about it…hopefully he'll accept.<br>
<br>
As for me, well, I'll be watching the next batch of online rpgs very closely. <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/">  Anarchy
Online</a>, <a href="http://www.carnage.net/"> Shadowbane</a>, and <a href="http://www.worldfusion.com/news/news.html"> Atriarch
</a> all sound very interesting.  Farther out we have <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons/">Horizons</a>,
<a href="http://hjvault.ign.com/"> Hero's Journey</a>, and a slew of others.  After my experiences in EQ and AC I think I've come to the conclusion that a world needs to be PK to really appeal to me.  Those of you who know me know that I'm not a natural born killer.  I stink at PvP.  But it creates more emotional involvement in the game world.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can create a cross-game group like some of the<a href="http://www.lostorder.com/">
larger gaming guilds</a>.&nbsp; *shrugs*&nbsp; We'll see.<br>
<br>
Whatever game I end up in, I'd really like to have you VR guys there with me.  When Asheron no longer calls you look around and you'll find me somewhere, probably standing on top of a pile of corpses (my own) proclaiming my ignorance to the world.</font></p>
