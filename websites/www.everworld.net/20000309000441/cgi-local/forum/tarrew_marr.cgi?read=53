<P>We had our first event in Lavastorm yesterday. Here is how it went...

<P>First, we were being entertained by new-comers to the area that ran from fire elementals and trained them on others while in the pass. We have been enjoying watching people run from elementals (as well as our selves, occasionally, when we are low on mana).
<P>We decided it was time to have a quick event in Lavastorm. The bid of one platinum piece to see who could train the most elementals in a specific time frame to the pass (without magical help). The player must live and get all the elementals into the general pass area and then zone.
<P>Sinrae stepped forwards and proclaimed she held the title of six. We thought that was a bit low. We said as much and said it must be at least ten the next time. In private tells aside, we were laughing too hard to type complete words.
<P>Later, Sinrae came barreling over a hill followed by no fewer than... eleven elementals. The elementals flowed over the hill in a stampede. Unluckily for Sinrae, she had become slightly disoriented and was running the wrong direction.
<P>Watching her health, she was down to about two bubbles left, when she got her bearings and ran into the pass. She now holds the current record of eleven fire elementals in a train. She said she could get fifteen the next time if we hold the event again.
<P>Comments from people in the area ranged from:
<BR>"Holy sh#$!"
<BR>"What the hell was that?"
<BR>"Damn!"
<BR>"Was that on purpose?"
<P>Happy training!

<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=50 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; We had our first event in Lavastorm 
&gt; yesterday. Here is how it went...

&gt; We decided it was time to have a quick event

&gt; to see who could train the most elementals 
&gt; in a specific time frame to the pass 
&gt; (without magical help). The player must live 
&gt; and get all the elementals into the general 
&gt; pass area and then zone. 

&gt; Sinrae stepped forwards and proclaimed she 
&gt; held the title of six. We thought that was a 
&gt; bit low. We said as much and said it must be 
&gt; at least ten the next time. In private tells 
&gt; aside, we were laughing too hard to type 
&gt; complete words. 

&gt; Later, Sinrae came barreling over a hill

&gt; and ran into the pass. She now holds the 
&gt; current record of eleven fire elementals in 
&gt; a train. She said she could get fifteen the
