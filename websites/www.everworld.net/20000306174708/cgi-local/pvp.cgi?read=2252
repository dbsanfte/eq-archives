<P>yo guy, first of all, there is nothingwrong with newbies being on the pvp server, we wer all newbies at one point or another...tweakers do suck,but u dont see them on rallos zek for long....one min u see them in full bronze plate, the other they are naked and and have a newbie sword in their hand...

<P>understand this though...pkeing needs organization, and i think lots of people are against all-out-carnage...
<P>newbie killing is for pussies, and i'd just like to say thatits unfair...if u think its fair, then u should also have the balls to go attack someone who is like 10 levels higher then u and see what its like...as i said, its stuipid, and unchallanging....its like an adult fighting little kids...
<P>i think there is nothing wrong with u killing another player when they are low on health if that is the kind of char u play...to me a paladin waiting in hiding and then striking another player when they are at their weakest makes no sense, and leads to the stuipidity of Ultima Online...
<BR>if u are an evil rogue, or a dark shadow knight, then be free to kill someone when they are low on health, that is the kind of character u roleplay
<P>therefore, this is a roleplaying game, not a pk'ing field of slaughter, though it can be that too....so if u pk, do it within your character...if u have a grudge against someone, and it is within your roleplaying personality, go waste them...
<P>but if u are a good hearted cleric, and u see a druid with nifty stuff that u could use, it would be stuipid to pk him, unless he stood exactly against religious beliefs...
<P>u have to watch the line between roleplaying and sensless slaughter that can rui the spirit of the game...if u like pk'ing without a purpose like a little kid, go play ultima
<P>rallos zek is the best server to play on, since it offers more realism then any server, and gives u more roleplaying depth
<P>and for once, grow up and stop typing in caps...
