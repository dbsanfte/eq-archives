<P>

<BR>Hi, I play a Dwarven Cleric named Donqey. At first, I thought it would be cool to have the PvP switch, but then I thought about the abuse that it could do. People could go in teams of one person with one person that can PK, and like 3 or 4 others that cant. And while the PKer kills em, the others can Heal him. All in all I think its not a good RPing experience. So I decided to check out the all PvP server, and boy was I amazed. People were actually role playing all the time. We had some elves come into the Mountains near us, and they hailed us from far away, and we actually had Roleplaying going on! One person even had a hatred of elves for some reason, and the people around him had to restrain him. I have been attacked only twice by other people. Once by a guy the same level as me (which was 1 at the time) which resolved with us fighting it out one on one. Another time, I had accidently looted a corpse (I didnt know that I automatically picked up the money from the dead body) so I apoligized and gave it back to the guy, who was very greatfull. But while I was doing that, some newbie attacked me from behind. The next thing I know, about 3-5 of my fellow Dwarves rush to my aide and start smacking him down. It was a great learning experience for the kid and I have seen him running around and not killing anyone. I have found it to be an incredibly satisfying experience so far. Especially when compared to the other servers I was on at first. People actually help each other out here, because you never know when you might need that persons help when something is invading. All in all, I am glad they have an all PvP server, it makes everything more realistic.
