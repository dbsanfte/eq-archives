</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>I am too, a child of UO. But, on the opposite end. I began as a monster killer; and as my combat skill improved, I turned to the most challenging combatants: PKs. I died a lot at first :). But as my skills grew, I was able to hold my own and soon was going toe to toe with the the more infamous characters in Britainia. I loved every minute of it. One well known PK and myself went at it back and forth for a full hour one night and I had the time of my life. It was cool at first, (neither of us casting EVs, for example) both of us running on sheer skill.

<BR>To me, that's what PvP is all about. When the PK patch came about and the numbers of PKs dwindled I was saddened. My main enjoyment and eventually, my self appointed profession were quickly fading into the recesses of UO upgrades.
<BR>But these were aspects of PKs I did NOT miss:
<BR>1. The punks. Yes, I know, I know...your going to have them and they're all part of the game...but in no way does that mean I have to like it. They're propencity to win only by sheer numbers and picking on the lesser developed characters were the main reasons I became a PK hunter. It was not the fact that they merely killed only on those terms, but that they were forcing others to play their game. Sure, one may call it boring to only want to kill monsters, but, hey, it's their choice.
<BR>2. The thieves. Heh. Perhaps it's enough said, but it was getting a bit outrageous. It may have little to do with PKs, but it directly relates to the PvP switch.
<P>Of course, I can not speak from experience, but from the information I've been able to gather, the PvP switch seems to cover my gripes; and be able to pick up my long lost profession again. The PvP server would work in the same aspect.
<P>Just thought you might like to hear from a lesser known voice on the PvP issue: the PK-Hunter.
