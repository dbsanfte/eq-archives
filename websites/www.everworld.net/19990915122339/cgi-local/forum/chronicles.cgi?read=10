<P>Chapter I by Crimson

<BR>Glodain looked up at the stars above him. It was a cool, clear night. The campfire crackled nearby and the creatures of the night spoke to one another in the distance. It was almost a peaceful night. It would have been perfect, except for one minor nuisance.
<BR>“Bah! This is ground if too friggin’ hard! How do you elves sleep on it? It’s putting my ass to sleep! But not a wink for Pigorsh. Oh no! My ass might sleep, but there be no sleep for Pigorsh!”
<BR>Glodain looked over at his short companion. Bundled beneath several layers of blankets, cloaks and other clothes, he looked like a child with the flu. Well, he would have looked like a child, except for his large ugly nose sticking out from the cocoon of cloth. Glodain could not help but chuckle at how ridiculous his companion looked. “You’re a wizard, can’t you put yourself to sleep?”
<BR>“Oh, put myself to sleep, he says. Why didn’t I think of that? You’re such a friggin’ genius. Bah! Why do I put up with you? Just go away, and let me get some sleep.”
<BR>Glodain chuckled again. Despite the little creature’s mean demeanor, he liked the gnome. Why? Glodain had never been able to figure that one out in the more than two years he had spent with Pigorsh. It certainly was not for the conversation. Pigorsh rarely said anything that was not a complaint. However, Glodain suspected that Pigorsh had a heart of gold somewhere beneath all that clothing and hard, gnomish skin. But then again, Glodain had never been known as an excellent judge of character. That was why he no longer lived with his family in the Great Faydark. He was too ashamed to return after he had nearly killed them by bringing that human into their midst. The scar on his chest burned with fury at the thought of those dark memories.
<BR>Glodain’s reverie was broken by his companion’s loud and obnoxious snores. It looks like I have the first watch, Glodain thought to himself. He sat up and listened to the snoring of his companion. Pigorsh’s face looked almost peaceful in sleep, almost. Even in blissful sleep, the gnome wore a scowl on his face.
<BR>Having nothing better to do, Glodain removed his sword from his scabbard to inspect it. It was a fine blade of elven construction, thinner and lighter than one would believe possible. Satisfied that the edge of the blade was as a sharp as it would ever be, Glodain returned the blade to its home.
<BR>It was then that Glodain heard twigs breaking in the distance. And something else. It sounded almost like… sobbing? Curious, Glodain cast one glance toward Pigorsh before silently leaving his comrade. The gnome was even less amiable than usual when his sleep was cut short.
<BR>Glodain walked for less than a minute before he found the disturbance. In a small clearing, a figure kneeled upon the earth. Her face was in her hands and her body shook with each sob. Glodain could see her pointed ears in the light of the moon. Why would a maiden be travelling alone in these woods? Granted, the woods were now safer than they once had been, but not safe enough for a young female to venture accompanied in.
<BR>After watching her for several minutes, Glodain realized that her crying would not cease anytime soon. Stepping into the clearing, he spoke softly, “Who are you, young one? And why are in these woods alone?”
<BR>The elven maiden jumped to feet with a small dagger in hand. If her life had been happier, she would be regarded as quite striking. As it was, her eyes were red and puffy from the many tears she had shed. Her face was streaked and her nose was redder than it should be. She sniffled before replying. “And who might you be?” she questioned, with a hint of fear in her voice.
<BR>Glodain raised his hands to show that he had no hostile intentions. “My name is Glodain, maiden. I mean you no harm and none shall come to you.” This last line did not seem to convince her since she still pointed her dagger at him. Glodain sighed and repeated his first question. “I repeat, who are you, young one and why are you alone?”
<BR>“My name is… E’gaile,” she replied after a short pause. “I… I… I wasn’t alone,” she stammered. “I was with my… my…” she managed before she broke into tears again.
<BR>Glodain watched E’gaile for a short time before advancing again. Careful to keep his hands raised, he took slow and deliberate steps. When he got within three feet of her the dagger flashed into the air between them. “Stay back,” E’gaile warned, “I know how to use this.” However, her voice betrayed her lack of confidence.
<BR>“Trust me, my dear, I mean no harm.” Thinking quickly, he added, “Though I do not doubt your claim.” Glodain paused and took a deep breath. “But you should not be in the woods alone. Come with me back to my camp. My friend and I will bring you to closest settlement where you can find some help.”
<BR>E’gaile stared long and hard at Glodain. Her eyes jumped quickly from his face to his sword and back again. The memory of her fiancé’s killers still burned freshly in her mind. Even though she did not recognize his face, he carried himself like one of them. After nearly five minutes of deathly silence, she lowered her dagger. “Very well.”
<BR>Glodain gave a reassuring smile and led her back to camp. Upon stepping into the clearing, he was greeted by the grating voice of his companion.
<BR>“What were you trying to do? Kill me? Leaving me alone while I slept! You’re lucky I’m still alive! Not an ounce of friggin’ sense in your whole body! Damn good thing that I’m a light sleeper.” Pigorsh stopped as he spotted the figure behind Glodain. “And what’s this? Not only do you leave me undefended, but you leave mean for a woman!” Pigorsh paused this consider this last thought. “Well… I suppose that’s a good reason,” he muttered. “But you still shouldn’t have left me alone! Damn, elf, why do I put up with you?” he added at a louder volume.
<BR>Unfazed by his friend’s verbal onslaught, Glodain replied while gesturing toward E’gaile. “Pigorsh, allow me to introduce E’gaile. E’gaile, this is my good friend, Pigorsh. Careful, he’s been known to bite.”
<BR>“Ack! Bite! What kind of friggin’ lie is that? Now you’re gonna scare the girl.”
<BR>E’gaile stood outside the clearing watching the little drama unfold in front of her. She had never met a gnome before and was beginning to wish she never had. Not only did he have a foul mouth; he was a disgusting looking individual as well. Not to mention that a foul stench emanated from him. In all honesty, she was not sure that Pigorsh was the source of this aroma, but he was upwind from her. Her thoughts were interrupted when Glodain turned and spoke to her.
<BR>“Would you like something to eat?”
<BR>E’gaile nodded weakly. She was very hungry and she was afraid to use his powers since Dain’s death. E’gaile allowed Glodain to lead her to a bedroll next to the fire. He gave her some rations and then sat next to Pigorsh.
<BR>“Where did you find the girl? And why the hell did you bring her back?” Pigorsh whispered to his companion.
<BR>“Alone in a clearing not far from here. She was crying and defenseless. From what I can see, she only has a dagger and she doesn’t know how to use it.”
<BR>Pigorsh nodded. Still, it was unusual for Glodain to show himself to a fellow elf. Usually he would force Pigorsh to help while Glodain watched at a safe distance. “So why didn’t you get me?”
<BR>After waiting over a minute for a response, Pigorsh turned to see what had caught Glodain’s tongue. He thought he saw a tear running down the elf’s cheek, but assumed it was just shadows playing tricks on him. For the two and a half years that he had known the elven warrior, Pigorsh had never seen him cry. “Well? What is it?”
<BR>Glodain closed his eyes and breathed deeply. “I… I thought she was my sister,” he stammered.
<BR>Pigorsh jumped to his feet and yelled, “You have a friggin’ family?! What the hell are you doing with me then?! In the name of all that is good and holy, why aren’t you with them?!”
<BR>This outburst caused E’gaile to jump. She had not been listening to their conversation and, in fact, her attention had been solely consumed by her food. Now that she had been brought back to the world of the living, she looked around. That was when she saw a piggish snout and a pair of beady yellow eyes behind the gnome and elf. Following her first instinct, she screamed. That was when things started to get interesting.
