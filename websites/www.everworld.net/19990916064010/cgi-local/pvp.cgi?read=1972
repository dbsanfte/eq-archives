<P>

<BR>&gt; The other day I was Afk for a matter of minutes outside of
<BR>&gt; Befallen and of course was immediately attacked. You see, when
<BR>&gt; these scumbags realized we were afk and not fighting back, they
<BR>&gt; decided to attack. Of course, this is one of the most cowardly
<BR>&gt; things I have ever seen. Well, my roommate happens to gate me
<BR>&gt; out in time but I still die becuase one of them used a DOT spell
<BR>&gt; on me and I lost a half of a bubble of experience. We all know
<BR>&gt; that DOT's in PvP are illegal now. Well this was the last straw
<BR>&gt; for em and many of my friends.
<P>Well now don't you think perhaps you were a bit foolish to go AFK on a PvP server in the middle of a busy dungeon area.? It takes all of 30 seconds to log out of EQ. Anyone with the least bit of common sense knows this is a good idea, and those lacking this sense soon come to the same conclusion by trial and error.
<P>&gt; We have left the PvP server and are not sure if we will ever
<BR>&gt; come back. I hate to say that I am giving these jerks such power
<BR>&gt; over me but hey, screw 'em. I have come across too many people
<BR>&gt; that will steal or murder you when they have an advantage and
<BR>&gt; will not accept your duel or will not fight you when its an even
<BR>&gt; fight. Or even better, they gang up on you 3 on 1 but when you
<BR>&gt; do it to them they complain. Well, I say screw the PvP server
<BR>&gt; and all of the jerks that are on it. This is not a blanket
<BR>&gt; insult, there are many of you on this server that are true role
<BR>&gt; players and this statement is not being said towards you. All
<BR>&gt; the good people on this server know who they are and all the
<BR>&gt; assholes know that they are warped minded individuals. And if
<BR>&gt; you dont know, then when someone calls you one, they are
<BR>&gt; probably right.
<P>What does the odds of the battle or your death have to do with "roleplaying"? Absolutely nothing. This server is about PvP. It is fun for both role-players and power gamers. My Halfling Druid plays in the Misty Thicket area most of the time, and I have little or no trouble ever in that area with my own race and other good races. As I grow stronger and venture out into the world more often, I am boud to encounter more hostile races and players, and possibly a few bad seeds from among the "good" races. This is to be expected, and is why I and those like me play on this server in the first place.
<P>Your post sounds like nothing more than a player who is pissed off at having made a mistake and subsequently died and paid the price for that mistake. You knew that you would be attacked from the beginning on Rallos Zek. You knew your character was vulnerable when you left it unattended. It's unfortuante that a DOT spell led to your death and you lost extra XP because of it. That's a problem I'm sure Verant will address in the near future. In the meantime the rest of us will continue to enjoy the server, and if you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen.
