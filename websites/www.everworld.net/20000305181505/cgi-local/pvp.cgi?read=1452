<P>> You countered my points execellently!

<BR>You did same.. I had to think deeper when I had to respond to your counters.. Nice job :)
<P>&gt; HOWEVER, your first posts did NOT say what they said in response
<BR>&gt; to my post. But I must back down. I agree with your desire for
<BR>&gt; freedom (thus I'm on PvP) and (if what you say is true) never
<BR>&gt; messing with someone below you. I'm assuming all you said was
<BR>&gt; true, and on that point I found no choice but to agree.
<P>&gt; But PLEASE help us save PvP in online RPGames. I don't want to
<BR>&gt; lose this freedom, same as you. I'm just asking you not to go
<BR>&gt; nuts. I'd be very willing to team up at some point and see if
<BR>&gt; your words back up your actions.
<P>One is roleplaying a murderer... his prime goal is to make sure he kills. I can back this up with limitless roleplaying fictional examples, so no point saying this isn't right roleplaying. Problem now is... I see a guy hes hurt... hes stronger than me..he has nice loot and I hate him because he looted my friend who died 4 days ago. (example)..
<P>Nobody will miss this opportunity... because hes stronger than you, and now is only time you can exact vengance. This means, you got to do the first strike.. Now what... Do you want me to roleplay? that is .. start talking to him my reasons... why i want to kill someone and such... there is no time, if i do that it will be too late.. so there is not much choice here.. what i'd hate to see is GM come and start whipping me how I didn't roleplay.
<P>Another scenario... Your enemy, person you hate (reasons are limitless, no point going into this either..) but I am sure there will be some players that ticked you off and such... may it even be me lol .. anyway, you don't have time to start talking about some roleplaying excuses there, point is you need to beat him up because words will do no good. If you talk, your element of suprise is gone..
<P>&gt; My problem is YOUR posts change in every response. If you do
<BR>&gt; what you say in response to MY post, you are doing what is
<BR>&gt; right.
<P>No, I am not anti roleplaying , but I just dont want GM's enforcing us to roleplay. I will roleplay when I can, but not always, not non stop. Majority of my attacks will be without words... And as for reasons I always do have some majority are from previous disputes... To Many it will seem like random pk action (which is another point I think should be SUPPORTED)..I dont have time explaining to someone , some bystander reasons of my vendetta whatever it may be. That is why I ignore explaining my actions, but person who I attack will surely know.. Now this is great, too bad if you dont know what the hell is going on, but who cares to you I am already a random pk who doesnt care who or what he kills..
<P>&gt; Again I say, I WILL be PvP, let's just see how it all weeds out.
<BR>&gt; Help me/us make sure it follows it's proper ROLE! Even if we
<BR>&gt; never say a WORD before our enemy is dispatched....
<P>Yep good hehe I just talked about that didn't see you supported my idea of "speechless" killing...
<BR>As for you if you want to understand my reasons for attacking people, you'd have to be with me non stop from day one, to see whoever steals a coin, whoever drives a train onto me.. because I dont forget these people and I eventually get them sometime... but to you who doesn't know what crime occured, I dont have time to say "you are the guy who trained me before" and then the guy can pretend he doesn't know what im talking about, whereby you would side by him, and i'd be forced to eliminate you both. Now he and I get fun out of it, but you don't. Thats why I dont see a problem with "random playerkilling". I can support it with reasons and roleplaying , its just that I hate how GM's frown upon that. Its an aspect which I love. I dont want to play a game where everybody is friendly towards me... No point it woudl get boring, because then its just mere constant leveling, exploring and quests.. I like that PVP factor of everquest's PVP server. And that what you are saying how you will check if I am goign to be what I said I will be, hell I can introduce another aspect of myself.. Multiple personality disorder... :) Perfect for such player like myself eh?
<P>&gt; Thanks.
<BR>Thanks for good reply earlier, you are actually someone who took time to read my heated comments (which I do on purpose, of course I am not at all so upset about it, but I just dont like how Geiger is starting to impose his ideas on roleplaying as right ones.)
