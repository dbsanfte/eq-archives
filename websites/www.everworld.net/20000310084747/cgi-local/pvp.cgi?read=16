<P>Hello All,

<P>Im message board admin. Ragnar from Eqboard.com stoping by to pay my respects to this fine site, and share my thoughts on Pvp.
<P>Ok let me first start off with Uo and my experiances. When I first got on Uo back in the good 'ole days of dread lords, There was a sense of danger every time you set foot outside of town, you didnt just have monsters to deal with you had other players who wanted your head. I can remember looking up to some of the pks like gods, there were so powerful and I was a newbie, well I was lucky enough that a few took me under there wing, and really helped me build up. When I was good enough to hold my own in combat I became a Dread lord and started to Pk. Some of the best memories I have are having battles against other players, I wasnt a jerk about pking, I didnt kill newbies, but I had a few mortal enimies that I would duel to the death every time I met up with them. I had so much fun pking in Uo, well OSI came out with a patch to put a penalty on pks; every time they died they would loose stats, I found this to be quite annoying and soon after left Britannia.
<P>Eq looks to be doing a pretty good job on Pvp, and I cant wait to get in the lands of Norrath and test it out, on Feb 10th I will have that chance =), I know some people think that PvP isnt roleplaying, but what better way is there to strike fear into the hearts of others than to prove your worth in combat?. Another reason I am all for Pvp is what better AI is there than real people?? real people sont get stuck like mosters do, and you can never predict how another player will react, and monsters dont care who you are, real people will remeber you and want there revenge. It adds a lot of depth to the game.
<P>Just my 2 cents,
<P>-Rag
