<P>First let me apologize for the message I posted regarding my name. If I offended anyone I am very sorry. I suppose that in the struggle for EverQuest to establish itself a chokehold of conformity has threaded its way into Norrath. 'Tis a shame but inevitable I suppose. I have a strict moral code in real life as well as in my fantasy role playing. That is my point. This is my fantasy...I am the one paying the bills to play this game. I feel that freedom of expression comes in all forms. I have seen many names in our wonderful game. Everyone accepts those fit into their idea of what EQ should be. Even as you scroll down the message board you can see the obvious variety. Each name is someone fulfilling their fantasy, regardless of how ridiculous it appears to the next player. The only reason I chose my name again was so that when players who knew me knew they were protected to the best of my abilities, as long as they hadn't brought rath through dishonorable actions. I would gladly lay down my life for anyone whose path I crossed, irregardless of their names, or their deity, or their race.

<BR>However this is all a moot point because I am bowing to the conformity and changing a name that has been mine for a decade. Truly this is a sad passage for me. The moral code of ethics I am so proud to have nutured over many, many years tells me I should not back down, that I should stand for what I know is right. Instead, for the honor of my guild and everyone's peace of mind I am willingly changing my name. It has been painful to be taunted when I never meant harm. With a heavy heart I resign my name. Perhaps now I can get back to doing what I do best-beating the crap out of bad things. If you meet me on the path do not hesitate to ask for anything you might need, I will cheerfully do my best to help. But please, I beg you, do not insult my honor, because I would never insult yours. Thank you for listening, safe hunting and may the Light of Marr shine on you all.
