<P>A Solution!! ... please read and comment (long)
<P>Posted by Grog on February 27, 1999 at 08:06:37:
<P>(dial-218-tnt-btvt-02.ramp.together.net - 209.91.2.218)
<P>I was looking forward to playing on the PvP server. That is an understatement...I was
<BR>Psyched! Not because I enjoy arbitrarily attacking anything that moves, but because I believed that if it was done correctly it could actually result in MORE role play than would be found on the PvE severs. How's this , you ask? Call me crazy do you? Well, bare with me for just a minute more.
<BR>Currently, PvP follows the four level system; you can not attack any player who is not
<BR>within four levels higher or lower of your character. I see this as a very bad move and one that will take away allot of role play potential. This system does not stay true to the world you inhabit....it doesn't make sense and is impossible to role play. As such, instead of adding to the effect of total emersion into the world of Norrath, it does the opposite...it forces you out of Norrath. Let me explain:
<BR>You are an 8th level Ogre Warrior and are wandering about in the wilderness when you
<BR>stumble upon two 2nd level Halfling Rogues. Lucky You! "yum....little halflings make Grog
<BR>full...me like eat little halflings!" And with that you lay into them with fervor, practically tasting them already! That makes sense! But sadly things don't quite go that way. Instead, the Halflings give you a glance as they stroll by, having already assessed that you cannot attack them, and talk as they pass " Oh ! Something smells awful..whew!.....Oh..Grog! I didn't see you there! Fine day isn't it old chap?" . With that, they take their leave and you can hear the echoes of their laughter down the path as you curse the fact that one of them wasn't just a couple levels higher!
<BR>Or perhaps you were traveling with an Ogre friend of yours who is 4th level, and you come across those same two halflings. A battle ensues and you must stand by helpless to do anything while one Rogue moves around to your friends rear, and back stabs him to death!
<BR>Would any of that make sense to your character? Does that make sense to you? When
<BR>something in a game is so blatantly out of context, is upsets the game experience . All of the sudden your cursing level restriction rules instead of launching into battle to save your friend, as you KNOW your character would do in such a situation! Continuity is broken.
<BR>I was excited about one prospect of PvP in particular, and I saw an opportunity that I
<BR>craved for; Large battles! Yes, I could picture it , a 100 Orgres , Trolls, and Dark Elves atop
<BR>one hill ; Rumbling and laughing in anticipation of battle, while ranks of Dwarves , Humans ,
<BR>and Elves (or what have you) stood stoically on another ; quiet in their intense resolve.
<BR>Suddenly , the forces of Evil fall silent at the sweeping gesture of the Dark Elf Commander, and
<BR>with another wave of his arm the charge is sounded! Ogres , Trolls, and Dark Elves spill down into the valley with all their fury! Archers raise their bows and the unmistakable sites and
<BR>sounds of spells being evoked, can be seen and heard from the rear lines of both sides. The
<BR>Archers prepare to launch their hail of death on the approaching hordes.....but no! They have to
<BR>search among the on coming enemy for someone within their 4 level allowance! The Warriors
<BR>are walking around each other on the battlefield searching for someone to fight, and it looks
<BR>more like a junior high school dance where you have to find your partner who has the same
<BR>number pinned to their clothes as you .
<BR>Your team of Rangers, who were smart and stealthy enough to sneak around the back of
<BR>enemy lines, were going to take out the spell casters from the rear, but are now dumbstruck as
<BR>for what to do, because they killed the two spell casters their level limits would allow, and they
<BR>can't touch the ten others!
<BR>Does any of this make sense in Norrath? Does this make sense to you? Gone is the heart
<BR>pounding fluid nature of battle, where spells or arrows could come flying out of nowhere any
<BR>moment. Gone is the tactics of isolating bands of enemies behind your lines and decimating them
<BR>with shear numbers! And most importantly , gone is all the role play that would come with a
<BR>building of hostilities culminating in the call for war!
<P>So I have a complaint, and maybe valid ones at that, but do I have a solution, you ask?
<BR>Well, I believe I might. Simply do away with the level limits and use the faction system . The
<BR>fact is , it makes sense , if a Wood Elf and a Dark Elf meet in the woods, a battle would ensue
<BR>regardless of level. It makes sense because these two races do not like each other. The faction
<BR>system makes sense; if a level 10 Elf was running around killing level 1 Elves who are favorable to the current faction standings he has, his faction status changes. A couple newbie kills later, and he can't enter the towns any more for the guards will attack. He has basically cut himself off; he can't go to "good" cities, for his status there is ruined, and he can't goto "evil" cities because his faction status hasn't changed enough to be welcome there either. Simply put; he's screwed. However, he can kill all the level 1 Ogres he can find, and that will be acceptable. It makes sense.
<BR>Norrath is a dangerous world and if you are playing PvP, then all the more so. If a band of Ogres is camping on the outskirts of a city, and ambushing unlucky travelers who stumble upon them, then a posse needs to be quickly organized in said city , to go out and destroy the threat to it's citizens! This makes sense, and level restrictions will ruin it. By using the factional system, you open up a wide range of possibilities that would otherwise be shut off, and you still take care of many potential problems that can come with PvP games. Someone in town makes you angry and you want to attack them? Well, such an action has it's consequences with not only the town guards, but with your factional standing as well. If they accept a challenge for a duel, then all is fine with your factional standings, but if not, then their is a price you pay. This is how it should be, a decision you can make, but one that could possibly change your life! That Makes Sense!
<P>"A group of 5 impossing ShadowKnights of incredibly high level slam into the Elven flank,
<BR>sending Rangers and Rogues alike flying in all directions .... your line is breached! The Elven
<BR>commander atop his hill sees this and imediately orders his elite guard to abandon him and
<BR>stope the Shadow Knights advance befor all is lost!"
<P>Sorry, this cannot happen... the Shadow Knights couldn't fight low level opponents and the Elite
<BR>Guard of the Elven commander quickly lets their leige know that only one of them is in the
<BR>corect level zone that would allow them to attack. Gone are all these possibilities , and how many of you can honestly say that such a huge battle doesn't appeal to you? Gone is the option to explore your tactics, setting up battle lines and specialized squads. Gone is the role of
<BR>commander, for he cannot possible keep track of who is what level.
<P>The solution is simple and it works ; do away with level restrictions and use the faction
<BR>system that is already in place.
