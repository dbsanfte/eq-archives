<P>WHAT IS UP WITH THE GUIDES!!! ok sorry about the caps but I am really pissed.. First off they Take 2 hours to get to your petition if at all. The other night I got killed by a town guard in a town my faction is really good in.. This happened right after I died from a train of Minos I was bound in the bank.. I thought I was going to get killed over and over.. but I came back and the SAME Guard liked me again.. I say must be a bug.. Petition a gm and wait for a responce... 2 hours later I talk to on..he says hold on a sec I got to check on something.. Wait ANOTHER HALF HOUR.. HE LOGS OFF THE SERVER LEAVING ME WAITING.. So I petition AGAIN and wait another HOUR.. talk to another guide. He told me there is nothing he can do and that faction is "Random".. I not wanting to have any of this ask to speak to the head GM that was on.. By the way a nice Mino Hero decids to beat me down while talking to him.. So I wait another HOUR to get to the next guy.. HE TELLS ME THE SAME THING.. So I get mad and quit for the night. NEXT day I see Trok is on so I tell him.. he tell me to petition (me being very scard of the mighty petitions that never get accepted) do it hesantly and I wait for an hour waiting for him.. BUT when I do get him and talk to him he says. THAT IT IS A BUG AND IS WELL KNOWN!!!!! So I got my exp back after I died again to that bug. ( just in another city as I traveled home) This leads me to believe that the GM's DO NOT know what they are doing and I am VERY ANGERY ABOUT THE HOW THEY HANDLE PETITIONS!!!!!

<P>come back next post and read THE EVIL GM GODZ!!!!
