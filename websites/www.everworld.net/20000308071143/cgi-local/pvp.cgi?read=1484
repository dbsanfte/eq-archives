<P>Look, I didnt' play on the PVP server in beta, so everything I say has to be taken with a grain of salt.... One of the complaints that I heard several times was that so many players would pop in on the PVP server, and be out in a couple of days. From what I heard, the membership was very fluid. I have few doubts that this was exactly because of people like Tarquin - so many of us are weary refugees from the dismal lands of UO, and have no interest in getting involved with that kind of atmosphere again. In case you didn't know, 989 has made one point very clear - this is intended to be a _roleplaying_ game. Now I agree, as an ideal, having everyone be PVP makes a lot of role playing sense. But in reality, I suspect that too many people will either be a d3wd, or "roleplaying" a sociopath serial murder. I mean, come on. By the way folks, the thing that stands the best chance of destroying the PVP server is not that a bunch of GM's will be wandering around "enforcing role-playing". It's that the power gamers will chase every one else off of the server, and that 989 will then decide that it makes no economic sense to keep the server running. If you played beta 4, all you had to do was to log on to see that the PVP server was much less popular than the others.

<BR>Will it be like that after release? I sincerely hope not. In fact, I think it would be nice to have a couple of PVP servers - one for the role-players, and another one for the powergamers to go to, so they can just leave the rest of us alone. Maybe they could name it something like MadKIllahGetTheMoFo'n'BeatTheyA**.....
