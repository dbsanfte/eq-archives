</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> Everquest is built on roleplaying. Those of us who want PvP

<BR>&gt; added in with our roleplaying want the PvP server. My idea of
<BR>&gt; PvP in EQ and your idea of PvP seem to differ. I can be a
<BR>&gt; ruthless killer of my enemies very easily, however I'd much
<BR>&gt; rather do it in role and for a reason other than.. "Golly I
<BR>&gt; wanted his helm". People are making others their pawn by
<BR>&gt; senslessly enforcing their powers of PvP on them when it doesn't
<BR>&gt; fit the situation and doesn't fit the game. If you want to go
<BR>&gt; and just kill people for fun and OWN them then go play Quake.
<P>Own people? what are you talking about.. no it not right, I do use roleplay, I just dont like being forced to do it everytime. People should be allowed to remain quiet when they kill, or kill someone when they are weak,.. that is all roleplaying of an evil character... also many are against own racial killing, but this is whats so good about pvp server as it gives you ability to challenge everyone. (I am not saying I'm abusing this and killing newbies, no fun in that).. nor am I imposing my rule, I m just saying let people talk normal language, no need to use some special roleplaying fiction... and don't close server down if people play it..look if we play it, then we play it becase we like it.. if i get pissed at game and i dont find it fun i wouldn't play it...people that play on pvp have additional dimension added to game which is great..more realistic enivornment, more fun..more risk... more player interaction.. thats why I love pvp server, and I'd hate to see it go down just because you think its not a success. After all if you have players playing there and enjoying , let them :)
<P>&gt; Everquest is about high fantasy role playing, not high fantasy
<BR>&gt; fragging. That singular attitude and anit Role playing thought
<BR>&gt; will drive the majority of good role players away from the PvP
<BR>&gt; server and keep other from coming. There are plenty of other
<BR>&gt; games that cater to mindless killing. I'll reinforce what my
<BR>&gt; views are, Just because we have the ability to kill doesn't mean
<BR>&gt; we have to. I'm not even going to bother wasting my time citing
<BR>&gt; all of the opportunities to PvP and in role, where you can
<BR>&gt; actually be playing part in a certain historical event. "I
<BR>&gt; struck down 10 Dark Elves in the battle of the Blood
<BR>&gt; Moon"... I fell Rallos Zek's Begotten Son.. We have the
<BR>&gt; opportunity to be who ever we want to be.
<P>This is hard for some people, say I am mentally challenged, or lazy or I can't type well..why would I spend my time typing this? I mean I do ask people to drop their gold and I will spare their life... and yea roleplaying is fun, but I dont want to see it being forced onto people.. like I just walk up to a guy and do kill him, maybe because of some past dispute, maybe just cause I felt I should be playerkilling and continuing my roleplay of a murderer/outcast/mad player... I dont want to see him call a GM and now I am one thats being "brainwashed" and attacked by some GM's how I am not playing how I should..
<P>I can play the PK
<BR>&gt; thing as well as anyone. It holds absolutely no excitement for
<BR>&gt; me. If I want to "OWN" someone I'll go play Quake, if
<BR>&gt; I want to play Everquest, expect to see me playing in Role,
<BR>&gt; thats where the true fun of being creative and playing in role
<BR>&gt; comes. PvP is just a Cherry on the sundae.
<P>I know, and I DO like to roleplay, just don't force people to it it will fit itself. PVP server is great it lets people have ABILITY to fight anyone they want, and yes its fun to roleplay, but sometime in heated battle i have no time to write, which I am very certain you experienced...
<P>Geiger, that story you wrote about husband and his wife... so what about them? thats good, I like being haunted..and you never know maybe he was roleplaying to a great extreme :P I dont oppose you , I just am defending the existance of PVP server, and I am trying to hold GM's from introducing their dictatorship to such an extreme. Players are capable and do in end balance everything out... maybe more roleplaying could be added, but dont punish peopel for not roleplaying...
<P>p.s register your sony IP so it looks green.
