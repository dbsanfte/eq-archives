</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>If you were in UO then you know that was not the way hobbes or myself played, yes I killed people without remorse, anyone I saw as a matter of fact. But hardly ever did I have a group of pk's with me killing everyone so that it was an unbeatable army of pkillers. 99.9% of the time it was just hobbes and myself doing the pkilling. We would take on entire armies by ourselves. One event sticks out in particular in my mind. The GM's in UO were staging an event where Trolls and Orcs were attacking the orc fort. Upon notification of this event Hobbes and myself headed to the area to do a little rampant pkilling. When we arrived there we killed 5 or so people and then people started getting mad. 20-30 people surrounded me and were threatening to attack me, hobbes was standing back observing the situation un-seen by everyone else, they were too busy threataning me to notice. Everyone attacked and my first move was to teleport out of the circle to the outer edge. Hobbes and myself began launching a barage of spells, we took out atleast 15-20 people before everyone stopped trying to attack us and the only thing that we said to the people who were still alive was "Next." We proceeded to loot every corpse that we had created and also took the boat that was the prize for the event.. We left the event with un-countable ammounts of armor and weapons as well as a boat... To me this is the epidemy of role playing an evil god. We did not kill everyone at the event, though we could have easily... we just killed who was attacking and threatening us and then made our leave. That is how me made our names known... not by killing everyone we saw but by killing large armies who thought to challenge us, and leaving bystandards to tell the story. We never had any advantage over anyone, we didnt cheat, we werent suped up by the GM's, we were just good players... And from the way the EQ pvp server looks to be heading this entire persona of player is going to be eliminated. I hate the fact that this is happening and hope to god that they change it.

<P>&gt; AI doesn't compare... but I equate "rampant pkilling"
<BR>&gt; with the description of a half dozen PK's "nuking"
<BR>&gt; someone without half a chance to survive in 1.5 seconds whereas
<BR>&gt; PvP is a life or death confrontation where human wit has a
<BR>&gt; chance to come into play. Yes you want to use every advantage at
<BR>&gt; your disposal in PvP, but rampant pkilling to me is represented
<BR>&gt; by the hordes of people who only fight vs. opponents or in
<BR>&gt; situations where they cannot lose. Why risk fighting if there's
<BR>&gt; a risk of losing? I say why fight if there isn't.
<P>&gt; don't forget the pretty scenery, you can almost smell them roses
