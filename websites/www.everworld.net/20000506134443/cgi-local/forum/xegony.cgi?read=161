<P>After haning around in Qeynos area for quite some time i have learned 3 things.

<BR>1. People have too much time on their hands. -what do i mean by this? well lets see. i am lvl 20 right now. a bit lower than my mates but thas because i work for aliving. I am sick of seeing high ass ppl hanging around low lvl places acting like god. THIS IS NOT CHURCH WHY MUST I WORSHIP YOU!
<BR>2. Race and CLass wars are pointless. -WTF cares which race is better? and who cares which is funnest to play? do you people have and IQ of 3? do you need mommy to see if the content in the game is right for you? Just read the stats of the classes and races and choose then shut the F%&* up. And all you druids out there. So what if you're class is the best, Just because you become gods later on does not mean you have to argue about how you could defeat any one solo. chances are you choose to play a non pvp site so shut the f&%$ up. for those who do play on a pvp site (i did but i met some really annoying people..sorta like being in prison)i respect you..expecially those who gang up and wait right out side of sure fall and slaughter the newbie as he exits the cave.
<BR>3. SOW should be bottled and sold for 500pp. -Why the F&@$ do so many people find that playing a game with out sow is too slow? i mean group with a shaman and then ask don't fricken ooc or shout s^%* like that it bugs the hell out of people. Go get you self some journey men boots and shut the F^$@ up...
<P>The point of this was to really wast your time, and make people mad. because witout hate there would be an up set in the galaxy and we'd all be sucked in to the sun...and their would be no EQ...NOOOOOO.
<P>-Joe Punk ROck, saying F&^% off and C-ya in the pit..NOFX better tour soon or i'm goina go back to the pvp and start killing people.
