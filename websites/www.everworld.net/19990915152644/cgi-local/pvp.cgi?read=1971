<P>Well, I can say this with certainty. If you are a nice person who wants to play EQ to enjoy the game and do a little adventuring then Rallos Zek is not for you. In fact, if you are the kind of person that enjoys playing the game and wants to have fun adventuring around Norrath then dont play on Zek. In that case, Rallos Zek is the worst server you can play on.

<P>Here me out, I have played many online fantasy role playing games before and I always found them to be fun (with an exception to UO). In those games I usually played a healer of some kind. Healers are put on this world to help people. Being the nice person that I am, I have always chose to take on a healing profession. This involves self sacrifice. Well! One thing I learned on the PvP srever is that there is no such thing as self sacrifice. Rallos Zek is a free for all, do whatever you want, anarchy. Here is an example:
<P>The other day I was Afk for a matter of minutes outside of Befallen and of course was immediately attacked. You see, when these scumbags realized we were afk and not fighting back, they decided to attack. Of course, this is one of the most cowardly things I have ever seen. Well, my roommate happens to gate me out in time but I still die becuase one of them used a DOT spell on me and I lost a half of a bubble of experience. We all know that DOT's in PvP are illegal now. Well this was the last straw for em and many of my friends.
<P>We have left the PvP server and are not sure if we will ever come back. I hate to say that I am giving these jerks such power over me but hey, screw 'em. I have come across too many people that will steal or murder you when they have an advantage and will not accept your duel or will not fight you when its an even fight. Or even better, they gang up on you 3 on 1 but when you do it to them they complain. Well, I say screw the PvP server and all of the jerks that are on it. This is not a blanket insult, there are many of you on this server that are true role players and this statement is not being said towards you. All the good people on this server know who they are and all the assholes know that they are warped minded individuals. And if you dont know, then when someone calls you one, they are probably right.
