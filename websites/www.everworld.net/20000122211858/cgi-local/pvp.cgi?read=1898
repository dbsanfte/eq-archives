<P>There are problems for certain to PVP as it stands now.

<BR>I wouldn't want to play any other way, but depth is required
<BR>that is not available right now.
<P>I'd like to suggest a few idea's, any one of which could add
<BR>an entirely different dimension to the game, helping longevity
<BR>and playability for everyone:
<P>1) Incentives for PKing races vs. your not your own
<P>a) Provide 'Trophies' that can be won, such as a Human hand
<P>or a Drow Ear for example. This would provide a valid and
<P>additional reason for the races to war against each other.
<P>Trophies would also allow for bragging rights and use in
<P>spells and such. That allows even for Barbarian's to
<P>fight dwarves or Ogres vs. Trolls without experience gain
<P>but a valid purpose.
<P>b) Experience for the slaying of 'Anti' races. For example,
<P>Drow would and could gain experience for slaying Humans
<P>along with the trophies that could be won. Vice Versa.
<P>c) Slavery of the races. Allow the evil races to enslave NPC
<P>or PC's (converted into NPC's after death). Yet again,
<P>another valid reason for evil to war against good and good
<P>to try and free their brethren. The slaves could be used
<P>to do menial (but profitable) labor, such as fishing.
<P>Heavily enslaved cities would become barren of PC's, prices
<P>would escalate and even supplies could become scarce.
<P>2) Incentives for the creation of Diplomacy and Internal politics
<P>a) New skills: Domination and Politics. Domination allows you
<P>to enforce Internal race politics without (necessarily) PKing
<P>of those in the same race. It allows you to command authority
<P>over others and cause them to lose Reputation or experience
<P>if they do not heed to your authority. Domination allows for
<P>moral and other law to be set by those with the highest
<P>Dominance skill in the local region. It could also grant
<P>the ability for taxes to be raised and enforced, etc.
<P>Politic skill creates the same situation vs. Race to Race
<P>diplomacy and dealings. Rather than a loss of experience,
<P>the overall relations between the races erodes and can lead
<P>to war over diplomatic differences. Politics should deal with
<P>issues that effect the realm, such as trade (affecting
<P>local prices), pacts and military agreements. These would help
<P>make the issues real and truly effect those who live in the
<P>land, benefiting or hurting the races.
<P>Domination and Politics actually go hand in hand, and should
<P>include the ability to raise taxes (for weapons and trade)
<P>as well as the drafting of soldiers for war and defense.
<P>If you agree with any of these idea's, don't contact me, contact
<BR>the Everquest ppl! Think of the reasons that these new incentives
<BR>could provide to everyone playing the game. PKing is no longer a
<BR>problem but an aspect to roleplaying and interacting. The races
<BR>really mean something then, both as allies and enemies. True
<BR>purpose is given to the Good and Evil in the races, and epic
<BR>struggle becomes a reality in the game, not a farsighted dream.
