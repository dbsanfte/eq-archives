<P>Every other person I pvp sends me a threatening tell.. 25% ask for the item I looted back. Where the hell did all the cry baby pussies come from , this is just a game people if you don't like dieing to a role playing murderer then please do not play the pvp server! Most people don't run around killing people all day because they all need to level but so many people say they are petitioning a gm that I exploit killed them.. They say "Yeah i have 5 friends that will report also if you don't give me my totem staff back" I say go ahead but I really should not say that.. I am walking a tight rope. With hundreds of petitions being logged the gm's would be looking for me to step out of line once and ban me. I think it's bullshit. It's getting like nazi germany , All these new guides are for are basically to snitch on anyone using a programming error in the game. I have seen guides unlisted watching me 3 times in the last three days 5 minutes after i logged on. I can imagine the people saying they are going to quit because i kill them all the time and the staff would rather eliminate the pk to please all the losers... I die all the time and never ask for my stuff back and have a good time wiht many of the battles. Thats why i joined the pvp server. If someone steals my kill i kill them. I fear just to think of the regular servers I bet kill stealing is so unstopable. Just build yourself a caster and steal any kill you like. Then talk shit to 50 people there because you know they can't touch you.. Sounds pretty boring to me. As for exp loss It fucking pisses me off so bad but on the other hand I love it. When I hit level 50 I will play for maybe a few weeks then quit. I love a challange and eq is A huge challange. If they took exp loss out i would cancel my account instantly and I think 25% of the people would. We worked our ass off getting to the level we are with exp loss in and then all the cry babies would just breeze levels. Well what do you expect , 60% of the players are probably dorks in real life. 60% of the players act like dorks in the game. Hey melvin lets get this guy banned for killing us. "Ok dexter That is a neato idea , rofl , lol , hehe , haha , hoho , You are so mean dexter . Can I poke you in the ass tonight? please!"
