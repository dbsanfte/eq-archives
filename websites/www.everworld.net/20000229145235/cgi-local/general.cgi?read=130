<P>>I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE GAME FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW HAVE A 10LVL MONK AND STARTED A BARD. i'VE BEEN PENCIL RPG'ING FOR 14 YRS SO i HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF HOW THESE SKILLS WORK IN OTHER GAMES.

<P>I CAN ONLY TALK ABOUT THE THING'S I HAVE NOTICED SO FAR. I PLAY ON A NON PK SERVER AND LIKE THE FACT THAT THE WIZ GET POWERFUL A LITTLE EARLIER. MAKES THEM ACTUALLY USEFUL TO JOIN A PARTY OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE TO SOLO FOR TOO LONG. WHO WANTS TO DIDVIDE EXP OUT TO A WIZ WHO WON'T BE USEFUL TIL LEVEL 30? ON THE WARRIORS I AGREE THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME UNIQUE SKILLS THE LEARNING ONE'S ENEMY WOULD BE NICE BUT WOULD KILLING SOMETHING IN A GROUP COUNT AS A KILL OR WOULD U HAVE TO KILL IT SOLO. THIS COULD GET FRUSTRATING EITHER WAY IF U NEED TO DO IT ALONE IT MIGHT NEVER INCREASE. BUT IF U CAN DO IT IN GROUP U CAN KILL ALOT OF RED CLASS CREATURE AND BE ABLE TO SOLO THEM WAY TO EARLY THIS COULD ACTUALLY REVERSE THE PROBLEM WITH WARRIORS. I WOULD SAY GIVE THEM A SOAK SKILL THAT WOUD ALLOW THEM TO REDUCE DAMAGE. ALSO MAYBE ACTUALLY GIVE THEM WEAPON SPECIALTIES A CERTAIN WEAPON RATHER THEN WHOLE CLASS. THESE COULD ALLOW THEM TO INCREASE SKILL HIGHER LIKE DUAL WIELD ON MONK MAXES 20pts HIGHER THEN ALL MY OTHER SKILL. WITH SPECIALTIES THESE COULD DO MORE DAMAGE OR GIVE QUICKER RECOVERY TIMES. AS FOR BINDING ABOVE HALF THAT IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE MONK MEND SKILL. I LIKE THE FACT THAT A WARRIOR MUST SEEK AIDTO RECOVE HIT POINTS IT IS THERE ONE FLAW. IF A WARRIOR WANT HE CAN BUY HEALING POTIONS.
<P>ABOUT THE SKILLS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON TAILORING AND AM FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT IS NOT IN BOOK. I THINK WOULD BE COOL IF THEY PUT ADV BOOK OUT OR MAYBE ALLOWED U TO QUEST FOR TAILORS AND THEY WOULD TELL U HOW TO MAKE SPECIAL ITEMS. FOR EXAMPLE IN QEYNOS U CAN QUEST FOR NPC AND HE WILL MAKE YOU RAT FUR CAP OR RAT PELT CAPE. THESE ARE NOT OVERPOWERING, SO WHY NOT MAKE QUEST FOR ALL INGREDIENTS SO U CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE FOR SELF. I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH COOLER IF U HAD TO QUEST TOL LEARN HOW TO MAKE THINGS ANYWAY.
<BR>I WOULD ALSO LOVE TO SEE PLACE IN GAME WHERE U CAN SCRIBBLE NOTE LIKE A JOURNAL OR SUCH. I HAVE THOUSANDS OF PAPERS SCATTERED ABOUT, WITH VARIOUS BIT'S OF INFO. WOULD BE GREAT IF GAME COULD KEEP TRACK OF STUFF FOR U BY JUST SAVING IT IN A JOURNAL.
<P>I AGREE MONSTERS ARE A LITTLE TO SMART BUT AI IS HARD TO PROGRAM SO NOT MUCH CAN BE DONE. I THINK THEY DID PRETTY GOOD JOB ON LOS AND HEARING SO NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN MUCH. THANK GOD THEY FINALLY GOT SAFE FALL FIXED ALTHOUGH CREATURES WILL FOLLOW CAN GIVE U A LITTLE LEAD.
<P>ON LONG RANGE I'VE ONLY USED THE STARS AND KNIVES SO FAR AND FOUND THEM ALMOST USELESS. I'M ALMOST ALWAYS TOO CLOSE OR TO FAR. I NEVER KNEW THERE WAS A MIN DIS ON A STAR. BUT APPARENTLY IF HE IS 10 FT FROM ME I'M TO CLOSE BECAUSE? i WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE A WAY TO RETACT THESE BACAUSE FOR THE LITTLE USE THEY PROVIDE THEY ARE FAR TO EXPENSIVE IF NOT IN MONEY IN TIME TO GO BACK AND PURCHASE THEM. I WENT OUT WITH LIKE 50 DAGGERS AND WITHIN LIKE 1 HR THEY WERE ALL GONE.
<P>ALL IN ALL I LOVE THE GAME BUT WOULD ALSO HOPE FOR SOME SLIGHT UPGRADES
