<P>Chapter X by Wisteria

<P>Borath caught up with Crimson Sun, Gar, Fornak and Elenya just as Crimson demanded, “Enough of this. We have reason to make haste.”
<P>“Mi’Lord, I am here,” he reported dutifully despite full knowledge that Crimson was aware of his arrival.
<P>The only acknowledgment was Crimson’s order, “Fornak, water this man’s horse,”
<P>Borath noted the addition of the limp man draped across Elenya’s horse, but asked no questions. The young man hurried to the water’s edge where Elenya was just beginning to move back up the bank toward her horse, though she would never be able to remount with her hands tied. Borath quickly filled his water skin and caught up to the girl. She flashed angry eyes at him that kept him from speaking to her. When they approached her mount, he turned to her and knelt, offering her his knee as a step. His voice whispered respectfully, “Mi’Lady.” When she accepted his offer and placed her foot upon his knee, his strong hands grasped her waist and lifted her into the air, standing out from under her weight. He set her gently into her saddle. Her face softened for a fleeting moment as she settled herself, but from the new height, her eyes landed on Crimson and she hardened again.
<P>Borath sighed and started toward his own horse, but paused in the turn to pour a mouthful of water into the new prisoner’s mouth.
<P>Dauthi spluttered with the water, swallowing it up side down. He remembered, as any bard with class would, to thank his benefactor, after all, he thought bitterly, “I like being hung from a horse’s arse and half drowned!” Borath did not appear to have heard it though. His mind was filled with Elenya’s face. Borath only partially heard Crimson’s voice call out, “Only two more hours, and our prize will be delivered. Let’s go!”
<P>Dauthi saw Borath’s expression as he mounted his horse. “For love of Marr! That one can be swayed to help us!” he whispered much softer than before.
<P>Elenya barely heard the words, but looked over at the moon-stuck face and smiled to herself. Indeed, he could be influenced for their betterment. She decided to be more aware of her surroundings rather than dwelling on her anger. From this point on, she watched and assessed every detail about everyone in the party. She would live through this. She would make it a learning experience and grow more powerful from it. She would!
<P>As the horses began moving again, the moon, still low on the horizon, drifted from behind a cloud and watched their progress.
<P>-------------------------------------
<P>E’gaile puttered around the barren camp for half an hour. Comments about the weather and the day’s events were completely ignored by the irritable gnome. He was not staring into the artifact like before, but his attention was fully focused on it.
<P>Finally, she broached the subject of Pigorsh’s friend. “Where did Glodain go?”
<P>Pigorsh did not respond to her. She tried again. “Do you suppose he went after the others alone?” This did cause an odd look on Pigorsh’s face, but no verbal response.
<P>E’gaile picked up her charred spell book, the only thing left to her now. “If you don’t know, I’m going to go find out. I just wish the moon would come up, so I could see better.”
<P>“Stop,” the gnome sounded upset, “He did go after them. But he promised to be back by morning. And he wants you here. Safe.”
<P>She turned on the gnome, a mix of fear and anger painted on her face, “Do you think he will come back by morning if he finds them?”
<P>Pigorsh did not answer.
<P>E’gaile started to cry tears that seemed to come easily as of late. “He will hunt them until they kill him. He will never come back!”
<P>Pigorsh sighed, wondering if this girl ever did anything without crying at some point in the process. “Friggin’ female, you’re probably right. We better go save his arse again.”
<P>There was little to do in order to be ready to move. Pigorsh put the artifact into his new pack and hefted it onto his shoulder. The two of them began following the trail left by so many travelers over the last few hours. Even in the dark they were able to follow it for quite some time. As the moon rose above the horizon, they came to a point where trails 'where the trails crossed over one another and went West. A smaller, but still visible trail lead South. Both studied the markings carefully, though it was Pigorsh who was able to decipher them.
<P>“A group …. probably Taurmon’s bunch, followed this trail to the West and then came back again. I don’t see any sign of Glodain. If we take the wrong trail and he does make it back by morning, then we won’t be there.”
<P>“We will leave a sign for him then. And he can follow us.”
<P>“What Girl? You think this is some friggin’ fairy tale? This is not Hanzfeld and Greddile with the little white pebbles!”
<P>E’gaile smiled, “That’s a good idea!” And she began casting around for rocks that suited her purpose. Less than five minutes later she had a single pronged arrow pointing South. “He’ll see that!”
<P>She strode along almost twenty feet before stopping to look back at Pigorsh. “I don’t see their markings anymore.”
<P>Pigorsh stomped up even with her and pointed to a pile of horse dung. “friggin’ female.”
<P>-------------------------------------
<BR>Glodain rested as best he could in the dark, but his mind was filled with the hunt of Crimson Sun. He never relaxed. His hand unconsciously moved to his chest, the scared skin barely palpable through his tunic. Long ago he wore a pendant with the holy symbol of Erollisi Marr on a long gold chain around his neck. He wore it no more. He didn’t need to. The image of that pendant was forever branded over his sternum. Marr protected him with the image over and over.
<BR>When the moon finally began to rise the clouds hid it, further frustrating both Glodain and Taurmon. But Glodain was a good tracker and one of Taurmon’s men was good. The two of them worked well together even in the inadequate light and they were able to inch along. Glodain was at least glad to be moving, even if slowly. When the clouds blew out of the way and the full moon shown her face on them, they very nearly jumped for joy, quickening their pace significantly.
<P>Crimson Sun slowed his mount and held his hand out silently. The party stopped without a sound and every eye scanned the surrounding area, though each person glanced back at Crimson often, waiting for a sign of what to do.
<P>He finally spoke, but all were forced to strain to hear. “This is the place. We will wait.”
<P>Orders were given silently when possible, and when words were necessary, they were hardly more than a breath. Time moved slowly and Crimson began to show signs of anxiety. After an hour, he spoke, “Where is he? Where is the necromancer?”
<P>It was Borath who answered, “I am here. I have been from the beginning.”
