<P>Chapter XI by Crimson Sun

<P>Crimson, his composure regained, stared impassively at the necromancer. Gar and Fornak took a step back. Silence reigned over the clearing for a minute before Gar spoke.
<BR>“Borath… yer the necromancer?”
<BR>“Yes, I am,” Borath replied. Foolish oaf, he thought. He would have served me better as a mindless zombie. At least they do not ask stupid questions.
<BR>“Why didn’t you say so sooner, Borath?”
<BR>Borath stared at Gar. He could see that the man was confused and frightened, but mostly confused. “First, my name is not Borath. You may call me… the Master. I came along to make sure that my investment was safe. One can never be too careful when dealing with mercenaries. If you had laid a wrong finger on her, you would not be living now. Fortunately, it appears that everything is in order. I assume you want your payment now, for I have no further need of your services.”
<BR>“Why do you want her?” Fornak asked.
<BR>The Master turned to face Fornak. “What does it matter to you?” he spat with venom in his voice. “You only need worry about whether or not I choose to pay you. Lucky for you, I will.” The necromancer laughed at his own “joke.” No one else found it funny.
<BR>“What about the other prisoner?” Crimson spoke. They were the first words he had said since Borath revealed that he was not Borath.
<BR>The Master turned suddenly to face Crimson, as if the shadow knight’s voice had scared him. Quickly, he recovered and walked over to the horse carrying the prisoners. The Master grabbed Dauthi by the cheeks and proceeded to examine him as one would a dog or a horse before purchasing it.
<BR>“Hey! Watch it!” the bard cried.
<BR>The necromancer let go of the Dauthi’s face. Satisfied with what he found, the Master replied, “Yes, I will take the bard too.”
<BR>“He will cost you more.”
<BR>The words were followed by an intense silence that lasted only a few seconds. The Master turned, his face red. “WHAT!?!” the Master roared. “You insolent bastard! What did you say?”
<BR>Gar and Fornak cringed. They looked at their boss, hoping what he did not mean what he said. Everyone stared at Crimson, the prisoners included, waiting for the shadow knight to respond.
<BR>“The bard will cost you more,” Crimson said without trace of emotion. From the tone of his voice, one would have thought that he was buying a drink at a tavern; not demanding money from a spell-caster.
<BR>The necromancer stared long and hard at the shadow knight. He appeared to be debating whether or not to slay the dark soldier where he stood. After several minutes, the Master spoke. “Very well, but I get the horse too.”
<BR>Gar and Fornak breathed a sigh of relief. Elenya and Dauthi grimaced. They had been hoping to escape in the chaos if a fight had broken out between Crimson and the necromancer. Crimson simply stood there, his arms crossed across his chest. However, a small smile had cracked his face. Only the Master saw this smile; it chilled his very soul (some would argue that he did not have one to begin with) and looked back to his recent purchases.
<BR>* * *
<BR>“How much farther, Pigorsh?”
<BR>“How the hell should I know?” the gnome replied. They had been walking for nearly an hour and saw no trace of life except for the horse hooves. “What do I look like? A friggin’ ranger? Yer the elf, you should know.”
<BR>E’gaile chose not to reply. She had been trying to start a conversation for the past hour. However, each attempt was rebuffed with a caustic response from Pigorsh. E’gaile could not understand why Pigorsh did not want to talk. It was a good way to pass the time as far as she was concerned. Pigorsh was probably just upset because she saved him from the evil stone.
<BR>They continued for several more minutes before Pigorsh suddenly stopped. “You hear that?”
<BR>E’gaile paused and cocked her head to the side. She did here some noise coming from the west. “Yes, I do. It sounds like… I have no idea. Groaning or creaking, something like that.”
<BR>Pigorsh held out his head. “Stay here, lass. I’ll go check it out.” Cautiously, Pigorsh stepped to his right and off the path. After twenty or so paces he stopped. “Well what in Marr’s name was that? I don’t see a friggin’ thing.” Pigorsh stomped his foot on the ground to show his anger. The ground groaned loudly in response and Pigorsh’s face went white. “Bloody hell!” he screamed as the ground swallowed him whole.
<BR>“Pigorsh!” E’gaile cried. She ran over to the pit and looked down. About twenty feet down, the gnome wizard rested upon a pile of dirt. “Pigorsh! Are you alright?”
<BR>“Oi!” the gnome said. He shook his head and looked around. “Aye, lass, I’m ok. Go get a branch or something to fish me out of here, will ya?”
<BR>As E’gaile turned to go get a branch, she heard Pigorsh say, “Hello? What have we here?”
<BR>* * *
<BR>“Soon, Crimson Sun, you will die,” Glodain spoke in a hushed tone. The six elves had been hiding in the trees outside the clearing where the shadow knight now stood. They had watched as the necromancer revealed himself and were now watching as Crimson and the necromancer argued over money. “Soon, you will die and I will return to my family.” Glodain turned to Taurmon. “When do we attack?”
<BR>The high elf paladin turned to face Glodain. “Now, but you are not part of the ‘we.’ You will save my niece.”
<BR>“What?!” Glodain yelled. Quickly he lowered his voice. “I will not be denied my vengeance.”
<BR>“No, probably not,” Taurmon replied, “but not this day. You will save my niece and bring her back to my house.”
<BR>Glodain glared at Taurmon. “No, I will not pass up this chance. Too long have I waited for this day and you will not stop me.” Glodain unsheathed his sword and stood. In a second he would charge into the clearing and strike the shadow knight down where he stood.
<BR>“You will obey me, Captain Glodain.”
<BR>Glodain’s heart dropped. His shoulders slumped and it was all he could do to stop from collapsing to the ground like a felled tree. “I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
<BR>“Yes you do, Captain Glodain. You will obey my orders or you will be tried for disobeying a superior and treason against the King of Feywithe. No knight has ever been tried for that before. Do you want to be the first?”
<BR>Glodain closed his eyes. So close only to be thwarted by a fellow knight, he thought. “How… how did you know?”
<BR>“At first I did not believe it myself. I, like everyone else, assumed you were dead. But then I remembered that you disappeared the same day that a red-haired human attacked your home village. That would explain your passion for finding and killing this man. You had everyone fooled, no one believe you were still alive. All thought that Glodain, Captain of the Woodland Guard, was killed by a human bandit. So, will you obey my orders or do I have to order my men to tie you up?”
<BR>Glodain closed his eyes and nodded. “I will obey, my lord.”
<BR>Taurmon put his hand on Glodain’s shoulder. “Excellent, I would hate to arrest a fellow knight.” Taurmon turned to his knights. “Ready? Good, the attack begins.”
<BR>“Wait, before you go, how does my family fare?”
<BR>“Your brother is good and well. He is still the lord of Oakwind. His son is also strong and healthy. I have never seen your sister, but I have heard of not bad news from he husband’s land.”
<BR>“What about Arwyn?”
<BR>Taurmon grimaced before speaking. “The Lady Arwyn has suffered from madness. She refuses to accept your death and is the only one who still believes you are alive. She was rejected all suitors that her father has sent to her.” Amazing a high elf could love a wood elf so strongly, Taurmon thought.
<BR>Glodain smiled weakly. “Thank you and Marr bless you.”
<BR>“And may Rodcet Nife watch over you.” Taurmon turned to his men. “It begins now.”
<BR>* * *
<BR>The Master stared at Crimson. “Here is your money, shadow knight. Spend it well.” The necromancer held a large bag in his hand and extended his arm toward the dark soldier. Crimson reached out to take it, but his hand never grabbed it.
<BR>The air was shattered by a strong war cry and five elves burst from the bushes. “What in the-” the necromancer said. “Kill them! Do not let them take what is mine!”
<BR>Gar and Fornak rushed forward to do battle. The Master began weaving his hands and speaking in the arcane tongue of magic-users. Crimson swung his arm down, grabbed a stone and in one fluid motion threw the stone at the leader elf. The rock caught the unarmored elf in the head and he collapsed backward, falling off his horse. Crimson grinned wryly and unsheathed his sword.
<BR>“Uncle!” Elenya cried. Tears welled up in her eyes as her uncle collapsed to the ground and did not rise. She screamed again when hands grabbed her waist. Suddenly a hand covered her mouth and she heard a voice from behind speak softly. “We do not want to alert the humans.”
<BR>The speaker lifted her off the horse and turned her around. Seeing his face, Elenya said, “Glodain! You’re alive!”
<BR>“Yes, thanks to your uncle.” Glodain bent down and cut the ropes that bound her feet. He then cut the bonds on her wrists.
<BR>Elenya stretched her hands and legs. “That feels much better. Quickly, let’s help my uncle’s men.” She turned to cast a spell when a strong hand grabbed her hand. Elenya turned to see Glodain holding her back. “What is it? I thought you wanted to kill that shadow knight.”
<BR>“I would love to, but your uncle ordered me to bring you home. I must obey.”
<BR>“What are you talking about? If you are not going to fight, let me go,” Elenya said, trying to squirm free from his grip. When she realized what he said, she stopped squirming. “Ordered?”
<BR>“I will explain later, but now we must leave.”
<BR>“Sorry to interrupt this reunion, but could someone please untie me?”
<BR>Glodain turned toward the voice to see another body on the horse. He had been so centered on his mission he failed to realize the other person. “Who are you?”
<BR>“I am Dauthi, graduate of the Bardic Collegium, full bard and singster.”
<BR>Glodain snickered. He always knew that bards and halflings were the ones most likely to run into trouble with the law. Even if Crimson was far from a law-abiding citizen, this bard was still tied up. “I’ll have you free in a moment.”
<BR>After his bonds were cut, Dauthi stretched his limbs and fingers. “Ah yes, that feels much better. Thank you… Glodain is it?”
<BR>The wood elf nodded in response. “We will talk later, now we need to put as much distance from these people as possible. Elenya, you know the way.”
<BR>Elenya nodded and cast one final glance at the battle. She then turned and ran into the brush, shortly followed by Dauthi. Glodain cast one final glance at the shadow knight. He considered disobeying his orders for a second and then shook his head. His family’s honor was more important than his vengeance. With a sigh, Glodain jumped into the brush behind Elenya and Dauthi.
<BR>* * *
<BR>Taurmon lifted himself off the ground and shook his head. “Ugh, my head,” he said. Looking around him, his heart dropped. All four of his knights were dead. Two were withered husks of their former selves and the other two had been slashed many times over. Two humans also lay on the ground. Taurmon grabbed his sword and rose to his feet, but was unable to stand for long. He collapsed to his knees and kneeled before the scene. The red-haired man walked over to him. His sword was coated in blood and Taurmon could see his own death in the man’s eyes.
<BR>“Rodcet, deliver me!” Taurmon cried.
<BR>Crimson smiled wickedly. “Wrong god, elf.” The shadow knight’s blade quickly descended and robbed the elf’s body of its head. Crimson stared at the headless corpse, still in its kneeling position, for a second and then kicked it over. His revelry was broken by the Master’s scream.
<BR>“Crimson, you son of an orc, you let them escape!”

&gt; Glodain unsheathed his sword and stood. In a 
&gt; second he would charge into the clearing and 
&gt; strike the shadow knight down where he 
&gt; stood. 
&gt; “You will obey me, Captain Glodain.” 
&gt; Glodain’s heart dropped. His shoulders 
&gt; slumped and it was all he could do to stop 
&gt; from collapsing to the ground like a felled 
&gt; tree. “I-I don’t know what you’re talking 
&gt; about.” 
&gt; “Yes you do, Captain Glodain. You will obey 
&gt; my orders or you will be tried for 
&gt; disobeying a superior and treason against 
&gt; the King of Feywithe. No knight has ever 
&gt; been tried for that before. Do you want to 
&gt; be the first?” 
&gt; Glodain closed his eyes. So close only to be 
&gt; thwarted by a fellow knight, he thought. 
&gt; “How… how did you know?”

&gt; “Ready? Good, the attack begins.” 
&gt; “Wait, before you go, how does my family

&gt; “Your brother is good and well. He is still 
&gt; the lord of Oakwind. His son is also strong

&gt; but I have heard of not bad news from he 
&gt; husband’s land.” 
&gt; “What about Arwyn?” 
&gt; Taurmon grimaced before speaking. “The Lady

&gt; Glodain smiled weakly. “Thank you and Marr

&gt; “And may Rodcet Nife watch over you.” 
&gt; Taurmon turned to his men. “It begins now.”

&gt; Gar and Fornak rushed forward to do battle. 
&gt; The Master began weaving his hands and 
&gt; speaking in the arcane tongue of 
&gt; magic-users. Crimson swung his arm down, 
&gt; grabbed a stone and in one fluid motion 
&gt; threw the stone at the leader elf. The rock 
&gt; caught the unarmored elf in the head and he 
&gt; collapsed backward, falling off his horse. 
&gt; Crimson grinned wryly and unsheathed his 
&gt; sword. 
&gt; “Uncle!” Elenya cried. Tears welled up in 
&gt; her eyes as her uncle collapsed to the 
&gt; ground and did not rise. She screamed again 
&gt; when hands grabbed her waist. Suddenly a 
&gt; hand covered her mouth and she heard a voice 
&gt; from behind speak softly. “We do not want to 
&gt; alert the humans.” 
&gt; The speaker lifted her off the horse and 
&gt; turned her around. Seeing his face, Elenya 
&gt; said, “Glodain! You’re alive!” 
&gt; “Yes, thanks to your uncle.” Glodain bent 
&gt; down and cut the ropes that bound her feet. 
&gt; He then cut the bonds on her wrists. 
&gt; Elenya stretched her hands and legs. “That 
&gt; feels much better. Quickly, let’s help my 
&gt; uncle’s men.” She turned to cast a spell 
&gt; when a strong hand grabbed her hand. Elenya 
&gt; turned to see Glodain holding her back. 
&gt; “What is it? I thought you wanted to kill 
&gt; that shadow knight.” 
&gt; “I would love to, but your uncle ordered me 
&gt; to bring you home. I must obey.” 
&gt; “What are you talking about? If you are not 
&gt; going to fight, let me go,” Elenya said, 
&gt; trying to squirm free from his grip. When 
&gt; she realized what he said, she stopped 
&gt; squirming. “Ordered?” 
&gt; “I will explain later, but now we must 
&gt; leave.” 
&gt; “Sorry to interrupt this reunion, but could 
&gt; someone please untie me?” 
&gt; Glodain turned toward the voice to see 
&gt; another body on the horse. He had been so 
&gt; centered on his mission he failed to realize 
&gt; the other person. “Who are you?” 
&gt; “I am Dauthi, graduate of the Bardic 
&gt; Collegium, full bard and singster.” 
&gt; Glodain snickered. He always knew that bards 
&gt; and halflings were the ones most likely to 
&gt; run into trouble with the law. Even if 
&gt; Crimson was far from a law-abiding citizen, 
&gt; this bard was still tied up. “I’ll have you 
&gt; free in a moment.” 
&gt; After his bonds were cut, Dauthi stretched 
&gt; his limbs and fingers. “Ah yes, that feels 
&gt; much better. Thank you… Glodain is it?” 
&gt; The wood elf nodded in response. “We will 
&gt; talk later, now we need to put as much 
&gt; distance from these people as possible. 
&gt; Elenya, you know the way.” 
&gt; Elenya nodded and cast one final glance at 
&gt; the battle. She then turned and ran into the 
&gt; brush, shortly followed by Dauthi. Glodain 
&gt; cast one final glance at the shadow knight. 
&gt; He considered disobeying his orders for a 
&gt; second and then shook his head. His family’s 
&gt; honor was more important than his vengeance. 
&gt; With a sigh, Glodain jumped into the brush 
&gt; behind Elenya and Dauthi. 
&gt; * * * 
&gt; Taurmon lifted himself off the ground and 
&gt; shook his head. “Ugh, my head,” he said. 
&gt; Looking around him, his heart dropped. All 
&gt; four of his knights were dead. Two were 
&gt; withered husks of their former selves and 
&gt; the other two had been slashed many times 
&gt; over. Two humans also lay on the ground. 
&gt; Taurmon grabbed his sword and rose to his 
&gt; feet, but was unable to stand for long. He 
&gt; collapsed to his knees and kneeled before 
&gt; the scene. The red-haired man walked over to 
&gt; him. His sword was coated in blood and 
&gt; Taurmon could see his own death in the man’s 
&gt; eyes. 
&gt; “Rodcet, deliver me!” Taurmon cried. 
&gt; Crimson smiled wickedly. “Wrong god, elf.” 
&gt; The shadow knight’s blade quickly descended 
&gt; and robbed the elf’s body of its head. 
&gt; Crimson stared at the headless corpse, still 
&gt; in its kneeling position, for a second and 
&gt; then kicked it over. His revelry was broken 
&gt; by the Master’s scream. 
&gt; “Crimson, you son of an orc, you let them 
&gt; escape!”
