<P>Is there ANYwhere we can go to see what they are doing? lets go over some real BIG obvious problems:

<P>1. Faction hits were not implemented properly. In a Duel/Guildwar and even a defensive situation the killer still takes a faction hit. Given we even agree to faction hits in the game for PvP they should at least address these issues. Imagine getting attacked by a Teir Dal....and YOU are a Teir Dal. Let's say you cannot take anymore faction hits for fear of being KOS in Neriak....you must flee. You cannot defend yourself...you must simply flee. The faction system in this case has made same Race pkers immune as their victims now won't even fight back! Jeez at least make the faction system viable before throwing it in.
<P>2. Better targeting. In large battles it seems like our targeting sytems go all to hell. /assist works when it wants to and forget about F7. What is so hard bout' getting the targeting system to not only work but by repeatedly hitting F7 (or another designated key) one could scroll through available targets.
<P>3. An auto attack/follow function for Melee types. Melee type are worthless becasue they are not as good as their NPC counterparts. At least give them the same powers as the NPCs in being able to track and follow an enemy w/o worrying over lags issues and other problems encountered when chasing someone in a virtual online world.
<P>4. Naked MAge syndrome. Hmmmph. Well I am thinking that if a mage is running around w/o any loot we must find some sort of penaty for his death....maybe being able to loot a spell from his spell book. This is rediculous that you can kill some clown and he just keeps coming back....time and time again...naked and with no worries for losing exp (lest u DOT him). Witht he faction system in place Naked Mages REALLY suck.
<P>5. Conning in PvP. How much fun would it be if there was no Yellow/Red or Blue in PvP? *grins* Lets just say that players either con RED (for you can attack them) or Green (for they are out of your level range). How often does a 24th level character jump a 28th? Not to often to be sure. A system such as this would make folks think before jumping someone :) Would surely be interesting. Speaking along these line how bout broadening the PvP range at higher levels? To small now.
<P>Fix this crap....then I'll get back to you. but these are significant issues that I cannot believe are nto being addressed by the programmers.
