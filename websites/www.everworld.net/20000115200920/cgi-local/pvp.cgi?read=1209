</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>All of your points are good and make sense DarkHelm. I actually know of more people currently playing on the Non-PvP servers now that tell me they WILL play +PvP server in Retail. They explained their original decision as just wanting to learn the game first during the month or so of beta then go to battle in retail. Additionally, many of the players starting this phase on the -PvP servers DID want to come to to the +PvP, BUT did not want to start all over again especially with the player wipe comin' up in 2 weeks.

<P>An additional item I would present is longevity of player loyalties to this game. In the past I have noticed that the majority of OLD time Veteren players on a massvely multiplayer game are +PvPers! The fact is that the game will get monotonous and boring after a time and folks will just plain be lookin' for something else to take their attention.
<P>Last item: The +PvP switch is a horrible idea. No disrespect to the developers, but they are foolin' themslelves with this one. Check this out:
<P>1. +PvP and -PvP together grouping. DOH...no spells can interact between them! A -PvP Cleric will not be able to HEAL a +PvP player. I see the necessity of rule to be sure, but how exactly will this encourage folks to go RED? How will they find folks to group with them? What if a freagin mummy diseases them? What if a nasty snake poisons them and they have 10hps left? How is this condusive to group play? If I played with it set up like this, I would not go red until 50th level! (and I am a hard core rplyer/pker) Surely I would play EQ, but only til' I got bored of waxing monsters.
<P>2. There are folks like me that just plain are not sure when to make the switch! The +PvP atmosphere with this type arrangement would make reds VERY rare and of varying levels. Good old fashioned group warfare will NOT exist, basically making +PvP disapeer other than an occasional 1 on 1 kill after some clown is almost dead and another walks up on him seeing an easy kill. (Don't forget how hard it is to get a quick kill, there will be very little 1 on 1 kills where one guy does NOT want to fight. All he has to do is run).
<P>3. Guilds will disapeer. What will be the sense of a guild if all you do is login and holler for the folks you have already met in game? Level differences will insure that the older folks don't hang with the younger. In the +PvP server guilds are a forum for us to get together/recruit/organize battles. Guilds like <a href="http://personal.lig.bellsouth.net/lig/g/r/grayrage/dbmain.htm>DarkenBane Company</a> will provide a place for folks to go offline to interact with others in a way that -PvP guilds can NEVER hope to compare with. +PvP will find more High and Low level characters interacting as the High level try to help the lower get better to help in battle situations.
<P>4. Can anyone explain to me what the languages are for? Because they surely are not used in the -PvP server, but we of the +PvP use them ALL the TiME! the developers implimented a unique and VERY cool comminications system that ONLY the +PvPers use!
<P>It is my belief that FAILING to have a +PvP server in the final would be a huge mistake. No threats, as I plan to play regardless....but it would definately not meet my expectations of the game if they left it out.
