<P>Guild Info

<P>Who we are:
<P>My name is Areis one of the founders of The Cabal, I used to be a member of another guild as well as some of the other members. However we were not completely satisfied with the previous guild we were members of, and decided to break away and form our own guild. We wanted a guild that was more active, where the members were closer, and they cared about the guild, and it's activities. So we created The Cabal a new guild that would correct all that was missing from the last guild. The name of the guild "CABAL" was picked because it means a group of people that work behind the scenes or in secret. We hope that the guild will be like that a group of people who are closely knit and work together. We are not just guys who go run around the land hacking and killing everything to lvl as quick as possible. We are in it for the roleplay elements more so than to power game our way through. EverQuest is a beatufil game (graphics wise and roleplay wise) so many things are possibly, and we wanted to create a guild that would embrace the roleplaying side and all of it's endless possibilites in EQ. This is why on the main page we say if you are just a casual player don't bother, we want people that will go to guild meetings and participate in guild events within the EQ world.
<P>Guild Setup:
<P>The guild will be set up in with a rankin system(which can be seen on the members area). The founders of the guild are called the GUILD MASTERS and have the most say in the running of the guild. Then we will have a Council that will advise the Guild Masters, the council will be made up of Lords. Lords will be responsible for a number of members that will be assigned to them (kinda like group leaders). The next rank will be Captains who will be the Lords second in command. Following Captains will be Knights (warriors that have helped the guild and display superior game skills). After Knights will be Squires who are basically newer members but have contributed somewhat to the guild. Finally the lowest class will be Peasents, where all new members will start. Each rank has a certain vote authority, peasents votes count less than higher levels, but if enough peasents vote then it can overule higher authorities (except Guild Masters). If the guild grows very large then we will create more groups and appoint new Lords over them, if it doesn't then the highest a new member can climb to is Captain... unless a Lord rersigns his or her postition. This will be the set up of the guild.
<P>Other Requirements:
<BR>We do have a few specific requirements, members have to participate in guild events (we eill kick inactive members), and their will be a small (in game money) fee just so we can get cool stuff as a guild. We also would like if the members would please have an ICQ number so that all can be reached easily, and it is also helpfull to use for guild meetings. ICQ is very cool program and can be got at ICQ.com.
<P>In Closing...
<BR>So if you are intrested by our guild please feel free to submit an application , and join us for what we feel will be something great! Hope to see you soon!
