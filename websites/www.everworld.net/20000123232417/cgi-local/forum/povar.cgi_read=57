<P>Before you begin reading the following, let me explain my motives behind

<BR>sending such a lengthy email. For one, chatting about ForeverQuest (whome my guild may be come the Povar division of, for more info email me at TaoToads@hotmail.com) with
<BR>some friends stirred a bit of RP fanaticism in me, so I went by
<BR>NorrathRP. I went to their Communal Hall, scrolled down and saw
<BR>something that attracted my eye. This post. Its remarkably similar to
<BR>what I had already pondered. If this interests you, email me (not the
<BR>list, email TaoToads@hotmail.com) and if I get a high level of feedback,
<BR>I'll put it forth to the developing FQP for Povar. I'd like to tack on
<BR>a few of my own creations/options with this city-state guild idea:
<BR>--real guilds could be mercenary bands, Religous orders, etc that
<BR>migrated from city-to-city or swore allegience to a city-state but
<BR>remained autonomous (happened in Crusades with the Knights Templar
<BR>swearing to protect Holy Land but reamining autonomous).
<BR>--totally PC city-states could arise from zones that have neutral
<BR>vendors (after all, an economy is needed by any nation) and they
<BR>interact with the NPC-PC city-states..
<P>And now, the post:
<P>A few days back, someone offered the idea of racial guilds. Next,
<BR>someone offered up faction guilds. Then I waded in with two big Good vs.
<BR>Evil guilds.
<P>In truth, each of these has its own strenghts and flaws. But
<BR>after stewing on all this for a couple days, I think I
<BR>have a system figured out that will make this really work. The key is
<BR>not to reinvent the wheel. Do what AD&D used to do - borrow from
<BR>medieval history. When you look back, you realize the cleanest,
<BR>simplest, most realistic solution is the most obvious one.
<P>A Fuedal System.
<P>In fuedal europe (which all high fantasy is based on) every
<BR>citizen swore fealty to Lord or King. This brought with it
<BR>responsibility and pride. Geoff of Camelot meant something. If Arthur
<BR>declared war upon the next kingdom, then YOU were at war with that
<BR>kingdom.
<P>Duty, honor, loyalty, brotherhood.
<P>For every man, a King.
<BR>Race, religion, and ethos bleed naturally into this.
<P>Usually, your own ethics will match with your
<BR>kingdom's. Exceptions will happen, of course. But that's what makes life
<BR>intereting. To truly roleplay High Fantasy, is to roleplay within a
<BR>fuedal system of some kind.
<P>So what's my proposal?
<P>Each city-state of Norrath becomes on huge guild. Neriak,
<BR>Kaladim, Qeynos, and so on. The "guildmasters" will be
<BR>NRStaff-controlled NPCs who are key government/military figures in that
<BR>town. The Generals, the Knight-Commanders, and so on. We'll research
<BR>with 989 the ethics of that particular city's ruler and a staff member
<BR>will dutifully roleplay that ruler's "right hand man" in a way that
<BR>makes sense, passing down orders from the King to his faithful subjects.
<P>We can work with the people at Heartstone and Forever Quest to
<BR>create a living breathing world with politics and wars and intrigue and
<BR>alliances. Norrath will come to life, combining the excitement of
<BR>PK with the drama of good roleplaying.
<P>Norrath - the Fuedal Wars.
<P>Some quick issues handled in FAQ format:
<P>Q: Why not races?
<P>A: By doing the city-state thing, you're doing racial
<BR>tension with a more realistic, political twist. It's the same, just a
<BR>bit better. And . . . a Drizzt type character has a chance of one day
<BR>swearing loyalty to Qeynos. (and possibly facing his own kin in battle.
<BR>very cool)
<P>Q: Why not good vs. evil?
<P>A: Well, this gets messy. For starters some of the gods
<BR>themselves stradle the line. We could argue forever about gods like
<BR>Rallos Zek and Bristlebane. More importantly, no Human Shadowknight
<BR>wants to walk around Qeynos with the title (evil). As the guild function
<BR>gives you a last name/title. Besides, its quite possible to have an evil
<BR>High Elf who loves Felwithe and his kin enough to fight beside them
<BR>against invaders.
<P>Also, it allows for unsual events. What if the ruler of
<BR>Felwithe and the ruler of Kelethin get heated about rights to the
<BR>forest? What if an elven war breaks out? This could not be possible with
<BR>good vs. evil.
<P>Q: Hmmm. Speaking of Shadow Knights, what would a human
<BR>Shadow Knight of Qeynos do in this scenario?
<P>A: Well, we'd have to double check the facts with Verant.
<BR>But my understanding is that Antonios Bayle is a good Paladin and that
<BR>the 'evil' folk of Qeynos are forced to slither about the sewers and
<BR>hide their art from his wrath. To me, this says they would never be
<BR>accepted in that society. To roleplay a character who lives that
<BR>underground lifestyle you wouldn't be concerned about fighting for god
<BR>and country. And if you were, it would be one of the other Kingdom's
<BR>where you'd feel more loyal. Neriak, perhaps. Or Paineel.
<P>Q: Will Norrath Roleplay dictate everything?
<P>A: Hmmm. Good question. There's a lot to be said for a
<BR>clean storyline. But as you know, we at Norrath Roleplay try to handle
<BR>everything as democratically as possible. I imagine it would be a hybrid
<BR>between these two approaches. An idea from someone's message post might
<BR>'mysteriously' find its way into the storyline. If a King's knights are
<BR>screaming for Ogre blood, he'd be wise to listen. So, we'll see.
<P>Q: What next?
<P>A: Next we have to figure out some details about the guild
<BR>system. Can a guild be at war with multiple guilds at once? This would
<BR>be great because it allows alliances to form. How do the guild titles
<BR>work? Are they always on. Optional? Should we enforce the flag to always
<BR>fly?
<P>Q: How many people can we get?
<P>A: I bet we can get a good half of the server to
<BR>contribute. People love mass events. Even roleplayers love violence. As
<BR>long it makes sense, and you don't lose all your money to some idiot for
<BR>no good reason. I think this'll be huge.
<P>That's it. Jump in the debate and voice your ideas.
<BR>This thing may be a reality within a week or two, if enough
<BR>people show interest. Now's your chance to shape it.
