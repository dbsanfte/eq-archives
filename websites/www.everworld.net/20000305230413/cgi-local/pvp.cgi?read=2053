<P>Ok I agree you like roleplaying PvP and such. Some don't, that's their right, but lets not talk about that. I want to talk about the instances you have been PKed. You said you were attacked 3 times by necros and you are a ranger. From on RP standpoint, why would they talk to you about it? They have every reason in the world to kill your fruity tree-huggin butt(don't take it personal). The 2 you arent sure whats, if they werent your race(or even if they were and knew ya), could still have RP reasons to kill ya. They need not discuss this with you. They attack when you are hurt? Well that's a shame, but you should be more careful. You get upset about the situations that happened. That is your fault not theirs. Let me tell you a little about my experiences.

<P>I PK from time to time, usually invis and on people that are fighting or hurt. I see no reason to give someone I am going to kill a fair shot at killing me. They can sneak up and do the same to me(if it is in character) or not(either is fine). I only attack good races(even if they are grouped with bad races I never initiate combat with bad races) and I rarely roleplay. I figure if I don't say anything and they are role-players, they can make up whatever reason they want. I will even go as far as to play along with their story when they start giving me tells. What "Children" is talking about is the people that send countless tells about how I get beat up at home, am a loser, going to get reported, etc. If your character is a whiner, fine RP whine all you want. If you are really a role-player like you say you are, you will come up with a reason for each person that PKs you. When playing paper RPGs the GM helps you with the story. In this game you have to do it all yourelf or with other RPers. If you want to /OOC name call, you are obviously on the wrong server. If you play on RZ you are gonna die by other players for whatever reason they decide. This you have to accept. No one group of players can "ruin" the server because if the group of players is large enough to "ruin" it then it will be run exactly how the majority of players want it run. As for the 99% sure the RZ server wasn't set up for... The RZ server was set up to make money, not for any other purpose. If they could get 100,000 more customers on RZ by adding a machine gun to the RZ server, I am sure they would find the time.
