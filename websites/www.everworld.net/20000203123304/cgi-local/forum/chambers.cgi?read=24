</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#F4D99F FACE=arial>
<P>> In the upcoming game, in the opinion of the

<BR>&gt; beta testers.. what is going to be required
<BR>&gt; for the rest of the (not 25,000) who haven't
<BR>&gt; played the game for months to keep up with
<BR>&gt; the rest who have. I am extremely
<BR>&gt; competetive and try to "keep
<BR>&gt; up"... Any tips on how to DO WHAT THEY
<BR>&gt; LEARNED TO DO THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR FIRST?
<BR>&gt; I started UO long after it was out and it
<BR>&gt; was fun while it lasted but a problem was
<BR>&gt; that there were SO many ppl SO far ahead due
<BR>&gt; to just playing time. I want to learn and
<BR>&gt; experience the game (wondering around lost)
<BR>&gt; like the rest of the beta testers.. Just
<BR>&gt; give me some tips on how not to get too far
<BR>&gt; behind. Ie. How to make money when i need
<BR>&gt; it. How to get skills practiced best.. etc.
<P>&gt; Thanks a lot for your help..
<BR>&gt; Good Luck with the game...
<P>&gt; See you there
<P><font color="gold"><font face="comic sans ms">Awfully broad question, but:
<P>Read the game manual front to back, then re-read it after playing for three hours, then re-read it again after playing for a dozen hours.
<P>Read class- and race-specific postings for your character on as many EQ message boards as you can find. Keep a notepad next to you when you play to jot down questions that occur to you as you're playing, and post those questions on the boards-- you'll likely get good answers.
<P>/con every enemy before engaging it.
<P>Try to join in groups, early and often, especially with players who were in beta. You'll get XP and cash faster, but subjective game experience even faster than that.
<P>Don't worry about running out of food & drink until you're level 5 -- when you're killed at level 1-4, you'll respawn with 5 units of each.
<P>Fish for cash. While fishing, practice other skills, like Sense Direction, which requires an incredible number of practices to improve, but becomes invaluable later on when you get beyond the newbie areas.
<P>Don't be afraid to ask higher-level players to help you find & retrieve your corpses.
<P>Share what you learn with others. Random acts of kindness are good for the karma, and pay compound interest in the long run.
<P>G'luck and enjoy adventuring in Norrath!
