<P>> Unfortunately, this is not just the case with fighters. The

<BR>&gt; major problems exist not in subtle class differences, but in the
<BR>&gt; fact that EverQuest simply was NOT designed to be a PVP game.
<BR>&gt; Against monsters, the classes are all fairly balanced, but when
<BR>&gt; it comes to PVP combat, all but 3 or 4 of the classes become
<BR>&gt; relatively obsolete. The changes necessary to make PVP viable
<BR>&gt; and workable in EQ are simply too large to ever come about. Even
<BR>&gt; if all the bugs and subtle problems are fixed with PVP, the
<BR>&gt; glaring flaws and imbalances will still exist, because there is
<BR>&gt; simply NO WAY to balance those flaws without in turn imbalancing
<BR>&gt; non-PVP players, and my prediction is, no matter how many people
<BR>&gt; get bored and go +PVP, the non-PVP will ALWAYS outnumber PVP by,
<BR>&gt; at the very, very, least, 4 to 1.
<P>I think maybe you are putting too much emphasis on PvP combat.
<P>While we all enjoy taking a moderately leveled character out and slaying enemies of our race/class/guild/whatever, the fact remains that a good portion of our time is going to be spent fighting NPCs and monsters. Killing other players, as challenging and exciting as it may be, does not advance our characters. It may be fun (and it may be the motivating factor for some players), but PvP combat will always take a backseat to PvE. Thus the imbalanaces between class A and class B in a "pure" PvP environment are less important than class balance in the OVERALL game world.
<P>Let me give a Real World (tm) analogy. Two of the more well-known aircraft in WWII were the British Spitfire and the American P-51D "Mustang". The Spit could out-climb, out-turn, and out-shoot the 'Stang -- think of it like a wizard in EQ. On the other hand, the Mustang was faster, had more armor, and saw FAR more action -- like a fighter in EQ. In a "pure" one-on-one environment (PvP), the Spitfire was <b>BY FAR</b> the better airplane. So why wasn't it used more? Because it only had enough fuel to stay in the air about 35 minutes, whereas the Mustang could stay aloft for over 90 minutes. For fighting the "bad guys" (PvE) by the time the Spit took off, and flew to a combat area it had maybe five or ten minutes of fuel before it would have to run home for more gas.
<P>For PvP dueling, yes, the majority of classes are simply NOT balanced in EQ. And I, for one, sincerely hope that they never are. I'm not playing EverDuel, the fantasy dueling game. I'm playing EverQuest, a fantasy role playing game, where I play a tiny unimportant cog on a sprocket in a giant machine.
<P>But then, you probably couldn't care less what I think.
