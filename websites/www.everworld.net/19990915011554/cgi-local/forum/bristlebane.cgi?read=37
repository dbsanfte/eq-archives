<P>BROTHERHOOD OF HIGH MAGIC

<P>Well met Erudite fellows and brothers of magic !
<P>I'm Artac, a Wizard from Erudin and a follower of Solusek Ro. I have just begun to feel the rush of magic in my blood but I already dream of turning my power into something of importance for me and my Brothers. We, Erudites, are a race of natural born magic-users. Magic flows in us like blood in our veins. We are the true masters of the arcane arts. We can't deny that they are others magic-users among the lesser races but they are only children dabbling with powers they don't and can't fully understand.
<P>WE ARE THE ONLY TRUE MAGIC-USERS in Norrath. We alone have the willpower to master all the secrets and powers magic has to offer us. We should not tolerate lesser races to boast about their so called mastery of magic. We should strive to become as powerful and as knowledgeable in magic as the Gods will let us. It should be a holy duty to us, a sacred quest. None shall stand in our way to the true source of power in Norrath.
<P>I suggest we join in a Guild, the Brotherhood of High Magic, to improve our skills in magic and to teach lesser races who are the real masters of magic.
<P>Here is the basic charter the Bortherhood should uphold :
<P>- Each Brother must strive to become a master of magic.
<BR>- Each Brother must help and support other guild members in any way he can.
<BR>- Each Brother must share his knowledge with all guild members.
<BR>- All Brothers must work together as one.
<BR>- Each Brother must investigate every opportunity to learn a new spell, to gain new magic powers and to own new magical items.
<BR>- Each Brother must prevent other races from stealing or learning magic secrets not designed for them to know.
<BR>- Each Brother must confront in a duel magic-users of lesser races to teach them who are the true masters of magic. Let them live to tell the others about their defeat. Kill them if they can't understand the lesson.
<BR>- Each Brother must protect by all means Erudin and its population from the lesser races.
<P>If you're a Erudite magic-user from Bristlebane, join our ranks. We could create a powerful Guild which will inspire respect in all other races of Norrath. Followers of Solusek Ro will be greatly appreciated.
<P>The name of the Guild and this charter are only a proposition and could be amended. I'm looking for fellow Erudites to help define our future Guild.
<P>So Brothers, if you're interested in becoming a future member of the Brotherhood of High Magic, contact me on korrig@club-internet.fr (French or English) or meet me around Erudin on Bristlebane. I'm quite often helping my fellows Erudites cleaning the Toxula Forest from the Kobold infestation.
<P>Artac, Wizard and Follower of Solusek Ro.

<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=50 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; BROTHERHOOD OF HIGH MAGIC 

&gt; Well met Erudite fellows and brothers of 
&gt; magic ! 

&gt; I'm Artac, a Wizard from Erudin and a 
&gt; follower of Solusek Ro. I have just begun to 
&gt; feel the rush of magic in my blood but I 
&gt; already dream of turning my power into 
&gt; something of importance for me and my 
&gt; Brothers. We, Erudites, are a race of 
&gt; natural born magic-users. Magic flows in us 
&gt; like blood in our veins. We are the true 
&gt; masters of the arcane arts. We can't deny 
&gt; that they are others magic-users among the 
&gt; lesser races but they are only children 
&gt; dabbling with powers they don't and can't 
&gt; fully understand. 

&gt; WE ARE THE ONLY TRUE MAGIC-USERS in Norrath. 
&gt; We alone have the willpower to master all 
&gt; the secrets and powers magic has to offer 
&gt; us. We should not tolerate lesser races to 
&gt; boast about their so called mastery of 
&gt; magic. We should strive to become as 
&gt; powerful and as knowledgeable in magic as 
&gt; the Gods will let us. It should be a holy 
&gt; duty to us, a sacred quest. None shall stand 
&gt; in our way to the true source of power in 
&gt; Norrath. 

&gt; I suggest we join in a Guild, the 
&gt; Brotherhood of High Magic, to improve our 
&gt; skills in magic and to teach lesser races 
&gt; who are the real masters of magic. 

&gt; Here is the basic charter the Bortherhood 
&gt; should uphold : 

&gt; - Each Brother must strive to become a 
&gt; master of magic. 
&gt; - Each Brother must help and support other 
&gt; guild members in any way he can. 
&gt; - Each Brother must share his knowledge with 
&gt; all guild members. 
&gt; - All Brothers must work together as one. 
&gt; - Each Brother must investigate every 
&gt; opportunity to learn a new spell, to gain 
&gt; new magic powers and to own new magical 
&gt; items. 
&gt; - Each Brother must prevent other races from 
&gt; stealing or learning magic secrets not 
&gt; designed for them to know. 
&gt; - Each Brother must confront in a duel 
&gt; magic-users of lesser races to teach them 
&gt; who are the true masters of magic. Let them 
&gt; live to tell the others about their defeat. 
&gt; Kill them if they can't understand the 
&gt; lesson. 
&gt; - Each Brother must protect by all means 
&gt; Erudin and its population from the lesser 
&gt; races. 

&gt; If you're a Erudite magic-user from 
&gt; Bristlebane, join our ranks. We could create 
&gt; a powerful Guild which will inspire respect 
&gt; in all other races of Norrath. Followers of 
&gt; Solusek Ro will be greatly appreciated. 

&gt; The name of the Guild and this charter are 
&gt; only a proposition and could be amended. I'm 
&gt; looking for fellow Erudites to help define 
&gt; our future Guild. 

&gt; So Brothers, if you're interested in 
&gt; becoming a future member of the Brotherhood 
&gt; of High Magic, contact me on 
&gt; korrig@club-internet.fr (French or English) 
&gt; or meet me around Erudin on Bristlebane. I'm 
&gt; quite often helping my fellows Erudites 
&gt; cleaning the Toxula Forest from the Kobold 
&gt; infestation.
