<P>Hey holydevil,

<P>I respect your opinions and thoughts on this matter about being a pker and all, but you have to realize that not all people are like you and want to go around killing people or being looted for treasure they received after two straight weeks of searching and fighting.
<P>I personally LOVE the idea of pvp characters and their opposites both being able to be included in the game. I don't know why you're so hostile or bad mouthed when you spoke so strongly against the idea of the pvp game switch, and personally, I can tell that I wouldn't like you if I got to know you. To me, you represent the hard-headed, unethical-probably-will-find-a-hack-to-cheat kinda people that I always come across in my internet games.
<P>So what if some people don't like fighting with other people? Why should you care about what they want? The majority of the players such as myself will be on the other end with the pvp players. Also, you might want to know that if you're not a pvp character, you can't heal teammates. See, there are big drawbacks to this switch for the "good guys."
<P>Just leave the guys who want a clean lone ranger kinda game alone. They think of a nice fun game in different terms than others like you.
<P>There IS looting in this game, if you read the features over at everquest.com. Also, you mentioned a "repetitive cycle" it sounds to me that you forgot to add "kill a wandering character, loot him....." In any game, if you play it too long, it will become repetitive. However, everquest has different missions assigned all the time, so that should cut down on the boredom encountered in the game.
<P>Before I end this response, I want you to know that you should probably get your mouth washed out. Not unless you're some punk 13-year old, then that would be fogivable (almost) to swear so much on the internet. Nobody will listen to your bitching if you swear every other word you little baby!
<P>Also, if you are just gonna go out pking people left and right and bitch and complain and be a little wuss online, then do us all a favor and follow through with your promise - DON'T BUY EVERQUEST! It seems to me you have a little growing up to do, little boy.
