<P>> I dunno who this guy thinks he is, but Id say hes got a serious

<BR>&gt; Superiority complex that is all in his head. I have also been in
<BR>&gt; UO since day one and I still play a Chaos and red Pk today. I
<BR>&gt; have heard many things about Hobbes but not 1 word about this so
<BR>&gt; called
<BR>&gt; "God" LOL just saying it makes me laugh teehee :P
<BR>&gt; I dunno where he gets off calling all the other true Pks from UO
<BR>&gt; lamer wannabes but since hes the one that is no longer on UO I
<BR>&gt; would have to say that you are the quitter lamer that should not
<BR>&gt; be running his mouth anywhere including hideing in an EQ board
<BR>&gt; such as this.
<P>Well seeing as how hobbes and myself were the #1 pkers in UO and we were the ones that caused the game to change so much it would seem a FACT that everyone that followed was a LAMER WANNABE. Including yourself.
<P>&gt; To be honest I have been on GL since the day after final started
<BR>&gt; and Hobbes is the only truely famous PvP char anyone even
<P>Maybe hobbes is the only one that anyone remembers but you can ask hobbes yourself 99% of the time he was pkilling I was right there. And I am remembered, I went back to UO less than 2 months ago after not playing for 6 months and had GM blacksmiths making me free armor and giving me free weapons because even after so long they thought I was the best player to ever grace the game UO.
<P>&gt; remembers or says 1 word about. GL and Atlantic were the only 2
<BR>&gt; TRUE PvP shards in UO and SiN has played and owned both servers
<P>Here you are being stupid. Before ANY of the SHARDS were put in there was only 1 server and Hobbes and myself OWNED it. If you try and dispute this you are just being stupid. So take your wanna be ass back to UO and your SHARD.
<P>&gt; at differenrt points of time GL is our home and we still lay
<BR>&gt; claim to it noone can touch us as the Motivating Chaos\PK guild.
<BR>&gt; by the way, back in the days u were famous any idiot could PK
<BR>&gt; tons of people I know i was there from the days of insta kill
<P>Oh so now I was famous? I thought noone remembered me?
<P>&gt; fireballs and Harm and other cheap PvP imbalances. so unless you
<BR>&gt; are a god on UO now dont run your damn mouth today UO is 90%
<P>UO is 90% lameness now. Beta was the only fun time in UO, before the GM's and programmers had a chance to F- that game up, the fact that you still play to this day tells me you are a moron. I Hope you stay on UO because you dont seem like the type person for EQ.
<P>&gt; melee for PvP since everyone has 100 resist and healing anotomy
<BR>&gt; mages are just balancing chars. I would challenge you anyday in
<BR>&gt; UO 1 on 1 with your original char Vs. my current 5 way Gm
<P>I dont have my UO account anymore. I canceled it 2 days after playing Everquest. The fact that you didnt means that you should go back to UO and leave us true EQ'ers alone.
<P>&gt; townfighter. on the EQ side I must say in between your stupid
<BR>&gt; and ignorant UO rambling you are on the Money. EQ NEEDS the same
<BR>&gt; type of danger element that true rampant PvP allows. I was Pked
<BR>&gt; as a newbie and you know what it feels bad, but until its gone
<BR>&gt; you dont realaize what a rush it is to know there is other
<BR>&gt; dangers around. plus if the damn "goodie Goodie" RPs
<BR>&gt; would travel in well diciplined groups u dont have to worry
<BR>&gt; about "gangbangs" becasue everyone in the group will
<BR>&gt; take one of the PKs on and it becomes a huge 1 on 1 battle but
<BR>&gt; the goodie goodies seem to always travel alone or with lamers
<BR>&gt; that recall or run the first red name they see therefore
<BR>&gt; causeing the unbalanced gangrape affect on the true fighters
<BR>&gt; that try to stay.
<BR>&gt; its not the Pks or PvPs fault that the "good" guys
<BR>&gt; never can fight or have the organizeation of the Pks or PvPs.
<BR>&gt; The truth is alot of the successful PvP guilds have RL military
<BR>&gt; leaders that are useing tactics learned in the military which
<BR>&gt; makes us with our "superior" chars and communication
<BR>&gt; unbeatable in affect.
<BR>&gt; so to all yall RPs or goodie goodie PvP chars its not us
<BR>&gt; exploiting its yalls own fault you get gangbanged in UO or EQ or
<BR>&gt; wherever you play.look at you members and freinds and blame them
<BR>&gt; for running casue they would rather have the 10k or 5 plat they
<BR>&gt; just made off a lame creature and to leave you there to fight on
<BR>&gt; uneven odds
<P>Wow actually stopped insulting me for a minute to talk the truth.
<P>&gt; than to have the glory and the feeling they fought with teamwork
<BR>&gt; and possibly won against the Evil Pks. I know this is very
<BR>&gt; possible since at one point I was in a very good antiPK guild
<BR>&gt; that could hang with any Red Pk guild we had numbers and all of
<BR>&gt; us were over 20 years old and fought as a tight military unit.
<BR>&gt; Our leader was a 10 year Army Ranger Sargeant with actaul war
<BR>&gt; deploys under his belt. Most of the members were all ex military
<BR>&gt; from different branches and we worked fantastic as a team. So
<BR>&gt; that goes to show you that PvP is not imbalanced its just in who
<BR>&gt; is on Evil or Good sides and how they play as parties. Its not
<BR>&gt; our fault a single Blue RP walks into ambush point that was set
<BR>&gt; for a much larger Anti guild to walk into but thats how all the
<BR>&gt; good guys feel when they get raped that we were there to kill
<BR>&gt; the newbies or the solos when in fatch they had stubled upon a
<BR>&gt; warzone and became the causulty. well enough of this infernal
<BR>&gt; rant... Whitewolf flame if you want but i give a nats butt what
<BR>&gt; you think I was and still am there. and you arnt but instead u
<BR>&gt; in here running you mouth over long forgotten deeds... CV-SiN
<P>The fact that you stated I am remembered completely nullifies your own statement that I am talking of forgotten deeds. Hah I feel sorry for people like you that defeat your own statements within the same text paragraph. hahaha lamer
