<P>Websters Dictionary defines Monopoly as one of the following:

<P>1 : exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action
<BR>2 : exclusive possession or control
<BR>3 : a commodity controlled by one party
<BR>4 : one that has a monopoly
<P>My definition of a Monopoly is:
<P>When a company or PERSON has the ability to create and supply a much desired product and controls the market by regulating and enforcing the prices of such products.
<P>The similarity of the two definitions is that Monopolies are wrong! They promote greed, selfishness, and egotistical behavior. As some of you may have noticed, there IS such a product that is desired. This product can be produced by only a handful of smiths all around Norrath. As you may have guessed by now, it is the much desired Banded Mail. It is a known fact that Banded Mail is cheap to make (although time consuming) and has better Armor Class of Chain Mail, lighter weight then Chain Mail, and it can be sold for a lot less then Chain Mail. These simple facts are what started the Blacksmithing craze. Don't fret though. I predict that within the next coming weeks, the market will either be flooded with smiths OR everyone will own Banded Mail.
<P>However, this is not my concern. My concern for the time being is that a particular person within our very own community of Norrath strives to Monopolize the Blacksmithing market by regulating the prices of Banded Mail. Any smith that is not with his little "association of smiths" is considered an enemy and threat to him. If you do not yet know who I am talking about, it is a person by the name of Shiron. In my dealings with him in the past, I have found him to be rude, selfish, greedy, egotistical, and a dominating control freak (for lack of better words). This is only my opinion and you may have your own. Maybe he is your best friend, a good acquaintance or your worst enemy.
<P>When I started smithing, I did not know much about Shiron other then he was another smith. Well yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting him. Some things he said to me was, "by the time you are near my level you will be bankrupt". "If you want to start a price war, you will lose". "My association of smiths has predetermined prices for selling Banded Mail which should be followed". "You can either follow my rules and become rich like me, or you can go bankrupt. The choice is yours". Now, I do not even know the guy, and he bombards me with these kinds of tells! I explain to him that my intention is not to start a price war but to sell Banded Armor for a fair price while making enough money so that I can continue the trade. I do not know if he is jealous that I can afford to sell armor at a cheaper rate then him or what the deal is.
<P>His retaliation was to sell Banded Boots for 3 platnum each. A great deal as anyone can see, but a childish way to leash out at one person. I believe he was selling them originally for 12 plat and my price was 6 plat. Again, just enough so that if I sell a pair, I can make another 2 pair. He says that he can "pump out a lot of boots and sell them near cost." I do not know if that was a threat to me or not, but I was laughing inside. He is only hurting himself not me. He will only make 1 platnum on the deal since it cost a little over 1.5 platnum to make boots. That means, if he fail once, he would lose money. If he failed 1 out of 3 times, he would break even. I do not see his logic here.
<P>Now, to anyone that is associated with Shiron and his controlled method of setting prices, I have to ask why? Why do you agree to his prices and why do you conform to his ways? If you do not know already, Shiron refers to you as "his association of smiths". So I apologize for how this may sound but there is no other way I can put it except, how does it feel to be Shiron's bitch? You are gonna let him say that it is HIS association and let HIM control the prices. If so, then why not start a Merchants Guild with him as your leader? I am sorry, but I would never lower myself to that. I have fair prices and if I can afford to sell armor at a cheaper rate then what the "suggested retail price is" then I am going to and that is my right! I do not tell you to use my prices so I ask that you do not tell me to use yours.
<P>So, can one person make a difference? YES. Apparently Shiron feels threatened by me, and I am only one person. Can a Monopoly be stopped if there are now rules and regulations to govern it? YES. However, this I can not do alone. It will take ALL people of Norrath that wish to buy Banded Armor. I am NOT saying "buy from me" what I am saying is "do not buy from Shiron or anyone that is associated with him." This will stop his Monopoly. Before you purchase Banded Mail, ask the smith selling it if he is associated with Shiron. If they say yes, then I urge you not to buy it. If they say no, then by all means buy it. But what if he says no and he really is associated with Shiron? To this I say GOOD. It shows that they are ashamed to be known as associates of him and that is all the satisfaction I need.
<P>There are three advantages I have over Shiron. The first is that I possess an item that allows me to purchase materials needed at a slightly lower cost. The second is that I have learned to never tell what your true smithing skill is to anyone you do not trust. So, Shiron is underestimating me when he says "you will be bankrupt by the time you are near my skill level". His underestimation will be a prime factor in his downfall. The last and MOST IMPORTANT thing is that I believe in the people of Norrath. I KNOW that the majority of Norrath would rather buy an item from a good and humble person then from an egotistical and greedy person. Even if the price of the item is a little higher then what the egotistical person is selling it for. Like I said, most of my items are cheaper. I would imagine that if Shiron reads this or someone passes it on to him, his prices will drop. Probably lower then mine. Like I said before, my intention is not to start a price war, so if he can afford to sell lower then me, by all means, go ahead. I will not drop my prices any lower because I know they are fair and I KNOW the good people of Norrath will do the right thing.
<P>Let me also point out that Shiron lacks any business ethics. He also needs a lesson in common courtesy. When he announced yesterday that he was selling "Banded Boots for 3 plat" he got many tells as you can imagine. Most of which were most likely, "How much are boots?" I guess people thought he accidentally typed 3 plat. Shiron then proceeds to /shout "Anyone that asks me again how much Boots are is going on ignore." This REALLY made me laugh. Besides showing his rudeness to all the people in GFay at that time, he more then likely lost business and customers. Why would any Merchant put a potential customer on /ignore is beyond me.
<P>In closing, I am not one to bad mouth anyone. I am but a humble smith, a servant of the people. I just wanted to tell the Truth to all the people of server Veeshan and to all the people of the world we call Norrath. Shiron himself brought me to this. If he just kept his ignorant comments to himself, I would have no problem. Now this "rant" is not meant to be a recruitment letter, but if you check out my guilds website at www.sacredhaven.com, on the main page you will see our charter. On the charter we have two specific "laws" our members try to live by (Roleplay by). The first one is "NOBILITY, having the utmost respect and compassion for others, not because of their station in life but for their actions which define their lives." The second one is, "HONOR, conducting oneself with bravery in the face of battle and integrity in one's dealings with others." In my opinion, Shiron is not Noble because the actions which defines himself are unjust. He is also honorless since he has no integrity when dealing with others. I am not saying that you all have to follow these rules, that would be silly. I just ask that you recognize the fact that our guild follows them and hope you can see why he is considered an enemy. We hold no grudges, if his attitude changes in the future, I will have no problem with him. IT takes a big person to change and admit they were wrong, and I don't think Shiron is ready for that now and probably ever will be. He is to hyped up on his power trip. The power trip he gets off of everyone that buys from him.
<P>I know that the people of Norrath will do the right thing. I have faith that the people of Norrath will not stand for this type of behavior from anyone. Any comments? Do you agree? Disagree? I welcome intelligent comments. I welcome valid flames. I do not welcome ignorant comments or flames. Long live Tunare! Long live Mithanial Marr! Long live the good people of Norrath! Long live the Sacred Haven!
<P>p.s.
<P>This is addressed to Kynneth, a member of the Guardians of Light. Kynneth, about 4 paragraphs above I mentioned that one advantage I have was to not tell my true smithing skill to anyone I do not trust. Despite any slight differences we had in the past, I trust you. So you know my true ability, if you still remember what I told you. If Shiron or another comes to you and asks what my ability is, I trust you. That is all I have to say.

&gt; &quot;My association of smiths has 
&gt; predetermined prices for selling Banded Mail 
&gt; which should be followed&quot;. &quot;You 
&gt; can either follow my rules and become rich

&gt; in one's dealings with others.&quot; In my 
&gt; opinion, Shiron is not Noble because the 
&gt; actions which defines himself are unjust. He 
&gt; is also honorless since he has no integrity 
&gt; when dealing with others. I am not saying 
&gt; that you all have to follow these rules, 
&gt; that would be silly. I just ask that you 
&gt; recognize the fact that our guild follows 
&gt; them and hope you can see why he is 
&gt; considered an enemy. We hold no grudges, if 
&gt; his attitude changes in the future, I will 
&gt; have no problem with him. IT takes a big 
&gt; person to change and admit they were wrong, 
&gt; and I don't think Shiron is ready for that 
&gt; now and probably ever will be. He is to 
&gt; hyped up on his power trip. The power trip 
&gt; he gets off of everyone that buys from him. 

&gt; I know that the people of Norrath will do 
&gt; the right thing. I have faith that the 
&gt; people of Norrath will not stand for this 
&gt; type of behavior from anyone. Any comments? 
&gt; Do you agree? Disagree? I welcome 
&gt; intelligent comments. I welcome valid 
&gt; flames. I do not welcome ignorant comments 
&gt; or flames. Long live Tunare! Long live 
&gt; Mithanial Marr! Long live the good people of 
&gt; Norrath! Long live the Sacred Haven! 

&gt; p.s. 

&gt; This is addressed to Kynneth, a member of 
&gt; the Guardians of Light. Kynneth, about 4 
&gt; paragraphs above I mentioned that one 
&gt; advantage I have was to not tell my true 
&gt; smithing skill to anyone I do not trust. 
&gt; Despite any slight differences we had in the 
&gt; past, I trust you. So you know my true 
&gt; ability, if you still remember what I told 
&gt; you. If Shiron or another comes to you and 
&gt; asks what my ability is, I trust you. That 
&gt; is all I have to say.
