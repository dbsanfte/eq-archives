<P>> 1. I love how people live in the past. UO is old news. I do not

<BR>&gt; judge anyone in EQ on who they were in UO. That was a totally
<BR>&gt; different game.
<P>People forge reputations in whatever forum they exist or have existed in. CC formed it's reputation as the best, whereas you formed your reputation as a gimp, and then as an exploiting gimp who, despite all the abused bugs, continued to fall into the role of my little bitch ;)
<P>&gt; 2. I feel I'm doing quite fine for what limited playing time I
<BR>&gt; have. Between 60 hours of work and school, I don't have much
<BR>&gt; game time.
<P>Nobody cares how you're doing, I'm one of the few here who even knows who you are and that in itself is a compliment ;) I have to admit it put a smile on my face to see this blatant cry for attention though... 'Look at me! Someone talk about me!' Rofl.
<P>&gt; 3. Do I care that you can slay gimps? I find it lame that you
<BR>&gt; take screenshots of that shit. I took out about 25 humans
<BR>&gt; yesterday in 3 hours of playing (most of the time was spent
<BR>&gt; returning to town to buy new spells with the loot or meding)
<P>Judging from the past and your many 'claims', this would translate to you killing 2 humans in 5-6 hours of playing. You were always full of shit Raingimp and I saw it more than anyone else as you were always suckling at my teat begging for some form of approval from your better.
<P>&gt; 4. Is it a leveling race? Thats what it soons like CC Council is
<BR>&gt; doing. HA! I can kill you when I'm 4 levels above you!!!!
<BR>&gt; Screenshot time!
<P>You've seen my screenshots from Phase 4, you saw a recent group of screenshots detailing the 6 on 6 battle vs the pluggers where we lost not a man. You're desperation shines so brightly it's blinding :)
<P>&gt; 5. I was nothing in UO? If I was nothing, then why must people
<BR>&gt; say I used Skip? If I sucked, then it would be irrelevant if I
<BR>&gt; used Skip or not. If my WHOLE account sucked so bad, then why
<BR>&gt; was I able to sell it for $300 and the guy who bought it almost
<BR>&gt; NEVER played Rainman.... maybe because I had some other kick ass
<BR>&gt; guys? HMMMMMM
<P>Everyone and their mother was offered a fortune for their UO accounts. That you claim this as a reason for being 'something' then i need go no further to prove the point :) Otherwise, I could simply mention you were a friendless, immature, adolescent little cling-on constantly shooting off his foul mouth and promptly having a boot shoved down his throat.
<P>&gt; 6. Leoric, wasn't it me who helped you loot a house with your
<BR>&gt; thief in UO? I remember you saying wow you are damn good after I
<BR>&gt; took out 5 members of the house allowing you to loot it.
<P>How is this relevent in the least? Lose the petty attempts at grasping a bit of glory vis the CC name and try actually accomplishing something for once. Being widely known as one of the biggest bug exploiters in a game doesn't make you 'someone' ya pre-pubescent moron roflmao.
<P>&gt; Rainmann - I have no problems with CC, I have a problem with
<BR>&gt; them claiming domiance when I have yet to see them kill someone
<BR>&gt; (and who gives a fuck about BETA, it was BETA and no one takes
<BR>&gt; BETA seriously and if you do, you are a loser). Beta is made to
<BR>&gt; fuck around and do dumb stuff while you learn the basics of the
<BR>&gt; game.
<P>We claim dominance wherever we go and challenge any and all to take it from us or prove it is a false claim. As for Beta...all who played beta actively CARE about it since we dedicated many hours to playing it. You calling anyone who mentions beta a 'loser' calls attention to the only real loser in this thread gimp. Don't knock the blessed beta days simply because you were a permanewb ;)
