<P>Note: You should be in a party of level 12's+ to do this, or get someone that is powerful to do your dirty work.

<P>This journal outlines how to get to the Infected Paw dungeon in Southern Karana from Neriak.
<P>At level 12, you should probably be familiar with Nektulos forest and East Commonlands. You may even be familiar with North Ro and Ro Oasis.
<P>Zone to East commonlands and go straight through the abandoned village (plague village). Keep going to the mountains and walk through the tunnel to Northern Ro.
<P>In Northern Ro, follow the wall on your right and zone into Oasis.
<P>In Oasis, the fun begins. You can invis yourself or get someone to invis you and hang along the right-hand wall until you find the exit to Southern Ro. Or, you can make a b-line to the water and swim within range of the right shore to the dock. From the dock, make a straight shot to the pass to Southern Ro.
<P>Southern Ro is pretty easy to cross, just watch out for Dry Bone Skeletons, a few Madmen, some Orcs, etc. You should cross into the Innothule swamp.
<P>The Feerrott zone is across the Innothule, but it's easier to not miss it by hanging out along the right wall. If you want to take a pit stop, take a left instead of a right, pass by Upper Guk's entrance and you will come to Grobb in the corner. I prefer to stop in Oggok, though.
<P>In Feerrott, follow the path til you come to the river and the stone bridge (not the wooden bridge). Oggok is on the right wall as you come out of the pass, if you want to stop there for a bind. I recommend binding in one of the two cities (Oggok or Grobb).
<P>Cross the bridge and follow the path. It will fork left, keep to the right path and you will come to the pass into Rathe mountains.
<P>Rathe mountains are huge. We spent a total of three hours one night mapping it. I finally got a good, fast, path out of the zone. Here are the steps to get through it:
<P>1) Go to the middle fork when you exit the pass.
<P>2) Stay on the right-side of the canyon and follow it around as it curves to the right. Watch out for cyclops, giant skeletons, and hill giants.
<P>3) When you see a monolith that is tannish brown, there will be a split to the right and left. Take the right split, but cross the canyon and start following the wall on the left after you go through the right split. Watchout for the scarab-like beetles that hang out near the monolith.
<P>4) Follow the left wall around past the inn. The inn is friendly to drow. Just past the inn is a pass which ends your journey along the left wall. Enter into the pass and follow the opposite wall on the right. It will lead you to the pass for the Rathtear lake.
<P>In the lake zone, go straight to the dock and hop on the boat. Right-click on the boat to navigate and right-click on the boat to stop navigation. Follow the right shore (not too close) past the orcs, a cabin, and finally you will see a dock. Make your landing at the shore a good ways from the dock and climb up the mountainside to the abandoned huts. Below you, will be a bunch of baddies. Follow the canyon on the right and you will pass into Southern Karana.
<P>The Infected Paw is at location 780, -3200 or so. Use your /loc command to guide yourself. The tree houses you see near the entrance to this zone are not hostile to dark elves.
<P>Now, in Infected Paw, most of the gnolls should be easy. If you come to a room that has four shamans sitting in place, simply turn around and look elsewhere. The mob that holds the staff is a named necromancer or named shadowknight. The staff they yield is the Ruined Totem Staff (base damage modifier 9 and is magical). You can do 18-20 damage on good swings with this staff and is a must for all magic users at lower levels.
<P>Good luck!
