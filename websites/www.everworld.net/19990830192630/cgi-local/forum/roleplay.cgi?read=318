<P>*... Fen watches as the seething dark elf kicks the plank out from under the northmen, sending them cursing into the icy waters. Pursing his lips, looking idley back and forth between the shadow knight, the druid, and the purse snatching bastard, Fen turns toward Cathal and puts an arm around his shoulder, digging his fingers into the rogue's arm.*

<P>"It's nice to feel wanted." he mumbles sarcasticly, walking towards the bow of the ship, steering Cathal roughly with him as he goes. Turning to look into the other man in the face, Fen again squints hard at the bastard he had been itching to poke in the eye with his now lost parrying dagger.
<P>"First off," he half whispers, still grasping Cathl roughly about the shoulders, their backs turned to the others on the ship, "I dunno the first damn thing about bloody ships. I for one hate the ocean and all the wet little crawlies in it. Secondly, I ain't too damn happy about bein' in debt to this dark elf. Hells, he hardly did us a favor, all told. l mean, just how hard is it to escape from 'Freeport's finest', anyways? They're a joke when they're at their best."
<P>Feigning a discusion dealing with the trials and tribulations of setting a ship to sea, Fen turns and points high up the main mast, spewing some gibberish like : "Gonna have to swab the poop deck and misen the gaff".
<P>"Third," he mutters, turning back into the huddle, yanking Cathal closer, " I sure as damn hell ain't gonna go out to sea after some woman I couldn't care a jack about. And fourth, while northmen as a whole tend to get my goat, those two that our shadow knight here just dunked in the drink aren't bad fellas. I'd feel downright bad skippin' out on them after they paid me to find this redhead... my payment bein' the coin you took from me like the rat bastard purse snatcher you are. We'll discuss that thoroughly later, though. And we will... but for now, my man, we gotta think serious about just what our next course of action is gonna be..."
<P>Again turning from their plotting, Fen cocks his thumb at the deckhouse and grumbles a line dealing with "raising the starboard and cutting the midrift".
<P>*Looking intensely at the other rogue, Fen once again resists the urge to strangle the man. Later. He could do that later.*
<P>"So, bastard, where do you stand on this?" he mutters, turning slightly to make sure the shadow knight wasn't in the process of stalking up to "prompt" them into action.
