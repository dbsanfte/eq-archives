</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>I found your response to my post to be thoughtful and

<BR>insightful -- presenting the perspective of a responsible
<BR>PK. I will admit though, considering my experiences on MUDS
<BR>and UO (brief as that was), I don't believe what you propose could
<BR>work.
<P>&gt; That's just it. The ideal goal here is to eliminate
<BR>&gt; "random" PK. Certainly now this ideal is a long way
<BR>&gt; off, not technologically but systematically speaking, but that
<BR>&gt; is the goal of my systems and suggestions. Roleplaying is
<BR>&gt; supposed to be just that, playing a "role," not
<BR>&gt; carrying out random actions based on your desire to infringe on
<BR>&gt; someone else's fun. If you have mouthed off to someone, made too
<BR>&gt; many enemies, stepped on too many toes, or put your nose where
<BR>&gt; it doesn't belong; then maybe it needs a punching. If you prefer
<BR>&gt; not to PK, then you avoid interefering with people, you avoid
<BR>&gt; "pissing people off" and you basically avoid trouble.
<BR>&gt; "Random" PK is what I refer to as PK Abuse. My goal is
<BR>&gt; to curtail or eliminate this through a system of severe
<BR>&gt; punishments for repeat PK offenders and administrative
<BR>&gt; intervention for PKillers who are not doing so in the context of
<BR>&gt; a "role."
<P>If what you say could be properly implemented -- the elimination
<BR>of random PK -- then perhaps the +PvP and -PvP camps could
<BR>live together in peace, but as a cynic, I can't help but feel
<BR>there will be someone out there to exploit PvP no matter how strict the penalty.
<BR>And also, how stiff a punishment can the game really provide? It's like real life: a
<BR>sociopathic person, no matter the threat of prison, public censure,
<BR>etc., will behave sociopathically. Prison, death row, etc. have done
<BR>little to prevent real people from committing crime. In fact, crime rates have risen.
<BR>In a fantasy world, where violence -- be it P v NPC or PvP is the norm -- I doubt these types
<BR>of punishments could work. The question here is how do you create a credible
<BR>system of punishment? If punished, wouldn't a PK just start a new character?
<BR>Will being kicked out of the cities stop PK's from flourishing in the countryside?
<BR>How do you punish a paying customer for "bad" behavior? You can't ban a
<BR>paying customer who is only doing what the game system allows them to do.
<BR>That's why I think the switch is the only real solution to the random PK problem.
<BR>It's a compromise solution, but it's the only one that doesn't completely infringe
<BR>on the rights of either side (though there's +PvP's and -PvP's who complain that
<BR>it does, that we still have share the game with each other even when we can't
<BR>fight oneanother).
<P>&gt; Herein lies a partial explanation as to why I support universal
<BR>&gt; PK. If done well, Playerkilling adds an element of fear unlike
<BR>&gt; the unpleasnat fear of real life, because we know "it's
<BR>&gt; just a game." The idea of being involved in an assault or a
<BR>&gt; burglary or robbery or murder, etc. in a fantasy world is more
<BR>&gt; appealing that in real life, even from the victim's standpoint.
<BR>&gt; Systems do exist which will make playerkilling less of a burdgen
<BR>&gt; and more of a feature. Yes, currently these systems are lacking
<BR>&gt; and unsuccessful, but the potential is there to correct past
<BR>&gt; mistakes - instead of avoiding the problem with the PvP switch.
<P>Ah, here's where I completely disagree. Living in the Washington, D.C.
<BR>metropolitan area, I exist in a constant state of fear. Walking my dog at
<BR>1 in the morning, passing drug dealers in the neighborhood playground (where
<BR>the kids are afraid to play) is completely unnerving. Why then, would I want that
<BR>sense of random fear in a videogame, which is primarily an escape, a stress
<BR>reliever if you will? Quake, Unreal, Sin, etc. while being violent
<BR>games, don't try to simulate a real world (economy, society, etc.) as an RPG does.
<BR>Playing those games is like playing capture the flag or paint-ball -- it's a military
<BR>simulation at heart, where the PvP conflict is not based on victimization.
<BR>An RPG, though, is a simulation of a fantasy world. -PvP players
<BR>want adventure -- they want to go into a dungeon, trounce some bad guys they know are
<BR>there, and to make off with some loot. They want to kill Gnolls in the mountains,
<BR>hunt Frost Giants, etc. They don't want to try to do these things and have another
<BR>person come in and spoil it for them. Having half a dozen hacked, over-levelled
<BR>kewldudes jump you just as you and your friends are about to take down that Frost Giant
<BR>you've worked on for twenty minutes completely ruins the experience, and makes you
<BR>feel like you're wasting your time and your money.
<P>&gt; If the system is implemented badly, yes. If it is successful,
<BR>&gt; It's a safe bet you and everyone else who would otherwise have
<BR>&gt; quit will continue playing, and many people who currently do not
<BR>&gt; play because of the PvP switch will join.
<P>True, if implemented well, I'm sure some of us would stay. It would
<BR>depend on how well. But as I said, I don't think there's a single
<BR>system that can't and won't be exploited by people with a lot of time
<BR>on their hands, and the drive to hurt the graphical representation
<BR>of another human being.
<P>&gt; Other than the "not paying for it out of their own
<BR>&gt; pockets" thing, this is erroneous. As said before, the
<BR>&gt; wasteland of thugs, kewldoods, and Mastah Killahs are a direct
<BR>&gt; result of poorly implemented systems. These people exist for one
<BR>&gt; reason and one reason only, because the system REWARDS them for
<BR>&gt; their actions. Either they get to loot you and keep your stuff
<BR>&gt; without consequences, or they are given some kind of
<BR>&gt; "status" reward by chalking up another kill. If the
<BR>&gt; system works in the opposite direction, punishing these twits
<BR>&gt; for their lack of restraint, poor manners, etc. then they will
<BR>&gt; begin to straighten up. Kind of a virtual "grounding"
<BR>&gt; for these juvenile miscreants. When the system ceases to reward
<BR>&gt; abusers and starts to SERIOUSLY punish them - i.e., not just one
<BR>&gt; or two nasty NPCs, but serious punishments, banishment from
<BR>&gt; cities, poor reputation, etc.
<P>As I said above, I don't think there's any way to credibly punish
<BR>players. Look at Diablo -- even though you only get half of a newbie's
<BR>gold when killed, PK's still abound. It's not about being rewarded by
<BR>the system, it's about hurting another person. A lot of the random PK's
<BR>could care less about items or experience -- they want to know they've
<BR>got someone's ear, that they've bettered another person in combat,
<BR>or that they've made someone feel awful. It's about being able to victimize
<BR>another person. And just because it occurs in a videogame, doesn't
<BR>mean it doesn't have a real affect on the aggressor or the victim. As I said,
<BR>no one wants to pay for a service where they're victimized on a regular basis.
<P>&gt; You can serve both, believe it or not.
<P>I agree that you can -- the switch does serve both.
<P>&gt; On a final note, I would like to pose a question. If NPCs can be
<BR>&gt; restricted to the point where you find it acceptable to be
<BR>&gt; killed by them, why don't you believe that PCs could be
<BR>&gt; similarly confined? It's not a matter of "Artificial
<BR>&gt; intelligence." With the proper system, dying to a player
<BR>&gt; would be just as uncommon, just as "fulfulling" and
<BR>&gt; just as "fun" as meeting up with an NPC monster.
<P>As compelling as many of the proposals for PK confinement
<BR>are, I don't think they would succeed where the PvP switch has.
<BR>People are an unpredictable, random element. And the Mastahkillah's
<BR>of the world are as unpredictable and uncooperative as they come.
<BR>Because unlike you or me, they don't care about roleplaying or about
<BR>making the game a good experience for all. They only care about
<BR>making it a masturbatory power fantasy for themselves -- and that's
<BR>the bottom line. I might be wrong here, But I think that no matter how strict the system
<BR>is, they will find a way to victimize people -- if not by killing them, by spouting gibberish
<BR>and insults at random passersby. And because videogames (at least
<BR>American games) are by their nature violent, you'll find these types in
<BR>large numbers. Maybe not as the majority, but as a sizable perecentage
<BR>of the game's population.
<P>However, giving your idea some thought, I've tried to work out a way
<BR>to make PvP viable within a confined system.
<BR>The only scenario I can think of that could possibly work for both sides
<BR>(which I've never seen proposed) is that characters can only PK across
<BR>"good" or "evil" racial types. The normal races: human, elf variants,
<BR>dwarves, etc. would be played by the -PvP types who want to adventure,
<BR>the "evil" races like the Orcs, trolls, ogres, gnolls, etc., would be
<BR>played by the +PvP types. Rather than just have spawning "evil" creatures,
<BR>you could also have spawning adventurers to fight the evil racial types.
<BR>The evil creatures would be banned from good cities, and vice versa, and there
<BR>would be no common tongue between the two groups. In addition, you could
<BR>not kill anyone of your own racial group except in the case of a duel (example:
<BR>a dwarf couldn't kill an elf randomly, but could ask him to duel). This would reduce
<BR>the random element and make PvP fit more logically within a fantasy framework.
<BR>If a group of evil PK's would want to invade a human city, they would have
<BR>to organize an assault -- and the same would go for good adventurers attacking
<BR>say a Gnoll fortress. Only cooperation would make it successful.
<BR>Otherwise, the two groups could meet in battle in the countryside,
<BR>or if no one is around, can fight spawning monsters or adventurers. To insure that
<BR>no one get's MKed, a PC could not engage another PC why they are engaged in combat
<BR>with an NPC.
<P>Still, I don't think this idea would be well received, as it's random PvP, not organized
<BR>PvP that PK's like. In which case, the switch still might be the best solution.

<TD COLSPAN=2><P><STRONG><font face=arial size=2>Message:</STRONG>
<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=70 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; I found your response to my post to be thoughtful and 
&gt; insightful -- presenting the perspective of a responsible 
&gt; PK. I will admit though, considering my experiences on MUDS 
&gt; and UO (brief as that was), I don't believe what you propose 
&gt; could 
&gt; work. 

&gt; If what you say could be properly implemented -- the elimination 
&gt; of random PK -- then perhaps the +PvP and -PvP camps could 
&gt; live together in peace, but as a cynic, I can't help but feel 
&gt; there will be someone out there to exploit PvP no matter how 
&gt; strict the penalty. 
&gt; And also, how stiff a punishment can the game really provide? 
&gt; It's like real life: a 
&gt; sociopathic person, no matter the threat of prison, public 
&gt; censure, 
&gt; etc., will behave sociopathically. Prison, death row, etc. have 
&gt; done 
&gt; little to prevent real people from committing crime. In fact, 
&gt; crime rates have risen. 
&gt; In a fantasy world, where violence -- be it P v NPC or PvP is 
&gt; the norm -- I doubt these types 
&gt; of punishments could work. The question here is how do you 
&gt; create a credible 
&gt; system of punishment? If punished, wouldn't a PK just start a 
&gt; new character? 
&gt; Will being kicked out of the cities stop PK's from flourishing 
&gt; in the countryside? 
&gt; How do you punish a paying customer for &quot;bad&quot; 
&gt; behavior? You can't ban a 
&gt; paying customer who is only doing what the game system allows 
&gt; them to do. 
&gt; That's why I think the switch is the only real solution to the 
&gt; random PK problem. 
&gt; It's a compromise solution, but it's the only one that doesn't 
&gt; completely infringe 
&gt; on the rights of either side (though there's +PvP's and -PvP's 
&gt; who complain that 
&gt; it does, that we still have share the game with each other even 
&gt; when we can't 
&gt; fight oneanother). 

&gt; Ah, here's where I completely disagree. Living in the 
&gt; Washington, D.C. 
&gt; metropolitan area, I exist in a constant state of fear. Walking 
&gt; my dog at 
&gt; 1 in the morning, passing drug dealers in the neighborhood 
&gt; playground (where 
&gt; the kids are afraid to play) is completely unnerving. Why then, 
&gt; would I want that 
&gt; sense of random fear in a videogame, which is primarily an 
&gt; escape, a stress 
&gt; reliever if you will? Quake, Unreal, Sin, etc. while being 
&gt; violent 
&gt; games, don't try to simulate a real world (economy, society, 
&gt; etc.) as an RPG does. 
&gt; Playing those games is like playing capture the flag or 
&gt; paint-ball -- it's a military 
&gt; simulation at heart, where the PvP conflict is not based on 
&gt; victimization. 
&gt; An RPG, though, is a simulation of a fantasy world. -PvP players 
&gt; want adventure -- they want to go into a dungeon, trounce some 
&gt; bad guys they know are 
&gt; there, and to make off with some loot. They want to kill Gnolls 
&gt; in the mountains, 
&gt; hunt Frost Giants, etc. They don't want to try to do these 
&gt; things and have another 
&gt; person come in and spoil it for them. Having half a dozen 
&gt; hacked, over-levelled 
&gt; kewldudes jump you just as you and your friends are about to 
&gt; take down that Frost Giant 
&gt; you've worked on for twenty minutes completely ruins the 
&gt; experience, and makes you 
&gt; feel like you're wasting your time and your money. 

&gt; True, if implemented well, I'm sure some of us would stay. It 
&gt; would 
&gt; depend on how well. But as I said, I don't think there's a 
&gt; single 
&gt; system that can't and won't be exploited by people with a lot of 
&gt; time 
&gt; on their hands, and the drive to hurt the graphical 
&gt; representation 
&gt; of another human being. 

&gt; As I said above, I don't think there's any way to credibly 
&gt; punish 
&gt; players. Look at Diablo -- even though you only get half of a 
&gt; newbie's 
&gt; gold when killed, PK's still abound. It's not about being 
&gt; rewarded by 
&gt; the system, it's about hurting another person. A lot of the 
&gt; random PK's 
&gt; could care less about items or experience -- they want to know 
&gt; they've 
&gt; got someone's ear, that they've bettered another person in 
&gt; combat, 
&gt; or that they've made someone feel awful. It's about being able 
&gt; to victimize 
&gt; another person. And just because it occurs in a videogame, 
&gt; doesn't 
&gt; mean it doesn't have a real affect on the aggressor or the 
&gt; victim. As I said, 
&gt; no one wants to pay for a service where they're victimized on a 
&gt; regular basis. 

&gt; I agree that you can -- the switch does serve both. 

&gt; As compelling as many of the proposals for PK confinement 
&gt; are, I don't think they would succeed where the PvP switch has. 
&gt; People are an unpredictable, random element. And the 
&gt; Mastahkillah's 
&gt; of the world are as unpredictable and uncooperative as they 
&gt; come. 
&gt; Because unlike you or me, they don't care about roleplaying or 
&gt; about 
&gt; making the game a good experience for all. They only care about 
&gt; making it a masturbatory power fantasy for themselves -- and 
&gt; that's 
&gt; the bottom line. I might be wrong here, But I think that no 
&gt; matter how strict the system 
&gt; is, they will find a way to victimize people -- if not by 
&gt; killing them, by spouting gibberish 
&gt; and insults at random passersby. And because videogames (at 
&gt; least 
&gt; American games) are by their nature violent, you'll find these 
&gt; types in 
&gt; large numbers. Maybe not as the majority, but as a sizable 
&gt; perecentage 
&gt; of the game's population. 

&gt; However, giving your idea some thought, I've tried to work out a 
&gt; way 
&gt; to make PvP viable within a confined system. 
&gt; The only scenario I can think of that could possibly work for 
&gt; both sides 
&gt; (which I've never seen proposed) is that characters can only PK 
&gt; across 
&gt; &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; racial types. The normal 
&gt; races: human, elf variants, 
&gt; dwarves, etc. would be played by the -PvP types who want to 
&gt; adventure, 
&gt; the &quot;evil&quot; races like the Orcs, trolls, ogres, gnolls, 
&gt; etc., would be 
&gt; played by the +PvP types. Rather than just have spawning 
&gt; &quot;evil&quot; creatures, 
&gt; you could also have spawning adventurers to fight the evil 
&gt; racial types. 
&gt; The evil creatures would be banned from good cities, and vice 
&gt; versa, and there 
&gt; would be no common tongue between the two groups. In addition, 
&gt; you could 
&gt; not kill anyone of your own racial group except in the case of a 
&gt; duel (example: 
&gt; a dwarf couldn't kill an elf randomly, but could ask him to 
&gt; duel). This would reduce 
&gt; the random element and make PvP fit more logically within a 
&gt; fantasy framework. 
&gt; If a group of evil PK's would want to invade a human city, they 
&gt; would have 
&gt; to organize an assault -- and the same would go for good 
&gt; adventurers attacking 
&gt; say a Gnoll fortress. Only cooperation would make it successful. 
&gt; Otherwise, the two groups could meet in battle in the 
&gt; countryside, 
&gt; or if no one is around, can fight spawning monsters or 
&gt; adventurers. To insure that 
&gt; no one get's MKed, a PC could not engage another PC why they are 
&gt; engaged in combat 
&gt; with an NPC. 

&gt; Still, I don't think this idea would be well received, as it's 
&gt; random PvP, not organized 
&gt; PvP that PK's like. In which case, the switch still might be the 
&gt; best solution.
