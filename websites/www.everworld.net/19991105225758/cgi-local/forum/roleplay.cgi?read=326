<P>*Hearing the barbarians call his name, Fen motions for the sea captain to wait a moment in his explanation of ship use on the open sea. Walking across the deck to where the northmen stand dripping and irate on the pier below, the rogue hunkers down and listens to what Gradnon and Trescar have to say...*

<P>*After, looking about to be sure the dark elf was occupied elsewhere (which he was, stewing in his anger near the bow of the craft), and to be certain the little druid wasn't eavedropping, Fen whispers to his friends : *
<P>"Look, I'm none to excited about this either, boys, but I'm thinkin' it's probably the best way to go. As much as I hate to admit it, that damn bastard is right, the guards'll be down on this place and they're gonna be none to happy with all the corpses." Again glancing about, Fen looks at the two huge men and pauses a moment. "You sure you don't wanna come with? Trust me, your redhead is gone and he's not going to be easy to find, he'll show his ugly mug again only when he wants to and no sooner, and I doubt that'll be anytime in the near future, seein' that half this city wants his head... plus this dark elf don't seem too... stable, if you catch me. It'd be nice to have some familiar faces."
<P>*Staring at the mountain men, Fen measures their looks.*
<P>"Geezum crow, c'mon! There's even a damsiel in distress! ...and why leave in the morning? My hunch is that Crimson'll be in Freeport for a good while yet... either way, big fellas, I'll be back sooner than later, but I gotta go for now. If I don't, I'll have that nasty inkie on my tail as well as the other three quarters of the Freeport guard that are still breathing... good travels to the both of ya."
<P>*With that said, he stands, finds another plank leaning up against the deckhouse, and bridges the gap between the boat and the pier again. Not waiting to see if Gradnon and Trescar board the ship or make their way back towards dry land along the docks, Fen retakes his position beside the sea captain and tells him to continue with his crash course on the manning of vessels on the seven seas...*
