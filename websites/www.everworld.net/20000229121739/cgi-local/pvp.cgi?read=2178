<P>Lots of contention about XP loss on death, or looting different things. I like the loot one item from anywhere. It makes for some REAL loss. Personally I would prefer to lose XP than some of the better items, but everyone seems to hate that idea.

<P>Here's my suggestion to stop the naked spellcaster rampage. Make a spell lootable. That way someone can page through the spellbook and nab that idiot's most powerful spell. That leads to all sorts of problems like a) what if he's slow and doesn't loot right away and the spellcaster reloads and mems (which I think is alright then but he would lose the spell next time he died) or b) actually setting up the spellbook so others could see it and take stuff OUT of it. So its not a great idea developerwise, but I think it would DEFINITELY put a stop to the insta-respawn naked spellcaster problem. Boom, they respawn and they are without their primary attack spell or Root. Now he's about as effective as a Warrior missing his best weapon. Its STILL unfair to fighters because fighter equipment costs SO much more (20th level necromancer spells cost what? 15 plat maybe? A piece of bronzeplatemail or rubicite armor goes anywhere from 50 to 300pp on the openmarket?) but it would greatly remove the naked spellcaster syndrome.
<P>Its not the greatest answer. I still believe XP loss for getting killed is the best way and make sure you Bind in a nice area (there's a luser named Zigen whose a halfling PK who once we find his bind point is a dead man) if you don't want to get chain-killed, or make it a bannable offense to bind point camp (you have enough time between reloads to take several screenshots of you dying again and again). You wouldn't get rid of the bandits or or PvP murderers because they choose their fights well, but you would assure that you'd stop a lot of the naked no-risk spellcaster rampages.
<P>There's no easy answer. I believe looting only from the inventory loses a bit of the tension because you don't really lose anything, there's no pain of death and no real reward for defeating an opponent. Most battle would be rendered honor based and a lot more meaningless. I don't mind this so much because I can do it, but can a majority of the others do it?
<P>I also dislike the race server idea (not too badly), simply because it removes a LOT more of the conflict than I prefer. It would be better if they made it single race teams (Dark Elves cannot kill Dark Elves) but even this I find too binding, it would get rid of those idiotic low level PKers for the most part, but it still wouldn't get rid of the naked spellcasters and it wouldn't help between intra-race conflicts (doesn't it suck to stand there and watch a friend get waxed by someone you can't hit? Now watch it happen even more if you have friends of a different race).
<P>In my little ideal world, I see you after say level 8 or 9 or whatever being able to attack anyone (even those 30th level guys if you are so inclined, it can be done slowly, a group of around 20 level 10-15's got all the way to the ogre captain before getting waxed) and there's a very real punishment based on your level and your killer's level (ie if you are level 10 and a level 8-12 kills you you lose a good chunk of XP or they get a full inventory/backpack/equipped one item loot of you, but if a level 30 walks by and steps on you, you lose only a tiny fraction of XP and they can't loot you, same the other way. If you are level 30 and you get mobbed by like 20 level 12's, you lose nothing except some chunk of XP). I know there's a lot of room for abuse because there are always a few bad eggs (generally more than a few on the Internet or playing these games) that will try to buck the system to screw people over or gain a signficant advantage.
