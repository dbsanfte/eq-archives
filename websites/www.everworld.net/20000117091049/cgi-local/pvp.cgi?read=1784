<P>PvP or AG server? AG= Anything Goes

<P>I was in beta 4 and after playing a bit on the nonPvP servers I moved to Rallos Zek. I was aware of how the server came about and I believed that if people were given the opportunity to control their own behavior and if we had the tools to communicate and identify problem players. During beta this proved to be the case. In those rare instances where someone was being abusive to other players his name soon became known and no one would group with him.
<P>Since release this has been a mixed bag. My primary character is a high elf cleric. One of the ‘self promoting’ UO gangs has taken up residence in Steamfont and were making raids on elves at Crushbone. I was killed in one of these events. No big deal and it was not abusive. It was cheap in that I was attacked when I was low on health and mana and sitting at the time and that it was 3 on 1 but hey… I know that most pks do not want what they say they want (challenge) but a quick kill and LOOT. And do not try to argue otherwise. You know that if you could not loot, you would not PK.
<P>This seemed to bring out the forces in Faydark to put the hurt on all gnomes in Steamfont. In fact, gnomes that were in beta and were friends are harassed now when they come to join us. I am already finding myself having to protect my friends from the kind of killing that happened in UO to dread lords.
<P>Yet, for the most part things seem to be going ok in our corner of the world.
<P>My other experience has been very very different. I started an Erudite enchanter. In Erudin a gang (I would not dignify them by calling it a guild) has started a little reign of terror. Here is their method of killing. They hit you with spells until you are very low on health then melee until you are unconscious. Then they back off… doing a little dance… and wait until you have regained consciousness… then knock you unconscious again… repeat until bored then render the killing blow. They also know just exactly how far they have to be to hit you with an offensive spell when you are standing right next to the guards.
<P>What you hear in Tox is continual shouts by these players and the victims. The other people are grim and simply do not talk at all. Anyone starting a character in Erudin on Rallos Zek must have a terrible view of how EQ works. Most are leaving Erudin but there is no relief for an Erudite in Qeynos. Again… when another player has killed me it was an Erudite.
<P>Of course the shouts one hears are those who say it is a PK server and others trying to reason and say that PvP does not mean this kind of abusive behavior. However, it seems to be to no avail as this gang seems intent on bringing this kind of atmosphere to the entire server almost as if they see it a point of principle that they should be able to be as vile as they wish.
<P>So my question to the people who post here is this… is there a boundary to player killing that pushes it into the area of unacceptable behavior? Is this an either only situation? I certainly do not have the answer. But I know what I wish…
