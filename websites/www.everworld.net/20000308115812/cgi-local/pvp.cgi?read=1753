<P>I have been trying to get an idea that I think could improve roleplaying in Norrath. I have tried the PVP server but I do not think a total on or off method is good for most people and I did not care to get killed by a creature and then looted by people waiting....so I have come up with another idea maybe for a secondary PvP server that I think a lot more people would play because it would also add a ton of social interaction too :)

<P>First a quick overview of what brought me to this idea. I was a beta 4 tester and I loved the game was awesome and then at the end of beta people started posting about the race marches on Freeport and defending Freeport and I realized that the game was still focused on us vs. the computer AI....granted we have to cooperate together but still the limitations that puts on the experience is enormous. I started thinking how great a racewar would be but also realized in the present form of all or nothing PVP that it was merely a great big parade. I started thinking of ideas to add this and bring more roleplaying to the forefront of the game itself and this is what I have devised. Mind you it is merely a rough draft and needs work plus I dont know how some of it could be implemented on your end.
<BR>I would like to try some sort of Diplomacy system. Every race would have its own gov't: some like the trolls, ogres, and darkelves decided by strength or cunning....and the good races by election or elders or methods like that...maybe each race could have a particular method and have one race that is neutral and one that can flipflop depending on the leaders. All the gov'ts would be run by players....some as counsel groups some as dictators....and all PVP status between races would be decided by diplomacy...in other words sometimes dark elves and trolls and ogres would have to be in non war status because even they know they cant win and when things shift then it could change....due to people stealing artifacts from their enemies race or a diplomat being slain etc...i think you would move away from open PVP this way but make it possible to ROLEPLAY characters!!!!!
<BR>Please think on this and if I could get some sort of response as too whether this is possible or maybe you would like to discuss it further. I really think you have an awesome game here and dont want to see it just end up a great game of people vs. computer AI.
<BR>One last note I have played many many rpgs and online rpgs and have never played a PKer and I am not about to start now but I do remember my days on various MUDs and Meridian 59 when we had wars or were bound and determined to hunt down a fugitive that was hurting people....I tried Rallos Zek but the all or nothing method of PVP I am not real fond of....still a few non roleplay kewl doods determined to just sack people all over all the time.
<BR>I believe being able to check the newest status of your races relations as u log on should be enuff you know then who to avoid and who not too also. You could also institute like a limit of the first 3 levels never can be killed just so newbies have a chance to learn before it all happens. I really believe that if you think about it to try a server set up like this would be incredible!!! And I know a lot of people I have broached this too that would love to see this implemented :)
<BR>Thanks and please let me know what you think....
