<P>Greetings and evil upon you,

<P>Can anyone verify why the [GM] God powerful being destroyed the Dark Elf War Party with his army of animals? For those not aware, a large party of drow (and a troll or two) was raised by myself just the eve before. As we amassed at the East Commons to muster together, a huge human like being approached with a wolf and lioness in tow.
<P>Without warning he and his beasts attacked, a male lion and kodiac bear joining his ranks within seconds. Fought as we might, I remember looking up from the lioness that we battled and saw the human striking down our most powerful warriors with single strokes of his fist. Dozens of us fell and alas even my friend Madason died at the claws of the lioness beast we fought.
<P>Soon our war party lay in tatters, the bodies of troll and drow alike littering the field. I was alone, the lioness I fought still tearing at me though she was as close to death as I. Turning in a fit of desperate anger, I ran toward the human as he strolled from his carnage and slashed him with my mace. With a flick of his wrist, my spirit escaped and I too left the field of battle.
<P>Shortly after, we regrouped to gather our lost possessions, looted as we were then. Most of our force left, the urge to fight against such odd's leaving them with thoughts of self interest (very drow like I might add).
<P>Soon, our force of perhaps 12 remaining (including Homy the Troll) moved toward Freeport, our original intent. The carnage we met upon the humans we found there was glorious, I don't know how many fell but I can tell you that for some time they did not fare well against us and our casualties were light.
<P>Within a short time, they began to organize better, realizing the ominious threat we made to their skins. Several of the drow fell as we met their newly organized wave but in the end Madason, Homy and others were able to escape with their lives and the trophy of human blood upon their hands.
<P>Soon, we will amass again, but not until I learn more of the fate delegated upon our army by the Human at the pass and his animal minions.
