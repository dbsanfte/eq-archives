<P>Ok folks, heres my 2 cents on the race war server:

<P>Race wars, first of all, have got to be the greatest thing to come out of EQ. The endless monotony of the non warfare based servers is brutal, and the pure chaos on the abyss--- er-- rallos zek server is equally brutal. Race wars give the killing a purpose for everyone... hell even if you are of the frag mentality the race war server works for you... just dont play a "good" race =P. There are some issues on how the server will develop which need to be looked at.
<P>first the pure race war scenario (eg the humanoids, the elves, the evil, and the short... blah blah)
<P>This seems wonderful in that certain races already have their homelands in separate regions, and enemy races can more or less lay seige to an entire zone. This could be fun, at least until enemy races start camping on the zone borders waiting for those people with fast computers to zone on in and get fragged by the opposing faction. There is also another problem... the half elven race has no homeland... and it falls under the category of the elves.... would its starting point be restricted to Kelethin? If this were the case there would be a monstrous resource burden placed on the greater feydark region... such a huge burden would hinder the initial character bulk created there to such a degree that an invading army from freeport would easily crush them... freeport humans would simply level faster because of less competition for those nasty bats and spiderlings =P.
<BR>Speak also of invasion potential... if ALL these races are at war with each other, then the races which do not control port cities will never even SEE races on other continents. So the elves would be at war with trolls and dark elves which to them simply do not in fact exist. No dark elf would be able to cross the human town to get to kaladim, and no dwarf or elf would be able to land in freeport to wage war on neriak or grobb.
<BR>race wars are attractive in that there is a purpose to each fight... but this model is unattractive because of a massive impossibility of some scenarios occurring until well over 30th level (when you can get some druid to transport you onto another continent... at least if you are an elf or human. the evils are still screwed)
<P>the diety war combination.
<P>This model is unattractive in that some races who would be natural enemies and worship the same god would not be able to attack each other... at least some say. While this is a nice argument against this model its simply not the case. Imagine if you will a human worshipper of innorruk runs across a dark elf shadowknight. Now the human says "hail brother!" Dark elf has 3 options. One is to join in universal brotherly hatred and crush all opposing factions. Another is to laugh silently at this humans nieve notions of brotherhood and use this human as a porter for a while while deciding how best to skewer him and take his belongings. The last is to show him the true meaning of hate and skewer him on the spot, and be damned with his false worship of innorruk... no follower of innorruk has a brother! These are all possible... depending on how they handle the gods behavior.
<BR>ANother example would be worshippers of solusek ro. These can be virtually any race.... perhaps they would set aside their differences to help the cause of ro (anyone remember Ortallius the Orc and the Erudite merchant in SRo? Perfect example)
<BR>This model allows for flexibility, so that there is limited race combinations, and groupings can be determined by gods rather than by race. Certain gods naturally will tolerate other believers (so that all evils can work together) and all gods will tolerate agnostics--- to a point. This brings the existing diety system in Everquest into actual gameplay, and not only will make for interesting groups and reasons for battle, but quests can be generated and set forth by the gods themselves for their followers to complete.
<P>Which option is more attractive i leave to your own preference. The race war is simple, and its simplicity is its best and worst feature. The diety war is complicated, but then again, we are playing a computer game, not a nintendo. We should be able to handle a little advanced thought.
