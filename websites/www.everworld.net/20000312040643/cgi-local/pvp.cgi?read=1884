<P>Lanfate,

<P>Despair not. Luckily the makers of EverQuest were wise enough to put in level restrictions on PVP to prevent idiot freaks like Xakterr from trying to rule the world with their moron mentality. He is 25 and still lives with his parents, obviously filling him with an intense desire to try to simulate real life happiness, success, and power by making himself out to be some kind of awesome gamer who rules over everyone's life because he's so "powerful." What everyone but him realizes, though, is that the fact that he has power to use only means that he has a seriously degenerated social life and must compensate for his failure to find anything useful to do in real life by playing EverQuest 18 hours a day. These people think people look up to them or admire them for their "ability" to achieve such a high level. Hell, even Verant congratulates the first person to reach the maximum level, simply marking him as the person with the greatest desire to escape reality or the greatest lack of anything constructive to put his efforts into.
<P>I am all for gaming, and in fact I do a great deal of it myself, but these people who think they draw some kind of admiration by being "powerful" are only fooling themselves; I rarely sacrifice my social life for EverQuest; these people HAVE not social life to sacrifice. It is a sad state of affairs and I can offer you only this advice: Avoid them completely, don't even bother having conversations with them because they will only say things like "I am VERY powerful and I will now make your life a living hell," or things of the sort. Also, rest assured in the fact that they seem to overlook, now that they have spent 20 hours a day playing, they have successfully leveled out of range of 97% of the people in the game, thus removing their ability to force anyone to do anything, because they can only PVP fellow freaks who happen to play almost as much and be within 4 levels. So, in essence, you are IMMUNE to these idiots until level 46. Sure, they will get to 50 first, but then they will sit there for weeks waiting for everyone to catch up while they gather platinum and dust. Oh, well. Like I said, humor their teenage mentalities. If they don't grow up, then feel comforted in the fact that some day their parent's will stop letting them live in the basement and they will have to go out and get some shit job at Taco Bell and won't be able to afford their own computer and will thus be removed from the world of internet gaming forever.
<P>
