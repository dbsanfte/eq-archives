<P>

<BR>The following assumes that Verant is willing to make some PvP specific changes to the code base in order to facilitate PvP combat in Everquest. If that assumption is invalid, it is my opinion that the current system will not prove viable.
<P>First the problems:
<P>#1 Level based PvE system is too restrictive in determining attack, damage, and spell resistance for PvP combat.
<P>#2 It is too difficult if not impossible to kill another player given the ease with which players can zone, camp and log out, or use SotW type spells to escape.
<P>#3 Grouping problems arise in PvP situations that must be remedied so group combat can go forward.
<P>Now some solutions:
<P>#1 Have the combat system determine whether a player is engaged in a PvE combat or a PvP combat. If it is a PvP combat then use a modified set of algorithms for determining Attack, Damage, and Spell Resistance. These algorithms should allow players within +/-4 levels to have a reasonable chance of hitting, damaging, and effecting with spells their opponents.
<BR>Where the code currently checks for twinking and limits it for PvE this should be reduced or eliminated in the PvP environment. Examples of this are characters with the same Attack and AC numbers who are a few levels apart having drastically different chances of hitting and damaging one another. Also weapons that do less than their rated damage solely based on the characters level. Spell resistance is also heavily slanted towards character level, and this impact needs to be lessened.
<P>#2 Fatigue should play an even greater role in PvP combats. When a player goes below 3 bubbles they should begin to move slower. At 2 bubbles remaining add an additional slow down and begin scaling that slow down in a linear fashion as 0 health is approached. At 1 bubble all SotW type spells should be ineffective or have a minimal effect. Add a "Sprint" skill that when used causes SotW to be in effect for a short duration (15 to 20 seconds) and uses fatigue. Fighters should have a much greater Sprint proficiency than other classes (especialy those that get SotW spells). The higher the character's stamina the longer the Sprint should last and the hit to stamina should be slightly lesssened, to make this primarily a fighter skill.
<P>#3 For PvP characters to group, all characters in the party should be within two levels of the highest level character plus one level for every 10 levels the highest character has. A 15th level top character could have in his group any characters 12th level or higher. Such a group can attack any other group that consists of at least 2/3 members within this range. I call this the group attack rating (GAR). The 15th character has a GAR of 12 to 18, so groups with 2/3 members in that range could be attacked. Again take the highest level character and divide by 10 then add 2 to get the offset +/- to his level.
<BR>When an individual or a group attacks another group, then a group combat flag is set and everyone in the two groups is tracked as being in combat with one another. Individuals that meet the normal +/-4 level requirements can engage group members, but by attacking a grouped player they are attacking the entire group and can then be attacked by all members of that group.
<BR>When a player forms a group they should have to give it a name (this is part of the existing interface). It should be clear to anyone attempting to attack a member of a group that they are part of a group and which group they are part of.
<P>Finally add a /gduel function that allows one group to challenge another outside of the normal GAR or individual level restrictions. A /duel or /gduel challenge should only last for 60 seconds after which time if not accepted it times out. Only members in the group at the time the /gduel was issued will be flagged as combatants to both groups when the duel is accepted. Issuing a /gduel will also send the list of names of the characters in the challenge group along with their levels (no anonymous /gduel).
<P>If these three areas are addressed I feel that Everquest can have a workable PvP system worthy of support by the PvP community. None of these changes are designed to impact the PvE environment or combat system in any way. They could and should be implemented to the main code base as opposed to being added for the PvP server alone.
