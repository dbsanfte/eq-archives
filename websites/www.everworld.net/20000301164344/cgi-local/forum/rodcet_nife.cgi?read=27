<P>I was recently ripped off for everything I had by a couple of Dark Elves who claim to be 'roleplaying'. KENEALAN & SARAGOTH . I took a risk, and lost, by giving one of them consent to loot my corps on the bridge in Nektulos, where I couldn't get back to it due to the guards. They made a grand production of the incident by 'shouting' that I shouldn't have trusted a 'roleplaying' Dark Elf...after they stole my stuff. They bolth then camped and were gone. Kenealan dosn't realize it, but I saw him and he dose not make it known that he is a 'roleplayer' by using the purple lettering for his name. He also dosn't communicate as if he was in character, but instead talks normally. Also, these two cowards are not pvp...so they are truly immune to repercussions by the 'good' players in the game for actions such as these.

<BR>Why anyone would want to be a jerk like this is beyond me. I guess it must have somthing to do with their self-worth in the real world.
<BR>I'm a role-playing player and really enjoy it when others roleplay aswell. However I feel this is taking the concept and twisting it badly.
<BR>Concidering the time a person has to spend playing this game...I feel this sort of behavior takes away from the fun to be had.
<BR>These two Dark Elves should be avoided by anyone who enjoys the true spirit of the game. When I go PVP, they will probley still be hiding behind the constraints of the game! If a player wants to act as they do, go PVP now and save us the rationalizing of your cowardly actions! JAG
