<P>> First and foremost, there is a PvP community. It is not made up

<BR>&gt; entirely of k00l d00dz as you like to put it,
<P>never said it was...but it is the k3wLd00ds who are problematic
<P>and it is
<BR>&gt; certainly larger than the 10% you mention. Several months ago
<BR>&gt; Stratics ran a survey on PvP on UO players, asking which were
<BR>&gt; interested in PvP/PK and which were against it. A majority
<BR>&gt; (that's over 50% for those not mathematically gifted), were
<BR>&gt; interested in PvP and participated in PvP on a regular basis.
<BR>&gt; Somewhere between 20% to 25% fell into the category of PK,
<BR>&gt; either being full time PKs or having no inhibitions about
<BR>&gt; killing other players.
<P>several month ago is quite a while AFTER i surmise that all the legitimate players had been driven out of ExploitOnline......i'm surprised they only found 50%
<P>&gt; Many of the facts you mentioned are true however. Verant did
<BR>&gt; design Everquest to be a PvE game, and yes PvP was added as more
<BR>&gt; of an afterthough. Most of us in the PvP community realize this
<BR>&gt; and have for quite some time now.
<P>so why then are you so angry when i represent a more Verant-like opinion on this board?
<P>Even so, Brad has stated that
<BR>&gt; he would address PvP issues in Phase IV and balancing the PvP
<BR>&gt; game insofar as it does not compromise the PvE balance.
<P>it would be very difficult to effect one without effecting the other....true balance is fragile indeed
<P>Whether
<BR>&gt; this will happen or not I cannot say. Given that the dev team is
<BR>&gt; currently focusing on fixing bugs for the release I don't expect
<BR>&gt; much to be done in the way of correcting PvP problems, but I am
<BR>&gt; not ready to give up hope on this game yet and write it off.
<P>&gt; I'm always amazed at the lack of intellect shown by some
<BR>&gt; "role players" in their blind flaming of PvP issues
<BR>&gt; and players.
<P>the only people i have ever said anyhting nasty about is Mr. k3wLd00d HaXoR69......are you he?.......your second mistake here is in calling me a roleplayer..if you took the time to read what someone's saying before responding to it it should have been pretty obvious that i'm pro PvP
<P>As a group that tends to idealize it's role in the
<BR>&gt; online comminity as being better than the masses, I would expect
<BR>&gt; more. Th ePvP community as a whole does not want to force it's
<BR>&gt; system onto the RP community. The changes we are asking for are
<BR>&gt; specific to PvP, and at least as far as my suggestions go,
<BR>&gt; stipulate that the current PvE balance be left as-is. The truth
<BR>&gt; of the matter is that many RPers just can't stand the idea of
<BR>&gt; their ideal world being overrun by happy PvP players who would
<BR>&gt; not share their RPing fervor.
<P>a world overrun by k3wLd00d HaXoR69 is exactly what UO was....a world i don't want to live in...the problem is not the existence of a different type of player, the problem is the player who's pleasure in the game is derived exclusively from destroying someone else's ability to enjoy the game
<P>The RPers dread the thought that
<BR>&gt; Everquest could be an interesting PvP experience, and that would
<BR>&gt; in turn draw thousands of more players to the servers who would
<BR>&gt; just as soon hack you down without even the pleasantries of
<BR>&gt; exchanging a "have at thee!"
<P>if you're trying to fault me for not liking the idea of a world populated entirely by serial killers then i guess i'm guilty
<P>&gt; Fortunately Everquest features a PvP switch which preserves our
<BR>&gt; styles of game play and prevents those who don't want to partake
<BR>&gt; in PvP from becoming victims of it.
<P>which is all well and good unless the PvP lobby is effective (unlikely tho that is) in convincing someone on the dev team that restrictions on PvP should be laxed.....i'm hear to argue against that, am i not entitled an opinion?
<P>Verant has also been so kind
<BR>&gt; as to offer an exclusive PvP server, yet another method of
<BR>&gt; seperating the two styles of gaming.
<P>in my opinion this was an effort to isolate you from legitimate players....i ahve no problem with people i'll never have to play with, enjoy!....my issue with the PvP server is that, being pro PvP and anti S3RiaLkiLLa, i have to lose my abilty to play on the PvP server because it will be overrun (your word) by your type of player....the problem with that is that your type of player has a tendency to bring the rest of population to your level (in order to remain competitve in a world full of assholes, i, myself, must become an asshole)
<P>What remains now is to
<BR>&gt; modify the system as much as is feasable to support PvP so that
<BR>&gt; players who choose to do so can enjoy that part of the game. To
<BR>&gt; that end, we the PvP community kindly ask you to butt out of our
<BR>&gt; business. "Pray thee sir, take thine flames
<BR>&gt; elsewhere!"
<P>i'm pro PvP, it IS my business
