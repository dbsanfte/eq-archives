<P>As far as the Paladin, Paladins are supposed to be good. Not just good but insanely good. A Paladin killing another Paladin because it happens to be the same race that someone who raped his mother was.....well that just doesn’t make much sense. (hell he should be happy that elf raped his mother...after all he would have never been born otherwise...was a bit off subject but oh well ;pp) I doubt that Paladin would find himself in favor with his god for long and most likely from an RP standpoint would fall from his Paladin status. Paladins are supposed to be so selfless it’s sickening. Revenge, especially against another Paladin is anything but selfless. That Paladin would find that he is merely a warrior and not a Paladin after all.

<P>I agree that deity wars would be better than pure race wars. Gods of war, hate, and other types of gods that thrive on mortal grief could be handled differently than gods who thrive on goodness. In those cases a dwarf might very well kill a troll who worships the same deity.
<P>&gt; Think about this. Would a would a dwarf warrior and a troll
<BR>&gt; warrior who worshipped the same god get along? No. The Dwarf
<BR>&gt; warrior would think it was his duty to rid the world of Trolls.
<BR>&gt; And well a Troll would see a nice dinner. But what I am getting
<BR>&gt; at is just cause they worship the same race doesn't mean they
<BR>&gt; believe others have a right to. A Half elf Paladin might hate
<BR>&gt; Humans. Maybe his elf mother got raped by a human. Now to him a
<BR>&gt; human would not have the right to worship the same god as him,
<BR>&gt; and it would be a great thing to have them all wiped from the
<BR>&gt; earth. Of course I see a problem here. Where do half elf
<BR>&gt; paladins start off in life? Freeport or Qeynos. Going to be
<BR>&gt; tough for some half elf that start off in humans city's to get
<BR>&gt; much done. I am hoping Verant thinks about this and changes it
<BR>&gt; some for this server.
