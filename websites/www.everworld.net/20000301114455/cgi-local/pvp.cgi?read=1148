</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> Thank you for all the responses. This board is by a fair amount

<BR>&gt; the best I have found and I have done a fair amount of
<BR>&gt; searching.
<P>&gt; When I said Dark Elves were the only evil rouge class, I mean it
<BR>&gt; as in Trolls, D-elves and Ogers are the only three
<BR>&gt; "evil" races and hence the only three races that can
<BR>&gt; really interact closely.
<P>&gt; I am being drafted into an elite group of PvP'rs and I am
<BR>&gt; currently doing my homework on EQ. My problem is that
<BR>&gt; the guild is to be 'evil' and to be evil we are all de, trolls
<BR>&gt; and ogers. If I am an 'evil' halfling I can't be in the guild
<BR>&gt; simply because I will be killed in the evil cities. We have our
<BR>&gt; mix of things but are lacking in the rogue department.
<BR>&gt; I happen to be very skilled at playing assassins, so the task is
<BR>&gt; upto me to make one work successfuly in PvP guildwar
<BR>&gt; type events. It may be a worthy point of fact that the evil
<BR>&gt; races do not have a race that is sutable for paying assassins.
<BR>&gt; I won't hold my breath though.
<P>&gt; Here are some questions for you guys that will help me decide
<BR>&gt; weather or not they are viable as a PvP class...
<P>&gt; A)I hear at high leavels BS does in the tripple digets in
<BR>&gt; dammage is this true?
<P>yes that is true (of course depending on skill and weapon)
<P>&gt; B) Is that enough to kill the relatively low hps of a magician
<BR>&gt; or necro?
<P>Nope, as i stated in my post afore, no one shot kills - not even close.. i would say about 1/2(against a wakling mage) at the most. (just guessing)
<P>&gt; C) Can you hide anytrime you like, is there a delay, do you have
<BR>&gt; to break line of sight?
<P>Hiding is instant, no line of sight or anything like that is taken into consideration and you can do it anytime you want. HOWEVER: You do not know if you are successful (another must tell you if you went invis). You cannot move and if someone has you already targeted, they still can hit you with either a) weapons if they are close enough and facing the right direction, b) spells. Monsters will still see you if they have you targeted and hit you w/o a prob.
<P>&gt; D) Does sneak make you vurtualy invisible when successfuly
<BR>&gt; working?
<P>There are footstep sounds in EQ. Other players just wont hear you, even though they still can see you if you walk into their line of sight. Monsters on the other hand have a chance per 'tick' (no clue how often a second) to "see" you while sneaking. The higher level your sneak skill, the faster you sneak (level 18 rogue sneaks faster than a walk, but not even close to a run). Henceforth, the faster you sneak by, the less time they have to see you. I don't know if the skill comes into the effect for their 'chance' of seeing you, but i heard from one high level rogue that it doesn't.
<P>&gt; E) Do Rogues get Dwield?
<P>Rouges are, next to fighters, the only other pure melee class (that wields weapons). They get both dual wield and second attack. (A rogue buffed with 'quickness' and 2 quick weapons hits 'alot'. Seen a lev 18 rogue do 5-6 hits while the monster did 1. Didn't help though the monster still did more damage in that one hit :P)
<P>&gt; F) Are the rogues Hps (with DE stanima) at high levels enough to
<BR>&gt; survive a couple large radious damage spells?
<P>Well depends on your stamina score. But on an average rogue the hp will be a little less than a cleric, but more than the pure casting classes.
<P>&gt; I have a lot more questions, but I wont't get too carried away
<BR>&gt; };>
<P>Sure, no problem at all, feel free to email me if you want more info.
<P>&gt; Any info is apreciated, thank you...
<BR>&gt; The Depraved One.
