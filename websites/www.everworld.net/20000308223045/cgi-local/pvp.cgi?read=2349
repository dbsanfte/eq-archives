<P>OK. They fixed the guild stuff...Halllaluuuyah! Then they go off and fool with damage? EEK! Bottom line they just can't seem to come up with a formula to make the PvP work well, basically because of the huge power discrepancy in the game via the level system. Well, let me help:

<P>First off, reducing the damage levels of spells is rediculous. If a 30th level warrior faced off against a 30th level wizard and the warrior just sat there relaxing the wizzie could not prolly get him to half damage before spending their entire mana reserves. Is this balance? Making it IMPOSSIBLE for one class to kill another? Imagine a wizzie against a druid or a cleric? ;p 1000 hps plus another 2000 healing....against 60% damage. Forget it. If you are a wizzie you now limited to OP pking ONLY if you foe is VERY close to death....head on PVP dueling ect is out of the question now.
<P>Balance must allow for each class to defeat any other class given the type of powers they have and the play style of the person using the given class. A cleric for example is not gonna be a great killer, but they are NOT supposed to be great killers! SHould it be impossible for them to kill? No....but we must make it a unique thing.
<P>Melee classes have whined since day one that they are underpowered in PvP. This is NOT true. I would like one 30+ here that could defeat a warrior type NPC in a 1 v 1 that is exactly your level given he is as fast as you are to raise their hand. No one? There is no one that can do it to be sure.
<P>Does anyone wonder why melee classes get smoked by magic using classes in PvP (before the stupid patch) but melee NPCs are a pain inthe arse ( i am not talking about NPC bards that don't use their spells either)? It is because the NPCs track and follow you everywhere you go...and it is impossible to outrun them.
<P>Here is the solution then. Institute and AUTO Attack/Follow function that turns a warrior type into an NPC who auto follows their target and attacks them when implemented! GOOD luck to a wizzie who hides behind a tree casting on warrior then! The PC warrior will come on him just like an NPC would...an THEN we have a fight!! RUN wizzie run! Dodge around trees...shadow step...it does NO good! Because your freagin victim will find you JUST like a damn NPC would.
<P>This would basically create the same balance among players as it does among NPC fighting.
<P>One other thing though that prolly should be addressed. DOes anyone wonder how come NPC's hit so dman much harder than PC's? I always though it was funny fighting a 30 level wizzie who could punch for 60 or 70 points hehe. WOnder why we can't do that to? I guess my punching skill is to low ;p
