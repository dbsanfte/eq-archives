<P>First of all, let me say that I tried, once, running a character on Rallos Zek just to see how long it would be before I was pointlessly and randomly killed (almost as soon as I made it out of Grobb, that is). I just can't see PK without RP reasons at this point. So I'd like to ask a question, and then make a suggestion -

<P>Question - Wouldn't it be much better to play a first person shooter if all you really want to do is kill other players for no reason other than that you can?
<P>Suggestion - control PK'ing of lower level characters by experience LOSS on the WINNER! The difference in level should determine the amount of loss. You would still get no experience, nor lose any, for killing a character of higher level. If the /duel command is used between the players, making it voluntary on both parts, there would be no experience loss. Also, you would only get the experience loss if you start the fight. If this didn't do enough to control random and pointless attacks, Verant could also change things so that you lose experience when you kill someone of higher level as well, once again as long as you initiated the combat, and the /duel command was not used.
<P>Also, make it so you cannot loot from a character that is "green" to you! (Ok, that's two suggestions.)
<P>The point of this is to make players only PK when there is a good reason to do so, other than "Oh cool that guy's hurt bad!" I would like to have a character or two on Rallos Zek, because I do feel that it would be more realistic to risk these attacks - however I don't play this game just to be a target for those with no interest in RP.

<P>P.S. - Feel free to flame this if it makes you happy - I'm quite capable of ignoring them. Thanks.
