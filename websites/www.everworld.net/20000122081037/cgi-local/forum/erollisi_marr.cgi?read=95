<P>I am no longer a monk, though I did play one up to 9th or so....but I would base my knowledge more off of my traveling companions anyways. (sometimes as many as 3 monks in my party, that's right, monks worship shaman. ;)

<P>First off, ditch the leather, go for mesh armour from guk, I think the ac might be a little less, but the weight is a LOT less and will more than make up for it and you can take a party in at your skill and do reasonably well...but one word to the wise, you'll need a few casters because the frogloks run like hell and when they come back they come back with half the dungeon and it's not a pretty sight. Guk, if adventured poorly is like waiting in a subway tunnel to catch a ride. Try to pick up someone with some experience there. Also in Guk, as you level increases (perhaps around 19 or 20) you can easily 'camp' the Squire, he is a semi-named frog that occasionally drops the collar of undead protection, a nice, lightweight neck piece that offers decent armour and helps you ward off disease and poison.
<BR>You'll obviously want to upgrade your headband, belt, rings, and earrings as you go up in skill and can afford/find better stuff. I'm not sure which stuff exactly, but search around.
<BR>I'm not sure what the stats are on the bracers of battle, but now I know who's been hoarding them. ;) You might want to try to sell them in GFay and pick up something else....as the warlord is a pretty damn rare spawn, you can easily get 50 platinum for each of them (that's what I was willing to spend, and I don't usually spend exorborant amounts of coin on items....In the end, I bought the mace itself from druid for 90 platinum as at 21st I grew tired of healing the same people over and over occasionally getting a tiny fraction of experience from a green legionnaire)....Anyways, with 100 or so platinum you be able to find a decent set of bracers (that is unless the BoB are excellent in their own right) right.
<P>Just bear in mind that your worst enemy is weight, anything over twenty encumberance starts drastically affecting your ac, so generally those heave, ac gifting items just aren't worth the time.
<P>I'm not sure I helped you much, but perhaps I helped someone out there.
