<P>Off to the side a young man chuckled softly. Unmoved by the display before him, he turns. His robe, adorned with the symbols of Innoruuk, flutters softly as he glances at his companion.

<P>"We have have outgrown our father and creator he says?" The priest chuckles again and the thought. "Tell me," he asks the woman next to him, "How can a creation outgrow it's creator? Innoruuk is our father, that is true. But it is not a father as your father is a father. He is a god, our creator, we are but mortals. As our creator and our god, he gives us the breath of life. When you are slain in the forest, is it you that returns you to the earth with a new body and new life? No! You have not the power to do that. Innoruuk, in his great mercy, has given you life anew. How then can he say 'we have outgrown him?'
<P>The priest shakes his head and smiles again, "Our contact with other races is a step backwards. Innoruuk brought us out of that very thing, this love and compasion that keeps them from completing the task they are called to do. Innoruuk came and cleansed us of that. He brought us to this new and better place. We have grown strong, we are feared and live free. Now these foolish youths, highly intelegent, full of power, but lacking in wisdom seek to bring us back to the ways we have left behind. I pray they will see the errors of their ways before it is too late for us all."
<P>As he and his companion he back into Neriak he continues, "For all he said of leaving Innoruuk behind he certainly did display Innoruuk's ways." He smiles as he continues, "Using Innoruuk's minions to do his work, and killing in the process," the smile grows. "Innoruuk must truly be proud of that one. He is well on his way down the path of hate. For only one who truly hates is capable of killing."
<P>"Come now, or I will be late for my studies."
