</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#F4D99F FACE=arial>
<P>Here are a few more deaths I've had recently.

<P>I was hunting for bone chips on my necromancer and using Detect Undead in Feerot. After killing nine or ten skeletons, I finally cast the spell one last time and ran in the direction of the spell. I had forgotten to look for a skeleton being targetted and ran straight into a Spectre. It was a very short battle.
<P>While in Lake Rathetear, I was swimming towards Southern Karana. Several orcs jumped off the shore which con'ed blue to me, but were wacking me fairly relentlessly. I cast Shadow Step to get away and found myself on the bottom of the lake (it's extremely deep). Luckily, I was far enough from the orcs, unluckily I drowned.
<P>While admiring a train of a single cyclops and thinking to myself, man, those look sooo cool, he changed target on me and decided to whoop my little elfin rear. I was one step from the zone boundry.
<P>I was wondering if lava hurts you in lavastorm... I think you know where this one is leading.
<P>I went to peek down the well in Befallen to see how far down it goes and slipped... (btw- it is a long drop to level three...) I lived, but was promptly killed by ghouls, ice boned skeletons, and greater skeletons.
<P>I went back to the pit invisible and tried to get my stuff. How was I supposed to know looting your corpse makes you visible? I never made this mistake again.
<P>I accidentally clicked on my invisibility spell while standing infront of hostile guards.
<P>I challenged a friend to a duel infront of the Nektolus guards. After the first spell, I found I was sorely defeated in one round.
<P>I fell off the bridge in Infected Paw and didn't hit water. *splat*
<P>I walked around the edge of the bridge in Upper Guk and fell infront of a Froglok Tuk Knight which proceeded to bring down two more knights, a sentry, and a shaman. Damn those suckers swim fast...
<P>I zoned, cast invisibility, and walked by a Sand Giant in Oasis. I sure wish that spell would blink when it's about to run out.
<P><b>And finally, the cruelest deaths I've caused:</b>
<BR>I was chasing a fleeing Gnoll in Black Burrow while I had Spirit of the Wolf on. I killed him but proceeded to get five Gnoll Elite Guards, a Commander, and ten Gnoll Warriors on me. I jumped off the bridge into the water below so they had to go the long way around. I quickly ran upstairs to the zone and had an extremely large lead. Standing around me are about fifteen level 6-7 characters. When the train made it to me, I zoned. Only eight players made it out.
<P>As the train went back downstairs, it latched on to the higher level players. Over twenty Gnolls trained back upstairs. Half the dungeon fled out to Qeynos hills. There were so many people in the entrance to the dungeon that nobody could move.
<P>I counted over twelve new corpses when I went back in once the entrance cleared out.
<P>Have fun!
