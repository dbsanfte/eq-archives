<P>I'm not going to call you "stupid" or "idiotic" because you obviously are not. Your post was well written, but I'm afraid, completely off the mark and UNBELIEVABLY short sighted. May I ask you this? WHY do you think Sony had such a hard time deciding if there would even BE a PvP server? I can answer that for you if you're a bit confused. The answer is this: Because of people who THINK like you do!

<P>Let me preface my comments with this. I WILL play on the PvP server simply because I still feel the pros outweigh the cons, but I must admit, it's getting tougher and tougher to make that statement because of people like you and your "friends" running around.
<P>My friend, there are OTHER games out there for people with your thoughts to play! Now listen, I completely understand that there are MANY schools of thought out there, but we all have to keep ONE important thing in mind! This is a ROLE PLAYING GAME! It means, PLAY A ROLE! If that's not what you want to do, please find a game that is more condusive to your playing style! I want to play a game, a ROLE playing game, where it is as REALISTIC as it possibly can! Thus, I play on the PvP server for the REALISM that comes from NEVER knowing where your next attacker is going to come from! Will it be from that nasty gnoll just around the corner in BB? Or is it when I get off the patroled paths in the darker corners of Qeynos? I LOVE THIS! But I'm afraid it will one day be taken away from me by people who are concerned about one thing: Their OWN enjoyment at the complete and utter cost of all others!
<P>Listen, I'm not some wierdo who cofuses his games with reality, but I do like to bring some reality into the games I play. I try and play them REALISTICALLY! Nine times out of ten (and I admit, I sometimes fail at this) before I commit a "hostile" action, I ask myself, "If this were reality, considering the circumstances and the situation, would I do this?" And you know what? It helps me play my ROLE!
<P>Every day I pass this guy (and I'm talking real life now) on a street corner. He is ALWAYS there. And almost every day, I have to walk around him. He get's in my way at LEAST once every 24 hours, 5 days a week. YES, I'd like him to move. I would LOVE it! But I've never thought, "Okay, that's it. Tomorrow I'm bringing a friend and a blade and I'll get his ass out of my way." I'm just saying, try not to think like that in a ROLE PLAYING game, either!
<P>I dug Quake. I dug Duke Nukem. They both have their place, and it's NOT in EverQuest! They were not ROLE playing games. Please look to the future of online RPGs and help us SAVE PvP server on them! Sure, you can't get immediate satisfaction ALL the time. You want that, PLEASE go back to the frag fests. Play EQ in the genre for which it was created, taking into consideration more than just your 30 second gratification, then going in search for another one. Yes, I know, it's addictive and like a drug, but I PROMISE you, if you play a game like EQ in the way it was MEANT to be played, you will find SOOOOO much MORE PERMANENT satisfaction! I PROMISE! I've been in your shoes, my friend! Help this PvP online RPGing genre survive. Don't kill it for a quick fix, or I'm afraid you'll find yourself STARVED for what you helped destroy.
