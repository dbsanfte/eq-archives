</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> The server as far as I know will have no PvP LvL cap. This will

<BR>&gt; make a need for us to police our own: What are our Options?
<BR>&gt; Rather than lead into this one I'd like people to spew as many
<BR>&gt; ideas as possible.
<P>As i mentioned before, it could get troublesome for new players that join everquest like some 6 months from now..game will be developed people will so far advanced etc , some people might lose confidence and want to play the game by saying "Oh man I'll never get to the top (of "food" chain..hehe).."
<P>Emm problem with this is, current EQ setup ...1 Level is HUGE difference...so now all you need is individual which would now get lv50 cap, ...just make sure he doesn't die until he's lvl 55 or so and he'll surely be unbeatable, and plus he could group with his friends of lower levles, say lv40+ and they would sitll get nice experience shared, but yet level difference between them is soooo strong (compared to strenght of lv40 player and lv55 (assuming)...so even those unbeatable dragons then could be killed by single lv100 (yea right) players sometime then... it seems that then grouping with another player say lv 50..will cause that person to gain a lot of experience even tho its divided...unless leveling takes more and more experience for each level in which case this isn't true..
<P>Another thing is tho, with experience loss , dying at high levels would mean severe consequences...so i think higher level players shold (and most likely will) avoid hard monsters of their level...dying would mean loss of week(s) of work....
<BR>So, then only fun for them i to fight lesser creatures and PvP...and same with PVP why risk weeks of work in a single fight that lasts few minutes (or so)..whynot just kill everyone who is getting close to your level then, for example lv60..and just go chase lv50s and kill em easily cause of huge power difference (WHICH SHOULD BE MORE BALANCED, BUT NOT TOOO BALANCED)
<BR>so this way one could keep his supremacy...this isn't that bad but I think after couple of months when people start achieving high levels, 40-50s... balacing will need to be done..a lot of it considering hardest monsters, experience splitting, pvp combat, death..etc
