<P>> Umm...well I bought a small sewing kit,the sewing book, a tunic

<BR>&gt; pattern, and a high quality cat pelt. I was intending to make a
<BR>&gt; tunic but insted I made a "items did not combine to make
<BR>&gt; anything"!! I'm pretty sure I did what the book said to do
<BR>&gt; to make a tunic. A little help please?
<P>Boy! This answer might be a book in itself! :)
<P>To begin with, the type of pelt used determines the armor you make. A HQ (high quality) Cat pelt is only usable to make BANDED armor (I think that's it. I'm at work now and don't have my notes.) anyway, you need HQ Cat and a few things that only Blacksmithing can make in order to create the armor...that's why you failed. You didn't put the right items into your kit.
<P>You don't need a large kit to sew large things...at least, not that I've seen anyway. The larger kit allows you to sew things that require (1)pattern + (1)pelt + (1-4)studs/bands/whatever. The Small sewing kit only contains two "boxes" so you can only make normal leather stuff.
<P>To start out with, always use LQ (Low Quality) stuff. This makes the Tattered stuff (from my experience). Also, try to use Bear Hide as this makes all the LARGE armor size and it's easiest to do. Do this a few times until your skill is high enough to try Cat Pelt which makes Human size. Wolf Pelts make Small Size.
<P>That should be enough for you to start your tailoring business. OH! Almost forgot. Hope your rich or live in a place that has lots of wildlife....cause from what I have read on other posts and seen with MY character, the tailoring skill is kinda screwed up. The method they use to determine success is WAY outta our favor and the skill doesn't increase by use very fast. Best to try and hold off until you can dump a few practices into it (15 or 20?? <shrug>) and try. There is a big push right now to get EQ to loosen it up a bit so we can actually have a useful trade skill....but don't hold your breath. They have a lot of other things to fix too. :)
