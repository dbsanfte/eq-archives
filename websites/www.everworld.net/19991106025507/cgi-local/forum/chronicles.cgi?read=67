<P>Greetings. I am here to inform you of the death of Talym Shoontar. Being a Ranger of Surefall Glade, I have heard from my very earliest days of the great poacher Talym Shoontar. Talym was a poacher of great reknown who once even tried his had at Mammoth, the great bear of the caves of Surefall Glade. Mammoth was too much for him though, and he lost an eye in the battle. Though he was not able to take Mammoth, he succeeded in poaching other animals which are under our protection. Hager Sureshot, the noble leader of the Rangers at Surefall told me about this nefarious villian, of his usual hunting grounds in the Karanas and how he was sometimes seen in Qeynos Hills themselves, no doubt to meet up with others of his sort. Hager asked if I would like to join the hunt, and feeling enraged at the villiany of Talym, I heartily agreed.

<P>Thus began my search for Talym Shoontar. I scoured the Karanas for him for a long time, but could never find him. While I gave up my direct looking for Talym, I always kept an eye and ear out for signs of his presence. One day, while tracking a vile gnoll, I came across tracks which I believed to be those of Talym. Following them I came to the villian walking along the road in Qeynos Hills. Joyful that I had finally found and would be able to dispatch the villian, I instantly attacked. Unfortunately, Guard Nash happened to be nearby and seeing me attack another person, attacked me. Knowing there was not enough time to kill Talym before I was killed, I had to run. When I healed enough to return, he was gone.
<P>Time passed (as time has a way of doing ;-) in Norrath and I went along with my life, still keeping a sharp eye out for Talym. Then it finally happened. Yesterday evening I was traveling from Qeynos to BlackBurrow when once again I came across Talym's tracks. I tracked him to a spot near our previoius battle. I proceeded to attack him and lead him away from the road where a Guard would not be able to come to his aid this time. It was a close fight. I could tell that I barely had the edge over the villian and that he was a dangerous foe. I perservered however, and finally, with a mighty blow from Quicksilver (my Combine Long Sword) I ended Talym's poaching, once again doing my Rangerly duty of protecting my animal brethren.
<P>For proof of Talym's death, I took his head. Carrying it to Surefall Glade, I shouted the tale of his death throughout the hills, and upon arrival in Surefall Glade gave his head to Hager Sureshot at which point a cry of trumpets filled the air. Hager gave me an award for my deed, though it was not nescessary, for the knowledge that I had protected my friends from that villian was reward enough. And that my friends, was tale of the death of Talym Shoontar.
