<P>IS would seem that many people here don't like roleplaying, or only do it so ofter. For a long time I owuld have agreed, but I also play a lot of muds and pen/paper RPG's. My thoughts on roleplaying are this:

<P>Roleplaying makes the game interesting. It adds one element that you don't get bored of, because it is like real life. YOu truly interact with people. Most everything else in the game will become boring. In EVERY mud I played, high level charactes where roleplayers, not because it helped them get there, but because it kept the character interesting. WIth Pen/Paper RPG"s: the only ones that would last were the ones taht people roleplayed in.
<P>Roleplaying comes naturally: Many people think that roleplaying is having you character fill a preset mold. Some people choose this, and it is aviable optin, but it is stagnant. My charaters are affected by the world around them. If I gain the respect of a group of people, I will be more inclined to lead a future group. If I find that a race normally warring with my own will accept me, I will repsect that race. THese are things we do in real life. We act on past expierences. Roleplaying is in now way using "thee thou mine and wherefore" It is allowing a character that is not yourself to form inside the game.
<P>Roelplaying in not opposed to fun: Somewhat in summarey of my other 2 points, roleplaying is hard to avoid, and I have never had less fun becasue I did roelplay
