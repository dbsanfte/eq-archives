<P>I hear alot of talk about this guild or that guild being a bunch of PKing macroing fools in UO and that is the only reason they where good. Let me tell you something, everyone(PK or not) should have been macroing in UO. Most people did, and when the fighting was done the person who won was the better player. All that happened was the guilds used what resources where available to them to make them the best and then fought about it. The same thing is going to happen in EQ. I am already hearing the same type of excuses too.(They play 24/7, he was higher level than me, he used DOT spells which are illegal, he killed me after I fought a monster, I was AFK, etc., etc., etc.) I don't get it at all. You should know what the PvP server is. Call it a role-playing server, but you are just fooling yourself. Say it is supposed to be a role-playing server and you are correct, but it ain't gonna be.

<P>The PvP server is for competition and adaption. The better PK guilds realize this(as well as the fact that a good player at one game will be a good player at another game) and use whatever resources are available to make them the best for PvP then prove it. This is no secret, and you can do the same, or you can leave.
<P>They are already starting to make limitations which turned UO into a PvP nightmare(I mean the for PKers, not the non-PvP people on the PvP server). I personally believe whatever rules are in place now should stay the same, adapt or leave. I like the PvP combat. I know right now that the best PvPers are Druids, Wizards, and Necros. So naturally I will be one of those. You(not you necessarily nitpickers) say,"Well I wanna be a PvP warrior so make them more powerful!". Too bad, if you want to be a warrior just realize that they are not the greatest for PvP, and either be one anyways and avoid PvP, or hunt in groups, or do something(JUST ADAPT). The more I logon to see that the game has some new dumbass "feature" added the more upset I get. I don't mind adapting to a game, but I don't like adapting every single day.
<P>P.S. My UO example that doesn't pertain at all to EQ, yet... I was a mage fireballing everyone in site. The next day people without armor where hardly affected by fireballs so I got my halberding skill up making me a mage/warrior. The next day Archers become insanely more powerful than any other type and people that had an inside source murdered me with their archers. So, naturally, I made a char and worked that archery skill up only to find that when I was finally ready to do some killing that archers suck again. This wasn't actually a day by day experience, but some of you may remember these events. I just hope Verant doesn't continually listen to people's suggestions to make the game "more balanced" and "better". I like the fact that some classes are better for PvE, PvP, Solo and other such things. You should know what you are getting yourself into, please don't whine when you get there.
