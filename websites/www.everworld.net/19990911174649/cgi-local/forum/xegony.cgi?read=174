<P>The Republic of Rivervale is starting. After the success of the Republic of Rivervale, we are expanding and will have a republic for all the cities of norrath. A list of things open for the Republic of Rivervale, which we are looking for people to join, are below:

<P>Divisions: High Command
<P>Internal
<BR>Militia
<BR>Trade and Commerce
<BR>Religion
<BR>Army
<P>Divisions: Council
<P>Internal
<P>Public Relations
<P>Events
<P>Quests
<P>Meetings
<P>Advisors
<P>Sages
<P>Militia
<P>Captain of Guard
<P>Guards
<P>In City Patrols
<P>Trade and Commerce
<P>Trade Leaders
<P>Escorts
<P>Master Trade Skills
<P>Vendors
<P>Traveling Merchants
<P>Item Gatherers
<P>Religion
<P>Arch Wizard
<P>Arch Priest
<P>Religious Holidays and Events
<P>Crusade Leaders
<P>Army
<P>Commanders
<P>Army
<P>Outside Patrols
<P>We will all be connected with all the other republics of the world. There will be:
<BR>Republic of Freeport
<BR>Republic of Rivervale
<BR>Republic of Qeynos
<BR>Republic of Kaladim
<BR>Republic of Felwithe
<BR>Republic of Kelethin
<BR>Republic of Ak'anon
<BR>Republic of Erudin
<BR>Republic of Grobb
<BR>Republic of Halas
<BR>Republic of Neriak
<BR>Republic of Oggok
<BR>Republic of Highpass
<P>There will be a higher republic that consists of all the internal division leaders called the Republic of Norrath. These people will meet to discuss the progress they have made at their cities, any help they may need, trade routes being opened, and any other ideas that may be discussed. Eacg republic can have their own government and events and ideas as long as they keep trade open between the cities and have the division leaders and do not forget that and have 1 leader. At the moment, there are 2 republics, Rivervale and Freeport. Internal leaders of these are Krozy and Bamador. The Republic of Freeport is known and has mostly everything they need. The Republic of Rivervale still needs 3 people to be division leaders, as well as people wanting to be in council. We also need people to contribute by giving us money to help build up the Republic. If you are interested in joining up, email me at WPsoft62@bellatlantic.net. If you do, i can tell u everything that is to happen and what you can do to help. Also, if you want to help out the entire republic by starting the republics in the other cities and becoming a internal division leader, email me or Krozy at Krozy@mindspring.com. I hope to see many people interested in this and would like to help out Norrath by giving it a government, better than the ones already in the cities. This will be worthwhile to anyone wanting to make a name of themselves by helping others, and also to gain money and friends. So please reply to this as soon as possible so you can pick whatever you would like to do. We have many spots open.
