I write HTML, Java, and test software for a living and as such have a lot of time on line and am constantly connected to the internet at home and work.... though i do go afk :)

<BR>grow and learn along side with us. Role-playing is not expected but appreciated. The
<BR>following "In Game" guidelines should be adhered to:
<BR>1. Use proper chat commands i.e. when buying and selling items use the /auct command
<BR>, Keep shouting to a minimum(there are enough chat commands that will allow you to not
<BR>have to ever use the shout command except maybe when you level or to warn others
<BR>of impending doom)
<BR>2. Respect the Role playing of other characters.(if you chose not to role play as a
<BR>practice don't confuse other players by telling them about your non-eq self that is what the
<BR>/ooc command is for)
<BR>3. Use some common sense. (if you are a ranger from surefall glade worshiping Tunare
<BR>Don't go around killing bears and hacking down trees. If you are a dark elf necromancer
<BR>you might not want to jump in and rescue a high elf paladin that has bitten off more than he
<BR>can chew.)
<BR>4. Pking is a totally personal and should be used at your discretion. Pking a guild member
<BR>and dueling between guild members is forbidden and will call the wrath of Twilight to haunt
<BR>you for all eternity.

<BR>guild wars, In guild feasts, and local pub parties.
<P>Out of Game Guidelines:

<BR>As the guild will have no ranking cast it is set forth that we each mentor one another and
<BR>share helpful information by using this web site as an organizational hub. It will be your
<BR>responsibility to report the following to the site administrator.
<BR>1. Level Changes *
<BR>2. Quest information
<BR>3. Trade skill abilities and techniques *
<BR>4. Items you have for sale you would like to make available to other members.
<BR>5. Tales of your journeys throughout the realms
<BR>6. Weekly role call e-mail *(a deadline will be set for sending an e-mail to the administrator
<BR>stating your activity in the guild if this e-mail is not received the administrator will send you 1
<BR>reminder if you miss a second role call you will be dismissed from the guild.)
<BR>*=Required to retain membership in the guild.
<P>May the Gods Be with thee.
