<P>I have posted several times in regards to the PvP server but they are less appropriate in this forum than in the more popular guild forums. This board is more for suggestions and maybe complaints as I see it and a collection of screenshots of victims and corpses is not what we come to this board to see :P

<P>On another note, now that I am on a roll...
<P>Brad did indeed release a statement that only 5% of the player base was active on the PvP server and that the players, as a result of this statistic, had spoken. I just wanted to remind Brad of many important factors when considering the viability of a PvP server post-beta. Please keep in mind that a large portion of the players had characters to transfer from phase 3 and could not do so on the PvP server. Also remember that the very nature of PvP is that many players flock to it when fighting AI grows old and repetitive for them. Allow me to use myself as an example of a typical gamer... I have been a tester since phase 2 and was completely addicted to all aspects of the game until halfway through phase 3 when I completely lost interest after reaching level 29 with my Wizard character. So I am absent from Everquest for a month or so before the PvP Server is born. I log into the PvP server to see what it is all about and suddenly I'm back to playing evenings and weekends with every moment I can spare ;) The lacklustre PvP on a regular server simply doesn't provide the PvP aspect necessary to accomplish what I've described. It takes a server where everyone is potentially attackable to give that feeling of realism to gaining experience and having to be careful not to leave yourself too vulnerable at any one time because a rival may leap at the opportunity to take your head *grin*. You don't HAVE to attack players to enjoy the PvP server Brad, the simple threat of the danger is enough to make the experience, and the Roleplay, much more dynamic. Finally, what does a feeling of sharing and cooperation mean on the non-PvP servers where you can do nothing else in comparison to communities and player-enforced ettiquette formed on a PvP server where in fact, the players could all attack each other on sight. I think it speaks well of the calibre of our testers and the PvP community. Either way, please do not shelf the idea of at least a single PvP server in final without some serious thought and consideration, hopefully taking some of my experience into account ;)
