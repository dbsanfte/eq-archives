<P>Power is gained and ambition furthered through webs of alliances, influence,and betrayal. The heirs to this tradition of political machination have gathered together to further their own ambitions, both creating new alliances and

<BR>enemies as well as those that have been in the family for generations. There are those who know how the games of power are played, those who wish to learn, and those who do not. We are seeking those who know or who seek this knowledge.
<P>More OOCly, we are forming a roleplay intensive guild on Fennin Ro, with an emphasis on political machinations and creating intricate stories about our characters. There are 3 rules only for this guild:
<P>I. You must roleplay the majority of the time you are playing.
<P>II. You must write a character history and eventually a family history, which will help connect you with other guild members.
<P>III. You must be able to keep IC and OOC separate!!!
<P>Domus Sangreal (which is our working name, although we may vote on a new one before submitting final paperwork to Verant) is an ancient alliance of young nobles, influential clerics,and rich merchants as well as various friends and hangers-on of the above, who have gathered together to further their political ambitions. Politicking both within the guild and without is encouraged, and scheming and backstabbing is expected. However, loyalty to other guild members above and against outsiders is expected, as is aid to any guild member in extremity, whether said member is amongst your current enemies or not.
<P>Domus Sangreal is governed by a Council, with seats based on families or Temple position and influence. All members are free to scheme and jockey for a seat, and thus Council seats will be fluid. Council meetings are open to all members, and while only those with actual Council seats may vote, those without are free to sway votes through persuasion, bribery, blackmail, etc. The character and family history of members will be used to decide which families hold seats, which families are traditionally allies and enemies, as well as to connect individual characters. I believe that having IC connections like this greatly adds to one's roleplaying experience.
<P>As well as adventuring together whenever possible, we will also host parties, tournaments, and other social events. We expect to spend time together as friends, lovers, allies, and enemies.
<P>Suggested reading for tone and inspiration - The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli, A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, The Sunne in Splendour and Here Be Dragons by Sharon Kay Penman, Henry V and Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, and The Lions of Al-Rassan by Guy Gavriel Kay.
<P>If you are interested, please contact me (preferably via email) indicating your interest. Send details on your character if you have them, or that can be worked out later. Please also feel free to contribute ideas, comments and/or suggestions.
