<P>I agree with your assesment that most of his ideas realy don't fit into EQ, but i can see where he draws his solutions from. (UO and MUD's).

<P>But i want to make you aware of the one idea you seem to support *in idea*, the xp loss when attacking a lower level player is abuseable. I have seen it done on some pk mud's. Unless you visibly mark the player as being out of your range (since anon can hide his level), he could easily group in groups that are quite higher level than him, and have them take losses for xp in killing him. If there is some toggle button you have to click.. well, i'd hate to accidently attack a lower level player in the middle of a hairy fight..
<BR>I wont go into the details of the abuses possible, since i doubt (and hope not) that the level limit will be removed.
<P>As to the idea of an xp hit for killing 'friendly' creatures. I don't like it. You already will take a faction hit (if it is ever imped), so the xp hit be a double penalty. If there is no gain for pk'ing, there shouldn't be a loss. Anyhow, we don't award for good roleplaying, so why should we penalize for bad? And who knows, maybe someone would want to play a renegade High elf, or a Drizzit..
<P>Again, i would hope everyone reads my post below about factions, and how it could work to great benefit on the pvp server. I can see factions, with its unlimited scope, be alot more 'realistic' (as some would want to call it) than any static, simple good bad, race hate race system that seems so popular in RP games.
