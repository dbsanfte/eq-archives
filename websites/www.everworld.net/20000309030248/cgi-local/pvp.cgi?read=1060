<P>An acquaintance of mine happens to be on the EQVault staff and has been a beta tester since the beginning. Recently we spoke about EQ. After talking for a bit he started talking about the PvP server and how no one goes on it. How it shouldn’t be there and that it’s a waste of space…. things to that nature. It was then that I told him that I play on the PvP server. That I don’t PK but that I crave the excitement and rush I get from conflicts with other players. I related a story of how in all of my time playing on it I’ve only been attacked once but that it felt great to see a bunch of other stronger players coming to my defense. His attitude quickly changed after that and he didn’t have much more to say on the subject.

<P>I guess what I wanted to point out is that there are others out there in influential positions that haven’t even played on the server but having nothing nice to say about it. They’re all about having choices in EQ as long as its what they agree with. If they hate PvP so much you would think that they would be glad that there is a PvP server. That way most of us who enjoy that type of play, would most likely play there and not interrupt their fantasy role-playing utopia where there is no conflict other then hunting. Don’t get me wrong…I like the idea of a PvP switch too and support that kind of choice. Who knows…if things ever get outta hand on the PvP server with Kewl Dood PK gangs then I may find myself switching over.
<P>Just something for ya to ‘naw on.
