<P>> It is very easy to criticize and accuse d00dz of trying to ruin

<BR>&gt; your game while sitting back and doing nothing. It seems like
<BR>&gt; you didn't understand Geiger's intention for this board which is
<BR>&gt; for each people to give input and Verant will determine the
<BR>&gt; merits of our inputs, if you think some idea is very stupid then
<BR>&gt; give a THOUGHTFUL COUNTER-ARGUMENT.
<P>didn't i pretty much just write a goddamn master's thesis on the inherent problems in PvP as i see it??......again, the unpopular opinion is derided......it's only constructive input when you happen to agree with it, eh?
<P>or maybe you really were to dim to catch my point, WHICH IS (for the slow learners in the group), that just as a rather small minority of k3wLd00ds have disrupted the flow of reasonable discourse on this board so will they, in-game, be disruptive.......it doesn't take many (as is evidenced by the recent threads of "discussion")....if we are going to go to Verant (who couldn't possibly be more anti-k3wLd00d) and try to get positive changes effected to exisiting PvP mechanisms, we need to portray ourselves as having the best interests of the game world in mind or they simply will not listen.............btw, all the positive lobbying that all the (in general, highly intelligent) beta testers have done in the past is now being degraded and trivialized by every asinine post that every UO refugee posts here.....the only PvP will happen is the Verant way and the only way that will happen is without k3wLd00ds.............didya keep up that time??
<P>Geiger or other GMs aren't
<BR>&gt; idiots, why do you think they'll listen to d00dz more than you?
<P>honestly, i don;t really hear gieger saying much of anything to indicate who's he's listening to....all i know about him is that i assume he was, at one point, active in UO which makes me question his credibility as an authority on EQ PvP
<P>&gt; And by the way get off the high horse, a lot of people giving
<BR>&gt; opinions here have 1) long years of mudding 2) play both -PvP
<BR>&gt; and +PvP 3) have experience with coding and balancing issues.
<P>it's not the intelligent posts that i find obnoxious ;).........and where would you like me pin your "King of All Roleplaying" medal?
<P>&gt; ps. your seem to hate the level idea a lot, why not give reasons
<BR>&gt; why it would be bad idea other than rhetorics? unless you don't
<BR>&gt; have anything constructive to say beside accusing everyone to be
<BR>&gt; d00dz.
<P>as i have said repetitively, Mr. "coding and balancing issue" that to throw out the level system involves rewriting almost every ( i would presume) class object in the source........a rather optimistic project don't ya think?...especially cosidering the amount of bugs that still exist 4 weeks before the projected relaese date.....
<P>i'm really not trying to flame anyone here but i have little patience so i get snippy fast......all i'm trying to do is point out flaws inherent to the notion of a UO Pvp in EQ.....and to point out to people that there are better PvP games out there because EQ really wasn't made to support that style of gameplay from the beginning
