<P>"To bathe in the waters of life

<BR>and the grandeur of inspiration."
<P>Greetings Adventurer,
<P>I, Qurak Shi'Kyn, Druid of Rivervale and follower of Karana, do hereby put forth a decree.
<BR>A terrible storm passed several nights passed, and as I stood alone, soaking in its powerful, desctructive beauty, a vision was granted me by my God; may his storm forever rage. I have been charged with this duty, and thus carry it out: The Emerald Covenant is formed. The harmony of forests will echo with our spirits, and the plains of war with our footfalls. I ask all souls with desire to join or interest to know more to contact me. If you possess the strength to best your enemies, and the wisdom to remember who your enemy is, the Emerald Covenant welcomes you.
<BR>May Karana Rain Life Upon You,
<BR>Qurak Shi'Kyn, son of Ynys Affalon, the Water Mothers
<P>*OOC*
<P>I have decided to form the Emerald Covenant before commercial release, and I hope that
<BR>it becomes a success in the weeks and months to come. T.E.C. will be located on the Rallos Zek (PVP) server. Our goal is multi-faceted. Initially, I hope it provides a place where players can gather peacefully and prepare for the coming months, or years, of war. As the guild grows, I hope it will become a mediating force; it's main goal will be to use force of numbers to maintain in order to the PVP which goes on. We oppose mindless killing sprees, multiple pointless killings, outnumbered, outgunned, or outmuscled battles - basically unfair and unfounded fights. We support organized raids, serious roleplaying meshed with PVP, and fair, honorable bouts. Which brings me to the guild's most important purpose: balance. If two many people seem to be creating evil PVPers, The Emerald Covenant will ally with the forces of good in order to strike a harmony. If the opposite is true, the Covenant will realign. In other words, we seek to prevent any unfair alignment advantages by taking the weaker side and attempting to strengthen it. This means that our guild will not be an easy one to be in. If you are not a serious pkiller ready
<BR>to take on the challenge of facing the stronger side, then perhaps The Syndicate is the place for you.
<P>This is not going to be a "Our guilds goal is to be the most powerful, and the most famous and the one with the most money, and the most members." In other words, The Emerald Covenant will be different than the slew of guilds which seem to be one of two things:"We want to be the most powerful good guild," or "We want the most powerful evil guild."If it's mindless numbers of blindly accepted members in order to give some leader a sense of importance, this is not the guild for you. If you are a serious roleplayer, and a serious player-killer, then you might consider contacting me for further information. Right now, since there is no indication of which alignment will be more powerful, I am accepting "applications" from characters of all races and classes. If you are interested in maintaing order and balance to the PVP server, and perhaps impressing upon Verant and Mr. McQuaid that the server can be as rich with roleplaying and interactivity as the others, then please contact me and I will provide you with further information of The Emerald Covenant's OOC and IC goals and organization.
<P>"In former times, Druids could intervene and stop contending armies from fighting.
<BR>Thus, even among the most savage barbarians, anger yields to wisdom." [Strabo]
