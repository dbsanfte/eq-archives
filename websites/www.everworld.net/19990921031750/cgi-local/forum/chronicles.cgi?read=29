<P>Chapter XIII The Folly of the Necromancer by Cathal

<P>The Master's eyes locked on Pigorsh, forgetting the girl instantly. He
<BR>uttered a word and held out his hand towards the gnome. Pigorsh
<BR>floated over towards the Master, completely lost in the stone. He
<BR>settled down at the Master's feet, the necromancer now learing at the
<BR>little gnome, and the object in his hands.
<BR>"My, what have you found there you little rodent?"
<BR>Pigorsh never responded, nor did he even seem to be aware of anything
<BR>going on around him. The 'rock' was jet black, devoid of any surface
<BR>features, if in fact it had a surface. As it was now it simply seemed to
<BR>be an insubstantial shadow. It had, however, the disconcerting tendancy
<BR>to change size and shape, as if things were battling within it's
<BR>confines to get out.
<BR>"You may give that back to me now, you little thief." The Master held
<BR>out his hand.
<BR>Pigorsh didn't respond.
<BR>"NOW! LOOK AT ME," the Master bellowed. Pigorsh slowly looked up,
<BR>bewilderment engraved in his features. "Now little rat hand it to me."
<BR>Pigorsh held the thing out to his new master.
<BR>"NO!!!," screamed E'gaile, as she stumbled backward away from the outstretched hands of the undead, delirious with fright. They were reaching for her with loathsome desire, desire for her flesh, to tear her living body apart. She screamed again as one of the dead and rotting fingers caressed her arm. She stumbled and fell, the undead upon her, surrounding her, touching and violating her. She couldn't scream again nor could she even will herself to move. Her mind was running, leaving her body to the horrible torment that awaited it.
<BR>The Master was laughing now, 'How easily they are overcome with my power', he mused, laughing harder now. With a word and simple gesture the undead stopped, with another word they collapsed in a heap. He walked over to where the girl lay, unconcious, but otherwise unharmed. "I may have better uses for you my pretty little elf, I'm sure you won't mind...and if you do bore me again I can always bring my...'pets' back." He chuckled at this as if he had just made a very clever joke.
<BR>***
<BR>E'gaile awoke, cold and in the dark. She couldn't remember how she came to be where she was, nor for that matter, she couldn't seem to recall the events of the last few days. She lay on her back staring up into the darkness, feeling a hard, cold surface beneath her. 'Stone', she thought, 'I must be lying on a stone bed.' She didn't even bother to look around, it didn't matter. Not if she couldn't remember why and how she came to be here. She remembered riding through the woods, with someone else. She remembered they were running away, she was with...and then she knew, the tears came unbidden, streaming down her face as she sobbed, she desperately wanted to go back to that place of peaceful forgetfulness. She cried for a long time, until the tears wouldn't come any more, but still her body ached.
<BR>"Now, now little one. Please don't fret, it can't be that bad." A mocking, patronizing voice said. The voice was pitched a little too high it seemed, on the verge of madness.
<BR>She became rigid, not even daring to breath. 'Oh will it never end,' she moaned to her herself. She felt herself slipping away to that dark peaceful place, but no, she fought it. There was nothing else left for her to do. And she was angry. Angry because everything she had, even her small dreams and hopes had been taken away from her. She had nothing left...but anger.
<BR>E'gaile heard movement from somewhere in the darkness, though she was now aware of shapes around her, as if she were in a natural cavern of some sort. The movement took on the sound of footsteps, coming towards her. She strained to look about to see who was in the room with her, only to find that she was bound.
<BR>"I've been watching you for hours my darling."
<BR>The way he said 'darling' made her cringe within herself. Her fear once again threatening to take over, pushing her only strength away, her anger.
<BR>"I have learned many things about you. Do you know you talk in your sleep?" He chuckled at this. "I have given a lot of thought to how you may best serve me. Do you know that?" He kept himself out of her sight, it made what little control she retained slip away.
<BR>He walked away, but returned shortly, this time standing so she could see him. He was holding the black sphere that Pigorsh had given him. "Do you know what this is?"
<BR>She just shook her head, she couldn't trust her voice.
<BR>"It's a portal of sorts, it allows me to bring the dead forth. But not just their bodies, their spirits as well." He was grinning at her, his eyes gleaming with mad ambition. "But not only that, it allows me to send the living to the world of the dead as well!" It seemed as if he would hardly be able to contain himself. He couldn't, the laugh started as a chuckle but quickly rose to that of a deranged lunatic, echoing off the chamber walls.
<BR>E'gaile wanted to cover her ears but she couldn't, she closed her eyes tight as if that would help keep out the insane laughing. She fought back the tears once more, she opened her eyes. She looked straight at her tormentor and shouted "You're nothing but a coward, a mad insane coward!"
<BR>He stopped his luaghing almost instantly, putting on a serious face, devoid of any humor, or sanity and said "Perhaps you would like to be the first to visit the world of the dead."
