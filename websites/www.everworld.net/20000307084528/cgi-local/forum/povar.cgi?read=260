<P>I must say.. This is certainly the last ditch attempt at actually getting something good going on Povar... And it's a plea to the players as well as the Guides and GMs of our server.

<P>To begin with, I state that I love Povar. The people are great, the GMs are nice, and overall it's a very good server in my opinion. But it lacks in one field - Dynamic Quests and Events. I will describe this more in detail now..
<P>Events - Okay, I don't mean like "Reunions" and stuff like that.. I'm talking everything. Drunken Bashes, Brawls, Arena Fights, Dungeon Raids, Plane of Fear deat.. I mean.. Attacks. Everything! There has currently to my knowledge been *NO* events held on Povar that weren't completely dominated by a single guild. (Grey Council and Steel Accordance come to mind here, no offense to these two fine guilds =). We need some events that everyone can participate in.. A dungeon raid on Solusek, or a Drunken Bash in the Ro tunnel.. I don't care.. the more events we have, the better the chance that GMs will take an interest in Povar and want to run Dynamic Quests. These are the first priority, and I think we need to get some organization in our Events. The current level 50's out there are just hoarding all the fun, and we need to get some awesome events to get the fun back in being Mid level =)
<P>Dynamic Quests - Have we ever even had one besides that Butcherblock Hammer one that was run on all servers? Povar's GMs need to get some order here, and maybe set a goal of doing One dynamic quest a month with a nice reward and a good story. Povar is lacking in this field mainly because many of the GMs that I have met lack the drive to do something massive, and therefore only do small quests, and even these are quite rare, I assure you. The more events we have, the more dynamic quests will be run, I'm positive of this. Look at Fennin Ro - Theres a player event on that server every day.. and Dynamic Quests are quite prevalent as well.
<P>Well, this is just my two cents.. I really think Povar needs some direction, and unfortunately I do not have the time, energy, and resources to give it direction.. I will merely instrument the beginning of the fun, and pray that someone can take over.
