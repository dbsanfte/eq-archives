<P>Druids rule 1v1, they are the most well rounded class. This means that of all the major skills/stats they are pretty good if not at least average at everything. example: Hit points - They have higher HP than all other casting classes, Melee - They are actually able to defend themsleves with melee weapons effectively, this is mainly a bonus at lower levels till about 14th, Spell casting - They have a extremely diverse spell portfolio, and can deal damage and heal - this combination alone places them at the top of the heap. To be able to heal as well as they do makes them damn near unstoppable if the player knows what he's doing 1v1 at least.

<P>Now as far as group fights go, you will need a diverse group to be the victor, and the balances shift at higher levels. A wizard after level 20 can lay some serious ass whoop down with VERY high damage spells. Wizards are second to none for sheilding spells, leather skin makes the difference at higher levels. I believe that due to this one spell the Wizard will be king PvP 1v1 after level 20.
<P>As far as races go for each of these classes I would have to say Halfling for druid and Erudite for Wizard. Halfing is a clearly better race for druids, but Erudites have only a mild advantage in Int and Agil combo for wizards, Both Dark Elf and Gnome are EXTREMELY viable for wizards with High elf pulling up a close 3rd place.
<P>It is my honest opinion that ANY race can be king in any class, and that the burden is on the skill of the player. Some classes will never be able to hang 1v1, but will in the end have a use. Example: Rogue gets destroyed 1v1 by just about any casting class, but in a group fight with backstab shows his value. A rogue at level 20 can deal out some pretty sweet damage between backstab and dual weild in a group. The PvP server is about group battles after all not a bunch of duels. If you wanna duel you can do that on the regular servers. We need to be gearing our class/race selections to group situations not 1v1 tests of individual egos.
<P>Just my humble opinion. Hope to see you all on the battlefeild!!!

<P>&gt; Is the better class/race combos.. Which do you feel still need
<BR>&gt; more tweaking.. I think the rogue is probably the most
<BR>&gt; underpowered, they aren't really a great pvp class until they
<BR>&gt; get backstab at 10 and even then they can't stand toe to toe
<BR>&gt; against much without duel weild. Necromancers definetly were
<BR>&gt; great in early levels but how will they fare in level 10+
<BR>&gt; stuff..I think the better class's will be the ones that can
<BR>&gt; fight hand to hand and still cast some magic..
<BR>&gt; Paladins/clerics/sk's.. Maybe even druids.. I don't think
<BR>&gt; rangers will be great, but bards in a group will definetly kick
<BR>&gt; ass, especially at higher levels with that party invisible
<BR>&gt; song..
<P>&gt; I really hope that verant bumps up the levels of the people that
<BR>&gt; play on the pvp server so we can test pvp as it should be
<BR>&gt; fought..
<P>&gt; Oh well. Gimme your thoughts about your preferred race/class..
