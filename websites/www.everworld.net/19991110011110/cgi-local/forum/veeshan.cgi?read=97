<P>Throughout your message, you refer to your deeds of valor against the various evil races of Faydwer, yet do not discuss the nature of your personal relationship with your deity. That is the fulcrum on which your argument must swing. Bertoxxulous is evil. Period. I understand that many people who desire to play necromancers or shadowknights are frustrated that they do not have the option to be agnostic but this is by design. The very nature of your powers is divinely granted by an evil deity. Therefore your powers are evil in and of themselves. While a member of an evil race can become good, it is my opinion that a member of an evil class may not. I have even heard rumors that the shadowknights are required to perform evil acts (slaying a paladin) in order to fully pursue and maximize their abilities. If you truly wish to pursue the idea of roleplaying a character worshiping an evil deity but being good themselves, one way might be to to portray yourself as having "put one over" on Bertoxxulous (good luck) and hid the fact from your evil brethren that you are an infiltrator and ultimately plan to subvert and sabotage their efforts through your greater understaning of the nature of death and the effects of their evil powers. You must understand that what you are doing is asking other players to suspend the element of realism for the opportunity to avail themselves of your abilities and friendship. Those who choose not to do so, must be allowed that choice with no ill feelings. Many guilds are not willing to do make such a compromise. Guilds coming from UO have been especially torn by this as in that world, everyone was the same and the players had no options and now that the options are so wide open, a choice must be made: adapt and accept the various desires of the members and hope to have something resembling a cohesive background or lose members. There are many guilds however that accept all races and classes so perhaps you may need to look a little further. One thing I have not seen and I hope I never do is someone who for the sake of playing with people who are "evil" decides that their Paladin of Mithaniel Marr has decided to "rid the world of good and all of the fair races". Put into that context, surely you can see my point. Seems pretty ridiculous, no? I have a great deal of respect for those who have chosen an evil race/class combo and decided to actually play an evil character for they have indeed chosen the road less travelled and are to be commended for choosing the most difficult characters to effectively play. In any event, good luck to you and I hope you find a home.
