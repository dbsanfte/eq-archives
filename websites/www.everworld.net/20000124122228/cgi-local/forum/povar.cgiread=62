<P>> Before you begin reading the following, let

<BR>&gt; me explain my motives behind
<BR>&gt; sending such a lengthy email. For one,
<BR>&gt; chatting about ForeverQuest (whome my guild
<BR>&gt; may be come the Povar division of, for more
<BR>&gt; info email me at TaoToads@hotmail.com) with
<BR>&gt; some friends stirred a bit of RP fanaticism
<BR>&gt; in me, so I went by
<BR>&gt; NorrathRP. I went to their Communal Hall,
<BR>&gt; scrolled down and saw
<BR>&gt; something that attracted my eye. This post.
<BR>&gt; Its remarkably similar to
<BR>&gt; what I had already pondered. If this
<BR>&gt; interests you, email me (not the
<BR>&gt; list, email TaoToads@hotmail.com) and if I
<BR>&gt; get a high level of feedback,
<BR>&gt; I'll put it forth to the developing FQP for
<BR>&gt; Povar. I'd like to tack on
<BR>&gt; a few of my own creations/options with this
<BR>&gt; city-state guild idea:
<BR>&gt; --real guilds could be mercenary bands,
<BR>&gt; Religous orders, etc that
<BR>&gt; migrated from city-to-city or swore
<BR>&gt; allegience to a city-state but
<BR>&gt; remained autonomous (happened in Crusades
<BR>&gt; with the Knights Templar
<BR>&gt; swearing to protect Holy Land but reamining
<BR>&gt; autonomous).
<BR>&gt; --totally PC city-states could arise from
<BR>&gt; zones that have neutral
<BR>&gt; vendors (after all, an economy is needed by
<BR>&gt; any nation) and they
<BR>&gt; interact with the NPC-PC city-states..
<P>&gt; And now, the post:
<P>&gt; A few days back, someone offered the idea of
<BR>&gt; racial guilds. Next,
<BR>&gt; someone offered up faction guilds. Then I
<BR>&gt; waded in with two big Good vs.
<BR>&gt; Evil guilds.
<P>&gt; In truth, each of these has its own
<BR>&gt; strenghts and flaws. But
<BR>&gt; after stewing on all this for a couple days,
<BR>&gt; I think I
<BR>&gt; have a system figured out that will make
<BR>&gt; this really work. The key is
<BR>&gt; not to reinvent the wheel. Do what AD&D used
<BR>&gt; to do - borrow from
<BR>&gt; medieval history. When you look back, you
<BR>&gt; realize the cleanest,
<BR>&gt; simplest, most realistic solution is the
<BR>&gt; most obvious one.
<P>&gt; A Fuedal System.
<P>&gt; In fuedal europe (which all high fantasy is
<BR>&gt; based on) every
<BR>&gt; citizen swore fealty to Lord or King. This
<BR>&gt; brought with it
<BR>&gt; responsibility and pride. Geoff of Camelot
<BR>&gt; meant something. If Arthur
<BR>&gt; declared war upon the next kingdom, then YOU
<BR>&gt; were at war with that
<BR>&gt; kingdom.
<P>&gt; Duty, honor, loyalty, brotherhood.
<P>&gt; For every man, a King.
<BR>&gt; Race, religion, and ethos bleed naturally
<BR>&gt; into this.
<P>&gt; Usually, your own ethics will match with
<BR>&gt; your
<BR>&gt; kingdom's. Exceptions will happen, of
<BR>&gt; course. But that's what makes life
<BR>&gt; intereting. To truly roleplay High Fantasy,
<BR>&gt; is to roleplay within a
<BR>&gt; fuedal system of some kind.
<P>&gt; So what's my proposal?
<P>&gt; Each city-state of Norrath becomes on huge
<BR>&gt; guild. Neriak,
<BR>&gt; Kaladim, Qeynos, and so on. The
<BR>&gt; "guildmasters" will be
<BR>&gt; NRStaff-controlled NPCs who are key
<BR>&gt; government/military figures in that
<BR>&gt; town. The Generals, the Knight-Commanders,
<BR>&gt; and so on. We'll research
<BR>&gt; with 989 the ethics of that particular
<BR>&gt; city's ruler and a staff member
<BR>&gt; will dutifully roleplay that ruler's
<BR>&gt; "right hand man" in a way that
<BR>&gt; makes sense, passing down orders from the
<BR>&gt; King to his faithful subjects.
<P>&gt; We can work with the people at Heartstone
<BR>&gt; and Forever Quest to
<BR>&gt; create a living breathing world with
<BR>&gt; politics and wars and intrigue and
<BR>&gt; alliances. Norrath will come to life,
<BR>&gt; combining the excitement of
<BR>&gt; PK with the drama of good roleplaying.
<P>&gt; Norrath - the Fuedal Wars.
<P>&gt; Some quick issues handled in FAQ format:
<P>&gt; Q: Why not races?
<P>&gt; A: By doing the city-state thing, you're
<BR>&gt; doing racial
<BR>&gt; tension with a more realistic, political
<BR>&gt; twist. It's the same, just a
<BR>&gt; bit better. And . . . a Drizzt type
<BR>&gt; character has a chance of one day
<BR>&gt; swearing loyalty to Qeynos. (and possibly
<BR>&gt; facing his own kin in battle.
<BR>&gt; very cool)
<P>&gt; Q: Why not good vs. evil?
<P>&gt; A: Well, this gets messy. For starters some
<BR>&gt; of the gods
<BR>&gt; themselves stradle the line. We could argue
<BR>&gt; forever about gods like
<BR>&gt; Rallos Zek and Bristlebane. More
<BR>&gt; importantly, no Human Shadowknight
<BR>&gt; wants to walk around Qeynos with the title
<BR>&gt; (evil). As the guild function
<BR>&gt; gives you a last name/title. Besides, its
<BR>&gt; quite possible to have an evil
<BR>&gt; High Elf who loves Felwithe and his kin
<BR>&gt; enough to fight beside them
<BR>&gt; against invaders.
<P>&gt; Also, it allows for unsual events. What if
<BR>&gt; the ruler of
<BR>&gt; Felwithe and the ruler of Kelethin get
<BR>&gt; heated about rights to the
<BR>&gt; forest? What if an elven war breaks out?
<BR>&gt; This could not be possible with
<BR>&gt; good vs. evil.
<P>&gt; Q: Hmmm. Speaking of Shadow Knights, what
<BR>&gt; would a human
<BR>&gt; Shadow Knight of Qeynos do in this scenario?
<P>&gt; A: Well, we'd have to double check the facts
<BR>&gt; with Verant.
<BR>&gt; But my understanding is that Antonios Bayle
<BR>&gt; is a good Paladin and that
<BR>&gt; the 'evil' folk of Qeynos are forced to
<BR>&gt; slither about the sewers and
<BR>&gt; hide their art from his wrath. To me, this
<BR>&gt; says they would never be
<BR>&gt; accepted in that society. To roleplay a
<BR>&gt; character who lives that
<BR>&gt; underground lifestyle you wouldn't be
<BR>&gt; concerned about fighting for god
<BR>&gt; and country. And if you were, it would be
<BR>&gt; one of the other Kingdom's
<BR>&gt; where you'd feel more loyal. Neriak,
<BR>&gt; perhaps. Or Paineel.
<P>&gt; Q: Will Norrath Roleplay dictate everything?
<P>&gt; A: Hmmm. Good question. There's a lot to be
<BR>&gt; said for a
<BR>&gt; clean storyline. But as you know, we at
<BR>&gt; Norrath Roleplay try to handle
<BR>&gt; everything as democratically as possible. I
<BR>&gt; imagine it would be a hybrid
<BR>&gt; between these two approaches. An idea from
<BR>&gt; someone's message post might
<BR>&gt; 'mysteriously' find its way into the
<BR>&gt; storyline. If a King's knights are
<BR>&gt; screaming for Ogre blood, he'd be wise to
<BR>&gt; listen. So, we'll see.
<P>&gt; Q: What next?
<P>&gt; A: Next we have to figure out some details
<BR>&gt; about the guild
<BR>&gt; system. Can a guild be at war with multiple
<BR>&gt; guilds at once? This would
<BR>&gt; be great because it allows alliances to
<BR>&gt; form. How do the guild titles
<BR>&gt; work? Are they always on. Optional? Should
<BR>&gt; we enforce the flag to always
<BR>&gt; fly?
<P>&gt; Q: How many people can we get?
<P>&gt; A: I bet we can get a good half of the
<BR>&gt; server to
<BR>&gt; contribute. People love mass events. Even
<BR>&gt; roleplayers love violence. As
<BR>&gt; long it makes sense, and you don't lose all
<BR>&gt; your money to some idiot for
<BR>&gt; no good reason. I think this'll be huge.
<P>&gt; That's it. Jump in the debate and voice your
<BR>&gt; ideas.
<BR>&gt; This thing may be a reality within a week or
<BR>&gt; two, if enough
<BR>&gt; people show interest. Now's your chance to
<BR>&gt; shape it.
<P>&gt; - Kha'Dorak
<P>I think this is a grea idea. I hope to see something along these lines in the near future.
<P>Question: Would the Com AI get involved?Neighboring cities/clans are at war, will AI/guards get into the action?
<P>I really think you got a great idea here and I would love to see it happen.
