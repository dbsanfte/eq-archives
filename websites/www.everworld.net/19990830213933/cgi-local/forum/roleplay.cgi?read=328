<P>"I am Cynius Sarcas, kind sir." Cyn replies with respect and a sly grin. "Wandering bard, and all around good fellow. I seek only passage to Faydwer, and the more discreet the better." Cynius looks around the boat and mutters, "and I don't think I can be more discreet than this."
<P>The Erudite gaszes even harder at the half elf, and Cyn can practically feel himself being thrown in the water already.
<P>"But for passage I can gladly pay in my own services. Surely a song to ease the ache in your bodies, and perhaps thine and the ladies hearts as well?" A glance toward the sleeping beauty. "A nice serenade? But in addition, shouldst thou need menial tasks and chores down, I can also provide assistance, either in the boat, or upon land, if needed. I am handy with a sword, and fluent in the elven tongue, which may come in handy once we reach our destination. Others don't have to know that I am such a linguist, if u get my meaning? Sometimes feigning ignorance is best."
<P>The necromancer still seemed unphased. Cynius kept on in a calm tongue, knowing that to show fear at this point may cost him his life, or at least an end to his quest.
<P>"I fear not the 'dark arts' as others call them, and accept that each man has his right to pursue power to better himself in his own way. Why not a year ago I was an agent of a troll host that traveled through lower Antonica... But that is off the subject." Cyn could sense growing impatience in the man. "I ask no questions, and as long as our goals lie in the same direction, and your bodyguard before seems to have, uhhh disappeared, I think it would be mutually beneficial for us to travel together. Spell, Song, Sword, and "looking at the maiden "Sunshine can make a powerful combination." A broad grin split Cyn's face, and he began to sing a light song about relieving tensions and stress, and feeling whole again. Vigor and health returned after what was lost on the ship, and the lady smiled in her sleep as well. Even the Erudite's lips turned up a tad at the corners,though from the pleasant healing effects or a scheming mind, young Cynius could not tell...
