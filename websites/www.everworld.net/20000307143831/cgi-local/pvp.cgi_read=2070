<P>> DUEL. Some players are upset with the "/d" shortcut

<BR>&gt; for dueling. Apparently certain
<BR>&gt; PKs find it entertaining to tell players to "type /d and
<BR>&gt; Ill give you X" or "type /d to test this
<BR>&gt; for me" on much lower characters and then slaughter them.
<BR>&gt; Granted there is a sick humor
<BR>&gt; in it, but some players are young, naive, or don't understand
<BR>&gt; English very well. We might
<BR>&gt; consider removing the '/d' shortcut and requiring that '/duel'
<BR>&gt; be typed in full.
<P>This is a non-issue. Only a newbie would get caught by it and then only one time. There are real issues to deal with so why waste time on the petty stuff.
<P>&gt; /CON. There is universal support on the PvP server that PvP
<BR>&gt; players should not be able
<BR>&gt; to /con one another. There is not universal agreement on how it
<BR>&gt; should be modified
<BR>&gt; though. No one disputes that if you are 4 should be red.
<BR>&gt; I feel that for 3-4 levels difference there should be a
<BR>&gt; yellow/blue indicator, and 0-2 should
<BR>&gt; be neutral (black/white). Others feel that nothing should be
<BR>&gt; revealed for /con within +/-4
<BR>&gt; levels. Take your pick, either way it's a BAD feature to have
<BR>&gt; /con for PvP players.
<BR>&gt; Disabling it for players would be an acceptable simple
<BR>&gt; workaround for Rallos Zek/PvP
<BR>&gt; players in general.
<P>Agreed.
<P>&gt; XP LOSS LOOPHOLE. When PvP combat occurs, if a player is wounded
<BR>&gt; below 0
<BR>&gt; health but not killed, they will bleed to death and lose XP as
<BR>&gt; if they were killed by a
<BR>&gt; MOB. This should not be the case. PvP players sometimes
<BR>&gt; intentionally exploit this
<BR>&gt; loophole using spell combinations to force players to lose XP.
<BR>&gt; If the majority of damage is
<BR>&gt; caused by PvP combat then the XP loss from bleeding should not
<BR>&gt; occur, instead treat it as
<BR>&gt; a PvP death.
<P>This is a bug that I assume will be fixed in time. It's not really a pvp issue.
<P>&gt; FACTIONS.. The PvP players seem to agree that there should be
<BR>&gt; faction hits for killing other
<BR>&gt; players who are of your same race. There are many variants to
<BR>&gt; this scenario, but at the
<BR>&gt; minimum you should take a decent hit to your factions for
<BR>&gt; same-race kills (unless initiated
<BR>&gt; by /duel or a guild war). Should not be too much work and it's
<BR>&gt; one of the bigger issues on
<BR>&gt; the server.
<P>I don't know who you've been speaking to, but factions are not an issue that players agree on. The vast majority of people who enjoy PvP are totally against this for many reason already listed on other boards. Any code put in to discourage pvp fights should be kept on the other servers.
<P>&gt; LOOTING. Backpacks should be lootable. You need to be able to
<BR>&gt; open them when electing an item to loot. Players use this as a
<BR>&gt; workaround to hide items from potentially being looted. This I
<BR>&gt; suspect was a coding convenience at the time, and it would be
<BR>&gt; nice to have the fix completed.
<P>Again...bagging equipment is a good way to encourage pvp. If they remove the bagging, mage classes will simply gate to the bank. This one would discriminate against the melee classes. Something they really dont need.
<P>&gt; +/-4 LEVEL LIMIT. The level limit should be flexed as players
<BR>&gt; increase in level. Using the same model that is used with
<BR>&gt; allowing grouping experience gains should work work allowing
<BR>&gt; PvP. A side issue, lots of weaker players want to jump in and
<BR>&gt; help when higher level comrade is attacked. Personally I think
<BR>&gt; it's suicide but they want it. A lower level should be able to
<BR>&gt; attack someone more than 4 levels above them at their own
<BR>&gt; discretion. They should probably get a confirmation promt
<BR>&gt; before they can do it (as with deleting an item). Once they
<BR>&gt; initiate the attack then obviously the player they attacked can
<BR>&gt; freely attack back (initiate a /d situation between the two). In
<BR>&gt; a sense lower players should at any time be able to initiate a
<BR>&gt; /duel with a
<BR>&gt; higher level without requiring their consent as long as both are
<BR>&gt; PvP. The level limit protection is only requried to protect the
<BR>&gt; higher from the lower, not to protect the lower from their own
<BR>&gt; recklessness/stupidity.
<P>I agree with the flexible levels as they increase. Allowing lower levels to attack higher levels without restriction is a bad idea. It would allow someone to wait until a high level player has spent their mana and is low on hit pts before initiating a fight. The high level player would then be unable to come back and kill the newbie that jumped him.
