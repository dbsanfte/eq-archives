</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>You make excellent points, and I find it difficult to argue with what you have to say. Probably the best -PvP post I have ever read. As it would take a great deal of effort on my part to explain exactly why I support a universal playerkilling system, I will respond to portions of your post and try to give you a general idea of what it is I like about universal playerkilling.

<P>&gt; Look, here's my POV on this as a -PvP. When the game is out
<BR>&gt; of Beta and I'm paying my $10 a month (or whatever), I don't
<BR>&gt; want
<BR>&gt; to have to deal with having my progress hindered by a random PK.
<P>That's just it. The ideal goal here is to eliminate "random" PK. Certainly now this ideal is a long way off, not technologically but systematically speaking, but that is the goal of my systems and suggestions. Roleplaying is supposed to be just that, playing a "role," not carrying out random actions based on your desire to infringe on someone else's fun. If you have mouthed off to someone, made too many enemies, stepped on too many toes, or put your nose where it doesn't belong; then maybe it needs a punching. If you prefer not to PK, then you avoid interefering with people, you avoid "pissing people off" and you basically avoid trouble. "Random" PK is what I refer to as PK Abuse. My goal is to curtail or eliminate this through a system of severe punishments for repeat PK offenders and administrative intervention for PKillers who are not doing so in the context of a "role."
<P>&gt; It's like living in a bad neighborhood. Say I
<BR>&gt; rented an
<BR>&gt; apartment in Northeast D.C. and was burglarized and assaulted on
<BR>&gt; a daily basis -- I would move without question.
<P>Herein lies a partial explanation as to why I support universal PK. If done well, Playerkilling adds an element of fear unlike the unpleasnat fear of real life, because we know "it's just a game." The idea of being involved in an assault or a burglary or robbery or murder, etc. in a fantasy world is more appealing that in real life, even from the victim's standpoint. Systems do exist which will make playerkilling less of a burdgen and more of a feature. Yes, currently these systems are lacking and unsuccessful, but the potential is there to correct past mistakes - instead of avoiding the problem with the PvP switch.
<P>&gt; If EQ implements
<BR>&gt; a PvP system where I can get killed by a random thug, then I
<BR>&gt; think it's
<BR>&gt; a safe bet that I (and I'm sure a lot of the other people) will
<BR>&gt; quit
<BR>&gt; playing the game, cancel our accounts, and go back to playing
<BR>&gt; single
<BR>&gt; player RPG's.
<P>If the system is implemented badly, yes. If it is successful, It's a safe bet you and everyone else who would otherwise have quit will continue playing, and many people who currently do not play because of the PvP switch will join.
<P>&gt; It will turn EQ
<BR>&gt; into a
<BR>&gt; wasteland of thugs, kewldoods, Mastah Killahs, and twelve
<BR>&gt; year-old
<BR>&gt; boys who aren't paying for it out of their own pockets.
<P>Other than the "not paying for it out of their own pockets" thing, this is erroneous. As said before, the wasteland of thugs, kewldoods, and Mastah Killahs are a direct result of poorly implemented systems. These people exist for one reason and one reason only, because the system REWARDS them for their actions. Either they get to loot you and keep your stuff without consequences, or they are given some kind of "status" reward by chalking up another kill. If the system works in the opposite direction, punishing these twits for their lack of restraint, poor manners, etc. then they will begin to straighten up. Kind of a virtual "grounding" for these juvenile miscreants. When the system ceases to reward abusers and starts to SERIOUSLY punish them - i.e., not just one or two nasty NPCs, but serious punishments, banishment from cities, poor reputation, etc.
<P>&gt; PvP is bad from a customer service standpoint because one side
<BR>&gt; wants it, the other doesnt -- who do you serve? Who do you make
<BR>&gt; your priority?
<P>You can serve both, believe it or not.
<P>On a final note, I would like to pose a question. If NPCs can be restricted to the point where you find it acceptable to be killed by them, why don't you believe that PCs could be similarly confined? It's not a matter of "Artificial intelligence." With the proper system, dying to a player would be just as uncommon, just as "fulfulling" and just as "fun" as meeting up with an NPC monster.
