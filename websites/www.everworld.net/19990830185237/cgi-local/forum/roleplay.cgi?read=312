<BR>(OOC/ I didn't realize that a weekend at my girlfriend's would put me back 80 posts! Please allow me to go back a little and catch up, I should be able to do it in a manner that won't upset the story...)
<P>Cynius wondered if he should move. The Erudite and the elven girl on the other end of the long boat hadn't noticed him all day, thanks to their sleeping, and he had wondered if he had made the right move by slipping on to this ship...
<P>Earlier, after his attempt to take on the lone guard (which seemed so long ago), he proved no match and was quickly subdued and rendered unconscious. When he came to, there were even more people on the boat than previously, and he recognized only the rogue that smelled of bad fish. At the sight of all the dead bodies of the guards, he knew he didn't not want to be caught up in something like that, so he snuck off the boat and began to swim for shore. On the way he spotted the long boat, and seeing the chance to take a free ride to Faydwer, he swam to it instead. As quiet as Cyn could be, sneaking aboard wasn't difficult. But upon close inspection he realized that the Erudite and girl were not a couple at all, but rather captor and captive... He decided that disrcetion was best, and remained hidden...
<P>But now, under the light of the moon, he could see that there was a more subtle relationship between the two... Maybe it was protector and ward rather than captor and captive. Cyn decided to chance a friendly greeting.
<P>"Hello, again, good couple!" He said cheerfully. The Erudite spun around in utter shock. Surely the half elf bard must have teleported there, there was no other way! The thin man began to mutter, and Cyn recognized a spell in the making.
<P>"Hold, good magician. I seek only passage to the lands of Faydwer. Let there be peace between us. I will not trouble you." Cynius held up his arms. The Erudite stopped, and appeared to be thinking for a bit. Cyn decided to push it. "In return for passage, I can entertain with song, and perhaps attend your lady and yourself, with any chores or errands that may need to be done."
<P>The Erudite studied him, assessing his character...
