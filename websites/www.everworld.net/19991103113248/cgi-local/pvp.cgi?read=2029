<P>I just wanted to wright this to state that what i used to think about race vs. race isnt the same way i feel today. At first i felt like it should definatly be race vs race in pvp combat, but now as my character is getting higher in level, i am seeing that this dont seem as important as it once did; when i was in my newbie levels. Now that im 18th i notice that alot of races are hanging together, hunting together, and alot are even in the same guild as one another. Which makes since, because as a dark elf there are no dark elf bards or druids, which are two very good classes to have in your group or guild, for that matter. When i was in the Nektolus forest hunting it was definatly taught that you should not attack the person in your on race, and even when i got a little higher and started hunting the east commons it was considered the same thing. Plus the Dark elf raids on Freeport was a blast. But as my character got higher in level theres was not much use to go on these raids because most of the people there was to low in level for me to attack. And from what i have seen for the most part once you get up there a bit in level its just not the big thing to do as it was when your character was younger.

<P>What im saying is currently the way the game is goin i feel that, only a few guilds will be real race conscience, and those few individuals who attack another race only to have a couple of there own race take there heads off, because they attacked someones guildmate even though they are a different race will realize that it isnt just about race vs. race.
<P>Now im not saying they should be big faction hits for the guilds who do have multi racial guilds, but i am sayin that the way it is right now i think that the big race wars, will be from like levels 1-14, then after that most pvp will be guild wars, and random pking. But at that point race wont be the issue. Is this a bad thing or not?
