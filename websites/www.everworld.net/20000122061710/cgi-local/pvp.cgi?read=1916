<P>In beta 3 I tested a ROGUE and accepted skills not being implemented and such. After Beta 3 I did not even attempt to test Beta 4 as I knew the Rogue would still be shafted in the skills area. BUT I did buy this game with the great anticipation of using and experiencing the full assortment of ROGUE skills and abilities that was sure to be implemented on the final release. I avidly re-read the user manual that came with my copy of the game and in wide eyed anticipation started the work on my ROGUE character.

<P>Most of these problems I have experienced some are from what I have seen discussed:
<BR>1. Hide/Sneak: does not help you get away from combat, it really should break targeting once you gain enough distance from your pursuer.
<BR>2. Pickpockets: does not work against other PvP players like what has always been advertised.
<BR>3. Safefall: is broken and does not keep you safe from falling damages like it did in beta 3.
<BR>4. Apply poison: has no fuction either broken or not enabled at all, most likely no code for it.
<BR>5. Make poison: no fuction either, broken, not enabled, or not even coded.
<BR>6. Sense Traps: no function, or broken, and What traps?
<BR>7. Disarm Traps: What traps?
<BR>8. Pick Locks: What locks? One lock in one dungeon????
<P>And since we dont have any thief skills that work, why are we limited in the armor we can wear??? SINCE our skills don't work, then our armor restrictions shouldn't be in effect either!!
<P>And indirectly: Shouldn't rogues be a bit faster on foot?? We have the highest agility and dexterity of any class except possibly the monk, why doesnt this "high agility and dexterity" equate to some increase in character speed?? Sure would be nice and logical, and give more substance to the ROGUE class and others with high agility and dexterity.
<P>Have I left many ROGUE skills out?? I think this is about 90-95% of the "Unique" skills that make up this class. The only other skills we get are generic skills that other classes get also, with the single exception being backstab. Other classes have dodge, parry, hide, sneak, safefall, etc, etc. The ROGUE currently is the MOST generic and UN specialized of ALL the character classes you can make.
<P>What about the even higher ROGUE skills? I am thinking there is nothing there coded or enabled either.
<P>Now I am totally disillusioned and disgusted by the state of the ROGUE classes skills. Nothing works the way it should except for Backstab. I have played a ROGUE in ever RPG I have ever played online or offline and this game has to be the ABSOLUTE worst implementation of the ROGUE class in my experience. Take this class completely out or FIX IT Verant this is still your responsibility and you OWE this to your paying customers.
