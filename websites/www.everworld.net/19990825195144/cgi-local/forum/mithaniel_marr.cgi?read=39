<P>Okay, so my skill in fletching skill has imporved nicely. Now I just need to sell some bows and arrows. The cost of making a nice bow is very high. I mean until you use at least an Elm bow, the bow doesn't seem like it is worth the time invested in gaining skill in archery. Hickery is ok (10 dam) but the 50 range is too short. ( you can just about kiss that grizzley before you can shoot.) So who whould pay 4 or 5 plat for the elm bow? I haven't found anyone yet. Now when I am able to make the Oak and better bows, at least I can tell people the damage I hit to make their mouth water. But wow is that oak expensive. over 17 plat for the staff alone. So again, who would pay 20 to 40 plat for an oak bow. Well I must try to incent people so here you go :

<P>Well, all I can say is that I am dedicated to the fletching proffesion. And I would like to get the people's interested in this great art. So.... here is the deal:
<P>1) Hickery bows will be given to anyone who wants one. Just send me a tell, and come and pick it up. There is one catch, I will ask you to purchase your arrows from only me. I will make any arrow you will like (for a price), and for that promise I will give you 10 point 1 arrows to start you archery carrer off for free.
<P>2) I will sell Elm bows at an EXTREEMLY good price: 13 dam, 51 delay, 75 range - 3plat 5gold I will make better quality bows on demand, but remember that better quality mean faster delay and less damage. example: carved elm bow is 12dam, 47delay, 75 range - and it cost 2plat more to make. I have used both, and the carved is better, but you must decide if it is worth the extra cost.
<P>3) Arrows at very good prices: I will be more than happy to make arrows of different variety for you. Class 2 bone point with 2 damage and 125 range is a very nice arrow and the lowest cost (5 silver) each. 3dam 125 range hooked bone arrows are going for (2gold) each. Please compare these prices to the arrows you can buy at the shop. This is VERY aggresive pricing. If I fail just a couple of times, I will lose money.
<P>Recomended techniques:
<P>Why fight with a bow:
<P>Can a warrior use any other weapon to draw a prey from far away, no How about doing 40-50 dam to a creature before melee. (stronger bows) think about the future. Rangers - try root or snare and hit with the bow will backing up if the creature is not fully frozen, I have done this very successfully getting in 30-80 damage before melee (and my archery is only 23)
<P>Well this is to generate some demand for my art, I hope to see you in Narrath. I can be in the Sure Fall Glade,
<P>Qeynos are usually.
<P>Good Travels,
<P>Algeran
