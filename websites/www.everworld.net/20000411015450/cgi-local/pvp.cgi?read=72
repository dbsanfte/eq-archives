<P>Well, as an extension of this idea, I was working on something on a MUD once where we were trying to enhance the guild war experience. Let me pitch this as if it were something already available. (even tho its not)

<P>A guild can buy a guild hall for a very LARGE sum of money. Only guild members could enter (this is done by either a lvl 50 guard which MUST be killed or hard coded into the game to allow only guildmates to enter) which would then allow the guildmates to enter their guildhouse as if it were a seperate zone(you know.. zone into the guildhouse.) Where the guild could buy stuff to put into the guildhouse (IE: Chairs, tables, etc..). Also have a guild NPC. This NPC would be the Flag holder. Other warring guilds would need to break into the guild by killing the main guard NPC. Once inside they would need to fight all other guildmemebers of the guildhouse as well as kill the NPC with the flag. When a warring guild attacks the guild guard, the guild would yell over the guilds chat that their guildhouse is under attack, thus summoning a call for help to all guildmates.
<P>If a guild was successful in capturing the flag, it would render the guildhouse unusable/enterable for a specific amount of time.. lets say 1day-3days? A big inconvenience to some who have their stuff inside the guild house as well as the dishonor of losing your guildhouse.
<P>Some factors.. Only guild members can attack guild guards (eliminating the random 20 people which are not affiliated with any guild who happen to pass by and wanna do something so they assist a weak guild & kill it) Also guildhouses can only be attacked within a 12 hour time period chosen by the guild that owns it. IE: guild A assigns attackble time to 12pm to 12am. Thus eliminating the 4am raid when nobody is on.
<P>Well, just a pitch in case you wanna use some of it.
