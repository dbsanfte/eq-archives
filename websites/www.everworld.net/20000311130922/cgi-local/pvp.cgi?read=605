<P>ohh god last one this is entertaining me, you know that right :) you are making my workday fun :P

<P>ok dokie to respond last 1 I swear....but u left yourself wide open to be flamed on this one :P
<P>&gt; OMG man you are stupid, do you think anyone is going to openly
<BR>&gt; admit that they think someone was a god. Nope, I know I
<BR>&gt; wouldn't. Plus I seriously feel sorry for you int he fact that
<BR>&gt; you can't seperate reality from a video game. Me saying I was a
<BR>&gt; god in a video game has no bearing on real life.
<P>where in my post does it refer to real life in any way shape or form... you could be a really nice guy but this is a game board...and you talk much shit about a game you never really played except the bug filled beta that everyone Pked their asses off in....I mearly took offence to you post below on the I was GOD statement in UO when I who played beta also and (I dont claim any fame whatsoever) know we Pked just as much as anyone else.. including (bleh I guess you, but i still havent got but 1 beta person to even admit you existed) but for sure the so called Great Hobbes.
<P>&gt; SHARD!!! Enough said... You can keep your lame UO fame... UO is
<BR>&gt; in the PAST, the sooner you get that through your head the
<BR>&gt; better off you are. If you hadnt started this stupid flaming war
<BR>&gt; I never would have even talked about UO. I was only using it as
<BR>&gt; an example.
<P>Bleh do you have a learning disorder like no reading comprehension?
<BR>you dont understand the posts at all
<BR>you could mearly have said ok mayby Im not exactly the UO god, but i was good :P
<BR>dispite what you say here you were not the founding PKs in Beta we all were beta Pks and pretty darn good ones at that,
<BR>I started the post becasue you cant in a game or real life go around saying shit like that and not expect flat out laughter...
<BR>that is mearly the points of these pointless posts id much rather flame that other guy that was flaming you at least u were smart enough to survive UO where that miserable excuse couldnt even survive and whines about it...
<BR>at least you hold the same oppinions on the games EQ and UO PvPs points that i do.
