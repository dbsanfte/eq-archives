<P>Chapter IX by Dauthi

<P>Pigorsh could not bring himself to break contact to the rune, he almost could unerstand it! The whispers became closer and louder, as pigorsh began to understand what they were saying
<BR>Turn bacccchh....You can’ot w’in........
<BR>Then the gnome began to splutter and choke, felling wet and VERY grumpy.
<BR>“WHAT DIDJA DO THAT FER WOMAN?” he yelled.
<BR>“You weren’t breathing...I’m sorry!” E’gail said, rising in tone. “You could stand to be nicer you know! First you treat Glodain like a piece of dung, and then when I think you’re dying and try to help, you begin to yell at me! Stupid, unthinking gnome!” She was on the verge of tears now, and turned away.
<BR>“Um...I...” Pigorsh began to say, and stopped himself. Who was she to yell at him!? He wasn’t going to apologize! Never!
<BR>Never...
<BR>“I’m sorry ‘Gail...S’just I was so involved with the artifact I lost my temper....” Then he quickly walked back to where he was, and began studying the rune again. And grumpier than before, mumbling every curse he knew.
<BR>Despite her tries, she could not get him to speak to her for quite some time.
<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>Dauthi walked through the forest, whistling a tune he knew and using his voice to encourage the birds to sing with him.
<BR>He had just come from a Royal court a week ago, and his pocket was as full as it ever had been. 150 gold was a lot for Dauthi! Now he was on his way to a wood elf village (he couldn’t pronounce the name) to see if he could get a little more before returning to the human town.
<P>He made a small whistle and a bird landed on his shoulder. “Ahh,” he thought, “ nothing like being a bard with a bit of magic music.”
<P>Dauthi had been Bardic Gifted since he was 4. He had been sent to a Bardic Collegium when he was 5, and discovered to have the Bardic Gift of...Well, magic! ‘Twas not like a wizard’s or cleric’s magic...Somehow different.
<BR>He was 5’8, with long, dirty blonde hair, with a common tunic and pants. He wore a short sword on his side, a dagger in his right boot, and a lute across his back.
<BR>There was a noise up ahead. Dauthi hid behind a bush, wishing to see who was coming.
<BR>He saw 4 people traveling a horse back, a woman with 3 men. How he envied those men! Give him a few minutes to charm the lovely (without magic of course, he was honorable!) and.....
<BR>Wait...was the woman tied to her horse? He moved behind them for a ways and discovered that yes, she was. Guarding (jailing?) her were a couple of men in standard mercenary clothing....And an odd man with fiery red hair. He dashed behind the cover of the trees to get ahead of them, which was no hard matter since they were only trotting.
<BR>He put his back to a tree, willing himself to not seem to be there, all the while whistling a tune with a voice like a bird’s. Shouldn’t be seen now, unless they looked very closely at where he was.
<BR>He continued to whistle while studying the men. Hmmm, where’d the redhead go? He stopped whistling for a moment...
<BR>And was lifted off the ground by his throat, which wasn’t very good by his standards!
<BR>“And who might you be?” questioned the unseen man.
<BR>Dauthi gasped “W cough would be easier gasp ta ‘tlk if you weren’t choking me l’d!!!”
<BR>He loosened his grip. “Now,” asked the man, whom he now identified as the fire haired one, “who are you?” His voice was cold as ice.
<BR>Dauthi gasped for air, and once he had enough, settled himself to a calm and answered “I am Dauthi, Full bard and singster! And you?” He bowed.
<BR>“I am...You may call me Crimson Sun...what are you doing spying on my men???”
<BR>“And you you mean? I was curious, as any bard is!”
<BR>“No...I do not trust you...turn around!” he ordered.
<BR>“Ok, but I don’t see what the probl...ERK!” and his world went dark.
<P>“Ohhh my aching, achin head..” he muttered...
<BR>He opened his eyes and immediatly closed them again. Oh, mage lights were too damn bright! He cracked his eyelids slightly open to survey his surroundings.
<BR>He was on the back of a horse, laying across it...But why on earth was he on the back end instead of the saddle?
<BR>Oh, of course, they strapped him behind the girl he had seen.
<BR>He whispered softly, so only the girl would hear him, “Now what’s a pretty young lady like you doing with these ruffians when you could be having your way with any man he chose?” he chuckled when she turned and he could see the look on her face.
<BR>“I thought you were dead!”
<BR>“He might be if he does not tell me what I want to know and do as i asked!”
<BR>Sigh thought Dauthi, *I get to be training pellet again...”
