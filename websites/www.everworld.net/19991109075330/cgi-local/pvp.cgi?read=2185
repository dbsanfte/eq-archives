<P>that sounds about as smart as making Rallos Zek a blue server.

<P>jesus when will you people who whine and moan go to carebear servers where you belong? if you can't take it..
<BR>get the f^ck off and go somewhere where you won't have to change the world to fit YOUR style of playing and
<BR>make EVERYONE ELSE unhappy.
<P>how to fix the stupid system: well in this case it can't really be fixed, because this is how most PKing works
<BR>(I've done hard core PK'ing in two other very popular online games - UO and Diablo - for the past 3 years or so).
<BR>You wait until someone is vulnerable, then you wax them. it just happens that spellcasters are best for this job,
<BR>so they are always the ones who get jumped on for being "too powerful." realize that it is just as easy for a Cleric
<BR>to Root or Blind a caster while he is fighting a monster and then wait until the monster has the caster down to
<BR>low health. realize that ANY class except for Warriors (well Warriors CAN use Archery to chase down and kill
<BR>someone low on health) can do this, by various means. also realize that you are playing in a cutthroat society,
<BR>where you MAY get killed at any point. IF YOU WANT TO NOT BE ATTACKED WHILE VULNERABLE OR FIGHTING
<BR>A MOB THEN *DO NOT* I REPEAT *DO NOT* PLAY ON RALLOS ZEK. IT IS THE FATE OF EVERYONE TO DIE AT SOME
<BR>POINT IN THEIR CAREER ON THIS SERVER TO THIS SORT OF THING. IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. IT HAS HAPPEND TO
<BR>MY FRIENDS - IT *WILL* HAPPEN TO YOU. It also has happened in every single online game I've ever played - just
<BR>like it happens in real life. when do thugs attack you? when you are in a dark alley, alone, and when they have
<BR>superior numbers. DO you go out in the night with expensive clothing and $10,000 in your pocket into a KNOWN
<BR>dangerous neighborhood or situation (dark alley)? DO YOU? are you really that stupid? well think the same while
<BR>playing on Rallos Zek. don't get your ass into tight situations (fighting multiple mobs alone in a dungeon or with
<BR>a weak/small group with no healer), and ALWAYS, ALWAYS be looking around you. circle the monster you are
<BR>fighting while you fight it so you can get a view all around you. THAT is how you survive on this server - by playing
<BR>it smart.
<P>ok that was long but you get the point... I HOPE
