<P>

<BR>Over the course of several months some things have been made clear to us by 989, while others we've developed a sense of understanding about what and how far 989 will go to accomodate changes. The PvP switch is one area where there is no room for change, it's a voluntary system and we're stuck with it. A second assumption I am operating under is that 989 will not develop a custom code base that is seperate from the main code base (i.e. a 2nd game) to accomodate PvP. Other areas might be more flexibile.
<P>Right now we are faced with EQ going to gold press CD in the near future, and the eventual re-assignment of dev team members onto new projects as EQ becomes Final in March. Whatever changes can be made probably need to come about soon, and cannot be too revolutionary or major code rewrites. Although ideas are great, we have to temper ourselves and realize that this game is almost released. Discussing what if scerio's about how 989 could have designed the game in our idea of a perfect world is ok for philisophical discourse but won't make it into the product.
<P>Lets be realistic about what we can expect and try to prioritize the main issues and try to focus attention onto those areas that give us the best results overall and have a chance of being implemented in the near future as opposed to Everquest II.
<P>&gt; Thanks for you polite post. However you are assuming to much.
<BR>&gt; Your first assumption is that the prior posters all have first
<BR>&gt; hand experience with UO. I personally have never played it and
<BR>&gt; don't know how any systems work within that game. Secondly it
<BR>&gt; sounds to me like you are assuming that new systems can not be
<BR>&gt; introduced into this game. My understanding of this area is that
<BR>&gt; we are encouraged to post ideas that we think will enhance the
<BR>&gt; game with accordance to the topic suggested. I strongly believe
<BR>&gt; that these post are very relevant to game play and how people
<BR>&gt; would like to see it work with regards to the topic suggested.
<BR>&gt; Finally, this further emphasis's my idea that along with each
<BR>&gt; topic suggested their should be a current description of how the
<BR>&gt; topic is currently handled by the game. Thus keeping us more
<BR>&gt; focused on the topic.
