<P>> I debate game system ineffectiveness, and you bring up specific

<BR>&gt; scenarios in an attempt to somehow make me lose face in front of
<BR>&gt; people I don't know?
<P>No, actually you more than did enough to make yerself look like a fool in front of everyone.
<P>If yer little mind could keep track of a point for more than a second, you would see that I brought up the initial post that addresses a problem. And you, in a feeble attempt, tried to say I dont understand the mechanics of the game; A game I've been playing since phase .5. While the other people responding to my post brought up valid and useful points, you decided that you would personally try (albeit a usual failed attempt) to make it sound like I had no idea what I was talking about.
<P>&gt; Yes, it is possible
<BR>&gt; to kill tombstone players (btw, how were we both tombstone when
<BR>&gt; Crys was 2 levels my junior?)
<P>Well, let me explain EQ to you a bit. You see, if I am level 6, and you and crys are at least 2 levels higher than me, even tho crys is 2 levels less than you, you would both be tombstone in most circumstances. Got it, chump?
<P>&gt; a bit defensive. You see, people without such defense mechanisms
<BR>&gt; can discuss PvP scenarios without resorting to direct insults,
<BR>&gt; lies, and egocentric assumptions. If you would like to discuss
<P>You are the defensive one. You brought the flames on first. Maybe yer little mind forgot what you originally posted. Take a looksie.
<P>Bye the way, congrats on moving up to 4 syllable words. Those hooked on phonics really worked, eh?
<P>&gt; Removing level restrictions is
<BR>&gt; simply too unrealistic in a system where your power is SET by
<BR>&gt; your level in relation to another player's. Yes, it is possible
<BR>&gt; to kill tombstone players
<P>You missed my entire point. Again, I cant say this enough. REREAD MY POST. I'm not about to type it out all for you again, when you should have read it in the first place.
<P>&gt; when the odds are 4 to 1, and the
<BR>&gt; victim logs IN rooted before he can become aware he has entered
<BR>&gt; the game.
<P>I hope you are not pretending that we rooted her, when she was tomb to us, or that she logged in rooted. Dont even try to spread these lies.
<P>&gt;The simple fact of the matter is EQ's
<BR>&gt; "adaptation" of PvP is unwieldy because it is a PvE
<BR>&gt; system that happens to support one player attacking another,
<P>And Englands government happened to support Kings and Queens and paying taxes, so all the people that formed America should have just given into it, and had a monarchy in the states? Pfffft, you see, UO did NOT listen to it's beta testers or customers at all. EQ on the other hand had taken many valid points and made it part of the game. It's impossible for a small team of developers to decide everything for thousands of customers. It's a common business practice, in all forms of business. Maybe when ya grow up, you'll learn a bit about the world.
<P>&gt; much like a player soloing a mob; this by no means makes it
<BR>&gt; realistic or interesting.
<P>So, dont play the PvP shard. Me, I'm trying to improve and polish what I see as a game with GREAT PvP potential. So have fun Mr. PvEer.
<P>&gt;Granted, if they come up with a more
<BR>&gt; viable solution to the problems you encounter with tombstones
<BR>&gt; being difficult to hit and overly resisting spells (which
<BR>&gt; requires a complete re-code of the combat system for a PvP port)
<P>It doesnt require "a complete re-code". Many a suggestion has been given to this which could easily be done without a complete re-code. Example, table based, or half the current system level requirements.
<P>I want dinner on the table when I get home Theo,
<P>-=Leoric - will they ever learn?
