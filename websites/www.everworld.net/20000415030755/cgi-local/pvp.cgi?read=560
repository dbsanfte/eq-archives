<P>I dunno who this guy thinks he is, but Id say hes got a serious Superiority complex that is all in his head. I have also been in UO since day one and I still play a Chaos and red Pk today. I have heard many things about Hobbes but not 1 word about this so called

<BR>"God" LOL just saying it makes me laugh teehee :P
<BR>I dunno where he gets off calling all the other true Pks from UO lamer wannabes but since hes the one that is no longer on UO I would have to say that you are the quitter lamer that should not be running his mouth anywhere including hideing in an EQ board such as this.
<BR>To be honest I have been on GL since the day after final started and Hobbes is the only truely famous PvP char anyone even remembers or says 1 word about. GL and Atlantic were the only 2 TRUE PvP shards in UO and SiN has played and owned both servers at differenrt points of time GL is our home and we still lay claim to it noone can touch us as the Motivating Chaos\PK guild. by the way, back in the days u were famous any idiot could PK tons of people I know i was there from the days of insta kill fireballs and Harm and other cheap PvP imbalances. so unless you are a god on UO now dont run your damn mouth today UO is 90% melee for PvP since everyone has 100 resist and healing anotomy mages are just balancing chars. I would challenge you anyday in UO 1 on 1 with your original char Vs. my current 5 way Gm townfighter. on the EQ side I must say in between your stupid and ignorant UO rambling you are on the Money. EQ NEEDS the same type of danger element that true rampant PvP allows. I was Pked as a newbie and you know what it feels bad, but until its gone you dont realaize what a rush it is to know there is other dangers around. plus if the damn "goodie Goodie" RPs would travel in well diciplined groups u dont have to worry about "gangbangs" becasue everyone in the group will take one of the PKs on and it becomes a huge 1 on 1 battle but the goodie goodies seem to always travel alone or with lamers that recall or run the first red name they see therefore causeing the unbalanced gangrape affect on the true fighters that try to stay.
<BR>its not the Pks or PvPs fault that the "good" guys never can fight or have the organizeation of the Pks or PvPs. The truth is alot of the successful PvP guilds have RL military leaders that are useing tactics learned in the military which makes us with our "superior" chars and communication unbeatable in affect.
<BR>so to all yall RPs or goodie goodie PvP chars its not us exploiting its yalls own fault you get gangbanged in UO or EQ or wherever you play.look at you members and freinds and blame them for running casue they would rather have the 10k or 5 plat they just made off a lame creature and to leave you there to fight on uneven odds
<BR>than to have the glory and the feeling they fought with teamwork and possibly won against the Evil Pks. I know this is very possible since at one point I was in a very good antiPK guild that could hang with any Red Pk guild we had numbers and all of us were over 20 years old and fought as a tight military unit. Our leader was a 10 year Army Ranger Sargeant with actaul war deploys under his belt. Most of the members were all ex military from different branches and we worked fantastic as a team. So that goes to show you that PvP is not imbalanced its just in who is on Evil or Good sides and how they play as parties. Its not our fault a single Blue RP walks into ambush point that was set for a much larger Anti guild to walk into but thats how all the good guys feel when they get raped that we were there to kill the newbies or the solos when in fatch they had stubled upon a warzone and became the causulty. well enough of this infernal rant... Whitewolf flame if you want but i give a nats butt what you think I was and still am there. and you arnt but instead u in here running you mouth over long forgotten deeds... CV-SiN
