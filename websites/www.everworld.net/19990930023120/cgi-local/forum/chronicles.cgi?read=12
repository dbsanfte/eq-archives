<P>Chapter III by Cathal

<BR>The orc was looking directly at Pigorsh, grinning derisively. It growled in its guttural voice as it held the axe over the little elven maiden. “You move and these die!”
<BR>Pigorsh unfortunately had both hands in the shaman’s pack, like a little child caught with its hands in a cookie jar. Pigorsh often wondered at his own motives in situations like this. He also wondered why he more often than not found himself in such embarrassing positions. Why, for example, had he joyfully dashed over to the dead shaman and started rooting through his belongings without a second thought to his friend Glodain. Must just be some sort of ‘character flaw’ he thought. Or maybe brain damage, maybe he was dropped on his head when a wee gnomeling. Whatever the cause it didn’t help with the current set of circumstances.
<BR>Pigorsh couldn’t twitch his nose and cast wizard’s fire; he just wasn’t that talented. And he wouldn’t be quick enough to turn and throw the wizards fire before one of his companions would die. Fortunately, Pigorsh thought, the orc was standing directly over the little inept elven maiden. He would incinerate the orc. If he were quick enough he might be able to do it before the orc could cleave the elf in two. If not, well then, that’s the way it would have to be she wasn’t his concern after all. One thing of concern to Pigorsh however was the way Glodain had acted. Glodain was one of the best fighters Pigorsh had ever seen. Normally Glodain could have taken care of all the orcs himself once the shaman was out of the way and Pigorsh had taken care of the shaman. His friend however had not been himself since he found the maiden and mistook her for his sister. His brain had gone mushy on him. Glodain carried some deep pain and wounds with him and Pigorsh was loath to bring more sorrow to his friend. For Glodain truly was his friend. He required nothing from Pigorsh for this friendship and Pigorsh new he would lay down his life protecting him, Pigorsh felt the same way. Pigorsh thought that maybe he should try a little harder to save the girl.
<BR>“Yer just nothin’ but a stupid troll? What do I care for that little flop? Go ahead and chop her up, I don’t give a rats arse.”
<BR>“I AIN’T NO TROLL you blind little imp!”
<BR>Now Pigorsh was really getting mad. The stupid orc had called him an imp. He would show it. Pigorsh had slowly been taking his hands out of the pack and turning around so as to be facing the orc. He would fry it. Maybe just one more good insult or two and he would distract the orc enough to let loose with his wizards fire. Just as he was beginning to grin to himself he heard a snap in the woods beyond. The orc turned and looked also.
<BR>Several rough looking men clad in mail with every conceivable weapon bristling over their muscular frames came out of the woods along with some more orcs. The man who seemed to be in charge looked around in disgust, rage distorting his features. Pigorsh had stood when the others arrived and the orc with the axe looked around at them. Pigorsh now knew the orc was stalling and was waiting for his companions to show up. He also made a mental note not to assume orcs were all that dumb from now on. Pigorsh was also wondering if he could fight this many and was thinking maybe a simple panicked running escape might be in order when the leader spoke.
<BR>“Make one move my little wizard and you will be dancing with the spirits, and maybe for me as well”. The leader chuckled. The way he grinned and especially the gleam in his eyes made the sparse hair on the back of Pigorsh’s neck stand out. Fear gripped the gnome, this man was mad and enjoyed being mad. The gnome felt frozen, it seemed as if he couldn’t will his legs to run. The leader made a motion with his hands and Pigorsh immediately fell to his knees, with his life seemingly to flow from him. He became week and dizzy but managed to remain conscious.
<BR>“What in the name of the dead happened here?” the leader bellowed at the large orc. “You stupid son of a salamander, I give you a simple task and you manage to get your whole squad killed including that worthless shaman. What’s wrong with you? SAY SOMETHING before I make you wish you were never born”.
<BR>The orc mumbled something while shaking like a leaf as the leader marched over to him. He looked down at the girl and pulled her partially up by the hair, blood dripping from the wound on the side of her head. “This isn’t even the right one”. He ground out to the orc, as he was barely able to hold his temper. “I don’t have time for this, the one we seek will be passing this way soon and if we lose her you will all pay.” He shouted at his men as he let the girl drop.
<BR>“You two” the leader said to a couple of his men “finish these three off and catch up with us, I don’t dare waste any more time with this nonsense, that enchantress will be passing by any time! We mustn’t miss her”!
<BR>With that the man with the flame red hair marched off with his men in tow. Pigorsh was queasy and didn’t seem to have control over his magic. Glodain was slowly shaking his head, trying to fight for consciousness as the two mercenaries each wearing a wicked grin and pulling long sharp curved knives from their belts started marching over to them.
<BR>“We’ll save her for last” the one said to his companion with a smirk. Pigorsh actually felt sorry for the little elf, he was at least reasonably sure he would die quickly...
