<P>The Emerald Covenant Reborne!

<P>Greetings Fellow Adventurers,
<P>I bring you news of an event which has transpired in the last several weeks. The Emerald
<BR>Covenant, a guild which was originally intended to be based on the Rallos Zek( PVP )
<BR>server, has been reborne. A growing group of fellow adventurers and I have decided that
<BR>PVP in EverQuest was never meant to be, and is not what we expected or want any
<BR>longer. Consequently, when the next new server opens its doors, we are all going to
<BR>pick up and make our home there, getting a fresh start with fresh players. We are looking
<BR>for prospective members, those who wish also to leave behind the burden of the
<BR>slowly decaying and already decadent PVP server, those who are on other servers and
<BR>would like to switch for the opportunity to take part in the creation of a great group of
<BR>players and an incredible guild, or even those just starting out in search of mentors to
<BR>help you on your way in the world. Our main goals and objectives remain what they
<BR>were before the release of the commercial version of EverQuest; namely the promotion
<BR>of an interwoven roleplaying environment, intense cooperation and organization among
<BR>members, extensive exploration of new dungeons, areas, and quests, and most importantly
<BR>the desire to use our numbers to encourage positive changes to the world of EverQuest.
<BR>If you think you might be interested in joining, please feel free to send me email at
<BR>the address listed below. If you have any questions or comments, or just want more
<BR>information, you can also contact me. So, in short, if you think you might want to get
<BR>a fresh start with a fresh group of players and get off on the right foot in a tightly
<BR>bound group of dedicated adventurers, The Emerald Covenant might be what you
<BR>are looking for!
<P>Hail and Goodhunt,
<BR>Mustapha Kentaro <Emerald Covenant>
