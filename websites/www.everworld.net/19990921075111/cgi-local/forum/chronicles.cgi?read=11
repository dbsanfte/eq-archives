<P>Chapter II by Spiro

<BR>This outburst caused E’gaile to jump. She had not been listening to their conversation and, in fact, her attention had been solely consumed by her food. Now that she had been brought back to the world of the living, she looked around. That was when she saw a piggish snout and a pair of beady yellow eyes behind the gnome and elf. Following her first instinct, she screamed.
<BR>The two looked up from their conversations with question on their faces. Had she been a second later they never would have had time to react. Five orcs charged out of the woods. Glodain was still looking at E’gaile when Pigorsh suddenly jumped across him. He was quickly replaced by a great sabre half again the size of the small gnome. In a flash Glodain grabbed for his sword; with little more than a twitch of his hand the sabre lay on the ground with the limp remains of the orcs arm still attached. Two orcs charged at Glodain, but he was on his feet and waiting for them, having already dispatched his last adversary. Before the two even reached him, a sizable hole had appeared in the closest, and the other was missing its head before the first hit the ground. With astonishment Glodain whirled around to see Pigorsh standing on a stump, a broad smile on his face, and smoke trailing from his fingers.
<BR>“What do ya think your looking at, go help the girl, do I have to do every friggin thing around here. Get your ass moving.” After seeing the orcs Glodain had forgotten about E’gaile. He spun quickly on his foot to see where she was. All he saw before the fireworks were two orcs charging for a tree and the last orc, all in robes, standing on the far side of the clearing, deep in concentration. Pigorsh had a better view, he saw the girl backing up against the tree, he was about to send some fireballs the orcs way, when he saw the girl make some intricate movements with here arms and hands. “She’s a wizard!?!” He spouted in astonishment, “Well don’t that beat...” Before he could finish his statement she finished, but with a rather large frown on her face. Suddenly the whole ground began to shake, enormous fissures broke out all over the clearing, fire burst forth with intense rage. The smaller of the two orcs charging E’gaile was ash before any of them could even comprehend what had just happened.
<BR>“She’s a friggin numbskull.”
<BR>Glodain had long since started ignoring the grumpy gnome’s complaints. With incredible ease he leapt up to the lowest branch of a nearby tree, and started running among the trees to get to E’gaile. Seeing she had gained some time with her blunder she started concentrating on a new spell, she should really get rid of the fire so it would be easier to kill the remaining orcs. Pigorsh began looking through his clothes, trying to find anything that might have some resistance to fire. He thought to himself, since there was no one to yell at, “I was hoping for a bit more heat tonight, but this is friggin ridiculous.”
<BR>Glodain fell from the trees just a few feet from E’gaile, who was leafing intently through her book of magic. The largest orc, and only one remaining who could still fight, began, systematically finding the smallest and weakest tongues of flame, leaping his way towards his prey. Tears began falling is droves from E’gaile’s eyes, “I can’t find it, I can’t find it. I don’t have a spell to stop this.” She dropped the book to the ground, just as it hit the dirt the flames started to waver, billows of steam began to shoot from the fissures. The two elves stared at the book in disbelief, Glodain raised his sword, knowing the large orc would not be far behind. When the steam stopped rising he didn’t see the large orc anywhere, what he saw was the orc in robes, ten feet off the ground, his eyes glowing brighter then the sun.
<BR>The orc began to chant in a horrible tongue, Glodain didn’t know what to expect, so he continued searching for the large orc. Pigorsh and E’gaile both ran for some type of cover almost in unison. Just as the bad tempered gnome jumped into a large hole under a tree, the lightning started. A bolt struck a foot from Glodain’s forward most toe, he was thrown straight across the clearing. Their entire campsite was turned to rubble, and E’gaile’s book had been blown in half, but strangely enough none of the pages had burned. Pigorsh leapt from his hiding place, fire in his eyes.
<BR>“You friggin bastard, you burnt up MY PACK!” He screamed at the orc shaman. The shaman still deep in concentration never had a chance to react as wave after wave icy knives struck at him.
<BR>E’gaile pulled herself out of the crevice she had leapt into. The first thing she saw was Glodain bent in a strange manner next to a tree, and bleeding all over. She ran to him, not knowing what to do. She screamed out to the gnome. “Little Pigorsh, come quickly come help, Glodain is hur..”
<BR>Her plea was cut short as a hand bigger then her skull, rapped around her face. The last thing that went through her head was the pain of having it rammed into the ground.
<BR>Pigorsh quite pleased with the things he found on the dead shaman looked up as he heard the foolish girl call for his help. What he saw chilled him to the bone. A bloody and burnt orc three times his height, and many times his weight, standing over the limp bodies of both Glodain and E’gaile. He had horrid grin on his face, and a huge axe raised over his head.
