<P>I hope it never becomes like UO, where you have to do nothing to achieve godlike status. It is completely and totally pathetic to be able to macro for a couple days and be maxed out in every playable stat and skill. While the current level system in EQ still has flaws when it comes to PvP, it is still better than that mess in UO.

<P>Now I'm not saying that these problems with being as limited to who you can kill becuase of levels is right. I'm just saying that every other aspect of the game can't and should not be ignored for the sake of PvP. I mean come on, in UO you didn't need to kill a single monster for anything. They were like speed bumps to us...annoying but there. I'm sure there is a middle ground with this level restrictions thing, we just need time to work it out.
<P>I would propose a slightly wider gap, at least say 6 levels instead of the present setup. Part of the PvP experience is escape and evade, not just fighting it out. level advancment will mean something when you are at risk more from other players. It will also promote real grouping and player loyalty to eachother. Sure ti will be tough to solo, as it should be. I find that playing with my friends and guildmates is what makes the game for me. Anyway, there is a middle ground....we just need to find it. Verant will always consider any reasi\onable requests, as they have by allowing for a PvP server. If you older testers remember the PvP server issue was a deletable offence on the general message beta board for a very long time. We took our time and swayed them our side. If we can do that, we can do anything. Just my opinio, and as Dennis Miller says "I could be wrong" =P
