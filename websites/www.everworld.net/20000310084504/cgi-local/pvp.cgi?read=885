<P>Well PvP doesn't have a bright light at the end of the tunnel. Why? because nothing is being done about the existing problems. With release on March 16th and the amount of things that need to be changed and >won't< be changed(ill talk about this in a min) I don't see PvP surviving in eq. What with the levels being way more powerful than anyone 1 level below them, group PvP, the fact that I talked with a very high up gm (not namin names here) and he said that they think the +-4 level limit is fair and they like it, and the horrible turnout of the PvP server. WE , yes US have to do something here. In phase 3 I organized a pvp meeting of about 20 pk's and a gm.(there were only 20 pks on the server anyways:P ) In this we came up with the idea of the sundering, which in my opinion was a success and the faction drop if killing your own kind. Small step for pking but a giant step for pking kind. My point is WE need to get another meeting badly! They just arent responding to this message board, sad but true. All of us need to come up with a plan and let me be the first to throw one out. A few members of the board here /petition some gm's and tell them to visit each of the zones on the pvp server throughout the day and take suggestions and opinions AND dissaprovals <--- of the way it is now. When they find out just how many( well i shouldnt say the word many when im talking of the number of ppl on the pvp server) of us dont like the way it is. We cant all /petition a gm here but we DESERVE some time from them as we are all spending hours testing it and posting here and it seems they are doing nothing. We can't have a huge pk meeting in a chat room because in that 20 man meeting it was harder then hell to have someone read your txt cause everyone was typin there suggestions, so in a 100 man chat room well you know:).If you read this please post further suggestions of how to get there attention, or anything else helpful. I have a dream!....

<P>Novandamis, I too had relations with Monica Lewinsky and I'd like to apologize to you the american public and my wife and child :(
