<P>

<BR>After level X a simple removal of the level limit? Once you hit level... uh 20?... you are simply a target for everyone 16th and up. This rids the newbie killing stuff and allows for those long brawling battles and raids ("Damn, that 26th level Necro is cleaning our cleric's clock! Maybe the six of us together can take him!"), I've always wanted to see how a level 30 Necromancer would do against 6 level 16's or something like that. Basically at that point you aren't a newbie killer and you've developed some sort of maturity to get that far. You should be smart enough to choose battles you can win and you should be able to pick a fight with anyone you want. Conversely, you should also be strong enough to get away if need be as well. You might start wondering what stops a level 40 guy from camping at EC or someplace and just killing any level 20s he sees. Well, the same thing that stops a level 5 newbie killer from doing it, people police their own.
<P>You are always going to have "lusers" that don't want to play by the rules and they just derive some pathetic fun out of slaughtering people that can't fight back. In almost every case there was an equal and opposite reaction that kept these people down. I also believe that since Everquest makes leveling a long and involved process, most lusers won't get this far. But you never know.
<P>&gt; I think the biggest problem for PvP is the one not addressed
<BR>&gt; here, and that's some sort of balancing act between the classes.
<BR>&gt; Let me just start by saying I'm NOT in favor of complete
<BR>&gt; equality between the classes in a PvP fight by any means. There
<BR>&gt; are, however, some problems with the way the game works that
<BR>&gt; give melee classes an undue hardship, the primary one being the
<BR>&gt; way melee combat works. Stereotypically, in an RPG, if a mage
<BR>&gt; can stay way way back and pelt the warriors with spells, the
<BR>&gt; high level mage reigns supreme. But get him in close quarters
<BR>&gt; and he gets torn to pieces. The problem EQ has with that is the
<BR>&gt; difficulty in keeping someone close enough but not too close
<BR>&gt; that you can't see them (and keeping them in front of you.) It's
<BR>&gt; especially hard when you're going after someone and they
<BR>&gt; suddently 'teleport' 10 feet ahead just as you're about to
<BR>&gt; swing. Something should be done to rectify the situation. Maybe
<BR>&gt; widen melee range a little bit.
<P>&gt; Some notes on root below, but other than it being a little too
<BR>&gt; powerful, I don't see the problem with it.. Certiainly don't
<BR>&gt; think it's duration should be shortened ONLY for PCs. I do think
<BR>&gt; that Channel is too good. In my limited (16th level) experience
<BR>&gt; with it, I think it goes off far too often, allowing you to
<BR>&gt; continue casting a lot more than it should. I can only imagine
<BR>&gt; what happens when you have it in the high 3 digits. Casters just
<BR>&gt; should not be able to handle themselves in melee with warriors.
<BR>&gt; If they want to gate out the least they should have to do is try
<BR>&gt; for one of those roots and back off to gate instead of being
<BR>&gt; able to stand there for 10 seconds while the gate casts and the
<BR>&gt; warrior pounds them and they channel on through with a smile.
<P>&gt; Bear in mind that the rest of these comments are based around
<BR>&gt; the assumption (no matter how misguided) that someday, melee
<BR>&gt; types will get a little tweak so all that armor and all those
<BR>&gt; weapons they lug around become something more than loot for the
<BR>&gt; rooters.
<P>&gt; I wouldn't say there's universal support for removing /con
<BR>&gt; against other players. If there's going to be an immersive
<BR>&gt; world, I don't think any particular spell, skill, command, etc.
<BR>&gt; should work differently for monsters and players. Now if /con
<BR>&gt; were removed altogether that would be fine. I personally don't
<BR>&gt; see how the characters in game would have some sort of sixth
<BR>&gt; sense allowing them to determine how tough a particular creature
<BR>&gt; is just by watching it walk/slither/fly across the landscape. If
<BR>&gt; you look at a level 25 goblin and a level 9 troll npc, I'm
<BR>&gt; thinking the troll's going to look a little tougher even though
<BR>&gt; the goblin would mop the floor with it. Same would typically go
<BR>&gt; for a human pc versus an ogre pc, just going on looks and
<BR>&gt; assuming no chance to watch either of them in a fight or
<BR>&gt; otherwise using their skills.
<P>&gt; A lot of the reasoning I've seen behind removing /con for PvP is
<BR>&gt; that it will make people think more about jumping someone.
<BR>&gt; Removing /con entirely does the same thing but on a broader
<BR>&gt; level. Makes you think a lot more about jumping on anything.
<BR>&gt; Now, not saying I'm completely in favor of this, just that I'm
<BR>&gt; not in favor of removing it ONLY for PvP.
<P>&gt; On a similar note, I don't think any spells should be altered to
<BR>&gt; affect PCs one way and NPCs another. Root is the one that people
<BR>&gt; raise the hue and cry over. I agree it's a little too powerful,
<BR>&gt; but reducing the duration on it for PCs seems like nothing more
<BR>&gt; than an arbitrary compromise. I like the target Strength versus
<BR>&gt; spell idea, where each pulse or round or whatever increment of
<BR>&gt; time you want to use gives the victim a Strength check in order
<BR>&gt; to break free of the rooting.
<P>&gt; If there is going to be no loss of xp for other forms of PvP
<BR>&gt; death, obviously this should be fixed. Alternatively, I wouldn't
<BR>&gt; mind seeing xp loss occur for a PvP death just as it does for
<BR>&gt; death to an NPC. (Just don't like it when there's a double
<BR>&gt; standard.)
<P>&gt; Agree on faction hit for racial killing. And faction bonus for
<BR>&gt; racial killing. Both depending on the races involved. However,
<BR>&gt; like Demonspawn said, there's a fine line to walk here and a
<BR>&gt; pretty stringent system would have to be kept in check to keep
<BR>&gt; people from throwing themselves at someone of the same race they
<BR>&gt; don't like just to ruin the guy's faction.
<P>&gt; Yes, most definitely. I was always holding out hope that full
<BR>&gt; loot would be possible on Zek, but I can see that's never going
<BR>&gt; to happen because of the legion of Quakers inhabiting it. (Ever
<BR>&gt; notice how online worlds get a drastically disproportionate
<BR>&gt; percent of homicidal sociopaths?) At the very least, one item
<BR>&gt; should be lootable whether it's in a backpack or not.
<P>&gt; If you don't want to chance losing something nice, like Tempra
<BR>&gt; complained about, put it in the bank and take it out to shine it
<BR>&gt; up once a month so you can better gaze on it.
<BR>&gt; "Bagging" is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
<P>&gt; I think the limit should be broadened. Not sure about letting
<BR>&gt; lower levels attack highers at will. Although I agree in
<BR>&gt; principle, there's a logistic fiasco waiting to happen. Once the
<BR>&gt; lower level attacks the higher level, how long does the period
<BR>&gt; last during which the higher level gets to return fire? If you
<BR>&gt; use dueling rules, does the ability end as soon as one of the
<BR>&gt; two zones? Do you wait until one of them dies? If it's too
<BR>&gt; short, the higher level will moan bitterly and vice versa if
<BR>&gt; it's too long.
<P>&gt; If you have to have level limits on PvP (and I think everyone
<BR>&gt; knows that on EQ we have to, at least for the time being), then
<BR>&gt; keeping a hard limit like what exists now is necessary. I do
<BR>&gt; think that the level ranges should broaden at higher levels,
<BR>&gt; something along the lines of what Tempra suggested, but with the
<BR>&gt; range at 40-50 being 10 levels. The problem is in the backward
<BR>&gt; overlaps. For instance, if the range opens from 4 to 6 levels
<BR>&gt; difference at 20th, the 20th level character would be able to
<BR>&gt; attack 14th and 15th level characters but they couldn't initiate
<BR>&gt; combat on the 20th. And if it opens to a 10 range at 40th, the
<BR>&gt; 40th level characters could smack around people all the way back
<BR>&gt; to 30th.
<P>&gt; There are problems on both ends of this and, frankly, I'm not
<BR>&gt; sure what the best approach would be to make a system like this
<BR>&gt; work.
