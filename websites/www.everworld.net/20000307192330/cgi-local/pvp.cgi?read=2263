<P>Everquest is an online hack'n'slash/rpg where verant and 989 provide the game and gaming experience for a minor fee. That's right boys and girls this is a business. It's that simple. Now there is ONE pvp server and at least 14 carebear servers so where do you think verant/989 are going to focus their attention? ONE pvp server of 2000 people payin 9.95 or 12+ carebear servers with people paying 9.95. They go where the money is plain and simple.

<P>Now I honestly believe that they want to fix the problems with pvp combat, but all time, resources, and energy devoted to fixing the pvp server issues affect this server alone. It may also affect a handful of other players on the carebear servers but not enough to warrant intrest. If they devote the exact same set of people, time and resources to fix a carebear server problem it effects all of them. So its a numbers game, and we are the minority. Sure there may be another quasi pvp server or "race war" server in development but in the time since i first heard it's announcement 3 carebears server's have popped into exsistance. Face it folks we are the minority and therefore a lesser priority.
<P>As much as we love to play everquest the game, to verant/989 it's everquest the business. Businesses exsist to make money bottom line.
<P>p.s: On last tidbit. Thunor you comment about what this verant employee does with his time seems a little off to me. Who was to say he posted on company time? Everyone at some point takes work home and on the same hand goofs off at work. But i feel more verant employees should do like this person did. Verant/989 does not keep us as informed as most would like and never will if they get blasted on the boards for "wasting time" when they do. I believe that keeping in touch with as many customers as you can is a helpful thing to any business. Then again the typical customer that actually takes the time to write a business is rarley someone complimenting a company. MOre often however people only seemed motivated to communication if the have something to complain about.
