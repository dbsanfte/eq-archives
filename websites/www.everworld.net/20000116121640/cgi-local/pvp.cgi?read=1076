<P>

<BR>The idea of taking an experience point hit when you kill outside your factions has some merit. Eventually I think being unable to use your own home town will prove a detriment, but this is an additional penalty that makes some sense.
<P>It *could*, and I stress could, be a replacement for the moratorium on killing below the 4 level range limit. If a player for example were to kill someone more than 4 levels below, they could suffer a big XP hit, at least 1 bubble (20%) if not more. In this way you could still deal with truly annoying players, but it would cost you a great deal to do so. For the vast majority of players the threat of losing a bubble of XP would be enough deterrent to keep them from killing weak players. Those that repeatedly violated this would soon find their characters reduced to newbie levels. Still it smacks of the UO system of blue pking where you can go wax some monsters for a couple hours, then go out and kill a weak player, then go wax some monsters... If the penalty is stiff enough it could work. You would need some sort of toggle or warning so that a player did not accidentally attack a weaker, possibly the weak player hilights in yellow to warn a would be attacker that they are going to take a hit to XP if they kill that individual.
<P>I am going to ignore the rest of the posters suggestions that we implement a UO notoriety and PKing/murder flagging system in Everquest. They have no place here and are not needed.
<P>&gt; I will now respond to all the backlash I have been receiving:
<P>&gt; I'm told:
<BR>&gt; a) levels mean everything, so restrictions on killing must be
<BR>&gt; imposed.
<BR>&gt; b)senseless player killing exists becauuse it will always exist
<BR>&gt; c) items are so hard to aquire that looting must be restricted
<BR>&gt; d) realism is not everquest, because a game like everquest is
<BR>&gt; compromise of fun vs realism
<BR>&gt; e) being harassed is not an issue if the /ignore command is used
<BR>&gt; properly
<BR>&gt; f) nothing should force players to group as certain playes
<BR>&gt; prefer solo play.
<BR>&gt; huh? Why play online then you loner?
<BR>&gt; g) the pvp server is not good for role playing, the two do not
<BR>&gt; mix
<BR>&gt; h) Lastly, any of my previous suggestions would ruin PVP
<P>&gt; Now that I have a few more years under my belt on the pvp
<BR>&gt; server, I have to make the following satement:
<BR>&gt; The PVP server is useless and will die unless different
<BR>&gt; restrictions and more realistic ones can be found. (Realistic on
<BR>&gt; a MEDIEVAL standpoint. Not present day.)
<BR>&gt; Pehaps I'm in the wrong here, but PVP and roleplaying is the
<BR>&gt; only reason I wanted the restrictions removed. I do no
<BR>&gt; understand *AT ALL* why a PVP server should exist if no one
<BR>&gt; roleplays, you gain no experience from killing others, you
<BR>&gt; cannot loot them and you are forbidden from even wounding
<BR>&gt; someone who is out of your level range. I want the PVP server to
<BR>&gt; aid me in roleplaying. That is it. And so far, I have seen a
<BR>&gt; great deal of it done in Norrath, with the PVP thrown in as
<BR>&gt; well.
<BR>&gt; Of course, this is only dealing with beta players, not ten year
<BR>&gt; olds who run around slaying everyone with their trusty new sword
<BR>&gt; and amassing every flaming sword in the realm. No... for all the
<BR>&gt; reasons you spoke of before, I ask that the following
<BR>&gt; restrictions be used instead of the ones now in use:
<P>&gt; 1) Experience be ZERO or LOST by killing another player. (amount
<BR>&gt; increases infinitly as you slay someone of lower level)
<P>&gt; 2) Experience be ZERO or LOST by looting. (amount depending on
<BR>&gt; the uniqueness/value of the item and numbers taken)
<BR>&gt; If possible, inheritance should be established. Unique items or
<BR>&gt; high value items should not be able to be sold/traded/given or
<BR>&gt; destroyed. (such as beginning weapons) And should the PK holding
<BR>&gt; that item die, the gods restore it to its original owner. In
<BR>&gt; this way, PKs may steal what they want, though they loose some
<BR>&gt; experience, cannot rid themselves of unique items they steal,
<BR>&gt; and if the target of their player killing finds some way to kill
<BR>&gt; them (or they die of some othe cause) - they will get their
<BR>&gt; unique/expensive items back. Warning windows should state that
<BR>&gt; only the original owner of the item may take it without being
<BR>&gt; bound by the Gods to it till death. If the PK's player is not in
<BR>&gt; use for more than one month, the same thing occurs.
<P>&gt; 3) Multiple levels of notoriety be used one for each race which
<BR>&gt; never goes away.
<P>&gt; ex: Should a human kill other races, there will be no change in
<BR>&gt; his notoriety back home.
<P>&gt; ex: Should a human kill another human, he will quickly
<BR>&gt; (depending on levels and numbers of kills per length of time) be
<BR>&gt; ostricized from his homeland forever. Killed on sight of guards,
<BR>&gt; etc. No trading, etc.
<BR>&gt; The rate should be controlled carefully depending on levels,
<BR>&gt; numbers per length of time, etc.
<P>&gt; 4) Players who are avid player killers should be flagged a
<BR>&gt; special color. When you do a /who, their name should come up
<BR>&gt; Wanted if he is dangerous to your race, and then a different
<BR>&gt; color if his average kills per length of time is high.
<BR>&gt; NOTE: Experience losses by any of the above may reduce you in
<BR>&gt; level.
<P>&gt; In this way, I am free to kill who I like for whatever reason,
<BR>&gt; but there are strict consequences:
<BR>&gt; 1) Medieval realism is maintained at the slight cost of
<BR>&gt; experience. You can kill whomever you like for your own reasons.
<P>&gt; 2) Medieval realism is maintained at the slight cost of
<BR>&gt; experience. You can steal anything you like for any reason,
<BR>&gt; though if the item is unique or expensive you will be forced to
<BR>&gt; decided if you want to be stuck with it. And should you die, the
<BR>&gt; grace of the Gods restores it to the original owner. Players may
<BR>&gt; actually ask temples the names of their murderes and issue
<BR>&gt; contracts on their heads.
<P>&gt; 3) History of your deeds is recorded. Races you kill will
<BR>&gt; remember and not deal with you. Eventually you will not have a
<BR>&gt; bank, blacksmith, general store, magic shop to buy from.
<P>&gt; 4) You are visibly dangerous. Using the /who command other
<BR>&gt; players will be warned of your presence in the area and be
<BR>&gt; forewarned of danger.
<P>&gt; Please comment on my suggestions, for if we do not think of
<BR>&gt; something interesting soon, the
<BR>&gt; roleplayers-who-don't-want-restrictions and
<BR>&gt; the-players-who-don't-want-to-be-killed-senselessly will leave
<BR>&gt; the psycho-Quakers to the PVP server, ultimately ruining its
<BR>&gt; profit sense and spelling its demise.
