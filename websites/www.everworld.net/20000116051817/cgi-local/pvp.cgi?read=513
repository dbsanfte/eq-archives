</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> It's been said and I'd agree that by the time the game goes

<BR>&gt; commercial it's unlikely there will be any radical overhauls of
<BR>&gt; the PvP system. I'd like to get some input as to where people
<BR>&gt; are standing on a few things long term.
<P>I'll give it a go.
<P>&gt; 1. Do you feel that the separate +PvP/-PvP servers are something
<BR>&gt; that should be maintained or should Verant be putting efforts
<BR>&gt; into overcoming this division?
<P>Though I see some potential issues with the switch, I'm 90% for it. I think the +PVP server idea should at least be tried, and I hate to give the politician's answer, but I think we should reserve judgment until we see what it's like.
<P>I definitely think Verant should be paying attention to the PVP issue. After seeing the level of posting on this board, I think they realize there are a lot of people who want to see PVP work out. More and more people are speaking up now. Many people were afraid to talk about PVP because they didn't want to be tainted by the horrible image of UO, and the frenzy to crucify DOODZ was almost McCarthy-esque. People are starting to speak up with intelligent, well thought out points about the shortcomings of PVP. Minimizing this rift is to their advantage, and I think they see that, based on some of the things I've heard and their interest in seeing the PVP environment in action before final release.
<P>&gt; 2. Do you feel a "wide open" PvP environment will make
<BR>&gt; guild wars and racial friction less meaningful without a more
<BR>&gt; elaborate AI to encourage (or enforce) selective PvP?
<P>In the case of guild wars, people who are absolutely terrified of PVP and never even consider changing their switch are less likely to guild war, even though they don't have to go +PVP to do it. It's a whole different skill set. I don't care how many dragons you've slain, if you've never gone head to head with a real person on the other end of that graphic image, in my opinion, you're going to get killed by someone who knows how to PVP. So basically, what I'm saying is, the "-PVP no matter what" crowd will most likely never use the guild war feature.
<P>Regarding the racial friction issue: I think this is divided into two basic camps, those who will try and roleplay it, but can't because they're not +PVP, and those who see it as nothing more than a game obstacle to overcome. i.e. How do I go see my friend in his hometown when I know the guards will kill me? Where do I have to go to get a good price for this stuff? etc. Verant can implement racial friction and people will have to deal with it one way or another, but they will never be able to change the mindset for some that it's just another obstacle to overcome. They can't make people roleplay who don't want to. I've seen some intelligent posts regarding the irony of a system that forces you to group, then implements racial friction, an obvious stumbling block to forming up parties, meeting up with your friends and even playing the race that you want to play. I personally know people who decided not to play the race they wanted to merely because of the racial friction issues.
<P>&gt; 3. What's the most significant issue to you at this point?
<P>The most significant issue at this point is that we make the +PVP server work. That we police our own ranks and show Verant that we're not just a bunch of bloodthirsty boobs who want to slaughter each other at will. Show them that the PVP environment is made up of sophisticated gamers who enjoy the challenge of combat against the most dangerous adversary in any game, another human.
<P>&gt; 4. Lastly... how do you think some of these changes could be
<BR>&gt; implemented into the game at a later point without necessarily
<BR>&gt; throwing everything into chaos? (ie: i hear they're planning to
<BR>&gt; add the two missing continents sometime in the future... mayhaps
<BR>&gt; the laws of the land differ on the other side of the ocean)
<P>Well, it all depends on which changes you're talking about. I'm not a programmer or game developer of any sort, and I have no idea what goes into "code" or anything of that sort. I'm not qualified to say.
<P>But, regarding the other continents, the -PVP people will be just as excited to see the new territory as everyone else and keeping them from it would be a mistake in my mind, and if I were Verant, I wouldn't even consider it. Because no matter how civilized the PVPers may become here in Norrath, if the -PVP people never lose their fear of our environment, they'll never go there.
