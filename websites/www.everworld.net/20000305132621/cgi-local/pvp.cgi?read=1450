<P>To start off I want to say I haven't played UO, but I have heard many complaints about it. Number one is lag, number two is PVP.

<BR>From what I heard of it made me never want to pk ever.
<BR>Well, I have been playing Everquest since December, great game, I never played PVP because of the horror stories I heard about in UO.
<BR>My favourite character is a paladin, human or half elf, now paladins are good characters so I figured that my character should not like evil races/classes. That fell through. I grouped with shadow knights, ogres, and necromancers. Anyway, I saw a necromancer, and I fell into character and heckeled him because of his class (we were the same level) he challenged me to a duel, and I thought what the heck, I'm close to my respawn place anyway. So I dueled him. I was playing EQ for two months already, but not one NPC mob compared to how I felt when i was fighting that necro. It was a rush, my heart was beating, and I was cheering for my character to smoke him. I won, not by much though, (love that lay hands). Again anyway since then I hung out with the necro. I didn't become pvp, and i didn't duel again, and a month later in February the pvp server came about in phase 4. I jumped on the that server hoping I would once again get that buzz of figthing someone. Well at lvl 2 some wizzard attacked me for no reason, I fought back. At first I hated the guy, why would he attack me?? But the fight when on for a few minutes, because the wizz keep running in circles, to make this short I lost. :(
<BR>But i had fun!! After the fighted, I talked with him, said I was sorry for shouting obcentities at him when he first attacked me. He said it was cool.
<BR>To make this short, I plan to play on the PVP server. though a few things i don't like about it right now.
<P>!) There are no factions. Now you might say, oh no, not another-role playing-know-it-all-moron, in fact i don't always role play. I play a paladin and if i want to group with a troll shadow knight, i can, and i did. Though, the faction i do want is killing enemy race/class factions. why?? because of this scenerio. I get to high lvl with my paly, i go to dark elf town, or necro guild in Erudin, and kill some of the evil PC's (yes PC's), i want to go back to my guild, and be declared as a hero, get lower prices, have my guild leader give me a gift. I would also like it if some PC troll/ogre/necro/shadow knight..etc... ran into my guild or city and started slaying my NPC's, and PC's, i would defend my city, my guild, my friends.
<P>thats it, and if you didn't like my thoughts, appreciate my witty sense of humour, you mother is a cow
