<P>>Ok I was just shiftin through old messages on this board and I saw a >response to one of my posts about my alignment system that I had >missed. Here is the original message and then my response:

<P>&gt;Attempting to introduce an alignment system in place of the faction >system is not going to fly with Verant. They are wrapping this game >up for final delivery, so even if they liked the idea there's really >little or no hope of it going into EQ. EQ is built around the >faction system and the concept of the PvP switch. Replacing that >with alignment is somewhat more flexible in that it allows >individuals to choose their path as opposed ot having it ascribed to >them by their race, but it does not lend any sense of community >which the race/faction sytem does well.
<P>&gt;Two things for everyone to keep in mind when proposing ideas:
<P>&gt;#1 The PvP switch isi law. It's here to stay.
<BR>&gt;#2 This game is being released soon. No major revisions of this game >are going to be done by Verant.
<P>&gt;I expect their next game will be more complex, and have room for an >idea such as an alignment system in addtion to factions.
<P>&gt;- TheBlack[BCK]
<P>I agree with this, however one point i made in the alignment doc is that it would be based upon the faction system. I used standard RPG models along with the faction model to create this. The major difference the player would see is their character assigned a 'word' defining their alignment, however these words would simply be representative of a faction number or range of numbers. For example, a Good player could have a faction rating of 500, the character would see 'good' on their screen, but the server would read 500. I understand that Verant wants to stick with a numerical system, however that does not change much of the alignment system, and in no way diminishes its importance.
