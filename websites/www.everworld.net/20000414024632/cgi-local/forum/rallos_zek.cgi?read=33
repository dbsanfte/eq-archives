<P>A mysterious troll named Agrek the Doomweaver showed up at the entrance of Oggok a few days ago I called for a gathering of all the Dark Brothers. He was an old troll...REALLY old..and once we had gathered around(more that 20 ogres, trolls and dark elves at the end), he began to tell the story of the dark brother's past. This is what he said:

<P>The world was not like today. Gods made troll and ogres strong. Gods give many gifts to us when the world they create. And then Gods give us land for strong we were but that not last long...
<P>Small vermin called Lightdwellers not like us. Lightdwellers go to their gods and for change they ask. Remember I do when I fought the Cursed War and strong the trolls and ogres were and won we did. Gods to world come and all from us take away. They take smart away and land to lightdwellers give. All to take away they wanted. Then it was I remember...then it was....*sigh*....when gods Innoruk and CazioThuk together came and save us few they did. To protect us they took us then. All we had lost but they left our strength. Gods closed this land so lightswellers find us not and we here grow old. And here nothing we are. And forced are we to eat trash and frogs.
<P>But no more that is now. The Rathe gods are not in world. The Rathe holds us in no more and the lightdwellers forgotten they have about Desert Ro....lived I have longer than anyone. My mission is to weave doom for the lightdwellers. Avenge we must. Avenge we must blood of your fathers. But old I am. But old i am not in spirit. And to doomweave I am here. Bah you must all that dwell in light. Bash you must all that to lightgod praise.
<P>He went on to add that the Dark races should not fight amoungst themselves and must ralley together. It was kinda neat to see all the ogres in the Zone at one place.
