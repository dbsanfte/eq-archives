<P>> We were both Level 21, and we started off at the same time. We

<BR>&gt; battled about 2-3 times. I did lose all of the duels
<P>Frankly, I find this whole line of reasoning to be ludicrous at best. Does it -really- matter which class is "best"? If you are so enamoured with this sort of thinking, keep in mind that all classes are "best" at something.
<P>A high level wizard is capable of dealing out over 1000 hitpoints of damage in a single spell (yes, one THOUSAND, that is not a typo). Of course, it will drain his mana completely so whatever he was burning better not have any friends. So you could argue that a high level wizard is all but unbeatable in a duel. Unless the target resists, saves, or has more than 1000 hitpoints. In which case the wiz has zippo mana, no armor to speak of and negligible combat skills. In short, dead meat.
<P>A mid-level fighter is capable of dealing out around 100 to 150 hitpoints of damage per round. Yes, this is a full order of magnitude less than the wiz, but we're talking about a <i>15th</i> level character here. How long would a 15th level wiz last against that? As long as the Root holds, and thats about it. Let him close to melee, and the pure fighter will slice and dice just about anything in a major hurry.
<P>Every class has it's "niche". If you like stabbing people in the back, choose a Rouge. You'll suck in duels, you'll be ptitiful in "fair" fights, and you have almost no working skills. But that one backstab for triple damage and you'll be making somebody wish they weren't born (or, if they're smarter, wish YOU weren't born.)
<P>Dueling is <b>NOT<\b> a good way to determine which class is "best". As if there is such a thing. Stop obsessing about who is stronger than who. Just play the damn game. My dick is always going to be bigger than yours anyway.
