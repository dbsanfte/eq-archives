<P>Don't worry about people not really doing much reading, I mean truly, can't you hear the crickets. These halls are barren, not but a few people still wander about. Most seek the common room, though some others linger about with the soldiers in the barracks. A few may partake in a quick drink at the tavern, but it appears the ale is not in great demand these days. Our guests are mostly unlearned, and vulgar peasants, and the few who are not, prefer more to come for a nights rest, then to spend it in the library reading of the life of a stranger.

<P>Thankfully though there are still those of us who's own lives don't take up all their time and can still learn of others. About your sorrowful tale, it is well written, to be sure. I can not say it is good, but then, I would be surprise if were intended to be good, it is an evil tale, and thus can only be read as such. Alas, it is a tale full of truths though. It can easily be said that your first paragraph moved me. I can remember my first nights, wandering the killing fields passing the dead of humans, half-elves, and the creatures of the night, all left to rot, by their slayers. To stand over the fallen only to look up into the face of some beast or another, with no hope of escape, and only the desire to run. To run until you die, be it by exhaustion or by the creature in toe. With none around to help and only terror as a guide. Yes, it is an evil story, but it is truly written well.
