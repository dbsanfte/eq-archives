<P>> Exactly. These games had nowhere the amount of graphics

<BR>&gt; necessary to truly tax a 3dfx card. Newer games with more
<BR>&gt; textures, smoother polygons, dithering, pixel textures, etc. In
<BR>&gt; other words, "GLDoomt" 3dfx is easy to emulate,
<BR>&gt; "Quake2" is not.
<P>Agree with you there.
<P>&gt; You're probably right, it could do them, if it didn't have to
<BR>&gt; also be running your operating system (especially if you run
<BR>&gt; Windows) and the EverQuest game itself. Trust me, I have an
<BR>&gt; excellent computer and any attempt to "emulate" 3dfx
<BR>&gt; causes it to crawl at ~5 FPS.
<P>Emulator again, I don't need all the functions, all the textures, I just need to RUN the game and play it at some ~20-30 fps... and it possible I played many 3d games that dont require one and they work fine...so should EQ.
<P>&gt; Again, you're not going to find it. 3dfx has become the standard
<BR>&gt; and every new game that comes out takes advantage of the cards
<BR>&gt; that are out there more and more. The old games didn't make use
<BR>&gt; of all the possibilities, which is probably why people thought
<BR>&gt; they could work around the need for a card.
<P>As for not finidng it I already found it, its just matter of getting it .. 3DFX sued the maker of it (one that really works), so its not public on web...
<P>&gt; If you'll read, I suggested the Banshee was the only good 2d/3d
<BR>&gt; card, I never said it was better than the Riva TNT. Voodoo2
<BR>&gt; 3dfx, on the other hand, gives Riva a run for it's money;
<BR>&gt; neither are 2d/3d cards. The Asus might be the best 2d/3d card
<BR>&gt; available, but as I said, having a 2d/3d card will never compare
<BR>&gt; to having a 2dcard and a pure 3dfx card.
<P>&gt; I have a STB Velocity 128 w/ only 4MB of ram as my 2d card, and
<BR>&gt; a Voodoo2 3dfx 12MB accelerator and I have yet to find a game
<BR>&gt; that doesn't run at 50+ FPS on max resolution over my net
<BR>&gt; connection no less. No research is necessary to tell you that
<BR>&gt; 2d/3d cards do not compare to the performance of a 3dfx card,
<BR>&gt; and no amount of spouting about the advertisements you have read
<BR>&gt; in magazines will convince me differently.
<P>Heh, if you notice TNT is fastest card you can have
<BR>it beats Monter Diamond II 3D w/12Meg...
<BR>check www.tomshardware.com if you don't believe me
<BR>it beats everything..especially the top tnt's like viper550 and asus3400 which when overclocked works like 33% (or was it 25%) faster!
<BR>TNT can achieve incredible resolution at great frame rates...voodoo can't do this, they barely can reach 1024x768...
<BR>Go check only thing that beats TNT (2d/3d) (doesn't make difference...TAKE 3d board and add 3 chips and now u got 2d board+3d board)/..only thing that beats it is 2 monters in SLI mode, which again ya right I'm gonna waste two slots and $400+ just to get 3d acceleration..
<P>Reasons why TNT isn't just overwhelming voodoo and its lesser clones (banshee) is becaue it doesn't have Xwindow support for linux, and it doesn't work as nicely on slower machines. (there are other more techinical reasons a well)..but for overall perfrormance, TNT is clear winner..
<P>can't wait for Riva-TNT-2.... its gonna wipe voodoo3 off the market right away.
