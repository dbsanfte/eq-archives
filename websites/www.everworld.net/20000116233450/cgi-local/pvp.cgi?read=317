<P>First let me state that I plan on having some +PvP and -PvP characters, because with them, I will want to explore different aspects of the game. I haven't played, and won't play EQ until it's released, so my opinions are based entirely on reports I have read to this point. (That's my way of saying, take them for what they're worth.)

<P>The biggest problem I have with the solutions presented in the editorial is, I guess, a question of perspective. As it stands now, -PvP players would be able to explore the entire land of Norrath in the manner they choose to play, with like minded individuals. The +PvP players are able to do the same. There are many opinions on how many people are going to play one way or the other, and how easy/hard it will be to find those 'like minded individuals'. Until everyone actually gets into the game and plays, I don't think we'll really ever know. Perhaps in addition to a 'Norrath Roleplay' group, which is apparently gathering a large number of members, there needs to be a 'Norrath PK' (maybe there is).
<P>If the changes mentioned in the editorial are made, the perspective of the game would completely change. +PvP would be able to explore most of the game world, with some periods of time where they were restricted from some of the towns. However, the -PvP players would be limited to the 'safe zones', areas with guards, or patrols, or sanctuaries. Once they left those zones, they are forced to play +PvP. Once you're forcing someone to play a game in the way you choose, as opposed to the way they choose, I have to draw the line.
<P>If you want to take a step back and look at it, from the very beginning, it was called EverQuest, not EverPK. The day someone makes an EverPK, I'll try it too, and if I like it better, I'll stay there. That was the decision Sony/989/etc. made, and that's what we get. If the decision they made turns out to be one that no-one likes, they'll lose millions, and someone else will take the message and make a EverPK.
<BR>This is much more of a 'the way this game was designed to be' than 'the easy way out.'
