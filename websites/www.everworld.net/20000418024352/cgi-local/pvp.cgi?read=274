</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>And I'd tend to agree with it, but I think several people who are already seeing what they mistake for light at the end of the tunnel in your plan would start wailing in fury once they realized what it really means. A solution that works.

<P>IMHO not everyone by any means but certainly an alarmingly large number of the players wanting to play on the PvP server do not want balance, do not want consequences, in fact would rather not be reminded that the game deals with role-playing. They want to jump in and battle it out with everyone in sight... ya win some ya lose some... but ya have fun doing it. And hey... that's fine if that's what you're after but I don't think that's generally the object of a persistent virtual world. Rules, balance, consequences are the things that make up a virtual world... you do "x" and "y" happens. It's not just a matter of pressing a reset button on your control pad or throwing some more quarters in to start a new game.
<P>Games in the recent past like UO or Diablo might have had an opportunity to condition behaviour like that out so that it wouldn't have advanced at some point in time. But they didn't... and now it's not a few people trying to exploit the system but an organized, intelligent (cunning rather?), and determined sub-culture. Check out some of the PK boards sometime if ya haven't seen em. Detailed mentoring from the experienced players on how to take advantage of every loophole in a game, recomendations for 3rd party cheat programs, etc. But even more damaging to a games community is that they provide a completely external self-nurturing sub-culture that validates that style of play even encourages and rewards it. It changes the motivation from one of excelling in the gaming world... to purely earning a reputation among your "peers". Next to that... any form of environmental enforcement pales for motivation.
<P>The only way to truly combat this with these type of measures would be extremely heavy handed... and in alot of ways I think that could turn out to be more limiting to the non-abusive characters than the simple things like the +/-4 level limitation. Is segregation and the switch the best solution... very probably not... maybe the beta test with the inclusion of a PvP server will shed some light on a workable solution that could be incorporated into the whole game.
<P>I had ridiculously high hopes for UO after the alpha and beta, liked the thoughts behind the notoriety system, and had a blast early on with it. I got tired of it all too soon... and going back since was truly dissappointed to see it had degenerated past what I remembered.
<P>Who knows... maybe even some of the dialogue here will stir up something?
