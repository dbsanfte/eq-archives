<P>OK I got the exp back from my last problem, made it home and RACKED UP THE EXP.. let me tell you I got a level and a half.. I was quite happy.

<BR>Server down time.. so I goto bed.. Next day I get back on. meet up with a cleric and Lava zone and start my day for exp ( I am striving for 16 I am soo close) As I am blasting away an imp I notice this annoying skellie attacking me.. And it is not long after that I meet my death.. OK fine PKed on a pk server no biggie.. what do you do.. GO GET THE PK.. so I get organized and not having an imp on me I start my attack.. (I did check my exp because I was scared the imp got me but I lost no exp there) MY very smart germon partner and I came up to the bad necro.. He feared the pet and I started in with the blasting ( I LOVE MY WIZARD ) as the pet was gone he tried to run to the zone where he got close to it and stopped to face me.. Well who is going to win here neco with out pet or wiz.. as you could have guessed I BLASTED HIM GOOD!!! he comes back and attacks my cleric friend again.. again he dies.. Then fait turns against me.. as I await his return again THE EVIL INTERNET SHUTS DOWN.. I come back dead as expected.. look at my exp and well lost a half a bar.. so I figure an elemental got to me. but no I talk to my partner and said the necor did.. WHAT?? THEY FIXED DOT!!! so I come running back for my stuff.. Silly me not memorizing any spellz gets attacked again.. So I start running to my partner though I missed him somewhere along the way.. now being very close to a zone I remember I CANT ZONE DOT WILL GET ME!! so I sat there and died... come back MORE EXP LOSS!!! WTF!!! THEY FIXED DOT!!!!! so I petition.. no gms are on and me being very mad go eat dinner.. come back hour and half later. MY PETITON IS STILL IN THE SYSTEM!!! NO!!! so I /tell the gm.. he gets to me and says oh I saw your petition. (This bone head did not remove it so I am force not to be able to get gm help the proper way all night) by the way this is the same bone head that said he could not do anything about the guard bug from last time.. Now they sitting there saying if you get dot casted on me dont zone.. I DID NOT ZONE ( TRYING TO BEAT IT IN THERE HEAD ) and again I can not recover my exp.. Which quit pissed me off!! Loosing a bar of exp to PVP is not right.. and he tried to do it a third time but this time I did zone (why not going to lose exp anyway ) and survived that encounter as I was just sitting on the hill waiting for gm.. The same time I talking to this bone head guide.. I /tell Uini which is a real GM and he said it is fix and not to go threw a zone! I DID NOT GO THREW A ZONE!!!! and I have to eat the bar of exp.. I tell the guide that he is the same one that miss helped two nights before and the guard was a bug.. he still said he could do nothing.. so I asked him what good is he there.. WHAT CAN YOU DO!! he told me to report him as harassing you.. (This works great on a system where you petition and it takes 2 - 3 hours for them to even get to you ) So I did that but by this time the guy is long gone and I have given up on any gm other then Trok.. Fact is if you put I a petition and wait for answer then when you really need a gm you cant petition because you cant have more then one...... and they DONT REMOVE THEM.. as I think they don’t on purpous!! UGGG SONY NEEDS TO GET THERE ACT TOGETHER SOON.... GMS NEED TO HELP IN GAME..
