<P>> I have been told by ,many people that it is a bard, but was

<BR>&gt; wondering what everone else thinks.
<P>Screw the bard. You want a powerful class? Necromancer. Up until level 11, they are pushovers. But they start gaining power exponentially once they hit level 12 and beyond. Why?
<P>1) Spellcaster class. If you MUST go out and PK everyone, then go with the spellcaster class. Spellcasters do not depend on equipment at all for their offensive abilities. A fully armored and armed Necro is more or less just as powerful as one that has nothing on. So leave all your stuff at the bank and forget about your corpse if you die.
<P>2) Pets. Pets are great. At level 12, they get double attack and magical attacks. They are pains in the asses. They are your tanks.
<P>3) Damage. At level 12, you start doing incredible amounts of damage. You have 2 damage over time spells and a lifetapping spell (Direct damage to target while healing you). On top of that, one of your damage over time spells slows the target, so they cannot run away (they must essentially walk away). You can do around 300 points of damage at this point.
<P>Of course, there are negatives. You are a spellcasting class, so you are more or less dead if a well healed warrior class comes right in your face with some melee. And you're a necro, so you will probably have a hard time going to a lot of shops. And then there are people who will say "No! So-and-so is the best class." Well, good for them. As for me, I'd choose a necro if I were to go on a PK rampage.
