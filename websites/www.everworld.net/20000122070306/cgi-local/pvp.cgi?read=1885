<P>Brad,

<P>Welcome back! Now to the unresolved matters. There are a few major burning issues that many of us hope you can address
<BR>to make our Everquest experience more enjoyable.
<P>#1 Faction hits for killing your own race.
<P>This is without a doubt at the top of the list of issues among players on the PvP shard. I can say we have reached a concensus
<BR>here that we want characters who kill members of their own race to take BIG faction hits. It would be nice, but not absolutely
<BR>necessary, if a player who burns his bridges in his own community gained some status in an opposed faction's community
<BR>(hated by Halflings but now tolerated by Trolls and Ogres). The EQ racial communities are otherwise working very well on the
<BR>PvP shard.
<P>#2 Fix the player looting to monster kill bug.
<P>If a player dies to a MOB their corpse should never be lootable. The code already exists to track who did the most damage to
<BR>a MOB to determine who gets to loot the MOB. That same approach needs to be applied to players. If a player dies and the
<BR>majority of the damage was player inflicted, then the body is lootable to the player who caused the most damage. If a group
<BR>inflicted the damage then anyone in the group can loot the victim. If a MOB did most of the damage then the body should be
<BR>unlootable. This issue really upsets a lot of players. It also causes game imbalance when low level characters loot fallen
<BR>players slain by monsters. The 1 item loot rule for PvP deaths is great, but the implementation of the rule is incomplete. Please
<BR>finish this important task!
<P>#3 Tone down or eliminate remotely located faction guards.
<P>The presence of racial/faction guards near home city zones is important, but faction/racial guards in outlying areas such as
<BR>Commons and Oasis is a debilitating factor on the PvP server. PvP players whose character race is opposed to the zone's
<BR>factions become debilitated in such zones. Please either greatly reduce the power of such NPCs, neuter their factions so they
<BR>are not aggro to players, or simply remove them entirely.
<P>#4 The /con feature needs adjustment for PvP players.
<P>Please temper or remove the /con feature when it is applied to other players. My suggestion is that /con show players neutral
<BR>(white) if they are within 2 levels of one an other. If 3 or 4 levels below have it show blue, and if 3 or 4 levels above use yellow.
<BR>More than 4 levels below can use green and more than 4 above use red. Some players would like to see it removed entirely
<BR>but I think my suggestion is the most fair, considering anyone 3 or more levels above another player is virtually assured to
<BR>defeat their opponent. Using a neutral tell for +/- 2 levels gives us a 5 level difference of opponents that will show up neutrally,
<BR>which seems like a fair compromise.
<P>#5 Spell interruption.
<P>This is a broad issue not limited to PvP. For whatever reason, a lot of times a spell will be "interrupted" even though the caster
<BR>is not moving and not under attack. A number of other players have complained and posted about this phenomenon. There
<BR>are few things as frustrating as chasing a fleeing mob, then stopping and casting a spell, only to wait for the spell to complete
<BR>and get the message "your casting is interrupted." As a short term workaround please make the interruption occur at the
<BR>outset of casting, not at the conclusion. This would be a 100% improvement over the current state of affairs.
<P>There are a number of other improvements that could be made but the aforementioned are the major issues that are annoying
<BR>and troubling the greatest number of players and come up most often as comlaints on the message boards.
<P>Thanks for your time,
<P>The Black
<P>Note:
<P>I attached a #6 Fix the backpack no-loot bug to address the inability to loot items hidden in backpacks. I also made the suggestion that very rare or unique items could be designated as non-lootable by Verant if they felt a need to do so.
