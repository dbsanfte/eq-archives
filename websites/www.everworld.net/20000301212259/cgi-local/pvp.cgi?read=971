<P>

<BR>Well from what I observed in earlier phases, SKs become rather unplayable in the late teens to early 20 levels. As far as being a PvP class I'm not certain how viable they are. Their damage attack is 10 points per level, which is nice, but the important issue is how much damage can they heal back?
<P>Ogre's are great at blocking corridors in dungeons, but are just as easily trapped therein by their huge size. Having really high strength is not that great of an advantage as it just means you do the max allowed damage for your weapon type more often, but no more than anyone else could do with that same weapon.
<P>I played an Ogre Shaman in P3 which I enjoyed and the class also did well in PvP. If I were to do it over, I would pay more attention to AGI and DEX and less to my STR and STA.
<P>&gt; There is little information (anywhere) regarding character
<BR>&gt; setup.
<P>&gt; The current classes that seem to be favorable on the PvP server
<BR>&gt; apparently are: Monks, Mages, and Rouges? Could someone be kind
<BR>&gt; enough to illustrate the reasons for these preferences?
<P>&gt; Summary of Ogre Shadow Knight:
<P>&gt; Advantages: Highest HP, Greatest Str, Greatest Stamina, Greater
<BR>&gt; Infravision.
<P>&gt; Disadvantages: Hated by nearly every race in Norrath save for
<BR>&gt; Dark Elfs and Trolls, Size ( proves to create
<BR>&gt; "interesting" situations in tight dungeon corridors ;p
<BR>&gt; ) Low Wis, Low Int ( but still higher than a trolls )
<P>&gt; *Most other races/class combo's info can be readily gleaned
<BR>&gt; through message boards and the like but anything concerning
<BR>&gt; Ogres and Trolls are hard to come by. Anything regarding these
<BR>&gt; elusive wretches would be highly appreciated.*
<P>&gt; Any thoughts or first hand accounts that could be added to the
<BR>&gt; above would be greatly appreciated.
<P>&gt; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<BR>&gt; - - -
<P>&gt; Just as in Ultima favored tatics in the art of killing are
<BR>&gt; starting to develop in Norrath.
<P>&gt; The ( slim ) below list briefly touches on skills/spells that
<BR>&gt; are being extensively used in our bloody art. Feel free to add
<BR>&gt; to this.
<P>&gt; Root ( Paralysis, which basically prevents prey from making a
<BR>&gt; break to the zone or guards
<P>&gt; BackStab ( Double the amount of damage when striking at the
<BR>&gt; back- Tried and true Rogue ability )
<P>&gt; Various offensive mage spells ( Once casted the poor sod at the
<BR>&gt; receiving end can't do much to "dodge" or run away
<BR>&gt; from the affects of direct damage spells )
<P>&gt; Are fighting styles strongly dependent on the class one is
<BR>&gt; using? If so, which fighting styles do you prefer above the
<BR>&gt; rest?
<P>&gt; Many Thanks
<P>&gt; DarkBlight
