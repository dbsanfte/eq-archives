<P>

<BR>I had thought that Verant had fixed the open looting bug, and at one point I had verified this was the case. Now from recent posts it sounds like they have once again removed the looting restrictions on red corpses? Is this true? From a standpoint of game balance if for no other reason, this should not be allowed.
<P>1 item loot limit and only for PvP kills. If a group makes a kill then anyone in the group can loot, otherwise the player that delivered the most damage gets to loot the corpse (just like with MOBs).
<P>&gt; ALL the experiences I have had with this looting thing have been
<BR>&gt; bad. I don't even think that you should have exp loss when
<BR>&gt; looting someone you did not kill I simply think that if you
<BR>&gt; don't kill em , you aint lootin em. The equipment based classes
<BR>&gt; suffer a LOT more then you pure magic users. Even with the exp
<BR>&gt; loss, lets say I am a low level whatever and I am out wandering
<BR>&gt; around the karanas and I see a level 18 get killed by a hg, well
<BR>&gt; I run over there and low and behold he has a peice of chain mail
<BR>&gt; on him. You better believe I'm taking the exp loss and it gonna
<BR>&gt; be nutin compared to the loss of his 36 plat and the super
<BR>&gt; advancement to mine.
<BR>&gt; With no +- level limit to pking, I agree there shouldn't and if
<BR>&gt; they don't fix the magic resist and what have you when fighting
<BR>&gt; a 1 or 2 level higher character that idea may be bad but it
<BR>&gt; seems like it is our only option. If they manage to water it
<BR>&gt; down enough I am okay with it. With the exp loss of killing a
<BR>&gt; below 4 level character I don't know about this. If you have a
<BR>&gt; bunch of cheezy killers out there who are killin everyone in the
<BR>&gt; zone, then the whole zone comes together and whoops em( seen it
<BR>&gt; happen). But then again I cannot foresee how bad it might get so
<BR>&gt; I say we play it safe and go with the blacks idere here.
<BR>&gt; On the killing of your own kind I have a different twist to
<BR>&gt; that. Upon killing your own kind(given that your within 4
<BR>&gt; levels) you become a betrayer to your race and other races are
<BR>&gt; simply neutral towards you. Upon killing 2 of your own kind
<BR>&gt; other races will like you. ( some are prob thinking it should be
<BR>&gt; more but we dont want a lot of same race killing , in fact it
<BR>&gt; might be better to leave it at 1 kill) You will be able to live
<BR>&gt; amongst the other races. Example I am a barbarian and kill a
<BR>&gt; barbarian now the dark elves, ogres, and trolls like me. Here is
<BR>&gt; the two catches #1 you cant just run over to neriak, whack a few
<BR>&gt; d elves and then run back to halas a smilin. In fact I don't
<BR>&gt; think you should be able to turn back as people will abuse the
<BR>&gt; system no matter what the number.( he betrays the barbs, because
<BR>&gt; he hates the barb he killed, runs over to neriak and kills his
<BR>&gt; newbie buddy 20 times until the barbs like him again). #2 once
<BR>&gt; you betray an option is brought up and you can choose where to
<BR>&gt; be 'bound' to, such as oggok, grobb, or neriak, or vice versa of
<BR>&gt; course.
<BR>&gt; In order for this to work once you betray ALL of the opposing
<BR>&gt; side has to like you. This may or may not be implementable but
<BR>&gt; would be extremely fun and even up the race wars for sure which
<BR>&gt; is why I suggested it in the first place.
<BR>&gt; My next point is on travcel amongst the dark races. It is damn
<BR>&gt; near impossible for a d elf to run thru all the zones includin
<BR>&gt; oasis mind you to get to grobb and then party with them there.
<BR>&gt; All the other races get to team up with there allies very
<BR>&gt; easily. Dwarves and elves, humans and barbs or erudites the list
<BR>&gt; goes on. My suggestion here has already been posted and CAN
<BR>&gt; easily be implemented and would be very cool at the same time.
<BR>&gt; Have an underground boat from neriak to grobb and back! Wouldn't
<BR>&gt; that solve that prob and be sweet at the same time? And the
<BR>&gt; zones like south desert of ro and such would still be used as
<BR>&gt; the have orcs and good creatures to fight at certain levels.
<BR>&gt; The problem I see is that the dark races even with the boat are
<BR>&gt; limited to this continent. We can never get to erudia because
<BR>&gt; the boat is in the middle of qeynos! Yes we can with invis but
<BR>&gt; thats self only in most cases and organizing that would well be
<BR>&gt; near impossible so I suggest land bridges or an evil boat to
<BR>&gt; both continents and to the other 2 continents if they are going
<BR>&gt; to be in game.
<BR>&gt; With the dark races mingling and traitors joining and leaving
<BR>&gt; the pvp server would simply be the funnest thing on gods green
<BR>&gt; earth:)
