<P>

<BR>This is the #1 reason why PvP will or won't work in Everquest. I've been beating this drum for months, and if something is not done soon we can essentially write it off as an option.
<P>The Everquest algorithms for determining ATK, DAM, and spell resistance are based on the PvE design, and incorporate code to prevent rapid levelling and twinking. If you could spell damage MOBs that are 2 or more levels above you just as well as those your own level, then groups of mages could go around at low levels and find ways to exploit and take out powerful creatures for BIG XP gains. I understand what 989 is doing and agree with it for PvE, but is has to GO for PvP!
<P>Spell resistance, attack, and damage calculations must be modified for PvP specific combat. All three should work much better across a broader range of player levels. If a level 10 and a level 20 for some reason both have the same ATK and DAM numbers, and given their AC is the same then they should have the same chances to hit each other and same range of damage available given they are using the same weapon. Resist should be level based but not impossible to effect players 1-2 levels above yourself as is currently.
<P>Weapons should be largely de-nurfed in PvP as well. For example a weapon with a 13 damage factor is limited to 1-18 until level 10 is reached, at which time it goes to 1-24. At some point I believe it hits 1-32, or at least it did in earlier versions of EQ. The 1-18 weapon probably does even less at low levels but I haven't tried it.
<P>Once the above issues are addressed there are some improvements that can be made to make PvP better, but I look upon the aforementioned as an absolute necessity to making PvP viable before other measures are taken.
<P>&gt; The resist formula or whatever that is used for people needs to
<BR>&gt; be calibrated so that someone a bit lower has a chance to kill
<BR>&gt; someone higher. i fought a friend of mine who was lvl 21 when i
<BR>&gt; was 22 and he started casting spells and not ONE one his spells
<BR>&gt; hurt me and 80% of mine went through. I wouldnt even dare try
<BR>&gt; someone who is 2 lvls higher then you unless it was a melee
<BR>&gt; fight. As it stands melee will be the better tool to use when
<BR>&gt; fighting higher lvls and magic will be better when fighting
<BR>&gt; lower lvls. The resist for monsters seems to be fair, even when
<BR>&gt; a monster is a few lvls above me and is red my spells still hurt
<BR>&gt; him like 40% of the time. WHy is this not the case for PvP? if
<BR>&gt; they took the resist that is used for PvE and put it in PvP it
<BR>&gt; would be much better. As it stands any spell casting class
<BR>&gt; fighting a lvl or two higher will not even have a chance. i did
<BR>&gt; this testing right before the 3.0 and 3.5 break.. i played on
<BR>&gt; 3.0 so if anything has been tweaked on 3.5 please forgive me....
