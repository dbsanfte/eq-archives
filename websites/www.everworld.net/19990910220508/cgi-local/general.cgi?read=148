<P>I propose this goal: Keep all the players busy and on edge.

<P>I recommend: make the number of monsters which spawn proportional to the number of players camping the spawn point?
<P>As I see it players can be in 3 states
<BR>A. fighting
<BR>B. healing
<BR>C. waiting
<P>To accomplish the goal, simply keep players out of C. (waiting).
<P>There are several options available
<BR>1. increase the number of spawn points for each monster level range
<BR>2. increase filler spawn frequency proportional to # players camping
<BR>3. increase damage done per monster spawned (their level)
<P>By "filler spawn" I mean orc legionaires not Emporer Crush. Give Emporer Crush 5 more royal guards with money only loot when the palace is camped by 10 people and 8 more guards when camped by 15 people.
<P>There are then several balancing effects to equalize again:
<BR>A. The rate at which unique items are created
<BR>B. The number of players at any one spawn point
<BR>C. The experience a player can earn by playing for an hour
<P>Reasoning: players look for the best hunting ground available for their level - the calculation is based on loot gained + exp gained / time spent. Players will spend longer camping for ghoulbane then for 2sp.
<P>Bigger reason: As the number of level 20+ Paladins increases faster than the number of ghoulbanes in the game, more people will camp the Ghoulbane spawn point. For these players know that they will not be able to buy one unless someone else has spent the extra hours to get a few extra ghoulbane swords so as to have extras.
<P>I posit that players naturally will not want to fight in an area which will give them exp only. They may wish to fight in an area which gives them good money so they can try to buy the sword. But they would prefer to be able to be near where ghoulbane spawns and have the chance at the spawn and if they don't get it they still get exp rather than just sitting there waiting.
<P>Exploring option 1:
<BR>+B more places to hunt and get experience at your level
<BR>-A making unique items less rare dilutes the game
<BR>-A creating new unique items takes development effort
<BR>+C more monsters for everyone
<BR>- no gain if this area is not used (bad (loot+exp)/time ratio)
<BR>Requires: work. must increase the selection of unique items
<BR>Example: would you fight asps dropping 2sp or dervs dropping mithril earrings worth 3pp if each took the same amount of effort to kill?
<P>Exploring option 2:
<BR>same as 1 for the most part
<BR>Biggest +: players aren't in a place which NEVER spawns a unique monster, rather they are in a place which still spawns a rare monster every 30/90 minutes and are still getting exp
<P>Exploring option 3:
<BR>+ players spend more time healing
<BR>+ players get more experience from fewer kills
<BR>+ less people soloing, forces groups to form
<BR>- increases level of players at camp
<BR>- decreases number of spawn points for lower level spawns
<BR>Reasoning: effectively this increases the level of all the monsters in the game making it harder for novices to level up.
<P>Reasons: Frankly its boring going kamikaze against everything that pops up when you know that it will be dead in 4 rounds and you have no fear
