<P>

<P>I hope this continue's, First I'll just say I enjoyed your post and I hope it is well recieved by the powers that be. BTW I play a Dwarf Warrior on E-marr. I've also been playing paper and video game rpg's for about 15 years. I've cut the sections out that I have comments on.
<P>There aren't very many clasic Dungons in this
<BR>game (towers, constructed underground dungons, whatever) that
<BR>include locked doors and traps. I hope to see some of these for
<BR>you guys.
<P>I've seen a few locked doors that thieves can practice on, but I was told by a friend of mine that he had to put more then 20 points into this skill to start going up. When he did it took a very long time for it to succeed and I had to watch his back because we were in befallen. As far as I know the only traps in the game are illusions that drop you into holes or into monster pits. I think it would be great if mechanical traps were introduced to the game. Only with the stipulation that without disarm traps any attempt to handle the trap automatically trips it. And even if an attempt to disarm with the skill fails it doesn't always trip the trap.
<P>The other point I see complaints about is the backstab ability. I can see a few possible answers for this. The first is to make backstab an automatic skill, and that any piercing attack at a monsters back would be a backstab for some good damage. This would be countered by the fact that you would definatly tick off the monsters and have them pummuling your low HP totals. The other answer is to have backstabs do way much more damage. This would make the backstab worth the risk of sneeking up behind the monster to pull it off. It's a backstab, the dagger in the back that has killed kings and felled giants, right?
<P>I agree that this should be an automatic skill. I think that if a thief can successfully hide and or sneak up to a monster then they should be able to do a critical success amount of damage on that one hit. I also think that if a thief can get behind monsters while fighting in a group that they should also be able to get a backstab off. Or at least the chance for one. I think the possibility for the stab should be automatic like dodge or parry when the thief is in the right place "ie behind the monster". My other complaint in the backstab ability is this. From what everyone I've heard talk on the subject it does nice but not outstanding damage. And when successful it truly angers the mobs. I agree to this. But npc thiefs, like the bandits of ButcherBlock can backstab for over 100 hp per hit. Now I realise this sound petty, but I tried to fight PegLegs crew in BB 2 of my partners died and I tried to run. Now the fact I was hit I fully except. But PegLeg backstabbed me for over 100 points of damage, and what kills me is he didn't have a weapon in his hands.
<P>Warrors, I feel sorry for you as well. You get the shaft. There
<BR>is no skill that is unique to your class. At mid levels you
<BR>spend way to much time healing. And without good armor or
<BR>weapons you are nothing. Well here's what I have in mind: The
<BR>first thing is you need unique skills. The best idea I have seen
<BR>is what one poster described as "know thy enemy" where
<BR>as a warrior fights a class of monster again and again he would
<BR>do more damage and take less from them. The warrior would then
<BR>be able to take on several orc cents with relative ease, but the
<BR>bigger and rarer monsters would still be tough, and require him
<BR>to party.
<P>I think this is a good idea, though I'd call it tactics. I'd even suggest it could be different skills for different monsters.
<P>Also there needs to be a seperation of bash/kick/slam.
<P>I agree in this too, but in interest of balance I'd suggest that the slam, bash, kick cycle rate be connected in there own wheel. Were at lower lvl's they will knock each out, but as your lvl increases the delay is shorter till you only have to wait for the individual skill's to refresh.
<P>A good counterpoint I've seen is to increase a warriors defensive ability. To not only give him high HP totals but to take less damage from a monster than an equally equiped hybrid class.
<P>I like this idea too, though I'd sugest it be another skill, armor maxing or something like that. Something that goes up as the warrior's lvl does. Though similar to the monk's ac adj I'd say it's different because it should require armor in the different area's to get the added bonus. Kinda like increasing the ac difference for warriors for having the different armor pieces. I'd also add that I think straight warriors should have higher caps on there weapon skills maybe lvl x 5 +10 or 15 just enough so there is a real difference between warriors and the hybrids.
<P>Shadow Knights need slight revamping, no pun intended. I know a
<BR>lot of you are screaming for healing spells but I don't think
<BR>you should get them. SKs have the premise of being an attacking
<BR>spell fighter, while Paladins and Rangers fill the healing and
<BR>utility figher roles respectively. But what you guys do need is
<BR>better attacking spells. And you need to loose the pet, what
<BR>good is it anyways? Raise your hands if you'd trade your pet
<BR>spell for a good direct damage spell.
<P>I think it'd be fair for them to get the better lifetaps since it does dd and heals them, but I don't think they should be able to heal others.
<P>Harm Touch once per day limits it too much. I played a SK and
<BR>found out I rarely used it as I kept waiting for that monster
<BR>I'd really need it for. And once I had I might of well loged out
<BR>and played another char for an hour. I'd like to see it changed
<BR>to once every 8 game hours. I belive that would make it better
<BR>balanced.
<P>I think that's a decent idea or perhaps give them the ability to store the charge. This however would mean that they could save up and devestate something with multiple harm touches unless some per monster limit could be established.
<P>The first and biggest change I want to see is what I've been
<BR>telling the paladins to grit thier teeth about. Treat hit
<BR>interuptions as fizzles. I also think a great equalizing idea would be that if a monster successfully bash's a spellslinger that they have a chance to forget a spell. Not lose it from there book just make them rememorize it. This would encourage mage's with pet's to keep them guarding, which gives the warriors there jobs back. Also it would cause wizards to need to group instead of a group needing the wizard.
<P>Another problem is the ability for a spellcaster to bind themselves anywhere. I say restrict them to the cities like anybody else. I've yet to see a reason why they really need to be bound at the entrance to some dungon or in the middle of the wilderness. It stinks of a bind point attack.
<P>I agree on this one too. As is when a caster dies in a dungeon then there out of action long enough to relearn there spells and then fetch there body. Everyone has to fetch there bodies but warriors are defenceless till they do. Mage types once they get there spells should be able to deal with things, because honestly they don't tank so the lack of gear shouldn't hinder them in recovering their bodies.
<BR>Either that or they should loose there spellbooks with their bodies.
<P>I've seen several
<BR>ideas on how to fix this, but I think the best of the lot is
<BR>this: have spellcasters come back with no mana. It's not a whole
<BR>lot, and by itself may not solve the "naked mage
<BR>syndrome" but the 4-5 minutes it takes them to recharge to
<BR>full mana will give fighters a chance, and let mages feel naked
<BR>after a death like the fighers do.
<P>I like this idea too.
<P>MONSTERS:
<P>Are all monsters master monks or somthing? Now I know they are
<BR>naturally skilled with using thier fists, but having a kolbold
<BR>do more damage with fists than my 5th level TSK could with a
<BR>good sword is stupendous!
<P>I strongly agree with this complaint. Things should be realistic. Especially with the humanoid mobs. As I commented earlier, I've experienced a dwarf npc hit me for over 100 points of damage with a punch. Now that was a back"stab" attack but this same npc hit for mid 20's going toe-to-toe. I could understand it if players could do that kind of damage, but I'd like some form of game balance. It would be simple enough to provide the npc's with rusty weapons. Just to provide some form of a reality check. I don't even thing the extra weapons would disrupt the economy of the game much even. The surplus would drop the prices and life would move on.
<P>Dragons and Hill Giants I can understand, but the halfling necro NPC that hits for 40 with bare hands and who slams?!? Not to mention I watched 4 fighters take her on and never interuped one of her spells!
<P>I think the bash should be as it is with monsters. If you successfully bash you stun your opponent and if it's a spellslinger then the spell automatically gets disrupts the spell. I think it should be like monsters though, the stun might only last 1/2 a second but it should also be able to last 30 seconds or so. But I also think it'd be fair for at least some mage types to get a stun or petrify spell that works like a basilisks stun.
<P>Another bad thing I've found is now that I'm level 10, every monster I fight can bash. This makes it pratically imposible for me to run from a train of 3 or more. My only chance is to target, snare, run,
<BR>target the next, snare, run. I feel sory for any class without a
<BR>snare or root spell at my level.
<P>I think that monks and warriors should have a higher chance to resist stuns, and mage types that have buffs should have a buff that prevents or at least ups the resistance to stun's.
<P>And I dare to imagine a 10th level warrior fighting two of these being stuned by one and then the other. And why is it so tough to hit them when they aren't even wearing any armor? Are thier skins really that much tougher than the steel in my axe?
<P>This agian I feel adding realism to the game wouldn't be disruptive. Just show some npc's with armor and some without. Those who aren't shown with armor shouldn't be that hard to kill. Those with, there should be a possibilty to salvage some of the armor. Agian I don't feel the economy would be that interupted because it would balance out.
<P>Since when did only players take damage from falling? It's because of this that surefall only makes since in PvP combat. Against monsters it only ensures that you don't die from the fall. They won't hesistate from following you.
<P>This is another chance for realism, what's good for the goose is definately good for the gander. Either cause them to take damage and allow that to be a valid hunting technic or cause them to stop at the edge. Either way would be more in tune with true game balance and realism.
<P>And since when did monsters have the perfect direction sence?
<BR>I've had ice boned skels chase me over hills, around mountians,
<BR>and never loose track of me. And I thought I was a good ranger.
<P>I agree here too, though I see the reason for this. If you could loose the monsters then they would have to remain hating you till that spawn dies. Since leaving the zone is essentially loosing them in a sense. This would be difficult with memory of mobs and with the fact that the balance of the game would still be tilted.
<P>Bows on the other hand need a complete overhall. The attack
<BR>rates are way too slow and the damage dosn't match what it
<BR>should. Bows were suposed to be rangers and rogues trademark
<BR>weapons, but as they stand they only have two good uses. The
<BR>first is to tick off monsters and get them to attack you. The
<BR>other, the only reason I keep using a bow, is a player can pop
<BR>one or two shots into a fleeing monster and get them back into
<BR>melee range. I also belive the minium range idea for a bow
<BR>stinks. I'd much perfer to see bows getting interupted rather
<BR>than see the "I'm too close even though his back is turned
<BR>to me" message. The last complaint, as with throwing
<BR>weapons, is please allow me to pull some of what I've unloaded
<BR>into a monster off of his corpse.
<P>I think I agree with every point here. Though I think arrows once fired are pretty much lost. Since when a wooden arrow hit's something it's almost guarenteed that it'll shatter. On the otherhand shuriken's, daggers, spears and axes should be recoverable. Of course they might not be found and someone else might pick them up, but that would be part of the game.

&gt; Were at lower lvl's they will knock each out, but as your lvl 
&gt; increases the delay is shorter till you only have to wait for 
&gt; the individual skill's to refresh. 

&gt; A good counterpoint I've seen is to increase a warriors

&gt; enough so there is a real difference between warriors and the 
&gt; hybrids. 

&gt; Shadow Knights need slight revamping, no pun intended. I know a 
&gt; lot of you are screaming for healing spells but I don't think

&gt; I like this idea too. 

&gt; MONSTERS: 

&gt; Are all monsters master monks or somthing? Now I know they are

&gt; Dragons and Hill Giants I can understand, but the halfling necro 
&gt; NPC that hits for 40 with bare hands and who slams?!? Not to 
&gt; mention I watched 4 fighters take her on and never interuped one 
&gt; of her spells! 

&gt; I think the bash should be as it is with monsters. If you 
&gt; successfully bash you stun your opponent and if it's a 
&gt; spellslinger then the spell automatically gets disrupts the 
&gt; spell. I think it should be like monsters though, the stun might 
&gt; only last 1/2 a second but it should also be able to last 30 
&gt; seconds or so. But I also think it'd be fair for at least some 
&gt; mage types to get a stun or petrify spell that works like a 
&gt; basilisks stun. 

&gt; Another bad thing I've found is now that I'm level 10, every 
&gt; monster I fight can bash. This makes it pratically imposible for 
&gt; me to run from a train of 3 or more. My only chance is to 
&gt; target, snare, run, 
&gt; target the next, snare, run. I feel sory for any class without a 
&gt; snare or root spell at my level. 

&gt; I think that monks and warriors should have a higher chance to 
&gt; resist stuns, and mage types that have buffs should have a buff 
&gt; that prevents or at least ups the resistance to stun's. 

&gt; And I dare to imagine a 10th level warrior fighting two of these 
&gt; being stuned by one and then the other. And why is it so tough 
&gt; to hit them when they aren't even wearing any armor? Are thier 
&gt; skins really that much tougher than the steel in my axe? 

&gt; This agian I feel adding realism to the game wouldn't be 
&gt; disruptive. Just show some npc's with armor and some without. 
&gt; Those who aren't shown with armor shouldn't be that hard to 
&gt; kill. Those with, there should be a possibilty to salvage some 
&gt; of the armor. Agian I don't feel the economy would be that 
&gt; interupted because it would balance out. 

&gt; Since when did only players take damage from falling? It's 
&gt; because of this that surefall only makes since in PvP combat. 
&gt; Against monsters it only ensures that you don't die from the 
&gt; fall. They won't hesistate from following you. 

&gt; This is another chance for realism, what's good for the goose is 
&gt; definately good for the gander. Either cause them to take damage 
&gt; and allow that to be a valid hunting technic or cause them to 
&gt; stop at the edge. Either way would be more in tune with true 
&gt; game balance and realism. 

&gt; And since when did monsters have the perfect direction sence? 
&gt; I've had ice boned skels chase me over hills, around mountians, 
&gt; and never loose track of me. And I thought I was a good ranger. 

&gt; I agree here too, though I see the reason for this. If you could 
&gt; loose the monsters then they would have to remain hating you 
&gt; till that spawn dies. Since leaving the zone is essentially 
&gt; loosing them in a sense. This would be difficult with memory of 
&gt; mobs and with the fact that the balance of the game would still 
&gt; be tilted. 

&gt; Bows on the other hand need a complete overhall. The attack 
&gt; rates are way too slow and the damage dosn't match what it 
&gt; should. Bows were suposed to be rangers and rogues trademark 
&gt; weapons, but as they stand they only have two good uses. The 
&gt; first is to tick off monsters and get them to attack you. The 
&gt; other, the only reason I keep using a bow, is a player can pop 
&gt; one or two shots into a fleeing monster and get them back into 
&gt; melee range. I also belive the minium range idea for a bow 
&gt; stinks. I'd much perfer to see bows getting interupted rather 
&gt; than see the &quot;I'm too close even though his back is turned 
&gt; to me&quot; message. The last complaint, as with throwing 
&gt; weapons, is please allow me to pull some of what I've unloaded 
&gt; into a monster off of his corpse. 

&gt; I think I agree with every point here. Though I think arrows 
&gt; once fired are pretty much lost. Since when a wooden arrow hit's 
&gt; something it's almost guarenteed that it'll shatter. On the 
&gt; otherhand shuriken's, daggers, spears and axes should be 
&gt; recoverable. Of course they might not be found and someone else 
&gt; might pick them up, but that would be part of the game.
