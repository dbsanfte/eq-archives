<P>Greetings, I am Millennium Skylarking, keeper of the old ways. Many of you may not even remember the old gods, the legend of the Lazarus Heart. It is a tragedy that these beliefs and memories have been stripped from Norrath.. I, however, have recovered some writings that show the path of the old ways as the true path.. I have yet to share this information with even my closest companion, Thundaarr Tundrascourge, but he knows I possess it.. What I ask of you is this.. if you want to follow the old gods, the true gods, the ones they want you to forget, then you have a place with us.. we call ourself The Lazarus Heart, after the very legend that forms the basis of our religion.. have you ever truly wondered who built the druidic ruins that are scattered across Norrath? It was the ancients who followed the old ways, there is no doubt.. they call me a pagan, they make me an outcast.. but I know the truth.. if I am to be labelled a pagan, then sobeit.. but I am a druid, and I will follow the path that has been set for my by my gods.. I urge you to at least find out more about the old ways before you dismiss them as the rantings of a deranged elf.. you will hear your name called from deep within the Lazarus Heart.. to give you a little info..

<P>Rydus was our savior.. he rose up and defeated the great evil that invaded his land with the help of the 11 amulets that make up the Lazarus Heart.. each amulet hold special powers in itself.. and when combined they form a device that is yet to be deciphered by my studies.. they are as follows
<P>The Amulet of Courage
<BR>The Amulet of Justice
<BR>The Amulet of Temperance
<BR>The Amulet of Wisdom
<BR>The Amulet of Faith
<BR>The Amulet of Charity
<BR>The Amulet of Hope
<BR>The Amulet of Earth
<BR>The Amulet of Fire
<BR>The Amulet of Water
<BR>The Amulet of Air
<P>every amulet was forged by their respective god, the names of which I cannot reveal at this time, lest I be hunted by certain ritualistic followers of a certain false god..
<P>each amulet is held by a member of the Lazarus Heart guild.. one that has shown the particular virtue of that amulet on many occasions.. the elemental amulets each being held by a special person with great responiblity for certain things, exactly what this means I have yet to discover.. but with time it will be told.. many of the amulets do not yet have bearers.. only the Amulet of Courage and the Amulet Charity have found their holders..
<P>We seek others who display these virtues and believe in the power of the old ways, or are at least willing to learn.. these people will take up an amulet at the proper time, and will be well respected within the guild and by all who follow the old gods..
<P>If you feel you could be one of these people, please email me at sirjohns@flash.net at your soonest opportunity..

<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=50 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; Greetings, I am Millennium Skylarking, 
&gt; keeper of the old ways. Many of you may not 
&gt; even remember the old gods, the legend of 
&gt; the Lazarus Heart. It is a tragedy that 
&gt; these beliefs and memories have been 
&gt; stripped from Norrath.. I, however, have 
&gt; recovered some writings that show the path 
&gt; of the old ways as the true path.. I have 
&gt; yet to share this information with even my 
&gt; closest companion, Thundaarr Tundrascourge, 
&gt; but he knows I possess it.. What I ask of 
&gt; you is this.. if you want to follow the old 
&gt; gods, the true gods, the ones they want you 
&gt; to forget, then you have a place with us.. 
&gt; we call ourself The Lazarus Heart, after the 
&gt; very legend that forms the basis of our 
&gt; religion.. have you ever truly wondered who 
&gt; built the druidic ruins that are scattered 
&gt; across Norrath? It was the ancients who 
&gt; followed the old ways, there is no doubt.. 
&gt; they call me a pagan, they make me an 
&gt; outcast.. but I know the truth.. if I am to 
&gt; be labelled a pagan, then sobeit.. but I am 
&gt; a druid, and I will follow the path that has 
&gt; been set for my by my gods.. I urge you to 
&gt; at least find out more about the old ways 
&gt; before you dismiss them as the rantings of a 
&gt; deranged elf.. you will hear your name 
&gt; called from deep within the Lazarus Heart.. 
&gt; to give you a little info.. 

&gt; Rydus was our savior.. he rose up and 
&gt; defeated the great evil that invaded his 
&gt; land with the help of the 11 amulets that 
&gt; make up the Lazarus Heart.. each amulet hold 
&gt; special powers in itself.. and when combined 
&gt; they form a device that is yet to be

&gt; follows 

&gt; The Amulet of Courage 
&gt; The Amulet of Justice 
&gt; The Amulet of Temperance 
&gt; The Amulet of Wisdom 
&gt; The Amulet of Faith 
&gt; The Amulet of Charity 
&gt; The Amulet of Hope 
&gt; The Amulet of Earth 
&gt; The Amulet of Fire 
&gt; The Amulet of Water 
&gt; The Amulet of Air 

&gt; every amulet was forged by their respective 
&gt; god, the names of which I cannot reveal at 
&gt; this time, lest I be hunted by certain 
&gt; ritualistic followers of a certain false 
&gt; god.. 

&gt; each amulet is held by a member of the 
&gt; Lazarus Heart guild.. one that has shown the 
&gt; particular virtue of that amulet on many 
&gt; occasions.. the elemental amulets each being 
&gt; held by a special person with great 
&gt; responiblity for certain things, exactly 
&gt; what this means I have yet to discover.. but
