<P>> It has been brought to my attention, not by

<BR>&gt; the person that posted, that someone was
<BR>&gt; slandering me on this forum. A knd soul
<BR>&gt; informed me of this sneaky person trying to
<BR>&gt; malign my character and I now have seen ft
<BR>&gt; to respond.
<P>&gt; To put it simply, many of the facts Kiron
<BR>&gt; has related are true, though lke most people
<BR>&gt; wanting to persuade others, he has left out
<BR>&gt; relevant facts. I did in fact try and coerce
<BR>&gt; him nto chargng matrket nstead of below
<BR>&gt; market prices for armor. What he neglected
<BR>&gt; to menton is that I tred to come to an
<BR>&gt; agreement with him in a civilized matter
<BR>&gt; before it degenrated into a war of sorts.
<BR>&gt; Let me state my opinons now that people have
<BR>&gt; had the opportunity to gossip about me lke a
<BR>&gt; bunch of old ladies.
<P>&gt; First to the people that defended me I am
<BR>&gt; greatful.
<P>&gt; Secondly my oddysey follows. For several
<BR>&gt; days of gameplay I estimate in the are of 90
<BR>&gt; hours of time, I killed creatures and dumped
<BR>&gt; all my money into smithing. I didnt buy
<BR>&gt; armor or weapons. I didnt level appreciably.
<BR>&gt; I smithed. I made over 1000 metal bits and
<BR>&gt; experimented wth what would rase my level
<BR>&gt; the cheapest way possble. I got hand cramps
<BR>&gt; and went through a whole bottle of advil.
<BR>&gt; Now I am one of the best smths in Norrath
<BR>&gt; though defer to Lani who went through simlar
<BR>&gt; trials and has me beat.
<P>&gt; Now for some reason people seem to think I
<BR>&gt; should shortcut them. I should tell them
<BR>&gt; what to make at whatever skill they are.
<BR>&gt; should bring them up to my level out of the
<BR>&gt; goodness of my heart. m a merchant, not a
<BR>&gt; prest. I didnt break my wrist so everyone
<BR>&gt; could benefit and not have to break theirs.
<BR>&gt; I learned it the hard way, anyone wanting to
<BR>&gt; catch me will have to as well. I wont give
<BR>&gt; them any pointers. Anyone that dosnt
<BR>&gt; understand this point is frankly not worth
<BR>&gt; my time. Go into Microsoft headquarters and
<BR>&gt; ask how they make their money and if they
<BR>&gt; will show you how to make a program as good
<BR>&gt; as theirs and market it. gather securty wll
<BR>&gt; be called. Shall commit industrial espionage
<BR>&gt; on myself ?
<P>&gt; I will not do trades with people because if
<BR>&gt; i did I would never get any money. I would
<BR>&gt; be constantly sellng this and that. My skill
<BR>&gt; rses when I smith. I cant make more product
<BR>&gt; without money.
<P>&gt; I routinely give away items. Today gave away
<BR>&gt; 4 cuthroat rings to newbies . I dont see
<BR>&gt; anyone else offering valuable merchandise
<BR>&gt; for free.
<P>&gt; I dont deliver. If I did I would spend the
<BR>&gt; whole night running from here to there and
<BR>&gt; miss many cuatomers. I stay at some common
<BR>&gt; locaton, lke the bank, and the customers
<BR>&gt; come to me. Once again Im not in smthy for
<BR>&gt; charity.
<P>&gt; I dont make armor if people give me the
<BR>&gt; materials. Take a bunch of silcon, some
<BR>&gt; wire, and other componets into Intel
<BR>&gt; corporate headquarters and say, "hey
<BR>&gt; here are the materals can you make me a
<BR>&gt; pentum for free?" Ths time i gather
<BR>&gt; your destination would be a psychiatric
<BR>&gt; ward. Why should I go through all the long
<BR>&gt; hours of hard work so you can have armor at
<BR>&gt; the costs of materals ? Am I n this game
<BR>&gt; just to help other people ? Am their slave ?
<BR>&gt; I will not be.
<P>&gt; I dont discount my prices unless you buy a
<BR>&gt; package item then usually ll give you a
<BR>&gt; break. If you are buyng one item the prce I
<BR>&gt; state is that which I want. Once again those
<BR>&gt; wht problems with my prices can consult
<BR>&gt; another smith.
<P>&gt; I dont have much patience for silly people.
<BR>&gt; When I auction "Banded Cloak AC8
<BR>&gt; 25pp" and 8 peopel ask me whats the
<BR>&gt; prce or whats the ac on it, I get a little
<BR>&gt; rritated. People that cant pay attenton are
<BR>&gt; hardly my fault. I put that information in
<BR>&gt; the auction because I get flooded with tells
<BR>&gt; and answerng that question 40 tmes ups my
<BR>&gt; workload and slows my response time to real
<BR>&gt; customers. These are paying customers, not
<BR>&gt; window shoppers. My responsablity is to the
<BR>&gt; people who are buying, not those trying to
<BR>&gt; pick my brain.
<P>&gt; Now back to the issue of pricing. No, I wont
<BR>&gt; sell a banded tunic for 20 platnum. Yes, the
<BR>&gt; materals cost me less then 10 platnum (of
<BR>&gt; you forget about the times i fail making
<BR>&gt; it). Why dont I sell the armor at low prices
<BR>&gt; then. Even bracers which I almost never
<BR>&gt; miss. Why do i mark it up. Two reasons
<BR>&gt; really. One, I can and stll sell. Supply and
<BR>&gt; demand works. Two, the principle of the
<BR>&gt; matter. I remember UO where everyone 2 days
<BR>&gt; old ran arouns in full plate. That was,
<BR>&gt; well, stupid. I wont sell to people under
<BR>&gt; level 5 and dont beleve they should be able
<BR>&gt; to afford the armor. First of all its dumb.
<BR>&gt; Second of all it makes all those that work
<BR>&gt; hard for their armor look lke complete
<BR>&gt; idiots. wll not be a party to super buffed 2
<BR>&gt; day old players at level 2 wearing full
<BR>&gt; banded. If they get given it by a guld
<BR>&gt; memeber or friend, fine, there is nothgn I
<BR>&gt; can do about that. If they transferred t
<BR>&gt; from anoher char have no problem wth that
<BR>&gt; since they worked for it in the first place.
<BR>&gt; However, I will not make it affordable to a
<BR>&gt; low level. Now every now and then I will gve
<BR>&gt; away armor items to lower players n a
<BR>&gt; publcity stunt. That is pure adverisement so
<BR>&gt; when they get the money they will remember
<BR>&gt; me.
<P>&gt; Kiron, for all his vaunted talk about
<BR>&gt; monopoly, was selling at prices so low a
<BR>&gt; level 5 could afford many tems wth minimal
<BR>&gt; discomfort. That is what bothered me. I
<BR>&gt; tried to talk to him lke a cvilized person
<BR>&gt; and his response was a two word phrase endng
<BR>&gt; with "off." Ill let you fll in the
<BR>&gt; blanks there. So I threatened him and dd n
<BR>&gt; fact bury him. I dont see him sellign at all
<BR>&gt; anymore makng my prediton of his banruptcy
<BR>&gt; prophecy. How would all you paladins that
<BR>&gt; paid 30 to 40 plat for your tuncs feel f
<BR>&gt; someone sautered up tellng you you were
<BR>&gt; stupd and he got his for 10 or 20 ? As for
<BR>&gt; the monopoly ? So what ? Mcrosoft does it,
<BR>&gt; why cant I ? If you cant stand the heat get
<BR>&gt; out of the kitchen. Business is a
<BR>&gt; dog-eat-dog competition. Corporatons are
<BR>&gt; daily ralroaded by other corporatons. It
<BR>&gt; happens. If you cant take it, go into the
<BR>&gt; clergy or somethng.
<P>&gt; Now for those customers willing to see these
<BR>&gt; points, I would be happy to sell you armor
<BR>&gt; at good prices and I can make every one of
<BR>&gt; the items in any size. For those of you that
<BR>&gt; think Im a jerk, thats fine, you are
<BR>&gt; entitled to your opnon and really dont need
<BR>&gt; you as customers anyway. m not so pressed
<BR>&gt; for money that i have to take abuse from
<BR>&gt; anyone.
<P>&gt; In concluson the VAST MAJORITY of my
<BR>&gt; customers are great people just trying to
<BR>&gt; have fun. apprecate them all. They see my
<BR>&gt; apprecaton in dscounts and bendng my rules
<BR>&gt; for them. thank them all for their business.
<BR>&gt; Customers that are rude or nasty to me I
<BR>&gt; promptly put on ignore. Nice feature that.
<P>&gt; Farewell and good luck.
<BR>&gt; Shiron, 142 skill smith.
<P>&gt; Send me a tell, Ill send you the prces =).
