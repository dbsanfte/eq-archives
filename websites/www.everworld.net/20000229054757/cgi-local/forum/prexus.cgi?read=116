<P>Spiros walks up to his nice new castle, the only building standing in this vacant world. The stench of death seems to permeate every orifice of this world. Some massive battle obviously occurred here. He drops the sack he is carrying and looks around. It was magnificent, and he loved it.

<P>Just as he was about to pick up his sack again he notices a small figure moving towards him. It was moving very fast, but not getting much bigger. He is soon able to make out the blond beard of a dwarf, a dwarf that is almost on him, and not slowing a bit. He is forced to jump aside just as the little whelp charges past him and through the door. All he hears as it passes is, "Noice place ya gut 'ere, Oi'll take tha basement."
<P>He turns to run after the dwarf, to ask what in the seven pits he was talking about, when a firm pale hand grasps his shoulder. He turns to see a darkly clad human with a rather nasty sword in his hand. "I'll be taking one of these towers if you don't mind. No, I'm sure you don't," he says grasps his sword a little firmer. Before Spiros can say anything, not even remotely afraid of the threat, the man walks by him and through the now open doors.
<P>Absolutely infuriated Spiros is about to summon his strongest skeleton when a troll strolls out of nowhere. With a stupid look on his face and a large axe in his hand the brute says, "Ug der, Me N'Grulk, Me moobin in. Lat nub gonna do nuttin tu stup me right." Not waiting for a response, or forgetting he was in a conversation, he lumbers past the dark elf and into the castle.
<P>Spiros drops the chips without casting his spell and slumps his shoulders in defeat. With no hope of living in his prestigious castle alone he bends over and grabs up his bags. Before he can even stand up again he feels a small hand in his robe. Turning in a flash he is quickly holding a small halfling two feet of the ground, and dangling from one arm. "Ey, I didn't mean any trouble, no sir. I was just, well, takin a peek ya know. I surely wasn't going to take anything, no sir. If'n you would put me down, I promise I'll not be takin anything from you. No sir, I don't break me promises. Um also, if you'd not be to upset, I'd like to takin up residence in this nice place here."
<P>Spiros drops the little guy lightly on his feet, and points into through the door with his head bowed, "Ya, sure, go on in, make yourself at home, everyone else is." The halfling jumps up and with a broad grin on his face and bolts through the large oaken doors, with a little hoot.
<P>Spiros looks around suspiciously, expecting someone else to pop out of nowhere before he can even get into his new home. He spins around several times until he is satisfied then walks over the threshold. Once again he turns around to peer out the door, waiting for someone he knew had to be coming to show up. Realizing that the longer he waited the more likely someone would show up he turned and closed the doors.
<BR>Just as he managed the second one shut, he heard a little knock. He spun around a few times, until he was sure. Opening the door he just closed up a crack he saw the light face of a wood elf girl. She had a light cape on and some leather armor, strapped to her back was well crafted longbow. She was smiling when he first saw her, but as soon as she got a look at him she held a look of shock, "Oh dear, I'm sorry, I didn't realize, I mean..." she stops and blushes a bit placing her hand over her mouth. "Excuse me, but I was under the impression that a half elf lived here. My name is E'gaile, he would know me, I think he would."
