<P>

<BR>This has been a very interesting thread, because it hits some very valid points.
<P>First, of course, is anyone telling anyone else how to play their character. Character development should include thinking up background information, motivations, and the little details that make the difference. Assuming that was done, and the character is played true to his initial conception (evolving as he grows, of course), then *that* is the right way to play your character.
<P>True, all the Drizzt-style Tier'Dal are annoying. My guess is that a lot of the people playing characters like that haven't had a lot of experience with role-playing and creating characters. They shouldn't be slammed for lacking imagination. They should be encouraged and nurtured for at least *trying* to roleplay.
<P>Another very important point to show up was the differences among religions. A Paladin of Brell should act totally different than a paladin of Prexus. There's, of course, no reason that two paladins of Brell should approach their devotions and duties the same way, either. Look at all the squabbling among the different churches of Christianity.
<P>I think another possible point was ignored, though. What about a pair who should be diametrically opposed, but have the same goal? This would pretty much have to be some kind of quest, and should probably end in a duel (maybe to the death, maybe not). But it's *full* of role-playing possibilities.
<P>So, what's my final conclusion? Don't jump to conclusions. Cut people some slack, and give them the benefit of the doubt. I've rarely found that to be a mistake.

<P>&gt; Ok, I've been looking through some things,
<BR>&gt; and I guess your specific combination
<BR>&gt; wouldn't have been wrong. Your dark elf
<BR>&gt; friend was one of the spurned, and thus
<BR>&gt; really wasn't good enough to kiss Innoruuks
<BR>&gt; feet. Of those who can be agnostic, only the
<BR>&gt; spurned could be sick enough to try and make
<BR>&gt; relations with the lesser races. Our
<BR>&gt; warriors are not stupid enough to think they
<BR>&gt; can gain anything from the lesser races. The
<BR>&gt; same holds true with our rogues.
<P>&gt; But that still doesn't mean someone can't
<BR>&gt; come up and say: "By the gods, why are
<BR>&gt; you with that scum. Teir'dal bastards like
<BR>&gt; that don't deserve to live." Or,
<BR>&gt; "You worthless paladin wretch, how
<BR>&gt; could you possibly think you could be good
<BR>&gt; enough to walk in the same path as one the
<BR>&gt; dark races. You should die for your
<BR>&gt; insolence." Of course only if they do
<BR>&gt; it in a RP way, and let it go after you
<BR>&gt; explain it.
