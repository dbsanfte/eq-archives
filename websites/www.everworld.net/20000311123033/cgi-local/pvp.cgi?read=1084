<P>Ok let me make this statement first. I have never played EQ. I am however waiting franticly for its rerlease. I do however play UO and did play Diablo till the cheats became unbearable.

<BR>My bigest problem with PvP is its mis-use. I play a character in Uo and beleive it or not never start a fight aginest another player but have been droped by a few pkers in my life there. I managed to drop one or two but far fewer than those that droped me. I like the challenge of making my way through the world looking behind by back it keeps me on my toes. Some of the bigest rushes i have had have been in PvP situations, also some of the worst. The thing i guess that really needs to be solved from the post i read here is basicly this. To what degree do we allow PvP to grow or become part of EQ.
<BR>I feel it is an important part of the online experences to both fear and become feared in the PvP realm. Characters need a chance to develope befor becoming discouraged and unfair ganging on lone players could be curbed to some degree im sure. Bottom line is this if your really a PvP player you dont mind taking on a fair fight or even an unfair one. exploits and random killing of very low lvl chars must be stoped period. all other forms of PVP i think we can live with.
<BR>If your blocked or trap and an NPC kills you them a exploit from a ass kidd did it. Do we have a place for that in Eq sociaity.
<BR>If so what kind of penilties do we need to impose?..
<P>Set a standard an a fair minded bunck of PvP players not a pker gone wild group... Pick a side you the beta testers have the best chance to set this game on its path of all of us.. Use it wisely...
