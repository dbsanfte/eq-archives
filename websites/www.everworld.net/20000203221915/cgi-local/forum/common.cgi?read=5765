<P>The Gospel According to McQuaid

<P>1. In the beginning was McQuaid,
<BR>2. and McQuaid moved across the face of Norrath and
<BR>3. found that it was good.
<BR>4. And he ventured out and examined
<BR>5. the creatures and inhabitants,
<BR>6. and found that they were good.
<P>7. And he practiced his many skills,
<BR>8. and found that the fruits were also good.
<P>9. Thus it was that he came to invite in the many
<BR>10. souls who would be born unto the world of Norrath.
<P>11. There was much rejoicing,
<BR>12. and many people calling in sick.
<P>13. Alas, and though much was good, the living beings
<BR>14. of Norrath sinned in the face of McQuad, for
<BR>15. they paid not a tithe of $12, nor a tithe of
<BR>16. $11, but a mere tithe of $10 per month.
<P>17. And so McQuaid, the Lord most Codely,
<BR>18. spake unto the people, saying
<BR>19. "Fear ye the McQuaid; I shall tweak the
<BR>20. creatures which might provide ye with good loot,
<BR>21. I shall cry the cause of those who would travel
<BR>22. but I shall truly reward those who camp.
<BR>23. And my minions shall be trained in that they
<BR>24. blame everything on 'the vagueries of the Internet'. For ye have sinned in my sight."
<P>25. And the people trembled;
<P>26. And the people noticed each other trembling and
<BR>27. laughed at one another for the animation was broken.
<P>28. Yet again, McQuaid spake through signs and
<BR>29. tribulations to his people, saying
<BR>30. "Ye shall bow before the McQuaid, saying
<BR>31. 'Oh, McQuaid, make unto us an expansion pack
<BR>32. for which we might pay you more money'."
<P>33. And McQuaid sayeth unto the people "I shall torment
<BR>34. ye now; I shall design the entrance to Norrath so
<BR>35. that you are forever tormented in entering it."
<P>36. "For the buttons", declared McQuaid, "shall be as
<BR>37. un to no other buttons anywhere. And though wilt
<BR>38. have to alternate between mouse and keyboard.
<BR>39. And when you find yourself blasted from the lands
<BR>40. of Norrath to the afterlife of windows unexpectedly,
<BR>41. much torment and pain and suffering shall I bestow
<BR>42. upon thee when thou trieth to return unto Norrath."
<P>43. And the people looked blankly at each other.
<P>44. "Aye!" declared McQuaid, as an ambulance pulled
<BR>45. up outside and men with white jackets began to pile out.
<BR>46. "Aye!" he bellowed, "and I shall withdraw from you
<BR>47. your access unto Norrath, without forewarning. Then
<BR>48. shall I conceal from the the duration or the reasoning,
<BR>49. until once again thou might return unto Norrath".
<P>50. The people quivered as McQuad cackled.
<P>51. "Because you have sinned in my sight, because you would
<BR>52. not pay me $20 a month, I shall see to it that
<BR>53. never again wilt thou enjoy your EverQuest experience.
<BR>54. It shall be as addiction unto thee, and it shall be a
<BR>55. pricely and painful addiction".
<P>56. Finally the people knelt before McQuaid and cried out
<BR>57. to him "Asheron's Call! Asheron's Call! What wilt
<BR>58. thou do, Lord McQuaid, when we can show you how
<BR>59. fed up we are and go play a MICROSOFT game???"
<P>60. But McQuaid was unavailable for comment, the men in
<BR>61. white jackets having finished wrapping him snugly in
<BR>62. his straightjacket and carting him off to the assylum.
