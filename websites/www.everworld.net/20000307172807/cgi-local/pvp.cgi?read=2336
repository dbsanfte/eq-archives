<P>> First thing first there is no such thing as a balanced class.

<BR>&gt; Wizards Enchanters and Druids are PVP gods!!! While warriors,
<BR>&gt; rogues, and magicians are at the bottom of the food chain. All
<BR>&gt; others are somewhere in the middle. Evidence of this is the mass
<BR>&gt; creation of druids and enchanters. I took my own little private
<BR>&gt; poll and 17% of all new players on the pvp servers are druids.
<BR>&gt; Another 12% are enchanters. Now go on a non pvp server and only
<BR>&gt; 2% are enchanters and 12% druids. What the hell is that. I can
<BR>&gt; admit that there are also alot of warriors but that doesnt make
<BR>&gt; up for the lack of rogues. I counted 3 rogues, lower than level
<BR>&gt; 8, on the entire pvp server. I don't even want to talk about
<BR>&gt; magicians and how unbalanced they are...What the hell is the
<BR>&gt; point of summoning arrows if you cant use them? To give them to
<BR>&gt; a ranger who will later probably end up killing you?
<P>&gt; Now I want to know if eq will ever be made more balanced than it
<BR>&gt; is? Dont tell me this is the grass is always greener syndrome
<BR>&gt; cause i have level 25 rogue 27 enchanter and 30 magician. out of
<BR>&gt; all of these my enchanter is most deadly. My magician cant even
<BR>&gt; take on a level 26 druid!!!!! Is anyone else with me on this.
<P>A-men brother I play a magician on rallos zek and I get the worst spells. I am lvl 13 and still using my lvl 8 dd and bolt spells cause I don't get a new dd spell to lvl 16. that means at lvl 15 I am going to be using spells that hit for 36 dmg and bolts that hit for 47. What's up with this the magician dmg is tottaly screwwed up
<BR>They give magicians area spells like rain and area spells that hurt there pet when cast. I thought the whole point of being a magician was to stand behind your pet and cast spells. How'bout giving us some spells to cast so that we can bring up the class even thing.
<BR>How bout maken it so are spells are stronger and consume less mana? Right now I would go for any new spells at all. you have no idea how old lvl 8 spells get when ur wizzie friend does 2wice the dmg. On the other hand though my pet can solo a wizzie. hehe
<P>And lets not even talk about a rogue. come on all the cool things on a rogue are like lvl 50... Have you ever tried to lvl a rogue up to 12!!! Plus evrytime they give them something cool they take it away. And warriors less not even go there.
<P>I'm just sayin that some classes need to be recized cause all the magician spell changes Ive seen are like at lvl 50. Less try to make the classes even. And I personally think that the wizzie spells should not hurt other players as much. At higher lvls it only takes 2 spells for a wizzie to burn your eyes out. Is the reason they did this so they could take npc's? And as for bards how does playing ur flute hurt somebody?.... E-mail me at Skrpnjam@aol.com
