<P>The frisky rogue feels a lite brush against his shoulder, followed by the sound of footsteps. The seat next to him hobbles then stands still. Slowly a form begins to solidify in it. The commonly known features of the crazy druid show through the haze, but they seem differant. As the image becomes clearer, it becomes obvious that his skin is much darker then it should be, and his eyes blaze with a fire literally. It is becoming plainfully obvious that the mad half elf has changed somewhat since last he had been seen.

<P>"Hail squirt, you look a bit surprised to see me. It's the skin isn't it. Everyone keeps acting the same way. Well this is what I get for following the berserk shadow night. Declare fealty to Innoruuk, get blessed by a hateful god, and you'd look the same way. You have no idea how hard it is to get in here now though. Oh, and it's Spiros now, how ya been."
<P>OOC:
<BR>Considering when I made that statement, I think it was rather well placed. This board still sees little to no action. Of course I do hope that changes, as I'm sure we all do. Oh and to clarify my message, I'm a level two dark elf necromancer now, who is unable to play EQ, for reasons heretofore unknown, though I think it is my modem. I made level two by shear luck, and of course could not cast invisibility as is shown somewhat in the story, but tough. It's always fun to ramble here.
