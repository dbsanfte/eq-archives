<P>> See thats the key thing, the PvP server gives players the

<BR>&gt; ultimate freedom to play as they see fit. Just as you choose to
<BR>&gt; kill DE's as an ogre, AOD can choose to be kewl PKzor Dudes..
<P>&gt; Like I said before, if people cant handle the diversities you
<BR>&gt; get with a chaotic server, then simply dont play there.
<P>You got it, man. I consider myself a _serious_ roleplayer, but I wouldn't play anywhere but Rellos. You just can't behave in character without the ability to fight other PC's, IMO. Even if you're a total peacenik, there's no point to your role if no one can actually do anything other than what you espouse. And, again, IMO, PVP balances things much better than non-PVP. Losers can come in on a non-pvp server and harass you, and you can't do anything back to them. In PVP, if enough epople agree with you, you can fix things.
<P>Just today, some dork came in shouting about his plans to go to a club that evening. Wow, we were all impressed that he was so mature that he could go to a bar! (/me refills his glass of single malt from the bottle on his desk and grins.) So we told him to shut up and use tell, we didn't want to hear his crap, and if he couldn't at least try to act like he was part of the world, he should split. He starts talking a line about how 'you are a bunch of role player losers'. So we went and whacked his stupid ass repeatedly until he left crying. That's how things should work. If you piss off enough people, they come and beat you down. And IMO, it's not too hard to piss of an Ogre. ;)
<P>These people saying PVP is somehow antithetical to RP are plain stupid, IMO. I'm an ogre, and I worship a war god. If I don't like you, and I think I can get away with it, I should beat the shit out of you, plain and simple. And if I just go around whacking anyone I please, then a bunch of other people are going to come after me, take me out, and steal my loot, so I have to act as if I have some sense and not make enemies out of everyone who crosses my path. Murderous psychos will get what they deserve in the end.
<P>But on the 'psycho killers should go back to Quake' issue, I actually agree. Look at it like this: a wannabe psycho killer comes in as first level. What's he going to do? There's lots more people tougher than him. He's pretty much guaranteed to get smoked on a regular basis. People will be gunning for him. How's he ever going to get any levels if every time he shows his face in the newbie grounds, someone takes him out and loots his gear? It's not like he can every be so skilled that he can come in with a new character and beat, say, a third or fourth level even. Which means he basicly has to pay some dues and learn how to get along with people before he will ever be able to go on a rampage, anyway. If that's all he is in it for, then he's going to be pretty bored just beating up on monsters to get powerful. Quake is a way better game for just joining up and kicking some ass.
