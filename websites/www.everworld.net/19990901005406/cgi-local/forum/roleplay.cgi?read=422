<P>*...Fen leans his chair against the wall, his feet thrown up on the table, his hands clasped lightly behind his ruffled head, eyes closed in relaxation. It'd been awhile since he'd set foot back in Freeport after the "incident", but so far nothing had made him think his choice to return to his home had been one made in bad judgement. The guards didn't seem to recognize him (though he surely recognized one of the slow witted dolts he'd dumped in the drink those months ago), and, as far as he could make out, no one seemed to be eyeing him in any manner that made him want to go for his daggers.*

<P>*Sniffing, he opened his eyes and peered around the place, noticing how little the small, stinking tavern has changed since his leave. Ah well, he couldn't say he'd changed much in the time he'd been away. Gods, it would nearly be laughable to say he'd changed at all.*
<P>"Everything's just right as rain," Fen murmurs to himself, pleased, "nice to be back."
<P>*Leaning back against that wall, the rogue is just about ready to close his eyes for a second short siesta when the door to the outside opens and closes with a catch. Glancing almost none caringly at the new arrival, Fen at first nearly doesn't realize exactly who it is he's looking at.*
<P>*Nearly sliding off his chair, Fen stumbles to sit up without looking like a man struck stupid.*
<P>"Geezum crow!" he spits through gritted teeth.
<P>The Purse Snatching Bastard hath returned...
<P>--- OOC: Ah. Really, good to be back on the ol' RolePlay forum. As usual, Fen's timing is perfect, as it appears that both Gradnon&Trescar, as well as Cathal, have both decided to make sudden appearances as well. Don't smack me around, but I still haven't been able to purchase a retail copy of EQ (sorry Cathal, I'm still looking forward to seeing you in Freeport). However, it's a good possibility that I will be showing up in Norrath some time this week. Freakin' harrah. If anyone's interested in helping a newbie rouge get his footings, I'd be most greatful! And by the by, Sprio, I happen to disagree with what you've said. This board certainly does have uses. It's a great place to come and tell of EQ adventures after the fact, in true character of course. As well, it's also a nice corner to visit. ---
