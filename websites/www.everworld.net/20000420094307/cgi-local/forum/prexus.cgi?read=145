<P>Slowly Spiros walks slowly in a mist. Something had happened, he couldn't remember what it was. He had died before, but he remembered that. Why was he having trouble this time. He remembered a girl. Wood elf? No, not this time. Only half an elf. Why was she there? They had made something. They had joined a part of eachother and gave birth to something older then some of the races. Why? It was evil. Was she evil? No, they never are. She was pure, like the last one. Why was she there?

<P>Spiros knew he could remember, but it was so hard. The mist was everywhere, everything was the same. He couldn't see anything, he couldn't tell if he had even gone anywhere, or how long he had been walking. He has to keep thinking, if he stops he will forget.
<P>It was a tree. How can a tree be evil? Was it the girl that made it evil? It was the girls fault the last time. No, she tried to save him. She tried to stop it. Why did he think it was her fault? Who was she? Who were either of them? Kitaira. He remembered that name, but which one was she? It must have been the second one, his feelings weren't as strong for that name. What was he doing with her? They made a tree. An evil tree. How could a tree be evil? It must have been him. He was a Teir'dal now, he was a necromancer. He was evil. It was his fault, it was all his fault. He was dead. It had killed him. He remembered. Yes, Keshik. That was why they made it. They stopped him, and started something else. They made evil.
<P>He stopped walking and looked up. Before him he saw a figure, it looked familiar. It was enormous compared to him, it's whole body was gnarled. It's head grotesque. Slowly it looks down at him. It looks like it wants to grin, but it can't. Instead it scowls at him and speaks. Spiros cringes expecting a booming voice, but instead hears a soft voice from somewhere in his head.
<P>"You have pleased me Spiros. That is not an easy thing to do. I have been trying to corrupt the peoples of your world. I have been trying to create the tree again. But I could not. You have done it. You, my creation, have brought about my ultimate horror on the world. The embodyment of my hatred. You need but ask and it will be yours."
<P>Spiros looked at him. He knew who he was, he had seen him once before. The last time he died. When the other girl had been there. What had happened to her? She tried to stop it. Was she dead to? The thought put a knot in his throat. "Where is she?" He tries to ask, but can barely make the words.
<P>Again the figure opens it's mouth, and again the voice speaks in his head. "She is gone. She tried to stop me, to stop you. She was to weak. You killed her yourself, so I would finish my work."
<P>Spiros suddenly felt like he had been cut in two. Tears began falling from his face. "No! I couldn't have done that! You're lying to me." He knew who this was. He knew what power it held. He didn't care anymore. "I am not yours, I am not your creation. I am Spiro. I loved her. Do you hear that Innoruuk? I loved her!"
<P>The figures face curled up in rage. Spiros looked up at it with the upmost defiance. It openned it's mouth again, spit foaming on it's tongue. This time it spoke. It screamed out at him, "YOU LOVED? YOU THINK YOU COULD POSSIBLY LOVE? YOU THINK YOU UNDERSTAND LOVE? YOU ARE OF MY CHILDREN, YOU ARE TEIR'DAL, YOU DO NOT LOVE." Slowly it stood, towering over anything that might have existed. Spiros watched it, this mighty thing, it could not even stand errect. When it's balance was again on it's feet the thrown it had occupied disappeared in the mist. Slowly it lifted a hand and in an instant it was occupied by horrible staff. An orb on it's end sent bolts of lightning in all directions.
<P>"I defy you prince of hatred. You are not my father. I remember what I was. I remember what I am. My father was human. My mother was a priestess of Tunare. I am not your servant!" Spiros lifted his hand as well and in it he held an old gnarled staff. Ornate runes and pictures carved all along it's length. The figure bellowed in rage, the sound sent Spiros to his knees, barely able to hold his staff. Suddenly moving fast the figure jumped away a hundred feet and pointed the orb on his staff at Spiros. "THEN YOU WILL DIE!!" As if ordered by his words the staff errupts with light, as a shocking blast fire forth headed to Spiros.
<P>Spiros lifts his staff in defence and the bolt strikes five feet from him, raping around an invisible orb that now sorrounded him. "I am already dead. You can not harm me."
<P>"YOU THINK I HAVE NO POWER OVER THE DEAD?" The bolt continues pouring out of his staff, getting thicker and thicker, until it spreads completely around Spiros' orb of protection. It slowed turns a light crimson seeming more like blood then anything else. Sweat beads up on Spiros' brow as the bolt starts to jump inside his shield. It strikes him in the leg and he is on the ground. He manages to hold his staff up, and the orb holds. It strikes his chest and he can't breath. Clutching at his chest with his free hand he continues to hold up his staff. "I will not yeild!" It strikes his arm. He holds the staff firm. It strikes again and again, he can't take the pain. Just as he loses his grip, the bolt stops.
<P>His staff disappears before it hits the ground. He looks up. He can no longer see Innoruuk. Infront of him is a lady. She seems more like a plant then a person. Even in her strange figure she was quite stunning. She looks down at him with a scowl masked with love. "I am Tunare. I remember you Spiro. I remember you mother as well. I know what you've been through. You have done some terrible things. You have done the most evil of things. But you remain noble. You have always been one of my children. Even when you were coersed over to Innoruuks side. I forgive you that. But I can not fogive what you have done. You must set things right, so that you may come again into my grace. I know you will try. I can not heal your body, but I can heal your soul."
<P>She reaches down and as her hand touches his forehead she is no taller than him. She does not speak a word, she does not need to. Her hand begins glowing and then his whole body does. Her face fades away from his vision as a glare of red turns to blue, then green, then white. Then as he continues watching the colors, all goes black.
