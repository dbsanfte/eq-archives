<P>> Yup I and over 40 others tried pvp for around 2 weeks or so. We

<BR>&gt; have firmly decided against it. Not so much because of random
<BR>&gt; slaying but what we saw the server evolving into. There was no
<BR>&gt; sense at all of being in Norrath, it was simply another set of
<BR>&gt; rules for powergaming guilds to assert thier bragging rights at
<BR>&gt; the cost of any players around them.
<P>Well, PVP server will have unique players, maybe you started wrong on it. I and others who would like to play on it enjoy its freedom.
<P>&gt; heh, never found being too high level a problem!
<P>:)
<P>&gt; Yeh looting from pve deaths needs to be fixed. IE: if some dewd
<BR>&gt; decides my staff looks good as I am near dead from a dervish, he
<BR>&gt; should only be able to loot if he does the normal 51%+ damage
<BR>&gt; required in pve. Maybe not realistic but the benefits would
<BR>&gt; outweigh the losses. This would stop a lot of the random killing
<BR>&gt; motivate by nothing other than greed.
<P>Good idea, I read this somewhere else too.. but that limits the game even more... I mean CHECK area before you attack monster... emm "whats that guy doing there sitting and watching at me doing"....cmon I mean..and so what if he does this? Come back and take your staff back.
<P>&gt; Unfortunately the vast majority of the hardcore pvp's here don't
<BR>&gt; want to play in character. In fact the vehemently complain\flame
<BR>&gt; if anything is suggested to hinder their ability to kill whoever
<BR>&gt; they want without ingame consequences. They keep preaching for a
<BR>&gt; player enforced system which I doubt will work well enough to
<BR>&gt; keep anyone but themselves playing on the server.
<P>Yes, Limitatins ruin games...well not, but too much do! Player ruled server would be a best thing ever to happen to online gaming, with GM's just making sure that noone cheats.
<P>&gt; Read Tarquins post, it appears some see the world of EQ as
<BR>&gt; nothing more than xp numbers and obstacles in their way of
<BR>&gt; dominating other players.
<P>No, I see Everquest as much more, but it lacks A lot of things..look at game, its just a map with monsters on it.. You can't interact with it at all! You don't have freedom of tasks that one can do..for example fire walls in UO, or cutting down a tree..
<BR>No i dont need to hear another "Go play UO then".. I am saying I know Everquest is beautiful I was swiming in ocean of tears looking to find something noone else found like some underwater cave.... Its vast world, but I dont want more limitations to the game...
<P>&gt; I agree this wouldn't have worked on a pvp server. In almost
<BR>&gt; every guild post here, none of its about making a better
<BR>&gt; experience in EQ. Its about guild power struggles and bragging
<BR>&gt; rights.
<P>Sigh... look play on normal server, don't come here and start ruining PVP server.... if it goes down these "stupid juvenile CoOl DOoDz" will come on normal servers.... which is just a stupid stereotype of PVP server.
<BR>&gt; Gieger I totally agree with your sentiments but really believe
<P>&gt; its a lost cause. Perhaps its time to give the pvp's their guild
<BR>&gt; war platform server and concentrate on the other things
<BR>&gt; mentioned by Ryan a while back. A server of pvp's by definition
<BR>&gt; aren't ever going to be interested in much in grand plots and
<BR>&gt; rping storylines. I certainly hope such things could make them
<BR>&gt; see more depth in EQ, but I am skeptical.
<P>How can you say this? I was seeking quests in phase 4 a part of time! You are so baised, and you speculate too much. You threat all people who actually want more risk and more fun out of game as some moronic kids who just want to kill.
<P>&gt; I think you'll find the majority of people who left the pvp in
<BR>&gt; disgust are much more interest in that old militia idea or some
<BR>&gt; sort of rp-pvp switch. Not so much because they fear getting
<BR>&gt; killed, but is seems obvious such tools are needed to make the
<BR>&gt; game resemble the EQ we all love.
<P>&gt; I've been flamed for it before here, I'll say it again:) The
<BR>&gt; attitude of most pvps is that if "you don't like it then
<BR>&gt; leave". PVP's expect everyone to conform to their
<BR>&gt; powergaming style, they never once think to maybe give a little
<BR>&gt; back to the game in hopes of making pvp better and maybe even
<BR>&gt; something more interesting than it was in UO.Oh well with the
<BR>&gt; current attitude, its becoming the same UO style of pvp and I
<BR>&gt; and most have met are bored to tears with it.
<P>&gt; In short I think you are preaching to the wrong crowd, but I
<BR>&gt; hope you can promote some change.
<P>Let PVP server be, if people play on it they play on it because they like the environment, dont come here trying to promote its closure!
<P>&gt; Chris praying for another switch option
<P>NO MORE SWITCHES!
