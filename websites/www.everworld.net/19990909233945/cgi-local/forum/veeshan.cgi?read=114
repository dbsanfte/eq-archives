<P>Hail and well met!

<P>I want to thank all who responded to my posting the other day about Monopolies. This includes the Negative posts as well as the Positive ones. Of course, the positive posts show your support for my cause and I thank you. I had a lot of in-game /tells from people. People I haven't even met. People who live on the other side of Norrath! These people all said that they agreed with my views about not FORCING others into set prices. They said they support my cause and were even willing to travel all the way from Qeynos to sample my wares.
<P>Now, I am not one to turn down business, but it is not necessary for you to travel a far distance just to buy from me. The post was not meant to increase my business, it was meant to decrease Shiron's business. Actually, the point was to let everyone know what he was up to about FORCING set prices and regulating the market. Him losing business would only be a result of the truth that I provided. Anyway, you are all welcome to come to Faydwer if you like. Yesterday I had a goal and completed the goal. In addition to making Banded Gorgets, Bracers, Boots, Helm, Sleeves and Mask; I am proud to announce that I can also make Leggings and Tunic. (Yes, they come in Medium and Small sizes. Barbarians can wear the Medium Banded as well. No Ogres or Trolls though. Need Large molds for that, not found on Faydwer.) This is a monumental step for me. No longer will you have to pay outragous prices for these items. Not as long as I am available to make them!
<P>Please forgive me for not posting my prices here, but I have to protect myself. I do not want to start any price war and I do not want any "certain" smiths (cough cough Shiron cough couch) to adjust their prices just because of me. Like I have stated time and time again, my prices are as low as I can put them. The are fair to both you and me. Thank you all again for your interest and support! Long live Tunare! Long live Mithanial Marr! long live the good people of Norrath!
