</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> I have played some on the PvP shard as well as fought a lot of

<BR>&gt; duels in 3.0. I have a lot of experience in PvP within EQ and
<BR>&gt; have a few suggestions for the dev team.
<BR>&gt; 1) I don't feel that anyone should be PvP+ until at least level
<BR>&gt; 5 because it is hard enough to try and start out with the
<BR>&gt; monsters doing more damage to you now, let alone trying to fight
<BR>&gt; off people as well. I think that once a character hits level 5
<BR>&gt; they should automatically be PvP+.
<BR>&gt; 2) Right now the 5 level difference in my opinion is WAY too
<BR>&gt; much of a lead for that person who is level 5 and the person who
<BR>&gt; is level 1. Also I have tested damage of medium level characters
<BR>&gt; and had feedback from high level characters and 5 level
<BR>&gt; difference is WAY too much. For one, the magic casters fighting
<BR>&gt; someone that is 5 levels higher will NEVER get a spell through
<BR>&gt; to do damage, and even at 3 levels higher, the spell caster will
<BR>&gt; be lucky to get 50% of his spells to go through, what I mean is
<BR>&gt; the higher level character will most likely resist every spell.
<BR>&gt; Another thing is the straight mele classes. 5 levels for a
<BR>&gt; fighter is 100-150 hp more than their opponent not to mention
<BR>&gt; the attack and defense factor and with mele doing a lot more
<BR>&gt; damage, the person who is 5 levels lower will die in seconds. In
<BR>&gt; other words, the way that it is set up now, whoever gets to the
<BR>&gt; higher level will dominate. Now people will say that you can
<BR>&gt; make groups to go and take the person out, but what if you all
<BR>&gt; the people who play non stop are 5 levels higher and group up to
<BR>&gt; kill all the lower level people? My suggestion is this, that
<BR>&gt; instead of being 5 levels difference, you make it 1-3 levels
<BR>&gt; difference because with this ratio there is a better chance of
<BR>&gt; the lower level person winning or surviving long enough to zone.
<P>&gt; These are just a few of the suggestions I have and would love to
<BR>&gt; have feedback on them if anyone wishes to do so.
<BR>&gt; Thanks,
<BR>&gt; Galford Teveril of Covetous Crew
<P>Agree with you that is nice temporary fix
<P>anyone can attack anyone over your level no matter what .. (crazy but why not?) maybe they think they will have a chance when you are very very hurt.. and yea for now make it -2 or -3 levels to attack maximum but this will make finding people to fight pretty hard thing to do especially later in game....so this is just short temporary fix to let people advance in game...but then what will happen is a group of 5-10 people won't really pvp a lot and will just advance faster and will get about 10 levels higher than everyone else (since they work in efficient group) and thye will be able to kick everyones ass later on if changes are made with level limits (for example, level difference is tweaked and now its +-10 or so(waay too much but who knows how levels can me modified or even taken away)
<P>the ultimate goal would be to get rid of them...but heh

&gt; this is just short temporary fix to let people advance in

&gt; really pvp a lot and will just advance faster and will get about 
&gt; 10 levels higher than everyone else (since they work in 
&gt; efficient group) and thye will be able to kick everyones ass
