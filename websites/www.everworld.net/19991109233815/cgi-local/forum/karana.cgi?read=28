<P>I have had a similar problem with a rude little Gnome Wizard called KOBAIN on the Karana server. He approached me and asked me to play a practical joke on a friend, and for it, he would pay me 5 platinum. I agreed, and his “friend” showed up a few minutes later. KOBAIN insisted that an almost worthless totem had great powers and asked me as a “total stranger” to confirm this. I spewed out the lines that KOBAIN had me write down, and the poor guy bought the totem for 35 platinum.

<P>He laughed at his “friend’s” gullibility, and I laughed as well. I asked him for the 5 platinum he owed me, and he told me that he had just scammed a perfect stranger by doing a “Who wiz all” and finding a higher level player out of the list, contacting them , and convincing them to buy his worthless item. By pulling this scam, he had almost 500 plat in the bank, and my new knowledge of scamming people was payment enough he told me. I was outraged, more because I had been duped like a fool to be honest, but this foul person had obviously done this NUMEROUS times. When I continued to insist that he pay me, he told me that if I talked to him again, he would report me. I told him to go right ahead and report me, because doing so would be reporting your own thieving way, and I’m pretty sure that he has no intention of letting GMs know that he is thieving from the players! I contacted the other poor person that was taken for the 35 plat, and he was angry as much as I. He petitioned a GM, and I do not know what happened with him from there.
<P>So, of course I hotkeyed a shout warning others of KOBAIN. I have had almost 20 direct tells to me, telling me that KOBAIN has wronged them too. I have even sent the screenshots of KOBAIN’s words via Email to one player. (Of course I took screenshots, you shouldn’t open your mouth without proof).
<P>One of the morals of this story is: There are scam artists willing to make you a fool and steal your money, taking advantage of your good nature, so beware! And if you see a little Gnome Wizard on the Karana server named KOBAIN, beware his treachery, or count your fingers and toes after you deal with him!
