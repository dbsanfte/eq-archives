<P>A prime example of killing out of role would be a Human Paladin man Killing a Human Paladin Female 5 lvls below him. That is a somewhate stretched example however, I personally won't accept the "I'm role playing a vicious Psycho Paladin Domestic Violence oriented Murderer". Rules will be built around PvP, the closer we come to fine tune Role PLaying PvP the less restrictions I forsee being on PvP. This game doesn't inherently support sensless killing and althout it may happen in certain cases, I believe most will agree that it will be dealt with in some way shape or fasion. Time will tell what happens.

<P>Geiger
<P>Am concerned on very last thing you said how you frown upon such
<BR>&gt; random mindless killing... are you gonna favouritize players
<BR>&gt; that are nice and play the way you want em (if so I'm outta here
<BR>&gt; hate such stuff).. People should be allowed to do what they
<BR>&gt; please, and of course laws are there made by game (game
<BR>&gt; mechanics) and social laws that exist can be talked about and
<BR>&gt; consulted to players when needed by GMs...even these can be
<BR>&gt; easily fixed by ignoring the person, or even better on PVP
<BR>&gt; server..by killing them...
<P>&gt; now for that frowning upon killing out of rule...sigh.. Roleplay
<BR>&gt; means roleplay as someone else..(or yourself for that matter) so
<BR>&gt; why can't I roleplay a character that is mute? yes MUTE... or he
<BR>&gt; doesn't want to have his voice heard while he murders people so
<BR>&gt; just incase some1 escapes, they can't identify them later
<BR>&gt; (fictional explanation....one of MANY)..so I'm saying..PKilling
<BR>&gt; should not frown on such killings. . "Hi.." (kills the
<BR>&gt; guy) "Hahhaha"... this just enriches the game by
<BR>&gt; making it more agressive ..adds revenge..and challenge to it..
<P>&gt; Newbie killing I agree on, but again don't punish people for
<BR>&gt; doing it..I think PVP server will be mainly user run
<BR>&gt; community...as in strongest guilds are the law actually so I
<BR>&gt; think people wil actually take care of newbie killing... I
<BR>&gt; myself would kick some1s as whos annoying non stop...
<P>&gt; Again on "out of character killing" I am not too sure
<BR>&gt; what you mean by this, but again this shouldn't be punished at
<BR>&gt; all.
<P>&gt; -Tarquin...just fighing versus GM favourtism and rule (sorry
<BR>&gt; maybe I'm annoying, ..blame it on UO GM's...they got this thing
<BR>&gt; into me...tons of favouritism and unfair and unequal player-gm
<BR>&gt; relationships..)
