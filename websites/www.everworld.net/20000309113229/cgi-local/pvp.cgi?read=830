<P>

<BR>The EQ economy is far too harsh and unforgiving to permit a player to lose all his equipment. Judging from these and other comments you made I strongly suspect you have not played EQ yet. Equipment in EQ is horribly expensive and can take a week or more of adventuring to pay for just a single quality item. If players on a PvP server, who will die on a regular and frequent basis, can be camped so they lose all their items... suffice it to say those players are not going to stick with PvP very long at all. The large PvP guilds will already have an advantage on the server, there is no reason to permit corpse camping as a tactic to destroy other players (or force them to all play monks and mages).
<P>Allowing items to be returned to the player upon PvP death is a bit of a bonus to the PvP player, but I think it is justified as the PvP player is dying much more often and they are losing an item every time they do. PvE players rarely run the risk of losing their items to an unrecoverable situation. Keep in mind that a single piece of real armor or a good weapon represents a week's worth of time invested into the game. At very low levels it's not much of an issue as sewn patchwork cloth can be replaced in a day or two of play, but much higher than that and it becomes a nightmare that has driven many players to the bring of frustration and quitting (just to lose 1 set of equipment).
<P>&gt; NEVER gonna happen....the game then has to differentiate between
<BR>&gt; death vs the enviornment and death vs a player ....one of the
<BR>&gt; main reasons dying is a pain in the ass are situations like when
<BR>&gt; your body is at the bottom of the well in befallen and it
<BR>&gt; becomes a mini-quest just to get your stuff back
<P>&gt; no help AT ALL on PvP server
<P>&gt; ...this can be construed as coddling someone who took a PvP risk
<BR>&gt; and came out on the bad end of it......dying should be an
<BR>&gt; ENORMOUSLY frustrating experience and in the present state of
<BR>&gt; EQ, it is......a risk is just that
<P>&gt; #1 solves the problem but creates a bigger one than it
<BR>&gt; solves........i, personally, think people are smart enough to
<BR>&gt; maybe keep an extra sword in the bank or something.......in a
<BR>&gt; PvP only world, there will be LOTS more equiptment type items
<BR>&gt; floating around amongst the players and we will prolly see alot
<BR>&gt; of UO begger syndrome and i think the economy can probably
<BR>&gt; support this..........i would be very careful about arguing for
<BR>&gt; things that make the repercussions of a PvP loss less
<BR>&gt; significant.....as it is now, nobody can realistically win a
<BR>&gt; very high percentage of PvP encounters (esp with the anonymous
<BR>&gt; switch)....the people who PvP more will die more and will lose
<BR>&gt; more equiptment.....the way around the guarding problem is to
<BR>&gt; make the envoiornment hostile enough towards PK'ers that they
<BR>&gt; won't want to hang out around the scene of the crime long
<BR>&gt; enough.............how bout this....person a kills person b,
<BR>&gt; person b respawns and person a decides to camp his
<BR>&gt; corpse......person b is stuck like chuck.....but what happens if
<BR>&gt; after the murder there is some length of time t (a function
<BR>&gt; perhaps of the level of the people involved and their proximity
<BR>&gt; to a guarded population center) in which a guard will come to
<BR>&gt; investigate the murder .....somone "called the cops"
<BR>&gt; so to speak......this encourages anyone responsible for murder
<BR>&gt; to beat a hasty retreat before the fuzz shows up
