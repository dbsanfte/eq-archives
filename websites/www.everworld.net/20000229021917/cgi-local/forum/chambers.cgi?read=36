<P>I believe that extending EQ's model of monster races would be one of the better ways to provide everquest with a fun twist, and could be a very natural extension to the game! Here's some of my thoughts. Anyone want to comment?

<P>Many of the monster races in EQ, such as Orcs, Kobolds, Lizardmen, Pixies, Undead, Aquagoblins etc. have a class structure and level hierachy similar to that of levels for the current player races.
<P>Some cool skills could be built into monster playing with level advancement, such as having NPC spawned monsters assist higher level monster players just as they do now with higher level NPC's. For this reason, the monster races which tend to assist each other would be better picks for playable races. If this were added, the current non-moving non-monster race NPC's should be changed to play like monster NPC's do now.
<P>When playing a monster, you should be able to loot a non-monster player's corpse just like PK. This would allow players to kill other players with the fun of PK mode in a more natural way
<P>Playing monster races would help clean up alignment issues related to good/evil. Monsters can be played as "good" monsters or "evil" ones (within the monster player races), but they should never be allowed to group with parties of normal race PC's. I think this is a current flaw in Everquest's alignment model because races that hate each other based on faction standing (such as Dark Elves vs. High Elves) should not be allowed to group together to accomplish a common goal--they would rather kill each other instead.
<BR>The current races of Dark Elf, Troll and Ogre would cleanly transition to Monster classes.
<P>Starting cities are another issue with the current layout of the continents, and I don't think monster starting cities should be accessable from any non-dungeon zone. Starting cities for monsters should probably be placed in zones that are not adjacent to normal PC cities, or new zones that are extended off of existing dungeons. Having dungeons provide a layer between monster starting cities and normal starting cities would be a natural extension point, because they form the primary areas for conflict between monster and normal players. For example, Crushbone would probably not be a good starting city for orc PC's because it is too close to the city of Kelethin, but by adding a zone entrance near the leg tents to a new monster zone with an aquagoblin port with orc ships over to an evil Antonica zone would get around the current "flat world" feeling. In this way, Verant could open up new avenues of transport between continents for monsters to travel more safely accross Norrath.
<P>By not allowing players to play monsters, games such as EQ and UO get forced into dealing with the problems inherent with PK'ing. For example, isn't it ridiculous that by turning in a piece of paper out of a book to a priest of Discord, you are now allowed to kill other players that decided to do the same thing (Although, I have to admit that it *does* help cut down on some of the negative aspects of PK'ing). By adding monster classes, you no longer have this issue. Just don't allow non-monster classes to kill non-monster classes, and don't allow monster classes to kill monster classes. Then, if players get "PK'ed", it becomes a more acceptable form of combat, and is "just another part of life in Norrath".
