<P>I'm of the opposite opinion on this...

<P>The penalties for being pk'ed are not harsh enough. I want a challenge, and real risk. This is the reason for my playing in a pk environment, excitement.
<P>UO was a complete bore, how can you gloat over someone's corpse knowing that you have done so little?
<P>This is what I would want from a +pvp server -
<P>- you can pk anybody
<BR>- you can loot anything
<BR>- if you die 3 times within a 7 day (realtime) period, you lose your character.
<P>Let's see Darwin's theory in action. The problem with UO was that anybody could be a great pk'er if they were willing to play 'round the clock and had friends of a like mind. Death was never a deterrent. I want to see real heros and villains, people that have beat the odds to gain the higher levels, not just players that traipse around the countryside without a care in the world. Enough of the mindnumbing drudgery, I want a game of skill, cunning and nerves.
<P>&gt; A lot of people will have a hard time losing 1 bubble of exp
<BR>&gt; from dying. And also the one item loot is major, many people may
<BR>&gt; think that 1 item is not enough but once they play it they will
<BR>&gt; realize that 1 item loss is GIANT and they wont want all items.
<BR>&gt; Unless you have a friend of pvp+ people you will have a hard
<BR>&gt; time grouping because no one will be able to heal/buff you and
<BR>&gt; you cant
