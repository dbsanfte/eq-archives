<P>My brothers, I find it disturbing how so many of our kind limit ourselves to that which we have been told we are allowed. Are we not the Teir'dal, the Master Race, destined to rule Norrath? We are superior to all, and all should bow to us in good time, yet we insist on crippling our abilities to secure a favorable position for our race! The Teir'dal should use all tools at our disposal to reach our goals, we should let cunning and shrewdness be our guides, deal in treachery and manipulation when it suits, entwining ourselves throughout the world with deceptive majesty. We should not shun the lesser races completely, for they can be of use to us, and only a fool throws away a useful tool out of hand. Innoruuk is the Prince of Hate, the one who took the first Elven royalty, and fashioned us from them. He purged many weaknesses from our beings, but he left one. The simple fact is that Hatred is as great a weakness as unbrindled Love and Kindness. Simple self-interest and hunger for power should drive us, without thought for petty emotion. However, I do not say that we should not use Hate, for it is a powerful force. I say merely that we should not let it take root within ourselves! Let us use the Hate the lesser races feel for us, let us turn it back upon them until they choke on it, showing them their grand hypocrisy. If we deal with them cunningly, appearing peaceful, and they maintain their fashion of slaying us, then we can manipulate the bleeding hearts of their kind into believing they do us wrong, send their simple minds into a unrecoverable spin as we play tactfully with their moral structure. We shall not gain our proper place in the world with blind Hatred and violence, for we have not the sheer numbers to dominate in such a fashion. Through the use of clever diplomacy, we can, rather than taking the world by force, make that world WANT us to rule it. We are the Teir'dal, and we have Ages to achieve victory, we can orchestrate schemes that span generations of the lesser races, for we have all the time in the world.

<P>Some who know me may wonder how a Necromancer can say such things about Hate, about Innoruuk. I will say this, Innoruuk is naught but a means to an end, another tool for the use of our race. If I can be said to worship any god, it would be he, for he 'Fathered' our race, but I do not follow him because I believe in his ways, I follow him because I had to declare loyalty to him, even if it was not felt in my heart, to gain the teachings I sought, those of the Dark Arts. We should be thankful to Innoruuk for creating us, and give him the honor of being one of the Teir'dal's primary tools, but we have grown far beyond him, we are superior to him, and we must follow the path that leads to surest victory.
<BR>Those of you who are willing to do what is best for our race, despite what the mindless Priests and blind God wish, contact me, and we will begin the Teir'dal's true rise to power.
