<P>> WOW 6 WHOLE ZONES?!?!?!!? good lord we hit the jack pot!!! thank

<BR>&gt; you so much you total idiot!Sorry to flame but this guy is a
<BR>&gt; total moron. do you really think 6 zones or even 10 zones will
<BR>&gt; last in long term? hell no! so sprout a brain and post possible
<BR>&gt; answers not just yur wrong.
<P>&gt; Pissed off
<P>It IS a shame when someone responds to a post with name calling and shows that all sorts of people play this game. Even the less mature ones.
<P>With this in mind, I would remind you that folks reading this and posting here may actually be REAL people in the world. NOT Junior High students like yourself. IE They may have important jobs like writing articles for magazines or perhaps investigating crimes (which happens to be my profession). Certainly the people here could be someone you surely would not call an IDIOT to their face simply because they explained that the Troll and Ogre zones are really GOOD areas. I am at a loss to understand why you took such offense to a simple educated opinion regarding you initial post.
<P>I posted that information because I have been playing this game from through P3 and actually have some experience with not only those zones, but also many others. I have read my earlier post and failed to find anything there that insulted or made fun of you in any way.
<P>With all this in mind, I still am appalled at your response. Do you think you would actually have the courage to call me an IDIOT to my face based upon the information you have received from this board? Or, as I am coming to learn based on your post, are you simply hiding behind the obscurity of the internet in the false knowledge that no one will know who you are.
<P>If you plan on using this ISP and/or this name for any length of time you might want to consider your posts in the future as all you will do is make folks like me dislike you. (To late for me I surely dislike you now). Respond all you like and post all you like in the future, but know this: I will not read any of your other posts as your opinion has been proven to me to be unworthy of my attention.
