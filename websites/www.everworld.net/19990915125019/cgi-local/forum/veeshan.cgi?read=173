<P>"A Corpse Without a Souls?", Written by Lochedahnan [LOA]

<P><font face="verdana, arial" size="2"><blockquote>Why must I be disturbed. Why can I not rest again. Must I keep awake. So tired. must sleep again, but nay, I cannot. Must keep awake. Must stand and wait.<p>A living creature! At a full run I close on the orc with my hair and tattered dress training behind me in the breeze. I observe the orc warrior's face twist in horror at my approach. He begins to flee but realizes that escape is not feasible, my speed is almost inhuman. I try to resist hitting him with my hand, but I cannot. He crouches in a defensive position with halberd drawn. Now a mixture of anticipation and horror comes over me as my hand crashes into his shield, shattering it as well as flaying the flesh off my knuckles. But alas, no pain. I shattered the shield! How can I be that strong? Now, obviously in shock at my blow, he retaliates and thrusts the tip of his weapon though my abdomen. Again, no pain. Why? I should know why this is but I can not remember the last few days. I remember when as a child I once cried at the sight of a sewing needle stuck in my thumb... "Mommy, it hurts!" "Shhh darling, I will make it all better", as she removed the tip of the needle from my small delicate thumb. "How's my daughter now?" she asks in a reassuring tone. "Fine now mama." "Good, be abit more careful next time" "I will mama, I love you." "I love you too", I remember mother saying back to me. <p> BLAM! Lost in my thoughts, I don't remember hitting the orc in the shoulder. I obviously dislocating it with the impact. I watch in horror as he stumbles backwards in pain, cradling his useless arm. The horrid cries!!!, the horrible cries of fear and desperation he yells as he falls backward on a stump. BLAM! I again crush him in the face with my left hand, breaking his jaw as well as my wrist. I can't help but stare in sheer terror as his mouth lies open and useless on his neck, blood gurgling from the back of his throat hole behind his torn tongue. "Hahahah... Taunting Attacker Master", I hear myself say in a hoarse but feminine voice. He tries to swing at me from his back, but in vain. I then jump on his chest with amazing speed tearing my once white ornate burial dress. I try to resist as I thrust my gruesome hand deep into his chest cavity and strangle his beating heart. I feel his life ebb away as the beats strain and slows their repetitions. As I stare at his blood covered face, I hear him whimper the names of what I believe to be his wife's name in his native language. <p> His heart stops. His hand clenched around my neck falls to the ground as the last breathe escapes from his lungs. I catch a reflection of myself in his glassed over eyes. MY FACE! What has happened to my face! So beautiful I was, now.... now.... I try to weep, but no tears fall. <p>From the shadow of an elm a figure steps forth, draped in black robes carrying a intricate staff. Slowly he walks closer, yet... I do not charge him. There is no rage as before, just a blind reverence and allegiance to him. He pulls back his runed hood to reveal a bluish skinned, clean cut man with crisp chiseled features with finely groomed long white hair. He gently kneels down next to where I am and sifts through the orc's belongs, careful not to stain his garb with blood. With a wave of his hand, my broken bones begin to mend themselves, but my ripped flesh does not. "Excellent... Follow me.", he orders quietly. "Following master.", I acknowledge with the same hoarse but barely feminine voice. I stand up slowly withdrawing my rotting hand from the corpse's chest cavity.<p>I follow him not knowing why. I can not help myself but to obey. I'm so tired. I need to rest. Must return to my sleep. Mother... where are you?... please help me..........<p> "Follow me, follow me."<hr><b>Note:</b> Written by Lochedahnan, Drow Necromancer, <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/" target="_top">Lost Order of Akalabeth</a></blockquote></font>
