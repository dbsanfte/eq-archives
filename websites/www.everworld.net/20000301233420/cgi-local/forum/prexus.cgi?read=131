<P>> Flipped out?

<P>Ok fin you didn't flip out. But you were a lot more hostile then you needed to be.
<P>&gt; Oh please, I simply wondered why you
<BR>&gt; insisted on making something simple so
<BR>&gt; complicated?
<P>That's just it, it was a lot more complicated then it seemed to you. Just about everyone posted something about it, before me. Even you, with your banshee wail thing, though that was after, lets not quible.
<P>&gt; I explained, that by no means
<BR>&gt; did I actually mean that in a command sort
<BR>&gt; of form.
<P>I must have missed that one. We are keeping the alley period sure seems like a command to me.
<P>&gt; As for my post not being
<BR>&gt; constructive, we DID keep the alley scene,
<BR>&gt; did we not?
<P>You got your way, yes, if that was all you wanted then I guess you were productive. That was not the base of my arguement though. I was willing to keep it, though I thought it would have been a lot easier if it was used the way it was intended, as nothing. I still don't understand how Rinnyl misunderstood that Bucho came back out onto the same road, and didn't go through the alley.
<P>&gt; Maybe the problem is I'm just
<BR>&gt; too simple a person for you to understand..
<P>I don't understand this one. I try not to make fun of you, I do understand you well enough not to do that.
<P>&gt; And no, I do not try to make you look bad,
<BR>&gt; you do enough of that on your own, darkelf.
<P>Gee thanks. Though from the input I have recieved, and I will by no means name their speakers, it is agreed that the only thing I really did wrong was actually continue. Which you might notice consisted of one post, though long, that was the last thing I said on the subject.
<P>&gt; and please, I do not make him look like a
<BR>&gt; god
<P>I did not say make him look like a god, and if I did, I didn't mean to. What I meant is that you treat him like one. I have watched and noticed something interesting, if I say something, it is crap, and you make sure I know it. If he says something it is sparkling gold, and if I have said anything that could be viewed as disagreeing with him, you make sure to state how right he is.
<P>&gt; but he is making sense
<P>Yes, he does make sense, that is why I respect what he says, and usually let him have his way if he really thinks something should be a certain way.
<P>&gt; and that seems
<BR>&gt; to be what your looking for, considering I
<BR>&gt; post nothing but gibberish and ramble on and
<BR>&gt; on like I am now..
<P>Actually this is exactly what I wanted. You don't seem to be letting your emotions make you irrational, or at least keep you from listening to what's being said. I'm not trying to put you down, i just can't think of any other way to say it. See that, can't, I admit I'm not perfect, but I still try to keep whats best for the story in the public eye. This story is very important to me. Not that it isn't important to you, I'm just saying, I do know what is going on, I sort of have to.
