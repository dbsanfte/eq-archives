<P>Well, in a previous life (character) I was a level 3 monk engaging in the mad hunt before the front gates of Freeport. Now I travel the plains of Karana hunting big game being the tracker for a group of 4. My advice to you is to simply open up your lungs and shout your intentions to group adventure. You'd be surprised how many responses you will recieve saying to meet at such and such a place. Most people though want to group with only those no more than 1 or 2 levels in difference and want to know your plans for hunting so have this prepared ahead of time. Honestly most seem to WANT to play solo until at least level 4 for the exp and seem to think this is the "best" way to do it. Well, with the exception of a begining bard with the song of dissonance (not sure about that spelling, been awhile...) which will draw everything within the viewing area sraight to you, grouping up, in my ever so humble opinion is the way to go! Advances seem to always come faster and at the end of the time together I KNOW I have loads more cash and items to sell than I ever could have staked out on my own in the same amount of time. Also when people get to know you and your group is successful, the same people tend to use "/" or some other command (/friend, etc.)and see if you are on right away after logging in! Many times I have entered the game not for 5 minutes and started selling last game's loot, contemplating a trip to Qeynos for some better gear, when a barrage of /tell calls come in asking if I'm ready to go! Anyway I know this did not help you personally but I hope it does encourage others to start working together more frequently and earlier (which is a BIG help to you spell-throwing types!). To prove my case that grouping is just plain more productive ask that well equipped warrior (I've started seeing alot of chainmail armor of late) or high level spell mage the secret to their success and 9 times out of ten their answer is going to start with "well, me and my group have been hitting..." and then finish with any region you don't dare travel alone. Well I've said more than my share. Good luck and Good hunting to all who made it this far!
