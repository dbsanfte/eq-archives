<P>> Many of you haven't had a chance to play the game, and with this

<BR>&gt; NDA, I am going to be as non-descriptive as possible.
<BR>&gt; Realmweaver, Have you actuallyplayed the game? If so, have you
<BR>&gt; adventured in a party?
<P>Unfortunately, I learned of EQ too late to participate in the Beta testing. So, no, I have not played the game. However, as my editorial states, I have roots in endless ages of MUDding - the same roots as I'm sure many EQ developers draw from.
<P>&gt; Well, in a party you tend to
<BR>&gt; take on certain responsibilities, and one of them is to protect
<BR>&gt; your party members as best as you can.
<P>Of course. The same holds true for all MUDs. The grouping system is designed to enhance teamwork, social interaction, as well as give people a chance to knock out some nasty mobs which they would otherwise be helpless against alone.
<P>&gt;Well, lets say
<BR>&gt; your PK-ing idea goes into effect and I am venturing with you.
<BR>&gt; We are running through whereever and a monster
<BR>&gt; jumps out of who know where and starts hitting you from behind.
<BR>&gt; You race to type to your fellow party member you
<BR>&gt; are being attacked and as you are I notice you are being hit for
<BR>&gt; a good deal of damage. I spin around, hit the key to
<BR>&gt; target that monster and hit the key to start attacking. Oops, my
<BR>&gt; target accidentally targeted you, and with no safety
<BR>&gt; measures I knock you down more hit points, maybe even killing
<BR>&gt; you (ya know mages just don't seem to have that
<BR>&gt; much health to them). I killed you, and I didn't mean to do it.
<P>Well, there are several possible solutions/responses to this situation. If the problem is that severe and it really is that difficult to accurately target creatures, then perhaps EQ would need to tweak its targeting system altogether. If it is that un-user-friendly then something is inherently wrong with the targeting system, not with the PK rules.
<P>If the targeting system is indeed effective, then the error lies in human hands. The same problem arises in MUDs all the time. You are sitting for awhile talking to your friend "Mog" and get so used to typing "tell Mog," "look Mog," "nod Mog," etc. then when you go crashing into battle a few minutes later, you type "kill Mog" instead of "kill dragon." I actually did kill Mog one day, and it was in the middle of a PK fight, no less. Needless to say I felt like a jackass, and he was rather irate - but it was my mistake, not an inherent flaw in the system. I was the one who let my guard down, I was the one who become unaware of my actions. If you cannot remain alert and pay attention to what you're doing, then you should practice a little before venturing with a party that puts their trust in you.
<P>The final solution - if the problem REALLY gets out of hand, is to add an option called "Befriend" or "Peace" - a toggle switch much like a "friend list" which specifies players who you CANNOT target, even if it seems like you are trying to in the heat of battle. This gives you a safety net if you aren't very good with the keybord or mouse - whichever it is you use to target.
