<P>FREEPORT (NPI) - Argil Silverlock, formerly of Felwithe and self-styled "Magician at Large", announced today the opening of a new Jewel Crafting establishment, the Argentium. "We saw a need for customers from all over Norrath to have a safe and trustworthy source for their jewelry", says Argil, "and we have addressed that need with the creation of the Argentium." The Argentium represents a co-operative effort between Argil Silverlock (Owner and Proprietor) and Yojo of Ak'Anon, Senior Partner and cousin to the famous "ojo" brothers of Kaladim [see story, "Much Ado About Dwarven Voodoo", page C4].

<P>The Argentium features a full line of made-to-order decorative rings, bracelets, and necklaces, as well as the ever-popular Engagement and Wedding rings, according to Silverlock.
<P>"We offer our customers their choice of payment plans", explained the lanky High Elf. "For those customers on a budget, we ask only that they furnish the gemstone desired and a bar of silver. If they are unable to acquire the silver, we will furnish one of ours for a charge of 7 gold. If an Enchanted silver bar is called for, the upcharge will be 1 platinum. Of course, the drawback of this approach is that the customer assumes all liability for failed attempts. Jewel Crafting is a very demanding skill. While our jewelers must pass the most rigorous of training regimens, there is always a chance of failure." When pressed further on this point, Silverlock only responded, "Past success is no guarantee of future results."
<P>"Realizing that many customers will be uncomforatable with this level of risk", Argil continued, "We have recently instituted a limited Price List for some of the more popular magical jewelry items. I must beg our customers' patience during these first few weeks, as it is quite probable that items will be frequently out of stock. We will do our utmost to hold to these prices, at least through this opening weekend. Supply difficulties may force us to raise our prices soon," he concluded with a convincingly wistful sigh.
<P>Silver Jade Ring - +5 Mana - 6 Platinum
<BR>Silver Pearl Ring - +4 vs Poison - 8 Platinum
<BR>Silver Topaz Necklace - +4 vs Disease - 9 Platinum
<P>"One last detail - I want to remind customers of our 'Two-Handed Specials', an Argentium exclusive," Argil said. "With the purchase of any Jade ring, a customer gets 1 platinum off the second. With the purchase of any Pearl or Topaz item, the customer may take 2 platinum off the second of equal or lesser value. This is our way of rewarding our valued customers for their continued patronage."
<P>Argil expects business to be in full swing very shortly. "There are many details to look after... zoning permits in Freeport, supply difficulties with our overseas gemstone merchants, hush money to Bagbok the Troll about that unfortunate incident with our competitors... um, you can just forget that last one, right?", he concluded nervously. "Here, I'm sure I have something that would look good on you..."
<P>This reporter wishes Argil the best of luck. I must say that his Amber rings are simply gorgeous. Just don't ask how I know.
