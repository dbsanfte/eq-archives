</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> Have it so that if anyone attacks anyone within your party you

<BR>&gt; are automatically given the right to attack them back, despite
<BR>&gt; level or race. Why would you not be able to defend your friend?
<BR>&gt; Just because your 5 levels above or below the person that
<BR>&gt; decided to attack your group.?. As it is exactly that, an attack
<BR>&gt; upon the group not a single person and it should be treated as
<BR>&gt; so.
<P>that sounds good to me.
<P>&gt; I still think that having level limits on a PvP server is a bad
<BR>&gt; idea, and hope that there is a good way around it. I have an
<BR>&gt; idea... Why not make it so that anyone attacking someone below
<BR>&gt; their level takes a much larger noteriety hit than if they were
<BR>&gt; to attack someone equal or above their level. Perhaps even
<BR>&gt; rewarding with a larger noteriety increase those that kill
<BR>&gt; people higher than their level. I think that instead of having a
<BR>&gt; level limit the noteriety system should be the way to control
<BR>&gt; the pkilling, make it so that people are rewarded for killing
<BR>&gt; people that are nearer to their level and are enemies to their
<BR>&gt; race and punished for killing people lower than their level and
<BR>&gt; friendly to their race. For example, a human warrior level 20
<BR>&gt; comes across a troll shadow knight level 15. Since humans hate
<BR>&gt; trolls it would be common sense for the human to attack the
<BR>&gt; troll. If the level limit was inplace this would not be possible
<BR>&gt; and would hinder the actual role playing element of the game.
<BR>&gt; Now if the human was to attack the troll and kill him his
<BR>&gt; faction standing with trolls should decrease at a MUCH larger
<BR>&gt; margin than if the troll sk was level 20. And the increase he
<BR>&gt; receives towards humans would increase far less than if the
<BR>&gt; troll sk was 20. If the troll was to win his standing with
<BR>&gt; trolls would increase at a MUCH larger margin than if he was
<BR>&gt; level 20, and his standing with humans should decrease at a much
<BR>&gt; lower margin than if he was level 20. This leads me to my second
<BR>&gt; point. Since the killing in this game is going to be mostly good
<BR>&gt; vs. evil then I think a good\evil faction standing needs to be
<BR>&gt; implemented and this faction standing will be modified based on
<BR>&gt; who\what you kill. The way NPC's will treat you should also be
<BR>&gt; based on this faction standing. For example I have noticed that
<BR>&gt; there is a new tunnel system in freeport. If this good\evil
<BR>&gt; faction standing was implemented it would be common place to
<BR>&gt; find evil people traveling through the tunnels making it much
<BR>&gt; more difficult for the evil people to travel around without
<BR>&gt; risking their lives, as going above ground into town where the
<BR>&gt; "good" people roam would almost ensure death by
<BR>&gt; guards. If this idea was put inplace whole new societies of good
<BR>&gt; and evil people would form adding a huge element to the RPG
<BR>&gt; environment. It would also make for having race specific
<BR>&gt; notorious people, trolls might want the head from someone that
<BR>&gt; humans look upon as a hero. Implementing a new /con system for
<BR>&gt; pvp wouldnt be a bad idea either. Or perhaps adding a few lines
<BR>&gt; to the current /con which states something about what would
<BR>&gt; happen to your noteriety if you attacked such person, or stated
<BR>&gt; the persons noteriety with their race and with yours.
<P>I don't like thinking about UO but let's flashback to it for a second, Order and Chaos guards, are set up so people with the opposing shield are highlighted in enemy guild color, people with same shield are highlighted with friendly guild color, there's even a nice storyline behind it, but it is only used by the DeWdZ and they will fight with people with either shield, just because they can. They could care less wether some of these people were supposed to be their allies, they did it because they could. I'm not saying that what you're talking about would be just like that, but a lot of people would just not care unless there were BIG penalties involved with losing standing with your faction.
