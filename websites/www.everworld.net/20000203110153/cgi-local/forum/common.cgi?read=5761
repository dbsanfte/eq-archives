To the casual observer, she would have been a blur through the trees.. moving at astonishing speed. The truth of it was, however, her steps were perfectly calculated and timed with her heartbeat and the terrain around her.. and she was in nothing more than a brisk walk... but faster than most could run. <p>She had been tracking her prey for what had seemed like an eternity.. waiting for the right chance to strike. Circling.. staying downwind.. always out of sight. <p> The orc ran.. as fast as an orc could run. His message clenched white knuckled in his fist... his stout legs pumping, breaking sticks, kicking up rocks, and basically making a serious racket. The ranger wondered how he had not attracted the attention of a larger predator by now.. doing her work for her. <p> Unfortunately it looked like she would have to get her hands dirty. The orc stumbled into a clearing, and clumsily made his way for the cover of the brush on the other side. This was her opportunity, and she struck. <p> When the orc was a few feet from the brush, she was behind him, moving at an angle and spinning.. her thulian claws dropped into her hand and she slashed... slicing into his ribs. The orc howled and spun, clenching his side with one hand and bringing his sword to bear with the other. The ranger landed on her feet, and her other hand found her whip.. with lightning speed the end of the whip arced through the air, and with a loud crack, the barbed tip found the orc's left eye.. causing it to explode into a crimson cloud of pain. <p> Now the orc was mad... REALLY mad.. and he charged in a berserker rage.. a bit faster than she had anticipated... and caught her leg square with his sword. The blade bit deeply.. and she winced in pain as she spun on her good leg to come around behind the orc. Half blind and exhausted.. the orc was far too slow to react, and she drove her claws straight and true through the base of the orc's neck.<p> With a twitch and a whimper.. the orc fell, and the fight was over. <p>She fell to her knees beside the orc.. grabbed the note that was now covered in blood from the beast's side wound.. searched his pouches for any other valuables.. and limped to the cover of the forest to bind her wounds. <p> As she rested her leg.. she tried to read the message, and it appeared it was as she had feared. Though a good portion of the message had been destroyed by the fight.. it looked as if Gradishar was right to send her to intercept this missive. <p> She took note of all the names mentioned.. Waran.. Azlana.. Xirius.. Argil.. and other friends. Why would the Deathfist clan have such interest in The Lost Order? There was too much information missing in the note.. the bits and pieces she was able to read left to cryptic a message.. and too much room for the imagination to fill in the gaps. She feared the worst.. and she knew she had to alert her mates immediately.<p>She leaned over to tighten her bandage... and prepare herself for her journey back to Freeport.. and whisper a small prayer that her greatest fears would truly turn out to be an over active imagination. <p>Then she was off like the wind.<p>.. to be continued.</blockquote><hr><font face="Verdana" size="2"><center><a href="http://www.lostorder.com" target="_top" border="0"><img src="http://gamecore.net/loa-ads/loa_steel_icon.gif" border="0"><div>www.lostorder.com</a></center></font>
