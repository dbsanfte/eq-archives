</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>Well, You know, I play a de. and there are a few pks that roam around, course, they are relatively low level. And are best just ignored until you pass them, then kill them if you want, but truley I doubt they care. I dont think it is out of control, nor do I feel it is anywhere as bad as it is made out to be. Most people just act it out wrong, but most pks are just killings of other races, and they figure that is close enough. Just kos everyone who is not your race and you arent technically doing much wrong.

<BR>I have been pkd a total of maybe 8 times. most of which may have even had the quasi-roleplay reason. Either way, when you return, return with a large group, and the baddies usualy have fled. You people are so dead set on tryign to stop them. Caos happens, you lose xp, it happens. Just keep playing and stop crying. I mean really, you dont want to get pkd, then go to another server. You knew what you were getting into when you joined this server.
<BR>I have worked hard for my levels, and was frustrated when I was killed, but I go elsewhere and continue to grow, letting them stay and pk. If they pk, you pass them. It is that simple. pk is not productive. If someone is killing you over and over, call a friend, make a friend. most people will help. Even evil people will come if there is someone doing something that is totally lame. If for no other reason that just to kill someone that thinks they are bad.
<BR>Im a wizard, my spells are weak still, my root never holds. But I keep working. I guess just stop crying and keep working at it. You'll leave the petty pks behind and grow powerful.
