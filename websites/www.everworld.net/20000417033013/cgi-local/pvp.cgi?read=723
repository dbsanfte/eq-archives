</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>Well that was quite long. Anyway there was a lot of information in this so i will try to go step by step.......

<P>&gt; when Verant sat down and made this game in the first place, they
<BR>&gt; wanted to make a very ROLEPLAYING oriented game.......i'm not
<BR>&gt; saying this is good or bad, it's just the way it is....they set
<BR>&gt; out to build a online COMMUNITY....these are guys who seem to
<BR>&gt; have played endless MUD's and have made EQ very much like the
<BR>&gt; MUD's they have played......MUD's are also about community......
<P>I aggree completely.
<P>&gt; now the problem with this in regardes to PvP is that PvP is not
<BR>&gt; a community (at least not as defined by the sensiblities of the
<BR>&gt; rest of the world)......to "normal" players, you guys
<BR>&gt; appear to be people who want to destroy any sense of community
<BR>&gt; they may exist and the sad truth is, the guys who made the game
<BR>&gt; are the "normal" players.......
<P>I believe PvP CAN and SHOULD be part of the community.....PvP does not neccasarilly (that was pathetic....) mean k3wLd0od. It should in my opinion be used to facilitate the role-playing experience. This entire forum was (at least i thought) supposed to be used to discuss PvPing. Recently we have fallen into the topic of what would make the best use of PvP for US and still be enjoyable for them (non PvP).
<P>&gt; to "normal" players, UO was a game that was overrun by
<BR>&gt; k3wLd00d l33t Hax0R69 types and sucked miserably....i understand
<BR>&gt; that you guys enjoyed it, fair enough.......now, not to be
<BR>&gt; speaking on behalf of the dev team, but it sure as shit seems to
<BR>&gt; me that most of the rules set forth in EQ thus far have been
<BR>&gt; solely to control the k3wLd00d l33t Hax0R69's out there and not
<BR>&gt; allow them to ruin anyone else's game, which is what you did in
<BR>&gt; UO.....u took UO and made it fun for yourselves at the expense
<BR>&gt; of everyone who wasn't one of you...OSI tried to stop you for
<BR>&gt; some time, but since you were so l33t (hahaha) you found ways to
<BR>&gt; exploit the system, you found work-arounds to any anti-PK
<BR>&gt; mechanism that was implemented and continued to ruin the game
<BR>&gt; for the "normal" player....you basically took what was
<BR>&gt; supposed to be a roleplaying game and turned it into a stupid
<BR>&gt; frag-fest action game.....OSI was too dumb to stop you and was
<BR>&gt; eventually forced to play ball your way (because you were the
<BR>&gt; only paying customers left after having driven away all the
<BR>&gt; "normal" players)....
<P>This disapoints me....I admit several of the people who have been posting recently are the so-called "UO-REJECTS" but not all of us are.....a lot of us are people who tryed to use PKing to add realism to the game. We DID NOT merely go around killing people and gangbanging any newbies stupid enough to walk into us. Many players however did.
<P>&gt; to you guys UO was about how BAD you could be....it was a huge
<BR>&gt; pissing contest to see who could slaughter the most newbies, and
<BR>&gt; who could behave in the most antisocial way possible...this is
<BR>&gt; what you liked about the game...the way to "win" in UO
<BR>&gt; seems to have been to be more famous for being a prick than the
<BR>&gt; next guy (that's all i've heard anyone say on this board for the
<BR>&gt; last couple of days)....i don't pretend to understand it, but i
<BR>&gt; guess i have to respect it.........my problem with what you did
<BR>&gt; to UO was when people called you out for being snot-nosed, jr
<BR>&gt; high kids and you chose (for the most part) to defend your style
<BR>&gt; of gameplay by asserting how "in-character" and
<BR>&gt; "roleplaying" slaughtering hoardes of innocents was
<BR>&gt; because you were "roleplaying" an evil
<BR>&gt; character.......sigh.......you all know as well as i do that the
<BR>&gt; notion of a world populated entirely by serial killers is the
<BR>&gt; most unrealistic thing there is.....again, OSI's fault for not
<BR>&gt; making their world real enough....you see, kiddies, in the real
<BR>&gt; world when bad people do bad things, they are PUNISHED...and,
<BR>&gt; typically, the punishment reflects the seriousness of the
<BR>&gt; crime....murder being one of the more serious offences, any
<BR>&gt; logically thinking human being would conclude that the
<BR>&gt; punishment for murder would be pretty damn stiff...it
<BR>&gt; wasn't...in fact, it wasn't punished to any legitimate degree at
<BR>&gt; all and in the popular culture on UO servers, it was encouraged
<BR>&gt; and admired....EQ knows better
<P>First of I am 15. I played AD&D and MUDS before I eventually played UO and many other graphical MUDS (Diablo,Lineage, Baldur's Gate, and Drakkan to name a few) just because I am not old enough to drive doesn't mean that I am a KiLlAh00d69....
<BR>and pretending everyone on this board is, is just well incorrect. Many of the people here are adults.
<P>&gt; EQ has not made the same errors in game design that made your
<BR>&gt; vision of "serial killer land" possible....you will
<BR>&gt; have to live with this...waht made UO fun for you was , in fact,
<BR>&gt; just a clinic in poor design.....Verant has taken the time to
<BR>&gt; make, IMHO, a pretty damned realistic world in which your
<BR>&gt; actions , both dastardly and saintly, seem to have some very
<BR>&gt; real affect on your ability to play the game....this is
<BR>&gt; GOOD...good in the sense that peopel in Norrath will be forced
<BR>&gt; to behave within certain guidelines just like people in teh real
<BR>&gt; world are forced to behave within certain guidelines.......now
<BR>&gt; you'll all say "...but i don't want no r00ls, that shIt is
<BR>&gt; for FaGs....i WaNnA d0 wHAt i WanT....If I WanT to r0l3Play a
<BR>&gt; eViLL(tm) cHar, Th3N i ShouLd b3 abL3 to".....the truth is,
<BR>&gt; you want to play quake, and you want to force everyone to play
<BR>&gt; quake with you.......killing anyone who happens to walk by is
<BR>&gt; NOT roleplaying....roleplaying is behaving the way you believe
<BR>&gt; your character would behave in some fantasy setting......in any
<BR>&gt; reasonable society people are punished for killing
<BR>&gt; innocents....you char would know this before he started killin
<BR>&gt; innocents and wouldn't do it...if he did, he would be punished
<BR>&gt; severly (prolly killed, which would make your in-game experince
<BR>&gt; a little different, eh?)....
<P>I play Quake and I play Everquest. I try not to get the 2 confused.....it is not too hard considering one has guns and one doesn't.
<P>&gt; so NOW, you jokers are placed into a situation where you will be
<BR>&gt; forced to roleplay, where the world will fight back(just like
<BR>&gt; the real world) against it's criminal element and you're all
<BR>&gt; crying the blues about it....well cry me a river, monkey boy,
<BR>&gt; cause that's the way it is.....maybe this PvP server is a good
<BR>&gt; idea after all, it's actually a brilliant move on Verant's
<BR>&gt; part...they can quarantine al you assholes and isolate you from
<BR>&gt; people who want to actually play Everquest as opposed to
<BR>&gt; EverQuake......for the cost of another server and whatever
<BR>&gt; they're paying geiger, they can maintain their initial
<BR>&gt; game-design vision without the likes of you ruining it for
<BR>&gt; everyone else nd turn it into something it's not supposed to
<BR>&gt; be.....
<P>All the better. Just don't expect a "hard-core serial KiLlA" like me to cry.
<P>&gt; so, in a sense, you win.....you get your "serial killer
<BR>&gt; world"....have at it, jerk off.....but for god's sake if i
<BR>&gt; see one more post on this board demanding that Verant re-write
<BR>&gt; all their code to amke the game more fun for you guys, i'll go
<BR>&gt; mad.........in this case, my friends, you guys are the
<BR>&gt; minority...the game wasn't designed with you in mind and won't
<BR>&gt; be re-written to accomodate you...you're lucky enough that you
<BR>&gt; have your own server
<P>No one is demanding anything.....these are merely discussions about how to better control KiLlAd00dz and let the people who truly DO want to role-play AND PK, do both. None of us much suspects to get our wishes implemented any time soon.
<P>&gt; in the end, i believe PvP is doomed........Verant will NOT
<BR>&gt; re-write huge chunks of code (basically, what you seem to be
<BR>&gt; asking is for them to throw their whole level/skills out the
<BR>&gt; window and re-do it just for you) to accomodate you (whom
<BR>&gt; "normal" players consider to be a very annoying
<BR>&gt; degnerate case)......you d00ds are typical regarded as a probelm
<BR>&gt; that a game must be designed around....the bottom line is that
<BR>&gt; Verant, in all likeliehood, will honor NONE of your requsts and
<BR>&gt; you'll be playing the game, in respect to PvP, just as it is now
<BR>&gt; for a good long time .......there just simply isn't enough time
<BR>&gt; to develop two games concurrently and you'll be the ones that
<BR>&gt; are sacrificed for the good of the other........once the light
<BR>&gt; of day fianlly filters thru your thick skulls and you REALIZE
<BR>&gt; that PvP was put into ths game as an afterthought and this
<BR>&gt; REALLY isn't meant to be a PvP game, you'll get bored
<BR>&gt; (hopefully) and go back to UO or wherever it is you came from
<BR>&gt; and probably talk shit about what a horrible game this was for
<BR>&gt; years to come (..much like the way us "normal" players
<BR>&gt; still talk shit abou how bad UO sucked to this
<BR>&gt; day).........maybe i'm wrong, maybe Verant will spawn a daughter
<BR>&gt; company (VerantPvP inc) to re-write the entire game so that the
<BR>&gt; degenarate case 10% of the market will also buy it along with
<BR>&gt; the "normal" players........but i wouldn't hold my
<BR>&gt; breath ;)
<P>We aren't asking Verant to re-write anything. We WOULD like some new features added (arenas, bounty hunter guilds, and carvans) but we will still play regardless. So far most of the discussion has been ways to spice our experience. As far as PvP being an afterthought....well I am surprised you are so stupid as to believe that Verant wouldn't try to cater to both types of players. In fact I believe the PvP switch is a great solution. Also much of the discussion has been on ways to meld the two communities of players into one.
<P>&gt; ps ...the sad truth is that i initially cam onto this board as
<BR>&gt; an advocate of PvP....i didn't believe that the k3wL d00d
<BR>&gt; HaXoR69's really were so prevalent in the PvP
<BR>&gt; "community".......i was really hoping i'd find some
<BR>&gt; mature, intelligent people who could understand the diffence
<BR>&gt; between in-character PvP and EverQuake.......i have obviously
<BR>&gt; been shown the error of my ways and now humbly go back to join
<BR>&gt; the "normal" players.......as much as i liked the idea
<BR>&gt; of more developed PvP, i find that i must sacrifice that to keep
<BR>&gt; all the k3wL d00d HaXoR69's away from me so i can just play the
<BR>&gt; damn game MY way and not be forced to adapt my style to your
<BR>&gt; style (...and in so doing, givivng up many of the things i find
<BR>&gt; fun about the game just to survive).....enjoy your server and
<BR>&gt; have a nice day ;)
<P>I do understand what you mean and if you just CAN'T stand this board (and have nothing intelligent to offer besides lamentations on UO) then well why the hell should I care? As far as being mature....well I am not the one crying like a baby over all the k3wL d00dz, instead I am trying to find a way to EVOLVE PvP into a more......intelligent aspect of EQ and increase the realism and danger as well as the FUN of EQ. And Apparantly you did not read many of the posts because many of us are trying to create a "....more devoloped PvP...." (to use your words).
<P>P.S. As far as "normal" players go.....I hated UO too.
<P>Have A Nice Day : )

<TD COLSPAN=2><P><STRONG><font face=arial size=2>Message:</STRONG>
<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=70 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; Well that was quite long. Anyway there was a lot of information 
&gt; in this so i will try to go step by step....... 

&gt; I aggree completely. 

&gt; I believe PvP CAN and SHOULD be part of the community.....PvP 
&gt; does not neccasarilly (that was pathetic....) mean k3wLd0od. It 
&gt; should in my opinion be used to facilitate the role-playing 
&gt; experience. This entire forum was (at least i thought) supposed 
&gt; to be used to discuss PvPing. Recently we have fallen into the 
&gt; topic of what would make the best use of PvP for US and still be 
&gt; enjoyable for them (non PvP). 

&gt; This disapoints me....I admit several of the people who have 
&gt; been posting recently are the so-called &quot;UO-REJECTS&quot; 
&gt; but not all of us are.....a lot of us are people who tryed to 
&gt; use PKing to add realism to the game. We DID NOT merely go 
&gt; around killing people and gangbanging any newbies stupid enough 
&gt; to walk into us. Many players however did. 

&gt; First of I am 15. I played AD&D and MUDS before I eventually 
&gt; played UO and many other graphical MUDS (Diablo,Lineage, 
&gt; Baldur's Gate, and Drakkan to name a few) just because I am not 
&gt; old enough to drive doesn't mean that I am a KiLlAh00d69.... 
&gt; and pretending everyone on this board is, is just well 
&gt; incorrect. Many of the people here are adults. 

&gt; I play Quake and I play Everquest. I try not to get the 2 
&gt; confused.....it is not too hard considering one has guns and one 
&gt; doesn't. 

&gt; All the better. Just don't expect a &quot;hard-core serial 
&gt; KiLlA&quot; like me to cry. 

&gt; No one is demanding anything.....these are merely discussions 
&gt; about how to better control KiLlAd00dz and let the people who 
&gt; truly DO want to role-play AND PK, do both. None of us much 
&gt; suspects to get our wishes implemented any time soon. 

&gt; We aren't asking Verant to re-write anything. We WOULD like some 
&gt; new features added (arenas, bounty hunter guilds, and carvans) 
&gt; but we will still play regardless. So far most of the discussion 
&gt; has been ways to spice our experience. As far as PvP being an 
&gt; afterthought....well I am surprised you are so stupid as to 
&gt; believe that Verant wouldn't try to cater to both types of 
&gt; players. In fact I believe the PvP switch is a great solution. 
&gt; Also much of the discussion has been on ways to meld the two 
&gt; communities of players into one. 

&gt; I do understand what you mean and if you just CAN'T stand this 
&gt; board (and have nothing intelligent to offer besides 
&gt; lamentations on UO) then well why the hell should I care? As far 
&gt; as being mature....well I am not the one crying like a baby over 
&gt; all the k3wL d00dz, instead I am trying to find a way to EVOLVE 
&gt; PvP into a more......intelligent aspect of EQ and increase the 
&gt; realism and danger as well as the FUN of EQ. And Apparantly you 
&gt; did not read many of the posts because many of us are trying to 
&gt; create a &quot;....more devoloped PvP....&quot; (to use your 
&gt; words). 

&gt; P.S. As far as &quot;normal&quot; players go.....I hated UO too. 

&gt; Have A Nice Day : )
