<P>The other night while running through the East Commonlands a Human Monk named Gean ran by me and, admiring my Glowing Wooden Crook, asked if he could see the stats. I always try to be helpful to other players so I put it in a trade window. After Gean was done looking at it, he clicked cancel. My Inventory slots were all full and my crook fell on the ground. Before I could pick it up he grabs it runs, sits down, and camps. I asked him please dont do this, but he ignored my pleas and logged.

<P>In shock, I tried to think of something to do. Several minutes later Gean logged back in and ran to Freeport. When I noticed he was back online I sent a tell to him asking him to return my crook, to which he replied "I'll trade your crook back to you for your Brass breastplate." I thought about it for a minute, and though it angered me i agreed. I ran to Freeport to meet Gean.
<P>In the mean time I petitioned a GM. When I got to Freeport Gean told me to hold on he was calling someone. When he returned he informed me that it would cost me 50pp to get my crook back as a friend of his was offering him 42pp for it.
<P>All the time I was taking screenshots of him admitting his crime. When the GM responded to my petition she, Caelia(SP?) told me sorry that is a player problem you need to work it out. I persisted and eventually a senior GM, Willhelm, sent me a tell saying that they couldn't help me. In the mean time Gean informs me that he sol
<BR>d my crook to a player named Caspien for 42pp.
<P>Outraged, several of my friends accompanied me to Oasis to try and get another crook. While there who should show up but Gean, bragging about how he was so hated when he played Ultima Online. He got flamed for a while and eventually logged.
<P>Lockjaw never spawned for 7 hours of waiting and I am still without my favorite weapon, which was a gift from a friend who quit EQ.
<P>This is not meant as a whine, merely as a documentation of a wrong done to me by another player, and hopefully as a warning to others of the character of this player named Gean. Don't trust him.
