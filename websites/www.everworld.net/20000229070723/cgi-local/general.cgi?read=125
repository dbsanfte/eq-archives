</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>I have to afree with Kaiquan. In UO, you ended up with PK'ers that just wanted to go out and kill anyone they could, because they were hire level, and could do it with no threat. Making it harder for those without levels to actually accomplish much. Between trying to figure out if anyone was going to attack you as soon as you left the city and trying to watch for any monster you could kill, it was really tiresome. And that's why I did leave UO. It's been a while, so I ferget the name of the city, but there was one in the south that, every time you stepped just outside of the city limits, 15 - 20 people would immediatly begin attacking you with Bows and arrows and trying to wipe you out. And because they used the bows and arrows, you were toast at most distances. Didn't matter to them WHAT you had, so long as they got it. And even if not exiting the city, you got people that would come up while you were recouping from a monster fight, and would pick you off when you were weakened. Saw one specific group, that would look for ANY person who's rep was below the norm and kill them, if you attacked back, your rep went down more. With the PVP options available on Everquest, you chose from the start if you want that to happen or not. Even the factions you suggest would work, ONLY if you could MAKE everyone adhere to it. Why go out to kill another player? EQ's designed to help people work together, it's more interesting then. And, even then, with a chaotic party member, you can end up someplace you'd really rather not be.
