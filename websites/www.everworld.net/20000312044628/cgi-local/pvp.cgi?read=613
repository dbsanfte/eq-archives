<P>> ohh god last one this is entertaining me, you know that right :)

<BR>&gt; you are making my workday fun :P
<P>&gt; ok dokie to respond last 1 I swear....but u left yourself wide
<BR>&gt; open to be flamed on this one :P
<P>Nope you left yourself wide open to be flamed... man people on this board cant read or understand english obviously, or dont understadnt he way the english language works... Let me explain it to you.
<P>&gt; where in my post does it refer to real life in any way shape or
<BR>&gt; form..
<P>"my only point here was that you are a pompous inflated ego I think im god..."
<P>Are you trying to say that the above statement from you has no relation to real life. If you are you are stupid.
<P>&gt; you could be a really nice guy but this is a game
<BR>&gt; board...and you talk much shit about a game you never really
<BR>&gt; played except the bug filled beta that everyone Pked their asses
<BR>&gt; off in....I mearly took offence to you post below on the I was
<BR>&gt; GOD statement in UO when I who played beta also and (I dont
<BR>&gt; claim any fame whatsoever) know we Pked just as much as anyone
<BR>&gt; else.. including (bleh I guess you, but i still havent got but 1
<BR>&gt; beta person to even admit you existed) but for sure the so
<BR>&gt; called Great Hobbes.
<P>And of coarse you completely mis quoted my original post. I never said in my original post that I was god, Let me quote it for you.
<P>"To me this is the epidemy of role playing an evil god."
<P>You guys were the ones that started the talk about me saying I was a god. I only followed you in saying it.
<P>&gt; Bleh do you have a learning disorder like no reading
<BR>&gt; comprehension?
<P>Nope it seems here that you do, I have proven my point from quotes. Can you do the same? Nope. Because my quotes come from the original posts not from anything after, so anything you try and quote has no bearing.
<P>&gt; you dont understand the posts at all
<P>I understand them precisely, you were the one to mis interpret them.
<P>&gt; you could mearly have said ok mayby Im not exactly the UO god,
<BR>&gt; but i was good :P
<P>I didnt say I was a god I said I was role playing a god. I only said I was a god after you guys flamed me for saying I was role playing a god.
<P>&gt; dispite what you say here you were not the founding PKs in Beta
<BR>&gt; we all were beta Pks and pretty darn good ones at that,
<BR>&gt; I started the post becasue you cant in a game or real life go
<BR>&gt; around saying shit like that and not expect flat out laughter...
<P>Unfortunately your lack of reading comprehension caused you to misunderstand the post I made. Unfortunately for you you lose this argument.
