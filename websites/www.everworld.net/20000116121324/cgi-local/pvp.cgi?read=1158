<P>

<BR>In terms of game balance and PvP the hybrids are sort of a joke. SKs round out the bottom of the barrel. Paladins still seem to have their place, even in PvP, in the low to mid levels since they can do that wonderful heal 1x a day. Perhaps at higher levels Rangers with dual wield might come into their own, but the spellcasting abilities of the hybrids are a joke. They were a joke when they were first introduced into AD&D and they are a joke here. No one ever bothered to rectify the situation in AD&D becuase, lets face it, how many characters do you play in AD&D that are beyond 12th level?
<P>The Hybrids could be saved if they received spells that are equal in power to casters of the same level, or possibly cast at one or two levels lower. Reduce the selection of spells if needed to further balance it out, but for example a 20th Paladin should cast somewhere in the neighborhood of 18th for the spell to make sense. I don't expect so see any real changes to these hybrid classes in spite of the loud and frequent griping by those that favor them. Verant seems to think they have them nailed down, and perhaps they do for PvE. For PvP I think Paladins are good low-mid, and Rangers *may* be viable now with dual wield. SKs are right out, except perhaps at really low levels where that 10hp x level damage spell might come in handy :-)
<P>&gt; Thoughts on the SK
<P>&gt; You have less hp, ac, and attack power than a warrior in those
<BR>&gt; levels.. you can not duel wield, etc. It used to be that duel
<BR>&gt; wield was not that great and a 2h weapon was just as good, but
<BR>&gt; now duel wield is clearly superior. So Rangers and Warriors are
<BR>&gt; way better fighers at those levels.
<P>&gt; As far as spells.. healing and curative magic are easily the
<BR>&gt; most useful spells in the game. Paladins and Rangers get lots of
<BR>&gt; heals and cures and thus can keep going in a fight when a SK
<BR>&gt; would die and get back into the action after a fight must
<BR>&gt; quicker. I would also add that rangers and paladins get a couple
<BR>&gt; very nice buff spells.
<P>&gt; Shadow Knight spells may be "cool", but they are not
<BR>&gt; useful. I have played a lot since beginning of phase 3. I have
<BR>&gt; now played a necromancer through level 24 so I know every spell
<BR>&gt; a SK will every get, and although some of the spells are good..
<BR>&gt; heat blood for example. They wont do much at the level you get
<BR>&gt; them at. For example.. heat blood is about one of the best
<BR>&gt; spells a SK will ever get.. it does 160pts of damage over 10
<BR>&gt; rounds (16pts per round). I think the SK gets that at level 30..
<BR>&gt; by that level Paladins and Rangers can cure WAY WAY more HP than
<BR>&gt; 160 in 10 rounds.
<P>&gt; The one spell i can not comment on is how effective level 22 SK
<BR>&gt; (only level 8 necro), Vampric Embrace is... but I can say.. it
<BR>&gt; couldnt possibly do very much damage because a necro gets it at
<BR>&gt; level 8.. For comparison.. Wizards are the "best at
<BR>&gt; damage".. level 8 wizard spell Shock of Ice does 38pts and
<BR>&gt; does not heal the user. So you can bet Vampric Embrace will not
<BR>&gt; do more than 38pts.. At level 22.. any Tank character should be
<BR>&gt; able to dish more than 38pt with a melee weapon in a round
<BR>&gt; (remember.. double attack).. thus the SK is better off not
<BR>&gt; casting and just attacking.
<P>&gt; As far as the pets go.. The pets the SK gets will be usefull for
<BR>&gt; about 3 levels after the SK gets the pet. Then they will be far
<BR>&gt; too weak to even be worth summoning.
<P>&gt; I write this in hopes that everyone who reads it will do a
<BR>&gt; /feedback in the game to improve the SK. My main thoughts for
<BR>&gt; improvement would be .. replace the pet spells with the life
<BR>&gt; drain spells or increase the pet spells u recieve by one rank
<BR>&gt; (for example.. at level 15.. get level 12 instead of 8 pet.. at
<BR>&gt; level 22 get level 16 instead of level 12 pet.. etc)
