<P>> Basically from 1st to 6th level you'll be a

<BR>&gt; questing and rat killing fool. Easiest way
<BR>&gt; to advance. Just keep completing those
<BR>&gt; quests. 3 - 6 flew past me in Greater
<BR>&gt; Faydark. I don't know what quests are
<BR>&gt; available for you in your zone. After 6th
<BR>&gt; you'll be doing the "hack and
<BR>&gt; slash" routine to advance. That takes a
<BR>&gt; bit o work cause lots of things can and will
<BR>&gt; womp you to death. Which brings us to the
<BR>&gt; second question.
<P>&gt; Lots of things will kill you. Use your
<BR>&gt; consider button, if its yellow or red ...
<BR>&gt; run. If your friends, who probably call you
<BR>&gt; a train-er (a really bad thing), do 51% of
<BR>&gt; the damage they get the experience and the
<BR>&gt; loot. Not you. So stick to combats you can
<BR>&gt; win. OR group with 3 or 4 folks your own
<BR>&gt; level. You'll be surprised what you can take
<BR>&gt; on.
<P>I am an 11th ranger around Qeynos, so I know exactly what you are going through! My first three levels were spent around the front gate of qeynos killing everything from rats to bats to my favorite gnoll pups!!! At 4 it's time to move on. Head to the hills and use your track (which is a prime thing to practice for a ranger) and go for the gnolls. Nothing but scouts. And make sure you take on those that con white to blue ONLY!!! Take whites only if you are sure they are alone. After level 4 you have one of two options. Stay around there and kill all the giant rats and gnoll scouts you can find (very slow) OR you can head on into the depths of Blackburrow. I will warn you there are lots of people that populate BB, but when you get a kill, it will move the exp bubble quite a bit!. BEWARE OF TRAINS!!! If you see someone shout train. Move AWAY from the entrance to the zone, cause there is a 99% chance that is where it is heading. 5 - 6th hunt scrawny gnolls 6-8 normal gnolls and patrolling gnolls. 9 - 10 kill giant snakes. At 11th right now I'm hunting guardsman down one at a time, but I've found a better way to gain exp and that's in the aquaducts under qeynos with a party of 3. From there, well we'll just have to find out now won't we :)
<P>There is a guide for a qeynos ranger from levels 1 - 11 for ya! Hope this helps and good luck. As far as skills go, I am putting some into blacksmithing and tailoring in hopes that one day I will be able to make a profit, but it does cost ALOT of money. So, if you do go this route, be prepared to shell it out by the bundle, cause the nearest ore source is High Pass or Beholders Pass where the mudman live (lvl 10 - 14). The only other source is well the PC's that sell it for 1 and 2 gp a small peice!
<P>There ya go...
<BR>May the light shine upon you
