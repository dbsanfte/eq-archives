<P>Well since i played a druid until the 32nd level and being pvp+ i have some knowledge about what a druid can do and can not do during combat.

<P>Druids healing ability:
<P>Well in my opinion druids need to be tweaked because their healing is way to overpowering when combined with their offensive ability, teleports... etc.. at lvl 30 i tested how mana i had and i casted bind(100 mana) 7 times in a row and still had a few mana left over. and once a druid gets to lvl 29 they get greater healing,(2 hps per mana point) so i can heal 400 hps for 200 mana. Since i have 700 mana i can heal about 1300 hps worth of damage assuming that i do not fail, thats 3 greater healings and one normal healing(100 hps for 70 mana). At 30 i dont believe that a wizard can do 1300 points worth of damage, and if they can it can not be much more then 1300hps. which would leave me with a lot of my hps left and then it would come down to melee which i would obviously win.
<P>Damage of offensive spells:
<P>at lvl 29 druids get combust which does 160 damage for 100 mana. So i can do 1020 hps worth of damage using all my mana, again that is assuming i do not fail.
<P>there are some other things that will also play factors, whether the person decides to play a defensive fight or an offensive and the spells that they decide. but if a druid decides just to heal the damage up from a wizard, a wizard will never have a chance assuming that he does not fail his heals. I Think that healing in general needs to be toned down or have a longer casting time, maybe a delay on casting heals other then cleric since he is supposed to be primarily a healer. maybe 15 seconds between heals? that might balance it.
<P>i did not play a pure spell caster at all so if i'm wrong on this let me know. I do not believe that wizards or necro's, etc have any spells that disrupt other then Wizards Force shock which is a 2 second stun i believe. Maybe make more of the spells come with stun or make hte stun time a bit longer say 7 seconds so they could get another spell or two off. Again the only way we can test these things is if we get a few high lvls to fool around with all the different variations of fighting and make sure that everything is well balance
