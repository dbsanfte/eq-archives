<P>> Enumeration:

<P>&gt; 1. A first level character takes a lot of time to build up the
<BR>&gt; cash that they
<BR>&gt; also have the capability of getting 'lucky' and looting off of
<BR>&gt; another character,
<BR>&gt; or getting the money from a higher level friend.
<P>&gt; Your example is a 1st level character running in to where a
<BR>&gt; higher level character was killed and looting their corpse w/o getting
<BR>&gt; killed. Brave fellow, he is.
<P>Bravery has nothing to do with it. Try greed. It's not difficult for a low level character to enter such zones and hang out at the zone exists, waiting for opportunities to loot. This is obvious, lets continue...
<P>&gt; I think that people choose PvP because it's more exciting, and
<BR>&gt; more realistic in many ways. If you die, you frequently lose your
<BR>&gt; cash, and an item. Feel your heart beat while trying to get to that
<BR>&gt; corpse.
<P>This is the same fallacious argument used in UO by advocates of the old PKing system there. There's plenty of excitement by having nearly everyone around you capable of attacking and killing you at any moment. If players frequently die and lose items their characters will become severely handicapped, more so the higher level they become. A lot of lower level players that receive this treatment will quit the server. I've read posts and spoken to a number of players who quit the server due to this looting *BUG*. They have no problem to losing items to PvP, but being looted every time you die to MOBs is too imbalancing to the game environment.
<P>&gt; Elation! No one got there first! Dejection! Someone looted me!
<BR>&gt; Freaking bottomfeeder! I've got to be more careful! Maybe stick
<BR>&gt; my valuable weapon in a bag when I die. Oops, didn't make it
<BR>&gt; into the bag in time. I'm down a lot, and another player is up some.
<P>Good point. The fact that you cannot loot from a bag is due to the dev team not having time to fully implement this feature. You cannot loot an entire container, but you should be able to open one and take an item out of it. I'll make sure to mention this to Verant in my next letter so it can be fixed. Lets call that a *BUG* and move on.
<P>&gt; I suppose because this goes both ways, I should have had a party
<BR>&gt; with me. Maybe I should be adventuring with friends if I want to
<BR>&gt; fight MOBs at level 25, and they can loot for me when I die, yeah!
<P>Congratulations. You are now in a party of 25th level adventurers. You are being shadowed by a party of low level characters intent on looting you. While your friends are engaged with the MOBs and you fall dead at their feet, one of the "bottom feeders" as you call them, rushes in and loots your body before your friends can get to it. Too bad you are all 25+ and these bottom feeders are more than 4 levels below you. Can't attack them. Too bad, so sad eh. With the loot a low level could take off a 25 he can set himself up.
<P>&gt; Anyway, my point is that some planning and some friends can
<BR>&gt; alleviate much of what you consider a problem. But sometimes it won't.
<BR>&gt; There's no 100% certain way of stopping it from happening. A bit like
<BR>&gt; real life.
<P>This is not real-life, it is an online game. Please try to remember that. The point of our discussion is *game balance*. Clearly you are enamored with the idea of being able to win the lottery and pick up some super loot or items from this *BUG*. It's just as clear to myself, and others here, that it creates a game imbalance that we can do without.
<P>&gt; 1. Lower level players can get cash and items out of their level earlier.
<BR>&gt; 2. The person they loot loses an investment.
<BR>&gt; 3. The person who looted can go up in level a bit faster, as he's better equipped.
<P>&gt; Let me know if I missed a point. I don't see where this hurts
<BR>&gt; the game economy, except by people saying that it's obvious that it does. A first
<BR>&gt; or 5th level character in higher level armor still has his skill cap to contend with.
<BR>&gt; Items do NOT make the character. Test this if you want to. I've seen it tested.
<BR>&gt; You have an advantage, but you can't go after creatures out of your range.
<BR>&gt; Rebuttal?
<BR>&gt; -Biggles
<P>My Character: 4th Druid. Journeyman Boots. Runetotem Staff. Full Leather. Full spellbook.
<BR>Your Character: 5th or lower. A few pieces of patchwork. A newbie club. A few spells.
<P>How badly would I have to beat you down with my character before the imbalance became clear to you?
<P>Player(s) I looted: Out Journeyman Boots and Runetotem Staff. Has to spend a literal day or more online camping a spawn point in the hopes that these quest items will one day reappear. In the meantime he has to deal with the other high level PK groups that are also camping these spawn areas, probably dying a few more times and losing further items. I jacked some guys chain chest which I sold for 25pp or so which is financing me for the next four or five levels and has me set for spells. If I die no worries as I have backup weapons in the bank that I purchased.
<P>As for levelling, the average damage over time dealt by a character with a Runetotem Staff is a heck of a lot higher than a newbie club. My armor class is also a heck of a lot better with full leather than a few pieces of patchwork. I am able to kill MOBs in a shorter amount of time while taking less damage myself and using less of my mana healing. With less down time I am able to kill more MOBs and level faster. More importantly I have a distinct advantage over others at my same level when it comes to PvP combat. I've run a lot of tests on the effects of weapons and armor in combat and I'm convinced there's a meaningful difference. If you or anyone else is still not convinced then I suggest you run some tests of your own and post your data here.
