<P>Greetings, I am Kordak the Evil, a Gnome Necromancer, and I bear news from Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer. As you may or may not know, it was prophesied that Bertoxxulous would return to Norrath in the form of a plague and ravish the lands, destroying all opposition. That time is closely at hand. I only seek the truth, and in seeking what is real I have found that only by embracing the plague, *becoming* the plague, can one be spared from this emminent onslaught. We are that plague. We are Genocide.

<P>I know that by now you have decided that this cause is evil and unjust, and to this I can only shake my head. In this day and age, the number of those blindly following a false light is outrageous. Just as the prophets promised so long ago, the plague is complete and unmerciful. Why, then, do so many people accuse the unavoidable as evil and bad? I assure you that if you do decide to join Genocide, you will involve yourself in an epic struggle to bring the truth to Norrath, a struggle that will involve immense conflicts and uncountable battles. This guild is not chaotic, although members do retain most of their freedom. Attacks and occupations will be quite organized, as will the structure and design of all guild functions.
<P>Bertoxxulous shows no mercy, so why should we? "Crimes" such as stealing kills and cheating the ignorant of their money are not frowned upon, and are permitted against any that seek to oppose us. A key guild function will be the occupation of territory, as this will teach those under us who really controls the land. Orc camps, regular fighting zones, caves, dungeons; all shall feel the wrath of Genocide. Many of these occupations will be coordinated and planned, though members are free to do as they see fit.
<P>With so many unable to grasp reality, battles and wars will be inevitable. I have already attempted to undermine the efforts of Sacred Haven, a guild of the foolish, but was unexpectedly cast out while attempting to destroy it from the inside. Sarcoth, their avatar, has already pledged an Enemy Pact against me and has vowed to prevent any action on our part. They, of course, will be taught a lesson on the battlefield when we stand over their corpses laughing. (OOC: Sarcoth and I are quite friendly OOC, and have been collaborating about future conflicts and battles. There can be no doubt about lots of roleplaying opportunities there)
<P>Those who do not worship Bertoxxulous are welcomed with open arms to Genocide. We are glad to accept members who have seen the truth and horror of Norrath and are willing to accept what is real. Any race/class/deity will not be turned down, as we have no prejudice to those who do not oppose us.
<P>OOC: I know I am going to be cast down and condemned by everyone who reads this, but oh well. I really believe those who do decide to join are in for a really great opportunity to roleplay and have fun. Don't immediately rule this guild out because of its strange and, I admit, evil morales. Despite the fact that most of us will be mean in character, I think we are providing a roleplaying opportunity on a server where far too many players are in it for leveling-up and powergaming only (not that I dislike either :). Please reply to this message for any reason, whether you are joining, requesting more information, or flaming me. Once we get going, an official website will be established (which will be professionally done) where the most current guild news and updates will be posted.
