</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>

<BR>There are three concerns that I feel we have near unanimous support for, and I will contact Verant on behalf of the PvP players to request some action. These three items in order of importance are:
<P>#1 The monster looting bug needs to be fixed. This is top priority.
<P>#2 Faction penalties need to be heavy for killing your own race.
<P>#3 Faction guards are fine around their racial home zones, but those placed in outlying areas should be reduced in strength or removed in many cases.
<P>Your idea about not ever dropping a level I don't think will work Once players reach their next level they will go on their killing spree's with no repercussions to dying. The current XP loss levels seem to work well. If a lot of players begin to find the XP losses are too high vs either MOBs or PvP, then we can conisider the idea of reducing the XP loss in these cases. Again from what I've observed I don't see this to be a problem.
<P>&gt; Ok this is just my two cents on improving pvp in EQ. I have come
<BR>&gt; up with four things i think that would really help pvp in
<BR>&gt; Everquest.
<P>&gt; 1. Verant definatly needs to fix the loot bug. Its bad enough
<BR>&gt; when your own race is looting you. But when you have 1st level
<BR>&gt; characters of a different race looting you; then laughing
<BR>&gt; because you cant attack them, its gone far enough.
<P>&gt; 2. I feel that once you level you cant die and go back down a
<BR>&gt; level. Example= Bob hits level eight, now no matter how many
<BR>&gt; times Bob dies he cant go below level eight. Now of course if
<BR>&gt; Bob was real close to level nine and kept on dieing, he would
<BR>&gt; eventually loose alot of experience but never drop below eight
<BR>&gt; again. I think this would help out alot, and not make it become
<BR>&gt; a continous monster bash.
<P>&gt; 3. I think to help out the roleplaying aspects of the game,
<BR>&gt; races should really pay a big penalty if they attack there on
<BR>&gt; kind. Be banished from there home town, by being KOS by the
<BR>&gt; guards would be a good start. The reason for this is because the
<BR>&gt; game is built around Evil and Good, and alot of people are
<BR>&gt; really haveing a blast roleplaying this, but killing in your own
<BR>&gt; race really hurts this. There should be a count set up, that
<BR>&gt; never decays with time. If you kill lets say 8 people in your
<BR>&gt; own race you are then considered a traitor to your own race, and
<BR>&gt; will be guard killed on site.
