<P>*Sighs* Verant has forsaken the Rallos Zek server, Brother. It is turning into an abomination similar to the old UO days! What is going on?!!!!

<P>Why is the debacle they call FACTIONS still in place when it is so obviously imbalanced and messed up (I can go into this if you desire)?
<P>Why have guilds on RZ ONLY been broken for almost 4 weeks now?
<P>Why is there NEVER a GM online on RZ?
<P>Why do DOT's and pet kills cause EXP loss still AND not allow the killer to loot?
<P>DarkenBane Guild was one of the many stricken by the infamous 'unknown guild' bug currently plagueing RZ Norrath. Wednesday evening the guild creator GM (rare appearance) showed up and prompty loaded a NEWBer guild OVER ours! Suddenly a bunch of screaming 3rd levelers were on our guildsay whilst we hunted our foes in KAAOS!
<P>Do you know how unnerving it is to be stalking a high 20 foe in a trick/ambush situation when 10 newbs start begging for stuff? Ugh.
<P>So we asked Mr. GM to fix it and guess what....bam our guildfunctions were gone. Now we don't have ANY means to communicate whilst our hated foes have no such problem.
<P>Mr. GM then made a hasty retreat amid 40 or so petitions about this debacle. Sooooooo Sunday rolls around (the next GM creator date) and loooooooo NO GM even comes online! Would you believe no GM has been on since wed? (at least not visible to us peons).
<P>Chat server GM's just tell us to go to the server gm...Guides know less than we....and our server GM's have forsaken us. I have lost 3 guys (quit the game altogther out of disgust). Some have gon to other servers. Morale is low and Verant is not even bothering to answer our righteous queries.
<P>UO fixed their bugs. They did it to late for me (I will never go back), but is EQ doing the same crap? Is it off to another game for us cause EQ has to many folks playing that they care less for us 70 or 80 folks that are getting screwed by their inattention? All we ask for is someone to simply tell us WTF is going on So we can go back to killing our hated foes in bliss (around the crummy factions too).
<P>If you have the ear of anyone please ask for us what the malfunction is so I can tell my folks.
<P>Thanx
