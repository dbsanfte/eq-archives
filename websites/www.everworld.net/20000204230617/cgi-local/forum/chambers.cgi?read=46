<P>Hi all,

<P>I am an avid Everquest player (more like an addict) and I think I may have
<BR>found something that would make the game better for role-playing. As you all
<BR>know, the way for non-PKs to resolve an issue it to duel it out. However,
<BR>currently there is a major problem with the way this is handled, this is the
<BR>ability to consider your opponent. Personally I never duel anyone that cons
<BR>yellow or red because I know I will lose (I know, if I was truly
<BR>role-playing I would ignore the results of the consider all together and
<BR>happily take the result of my ignorance ) and after talking to many of my
<BR>Everquest friends I have come to the conclusion that I'm not the only one
<BR>out there who plays this way.
<P>As far as I can tell, the ability to duel is only good for people who don't
<BR>use the consider command on their opponents before they challenge them or
<BR>people who will role-play to the bitter end ( I wish there were more of
<BR>you ).
<P>So here is my idea. MAKE THE CONSIDER COMMAND ONLY WORK ON NPCS AND
<BR>MONSTERS, considering other PCs should revile little or nothing about them.
<BR>This way when someone makes the choice to challenge someone else to a duel,
<BR>they will not make that decision because they are relatively sure they will
<BR>win since their opponent cons green or blue. I think this would make for
<BR>much more interesting duels and probably a hole lot more dialog between the
<BR>combatants before the duel.
<P>I know some of you are thinking "This would suck, I would have no idea if I
<BR>am committing suicide or if the duel isn't even worth my time". Well that is
<BR>not completely true. I can almost always tell approximately, how strong
<BR>someone is by watching them fight, where they and their equipment (well
<BR>equipment isn't always a good measure ;-) ). Moreover, if none of these
<BR>signs are visible (out side a city or something), then I shouldn't be able
<BR>to tell how strong another PC is and asking someone to duel should be very
<BR>risky.
<P>Well, what do you all think, Good, Bad or otherwise?
<P>Eli.
