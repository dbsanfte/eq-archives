</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> I like to start by suggesting the idea of PK ranking system that

<BR>&gt; shows top 100 PK'ers of the server. Having such a system will
<BR>&gt; bring much motivation to most PK'ers. The ranking system will be
<BR>&gt; based on War Points, more war points you have the higher the
<BR>&gt; rank you get (duh). The ranking system should have the following
<BR>&gt; rules:
<P>&gt; 1. You gain War Point for a PK frag (I hate to say frag but what
<BR>&gt; the hell hehe)
<BR>&gt; 2. You Lose WarPts when been PK'd (but the victor(s) would gain
<BR>&gt; more Warpoints than what you lose)
<BR>&gt; 3. You gain very little or zero WarPts for killing much lower
<BR>&gt; levels
<BR>&gt; 4. You gain little WarPts for killing someone of your own race.
<BR>&gt; 5. You gain major Warpts for killing a member of your racial
<BR>&gt; hatred.
<BR>&gt; 6. In a group, Warpts will be divided much like how Exp is
<BR>&gt; divided now.
<P>&gt; If such a system is installed in the PvP server, a terrific
<BR>&gt; atmosphere will be possible. Hopefully this will turn into Good
<BR>&gt; vs Evil; where Dark Elves, Trolls, and Ogres VS everyone else.
<BR>&gt; At first there will be some rogue PKers that would PK others of
<BR>&gt; the same race, but if they don't join the system they will be
<BR>&gt; hunted down by their own. The following is my prediction on what
<BR>&gt; will happen:
<P>&gt; 1. The newbies will join the Good while the veterans will join
<BR>&gt; the Evil. However the Good will out number Evil at a large
<BR>&gt; ratio, perhaps 5:1. Also, Evil tend to be hard to play since
<BR>&gt; NPCs hates them too.
<P>&gt; 2. A few strong clans will be formed early for the Evils, since
<BR>&gt; they are veterans they know what to do. They will start PK hunts
<BR>&gt; a lot earliers than the Goods because their newbies are still
<BR>&gt; trying to learn the game.
<P>&gt; 3. The Top100 PK chart will be filled mostly by the Evils, this
<BR>&gt; will result in few Elite Goods to form clans of their own. From
<BR>&gt; here on the fun starts as both sides are organized, however the
<BR>&gt; Good will never be as organized as Evils simply because its
<BR>&gt; harder to organize a larger amount of people. And we all know
<BR>&gt; good Organization is the key to wininng a group battle.
<P>&gt; 4. Now that Good is more organized they will slowly catching up
<BR>&gt; on TOP 100 chart, but Evil isn't slowing down much. There are
<BR>&gt; just too many targets for the Evils and not enough targets for
<BR>&gt; the Goods. The Evils will start doing hit and runs now, preying
<BR>&gt; on the solo's and run as soon as a well organized Party of Good
<BR>&gt; come to fight.
<P>&gt; 5. At this point you might think the Good is definitely losing
<BR>&gt; the war, but here is when a large amount of people will shine:
<BR>&gt; City raids! As I recall I read somewhere that city raids is
<BR>&gt; possible if you are in a group of high levels. Well, raiding a
<BR>&gt; city is definitely will be easier for the Goods than the Evils.
<BR>&gt; While this could be a lot of fine, one wrong move and the whole
<BR>&gt; raiding party will be in chaos as being chased down by NPC
<BR>&gt; guards while the Evils return back to their city to take
<BR>&gt; advantage of easy kills. Again, organization is the key here.
<P>&gt; 6. End Result: The Good will have many Elite Clans, but there
<BR>&gt; will be a large amount of Rouge PKers. So most likely half of
<BR>&gt; TOP Good PKer's warpt will come from killing Rogue PKs. The
<BR>&gt; Evil, as organized as ever, are more likely to result in a large
<BR>&gt; civil war (clan vs clan). From my personal experience, awesome
<BR>&gt; PKers come with large egos, and when the egos clashes the civil
<BR>&gt; war begins. There will also be some defected members from the
<BR>&gt; other side. For example a human monk will probably like to
<BR>&gt; associate with friends from Troll clan, however in doing so this
<BR>&gt; human monk must be very well known in the Evil Side as well as
<BR>&gt; being protected by his Troll friends. Otherwise you will be kill
<BR>&gt; on sight by those who doesn't know you are on their side.
<P>&gt; I always believed in organized PK is more fun than random
<BR>&gt; killing; its just much funner to PK someone that you know
<BR>&gt; instead of a faceless stranger. And once the TOP100 ranking
<BR>&gt; system is installed, you get a feeling (could be personal hatred
<BR>&gt; or admiration) toward someone in the list. There is one major
<BR>&gt; flaw that I'm aware of this system. Spies, with 10 character per
<BR>&gt; server you can very easily create spies to infiltrate and become
<BR>&gt; a member of the enemy clan, and then during crucial moments you
<BR>&gt; give feedbacks to your friend of the other Side. For this reason
<BR>&gt; I always believe in small clans are better than large guilds.
<P>&gt; One last note, about message boards. I also like to propose
<BR>&gt; multiple in-game message boards. One board for Good only (to
<BR>&gt; discuss tactics among elite clans, but vulnerable to spies), one
<BR>&gt; board for Evil only, and one for everyone (to talk trash with
<BR>&gt; the other side I guess hehe). And obviously the Good message
<BR>&gt; boards will be located only in cities of Good, same for Evil. By
<BR>&gt; having it this way, it makes a good goal for city raids. This
<BR>&gt; will probably be the primary goal of a city raid because most
<BR>&gt; PCs of the raided city will flee (or camp to log out) before you
<BR>&gt; even enter the city. Nothing gives you more satisfaction of
<BR>&gt; leaving insults in enemy message board to have them remember
<BR>&gt; your presence in their very home. Once the clan houses are
<BR>&gt; available to be purchased, hopefully the clan house also carries
<BR>&gt; a message board. It will feel much more presonal when an enemy
<BR>&gt; posted 'thank you' notes in your clan board for donating them of
<BR>&gt; what was in your clan storage =).
<P>&gt; The ideas I suggested in this post shouldn't be very hard to
<BR>&gt; implement but will add great atmosphere to the game. Hopefully
<BR>&gt; the developers are paying attention. Btw, my suggestions here
<BR>&gt; are aimed for PvP server, although normal servers can benefit
<BR>&gt; from these as well. (crossing my fingers that there will be a
<BR>&gt; PvP server in final release).

<P>Excellent ideas, you have really put a lot of thought into this have you had PvP experience in other onkine games such as UO?
