<P>I havent been reading these boards at all, but I just got done reading that long article about EQ's bad form of PK, and I just wanted to throw my few cents into the fray.

<P>I too have seen other methods of anti-PKing. One MUD I was on had no barriers what-so-ever. The only "coded" restriction they had was first and second level characters couldnt not be stolen/attacked/etc.... But that is it. PKing was completely against the MUDs policy however, and if someone killed you, you just had to report them to a GM, which would deal with it accordingly. First offenses usually got a warning. Later on they get locked out of the game for periods of time, and on extreme cases permanently.
<BR>Also, there was a 3 or 4 a day rule. You get locked out for the remainder of the day if you kill more than 4 people in one day.
<P>Now this didnt mean you couldnt RP a killer. I myself got in many "fights", which one of us (or more, groups attacking were not uncommon) ended up dead. The thing is we all were RPing the events, so no one ever called the GMs, and no one felt abused. There were even tournaments to the death, held by normal characters just organizing an event. In the upwards of 10 people per two teams would go at it in a small cluster of rooms. It was all part of the fun.
<P>Now here is where I agree with the article in that EQ took the easy way out. I didnt go on the PK server because I knew that was where all the "attack anything that moves" PKers would go to. But personally, being +PK adds more realism to the game. I am not going to go out killing everything I see, but to be able to if needed, and also to know that someone can sneak up and kill me, keeps you on your toes.
<P>I am +PK, and ive noticed on the server im on (Marr), there are very very few of us. The most annoying part is that I cannot get healed, no one can cast helpful spells on me, and I cant cast helpful spells on someone else. This is the biggest problem, and it exagerates the "2 camps" the article wass talking about. The only thing positive I have to say about it is it really helps me RP my dark elf, because it all the more alienates him from everyone else, which he is all to glad about. Being the only red in a group of blue sets you apart from everyone else, and also the added fact that so many people automatically mistrust someone that is PVP.
