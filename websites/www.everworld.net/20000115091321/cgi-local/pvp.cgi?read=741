<P>I really don't like the fact that you will -always- be penalized for killing people of your own race. I know that if it weren't there, we'd have the k3wL kR3w wreaking havoc because of it, but having it this way hurts any type of roleplaying. Until I read about this, I already had a plan for what my character/guild would be like; a group of elves/humans, generally only fighting drow, ogres, trolls and such, but we look at barbarians and dwarves as lesser races, and with some provocation, would fight them as well. But under this system, if we try to play this role (I really mean role play, not make excuses to kill whoever we want), then we get terrible penalties. Same for anyone who wants to REALLY role play a bandit, brigand, highwayman, assassin, or any profession like this. Kind of silly for a rogue who chooses to be an unscrupulous thief to sneak off to a troll town and try to rob them when they recognize him on sight and KOS him, when he could do the same thing to people of his race. But, again, under this system, this makes his life hell, and nearly unplayable. I really don't have any ideas for how to deal with this, because I know removing it would open the door for UO type killing, and I'm the last person who'd want that here, but I really don't like this system, and maybe someone has ideas on how it could be improved. Anyone have any suggestions?
