<P>it HAS been tested....you not having been in the beta does not invalidate the testing that was done there.....it's my opinion that in it's present state it will fail...if changes are made, it may succeed....if changes are made to appease the masses that end up allowing the l3TT to gain a more significant foothold on the PvP server, all is lost....changes of this type are EXACTLY what this board (in general) seems to be asking for.....i'm trying to explain to you all the things you need to be worrying about when you start throwing around posts "Verant shuld do away with levels"........perhaps this board was actually created for all of you to lurk like hyeanas until someone showed up whose opinion you didn't care for and then, in unison and with a complete disregard for the facts in his statements, make some pathetic attempt to crucify him with your witless rebuttals

<P>&gt; Why was this board created? simply to give people a constructive
<BR>&gt; area to relate ideas about PVP in EQ or thats what I thought.
<P>&gt; It seems to me everyone has prejudged and labeled PVP in EQ
<BR>&gt; before it has even seen the light of day. I have no concerns
<BR>&gt; either way (it will not effect my game play or attitude) I just
<BR>&gt; find it intresting that this board about PVP is twisted into a
<BR>&gt; debate of how it will fail..countered by rebuttales by people
<BR>&gt; who support it (or just have an open mind)
<P>&gt; I would like to see it tested if it makes its than so be it.
<P>&gt; if it doesnt so be it..
