<P>I have a few comments.

<P>First I have to congratulate most of you on the lucidity and inteligence with which you express your opinions. That said, I see most of these posts as a thinly disguised lament to "logic" Verant into making EQ accessible to open PvP. It appears that you, all of you, just cannot stand the idea that given the choice most people on EQ have opted NOT to PvP and that the "switch" is such an insurmountable deterrent to what you consider fun.
<P>Funny that even though you will have gotten your own EQ PvP server it does not seem enough - you want to "force" us all to accept some sort of PvP on every server, a scenario which means that our choice not to PvP at all disappears.
<P>Not very sensitive of you is it?
<P>As it stands now EQ has given us the +PvP / -PvP choice in the best way they know of and that choice has been embraced by well over ninety five opercent of the EQ players thus far. Why do you find this impossible to accept? Why are you not satisfied with the abiliity kill each other and leave us alone?
<P>Of course there are times when I have wished for the ability to off some idiot who is being a pain but by in large I am more than happy to have to forego that "pleasure" for the serenity to be able to role play and explore without worrying about being jumped by twenty homicidal maniacs during my strolls or losing that which I have worked so hard to obtain.
<P>There is, despite your protestations and suggestions, no extant way of regulating PvP. No matter how this has been tried all such attempts have been futile, ending up in the dreaded generation of PvP "gang-bangers" who suffer no real loss of anything worthwhile while having the ability to kill anyone moving, newbies being a special treat. No matter what the restriction some clever person has always found a way to circumvent it - until the "switch". You might even say that the failure of +PvPs to police or restrain themselves whatsoever on anything like a global scale in previous games led to your own downfall.
<P>If I want to fight someone I can always challenge them to duel. This is fair and reasonable. If they don't respond - well - then I guess I was the better man so to speak. In this way may I point out that you CAN fight anyone of any level and I see the anti-level restriction comments as nothing more than a thinly disguised attempt to institute open player hunting on EQ, something that I hope never comes about.
<P>I respect your opinions ladies and gentlemen PvPs but you already have an RPG where you can pretty much kill to your hearts content despite the efforts of the designers to limit it and we do not yet have the opposite opportunity.
<P>Face it. EQ is, for the forseeable future, going to stay exactly the way it is until and unless the game flops badly enough in commercial release to force Verant into a decision to open it to PvP without a choice. The only choice that you now have however, is to accept this or move to the PvP server.
<P>We -PvPs have played by "your rules" for too long. Now you'll have to play by oours for awhile. Interesting isn't it? The whining so long the openly derided province of the -PvP has now shifted to the +PvP group. If you meant half what you've said in the past you'll accept this and move on to play the game as it is designed. If not -- well perhaps you are not really all that tolerant, accepting and the all around good sports you used to tell us WE should be when the shoe was on the other foot.
<P>Play the game. If it is not fun for you then show your distaste by not playing the game, but as you once told us -PvPs, grow up and accept what now is.
<P>Respectfully,
<P>Warsword Keenblade
