<P>

<BR>First and foremost, there is a PvP community. It is not made up entirely of k00l d00dz as you like to put it, and it is certainly larger than the 10% you mention. Several months ago Stratics ran a survey on PvP on UO players, asking which were interested in PvP/PK and which were against it. A majority (that's over 50% for those not mathematically gifted), were interested in PvP and participated in PvP on a regular basis. Somewhere between 20% to 25% fell into the category of PK, either being full time PKs or having no inhibitions about killing other players.
<P>Many of the facts you mentioned are true however. Verant did design Everquest to be a PvE game, and yes PvP was added as more of an afterthough. Most of us in the PvP community realize this and have for quite some time now. Even so, Brad has stated that he would address PvP issues in Phase IV and balancing the PvP game insofar as it does not compromise the PvE balance. Whether this will happen or not I cannot say. Given that the dev team is currently focusing on fixing bugs for the release I don't expect much to be done in the way of correcting PvP problems, but I am not ready to give up hope on this game yet and write it off.
<P>I'm always amazed at the lack of intellect shown by some "role players" in their blind flaming of PvP issues and players. As a group that tends to idealize it's role in the online comminity as being better than the masses, I would expect more. Th ePvP community as a whole does not want to force it's system onto the RP community. The changes we are asking for are specific to PvP, and at least as far as my suggestions go, stipulate that the current PvE balance be left as-is. The truth of the matter is that many RPers just can't stand the idea of their ideal world being overrun by happy PvP players who would not share their RPing fervor. The RPers dread the thought that Everquest could be an interesting PvP experience, and that would in turn draw thousands of more players to the servers who would just as soon hack you down without even the pleasantries of exchanging a "have at thee!"
<P>Fortunately Everquest features a PvP switch which preserves our styles of game play and prevents those who don't want to partake in PvP from becoming victims of it. Verant has also been so kind as to offer an exclusive PvP server, yet another method of seperating the two styles of gaming. What remains now is to modify the system as much as is feasable to support PvP so that players who choose to do so can enjoy that part of the game. To that end, we the PvP community kindly ask you to butt out of our business. "Pray thee sir, take thine flames elsewhere!"
<P>TheBlack BCK
<BR>- card carrying member of the PvP Community
<P>&gt; when Verant sat down and made this game in the first place, they
<BR>&gt; wanted to make a very ROLEPLAYING oriented game.......i'm not
<BR>&gt; saying this is good or bad, it's just the way it is....they set
<BR>&gt; out to build a online COMMUNITY....these are guys who seem to
<BR>&gt; have played endless MUD's and have made EQ very much like the
<BR>&gt; MUD's they have played......MUD's are also about community......
<P>&gt; now the problem with this in regardes to PvP is that PvP is not
<BR>&gt; a community (at least not as defined by the sensiblities of the
<BR>&gt; rest of the world)......to "normal" players, you guys
<BR>&gt; appear to be people who want to destroy any sense of community
<BR>&gt; they may exist and the sad truth is, the guys who made the game
<BR>&gt; are the "normal" players.......
<P>&gt; to "normal" players, UO was a game that was overrun by
<BR>&gt; k3wLd00d l33t Hax0R69 types and sucked miserably....i understand
<BR>&gt; that you guys enjoyed it, fair enough.......now, not to be
<BR>&gt; speaking on behalf of the dev team, but it sure as shit seems to
<BR>&gt; me that most of the rules set forth in EQ thus far have been
<BR>&gt; solely to control the k3wLd00d l33t Hax0R69's out there and not
<BR>&gt; allow them to ruin anyone else's game, which is what you did in
<BR>&gt; UO.....u took UO and made it fun for yourselves at the expense
<BR>&gt; of everyone who wasn't one of you...OSI tried to stop you for
<BR>&gt; some time, but since you were so l33t (hahaha) you found ways to
<BR>&gt; exploit the system, you found work-arounds to any anti-PK
<BR>&gt; mechanism that was implemented and continued to ruin the game
<BR>&gt; for the "normal" player....you basically took what was
<BR>&gt; supposed to be a roleplaying game and turned it into a stupid
<BR>&gt; frag-fest action game.....OSI was too dumb to stop you and was
<BR>&gt; eventually forced to play ball your way (because you were the
<BR>&gt; only paying customers left after having driven away all the
<BR>&gt; "normal" players)....
<P>&gt; to you guys UO was about how BAD you could be....it was a huge
<BR>&gt; pissing contest to see who could slaughter the most newbies, and
<BR>&gt; who could behave in the most antisocial way possible...this is
<BR>&gt; what you liked about the game...the way to "win" in UO
<BR>&gt; seems to have been to be more famous for being a prick than the
<BR>&gt; next guy (that's all i've heard anyone say on this board for the
<BR>&gt; last couple of days)....i don't pretend to understand it, but i
<BR>&gt; guess i have to respect it.........my problem with what you did
<BR>&gt; to UO was when people called you out for being snot-nosed, jr
<BR>&gt; high kids and you chose (for the most part) to defend your style
<BR>&gt; of gameplay by asserting how "in-character" and
<BR>&gt; "roleplaying" slaughtering hoardes of innocents was
<BR>&gt; because you were "roleplaying" an evil
<BR>&gt; character.......sigh.......you all know as well as i do that the
<BR>&gt; notion of a world populated entirely by serial killers is the
<BR>&gt; most unrealistic thing there is.....again, OSI's fault for not
<BR>&gt; making their world real enough....you see, kiddies, in the real
<BR>&gt; world when bad people do bad things, they are PUNISHED...and,
<BR>&gt; typically, the punishment reflects the seriousness of the
<BR>&gt; crime....murder being one of the more serious offences, any
<BR>&gt; logically thinking human being would conclude that the
<BR>&gt; punishment for murder would be pretty damn stiff...it
<BR>&gt; wasn't...in fact, it wasn't punished to any legitimate degree at
<BR>&gt; all and in the popular culture on UO servers, it was encouraged
<BR>&gt; and admired....EQ knows better
<P>&gt; EQ has not made the same errors in game design that made your
<BR>&gt; vision of "serial killer land" possible....you will
<BR>&gt; have to live with this...waht made UO fun for you was , in fact,
<BR>&gt; just a clinic in poor design.....Verant has taken the time to
<BR>&gt; make, IMHO, a pretty damned realistic world in which your
<BR>&gt; actions , both dastardly and saintly, seem to have some very
<BR>&gt; real affect on your ability to play the game....this is
<BR>&gt; GOOD...good in the sense that peopel in Norrath will be forced
<BR>&gt; to behave within certain guidelines just like people in teh real
<BR>&gt; world are forced to behave within certain guidelines.......now
<BR>&gt; you'll all say "...but i don't want no r00ls, that shIt is
<BR>&gt; for FaGs....i WaNnA d0 wHAt i WanT....If I WanT to r0l3Play a
<BR>&gt; eViLL(tm) cHar, Th3N i ShouLd b3 abL3 to".....the truth is,
<BR>&gt; you want to play quake, and you want to force everyone to play
<BR>&gt; quake with you.......killing anyone who happens to walk by is
<BR>&gt; NOT roleplaying....roleplaying is behaving the way you believe
<BR>&gt; your character would behave in some fantasy setting......in any
<BR>&gt; reasonable society people are punished for killing
<BR>&gt; innocents....you char would know this before he started killin
<BR>&gt; innocents and wouldn't do it...if he did, he would be punished
<BR>&gt; severly (prolly killed, which would make your in-game experince
<BR>&gt; a little different, eh?)....
<P>&gt; so NOW, you jokers are placed into a situation where you will be
<BR>&gt; forced to roleplay, where the world will fight back(just like
<BR>&gt; the real world) against it's criminal element and you're all
<BR>&gt; crying the blues about it....well cry me a river, monkey boy,
<BR>&gt; cause that's the way it is.....maybe this PvP server is a good
<BR>&gt; idea after all, it's actually a brilliant move on Verant's
<BR>&gt; part...they can quarantine al you assholes and isolate you from
<BR>&gt; people who want to actually play Everquest as opposed to
<BR>&gt; EverQuake......for the cost of another server and whatever
<BR>&gt; they're paying geiger, they can maintain their initial
<BR>&gt; game-design vision without the likes of you ruining it for
<BR>&gt; everyone else nd turn it into something it's not supposed to
<BR>&gt; be.....
<P>&gt; so, in a sense, you win.....you get your "serial killer
<BR>&gt; world"....have at it, jerk off.....but for god's sake if i
<BR>&gt; see one more post on this board demanding that Verant re-write
<BR>&gt; all their code to amke the game more fun for you guys, i'll go
<BR>&gt; mad.........in this case, my friends, you guys are the
<BR>&gt; minority...the game wasn't designed with you in mind and won't
<BR>&gt; be re-written to accomodate you...you're lucky enough that you
<BR>&gt; have your own server
<P>&gt; in the end, i believe PvP is doomed........Verant will NOT
<BR>&gt; re-write huge chunks of code (basically, what you seem to be
<BR>&gt; asking is for them to throw their whole level/skills out the
<BR>&gt; window and re-do it just for you) to accomodate you (whom
<BR>&gt; "normal" players consider to be a very annoying
<BR>&gt; degnerate case)......you d00ds are typical regarded as a probelm
<BR>&gt; that a game must be designed around....the bottom line is that
<BR>&gt; Verant, in all likeliehood, will honor NONE of your requsts and
<BR>&gt; you'll be playing the game, in respect to PvP, just as it is now
<BR>&gt; for a good long time .......there just simply isn't enough time
<BR>&gt; to develop two games concurrently and you'll be the ones that
<BR>&gt; are sacrificed for the good of the other........once the light
<BR>&gt; of day fianlly filters thru your thick skulls and you REALIZE
<BR>&gt; that PvP was put into ths game as an afterthought and this
<BR>&gt; REALLY isn't meant to be a PvP game, you'll get bored
<BR>&gt; (hopefully) and go back to UO or wherever it is you came from
<BR>&gt; and probably talk shit about what a horrible game this was for
<BR>&gt; years to come (..much like the way us "normal" players
<BR>&gt; still talk shit abou how bad UO sucked to this
<BR>&gt; day).........maybe i'm wrong, maybe Verant will spawn a daughter
<BR>&gt; company (VerantPvP inc) to re-write the entire game so that the
<BR>&gt; degenarate case 10% of the market will also buy it along with
<BR>&gt; the "normal" players........but i wouldn't hold my
<BR>&gt; breath ;)
<P>&gt; ps ...the sad truth is that i initially cam onto this board as
<BR>&gt; an advocate of PvP....i didn't believe that the k3wL d00d
<BR>&gt; HaXoR69's really were so prevalent in the PvP
<BR>&gt; "community".......i was really hoping i'd find some
<BR>&gt; mature, intelligent people who could understand the diffence
<BR>&gt; between in-character PvP and EverQuake.......i have obviously
<BR>&gt; been shown the error of my ways and now humbly go back to join
<BR>&gt; the "normal" players.......as much as i liked the idea
<BR>&gt; of more developed PvP, i find that i must sacrifice that to keep
<BR>&gt; all the k3wL d00d HaXoR69's away from me so i can just play the
<BR>&gt; damn game MY way and not be forced to adapt my style to your
<BR>&gt; style (...and in so doing, givivng up many of the things i find
<BR>&gt; fun about the game just to survive).....enjoy your server and
<BR>&gt; have a nice day ;)

<TD COLSPAN=2><P><STRONG><font face=arial size=2>Message:</STRONG>
<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=70 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; First and foremost, there is a PvP community. It is not made up 
&gt; entirely of k00l d00dz as you like to put it, and it is 
&gt; certainly larger than the 10% you mention. Several months ago 
&gt; Stratics ran a survey on PvP on UO players, asking which were 
&gt; interested in PvP/PK and which were against it. A majority 
&gt; (that's over 50% for those not mathematically gifted), were 
&gt; interested in PvP and participated in PvP on a regular basis. 
&gt; Somewhere between 20% to 25% fell into the category of PK, 
&gt; either being full time PKs or having no inhibitions about 
&gt; killing other players. 

&gt; Many of the facts you mentioned are true however. Verant did 
&gt; design Everquest to be a PvE game, and yes PvP was added as more 
&gt; of an afterthough. Most of us in the PvP community realize this 
&gt; and have for quite some time now. Even so, Brad has stated that 
&gt; he would address PvP issues in Phase IV and balancing the PvP 
&gt; game insofar as it does not compromise the PvE balance. Whether 
&gt; this will happen or not I cannot say. Given that the dev team is 
&gt; currently focusing on fixing bugs for the release I don't expect 
&gt; much to be done in the way of correcting PvP problems, but I am 
&gt; not ready to give up hope on this game yet and write it off. 

&gt; I'm always amazed at the lack of intellect shown by some 
&gt; &quot;role players&quot; in their blind flaming of PvP issues 
&gt; and players. As a group that tends to idealize it's role in the 
&gt; online comminity as being better than the masses, I would expect 
&gt; more. Th ePvP community as a whole does not want to force it's 
&gt; system onto the RP community. The changes we are asking for are 
&gt; specific to PvP, and at least as far as my suggestions go, 
&gt; stipulate that the current PvE balance be left as-is. The truth 
&gt; of the matter is that many RPers just can't stand the idea of 
&gt; their ideal world being overrun by happy PvP players who would 
&gt; not share their RPing fervor. The RPers dread the thought that 
&gt; Everquest could be an interesting PvP experience, and that would 
&gt; in turn draw thousands of more players to the servers who would 
&gt; just as soon hack you down without even the pleasantries of 
&gt; exchanging a &quot;have at thee!&quot; 

&gt; Fortunately Everquest features a PvP switch which preserves our 
&gt; styles of game play and prevents those who don't want to partake 
&gt; in PvP from becoming victims of it. Verant has also been so kind 
&gt; as to offer an exclusive PvP server, yet another method of 
&gt; seperating the two styles of gaming. What remains now is to 
&gt; modify the system as much as is feasable to support PvP so that 
&gt; players who choose to do so can enjoy that part of the game. To 
&gt; that end, we the PvP community kindly ask you to butt out of our 
&gt; business. &quot;Pray thee sir, take thine flames 
&gt; elsewhere!&quot;
