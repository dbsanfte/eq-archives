<P>I'm not actually playing this game yet, but i will be in about a week :)

<BR>Even though i haven't actually played, i've been studying everything EQ for some time now and i do have an opinion of how i'd like the pvp system to work.
<P>Killing people of your own race is a very immoral thing to do, however, being able to attack other races that's supposed to be your enemy should be a quite natural thing in an RPG.
<BR>As far as i'm concerned, there shouldn't have to be different kinds of servers, there should be some way to solve the matter in another fashion.
<P>It should be impossible to killa anyone of your own race or at least the killer should have to pay dearly for doing such a low thing, like being banned from every friendly town as well as losing lots of experience. Killing allied races should result in being banned from the towns of that race as well as loosing lots of experience. Killing someone of an enemy race should be ok, same as killing a monster. The towns of the killed one should put up a "wanted" sign and give a reward to whoever manages to kill the murderer, this would make it possible for people to earn money as bounty hunters. People who joins a group shouldn't be able to kill eachother once they've joined, even if they're different races they've signed a "contract" :) This way groups could benefit from the abilities of all races.
<BR>I think this would add to realism a lot as well as preventing the EQ community from splitting into 2 sides, wich i think it will eventually do if different types of servers remains for too long :/
<BR>With this system, PK's who enjoys ruining for others would have a hard time killing their own, the experience loss and banning from towns would make it close to impossible to gain experience/levels and they'd eventually grow sick of bugging others around. This way it would also be possible to have good vs evil battles now and then, cause what's the point of having good and evil races if they can't do eachother any harm?
<BR>I realize this is a +pvp only conference, but wouldn't you rather see it possible to kill enemy races on all the EQ servers as well as not having to worry about a nation of psychos killing you for no reason but to spoil your fun?
