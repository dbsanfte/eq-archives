<P>I approached Everquest with it in my head that I would compete against the environment. I wanted to conquer the games challenges provided to me exclusively from what Verant programmed into it. Taking on quests for magical items or gold. Rescue the princess from the orcs. Deliver a package to a mage half way across the world. That is how I approached the beta test and stuck to it for the most part.

<P>Then one day I got a wild hair and decided to try the PVP Server. I will share with you my initial experience after entering the PVP Server. I have had many excursions on the PVP, but this is what turned me on to it.
<P>I quickly generated a wizard and entered Erudin. After finding my guild, i proceeded outside Erudin to see what was going on. I walked around in the darkness, killed a couple of creatures and explored the countryside a little. Then out of nowhere, i got attacked and quickly dispatched by a Necromancer who happened upon me. My character regenerated at the Erudin entrance, then I ran into the same guy again who promptly attacked me and killed me. At first I was pissed and almost logged out and returned to the nice safe world of Fennin Ro. But then an emotion took me over....REVENGE!
<P>I have to admit that my roleplaying participation increased as a result of my experience of getting offed by this rogue Necromancer. I quickly began to befriend other low level newbies such as I, some of whom were also attacked and killed by that Necro. This took a considerable amout of roleplaying mind you. I befriended a fighter, a cleric and an Enchanter. The four of us advanced a couple of levels and then began our hunt for mister Necromancer. We soon found him and were able to take him down together, loot his corpse of gold and an item and send him packing. Without question the most satisfying ROLEPLAYING experience of my EQ endeavors thus far. This scenario is almost impossible on the other servers.
<P>I would also like to point out that the other servers are not what I would call roleplaying servers. Not everyone, not even close to the majority of the people on those servers are what I would consider roleplayers. The vast majority of them are powergamers who roam the countryside killing creatures, looting their corpses, returning to town to sell their stuff...rinse lather repeat. There is no roleplaying there. There isn't even really any danger. The consequences of death are minimal and you can always get your stuff back for the most part.
<P>I would contend that if one wanted to experience true roleplaying...give the PVP server a shot. You will experience randomly occuring events not available to you in the other servers. To me, this element of random danger is more representative to what it would really be like to exist in Norrath. You will have true enemies to watch out for and races you are truely at war with (unlike on the other servers). You can set up ambushes to take down a member of a rival guild or capture (root) and interrogate him for information under the threat of death. Beware of that action though, for you might be the one ambushed next time! Alignment (good, neutral, evil etc) will actually play a role in your characters life. A Dark Elf invasion of Freeport can actually happen ( how can you invade a city when you cant attack its citizens because they are non pvp?). I cant tell you how many times I saw a Paladin wandering around with a Necromancer in the Fennin Ro server. See, they both had blue names above their heads and were basically on the same side; people against the environment. I figured that Paladins and Necromancers would be mortal enemies!? I didn't see that in the PVP server so much. Remember that Everquest is a game that, when you get right down to it, is about good versus evil. You are supposed to choose which side of that equation to champion.
<P>On the PVP server everyone had a ROLE to play...they were either good or evil (some neutral) and would do their respective duties and try to eliminate their enemies. Thats why the Necromancer attacked me in the forest. When you play on the safe house type servers, how can you play a role in relationship to the other people in your world?? When you are playing on the Xegony or Fennin Ro servers and you are evil, good players have nothing to fear from you because you cant attack them (unless they consent to a duel...which was very rarely) and vice versa. Where is the realism in that? More importantly, you are eliminating what attracted you to this game to begin with; the dynamic relationship you share with the 1000 other players in the game. You should be playing with AND against them. If I am an Elven wizard from Felwithe and see a Dark Elf in my realm, there is nothing I would rather do than slay that vile creature and send him back to the Nektulos Forest where he belongs! An option unavailable to me on the non-pvp servers.
<P>Now don't get me wrong, I still feel that taking on the GM or game provided quests is still important. There is no greater reward than completing a quest given to you. But that added realism of danger around every corner from the quest as well as the other players makes for even a better challenge.
<P>I will be participating on the PVP server. It offers more realism, danger and roleplaying opportunities than the other servers. I look forward to making friends AND enemies there. Sure, I will get killed and that sword I worked so hard to buy will get looted from my corpse....but hey, thats life!!
