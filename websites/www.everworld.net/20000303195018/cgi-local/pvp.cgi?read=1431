<P>> The PvP server will definitley be there in final. I'll have to

<BR>&gt; admit, at the beginning of phase 4 I thought it would take a bit
<BR>&gt; longer for the PvP to fall in the place than it did. It was
<BR>&gt; quite fun throughout the duration of phase 4, playing in the
<BR>&gt; Race wars that happened. It wasn't often but enough that I saw
<BR>&gt; people killing out of role that concerned me. My last night on
<BR>&gt; the server, I logged in as a HighElf (known to have a great deal
<BR>&gt; of charisma) and was immediately attacked by another Highelf
<BR>&gt; with a moronic name. I know quite a few people that spent 12
<BR>&gt; hours a day on the server, neither were 100% sure they were
<BR>&gt; going to play on the PvP server in the final. Not that they
<BR>&gt; didn't have fun or didn't enjoy that extra drama that the PvP
<BR>&gt; server, its just that the PvP server acted as a cap for their
<BR>&gt; fun in the following ways:
<P>Yup I and over 40 others tried pvp for around 2 weeks or so. We have firmly decided against it. Not so much because of random slaying but what we saw the server evolving into. There was no sense at all of being in Norrath, it was simply another set of rules for powergaming guilds to assert thier bragging rights at the cost of any players around them.
<P>&gt; #1) If you play too much you will be so much higher than
<BR>&gt; everyone else, you can't PvP or it will be as often as it is
<BR>&gt; playing as PvP on a non PvP server.
<P>heh, never found being too high level a problem!
<P>&gt; #2) You put in a great deal of hours and pick up a nice set of
<BR>&gt; armor, only to find a group of people that think they'd look
<BR>&gt; better in your armor than you do. In or out of role the time
<BR>&gt; spent collecting your armor and weapons, it can be extremely
<BR>&gt; frustrating.
<P>Yeh looting from pve deaths needs to be fixed. IE: if some dewd decides my staff looks good as I am near dead from a dervish, he should only be able to loot if he does the normal 51%+ damage required in pve. Maybe not realistic but the benefits would outweigh the losses. This would stop a lot of the random killing motivate by nothing other than greed.
<P>&gt; We have to face it, there are people out there that will do what
<BR>&gt; ever makes them happy no matter what the cost. There will be
<BR>&gt; people out there who like to play on the PvP server yet will PK
<BR>&gt; new characters just because they can (Lvl 3 killing Lvl 1) and
<BR>&gt; chase away people who will actually serve to ensure the life of
<BR>&gt; the PvP server. A friend of mine was attacked by a darkelf
<BR>&gt; infront of a guard. She (Dark Elf) was swiftly dispatched by the
<BR>&gt; guard and my friend looted a nice shield from her. I personally
<BR>&gt; see nothing wrong with this considering she iniated the combat,
<BR>&gt; however her husband msg my friend out of role complaining that
<BR>&gt; his wife didn’t know and she was mad at him now and “This isn’t
<BR>&gt; about a game its about real life”. Talk about unrealistic
<BR>&gt; epectations. A Wood Elf showing compasion for a Dark Elf that
<BR>&gt; attacked him and then died and if he doesn’t he’s an “ASSHOLE”.
<BR>&gt; BAH…
<P>Unfortunately the vast majority of the hardcore pvp's here don't want to play in character. In fact the vehemently complain\flame if anything is suggested to hinder their ability to kill whoever they want without ingame consequences. They keep preaching for a player enforced system which I doubt will work well enough to keep anyone but themselves playing on the server.
<P>&gt; Here is my take on where we go from here:
<P>&gt; I had a notorious Gnome Necro on the PvP server (It was one of
<BR>&gt; the characters my roomate and I shared, but I played 90% with
<BR>&gt; the Necro the few weeks before the end of the Beta).. I tasted
<BR>&gt; PvP in many forms, killing Dark Elves and Trolls and the
<BR>&gt; occasional Ogre, I never killed my own kind or any Humans that I
<BR>&gt; can remember (that didn’t deserve it). My actions for the most
<BR>&gt; part were a fairly accurate representation of what was going on,
<BR>&gt; on the server. I wouldn’t call it killing in Role as much as I
<BR>&gt; would call it killing in Race. Aside from the +/-4 lvl limit
<BR>&gt; there isn’t much of a restriction on who you kill (no factions
<BR>&gt; yet) this makes it quite difficult to rely on other people to
<BR>&gt; “Kill right”. Another thing people forget is that just because
<BR>&gt; this is a PvP server it doesn’t mean we have to spend all of our
<BR>&gt; time on the server killing everything, or obtaining a lvl so you
<BR>&gt; get cool spells to kill people. The server needs something. We
<BR>&gt; need to police ourselves as to not destroy the freedom we have
<BR>&gt; to PvP at will (+/-4). We need to throw some roleplay into our
<BR>&gt; recipe.
<P>Read Tarquins post, it appears some see the world of EQ as nothing more than xp numbers and obstacles in their way of dominating other players.
<P>&gt; I would love nothing more than to spend all my time in Everquest
<BR>&gt; enhancing everyone elses game play via Quests, roleplaying and
<BR>&gt; indepth and detailed storylines. Is it going to be worth my
<BR>&gt; effort? (My effort normally goes to the extreme when I do
<BR>&gt; things) I don’t know if it will or won’t at this moment in time.
<BR>&gt; The PvP server can’t and in my opinion won’t exist off of what
<BR>&gt; we had towards the end of phase 4. It has the potential. I
<BR>&gt; believe strongly that the problems don’t fall at all with the
<BR>&gt; design of the game (which will continue to evolve a better pvp
<BR>&gt; system) I think it has to do simply with the people. I had a lot
<BR>&gt; of fun authoring some of the story line in the Sundering.
<BR>&gt; (Ghuratan and Dhuratan and the begotten). I did so mostly on the
<BR>&gt; fly, and PvP could have only enhaced that, however I don’t think
<BR>&gt; it would have went as smooth as it did on the Non-PvP server.
<BR>&gt; When it comes down to the PvP server, you’ll probably find
<BR>&gt; people less concerned about role playing and more concerned
<BR>&gt; about owning their fellow man. If we don’t get past this,
<BR>&gt; everyone who really thirsts for Roleplay with either stay away
<BR>&gt; or leave.
<P>I agree this wouldn't have worked on a pvp server. In almost every guild post here, none of its about making a better experience in EQ. Its about guild power struggles and bragging rights.
<P>&gt; Everyone take responsibility for your actions and the actions of
<BR>&gt; your friends. We are the only ones that can ensure the
<BR>&gt; successful life of the PvP server and have fun doing it. There
<BR>&gt; is a perfect balance out there somewhere, I don’t know if we’ll
<BR>&gt; ever find that “perfect balance” but, I think we can come close.
<BR>&gt; As much as I like going on the Dark Elf hunts, its not enough
<BR>&gt; and should be only a fraction of what we look to for fun. We
<BR>&gt; need wars, drama, story lines and roleplaying, not just killing.
<BR>&gt; We need to kill in role rather than just in race. If you’re a
<BR>&gt; Human with Dark Elf friends and you want to hang with your
<BR>&gt; buddies (which doesn’t seem quite right in role) come up with a
<BR>&gt; story line that supports your alliance. We need to figure out
<BR>&gt; viable fixes to the problems of Lvl and Loot.
<P>Gieger I totally agree with your sentiments but really believe its a lost cause. Perhaps its time to give the pvp's their guild war platform server and concentrate on the other things mentioned by Ryan a while back. A server of pvp's by definition aren't ever going to be interested in much in grand plots and rping storylines. I certainly hope such things could make them see more depth in EQ, but I am skeptical.
<P>I think you'll find the majority of people who left the pvp in disgust are much more interest in that old militia idea or some sort of rp-pvp switch. Not so much because they fear getting killed, but is seems obvious such tools are needed to make the game resemble the EQ we all love.
<P>&gt; Its up to us.
<P>I've been flamed for it before here, I'll say it again:) The attitude of most pvps is that if "you don't like it then leave". PVP's expect everyone to conform to their powergaming style, they never once think to maybe give a little back to the game in hopes of making pvp better and maybe even something more interesting than it was in UO.Oh well with the current attitude, its becoming the same UO style of pvp and I and most have met are bored to tears with it.
<BR>&gt; Geiger the Warbringer
<P>In short I think you are preaching to the wrong crowd, but I hope you can promote some change.
<P>Chris praying for another switch option

&gt; decides my staff looks good as I am near dead from a dervish, he 
&gt; should only be able to loot if he does the normal 51%+ damage 
&gt; required in pve. Maybe not realistic but the benefits would 
&gt; outweigh the losses. This would stop a lot of the random killing 
&gt; motivate by nothing other than greed. 

&gt; Unfortunately the vast majority of the hardcore pvp's here don't 
&gt; want to play in character. In fact the vehemently complain\flame 
&gt; if anything is suggested to hinder their ability to kill whoever 
&gt; they want without ingame consequences. They keep preaching for a 
&gt; player enforced system which I doubt will work well enough to 
&gt; keep anyone but themselves playing on the server. 

&gt; Read Tarquins post, it appears some see the world of EQ as 
&gt; nothing more than xp numbers and obstacles in their way of 
&gt; dominating other players. 

&gt; I agree this wouldn't have worked on a pvp server. In almost 
&gt; every guild post here, none of its about making a better 
&gt; experience in EQ. Its about guild power struggles and bragging 
&gt; rights. 

&gt; Gieger I totally agree with your sentiments but really believe 
&gt; its a lost cause. Perhaps its time to give the pvp's their guild 
&gt; war platform server and concentrate on the other things 
&gt; mentioned by Ryan a while back. A server of pvp's by definition 
&gt; aren't ever going to be interested in much in grand plots and 
&gt; rping storylines. I certainly hope such things could make them 
&gt; see more depth in EQ, but I am skeptical. 

&gt; I think you'll find the majority of people who left the pvp in 
&gt; disgust are much more interest in that old militia idea or some 
&gt; sort of rp-pvp switch. Not so much because they fear getting 
&gt; killed, but is seems obvious such tools are needed to make the 
&gt; game resemble the EQ we all love. 

&gt; I've been flamed for it before here, I'll say it again:) The 
&gt; attitude of most pvps is that if &quot;you don't like it then 
&gt; leave&quot;. PVP's expect everyone to conform to their 
&gt; powergaming style, they never once think to maybe give a little 
&gt; back to the game in hopes of making pvp better and maybe even 
&gt; something more interesting than it was in UO.Oh well with the 
&gt; current attitude, its becoming the same UO style of pvp and I 
&gt; and most have met are bored to tears with it. 

&gt; In short I think you are preaching to the wrong crowd, but I 
&gt; hope you can promote some change.
