<P>All right, I've read through these messages, and thought I'd provide a quick look from the other side, as it were. I've only played EQ for a short time now, but my immediate reaction to the PvP server was one of disgust. PK is the main reason I stopped mudding, and I certaintly wouldn't want a repeat of the experience I had there. I was killed, repeatedly, by people many levels above me while I was simply trying to explore or gain the experience I needed to survive. Call me chicken, but that was certaintly not my idea of fun.

<P>That said, I don't mind PK, in moderation. I would LOVE to be able to worry only about RP PvP. Unfortunately, all my experience so far has shown that the people who kill out of character are usually the people who will attack the weakest targets they can.
<P>SO, I've pointedly left my switch off, and I've been glad I have (I have had several morons attempt to attack me with no provocation).
<P>Now, on to my point (yes, I do have one). For someone like me, the level limit does help somewhat. The idea of making people non-pk up until a certain level would REALLY help. I honestly can't think of any other systems that would help more - even the faction system would more than likely cause more problems than it fixed. I just want a chance to get to a point where I can fend for myself, and I don't want to be in constant fear of some idiot ruining an hour of work simply because he wants to feel better than others. As someone who is still attempting to get confortable with the movement/targeting system, I am sure I wouldn't have much chance against a determined PK. I still have problems with some of the determined monsters.. :) Give me a choice between levelling a new character in PK or NPK, and I will definately choose NPK at this point..even if I *would* enjoy the better interaction PK allows.
