<P>Well, after giving up all hope of ever seeeing my original Leoric restored on the test server, I finally started on the PvP server. Man, It sure was fun watching those Dark elfs try and muster some steam to remove us little halflings from their land. It wasnt until a corporal came that we left.(Or in my case, a "corpse"oral. I will have my revenge some day. =) ).

<P>I see PvP really shaping up, and i applaud Brad for STEALING MY IDEA OF A PVP SHARD AND CALLING IT HIS OWN IDEA AFTER HIM AND I TALKED ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES, but i'm feeling much better about that. =P
<P>Really, the games soooo much more fun with the added player interaction, and race wars. And boy is it fun to get some revenge on someone who looted yer corpse.
<P>Good job EQ staff, 989, sony, red eye, or whatever name you go by today!
<P>On to something more of a concern. I'm a phase .5er and I still see bugs in this game. Hell, I cant cast a stupid spell after running without sitting in that spot and not moving for 5 minutes (ok, 5 minutes is an exageration). But, with so much PvP code needed, and so much coding/tuning in general needed,
<P>(Heres the big question)
<P>Is the game going to be released with all of these huge issue/Bugs ALA Ultima Offline, or do the dubious thing and hold release till it's at least 95% bug free. I'm STILL going LD where other people are not, and I'm gonna tell ya, if i'm paying for the game, and i go LD, and lose some rare item, or something, I WILL GO POSTAL. If there's some PvP bug that someone uses against me, I WILL GO POSTAL.
<P>After all that, maybe this should have gone on the secure 989bugs site.
<P>Bah,
