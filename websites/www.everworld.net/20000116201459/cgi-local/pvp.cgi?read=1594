<P>After being approached in the game by several CC members who misconstrued my earlier comments, I thought I would post a clarification here. I am not "blaming" the travesty of Rallos Zek's lack of roleplaying on Covetous Crew, nor am I singling them out as the source of all bad roleplaying. I in no way meant to imply this; as I explained to the members I talked to, I had just finished having a long argument with several members of CC concerning the likelihood that PVP and Roleplaying could mix. Comments made by them simply led me to believe that their beliefs reflected those of the entire guild. At any rate, the argument was the only thing fresh in my mind when I was posting, so that's what I used as an example. The only thing that I was implying is that influential players are just that, influential. When people with as much knowledge of the game and its intracacies say stuff like "Roleplaying and PVP have never gotten along" and "Go to another server newbie bitch," then it starts to rub off on players who are uncertain of whether or not they want to remain on the PVP server, or on total newbies just coming into the online gaming community. And in case I am the only one who has noticed, I have not yet once logged into Rallos Zek when it wasn't the dead last server on the list player wise. This means, if anything goes, it goes; and it means that we are not attracting new players.

<P>In short, and to end the entire, futile discussion, I will state a simple fact: Roleplaying and PVP are not anithetical. In fact, I feel that true Roleplaying simply cannot exist without PVP, which is why I choose to stay on the PVP server despite any opposition. PVP can be roleplayed, and when it is, it is a hell of a lot more fun than "Ruling the world" by means of hard-core powergaming which just proves that you have too many hours in the day to waste...
