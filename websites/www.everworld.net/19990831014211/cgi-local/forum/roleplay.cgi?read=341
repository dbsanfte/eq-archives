<P>Spiro walks up behind his grim "friend," making as much noice as possible. In the dark elves presant state, he was likely not to be paying much attention to his sorroundings. As it was the druid didn't like the idea of being thrown overboard by a startled shadowknight, at least not untill he had restored his mana. He shuffled loudly up to Umbra's side and rested his hand on the dark elves shoulder. He talks quietly and steadily.

<P>"I know what this means to you. I remember the seen at the end of my first quest with you. Don't worry, we will catch them and get her back, but you have to remember where we are going. You had damn well better stay as inconspicuous as possible. If any of these elves see you, they will not hessitate to mob you and roast you over an open fire. If that happens, I will not be responceable for you. I will help you find the girl, but I am not going to be shunned and hated by half my blood because you want revenge. Once we find her I doubt you'll need my assistance anymore, I'm sure you can find your own way off the island, just try not to die." He watched the raging dark elf for a moment, it was very hard to tell weather or not Umbra was listening to him, or if he could even hear anything.
<P>"Oh, and when you peel off his skin; do it slowly, It's been a while since I've seen that done, and I don't want to miss the good parts." Spiro didn't even need to look at the grim one's face to know he was smiling, even if it was only on the inside. Instead he looked out accross the ocean to watch the horizon as land slowly crept along it's edges.
