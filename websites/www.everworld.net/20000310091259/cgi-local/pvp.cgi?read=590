<P>> Well seeing as how hobbes and myself were the #1 pkers in UO and

<BR>&gt; we were the ones that caused the game to change so much it would
<BR>&gt; seem a FACT that everyone that followed was a LAMER WANNABE.
<BR>&gt; Including yourself.
<P>I never said Hobbes wasnt famous in beta I said i never heard of you specifically....
<BR>and the people i just talked to about you from SiN only 1 person that was in beta even would state that you existed, Inwo Dragon from SoB:
<P><CV-> anyone heard of beta PK named WhiteWolf/Rand?
<BR><CV-> said he ran with Hobbes
<BR>[11:23] <inwo> ya, I knew him
<BR>[11:23] <inwo> he did
<BR>[11:24] <inwo> WAY back in the day
<BR>[11:24] <inwo> he did UO vault
<BR><CV-> was he a GOD he says he is :P
<BR>[11:24] <inwo> no
<BR>[11:24] <inwo> He was good in beta
<BR>[11:24] <inwo> not too hot in final
<BR><Cv-> he said he was the Ultimate UO pVP
<BR>[11:24] <inwo> he used like EVERY bug
<BR><CV-> that he was and i quote "a God"
<BR>[11:25] <inwo> bah
<P>&gt; Maybe hobbes is the only one that anyone remembers but you can
<BR>&gt; ask hobbes yourself 99% of the time he was pkilling I was right
<BR>&gt; there. And I am remembered, I went back to UO less than 2 months
<BR>&gt; ago after not playing for 6 months and had GM blacksmiths making
<BR>&gt; me free armor and giving me free weapons because even after so
<BR>&gt; long they thought I was the best player to ever grace the game
<BR>&gt; UO.
<P>LOL read above IRC clipping for more referance ahah :P
<P>&gt; Here you are being stupid. Before ANY of the SHARDS were put in
<BR>&gt; there was only 1 server and Hobbes and myself OWNED it. If you
<BR>&gt; try and dispute this you are just being stupid. So take your
<BR>&gt; wanna be ass back to UO and your SHARD.
<P>You fail to read this to its meaning I was talking Final but while youre at it almost 98% or SiN/SoB and DDH all of the GL evil alliance played beta and while some may have heard of you that wont speak up none say you or Hobbes ruled the beta shard...
<P>&gt; Oh so now I was famous? I thought noone remembered me?
<P>again you arnt getting the meaning of what i wrote I was more describing Hobbes not you.....
<BR>Hobbes is and was famous but again I say what have yall done lately not a damn thing.....
<BR>Your Uo chars if you even had them anymore would be sorely outdated these days in UO and even newbies would be able to rape you silly :P
<P>the
<BR>&gt; fact that you still play to this day tells me you are a moron. I
<BR>&gt; Hope you stay on UO because you dont seem like the type person
<BR>&gt; for EQ.
<P>well this is a fairly funny statement being that I have been playing EQ since beta 2 and to this date the close of Phase 3.5 there is Hardly any PvP + chars anywhere on the damn beta shards
<BR>I built my char for strictly PvP and there was noone to kill ever....
<BR>to this point UO is much more Skill based combat and instead of gay ass auto atatck it comes closer to player skill not Char skills.
<BR>all 200 of our guild was in Beta 1-3.5 EQ and all quit due to extreme boredom and EQs lame combat code... i sold my EQ account after 3 betas for 100k UO gold.
<P>If beta 4 gets any better and the refine PvP then mayby we will come back but until then forget it EQs weak skill system and no player skill for combat is really dumb Id rather play quake than this and to top it all off Q2 a game over a year older looks better even in SLI 1024x768 looks better than EQ does got man thats kinda bad :P
<P>&gt; I dont have my UO account anymore. I canceled it 2 days after
<BR>&gt; playing Everquest. The fact that you didnt means that you should
<BR>&gt; go back to UO and leave us true EQ'ers alone.
<P>that is the main reason I slammed your I am God statement cause i know for a fact that if you were any good you would still be knon if you were even active but the fact you quit casue you could not exploit insta kill bugs tells me youre nothing but a Fraud....
<BR>reactivate and put your money where your mouth is Mr.IamGod
<BR>Im calling you out....
<P>&gt; Wow actually stopped insulting me for a minute to talk the
<BR>&gt; truth.
<P>&gt; The fact that you stated I am remembered completely nullifies
<BR>&gt; your own statement that I am talking of forgotten deeds. Hah I
<BR>&gt; feel sorry for people like you that defeat your own statements
<BR>&gt; within the same text paragraph. hahaha lamer
<P>no comment on you lameness here I never said I rememberd you... you in that superiority complex of yours took it that way.....
<BR>CV-SiN
