<P>Chapter X by Crimson Sun

<BR>“I don’t think you’ll be going anywhere,” came a voice out of the shadows. They looked up to find themselves surrounded once again. A man with bright red hair stepped forward and approached Elenya. “We’ve been waiting for you,” he said with an evil grin.
<BR>Glodain moved to grab his sword but green arms suddenly wrapped him up in a powerful bearhug. He turned his head to see the giant orc grinning down at him. His giant yellow fangs glistened with spittle and his beady yellow eyes laughed at Glodain. Glodain sneered in disgust and turned to face the man with the red hair. Suddenly his body tensed as he remembered the face.
<BR>Elenya watched as Glodain was seized by the orc. Indecision gripped her before she remembered her slave. “Kill the orc!” she cried.
<BR>Nothing happened. The red-haired man and his troops laughed. “Kill the orc!” she cried in desperation.
<BR>“Ahhh, my dear enchantress,” the red-haired man said. “Perhaps you will think twice before kill one of my men and enslave another again. They might come back to haunt you.”
<BR>Elenya gasped and moved her hands to cast the first spell that came to mind. Halfway through the spell, her hands were grabbed by two men. She looked quickly to her left and saw the man who she had ordered killed. To her right was her slave, his neck hanging loosely to one side. “My god,” she murmured. All the mercenaries laughed especially the one with the red hair. His face wore a maniacal expression and Elenya was forced to look away.
<BR>Pigorsh watched in fear as the scene unfolded before his eyes. His body was still weak from the shadow knight’s spell, and he doubted that he could run ten yards before any of these heavily armored men caught him. He did not want to die, but maybe he could take a few of these bastards with him. What the hell, I might get lucky and take out all of them, he though. Yeah right, you damned fool, who are you trying to kid? “Well, be a hero for once in your life, Pigorsh,” the gnome wizard said to himself. Silently, but surely, he began weaving his hands to cast the most powerful spell that he knew.
<BR>That was when some idiot tapped him on the shoulder. “What in Innoruuk’s name-“ Pigorsh swore. Suddenly realizing that the words he just said were not part of the spell, Pigorsh’s face dropped. “Oh damn,” he said sullenly.
<BR>A ball of lightening exploded in the chest of the man who interrupted Pigorsh’s spell. The man died instantly and his body flew twenty feet before crashing into a tree with a resounding thud. Pigorsh fared better, but not by much. His little body flew across the clearing and landed next to E’gaile’s comatose form. Pigorsh managed to lift his head to utter one final curse, but he passed out before it could escape his lips. Then he began to snore, very loudly.
<BR>The whole group paused for several seconds before anyone acted. “Well, it seems that the problem of the gnome has been settled for us,” the shadow knight said. Again, the shadow knight laughed, but this time he laughed alone. “Well, my enchantress, we have a date with my boss. He’s paying quite well for you and I have yet to lose a bounty.”
<BR>“You!” Glodain suddenly roared. All faces in the camp turned to face the crazed elf. “I’ll kill you!” Visions of his family crying, elves he had sworn to protect dying and other elves rising from the dead flashed through Glodain’s mind. It seemed almost real. He could almost touch them. This time the shadow knight would not escape.
<BR>The shadow knight laughed. “Many have said that, but none have ever succeeded. What makes you think you can break my streak?”
<BR>Glodain stared in fury at the shadow knight. “You killed my friends and betrayed my trust. I hate you with all my soul. Not until you are dead can I return to the life I once cherished.”
<BR>“Come now, you’ll have to better than that. Why should I even waste my time with you? I am a very busy man and have no need to waste my powers on a pathetic being such as yourself.” The shadow knight turned to his men. “Hear that men? I killed his friends and betrayed his trust. How many times have you heard men say that?” Everyone laughed, but all had a shred of uneasiness in their voices. “Kill him, orc. Put that elf out of his misery.”
<BR>“I challenge you to a duel, Crimson Sun!” Glodain cried.
<BR>The shadow knight turned and stared at the elf with a look of surprise on his face. “What did you say, elf?”
<BR>“A duel! You hear me, you spawn of Cazic-Thule!”
<BR>Crimson stared at the elf with a newfound respect. “How do you know my name, elf?”
<BR>“A duel, Crimson Sun! I challenge you to a duel!”
<BR>Crimson stared at the elf for a minute before responding. “Release him, orc.” Shocked, the orc simply stood still. “Release him I said. Or do you wish to die in his place?” Quickly, the orc released him and Glodain drew his sword. “Very well, elf. You have earned the right to die by my blade. Let me warn you, it’s not much of an honor, as the many how have earned it can tell you.”
<BR>Glodain glared at the shadow knight, without hearing a single word he said, and charged. With a fury unknown to all but a few, he brought his blade down with a vengeance. However, Crimson was easily able to raise his own blade to parry it. Again, Glodain swung and again Crimson parried it.
<BR>The duel continued for several minutes with Glodain always on the offensive and Crimson parrying every blow. “He’s toying with him,” Elenya said with tears running down her face. She knew what the outcome of this fight would be.
<BR>If Glodain had been healthy, he might have stood a chance. Even then, he was the lesser of the two warriors. But bloodied and beaten as he was, he served as only a minor nuisance to the shadow knight. “I tire of this game, elf,” Crimson said after blocking another of Glodain’s swings. “It ends now.” With a speed that amazed all assembled, Crimson swung his sword and foot at the same time. His blade connected with the hilt of Glodain’s sword and sent it flying. Crimson’s foot caught the back of Glodain’s knee and the elf collapsed to his knees.
<BR>“My family, I have failed,” Glodain said will looking the shadow knight in the eye. He would not show weakness, even at the time of his death.
<BR>Crimson grabbed the shirt of the elf with his left hand and raised his sword for the killing blow. Then their eyes met and the killing blow was stayed. “I remember you,” the shadow knight said. With his left hand he ripped Glodain’s shirt open and saw what he thought he would see. “Fool!” he cried. “I spared your life once already. I shall not grant you mercy a second time.” Again the sword was raised for the killing blow.
<BR>Crimson shut his eyes. Glodain smiled. Even in death, I am the stronger, he thought.
<BR>Without warning, Crimson’s eyes flashed open with a maniacal look. Remember your vow, a voice said within his head. “I remember,” Crimson whispered. His eyes became sane again and he glared with pure hatred at the fallen elf. “Amnesty is yours again, elf,” Crimson murmured. With those words, Crimson brought his sword down and cracked the pommel of sword against the elf’s head.
<BR>“Nooooooo!” Elenya screamed as Glodain collapsed with all the grace of a dead bird.
<BR>Crimson’s men stared in shock at their leader. Never before had they seen their boss do that.
<BR>Crimson looked up at this men. “Come on. We still have to collect the bounty on the enchantress’s head.”
<BR>His men stood still for a second. “What about the others. Should we-“
<BR>“Leave them be. They’ll die soon enough. Move!” Crimson turned began marching off into he woods. Still shocked by the whole situation, his men followed, dragging Elenya with them.
<BR>E’gaile woke from her sleep just as the last of the mercenaries was leaving. Her head hurt and her vision was swimming before her eyes. E’gaile put her hand to her hand and felt the bandage wrapped around it. “Strange,” she said, “where did this come from?” Not to be bothered by minor details, she shook her head to try and clear her vision.
<BR>Finally regaining some sense of her bearings, she saw the unconscious form of Pigorsh next to him. “Oh, dear Erollisi, he’s dead,” she said. Then she realized that he was snoring. Smiling at her mistake, E’gaile looked around the camp. Then her eyes fell upon Glodain’s unmoving body.
<BR>“Glodain!” she cried and rose unsteadily to her feet.
<BR>As fast as she could, E’gaile ran over to Glodain. She turned him over and saw that his brow was bleeding severely. He was also muttering something over and over. It sounded like “Forgive me.”
<BR>“Glodain, it’s me. Can you hear me?”
<BR>“Ardenna, is that you, my sister?”
<BR>“No, Glodain, its me, E’gaile,” the elven mage whispered, with tears streaming down her face.
<BR>“Ardenna, please do not play games, I don’t have much time. Ardenna,” he said before pausing. Several seconds passed before he spoke again. “Ardenna, tell Arwyn I love her and always have loved her. Tell her I miss her. Please, Ardenna, tell her.”
<BR>Before E’gaile could respond, Glodain’s body went limp. He was still breathing, but his breath was shallow at best. E’gaile tried to stifle her sobs and looked down. She could see a holy symbol of Erollisi Marr on his exposed chest. Grief then overcame her and she buried her face in her hands.
<BR>Pigorsh woke up shaking his head. “Bah, girl! With all that friggin’ crying, how is one supposed to get any sleep?” Pigorsh then remembered what had happened and felt himself to make sure he was still alive. Assured that he was he uttered a sigh of relief. “Oi! That was one hell of a spell.” Pigorsh then looked to his side and saw that a strange-looking object had fallen from his backpack. “Hello? What do we have here?” the curious gnome said while grasping the object.
<BR>Before he had a chance to experiment with it, the sound of horses’ hooves resounded through the forest. Within seconds, five elves on horseback burst into the clearing. Four were heavily armored and their leader wore elegant clothes. A white cloak billowed from his back.
<BR>“Who the ‘ell are you?” Pigorsh said with his customary courtesy.
