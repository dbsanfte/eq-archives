</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> First:

<BR>&gt; Caster types have a number of huge advantages in PvP situations,
<BR>&gt; now since there is generally no exp loss from pvp caster types
<BR>&gt; have almost nothing to lose as there spells are just as
<BR>&gt; effective without their equipment I have been atatcked too many
<BR>&gt; times by casters with absoultly no equipment on them or it all
<BR>&gt; bagged as they pk! This is silly and allows them to attack any
<BR>&gt; pure melee class without any fear of losing anything. At later
<BR>&gt; levels melee classes can lose a lot like a steel breastplate or
<BR>&gt; something 1000 plat!. Wizards lose nothing what I proprose is
<BR>&gt; that if a wizard gets pk'ed there is always the option of
<BR>&gt; stealing his spellbook, but not all of it only his highest
<BR>&gt; ranking spells will be lost, which the character can sell them
<BR>&gt; for a fairly good price at vendors or to players. It may sound
<BR>&gt; like a lot but its not too bad, and is still less than what a
<BR>&gt; warrior can lose since warrior equipment is usually worth more
<BR>&gt; but its at least comparable. 7 spells at 22 plat each is only
<BR>&gt; about 150 plat, at least its something that they can always
<BR>&gt; lose, and it will cost them money and time to replace that just
<BR>&gt; like it would a warrior if a warrior lost an item.
<BR>&gt; Second:
<BR>&gt; Wizards also can pk with relative safety, and if teh battle does
<BR>&gt; go wrong can usually just gate, or a favorite, shadowstep (
<BR>&gt; almost no casting time, so its hard to interrupt) and gate.
<BR>&gt; Thats crazy too before I talked about WHEN they die, but to a
<BR>&gt; decent wizard pk, not even a good one that happens rarely.
<BR>&gt; Although gateing is a low level spell people should remeber it
<BR>&gt; is also a very powerful spell allowing one to teleport to other
<BR>&gt; continents. Such a powerful spell should take time simialr to
<BR>&gt; camping, alhtough I in no way suggest it take 30 seconds. But
<BR>&gt; the casting time should be longer and shoudl definitly not be
<BR>&gt; shorter than the roundtime of my swing! cause thats crazy then I
<BR>&gt; have NO chance to stop him.
<BR>&gt; For all those that think that this will unbalance a wizard think
<BR>&gt; again at my level (20) they can already destroy me in a few
<BR>&gt; hits( they can do 171) and that only goes up as casters become
<BR>&gt; more damage/mana efficient. They would still be the most
<BR>&gt; powerful class it would just grant some a chance to fight back.
<BR>&gt; And if you respond negaltivly to this post please be sure its
<BR>&gt; not because you do not want your wizard character to lose his
<BR>&gt; great perks.
<P>&gt; -Ghouldan Shadowknight
<P>OK listen pal, it is fairly obvious that you odnt know anyhtign about wizards what so ever. Have you any idea how hard it is to lvl ?. and this form a shadow knigh thwo can lvl so quik. A wiz cant solo has no life. it is also extremely difficult to lvl at dungeons like the rest of you can. we dotn have SOW. We have almost no hps and YES ROOT SUX. you must have no idea what your tlakign about. and whats with this at lvl 20 they can do 170 dmg. hrmm let me see that spell your tlaking about (force shock) is resisted A LOT and taes up alot of mana and then at lvl 24 you thin our damamge spell does more dmg ? um no it onyl does 170 jsut doesnt mis sliek force shock does. IT is extremely easy for a a tank type to interupt spells in pvp and such spells like shadow step and fade are essential for survival. as far as gate you can only gate to where you are bound. Unless you decide to have oen of your other gate spells memorized which isnt likey and yes they take longer to cast. Im lvl 30 and can only gate with relative speed which is still slow to a few locations like toxx and north gate. All the other places i can gate to are portal spells which is group gate and take about 20 seconds to cast. Ill also have you know getting money is hard for a wiz also. A because it is easy for su to die. and B because most of the time we are forced to group and it is split between everyone and gettign any type of item doesnt come aroudn that often. and certainly one that is any good. at lvl 30 i only do 240 dmg i have dueled trol tank that was very close to my lvl and he slaughtered me. And no it isnt just because i suck. blah. By the tiem you get higher lvl im sure you will have JBOOTs so we wont be able to root you. But heck root sux anyway and no you cant jsut solo all over the place with it like soem of oyu think. It makes me mad that soem ppl say stuff like wizards have it easy because it just simply isnt true. Go get a clue man. I challenge you to make awizard and well see how long you last before you dump it P
