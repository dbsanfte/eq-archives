<P>Chapter IV by Thorvard

<BR>Elenya was lying on the path, staring death in the face. She had been out horseback riding, when suddenly, a snake had spooked her horse and she was thrown from the saddle. As she lay on the ground catching her breath the snake coiled, ready to strike. Calmly, she made a few gestures and chanted a few words in an arcane tongue. The snake slithered off, no longer taking any notice of the Elf maiden lying on the ground. Being an enchantress had its advantages.
<BR>She slowly lifted herself off the ground and brushed off her clothing. She looked around for her mount, but she was nowhere to be seen. “Blasted horse,” she muttered. “Now I will be late getting back to my uncle’s house. Uncle Taurmon is going to be furious!” She had only been to Faydwer a few weeks, visiting her Mothers kin. They hadn’t liked the idea of her riding off alone to explore the woods, but she had ridden off before her uncle could change his mind.
<BR>“Oh well,” she sighed. “I guess I better go face the music.” She started off down the path. Already it was growing dark, she had ridden over long, and now it would taker her hours to walk the rest of the way home. It would be well after midnight before she arrived.
<BR>She had been walking along for some time when she first heard it. There was a clash of steel and shouting. Someone was fighting! She started off in the direction of the battle, when suddenly, the ground began to tremble and a great geyser of fire erupted. It was some distance ahead, a little ways off of the main path. “Oh my!” she exclaimed, and quickened her pace.
<BR>The sounds of battle soon faded and the flames had gone out, she was mighty curious as to what was happening. The stench of charred flesh soon filled her nostrils; she was very close now. As she peered out from behind a tree she saw a man with bright red hair shouting orders to a group of rather well armed ruffians. She saw the objects of his wrath, 2 elves and a gnome, laying helpless on the scorched earth of the clearing.
<BR>As she pondered her next move the man with the red hair barked out a few more orders and marched off, taking the majority of his men with him. She had to act quickly now, as the two men that were left behind began to approach the helpless elves, knives in hand. With a spell already on her lips she stepped out from behind the tree.
<BR>“I’m gonna enjoy this, Borri,” said one of the ruffians to his partner. “You take care of that ugly little bugger, I’ll take care of the other one.”
<BR>“Right, Drudder,” snorted the other mercenary. “Then we can have a little sport with the wench.”
<BR>“Who’re you callin’ ugly?” Pigorsh retorted feebly “It looks like you got beat with a friggin’ ugly stick.”
<BR>“Yer gonna pay fer that, you little runt.” growled Borri. As he advanced on the hapless gnome he saw a figure step out of the woods. It was the one they were looking for. “Hey, Drudder!” he shouted. “It’s her!”
<BR>“What?” replied the other, looking up. He had Glodain by the hair stretching his neck for the cut. “That’s her! Grab her!” He rushed over towards his partner, forgetting the elf in his haste.
<BR>“Grab her I says!” Drudder shouted again. His partner just stood there as if in a trance.
<BR>“He can’t hear you right now,” Elenya informed him. “I think you had better drop your weapon.”
<BR>He looked to his partner; he just stood there with a dazed look about him. And her just standing there, unarmed, with a smug look on her face. “Like hell I will,” he growled, and rushed her. He had taken only a few steps when his partner lashed out and planted his knife in his back. His body suddenly went numb and he sank to the ground. The last thing he saw was his own blood, pooling beneath him.
<BR>“That was a nice piece o’ work...” cackled the gnome. “Fer a female. Help me up, will ya lady? I’m a little dizzy.”
<BR>“Follow me,” Elenya ordered the now compliant mercenary, as she approached the stricken gnome. Borri followed her without hesitation.
<BR>“What happened here?” she asked the gnome as she helped him to his feet.
<BR>“What happened?!” exclaimed Pigorsh. “I’ll tell you what happened! We was attacked, that’s what happened!”
<BR>Elenya rolled her eyes. Gnomes always had to be so difficult. “I can see that you were attacked,” she replied. “I have eyes you know. I just want to know why you were attacked.”
<BR>The little gnome eyed her closely. What he saw was a young elf maiden with long, flowing blonde hair. She was dressed for riding but he saw no horse. “You’re an enchanter are you?” he asked.
<BR>“An enchantress. Yes I am,” she replied. “What has that got to do with anything?”
<BR>“Well excuse me, an enchantress she says! Well let me tell ya, dearie,” he said, glaring up at her. “Those clowns were lookin’ fer an enchantress. “
<BR>They were suddenly interrupted by someone moaning a few feet away. It was Glodain struggling to get to his feet.
<BR>“Make yerself useful why don’t ya,” grunted the gnome. “Go over and have a look at the girl. I’ll see to my friend here.”
<BR>They made their way over to the two elves. Pigorsh helped Glodain to his feet. “Yer gettin’ soft.” he muttered, “How could you let an orc knock you senseless?”
<BR>Glodain stood there a moment a little unsteady on his feet. “It wasn’t that difficult,” he muttered, trying to clear the cobwebs out of his skull. He had one whopper of a headache. “E’gaile doesn’t have much aim with her spells.” He was suddenly aware of Elenya, who was now examining E’gaile. “Who is that?”
<BR>“That, my friend,” Pigorsh replied, “Is the one that saved your sorry behind, uhh... I didn’t catch her name, and that,” He motioned to the now motionless Borri. “Is her pet goon”
<BR>Glodain glanced over at the mercenary; he recognized the dazed look of someone under a spell. “An enchantress, are you?” he asked her.
<BR>“That’s right.” Elenya stood up and looked at Glodain. “Greetings,” she said. “My name is Elenya, I’m glad to be of assistance.”
<BR>“Well, we certainly are in your debt,” replied Glodain, looking her over. “I am Glodain, the girl there is named E’gaile, will she be alright?”
<BR>“She took a hard blow to the head,” she replied. “But I think she will be fine.” She knelt down next to E’gaile and finished securing a bandage to the young elf maidens head.
<BR>“Alright, alright,” Pigorsh broke in. “enough with the small talk already! We better be gettin’ outta here before those goons come back.”
<BR>“I don’t think you’ll be going anywhere,” came a voice out of the shadows. They looked up to find themselves surrounded once again. A man with bright red hair stepped forward and approached Elenya. “We’ve been waiting for you,” he said with an evil grin.
