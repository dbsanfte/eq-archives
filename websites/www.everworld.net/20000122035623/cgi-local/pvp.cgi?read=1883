<P>You're incorrect on a very pivotal point, the game is NOT divided so simply into two camps. I don't know why people have made this division and think it is or should be hard-coded, because nothing in the EverQuest history or manual suggests that it should be so. There are good races, High-Elves, Erudites, Dwarves, etc. There are evil races, Trolls, Dark-Elves, Ogres. However, there are races which have no real definition, most namely Gnomes, Halflings, Barbarians and Humans. There are human necromancers, you think they should fight on the side of "good"? People make these divions in their heads and then expect them to apply to the game. "You're a human, why are you killing a halfling, he's another good race!" BS. Halfling rogues, human necromancers, and Barbarian warriors can be just as evil as the evilest of the dark-elves.

<P>I do agree with you on one point, though. Faction hits for murdering your own race should be downright crippling. Three or four same race kills should ban you from your hometown for a great stretch. However, there is one thing you overlooked. Killing members of your own race and destroying your faction in one city, should subsequently raise it in another. Being banned from Qeynos for killing humans should mean you are welcome in Neriak. The "Turncoat" or "Traitor" factor MUST be left in the game, same-race murderers cannot just be ousted into the wilderness with nowhere to go and nothing to do. It should be possible, however, for a heretofor "good" player to become "evil" by simaltaneously decreasing his faction in one city state and thus increasing it in another.
