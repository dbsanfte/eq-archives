</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> Alright, I posted this below to some guy who made a really dumb

<BR>&gt; suggestion for looting. I think this needs to be
<BR>&gt; clarified for everyone who plays on Rallos:
<P>&gt; "IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT, GET THE F^CK OUTTA THE
<BR>&gt; KITCHEN"
<P>&gt; where you won't have to change the world to fit YOUR style of
<BR>&gt; playing and
<BR>&gt; make EVERYONE ELSE unhappy.
<P>&gt; 'How to fix the system': Well, in this case it can't really be
<BR>&gt; fixed, because this is how most PKing works
<BR>&gt; (I've done hard core PK'ing in two other very popular online
<BR>&gt; games - UO and Diablo - for the past 3 years or so).
<BR>&gt; You wait until someone is vulnerable, then you wax them.
<P>&gt; It just happens that spellcasters are best for this job, so they
<BR>&gt; are always the ones who get jumped on for being "too
<BR>&gt; powerful." Realize that it is just as easy for a Cleric to
<BR>&gt; Root or Blind a caster while he is fighting a monster and then
<BR>&gt; wait until the monster has the caster down to low health.
<BR>&gt; Realize that ANY class except for Warriors (well Warriors CAN
<BR>&gt; use Archery to chase down and kill someone low on health) can do
<BR>&gt; this, by various means. Also realize that you are playing in a
<BR>&gt; cutthroat society,
<BR>&gt; where you MAY get killed at any point.
<P>&gt; *** IF YOU WANT TO NOT BE ATTACKED WHILE VULNERABLE OR FIGHTING
<BR>&gt; A MOB THEN *DO NOT* I REPEAT *DO NOT* PLAY ON RALLOS ZEK. IT IS
<BR>&gt; THE FATE OF EVERYONE TO DIE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREER ON
<BR>&gt; THIS SERVER TO THIS SORT OF THING. IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. IT HAS
<BR>&gt; HAPPEND TO MY FRIENDS - IT *WILL* HAPPEN TO YOU. ***
<P>&gt; It also has happened in every single online game I've ever
<BR>&gt; played - just like it happens in real life. when do thugs attack
<BR>&gt; you? when you are in a dark alley, alone, and when they have
<BR>&gt; superior numbers. DO you go out in the night with expensive
<BR>&gt; clothing and $10,000 in your pocket into a KNOWN dangerous
<BR>&gt; neighborhood or situation (dark alley)? DO YOU? are you really
<BR>&gt; that stupid? well think the same while playing on Rallos Zek.
<BR>&gt; don't get your ass into tight situations (fighting multiple mobs
<BR>&gt; alone in a dungeon or with a weak/small group with no healer),
<BR>&gt; and ALWAYS, ALWAYS be looking around you. circle the monster you
<BR>&gt; are
<BR>&gt; fighting while you fight it so you can get a view all around
<BR>&gt; you. THAT is how you survive on this server - by playing it
<BR>&gt; smart,
<BR>&gt; *NOT* by petitioning Verant to change the entire game just so
<BR>&gt; you don't have to ever die or ever feel uncomfortable.
<P>&gt; So just exactly WHO is making the petitioning, whining, and
<BR>&gt; bitching? Twinkers, newbies, and morons. The three types of
<BR>&gt; people that don't belong on Rallos Zek. That's all I have to
<BR>&gt; say. Read the top of this post for clarification.
<P>While I agree with most of what you said, I don't agree with the part about "Newbies" not belonging on Rallos Zek. I have just started playing EQ and want the thrill and adrenaline rush of trying to stay alive. The best place to achieve this is playing on a PK Server. This is not a FLAME it's only for other NEWBIES who want the thrill to keep their mouth shut and suck it up when they die.
