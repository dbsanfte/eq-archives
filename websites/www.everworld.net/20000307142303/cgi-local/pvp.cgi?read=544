<P>A lot of people will have a hard time losing 1 bubble of exp from dying. And also the one item loot is major, many people may think that 1 item is not enough but once they play it they will realize that 1 item loss is GIANT and they wont want all items. Unless you have a friend of pvp+ people you will have a hard time grouping because no one will be able to heal/buff you and you cant heal/buff them so people want to stay pvp- so they can group. I believe that more people would pvp if there was no exp loss and loot loss.. i know everyone would hate that idea of no looting(oh my!) and that verant would never go for it becuase they want death to have some meaning. Maybe have temporarily lose skills like 10% on death and after one eq day(1.5 hours) you will regain full skills back. That would make people still able to compete( if a warrior loses his weapon is he up the creek unless he has a few good ones, but after a while he will be reduced to nothing but a newbie weapon), and there is penalties on death which might make Verant happy...

<P>Comments, ?
<P>Tempra[CC]
<P>&gt; Reading through most of the messages below I have seen some
<BR>&gt; excellent
<BR>&gt; comments on PVP. Here is one observation that I think might be
<BR>&gt; food for thought for the Everquest PVP community.
<P>&gt; First, I, and I think most in the -PVP community could heartily
<BR>&gt; support many of the ideas expressed by posters on this message
<BR>&gt; board.
<BR>&gt; While I realize that I do not speak for the whole -PVP
<BR>&gt; community,I think most would have no problem with one or several
<BR>&gt; + PVP servers
<BR>&gt; Nor would I object to changing process of PVP from level based
<BR>&gt; to skill based combat.
<P>&gt; I firmly believe that anything that will increase
<BR>&gt; your enjoyment of the Everquest experience, without diminishing
<BR>&gt; my own, is something that I would not only not oppose, but
<BR>&gt; actively promote.
<P>&gt; Where you lose me and many other -PVP players is when you
<BR>&gt; suggest things like PVP zones where any player, including -PVP
<BR>&gt; players would be, even if only temporarily, forced to play as
<BR>&gt; +PVP. Many of us feel very strongly that we chose -PVP and
<BR>&gt; should not be forced into any other style of game play against
<BR>&gt; our will.
<P>&gt; What the typical -PVP player will say about these type of
<BR>&gt; suggestions is, "see, they just want to force us to play
<BR>&gt; the game their way," and resist any suggestions of changes
<BR>&gt; to the game made by the +PVP community. They see that letting
<BR>&gt; +PVP players get their foot in the door will ultimately mean the
<BR>&gt; end of the -PVP community. Whether this is true or not, it is
<BR>&gt; the perception that exists.
<P>&gt; If, as one of your posters said, over 80 percent of the beta
<BR>&gt; testers play with the switch set to -PVP, it is a fair
<BR>&gt; assumption that by far the majority of players will be -PVP
<BR>&gt; players when the game is in public release. Business is the
<BR>&gt; ultimate democracy. The faction of customers that represent the
<BR>&gt; most money always wins.
<P>&gt; The simple fact of the matters is, you need us more than we need
<BR>&gt; you.
<BR>&gt; You need us to support your ideas and suggestions for improving
<BR>&gt; the game for the +PVP community, and you need us to actively
<BR>&gt; endorse those
<BR>&gt; ideas with Sony and its subsidiary companies.
<P>&gt; When ever you make a suggestion to improve +PVP game play, ask
<BR>&gt; two questions. First, how will this suggestion affect -PVP
<BR>&gt; players and secondly, how will they see it affecting them.
<P>&gt; As a united online community of Everquest players, we can help
<BR>&gt; Verdent make this the best possible game for all of us. If we
<BR>&gt; are two
<BR>&gt; warring camps, the PVP community may win some battles but they
<BR>&gt; will ultimately lose the war.
