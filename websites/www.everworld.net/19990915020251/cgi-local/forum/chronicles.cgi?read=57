<P>The one who called himself 'The Master' paced back and forth beside E'Gaile's lifeless body. She had not taken a breath since he heard her curse and hour ago, "Damn." She had used an odd accent though: Sounded like, "Dain," but that made no sense whatsoever. The Master leaned over the wood elf's empty gaze. How long could her body stay dead before he would lose her completely? He touched her shoulder and felt the chill of death on her. Gods, she was beautiful like that. Her hair was splayed back across the cold earth. The color was gone from her cheeks and her skin ... her skin was maginificant! So smooth and cold. She was not the one he had chosen for his own, but she would make an exceptional concubine whether she lived through this exercise or not. He took her hand in his and was about to apply its coolness to the heat of his loins when he noticed that she was stiffening. He sighed. This was not the time or place for this. She would be his soon enough. For now, he needed word of Miragul.

<P>The Master took the orb down from its resting place in mid-air over E'Gail's face. He expected her to stir. She did not. He shook her shoulders, but got no responce. The Master stood and cast his favorite spell on the girl. She might still be dead, but he would be able to speak with her and get all he wanted from her. The spell went as normal and he expected her to rise up presently, but she did not. She was suddenly screaming, filling the night with the sound of death itself. And lying atop her was an elven man. The two of them were clinging to each other in a tight embrace.
<P>The man jumped up and turned to face this self-proclaimed Master. Dain looked as he had when he and E'Gaile set out on their travels that last morning. He was fresh and handsome. No sign of the brief chase and battle that occured on that last day were evident.
<P>Dain faced his opponent with reagent pouches full and spells at the ready.
