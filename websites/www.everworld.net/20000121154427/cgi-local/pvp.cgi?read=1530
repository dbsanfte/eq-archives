</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> A few problems I obseved that still remain:

<P>&gt; #1 You are in a group fighting a monster. One of your team mates
<BR>&gt; needs healing and you target them to cast a spell and WHACK you
<BR>&gt; hit them because you are in auto-attack mode and all of you are
<BR>&gt; RED. Members of the same group should not be able to hit one
<BR>&gt; another or damage each other with spells.
<P>I doubt this will be corrected. It is seen as a way of keeping you on your toes in battle. You have to remember to hit "a" before targeting another member of your group for healing or buffing, and then hit "a" again when you go back to your target. I agree with you, but I doubt Verant will because it's too easily explainable and avoidable to be fixed.
<P>&gt; #2 If you use a racial hiding skill you cannot tell if you have
<BR>&gt; succeeded. Your character dissapears from your own point of
<BR>&gt; view, but observers may or may not see you. I noticed that with
<BR>&gt; four of us trying hiding, at one point I could see character B
<BR>&gt; but another player could not see character B, so hiding is also
<BR>&gt; relative to each individual. I would prefer if hiding was either
<BR>&gt; success or failure, and that you knew whether or not you had
<BR>&gt; succeeded. Otherwise the skill is only of use as a curioisity as
<BR>&gt; I won't stake my life on using it. At the very least if another
<BR>&gt; player obsevers me hide successfully, then other players that
<BR>&gt; happen across me should not be able to see me.
<P>This I completely disagree with you on. When you hide, you are not sure if you are hidden well enough to conceal your body from everyone. You might THINK you are hidden, but others around you might be able to detect you. As for the ability to spot hidden players, this SHOULD be dependent on observer. Some people are just more acute, more able to spot things, more observant, etc. You should make a roll to see if you can spot a hidden player.
<P>As for your willingness to stake your life on it, that should be dependent on your skill level. If you have a 50% skill level, you know you will succeed half the time. That's a gamble, but if you're running from 10 guys, it's a gamble you might take. If your skill is an 80 or 90, I'd stake my life on that any time.
<P>&gt; #3 The guards in Mysty Thcket still get stuck back in the tunnel
<BR>&gt; leading to Rivervale on a regular basis, leaving the newbies in
<BR>&gt; the zone to fend for themselves.
<P>&gt; #4 Red PvP players that die to a mob are still lootable by other
<BR>&gt; players, even though you receive a message that you cannot loot
<BR>&gt; this player, you are still able to remove an item from their
<BR>&gt; inventory as well as all of their coins. This looting condition
<BR>&gt; should only be in effect when another red PvP player has done a
<BR>&gt; majority of the overall damage to that player.
<P>Agree here. Looting is a serious problem. CC, or should I say "THE Guild to fear on the PVP server," just loves hanging around until they can get their hands on some free armor or some gold.
