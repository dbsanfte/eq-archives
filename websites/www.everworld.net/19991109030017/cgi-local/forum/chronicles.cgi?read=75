<P>Well "Dark Fate" was earlier in my bio, now here is later. I dont have the story in beween done, but may someday.

<P>The End and the Beginning
<BR>Part 1
<P>It had just got dark , he was in the middle of the forest and he had just killed two people and he couldn't even remember why. Then he picked up his sword, he deeply looked into the blade and he saw the blood of all the people he killed and then he saw and felt the pain in his life that the killing immuned. He was killing his own life not knowing who or what he was. He needed something else, he needed a reason.Then in the middle of the night a bright star shone and reflected off his sword , he was nearly blinded. Then his heart spoke to him and he knew what he needed to do! He needed to start a knew reputation, a new reason, a new life. Then he heard horses and someone said "We're gonna get you back Alandros!" He knew their was at least three of them, he would have no chance against three or more of them. He also knew they would never forgive him, or believe that he had started a new life. A life not of barbarism like his old life, that they knew. He couldn't outrun horses, he couldn't hide (because the sun was rising and it would reflect off his armor) . He had nowhere to go , nowhere to hide , he finally felt what his victims felt like before he killed them. He estimated that it would take about five minutes for them to reach him . What could he do!
<P>Part 2
<P>He had to think clearly, but that was not possible under the circumstances. How could he take down 3 men on horses by himself. He had nowhere to go, their was one option .To surrender ! Alandros screamed"I surrender ,I give my life to you for taking your friends life".The man leading the men (Garet) said"Ha..you think I'll spare you after what you did, you killed my best friend, now I shall rip you apart.".Alandros replied by saying "I have been evil, but I have decided to change, to start over. But I cant start over unless I live, I beg you, I will give you anything of mine you want. Just let me live! "Garet said "Never, you're a murder and you shall be killed by my sword. "Alandros noticed it has been about 3-4 minutes, they'll be here any moment. I am surely dead Alandros thought to himself. Alandros knew what he had to do, Alandros screamed "Rodcet Nife I vow my life and service to you, to heal and protect as a Paladin, I shall learn the ways of a Paladin, I just need to live. I beg you god of healing, help me at this moment and I vow the rest of my life to you" ....Far in the distance a paladin was called to defend Alandros by Mathaniel Marr. But the Paladin was far away, with the power of Marr he rode like the wind. Meanwhile, Garet and his men were getting close, too close. Then Garet's and Alandros's eyes met. Alandros's eyes were struck with fear, and Garet's eyes were struck with bloodthirsty rage. Garet said "HA, see how your god Marr protected you. Now its my turn for revenge. And then when Alandros' hope and Garets stuborn assumtions where at their height, all of a sudden a noise of a horse cam out of nowhere. It was the paladin. The paladin pulled his sword out and struck the man closest to Garet, the man died instantly, the paladin did a perfect hit to the man's throat. Then the paladin leaped off his horse and knocked the other man (but not Garet) and the paladin fought the guy in a hand to hand fight! Now the only threat left to Alandros was Garet. Garet was still struck with rage and swung his axe at Alandros. Alandros quickly ducked. The axe flew over Alandros's head and then Alandros pulled out his sword and said "I give you the chance you didn't give me, either you go now or I will fight you, and the fight will result in your death." Garet said "Never, you will pay for your actions" then Garet charged towards Alandros and swung his axe vertically and Alandros moved quickly to the left and struck his sword at Garet's face. Garet fell to the ground and died before he hit the ground. The paladin had knocked the other guy unconscious the Paladin spoke to Alandros and said "Marr sent me to help you, and I shall adventure with you and teach you the ways of the Paladin, but I myself am a beginner as a Paladin so I cannot teach you beyond the basics. Now lets get out of here before any more people come" . Alandros and the paladin rode on horses out of the forest and while riding the Paldain said "My name is Malion and I belevie yours is Alandros?", Alandros replied "Yes ,I am Alandros, and thanks for saving me back their ". Malion said "I was told to by Marr, so I had no choice but to save the life of a former killer. Alandros said"Wait, I have given up that life, Please let me keep it in the past. Where are we headed?" Marion said "We shall go to Highpass Hold."
<P>Please tell me what you think.
