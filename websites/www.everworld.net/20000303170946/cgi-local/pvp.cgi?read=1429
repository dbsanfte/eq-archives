<P>> EverQuest is classified as a Role-Playing game. That's what it

<BR>&gt; was designed for. The PvP server was made for another aspect of
<BR>&gt; 'role-playing', not for little juveniles to go around killing
<BR>&gt; others for the fun of it. That's not fun, that's powergaming,
<BR>&gt; and that's what we don't want, and what will bring down the
<BR>&gt; server if it's continued.
<P>Yes it is fun, you tell me who doesn't like having guild wars? revenge and hunting down and such... maybe to you who is always that kid that gets beaten up...but that is where YOU lack your roleplaying skills. Ask a fellow group of adventurers to help you oppose such murder attempt by a pk... Don't start accusing powergaming, that has nothing to do with it.
<P>&gt; You are exactly like all of the other little kids who kill other
<BR>&gt; players for the joy of making someone's life misereable. That's
<BR>&gt; your idea of fun, and too tell you the truth, it makes me sick.
<BR>&gt; It may be fun for you to go pk your own race, or what have you,
<BR>&gt; but it's not fun for the person you kill. Granted, it is a PK
<BR>&gt; server, but it's supposed to be done in moderation and in the
<BR>&gt; aspect of roleplaying.
<P>God, you people are all biased, you think that everyone who likes to have personal freedom which is backed up by constitution is some small kid that likes to play quake...
<P>I am sure if you asked people I fought if I made their life miserable... you are wrong, ask them I am sure they I made it more interesting because we fight all the time and its fun for them and me, and they will admit it. I am not goign around killing em over and over and over, no its clean fights and its FUN. I feel sorry for you that you can't see that other people can have fun in other ways.
<P>Yes, its a PK extension server to EQ RPG.. I know this and I do roleplay a lot, but I am saying that people should NOT be forced to roleplay. I want to kill a gnome who pisses me off, I DO NOT want to have to think about some GM coming and trying to brainwash me.
<P>&gt; You say 500 people are happy with the way it is? Well the
<BR>&gt; majority of that 500 were roleplayers. I know, i've been there,
<BR>&gt; and the other small amount made it hell for those people who
<BR>&gt; tried to have a good time. People like you make it hell for the
<BR>&gt; majority who sign on to play a character and enjoy the game. If
<BR>&gt; this is your attitude, don't play EQ. No one will want you
<BR>&gt; there.
<P>Haha, god you are so biased. Tried to have good time? what you mean with this? Majority of people I had PVP fights had fun during fights and it was cool. For those that it wasn't, too bad, get a friend and try revenge, I know that makes you feel very good. This is what keeps the game interesting. I dont want to fight stupid AI monsters, which seem pretty smart but thats nothign compared to interaction between players. I want to have people hunt me, I like playing as an outcast, an evil necromancer who kills all life. I am roleplaying thatswhy I picked necromancer, and by my god I follow, I kill all living things. If you want more roleplaying that this, I will not do.
<P>And btw don't tell me what to do.
