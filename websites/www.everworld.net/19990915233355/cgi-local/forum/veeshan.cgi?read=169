<P>Halas Conclave - LOA Expeditionary force – Day 1

<P><font size="2" face="verdana, arial">Posted by Hakadek on June 10, 1999 at 06:40:24 on our Conclave Forum:<blockquote>Halas Conclave - LOA Expeditionary force – Day 1<p>After arriving foot sore and weary in Halas, many LOA members went off to rest and recuperate. After doing likewise, I returned to the snowy valleys around Halas in an attempt to find out more about the Permafrost dungeon that was likely to be the focus of attention during the Conclave.<p>As none of our number seemed to know its location I set about exploring the area. Soon after locating a way out of the valleys into a wide open, wind swept expanse of snow I received word that one of our petitioners, Yabbernox, needed guidance on the last stage of his long journey from the Dwarven home land of Kaladim. After leading him the last few steps of the journey he bravely volunteered to join in the hunt for Permafrost. Bojo had by this time awoken, and also seemed keen for adventure, so together we set out into the great unknown.<p>Following rumours that I had heard, we began heading due east across the snow plains. The plentiful polar bears seemed to pay us little attention and the sighting of the occasional spider and wild cat reminded us that even in this inhospitable environment life still flourished. Soon we encountered a river, apparently frozen over with ice, but underneath the river could still be seen flowing rapidly. We hesitated and watched as a large spider began to cross the ice, then suddenly the ice gave way and the spider was swept away to its doom. Looking for a safer crossing, we could find none, so courageously, Bojo eased himself on to the ice from a low bank and ran across to the other side, heartened by his example Yabbernox and I followed.<p>Just as it seemed there would be no end to this snowy wasteland, we happened upon another group of adventurers, sheltering in the ruins of a large building and as luck would have it one of them offered to guide us to Permafrost. Following in his footsteps it transpired that we were already very close to our goal and we soon arrived at a large and imposing entrance set into the cliff side. Our guide stopped some distance from the gates and wishing us luck he returned whence he had came. Gathering our courage we moved slowly towards the courtyard that lay beyond the entrance, Bojo and Yabbernox slightly ahead of me stopped in their tracks and calling a warning they recoiled from the courtyard. Peering carefully around the wall, I espied the most horrible sight I had yet seen in these lands, a pair of monstrous ice giants stood just inside guarding the entrance, their cousins that we had met in the deserts and plains seemed mere striplings in comparison to these mighty creatures.<p>After some thought and spurred on by the failure of the giants to react to our initial intrusion, Yabbernox drew a deep breath and ran across the courtyard heading for the anti-chamber beyond. Seeing no sign of attack Bojo and I followed closely behind. On entering the chamber unmolested we paused and looking around became transfixed by the stark beauty of the room. Torches held in clawed hands caved from stone illuminated a high ceiling. The claws stirred old memories of Dragon bones that I had encountered while hunting in Ak’Anon in my youth… <p>This pause in our flight was to be our undoing. I was dragged back from my wonderment by the sudden force of a blow from behind. The strength of the blow was beyond any that I had withstood before and in a few short moments I was reduced to unconsciousness and transported to Halas by the grace of the gods. Yabbernox soon arrived at my side having bravely given his life rather than have the giant follow him towards some unsuspecting adventurers that lay in the path of his flight, but there was no sign of Bojo. Attached by bonds of camaraderie as we were, we could sense that he was in trouble and greatly weakened yet he seemed to have avoided death. It transpired that as he attempted to make good his escape, he had stumbled into a hidden corridor, protected by the illusion of a wall the giant had not followed him further.<p>After retracing our steps, Yabbernox and I managed to meet up with Bojo who had emerged from the hidden corridor some distance from the main gates to Permafrost. Following him back down the hidden way we were able to emerge close to the location of our bodies and recover our equipment from under the feet of the lurking giants. Returning to the safety of this hidden passage, we made camp and vowed to return to our exploring the next day. </blockquote>Excellent report, Hak!

&gt; After arriving foot sore and weary in Halas,
