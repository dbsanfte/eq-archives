<P>I'm considering hosting a gathering on Rathe

<BR>at Surefall Glade but I need some help. I want this to be a fun event, but I want it to help out the new players more than anything.
<BR>I thought I would give lessons on how to be a more effective group member and leader as I've written a treatise on this topic. I also thought I would speak about the evils of the gnolls and give a brief history of our long lasting war with them. I would like to have others of high rank prehaps speak about other issues such as effective tactics for soloing, what to hunt and where. Mayhaps someone can speak about the different trades skills. Basically everything we do here, except in game and as much in character as we can get it. This would not be limited to Druids, anyone can come.
<BR>Besides that, I thought a swimming contest across the lake and some dueling would be good too. Maybe a fishing contest or some other good ideas you might have. This is definately going to need someone other than me involved. Please give me your ideas and contact me at Boon@pcsonline.com
<BR>If you wish to help.
<BR>If this is successful in even a remote way, maybe it's something we can do all the time. When I have more solid dates and times, I will post here as well as submit to Rathe Rapsody, EQDruid, Stratics and even the much hated Vault.
<BR>Thanks,
<BR>Brennos
