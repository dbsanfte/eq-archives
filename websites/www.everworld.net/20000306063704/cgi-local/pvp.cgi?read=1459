<P>I just read in a post that someone thinks root spells will have a major advantage in PVP. Someone replied to it and said that root will not be that big of a deal. (i think it was tarquin)

<BR>Anyway, I have been thinking more about it and became worried.
<BR>I like paly, and sometimes monk. These two classes are not offensive spell casters. Yes paly has some, but not enough to kill anything, besides most of paly's DD spells are just against undead.
<P>Scenerio:
<BR>Your in a group of 4 or so. Two tanks, healer, and a mage. Your all walking, and all of a sudden your all rooted. All four of you. Six spell casters, (most spell casters, if not all get root, or a spell that makes NPC no move) So in this scenerio, your tanks are no use becuase they can't move, (can't reach target), the six mages start DD spelling you, one by one, you will drop, till all four of you are dead. You cleric and mage in your group will be shouting off their spells are the six targerts, but lets face it, the six will win.
<P>Now, of course the chances of this happening aren't to great.
<BR>First of all, if there are factions in place, so the six enemys won't be your same race, so they might not jump you.
<BR>Also you all have to be roughly the same level as you, also hard to get to happen.
<BR>And of course you have to be in the same area, on the same server.
<P>So the chances of the six mages being the same lvl, enemy race, same area, same server as you, are not big, but can happen. Course the six that jump you can also be warriors shooting arrows.
<P>Anyway, this could happen, would extremly not be fun. (understatement)
<P>If someone has a solution to this, like begging them not to kill you, might backfire and they might dance on your grave.
