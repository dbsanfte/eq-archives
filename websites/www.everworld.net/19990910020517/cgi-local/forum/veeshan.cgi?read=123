<P><This is a Veeshan only Event>

<P>Hail good people of Norrath,
<P>The power of Bertoxxulous is waning and Tunare is triumphant.
<P>For those of you that do not know what I am talking about, approximately 6 moons ago, I met face to face with Kordak, the evil Necromancer, servant to The Plaguebringer. Tunare called upon me and directed me to Lesser Faydark. I could not refuse Tunare's blessing, so I suited up and went without question to Lesser Faydark where I found Kordak awaiting my arrival. Without giving me a second glance he struck with his evil draining spells. As a ranger, I quickly adapted, fired my bow once and ran towards him drawing my sword and shield. The battle went on for what felt like days, but alas Kordak fell at my feet. With one final thrust, I sent my blade into his chest claiming victory. I defeated Kordak, but this battle won was even a greater victory for Tunare.
<P>I later heard that Bertoxxulous had resurrected Kordak and declared that he had but one last chance. Kordak was still weak from his battle with me and it would take many weeks before he would be able to challenge the side of good, or so I thought. I had no idea that Kordak's strive for power would blind him and cause him to make such foolish mistake. Not even three moons after his defeat by me, he lured 3 members of the Sacred Haven to their deaths. Sadly, for Kordak, his very return of power caused him to think that he had regained all his strength, so he challenged my guild's Templar, Grimsoar, to a duel. With ease Grimsoar began to cut Kordak down. Kordak seen the error in his ways and ran, probably because of his fear in having to face Bertoxxulous again. This was Kordak's only clever move and within
<BR>seconds he vanished into the darkness.
<P>Now, the final fight with Kordak is at hand. I say "final" because I now know that with Tunare's grace behind me and with Mithaniel Marr's added strength, I WILL win.
<P>Kordak, prepare! Your time is up, and I shall represent the Sacred Haven, Tunare, and Mithaniel Marr with your destruction!
<P>The battle will take place at the Dragon Bones, the Necromancers playground, in Steamfont, this Sunday at around 8pm EST (April 25th, 1999). After this battle, Kordak will be no more!
<P>All are welcome to come and watch, but please realize that you come at your own risk. We will be on Kordak's own turf and it is still unknown what Kordak may have waiting for us. Remember, he is Kordak, a servant of Bertoxxulous, The Plaguebringer, I do not expect him to go so easily.
<P>Thank you,
<BR>Sarcoth

&gt; Hail good people of Norrath, 

&gt; The power of Bertoxxulous is waning and 
&gt; Tunare is triumphant. 

&gt; For those of you that do not know what I am 
&gt; talking about, approximately 6 moons ago, I 
&gt; met face to face with Kordak, the evil 
&gt; Necromancer, servant to The Plaguebringer. 
&gt; Tunare called upon me and directed me to 
&gt; Lesser Faydark. I could not refuse Tunare's 
&gt; blessing, so I suited up and went without 
&gt; question to Lesser Faydark where I found 
&gt; Kordak awaiting my arrival. Without giving 
&gt; me a second glance he struck with his evil 
&gt; draining spells. As a ranger, I quickly 
&gt; adapted, fired my bow once and ran towards 
&gt; him drawing my sword and shield. The battle 
&gt; went on for what felt like days, but alas 
&gt; Kordak fell at my feet. With one final 
&gt; thrust, I sent my blade into his chest 
&gt; claiming victory. I defeated Kordak, but 
&gt; this battle won was even a greater victory 
&gt; for Tunare. 

&gt; I later heard that Bertoxxulous had 
&gt; resurrected Kordak and declared that he had 
&gt; but one last chance. Kordak was still weak 
&gt; from his battle with me and it would take 
&gt; many weeks before he would be able to 
&gt; challenge the side of good, or so I thought. 
&gt; I had no idea that Kordak's strive for power 
&gt; would blind him and cause him to make such 
&gt; foolish mistake. Not even three moons after 
&gt; his defeat by me, he lured 3 members of the 
&gt; Sacred Haven to their deaths. Sadly, for 
&gt; Kordak, his very return of power caused him 
&gt; to think that he had regained all his

&gt; clever move and within 
&gt; seconds he vanished into the darkness. 

&gt; Now, the final fight with Kordak is at hand. 
&gt; I say &quot;final&quot; because I now know 
&gt; that with Tunare's grace behind me and with 
&gt; Mithaniel Marr's added strength, I WILL win.

&gt; I do not expect him to go so easily.
