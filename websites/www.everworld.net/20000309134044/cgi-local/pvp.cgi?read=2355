<P>Was wondering if anyone has tested pvp at all levels? I mean, say since I'm good at the ranger, warrior, and druid at low levels, why not get a bunch of us together, all make newbies, and go to say some where and duel it out. For example, I could make a human druid, get him to 5th level (lets say half way threw level 5), and equiped with non twinked gear that he could get, and then some one who is good at necromancy or what ever, go and do the same. Then we meet and battle a few times... okay a lot of time :), and see just how bad or good the classes are. What Brad ought to do, is find people who are doing good on the servers with each class, and then take them to say a test server, and test from level 5 threw 50 (testing at 5th level, then at 10th level, etc.) And see how it compares. I would be willing to do this, and they should assign some gm's and guides to watch, heck let brad come out with his ranger and see what happens. As its a test server, they could just assign the stats and skills and gears that people would have for that class at that level.

<BR>As a rant, I personally think they ought to up the damage level that the weapons do, especially the archery and throwing weapons. Why not do that on a test server, get a bunch to try it out, and see if it would imbalance it. Personally I feel that if I get close enough to a naked mage, and I hit him with my weapon, I should crush him like a tin can under my trucks tire. Also, if I'm faster than him, and I'm using a fast as greased lighting weapon, I should slice him to shreds so he can't cast. Just a beef I have, as I'd much rather be the grunt with the guts, instead of the fly boy with the reach... plus chicks dig INFANTRY!!! Whoo hoo! On that note, ever seen a bunch of jet jocks get in a fight with some combat engieners or line grunts? hehe not a pretty sight.
<BR>Anyway, I really think they got some things right, like that we all can move at basically the same speed (not on how your ping time is), and the graphics and the fact we need to play as a team! Man, I love working as a team! There are too many solo stuff around, lets make it team work, but balanced team work.
<BR>Anyway, I'll stop ranting and go back to killing stuff,,,
