</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>That is a stupid idea and let me tell you why. The main reason is that you are not RPing well and you want others to take the blame for it. Ok, so you left Grobb and were mercilessly slayed at the hands of some same race PK(I am assuming the worst case whine scenario). Now what you do here instead of whining to the PK is make up a story for why he killed you. Present it to him. If he doesn't RP back then ignore him and make your own story to the encounter. Why does that Froglok PK you? Oh he is not a PC so he can't PK you he can only kill you? *smirk*. It's the same thing. The froglock is an enemy to all trolls(His RP reason for attacking you). The PK(and his gang) is/are an enemy to all Troll because their parents were brutally murdered by Trolls that were above the law(or whatever). The point is, RZ is a harder place to play, but you can RP alot more. It is up to you to RP, not anyone else on the server. You may find people you can RP with, stick with them.

<P>Now enough on my RP rant I want to tear apart your stupid "Winning and losing XP" idea. This discourages any type of PvP, RP or not. Why would you want to do that? People that don't RP but like to powergame and/or PK shouldn't be punished for that. It is how they enjoy the game. If someone kills you just for loot and an item just because they can, what is wrong with that? They are obviously evil. You have the option to kill them back. RP it if you want. Outlevel them and attack again if you want(the difference between Quake and EQ, on extra dimension that is sometimes fun). But what definately doesn't need to be done is to cater the game to the people that can't handle getting killed by another player on the PvP server(YOU DON'T EVEN LOSE XP FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!! WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?).
<P>Apologies if my thoughts weren't too orderly, this was in a background window and added to off and on for a couple hours(work and all).
