<P>> The pvp has become way to sanitary on the Rallos Zek server. I'd

<BR>&gt; like to toss out a few things to add some excitement while
<BR>&gt; leveling the field in some areas.
<P>&gt; 1. MAKE SPELL BOOKS LOOTABLE. Whether it be just a single spell
<BR>&gt; or the whole book. They should be lootable. I was origionaly
<BR>&gt; thinking that only 1 spell should be lootable, but I'm now in
<BR>&gt; favor of being able to loot the entire book. It just makes more
<BR>&gt; sence that you would be able to take the whole book instead of
<BR>&gt; ripping out a single page. This would be doable as long as you
<BR>&gt; can buy extra empty spell books so that you can have a backup if
<BR>&gt; your spells get swipped. As for the other spell casters out
<BR>&gt; there don't whine about the cost of spells. Everyone has
<BR>&gt; equiptment that costs money. A warrior's chiten tunic is worth a
<BR>&gt; filled 1 - 4 lvl spell book and some. This would also allow a
<BR>&gt; wizzard to create spell books they use for specific zones. With
<BR>&gt; more than one spell book you could pick and choose. It will end
<BR>&gt; up being more fun and interesting. Playing a troll Shadow knight
<BR>&gt; I have few places i can travel without the possiblity of having
<BR>&gt; to run across 4 or more zones to go find my body. I would luv to
<BR>&gt; find some little halfling bound to the swamp kill him take his
<BR>&gt; spell book and have him struggle to make it to the safety of
<BR>&gt; Feerport. Its will ad more to the rollplaying that everyone
<BR>&gt; whines about all the time.
<P>&gt; 2. ANYONE THAT DIES SHOULD COME BACK WITH ZERO MANA. Being risen
<BR>&gt; for the dead so to speak ( comming back ) with full mana just
<BR>&gt; doesn't make sence. Any spell caster should come back with 0
<BR>&gt; mana and have to med to get it back. Will this make a spell
<BR>&gt; caster vulnrable? Yes it will. They will be just as helpless as
<BR>&gt; a warrior without their weapon. Just a lvl field. Can the
<BR>&gt; unarmed Warrior kick the unarmed wizzard rear? I sure hope so,
<BR>&gt; he / she is a warrior they should be able to.
<P>&gt; 3. THE +4 / -4 RANGE NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED. 4 plus or minus is
<BR>&gt; just to small. I'm in favor of switching to the +8 / -8 or
<BR>&gt; removing the limits all together. Whats the use of becoming an
<BR>&gt; awe inspiring lvl 50 if you can't flaunt it. A level 50 could
<BR>&gt; attack a town causing the lvl 20's to band to gether to fight
<BR>&gt; them. It will open up the roll playing experience. Will it cause
<BR>&gt; anarchy at first? Problably, you will have those that abuse it.
<BR>&gt; Till those that have been killed or someone above the pk in
<BR>&gt; question hunts them down.
<P>&gt; 4. ADD MORE TO THE EXISTING TRADES. ie smiths and tailors should
<BR>&gt; a t some point be able to make magic armor and weapons.
<BR>&gt; Yeah I'm a wanna be smith. Not an easy thing for a Troll. Doable
<BR>&gt; just not easy. So far I've sunk 150pp plus in the skill and I'm
<BR>&gt; still under 40. I'd like to see things pay off when you get to a
<BR>&gt; high skill lvl. It would make the whole trade idea more
<BR>&gt; desirerable and interesting. Maybe an enchanter, a Master Jewler
<BR>&gt; and a Master Smith could get together to produce magic armor
<BR>&gt; that no one has seen. It would be interesting to see. I don't
<BR>&gt; know much about the other trades so I can't speak for them. I
<BR>&gt; just know that the pursuit of creating the finest weapon would
<BR>&gt; become a quest that many a smith seeks.
<P>&gt; 5. ADD AN UNDERGROUND ZONE TO THE OTHER CONTINENTS OR ALLOW EVIL
<BR>&gt; RACES SPECIAL BINDING. I'd luv to go attack the dwarf of wood
<BR>&gt; elf city. The only problem is that if by some miracle I get
<BR>&gt; there. If I get killed I have to travel from a distant continent
<BR>&gt; to get to my body / equiptment. If there was an underground zone
<BR>&gt; between continents was implimented with some bind points, and
<BR>&gt; evil guards along the way I would be more that happy as a lvl 6
<BR>&gt; Troll to go hunt wood elves in there home town. or add mayhem
<BR>&gt; and fear to the erudites life. Just think of the rp experiences.
<P>&gt; WHETHER THIS OR ANY OF THE SUGGESTIONS WHERE MADE. I'd move
<BR>&gt; sevrers if nessisary to get better rp experience.
<P>&gt; Peace,
<P>&gt; Squigge Da'FizzeeBasher
<P>&gt; Shadow Knight of Grobb
