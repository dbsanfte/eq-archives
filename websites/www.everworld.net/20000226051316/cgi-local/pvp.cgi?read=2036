<P>Ok i have tried to play the game EQ, and its fun at first, until Everquest turns into Levelquest. Its just that on the pvp server everyone is trying there best to level, because if someone is a couple levels above you it usually means instant death if they attack you. The con button is the biggest pk tool ever created. Theres no damn balance in classes, and as soon as more and more people realize this you will 1000 wizards running around zapping each other. The +4-4 makes it almost impossible to have guilds. If one person plays the game 7 hours a day or more,"Ala couch potatoes," and you have some friends that dont get to play the game that much , or works like me, then you can more or less never hope to hit level 50 were pvp will be a little more balanced other than wizards shooting your ass with 1100+ damage spells. So most of my friends now dont get to group with each other because of the level situation. And Leveling,*Grumbles*, I am stuck at level 19 now, and i get roughly 2 - 3 hours to play the game a day, and when i die , i loose roughly 6 hours of time it would take to get my experience back to were it was, which more or less is two days, and damn that isnt even taking in to consideration if you get killed more than once in a day.

<P>Anyway, Everquest to me has so much potential to be a great pvp game, but heres a couple things i know they wont fix, but i feel would make the game, well FUN, rather than make it feel like ajob leveling. 1. Make it to were leveling isnt as horrible, Take away experience loss at death, i guarntee if you took a poll most would agree this sucks a big one, now the people who get to play 24/7 might agree with experience loss, but not most of us, who want to get in the big guild wars, and pvp combat, but instead have to slave hours and hours monster bashing=boaring. 2. I think level 50 shouldnt be so damn hard to reach if level 50 was were lets say level 30 is now, then it wouldnt be so bad. But the way it is now unless you play the game 24/7 you dont have much chance hitting it. 3. Please balance out the classes at least somewhat. I mean true wizards are supposed to be baddasses but the way it is now, its just way to powerful, and this results in just everyone eventually making wizards.
<P>In closing this is just my views on the game, I think EQ has great graphics, character races, and a huge world. But the way it is for the people who dont have the time to put in it as others, it turns into a very frustrating game. For instance why would someone become a warrior, if all you have to look forward to is getting rooted then couple spells from the wizard, DEATH. I mean my shadow knight is looking alot less apealling when i see how easy a wizard dominates us. Also hell they have great gateing spells to, Guess ill make a wizard like anyone who wants to dominate pvp combat.
