<P>If you are a little worried about being in a guild, or the thought of having officers and a hierarchy just isn't your style, there is an alternative. The Jesters Club.

<P>The Jesters Club is a group of fun loving people who are looking for a way to have even more fun. The Jesters Club currently has over 40 members. It has no leader, it has no real rules and regulations [the only one is we don't except people who are jerks and hated by everyone]. You can even join the Jesters Club and be in another guild. The primary purpose of the club is to make it easier for members to form groups and discuss things.
<P>If you want to find out the type of people in the Jesters Club, go to the Bertox Bulletin on everworld.net and see the types of people who post there, the bulk are members of the jesters club.
<P>For those who don't currently belong to a guild, the jesters club is forming an online guild maninly to allow members to talk easier while playing. But the Club is not a guild, no fancy titles, a total democracy. To find out more, go to:
<P>http://jestersclub.icestorm.com
<P>The site is very new [all coding has been done during last 2-3 weeks], but its amazing what a club of 40+ equal memebers can achieve in that time.
<P>If you are interested send me an email at savindwarf@yahoo.com. The Jesters Club will have an online enrollment mechanism in about 2 weeks.
