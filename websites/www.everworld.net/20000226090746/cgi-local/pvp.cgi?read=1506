<P>I played a few characters briefly on the PvP server in Phase 4, and while I like the way Pvp can add to roleplaying on the whole I decided I wouldn't be playing on it in final. Reading this board, and seeing that the Everquest PVP GM is active on here, I thought I'd ask a few questions, and if I get the answers I'm looking for maybe I'll change my mind. Here are the major issues I can see with PvP in Everquest.

<P>1) When you die, you can be looted by anyone, even if you were killed by an NPC. It's too easy to die at the hands of Everquest's NPCs, you shouldn't have to face losing your best item each time you die. The worst memories I have of the PVP server involve me running from an enemy to a group of players, only to have them sit there and watch me die so they could loot my body. In addition, I don't like how easy it is for people to watch you fighting and wait till you kill your enemy, then finish you off.
<P>2) Guards protect PKs. I and several friends all rolled up characters on the PVP server at the same time, safety in numbers right? We were getting our first few levels in West Freeport, still level 1 or 2, when a Dark elf Wizard level 5 started killing newbies. He killed probably half a dozen level 1 or 2 people before attacking one of us. He was surprised when he found himself facing four people, and ran to the guards to heal. The point here is, whether or not Freeport guards let Dark elves into the city, they should NOT let them kill humans and then sit there and meditate. The PVP server NEEDS a faction system; I wouldn't mind terribly being killed by dark elves in the wilds of the Commonlands, but having a Dark elf attack us then run hide behind the Human guards is ridiculous.
<P>Even if those two issues were resolved, I think there's one more thing that'd be needed before I and, probably, other roleplayers interested in PVP will come to the Rallos Zek server - the faction system and guard NPC AI need to be aided by GM intervention. No matter how good the guard AI turns out to be, there will always be ways around it. In that case, when some Dark elf again figures out a way to kill newbies in West Freeport, a GM should take over a guard and deal with him. Guards should not be nearly as stupid as they are.
<P>These are my thoughts, I hope someone can respond to this in answer to my questions. Have decisions been made on these points? Is a faction system coming, as I've heard rumored? Are they going to make NPC killed PC corpses unlootable? And if so, when?
