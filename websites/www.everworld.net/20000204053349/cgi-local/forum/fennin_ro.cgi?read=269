<P>Fen sits in a large chair in the middle of an abandoned building. All the windows and doors are boarded up from the inside. He sits staring at the fireplace, as the wood burns with a light crackle. Somewhat mezmerized he almost doesn't notice the small hand reach around the chair as if to grab him. With in a second he is standing at the side of the chair holding his sabre at the neck of young halfling.

<P>"Ey! I didn't mean nothing, no sir. I was just trying to get your attention. I wouldn't have tried to take anything, no sir, not at all." Fen looks at the small man then around the room trying to figure out where he came in. No access point is evident. Either this guy was teleported in, or he was one damned goob break in artist. Not waiting for the rogue to remove his weapon the halfling continues, "Um, well, My name's Bucho. The master told me to come here, he said he had something for you. I don't know what it is, but these go with it." He holds out a large key and a rolled up piece of paper.
<P>Fen stares at him with a peculiar look on his face. Realizing that this man was obviously of no threat he pulls his saber away and sheaths it, then reaches down and takes the items from the halfling. "Go ahead. Read it. Don't you worry about me. Just go ahead."
<P>Fen slides the silk ribbon off the parchment and unroles it. Infront of him is a map of the area around the house he is in. It is mostly empty accept for a detailed drawing of a cave opening on the side of hill. Over the drawing it reads The Labrynth. At the bottem of the parchment is written, "I was going to get you something expensive, but I'm sure you wouldn't have liked that. So instead I got you the thrill of the hunt. The map goes to a maze I had built into your world. I am sure it will test your abilities for many days, or more. Don't worry you will not be disappointed when you get there. I just hope you can get back out with what you find. Now you owe me three, Spiros"
<P>The rogue looks up with a grin, then lowers the parchment to talk with Bucho about the maze. He is quickly disappointed when he is greeted by thin air. Once again he looks around the room, and once again he sees nothing out of place.
