</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> How long does it take a new character to make 10pp? A week? Two

<BR>&gt; weeks? Until he reaches level 7-8? Now how does it *NOT*
<BR>&gt; imbalance the game for a level 1 player to run into Blackburrow
<BR>&gt; and loot a fallen player of a 10pp item?
<P>Enumeration:
<P>1. A first level character takes a lot of time to build up the cash that they
<BR>also have the capability of getting 'lucky' and looting off of another character,
<BR>or getting the money from a higher level friend.
<P>Your example is a 1st level character running in to where a higher level
<BR>character was killed and looting their corpse w/o getting killed. Brave
<BR>fellow, he is.
<P>It's possible for people to get more money than they should if they worked
<BR>at it by killing monsters. Ok, let's look below for why that's bad.
<P>&gt; The imbalance is so obvious that it hardly merits further
<BR>&gt; discussion, yet for the learning challenged I'll try to break it
<BR>&gt; down for you.
<P>I'm afraid the original comment was that it breaks the economy. And frequently,
<BR>the 'obvious' is a knee-jerk reaction. (Used by jerks. Let's leave attacks like
<BR>'learning challenged' out of it. It'll be much nicer just to discuss, and try to
<BR>determine what's going on by having people look at points on both sides and
<BR>make up their minds, instead of reacting to unsupported statements, just
<BR>because it seems to make sense before you analyze. That's how many con's and
<BR>elections work. That's not how civilized people talk on a discussion page.)
<P>Two examples of what a low level character can do follow.
<P>&gt;With 10pp a starting mage could buy all of their
<BR>&gt; 1st and 5th circle spells, and have money left over for a decent
<BR>&gt; weapon.
<P>&gt;A fighter could pick up at least a few pieces of full
<BR>&gt; leather armor, or a real weapon (not rusted).
<P>&gt;Having well above
<BR>&gt; average spells, weapons, and armor at lower levels allows these
<BR>&gt; characters to fight longer (they are taking less damage), kill
<BR>&gt; more opponents (they are dealing out more damage), make money
<BR>&gt; faster (they are looting more creatures faster), and more or
<BR>&gt; less dominate other characters at their level in PvP conflicts.
<P>ADDENDUM: Other characters who started at the same time. They
<BR>had to loot from someone, so I assume that the servers just came
<BR>up, and they're behind a LOT of people.
<P>&gt; Finally, that 10th level character who lost an expensive piece
<BR>&gt; of gear to a newbie looter is set back financially. There was no
<BR>&gt; reason they should have been subject to looting simply due to
<BR>&gt; death to a MOB.
<P>1. The player was set back because he lost an item (an expensive item)
<BR>when he died.
<P>2. There wasn't a reason that he should be looted just because a MOB
<BR>killed him.
<P>I think that people choose PvP because it's more exciting, and more
<BR>realistic in many ways. If you die, you frequently lose your cash, and
<BR>an item. Feel your heart beat while trying to get to that corpse.
<BR>Elation! No one got there first! Dejection! Someone looted me!
<BR>Freaking bottomfeeder! I've got to be more careful! Maybe stick
<BR>my valuable weapon in a bag when I die. Oops, didn't make it into
<BR>the bag in time. I'm down a lot, and another player is up some.
<BR>I suppose because this goes both ways, I should have had a party
<BR>with me. Maybe I should be adventuring with friends if I want to fight
<BR>MOBs at level 25, and they can loot for me when I die, yeah!
<P>Anyway, my point is that some planning and some friends can alleviate
<BR>much of what you consider a problem. But sometimes it won't. There's
<BR>no 100% certain way of stopping it from happening. A bit like real life.
<P>I digress though, the question was whether or not a lower level character
<BR>getting items early signifigantly affects the economy. They'll be a little
<BR>better off faster than their peers are. (People who start at the same time.)
<P>&gt;The game was not balanced with such a condition
<BR>&gt; in mind. For non PvP players on all other servers, they do not
<BR>&gt; run this risk.
<P>People play PvP because of risks and rewards and realism.
<P>&gt; Now extrapolate this problem a bit further to a 10th level
<BR>&gt; character that loots an 80pp item off of a 25th
<BR>&gt; level...hopefully by now everyone gets the point.
<P>Oops, I replied to this part higher up. Sorry about that.
<P>&gt; The sooner the non-PvP death looting is fixed, the better.
<P>So:
<P>1. Lower level players can get cash and items out of their level earlier.
<BR>2. The person they loot loses an investment.
<BR>3. The person who looted can go up in level a bit faster, as he's better equipped.
<P>Let me know if I missed a point. I don't see where this hurts the game economy,
<BR>except by people saying that it's obvious that it does. A first or 5th level character
<BR>in higher level armor still has his skill cap to contend with. Items do NOT make
<BR>the character. Test this if you want to. I've seen it tested. You have an advantage,
<BR>but you can't go after creatures out of your range.
