<P>> Kind of silly for a rogue who chooses

<BR>&gt; to be an unscrupulous thief to sneak off to a troll town and try
<BR>&gt; to rob them when they recognize him on sight and KOS him, when
<BR>&gt; he could do the same thing to people of his race. But, again,
<BR>&gt; under this system, this makes his life hell, and nearly
<BR>&gt; unplayable.
<P>I disagree.
<P>Imagine that someone moves into the house next-door to you. Shortly thereafter, you notice various things around the neighborhood start to go missing. You notice that your new neighbor suddenly is aquiring a lot of "stuff" which bears more than a passing similarity to the stuff which is now mysteriously vanishing. Do you say "Well, that's fine because my new neighbor would never do anything wrong like that. There must be a logical explanation." Or do you start to suspect foul play? Perhaps you call the local police and report that you suspect you neighbor is a thief?
<P>Killing, stealing and pilliaging in EQ will get you the same thing.
<BR>If you're a less scrupulous character, of course you're going to be hated and feared. A murderer or thief is not going to welcomed with open arms into the local populous, no matter what his race. Commit crimes against any race (not neccessarily just your own) and that race will look down on you.
<P>The solution is to split the various factions of each race. You might be killed on sight by the guards of Qeynos, but be welcomed with open arms in Freeport. Actually, if you are so notorious that the Qeynos guards would seek to kill you outright, word of your misdeeds will likely preceed you and you will find Freeport (a continent away) less hostile, but not much more trusting. Try Kaladim or Felwithe. The further you go, the less likely they will have heard of you.
<P>And, unless I've been reading things wrong, this is exactly how the faction system currently works. No problem, no soultion.
