<P>I was fairly disapointed after reading what Geoferry Zatkin had to say below.

<P>Oh. There is a TINY (like 1-2% out of 100) bonus added on for
<P>people a level to three above you for resistances. Quite possibly it is the
<P>fact that they higher level people have better equipment, or have defensive
<P>spells up on them.
<P>Our system is heavily based on skills. Giving somebody a flaming
<P>avenger at first level just won't do much to help them - they don't have the
<P>skill to use it. Level, which sets your skill caps, is very important. A
<P>6th level guy can probably take out two level 4's. A 30th level guy can
<P>probably take out two level 24-25's. That is how all the combat equations
<P>have been written, and how we have balanced game play.
<P>Superior weapons and equipment will help - a level 25 with equipment
<P>could take out a level 30 if the level 30 was naked, or in poor equipment.
<P>But two equally-equipped equally-skilled warriors of level 25 and 30? The
<P>30 would win. Hands down in a one on one fight.
<P>For casters it is a little different - the spells they use make all
<P>the difference. But yes, the guy 2 levels above you will save a bit better.
<P>Unless she has a resist fire and you huck a fire bolt at her - then she will
<P>save a lot better.

<P>I think it is in full agreement with everyone who PvPs this is not what we want. We want it so a lvl 25 has a fair chance to take out a level 30 and so on. Pvping just is not as fun if it is all level based. The fact a lvl 30 can take out two level 24s, TWO people who are a mere 5-6 levels below him is ludicrous. Whats the point of having this +-4 level pk window thing if you cannot kill anyone higher then you? Pking is a lot more viable and fun when it is based on skill. Yes a lvl 29 should have an advantage over a level 25. Not a huge advantage, but a slight one, basically the amount of hitpoints each has and that should be it. It is kind of a bummer when you know you are not gonna be able to take someone who is 4 levels above you regardless at how good at pvping you are compared to him. Its not cool that the guy who spends the most time killing monsters is the best at pvping just because of his level. I do not think it is too late to change any of us, but judging by Zatkin's statement above I am sorry to say I do not think anything will be done about this, just because of the relative smallness of the pvp community in eq.
