<P>I don't mean to insult you,but it has to be done because I have listened to your irritating boasts and self praises on ooc long enough.And I know other players feel the same way I do.I'm NOT saying you're a tottaly bad guy.I actually have had some rather pleasant conversations with you.But do you really feel it's needed to be this snotty and arrogant.I for one am a helper(not in Black smithing I can barely sharpen a dagger)I will give someone my last plat if they need it and I have enough food to last me until I can get more money.And I've listened to you run around whining because someone was killing the lower level orcs because you needed to level(Do you realise how selfish that makes you sound?)You cannot possibly expect other players to sit around and wait for you to level.Now don't get me wrong I don't condone kill stealing,but if they get to it first then it's their kill.As a matter of fact I stole one of your kills to prove a point to you when you decided to insulted me for killing the lower level orcs which you felt you were entitled to.Remember "this isn't your personal bank JERk"those were your EXACT words and I apologised for stealing your kill later even though you told me to @#$% off.But back to my point that's in the past and we agreed not to be idiots and fight over stupid stuff like kids and after that you were nice enough to save my life and believe it or not I am grateful.Although I do think people harrass you a little to much you kinda bring it on your self.Oh well I hope you don't take this message personally because other than your occasional selfishness and self praise I like you.I'm just saying you could be a little nicer because I'd help you out if you needed it as I would any other player but if you crap on others that's what you'll get in return.I'm sure by now you know who I am thanks for your time and patience.Sorry about the heading but I wanted your attention.

<BR>And I hope this doesn't cause any greife between us.
