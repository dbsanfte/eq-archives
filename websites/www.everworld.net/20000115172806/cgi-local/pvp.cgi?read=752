<P>> The first and biggest mistake you made was to stereotype PvP to

<BR>&gt; what you saw in UO.
<P>I think this is a common mistake. Too many online gamers are new to the genre. For most, UO was the first multiplayer game they played. I've actually had some claim that I was outright -lying- when I told them I have been playing online RPGs for ten years. Before UO just doesn't exist for them.
<P>&gt; The second thing you did was try to segregate PvP from Roleplay.
<BR>&gt; Roleplay in the truest form of the word has as much to do with
<BR>&gt; PvP as it does with PvE. Let think for a second. Are there any
<BR>&gt; PvE People apposed to killing bandits or brigands? It was
<BR>&gt; actually a quite popular way to obtain chrysknives at one time.
<BR>&gt; What is the difference as far as role play is concered from
<BR>&gt; Killing a bandit for money or items or just for storyline or
<BR>&gt; actually killing a Rogue controlled by another player for money
<BR>&gt; or items or storyline? THe only difference is that you'll have
<BR>&gt; to deal with the human side rather than a predictable NPC. That
<BR>&gt; has absolutely nothing (IMO) to do with Roleplaying, the turnoff
<BR>&gt; comes at the hands of those who would dance the Cha Cha Cha on
<BR>&gt; your corpse and Taunt you after they killed you with
<BR>&gt; "Owned" and "Thats right Biatch!". Yes there
<BR>&gt; exists a turnoff to PvP (can come from the human factor), but
<BR>&gt; that is hardly a complete or accurate representation what PvP
<BR>&gt; is, rather just a small part of it that is undesirable. Its our
<BR>&gt; mission here to REDEFINE PvP UNIQUELY for EQ. It should
<BR>&gt; definitely be part of the community.
<P>To make PvP a community building experience, it must be:
<BR>1. Difficult
<BR>2. Risky
<BR>3. Involve significant sacrifice upon failure
<P>EQ has IMHO all three of these, in the majority of cases. Attacking another similarly leveled player is a definite risk. If you lose, he gets your most prized possesion. The major problem (to me anyway) is that a single level of experience will pretty much decide the battle. A fifth level character will almost always defeat a fourth level character. While it might be more "realistic", from a gameplay aspect, it stinks to high heaven.
<P>I don't have any inside information on combat in EQ, but I'm fairly sure that it involves some sort of random factor (which is likely limited or modified based on relative skill levels and such). Maybe if the random portion of the combat system was given a larger weight? Then the differences between a single level would be lessened. But if the random factor is too great, then level differences become meaningless. A balance needs to be found where a difference of one or two levels is pretty much non-existant, but a difference of four of five levels is significant.
<P>I'd hate to be the guy who has to fine tune that. Good luck.
