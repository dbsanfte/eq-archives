<P>Saw this posted on the vault, makes sense, long post though

<P>Gnomes, Dwarfs, Halflings: Will do well, take over Faydwer. All they have against them is the elves, not a threat.
<P>High Elf, Half Elf, Woodelf: This team is doomed. They all start in one zone, Greater Faydark. One dungeon, Crushbone, nice to lvl 15 or so, thats it.
<BR>This team will not get lvled enough to defend itself against the short team.
<BR>Can't leave Faydwer, they can and will be attacked by every team on the Antonica.
<P>Human, Barbarian, Erudite: Will do ok, why? Besides Freeport, the starting cities of this team are tucked away. What team wants to attack Qeynos? Lets say evil team attacks Qeynos. Couple questions, where will non-castors be binded to? Isn't the closest binding point at least 20 min walk through very dangerous zones? No warrior type is going to bring all his armour to Qeynos and fight. Basicaly long raids won't work. In a few weeks or so, there will be attacks on Erudin. Why? Simple, Wizards and Druids get teleportation spells, right in to Erudite newbie zone. True, the other teams won't be able to bind there, but there will be wars. But on the whole, long distance raids won't be extremly effective.
<P>Dark Elf, Ogre, Troll: This team will shine, 90% of the high lvl dungeons, it might take sometime, but in the long run, this team will control the land of Norrath. Why? Humans have Permafrost, short team has Dragons Kauldron, Kedge keep, Unrest, and Steamfont. Guk, Lavastorm, Soulseks, Najena, and a couple more are all near evil territory. What good can other teams do when this team is higher lvls??
<P>There are many problems in PVP combat in EQ,
<BR>1)naked mages
<BR>2)wizard spells are to high
<BR>3)Being killed by Damage Over Time spells and players Pets results in experince loss. This has been on Rallos Zek since day one, Verant so far has not fixed it.
<BR>4) Another thought, Mages can't cast on a boat, but can warriors attack on a boat? If so, talk about a slaughter. Pay back time for Warriors.
<P>Don't have to explain Naked Mages, read the other rants.
<P>Wizard spells are to high. Why? Because the NPC's in Everquest are designed at higher lvls to have massive Hit Points compared to PC's, so wizards spells are made very powerful to compensate. PC warriors are not as powerful as any NPC high lvl, the game is designed that way. Logic tells you wizards spells are to powerful against PC's because the spells are designed to be used against NPC's.
<P>Everquest from the ground up was to be designed for Player vs. Enviroment.
<BR>Not Player vs. Player. Everything tells you this, besides Brads statement in a interview that he though EQ's NPC's would make a great challenge. So far this is true, look at all the servers that house PVE players, but guess what? In a few months when most players are above lvl 40, since this is a static game, nothing changes, gnolls will be in BB, skels in Unrest, and Lady Vox in here home no matter how many times you kill them, the game doesn't change. Sure you lvl 50, but what can you do? You can start a guild, help newbies, etc. etc... but this game will not change for your character. You will never change the game, you can kill all the NPC's in Freeport. So what? They respawn, do it again, same result. The only thing that changes is the players, not the enviroment. Kill a Dark Elf Cleric, he will remember, hunt you down, get friends, make you defend yourself, never know when retruibution will happen, but it will. Play on Rallos Zek, revenge does happen. Guess what I'm trying to say is, Everquest will not change, you can, but the game won't, you will never log on one day and see your hometown under attack, and having to rally with your friends and having to defend it. Sure, you might be happy to slay your first gnoll, your first wolly mammoth, but after 10 times, who cares, you know the outcome of the battle, with PVP you never truly know.
<P>Alot of people are making solutions to the NMS, Naked Mage Syndrom. Frankly there are really none.
<P>1) Take a spell off corpse, yes sounds reasonable, but imagine the coding it will take. The spell will have to leave the spell book too, this solution won't happen overnight. And instead of Warriors complaing, Magic users will complain. Doesn't realy fix problem, just makes the other half have the same pain as the melee types. Though this solution sounds good, if it even does get implemented, it will take a long while, and players don't have patince at all.
<P>2) Loot from bags, this also seems reasonable. This is pretty much the opposite of the first solution. Instead of everyone having a huge loss when they die, they make it so, its not a huge problem. To me, this is not the road Verant wants to take. If you make a game where dying is just a minor annyonace, then people will just be suicidle, not much fun there.
<P>This is a great game, I just wished Race War worked. To make PVP work, it will take a complete overhaul of the spell system, the map will have to change to help Elfs. Any solution would take months to work, and frankly isn't worth the time and effort. Accept what there is know, or go to the normal servers or leave. Thats realy the options.
<P>Making the NPC guards attack against other teams, basiclay KOS them, doesn't work, then it would be close to impossible for teams to ally for a battle. Sorry, this doesn't realy work, to many cons to out weigh the pros.
<P>To summarize, Everquest was designed from the ground up as a PVE game, the DD spells are designed for hgih lvl NPC's, the dungeons are placed more in evil territory, so other teams will have to fight through the evil team, you might be cocky before the fight, but this fight never ends, kill the player, he respawns, and is in your face again, you won't reach the dungeons. NMS, read other rants, they say all.
<BR>This is a great game, a great PVE game.
<BR>You can't take a PVE game, and make it PVP. Everquest is a great example.
<P>PS: Kinda off topic, but when Soverign comes out, goodbye EQ. Its a Real Time Strategy, created by Uncle John (no, not my real uncle, just a Nickname, no I don't know him, just wanted to give him a nickname), himself. John Smeldy that is. Yup, Verant did great with MMORPG (massive multiplayer online roleplaying game) they are know off to conquer RTS. From the review I read in PCGAMER, August issue, should be a great game.
<P>PS: Kinda off topic again, more on Verant. Everyone remembers the opening of the first Race War server, disaster. I have been playing since phase 3 beta, 9 months now, I trust Verant, they deal with alot of junk, everywants there characer to be a GOD, can't, will mess up the game. For PVE its extremly balanced, accept it, any kinda tinker has to be thought over, judged by Verant, takes lot of time. Please people have some damn PATIENCE!: )
