<P>>

<BR>Greeting to you from a humble Necromancer, please sit yourself down. Oh yes, you may move those human skins off that chair. You inquired about spell damage then did you not, well then allow me to help.
<BR>First of all for pure damage in spell casting the Wizard is second to none in the damage ratio. An example is that the 4th level necro spell Heat Blood causes around 160 points of damage, while no expert on the wizardly ways I must say the the wizard may be able to out power that if he were of the same level as I. On my side of the coin is that my spell a damage over time spell. This means that it causes damage each round until the full 160 is reached. Meaning 16 pionts per round for example. This way not only can these spells be stacked with others, causing more destruction, but this gives one the time to concertrate on defense to avoid an opponents blows. Wizards can't do that.
<P>Secondly the idea of blasting one's enemies to bits before they are able to counterattack is most welcome in my mind. I will be the first to say that should my spell casting abilities ever leave me, and all I can see is that little dagger in my hand, my running skills will improve dramatically. Alas we cannot fight as well as some others can, so we use firepower at range. If you were a rogue, then you'd have to get close to your enemy, this puts you at risk. Now I, on the other hand, simply order my skeleton pet to attack whilst I stand behind and hit them with spellpower. I am at little risk.
<P>Thirdly, a rogue will never be as mighty as a warrior or as skilled in combat as a monk. At best his swordplay is average, it is the backstab in which he truly shines. Yet those attack must be made from the rear of the target and can only be made once.
<P>My advice to you is to take hold of the reigns of power and join the ranks of the arcane.
<BR>Or better yet ( sly grin ) turn to the darkness and become one of the true masters of sorcery, become a Necromancer.
