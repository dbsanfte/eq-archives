<P>Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a message board for testing and improving PvP with the switch and PvP on the PvP server. I don't see why you came here. No one is gonna nod with you because the only people here are the ones your whining at. Give me a break, I am no "kEwLd00d". "kEwLd00d" started with a comic that was about 2 newbie PK'rs and their journey's. It took on form to be used against anyone who enjoyed PvP. You got the wrong idea. I am no 'killah', I am a human being that finds fun in a little action, not like a fps, but more than Baldur's Gate RPG. I like the little spice of watching my back in new territory. I think really by coming here and trying to offend me showed who is really grown up. You remind me of the guy in UO when I came to RP at Kazola's with fellow guildmates playing as pirates, drinking and cursing and harassing ladies. Some roleplayer goes out of character and tells us to leave cause we don't rp all the time. What happens? We kill the guy for insulting us when we try to get along and ENRICH their RP universe. Next thing you know we end up fighting for our lives against every RP'r online on the Great Lakes Shard (I will tell you Great Lakes has the buffest RP'rs, most were powergamers early in UO). Got the tables being stacked in the doorway constantly, throwing Electric Bolts out the door with Arrows and Bolts too, and having anyone that gets through the tables by moving them quick enough die to halbreds. We all went red, alot of us died in the end, because 15 guys can't take 60 RP'rs very pissed off. 1 hour after this is over, the RP'r that started it posts on COB complaining how we ruined his RP experience by going out of charcter. Hello? He did it by insulting us and died. What do you expect pirates to do to you? He pissed and moaned all night (this was like at 2 AM). The next day some RP'rs congradulated us on keeping in character while fighting them and giving them a fun event and good loot for those that survived. Really made that one RP'r complaining at us for ruining his experience look bad. Too bad the guy got mad for beeing made a fool of, cause he was friends with a GM and half of us got banned for 'harassment'. Though most got unbanned because of a few emails and witnesses from the fight..
<P>Don't call me a 'kEwLd00d' without knowing me and then tell me to grow up.
