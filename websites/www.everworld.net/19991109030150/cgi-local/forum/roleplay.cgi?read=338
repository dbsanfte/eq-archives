<P>*The sea captain, now finishing his three minute explanation of ocean travel, points at the main mast rigging with a trembling hand, explaining it's importance. Snapping his mouth shut once through, he looks at Fen with wide eyes, his other hand gripping the wheel with white knuckles.*

<P>*Nodding, Fen spares a look over his shoulder and sees that the barbarians hadn't climbed the plank aboard ship. Glancing down the shore, he saw that neither Gradnon nor Trescar were anywhere in sight along the docks or the beach. For a moment, he felt almost sad. They'd been good fellas. Fine travelling companions they would have made, no doubt. But they had their own path to travel and he had his. For some reason, Fen had a feeling he would meet the two brothers again somewhere down the road, but he also knew it wouldn't be any time soon...*
<P>"Well!" Fen musters, turning from the captain to face the others, "Seems this barge only need a captain and two crewmen to make her sea worthy, so I guess that mean you and me, bastard." Pointing to Cathal, Fen cocks his thumb at the little man behind the wheel. "Seems this fellas old crew jumped ship when we all came hackin' and slashin' our way on board. Can't say I blame 'em."
<P>*Hearing something odd (something like someone babbling a whole sentence out in one long word vomit), Fen does a quick full circle, then scratches his stubble, looking suspiciously at the deckhouse. After a moment, he waves it off and shrugs.*
<P>"Ah, what the hell, anyways..."
