<P>i have been an avid player of UO since it first came out and before i almost closed my UO account to play EQ instead, they came out w/ the chaos server...no for those of you who did't play UO when they had the abyss server out, this is what it did: you pick your gender then just pick some class(didn't matter which one as i will explain), then start the game - you start in the main city in which there are 3 gates for your stats and about 50 or so gates for skills (one gate per skill) - now each of these would raise you skill or stat to it's max level so in effect you'd be at level 50 of whatever class you decided to play - the only problem w/ this server is the fact that everyone left all the other servers and camp to this one so it was always packed - heh - anyway - i really would love to see something like a chaos server - where everyone started a new char. which would start out at 50th level w/ no exp loss on death (so you'd never go below 50th level) - this server was just a blast in UO and best of all i didn't worry about dying at all - if someone killed me, which happened so much i couldn't count, i just went and killed a few things (which was very easy at 50th level) and went back and bought some new styff and went rite back into the fray - one other thing, this would be a great place to find out which class could use some tweaking and also find out if you really are going to like playing a class once you hit 50 - it'd really suck to get that ranger up to level 50 on a regualr server and not like it as much as you thought you would

<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=70 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; i have been an avid player of UO since it first came out and 
&gt; before i almost closed my UO account to play EQ instead, they 
&gt; came out w/ the chaos server...no for those of you who did't 
&gt; play UO when they had the abyss server out, this is what it did: 
&gt; you pick your gender then just pick some class(didn't matter 
&gt; which one as i will explain), then start the game - you start in 
&gt; the main city in which there are 3 gates for your stats and 
&gt; about 50 or so gates for skills (one gate per skill) - now each 
&gt; of these would raise you skill or stat to it's max level so in 
&gt; effect you'd be at level 50 of whatever class you decided to 
&gt; play - the only problem w/ this server is the fact that everyone 
&gt; left all the other servers and camp to this one so it was always 
&gt; packed - heh - anyway - i really would love to see something 
&gt; like a chaos server - where everyone started a new char. which 
&gt; would start out at 50th level w/ no exp loss on death (so you'd 
&gt; never go below 50th level) - this server was just a blast in UO 
&gt; and best of all i didn't worry about dying at all - if someone 
&gt; killed me, which happened so much i couldn't count, i just went 
&gt; and killed a few things (which was very easy at 50th level) and 
&gt; went back and bought some new styff and went rite back into the
