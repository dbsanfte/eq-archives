<P>Because the game is fun, interesting. Well put together. The interface is userfriendly. It promotes group support and cooperation. It helps you to add something to the world of Norrath. Helps you to be a part of something that's growing constantly. It allows you to go out, make friends all over the world, talk to them, role play with them, adventure with them. See new things and do things that most other Online games don't necessarily allow you to do. It lets you create a Character, build reputations with one side while destroying your standing with another there by making certain you always have a "rep" to uphold. If you don't want to kill other players, you don't have to, and you don't have to worry about them doing so. Almost everyone I've talked to in the game has been friendly, helpful, and supportive while yer getting off yer feet. There's a few exceptions, strangly..a paladin is one of them. And he's not even after my necromancer, but my bard of all things. There's always gonna be the exception mind you. You can try different things, yer not limited to one character or another. you can go out, create, as I have, a Necromancer, a Ranger, a Bard, and a Mage, or any other combination you want. You can play a Huge Troll or a Giant Ogre, or a small, very small, halflinf, gnome or Dwarf, even try to get a date with a Dwarven female with a...beard. That's still way wrong. And, if that's all still not enough.

<P>You get to kill Monsters!!!!! LOTS OF EM!! ALL THE TIME!!! EVERYWHERE!! or, you get to be killed by Monsters! LOTS OF EM!!! ALL THE TIME!!! EVERYWHERE!!! Painful, but fun.
