<P>I was just on the pvp server and 3 trolls by the name of daboo, ogglethump, and zaratul looted some guy and then tried to blame it on me! I was walking by and they sit and blame it on me! So I yell to the zone that these guys are losers and should be killed ( would have done it myself but died 15 minutes earlier and lost the last weapon i could barely afford) but no one beleived me so I just quit playing the character. Had to had no money to recover and no trade skills to make money. I had previously lost all my stuff before the last time i lost all my stuff. Anyways how can you people sleep at night? You say it's just a game and your absolutely right it is and i spent 18 damn hours on that charcter only to have to quit because you pricks wanted the 2 gp from selling my weapon! It's not the game it's the time lost and the fact that all I wanna do is have a good time playing this game and all you wanna do is prevent it for no other reason than the fact that your a total loser. BTW when are they going to fix this HORRIBLE loot your body bug on the pvp????? Can it really be that hard??? Take 2 guys and throw them on it for an hour, tada!!!
