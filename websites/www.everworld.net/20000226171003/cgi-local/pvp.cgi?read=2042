<P>Knowing the guy that is mentioned in these "quotes" of yours I can almost tell you what happened even though I wasn't there myself. Sky is with the Pluggers, and Pluggers don't take defeat to well. They die and do the time dispised "Naked Wizard rush". I shit you not when I tell you that you could be stuck fighting their naked, long since legit killed walking corpses for hours. So what is the one thing to deter them from doing this? XP loss, pure and simple. If this case it would appear that he died to drowning several times and not to any DoT spell, which has been fixed. So yes if people try this lame ass crap we will train with mobs or what ever it takes to make you lose XP, you waste our time, we will waste more of yours.

<P>With the kind of hate we seem to inspire out of some of our victims, we are forced to take extreme measures. Now again, these are people that were LEGIT killed, and they are exploiting weaknesses in the system to waste our in game time. The pluggers have been busted on more than one occasion for exploiting and harassing players, namely CC, including myself. These tactics are reserved for the true assholes who don't know when to give up. We tolerate the few "naked wizard rushes", but thats the limit. One night I had Horizon of the pluggers die and come back fighting within 60 sec of death no less that 20 times, and then procede to exploit a line of sight bug in everfrost to kill me. He was busted for exploiting and harassment by a GM. This typical though for members of his guild. One night we had some newbie training NPC's and monsters on us in E karana, so when he trained we would root him and watch him die. This retard even said he knew he would lose XP, but to kill us he was willing to risk it. This is what we have to deal with every single day. So if someone abuses us we damn sure will defend ourselves with what ever means our neccesary. We generally on have to resort to these tactics if GM's or guides arn't on, which tends to be frequent.
<P>Please consider the possibility that there are more assholes as you say, than just us. If people aren't lame to us, then we arn't assholes to them.
<P>&gt; CC Never intentionally kills someone using DOT or to make them
<BR>&gt; lose experience? Nice, try Seomun; I'm not jumping on the
<BR>&gt; bandwagon, I was THERE when it went on, and watched and listened
<BR>&gt; to the activity. Maybe you weren't there, and YOU are the one
<BR>&gt; who needs to do some research about what kinds of assholes you
<BR>&gt; have in your guild and who you support at the drop of a hat.
<BR>&gt; Unfortunately, you're wrong this time. These are all nearly
<BR>&gt; direct quotes from the members of your guild who "never
<BR>&gt; intentionally killed someone with DOT or to make them lose
<BR>&gt; exp:"
<P>&gt; "Yeah, come on back Sky, you're becoming the master of
<BR>&gt; drowning!"
<BR>&gt; "You have become better at drowning! (125)"
<BR>&gt; "There goes another bar of exp."
<BR>&gt; "How much exp have you lost so far, Sky?"
<BR>&gt; "Have you lost another level yet?"
<BR>&gt; "You are really getting good at swimming around in the
<BR>&gt; river and falling off the world."
<BR>&gt; "Don't worry about Sky, he's just pissed because he's lost
<BR>&gt; 10 hours worth of exp to us."
<P>&gt; These are the words of people who are doing this
<BR>&gt; unintentionally? Whatever Seomun. YOU do your research before
<BR>&gt; you propose to tell me what I do and do not know. Not all
<BR>&gt; players are as stupid as the ones you guys bully around.
