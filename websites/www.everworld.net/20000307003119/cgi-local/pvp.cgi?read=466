<P>

<BR>Well thanks for your wellworded commentary on the viewpoint of the -PvP player. Unfortunately, our discussion here is really not about how to force PvP onto the unsuspecting role players and kind hearted denizens of Norrath. What we are dealing with is how to make PvP work in Everquest.
<P>The fact that there is a PvP switch is set in stone. PvP will be voluntary. Moving on from there we have a lengthy list of issues to resolve before PvP becomes an option in EQ. The current state of affairs is that about 90% of the PvP community (that I'm in contact with at least) gave up on EQ because they don't think PvP is viable, not because of the PvP switch. We hope that this forum will help us, the PvP community, illustrate to Verant why it is not so and how it can be changed to win back our share of the market. The PvP Server is a two fold effort as I see it. First, it puts alot of PvP players together into their own community so it is easier to find others to fight with. Second, it removes a lot of PvP players from the other servers which many -PvP players think is a good thing.
<P>No need to worry. The world of Norrath is completely safe from the teenage c00l d00dz, the voluntary PvP system saw to that. Now lets set aside the tired cliche's, d00d references, and PK bashing and see if we can get Verant to deliver a workable PvP system before it is (for us) too late.
<P>&gt; I have a few comments.
<P>&gt; First I have to congratulate most of you on the lucidity and
<BR>&gt; inteligence with which you express your opinions. That said, I
<BR>&gt; see most of these posts as a thinly disguised lament to
<BR>&gt; "logic" Verant into making EQ accessible to open PvP.
<BR>&gt; It appears that you, all of you, just cannot stand the idea that
<BR>&gt; given the choice most people on EQ have opted NOT to PvP and
<BR>&gt; that the "switch" is such an insurmountable deterrent
<BR>&gt; to what you consider fun.
<P>&gt; Funny that even though you will have gotten your own EQ PvP
<BR>&gt; server it does not seem enough - you want to "force"
<BR>&gt; us all to accept some sort of PvP on every server, a scenario
<BR>&gt; which means that our choice not to PvP at all disappears.
<P>&gt; Not very sensitive of you is it?
<P>&gt; As it stands now EQ has given us the +PvP / -PvP choice in the
<BR>&gt; best way they know of and that choice has been embraced by well
<BR>&gt; over ninety five opercent of the EQ players thus far. Why do you
<BR>&gt; find this impossible to accept? Why are you not satisfied with
<BR>&gt; the abiliity kill each other and leave us alone?
<P>&gt; Of course there are times when I have wished for the ability to
<BR>&gt; off some idiot who is being a pain but by in large I am more
<BR>&gt; than happy to have to forego that "pleasure" for the
<BR>&gt; serenity to be able to role play and explore without worrying
<BR>&gt; about being jumped by twenty homicidal maniacs during my strolls
<BR>&gt; or losing that which I have worked so hard to obtain.
<P>&gt; There is, despite your protestations and suggestions, no extant
<BR>&gt; way of regulating PvP. No matter how this has been tried all
<BR>&gt; such attempts have been futile, ending up in the dreaded
<BR>&gt; generation of PvP "gang-bangers" who suffer no real
<BR>&gt; loss of anything worthwhile while having the ability to kill
<BR>&gt; anyone moving, newbies being a special treat. No matter what the
<BR>&gt; restriction some clever person has always found a way to
<BR>&gt; circumvent it - until the "switch". You might even say
<BR>&gt; that the failure of +PvPs to police or restrain themselves
<BR>&gt; whatsoever on anything like a global scale in previous games led
<BR>&gt; to your own downfall.
<P>&gt; If I want to fight someone I can always challenge them to duel.
<BR>&gt; This is fair and reasonable. If they don't respond - well - then
<BR>&gt; I guess I was the better man so to speak. In this way may I
<BR>&gt; point out that you CAN fight anyone of any level and I see the
<BR>&gt; anti-level restriction comments as nothing more than a thinly
<BR>&gt; disguised attempt to institute open player hunting on EQ,
<BR>&gt; something that I hope never comes about.
<P>&gt; I respect your opinions ladies and gentlemen PvPs but you
<BR>&gt; already have an RPG where you can pretty much kill to your
<BR>&gt; hearts content despite the efforts of the designers to limit it
<BR>&gt; and we do not yet have the opposite opportunity.
<P>&gt; Face it. EQ is, for the forseeable future, going to stay exactly
<BR>&gt; the way it is until and unless the game flops badly enough in
<BR>&gt; commercial release to force Verant into a decision to open it to
<BR>&gt; PvP without a choice. The only choice that you now have however,
<BR>&gt; is to accept this or move to the PvP server.
<P>&gt; We -PvPs have played by "your rules" for too long. Now
<BR>&gt; you'll have to play by oours for awhile. Interesting isn't it?
<BR>&gt; The whining so long the openly derided province of the -PvP has
<BR>&gt; now shifted to the +PvP group. If you meant half what you've
<BR>&gt; said in the past you'll accept this and move on to play the game
<BR>&gt; as it is designed. If not -- well perhaps you are not really all
<BR>&gt; that tolerant, accepting and the all around good sports you used
<BR>&gt; to tell us WE should be when the shoe was on the other foot.
<P>&gt; Play the game. If it is not fun for you then show your distaste
<BR>&gt; by not playing the game, but as you once told us -PvPs, grow up
<BR>&gt; and accept what now is.
<P>&gt; Respectfully,
<P>&gt; Warsword Keenblade
