<P>

<BR>A few problems I obseved that still remain:
<P>#1 You are in a group fighting a monster. One of your team mates needs healing and you target them to cast a spell and WHACK you hit them because you are in auto-attack mode and all of you are RED. Members of the same group should not be able to hit one another or damage each other with spells.
<P>#2 If you use a racial hiding skill you cannot tell if you have succeeded. Your character dissapears from your own point of view, but observers may or may not see you. I noticed that with four of us trying hiding, at one point I could see character B but another player could not see character B, so hiding is also relative to each individual. I would prefer if hiding was either success or failure, and that you knew whether or not you had succeeded. Otherwise the skill is only of use as a curioisity as I won't stake my life on using it. At the very least if another player obsevers me hide successfully, then other players that happen across me should not be able to see me.
<P>#3 The guards in Mysty Thcket still get stuck back in the tunnel leading to Rivervale on a regular basis, leaving the newbies in the zone to fend for themselves.
<P>#4 Red PvP players that die to a mob are still lootable by other players, even though you receive a message that you cannot loot this player, you are still able to remove an item from their inventory as well as all of their coins. This looting condition should only be in effect when another red PvP player has done a majority of the overall damage to that player.
