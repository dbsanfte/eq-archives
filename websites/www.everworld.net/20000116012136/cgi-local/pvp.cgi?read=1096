<P>>

<BR>ALL the experiences I have had with this looting thing have been bad. I don't even think that you should have exp loss when looting someone you did not kill I simply think that if you don't kill em , you aint lootin em. The equipment based classes suffer a LOT more then you pure magic users. Even with the exp loss, lets say I am a low level whatever and I am out wandering around the karanas and I see a level 18 get killed by a hg, well I run over there and low and behold he has a peice of chain mail on him. You better believe I'm taking the exp loss and it gonna be nutin compared to the loss of his 36 plat and the super advancement to mine.
<BR>With no +- level limit to pking, I agree there shouldn't and if they don't fix the magic resist and what have you when fighting a 1 or 2 level higher character that idea may be bad but it seems like it is our only option. If they manage to water it down enough I am okay with it. With the exp loss of killing a below 4 level character I don't know about this. If you have a bunch of cheezy killers out there who are killin everyone in the zone, then the whole zone comes together and whoops em( seen it happen). But then again I cannot foresee how bad it might get so I say we play it safe and go with the blacks idere here.
<BR>On the killing of your own kind I have a different twist to that. Upon killing your own kind(given that your within 4 levels) you become a betrayer to your race and other races are simply neutral towards you. Upon killing 2 of your own kind other races will like you. ( some are prob thinking it should be more but we dont want a lot of same race killing , in fact it might be better to leave it at 1 kill) You will be able to live amongst the other races. Example I am a barbarian and kill a barbarian now the dark elves, ogres, and trolls like me. Here is the two catches #1 you cant just run over to neriak, whack a few d elves and then run back to halas a smilin. In fact I don't think you should be able to turn back as people will abuse the system no matter what the number.( he betrays the barbs, because he hates the barb he killed, runs over to neriak and kills his newbie buddy 20 times until the barbs like him again). #2 once you betray an option is brought up and you can choose where to be 'bound' to, such as oggok, grobb, or neriak, or vice versa of course.
<BR>In order for this to work once you betray ALL of the opposing side has to like you. This may or may not be implementable but would be extremely fun and even up the race wars for sure which is why I suggested it in the first place.
<BR>My next point is on travcel amongst the dark races. It is damn near impossible for a d elf to run thru all the zones includin oasis mind you to get to grobb and then party with them there. All the other races get to team up with there allies very easily. Dwarves and elves, humans and barbs or erudites the list goes on. My suggestion here has already been posted and CAN easily be implemented and would be very cool at the same time. Have an underground boat from neriak to grobb and back! Wouldn't that solve that prob and be sweet at the same time? And the zones like south desert of ro and such would still be used as the have orcs and good creatures to fight at certain levels.
<BR>The problem I see is that the dark races even with the boat are limited to this continent. We can never get to erudia because the boat is in the middle of qeynos! Yes we can with invis but thats self only in most cases and organizing that would well be near impossible so I suggest land bridges or an evil boat to both continents and to the other 2 continents if they are going to be in game.
<BR>With the dark races mingling and traitors joining and leaving the pvp server would simply be the funnest thing on gods green earth:)
<P>Novandamis
<P>The idea of taking an experience point hit when you kill outside
<BR>&gt; your factions has some merit. Eventually I think being unable to
<BR>&gt; use your own home town will prove a detriment, but this is an
<BR>&gt; additional penalty that makes some sense.
<P>&gt; It *could*, and I stress could, be a replacement for the
<BR>&gt; moratorium on killing below the 4 level range limit. If a player
<BR>&gt; for example were to kill someone more than 4 levels below, they
<BR>&gt; could suffer a big XP hit, at least 1 bubble (20%) if not more.
<BR>&gt; In this way you could still deal with truly annoying players,
<BR>&gt; but it would cost you a great deal to do so. For the vast
<BR>&gt; majority of players the threat of losing a bubble of XP would be
<BR>&gt; enough deterrent to keep them from killing weak players. Those
<BR>&gt; that repeatedly violated this would soon find their characters
<BR>&gt; reduced to newbie levels. Still it smacks of the UO system of
<BR>&gt; blue pking where you can go wax some monsters for a couple
<BR>&gt; hours, then go out and kill a weak player, then go wax some
<BR>&gt; monsters... If the penalty is stiff enough it could work. You
<BR>&gt; would need some sort of toggle or warning so that a player did
<BR>&gt; not accidentally attack a weaker, possibly the weak player
<BR>&gt; hilights in yellow to warn a would be attacker that they are
<BR>&gt; going to take a hit to XP if they kill that individual.
<P>&gt; I am going to ignore the rest of the posters suggestions that we
<BR>&gt; implement a UO notoriety and PKing/murder flagging system in
<BR>&gt; Everquest. They have no place here and are not needed.
