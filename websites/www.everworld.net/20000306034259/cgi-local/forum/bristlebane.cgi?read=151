<P>I have seen what happens on the test server when it was a RaceWar server. My brother plays on it all the time. People get killed because they cannot find anybody to party with. These are the people that are just better off not PvP. It is sad to see a group of 10 low-level dark elfs kill a higher level human and then camp by his body. When he comes back they will just kill him. then they shout that he is a pussy. that is just plain stupidity. these guys are the pussies. 10-1 is not a good ratio. I think that you should be safe to explore other parts of the world without getting jumped and always bieng paranoid. that ruined that guys night of playing. I think that this kind of thing should not happen. I think if everyone had a good attitude about it and there were defined enemies ( so you would not get attacked by someone in your group..) then it would be cool. I have seen a high level get into a group of unsuspecting guys wanting to hunt at the bandit camp and then he waits till they are all beaten up a little and then finishes them off. this creates a lot of hostility and makes everybody want to kill everybody.. You dont get anything for killing people. Just the thrill of saying that you killed someone because they were helpless. If you wanna kill someone play quake 2. Some people just want to go in and fight along with people and have a good time gaining levels and looting. I personally would like to be PvP but there is not anybody else that wants to, and that is fine. I enjoy the game like it is....If you wanna be PvP there is a server for it. Bristlebane is supposed to be people that all get along. That is what the servers description says. That we are all outgoing and party and things like that.

<P>that is just my opinion though.
