<P>After many, many moons our Order has been concieved. Brought down from the skies by our collective might and wills, the great wyrm known as Verant fell from the skies before us and a pact was made. Many a mage and priest were lost. Knights fell alongside the rangers they had sparred with as a child. Our victory, though just and well deserved, was a costly blow to the forces of good. We looked after our fallen allies, our perished friends, in the manner which honored them best and proceeded to assess the damage done. Of our great numbers, less than a score survived our battle with the wyrm. Too many were lost.

<BR>As such, we seek an influx of new blood. We seek any who can wield the arts of the arcane and those who control the very elements. We seek those noble warriors who have been blessed with magics either by the church, or by the forests. Of all these, we seek only those who have chosen to play out the roles set before us by the gods. Those who would seek out the destruction of all that is vile and unholy. Those who are pure of soul, of spirt, and who are noble of deed.
<P>We shall gather our numbers once more. We shall bring a sense of goodness back to the people. We shall enjoy the comraderie of old friends. And we shall make war upon the children of Innoruk and the followers of the dark gods.
<P>If you possess these traits (magics, honor, goodness, and the desire to play out your role in this land) peruse our scrolls and seek us out. You need but touch the runes at the end of this missive and our words will appear. As you walk the lands of Norrath, seek out myself, my dear friend Fyndolyn, or any of our number for further information.
