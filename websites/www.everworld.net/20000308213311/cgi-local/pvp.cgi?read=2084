<P>> I recently talked to a high lvl warrior (lvl 29) and i gathered

<BR>&gt; some interesting info off of him about high lvl PvP-ing. he
<BR>&gt; feels that at high lvls the real masters of PvP are not the
<BR>&gt; wizards or other Int based casters its acctually wisdom based
<BR>&gt; casters. thats right shamans, clerics and druids of which he
<BR>&gt; said clerics are by far the best. he watched a fight between a
<BR>&gt; cleric and a wizard the wiz rooted the cleric and proceeded to
<BR>&gt; blast this guy to oblivion.. cept that the cleric had such a
<BR>&gt; high resistence to magic combined with a high wisdom that he
<BR>&gt; resisted nearly half of the total spells cast on him! the cleric
<BR>&gt; just stood there healing himself. the damage taken and the
<BR>&gt; damage given were almost identical.. the wiz then ran out of
<BR>&gt; mana and sat down to med only by this time the root wore off and
<BR>&gt; the cleric closed in and started to swing his big heavy hammer
<BR>&gt; into this wimpy little wizard. the wiz was forced to flee and
<BR>&gt; the cleric then blinded him and struck him down with melee and
<BR>&gt; magic. he won the fight THEN the cleric healed up and cast a
<BR>&gt; spell on the wizards corpse and low and behold the naked wizard
<BR>&gt; poped up next to his body and the cleric proceeded to beat the
<BR>&gt; smack out of this guy again. this went on until the wizard
<BR>&gt; finnaly just disconnected.
<P>This one sounds like a story. While the first part sounds about right, there is no way a cleric has the mana to outheal a wizard, res him and kill him repeatedly with magic/melee. Healing for a cleric is very mana efficient...offensive magic is not.
<P>Resist as well does a lot less for reducing damamge than level advantage does. With 116 cold resist a wizard friend cast frost shock on me to test. I didnt resist even partially a single time and we were both the same level.
<P>At level 30 (druid) I fought a level 34 cleric. He ended up running after wasting his mana on offensive magic.
<P>At high levels the melee classes equipped with journeymen boots become far more effective. They are unrootable and you can no long kite them.
<P>And you're right about the bards....one on one...they are damn near unkillable.
<P>Lan
<P>&gt; next off he saw a fight between a druid and a mage. the mage
<BR>&gt; evidently was sitting a zone line and the druid popped out
<BR>&gt; avoiding a train. the mage had his pet start to attack him and
<BR>&gt; started to blast him with DD spells. the druid cast a DoT spell
<BR>&gt; on the mage... then started to heal himself. and pet didnt him
<BR>&gt; that much and the mage started to run out of mana so he ran..
<BR>&gt; the druid cast SoW on himself and ran off after the guy hitting
<BR>&gt; him with his staff completly ignoring the pet. my friend doesnt
<BR>&gt; know how this one turned out but the druid obviously had the
<BR>&gt; advantage when they left.
<P>&gt; one last thought, this one my own. the most survivable (most
<BR>&gt; able to not be PKed) has got to be the bard. he is un-rootable,
<BR>&gt; he has DD songs that do not require mana and can interupt a
<BR>&gt; caster, a bard that is able to kite cannot be caught or killed.
<BR>&gt; the only way to kill an experienced bard is to kill em when they
<BR>&gt; are low on health, very low.
<P>&gt; thoughts, comments?
