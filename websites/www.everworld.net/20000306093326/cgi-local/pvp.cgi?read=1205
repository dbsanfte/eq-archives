<P>This is taken from an interview with Brad Mcquaid and PC ign:

<P>BM: Several ways, really. First, the PK switch which
<P>allows players to choose whether they want to be
<P>involved in Player vs. Player combat is turning out to
<P>be a HUGE success. We launched Phase 4 with 5
<P>regular servers and one unrestricted PvP server. So far,
<P>less than five percent of Phase 4 testers have chosen to
<P>play on the PvP server, and the majority are choosing to
<P>play non-PK on the regular servers. Clearly, the players
<P>have spoken loud and clear on this issue. Also,
<P>EverQuest is a very group oriented game. We allow the
<P>players to form groups and guilds, and to share
<P>experience and loot, and to communicate globally. By
<P>creating a more cooperative game, players are finding
<P>both the need and desire to work together with others
<P>and not just perceive another player as a target or a
<P>victim. It’s really refreshing to see.
<P>This sound crpytically like they're will not be a PvP server in the final. I would like to point out before sony makes this desicion that they're were many new testers in phase 4 (the majority), and most of them probably dont know enough about the game to start out on the PvP server. Also many people who could not move their charcs from phase 3 to the pvp who did not want to start over did not go to the pvp server who might have otherwise, and finally if you have 90,000 people in the final of EQ, you will have enough players, more then enough players to fill up a pvp server. So I implore with anyone at 989 to please have one for the final. If their is not one pvp in EQ will essentially die out because all the pvp kind will be spread out between all the other servers, and it just wont be that fun. I know personally I and many other people in my guild will not be partaking in EQ unless their is one, and Im sure a lot of other people who play on the beloved PvP server feel the same way.
