<P>Okay I have played both a sk and a paladin and have come to this conclusion. Everything about both of them is perfect except for a few spells on the sk side of the battle. In regards to 'trademark' spells ( such as the clerics minor, lesser, and healing, or the wizards burn spells or necro's life suck spells, i refer to as 'trademark' spells) the paladin has all of the clerics trademark spells such as minor healing, courage cure poison, yaulp, which are pretty much all the good or i should say most used spells from that spell level, yes there are others he has that are good but this isn't my point. My point is on the other side of the fence the sk doesn't get a 'trademark' spell untiul level 22, vampiric embrace. I realize that they get a summon pet spell but that doesn't happen until level 15 and he gets the level 8 necro spell bone walk. So tell me when I am fightin a level 12 to 16 creature when I am level 15 how much good do you think that level 8 or 9 skel is gonna do? Some of you are saying well he might hit them and do a little damage or take a little bit of the heat off me but what happens when I am level 21 ( i dont get different spells until level 22) and I have a level 8 or 9 skel, well I dont even have to say it. Sorry if my post comes off argumentative I just dont want people to try and argue that I am wrong. The point of my post is to suggest that the sk for sure be given lifetap at level 9 instead of some less used spell like sense the dead or what have you and at level 15 be given lifespike instead of fear or numb dead or whatever. The next suggestion is that 1 of 2 things happen with pets and sk's as they are very near worthless now. #1 the level 8 bone walk at 15 become the level 12 convoke shadow( at least the pet is closer to your level for a little while:( and so on or #2 the sk be given beef up offensively spells (like the shaman inner fire and such)instead of summon pet spells because the pala has all of the best beef up defensively spells that the cleric gets such as courage at 9, holy armor at 15 and center at 22. Or they could simply give the sk minor eilding, lesser sheilding , and stuff like that. As it stands in my eyes the sk is noticeably weaker in the spells area than the paladin. I would like more than a agree or disagree post from the board. I would like to hear a response from someone who could possibly change this and tell me why that they arent doing it IF the answer is no. Or someone like geiger or the black who has actual contact with the gm's. THX a million guys.
