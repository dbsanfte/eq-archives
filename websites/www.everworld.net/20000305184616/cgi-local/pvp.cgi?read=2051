<P>I'm 99% positive that the Rallos Zek server was not set up so that pkers could find hurting single hunters or groups of hurting characters and pk/loot them. I don't know where you people come from, but that attitude is ruining the RZ server for most people interested in RPing conflicts. A big part of the game is supposed to be finding challenging things to hunt to get loot and xp, but now we've also got small hordes of people running around in hunting areas where they can't even gain xp but can still slaughter/loot weakened characters and turn invisible/hide/zone/log when the heat turns up. The new hunter's creed for the first 10 levels or so is: Don't hunt anything that can hurt you because there's always someone hiding right behind you waiting to slit your throat for your coin, valuables and/or just the fun of ruining your last 2-3+ hours (+ earning enough to replace chain or steel weapons can take many victims a good 20 hours) of xp work. "Work"? Yes - building a tough character is fun and rewarding, but it also takes work, moreso when you have to repeat it without being able to fight the higher yielding and more challenging critters.

<BR>I know that killing lesser characters, weakened characters and class-handicapped characters (non-spellcasters; even groups of them, are pretty much sitting ducks vs hit-and-run inviso-opportunists at lower levels at least) is a great and easy way to make money for your other "real" characters. But that isn't what PVP was meant to be about; it's just PKing and there is a difference. Some people play fine murderers/muggers/gang-punks/etc. and I have no real problems with them as a player. My problem is with those people who pick their class, race and hunting area just for the early opportunities it gives them to kill, harrass and loot other players (and especially with those who just do it to transfer their money + items to another character of sparkling virtue).
<BR>I've never brought this up in the game, and my 7th level ranger who's been pk'd/attacked 11 times by 5 different characters (3 necros, 2 I'm-not-sure-whats) within the last 4 days has no words for those who have picked convenient moments to murder him. But as a player who recognizes that this pattern of behavior is only getting worse as the server life progresses, I just have to get my 2¢ out there. With a little more common sense and maturity all around, this server could be great.
<BR>The best game-mechanic-involved ideas I've heard for fixing this problem on this server would be a bounty system (no interfence by certain guards; no 4-level restriction for apprehensions) and big faction hits for certain kinds of PKings.
