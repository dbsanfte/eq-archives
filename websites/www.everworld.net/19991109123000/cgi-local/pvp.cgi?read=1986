<P>> Well, I can say this with certainty. If you are a nice person

<BR>&gt; who wants to play EQ to enjoy the game and do a little adven-
<BR>&gt; turing then Rallos Zek is not for you. In fact, if you are
<BR>&gt; the kind of person that enjoys playing the game and wants to
<BR>&gt; have fun adventuring around Norrath then dont play on Zek. In
<BR>&gt; that case, Rallos Zek is the worst server you can play on.
<P>I've been wanting to respond to this story for two days now, ever
<BR>since I read it on EQVault. Unfortunately, for some odd reason, I
<BR>keep getting randomly banned from posting on any board there -- lucky for you, else I'd have torched you royally by now.
<P>I'm a nice person who wants to do some adventuring. I enjoy playing
<BR>the game because I enjoy adventuring around Norrath. I'm exactly the
<BR>kind of player you say shouldn't play on Rallos Zek. But I'll tell
<BR>you now, I wouldn't even think of playing on a non-PvP server. So,
<BR>please drop the "I can say with certainty" line, because it's simply
<BR>wrong -- you honestly don't know what the hell you're talking about. I've met more cool people on Zek than bad ones, done a LOT of cool roleplaying, had some FUN-AS-HELL PvP fights (unlike UO, where I was
<BR>always outclassed) & have enjoyed the hell out of the server.
<P>&gt; The other day I was Afk for a matter of minutes outside of
<BR>&gt; Befallen and of course was immediately attacked.
<P>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<BR>What, in the name of the Blessed Spires, were you doing AFK in that
<BR>area????? Even if you were hidden, or invisible, that is simply not a
<BR>place to be la-de-dahing around in. That was asking to be jumped, &
<BR>you got what you asked for. IMHO, this was one of the more laughable
<BR>portions of your story -- I can't believe you were that dumb, & expect
<BR>the rest of us to sympathize with you. Personally, I'm ashamed that
<BR>you call yourselves Teir'Dal; we aren't supposed to be weak & lazing
<BR>about like that, out of the Sheltering Darkness, anyway.
<P>&gt; You see, when these scumbags realized we were afk and not fighting
<BR>&gt; back, they decided to attack.
<P>How did they know you were "AFK & not fighting back", if they hadn't
<BR>attacked yet? Am I missing something here?
<P>As for their cowardice -- well, of course they're cowards. They are,
<BR>after all, killers. Their use of a DOT spell on you is inexcusable,
<BR>given that they all knew it was illegal, but other than that, they
<BR>did exactly what I would have. The bottom line, Keira, is this: you
<BR>were stupid, you left yourself wide open, & you got ganked for it; because of that, you then go whining about it on THREE DIFFERENT
<BR>MESSAGE BOARDS (& that's just what I know of) -- how you're leaving, & how Rallos Zek is the "world of sociopaths", & how no-one that's
<BR>here to role-play should be playing on Zek, & this & that & yada yada yada. Then, you go & admit that you never said you were leaving
<BR>permanently, which, frankly, pretty much destroyed your credibility.
<BR>If you're not leaving permanently, then the incident wasn't as bad as
<BR>you claimed, & if it wasn't as bad as you claimed, then you had no
<BR>business fouling the air with your complaints.
