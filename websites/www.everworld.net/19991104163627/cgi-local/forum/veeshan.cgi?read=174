<P>"Lines In the Sand", Written by Solflexion of Akalabeth

<P><blockquote><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">It had been a downpour throughout the commonlands all day, but now that night loomed.. the rain had stopped, leaving the air heavy and damp. The kind or air that weighed in your lungs like you were breathing water. The rain water poured off the northern mountains in small waterfalls, catching the last rays from the descending sun.<p>The brown cloaked figure's mood seemed to mirror his surroundings, slowly fading to black. He walked purposefully toward the mountains, staff in hand.. helping him catch his balance in the fresh mud. As he neared the wall of rock and rounded a boulder, the face of the mountains seemed to open up before him.. a gaping, forbidding maw. A bat squealed and flew across the coming night sky, now blue as the sun struggled to maintain it's grasp on Norrath... to no avail. Night was here, and those that revel in the dark began to stir.<p>The figure stopped in the valley and sat on a rock, waiting patiently as the night darkened. When the last rays of the sun faded, and the moon took up it's sentry position.. his appointment arrived. The moonlight did not reach the valley, making the night seem pitch black, so the figure did not see his appointment arrive.. but he knew he was there. The black robed figure stepped forward silently.. and sat next to the brown garbed man. They sat and stared across the valley, at the blackness ahead of them.. contemplating each other's thought's, as if they were simply reading each other's minds. So different they were in so many ways.. the blue skinned black robed figure was nearly half the size of the dark skinned brown robed man in stature.. but size did not mean much, as both of these beings wielded magiks more powerful than most knew of. <p>It was the blue skinned one who broke the silence first.. 'Hello, Solflexion'<p>'Greetings, Lochedahnan' the brown man replied.<p>They sat in silence a bit longer.. almost hesitant to speak to eachother.. then Solf asked 'So why do you request this meeting, my friend. It is unlike you to seem so unnerved.'<p>'I am not unnerved, just thoughtful of recent stirrings within our guild... and I felt that I must discuss this with you. I need to know where you stand, should the lines be drawn'<p>'Lines? Perhaps you should explain.' Solf replied.<p>Loche continued 'There seems to be a growing faction that does not ... 'approve' of those of us in the guild with 'darker intentions'. They are just a whisper of discontent now.. but in my experience, such whispers are soon to become the booming voices that are associated with crusades. I am not worried, I have weathered such storms before, and will do so again.. but I ask you, friend, should someone drop this gauntlet.. where do you stand?'<p>Solf thought for a minute, still staring at the wall.. and replied 'I know of these whispers you speak of, and I agree that they will lead to conflict. I am also suprised that you would need to ask me this question, knowing all we have been through together.<p>'I am not one to leave anything to chance' Loche replied.<p>Solf grinned into the darkness .. 'of course not, I should know that by now. Rest assured my friend, I will stand by you and your right to practice your craft in the manner that you choose. I care not for the virtues that you live by, for in the end, we all have to answer to our own god, and we all do what we must to win favor. You do what you must, Lochedahnan, and I will fight for your right to do so, politically and otherwise.'<p>'I am glad to hear that, Solflexion, I believed you would feel that way.. but I needed to make sure. If push comes to shove, I had to know you had my back.' <p>'For what is a Necromancer to me, but an Enchanter of the dead?' Solf asked.<p>Loche answered 'And what is an Enchanter to me but a Necromancer of the inorganic?'<p>They both smiled into the darkness, knowing that as different as they were... there were likenesses, and a bond that was undeniable.<p>'Enough talk of the future, and things that may or may not come to pass.' Solf said,'Let us live in the present right now.. I suggest we take advantage of our impromptu meeting... I hear that there is a Dervish camp in Northern Ro that has just come into possession of an entire crate of Kaladimian Whiskey...'<p> Loche grinned 'Indeed? then I suggest we make haste.. or some unworthy heathens may beat us to our prize'<p>'Once again, your thoughts mirror my own' Solf replied.<p>And the two made their way silently out into the night, as they had so many times before, with purpose.<p>Poor dervs.<hr><b>Info:</b> Written by Solflexion, Enchanter of Akalabeth, <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/" target="_top">Lost Order of Akalabeth</a><hr></font></blockquote>

&gt;   It had been a downpour throughout the

&gt; night, as they had so many times before, 
&gt; with purpose. Poor dervs.  Info:  Written by
