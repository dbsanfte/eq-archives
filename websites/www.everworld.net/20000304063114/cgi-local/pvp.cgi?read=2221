<P>I've played PvP quite a bit and generally prefer not to PK the lower level people. I think that is most peoples gripes about the PvP server. You log on and create a character. In your home town there are mobs of people slaughtering there own with no penalties.

<P>So, I have a suggestion, actually two possibilites to help keep the shouting matches to a minimum and make the most people happy. Choose one:
<P>(my choice) Have a small faction hit for attacking members of your own race. Have a large faction hit for killing members of your own race, larger if you started the fight. This faction hit should be against the vendors and guards of your home town. So, you still have the choice to kill your own race and piss people off, but you pay the price for your actions. This is justifiable based of community responses in our world. When someone kills someone in your neighborhood, especially if they are from your neighborhood, people get very upset. Guaranteed you won't be living there long even if they don't cart you off to prison.
<P>Second choice is put a restriction on PKs of your own race. Make it so you can't kill someone of your own race until they reach 4th level. The real profitable PKs are on higher level characters anyway. The second benefit is that this will stop those idiots who create characters simply to go around killing low level chars to piss them and everyone else off. Everyone else gets upset because of all the shouting and OOC that happens as a result.
<P>I definately prefer the first option because it is more realistic and less intrusive to everyone's gameplay. Fewer rules are better. Faction hits are part of the game already, so it's no real "change".
<P>The decision is up to us and what we convince Verant to do.
