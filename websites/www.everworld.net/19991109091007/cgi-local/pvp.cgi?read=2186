<P>Alright, I posted this below to some guy who made a really dumb suggestion for looting. I think this needs to be

<BR>clarified for everyone who plays on Rallos:
<P>"IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT, GET THE F^CK OUTTA THE KITCHEN"
<P>where you won't have to change the world to fit YOUR style of playing and
<BR>make EVERYONE ELSE unhappy.
<P>'How to fix the system': Well, in this case it can't really be fixed, because this is how most PKing works
<BR>(I've done hard core PK'ing in two other very popular online games - UO and Diablo - for the past 3 years or so).
<BR>You wait until someone is vulnerable, then you wax them.
<P>It just happens that spellcasters are best for this job, so they are always the ones who get jumped on for being "too powerful." Realize that it is just as easy for a Cleric to Root or Blind a caster while he is fighting a monster and then wait until the monster has the caster down to low health. Realize that ANY class except for Warriors (well Warriors CAN use Archery to chase down and kill someone low on health) can do this, by various means. Also realize that you are playing in a cutthroat society,
<BR>where you MAY get killed at any point.
<P>*** IF YOU WANT TO NOT BE ATTACKED WHILE VULNERABLE OR FIGHTING A MOB THEN *DO NOT* I REPEAT *DO NOT* PLAY ON RALLOS ZEK. IT IS THE FATE OF EVERYONE TO DIE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREER ON THIS SERVER TO THIS SORT OF THING. IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. IT HAS HAPPEND TO MY FRIENDS - IT *WILL* HAPPEN TO YOU. ***
<P>It also has happened in every single online game I've ever played - just like it happens in real life. when do thugs attack you? when you are in a dark alley, alone, and when they have superior numbers. DO you go out in the night with expensive clothing and $10,000 in your pocket into a KNOWN dangerous neighborhood or situation (dark alley)? DO YOU? are you really that stupid? well think the same while playing on Rallos Zek. don't get your ass into tight situations (fighting multiple mobs alone in a dungeon or with a weak/small group with no healer), and ALWAYS, ALWAYS be looking around you. circle the monster you are
<BR>fighting while you fight it so you can get a view all around you. THAT is how you survive on this server - by playing it smart,
<BR>*NOT* by petitioning Verant to change the entire game just so you don't have to ever die or ever feel uncomfortable.
<P>So just exactly WHO is making the petitioning, whining, and bitching? Twinkers, newbies, and morons. The three types of people that don't belong on Rallos Zek. That's all I have to say. Read the top of this post for clarification.
