<P>> 1. Will there be a PvP server in retail or is it as yet

<BR>&gt; undecided? If it is undecided, what information do they need to
<BR>&gt; make the decision in our favor?
<P>Brad has stated he wants to see 1000+ players during peak hours to maintain the PvP server. I believe we can meet this goal *if* some changes are made to the combat system and elsewhere to support PvP. There are certainly more than enough PvP gamers online that are willing to play.
<P>&gt; 2. Is there going to be a patch instituting the faction system
<BR>&gt; soon for us? If so, when?
<P>The faction system is a planned part of the Everquest game. It's a pretty important aspect at that. Verant will certainly get around to finishing it up, but probably not until they have finished stabilizing the game for Final release. Once the faction system is corrected for the game as a whole it will solve some of our PvP issues with faction hits as well.
<P>&gt; 3. Do the programmers still love us even though we are murdering
<BR>&gt; scum? If not, how come? What can we do (short of something
<BR>&gt; narly) to make them love us again?
<P>Brad wants to have a PvP server for Everquest, and has expressed his support for the PvP community on more than one occasion. I remain optimistic that Verant will give our issues greater support once the final is estabilshed in the way of online patches.
<P>&gt; 4. Does Bill and Hillary share the same bedroom? If so, does
<BR>&gt; Bill use some sort of Protection?
<P>Bill never uses protection, ala DNA evidence, pregnant hookers, and the like. Some day the truth will come out that not only do Bill and Hillary share a room, but they were secretly holding three-somes with Monica in the Oval Office.
<P>&gt; -Gray
<P>&gt; PS Is anyone else getting real bad frame rates in East Commons?
<BR>&gt; I never had this problem in P3, but in P4 I am getting prolly'
<BR>&gt; 3fps there. It's horrific.
<P>&gt; PSS Does everyone else think all CCers have a funny odor about
<BR>&gt; them?
<P>Those that I've had the opportunity to smell close up had more of an aroma of Energy Bolt about them...
<P>&gt; PSSS Ahhhh nevermind.
