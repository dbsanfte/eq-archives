<P>There was a time when a night of pleasure would have afforded the added benefit of a deep and lengthy sleep. But then again there was a time when so many things were different.

<P>Laying there, dwelling on the past, reliving the more vivid experiences in his mind, he realized that he was becoming more aware of the futility of his future. This undesirable conclusion had been gnawing at his consciousness for some time now, but he had been pushing it away in a vain attempt to avoid it. He knew in his heart though that he had changed too much to continue accepting his inability to effect change. Small victories no longer appeased him.
<P>Breaking away from these thoughts, he soaked up the sight of her laying there beside him. One thing that had never changed was his complete admiration for the female human form and his boundless pleasure in the company of a woman. Noir smiled, as he thought of the widely ranging dispositions he had encountered, never predictable but ever engaging. Despite the volatility of some he had met, he could not think of a single one that he would hesitate to be with again.
<P>It was this, and the camaraderie of his guild mates, that he had the most trouble in leaving behind. The uncertainty of his destination could mean an existence barren of such comforts. Steering clear of those fond memories of the past, he resolved to make a commitment for a new future, regardless of the consequences. His future here in Britannia had become void of any worthy purpose.
<P>His gaze fell from her face to her breast where his hand laid so casually. He marveled at how those curves always excited him. For the moment he was glad he had borrowed this little south sea cottage from Saurun, for the chill of the northern forests that he loved so well would have demanded the bear furs be over them rather than under them. The soft pastel glow of the southern dawn added colour to her otherwise pale complexion. Like him, she had spent far too much time in dungeons in the company of death, and not nearly enough time in the light of the sun and the pleasures of life. Her smooth young skin was such a stark contrast to his with it’s battlemarks and aged appearance.
<P>He looked at the scars on his hand and wondered what scars he would see if he could see through to his soul. Indeed the adventures of these years since Beta had taken their toll on all of them. He thought of those he had joined with along the way, so many that had now faded to dim shadows of a past once so clear and so bright. He thought of his brother Paul L’Estrange who had lost his way in a sea of alcohol on that other shard. How powerless he had been to overcome the forces of evil. So few he had guided away from their path of destruction.
<P>Sadness consumed him and his thoughts overwhelmed him.
<P>Much later, the melancholy was broken as she stirred. Smiling at him as she opened her eyes, and spoke with a voice so different than her usual gruff countenance; “M’Lord, what troubles thee so? Have I disappointed thee?” The creases of his frowns changed instantly into the smile that had cause so many to take a second look at this otherwise unremarkable old archer. “Nay my dear, thy are’t the savior of my despair, let not my reverie cast doubt on thine remarkable talents. Thy company, as always, lightens my burdens and livens my step.”
<P>His eyes locked on hers as he spoke, and she felt again the ease that his company alone brought to her. She was well accustomed to being in the presence of Glorious Lords, but with Noir it was his essence not merely title. With him she felt so safe and secure, not from the fear of harm or death, but from the fear of an empty, meaningless life.
<P>She stood and stretched, more for his pleasure than for the relief of any physical distress, smiling to herself she thought how differently she felt under his eyes than under those of other men she had met. While others made her feel dirty and blemished, an object to be judged by it’s faults, Noir’s gaze always made her feel warm and confident that her true significance was in her strengths, not her weaknesses. It was remarkable how adequate and valued she felt in his company. “M’Lord, ‘tis ye who brings out the best in me”, she said with a twinkle in her eye.
<P>Pleased that he could still cause that tinkle in a woman’s eye, he responded; “Lass, had ye a real father ye wouldn’t be needed the company of an old lecher as myself. Why ye grace me with yer company I cannea fathom, for surely a younger blade could cut ye more excitement than I.”
<P>Over a laugh that came straight from her heart she managed, “‘Tis not the age of the blade but the deftness with which it be wielded. There be nothin wrong with yer blade old lecher!”
<P>Getting up he turned so she wouldn’t catch the edge wearing of his smile. “Aye” he said to himself, “I shall miss this more than any could know.”
<P>Later, she opened the small package he had left for her. Accustomed as she was to the gems he loved to give, she wondered what could cause the weight she felt in this gift. She shuddered as she felt it’s significance, not in it’s weight but in it’s meaning, for in the small box she found a set of keys and three runes. Overcoming the choking in her throat and the rush of tears to her eyes she managed to whisper, “Safe journeys M’Lord. Wherever thou go, thy carry with thee the best of those of us thy hath touched and left behind.”
<P>In a clearing in the northern forests, dressed only in his black robe, Noir stepped up to the group of wisps. Summoning all his resolve, he took one last look around this world he had come to know so well and said simply “I am ready”
<P>And it was done.
<BR>_____________________
<P>Epilogue
<P>His first conscious thought was an admiration of the beauty of his surroundings. Then a sense of bewilderment as he looked about at the glade, the falls and enormous pines all about him.
<P>“Noir!! Quit this daydreaming and get back to your training!!!” The bark of the command came almost simultaneous to the cuff on the side of his head. As he grabbed his ear he marveled at how he could not recall it being so large, and so pointed at the top.
<P>Still rubbing off the sting, he grabbed the small practice bow with an unnerving confidence. Quickly notching one of the cheap flight arrows, he drew back the bow and in a blur set the missile off towards the butte. The whistle of the arrow was loud enough to draw the attention of several about. Though they looked quickly towards the sound, few looked in time to see the cheap wooden arrow slice deftly into the center of the target. But none could mistake the sound of it’s point shattering the bone shaft of the trainer’s previous shot.
<P>While all about stood speechless, the older Ranger wrinkled one heavy half-elfin brow and boomed out, “Well now, in all of Norrath I have never seen such a lucky shot!! Perhaps with luck like that we can make a real Ranger out of you yet boy.” It was enough to break the magic of the moment for all the rest, and laughter filled the air. For all the rest that is, save one young maiden. As he looked about sheepishly Noir’s eyes locked on hers and his face was instantly consumed by a smile few could master.
<P>There was something so familiar and ever so appealing in the twinkle in that young maiden’s eye.

&gt; His first conscious thought was an 
&gt; admiration of the beauty of his 
&gt; surroundings. Then a sense of bewilderment 
&gt; as he looked about at the glade, the falls 
&gt; and enormous pines all about him. 

&gt; “Noir!! Quit this daydreaming and get back 
&gt; to your training!!!” The bark of the command 
&gt; came almost simultaneous to the cuff on the 
&gt; side of his head. As he grabbed his ear he 
&gt; marveled at how he could not recall it being 
&gt; so large, and so pointed at the top. 

&gt; Still rubbing off the sting, he grabbed the

&gt; cheap flight arrows, he drew back the bow 
&gt; and in a blur set the missile off towards

&gt; enough to draw the attention of several

&gt; cheap wooden arrow slice deftly into the

&gt; While all about stood speechless, the older

&gt; and boomed out, “Well now, in all of Norrath

&gt; Perhaps with luck like that we can make a

&gt; enough to break the magic of the moment for 
&gt; all the rest, and laughter filled the air. 
&gt; For all the rest that is, save one young

&gt; There was something so familiar and ever so
