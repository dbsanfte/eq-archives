<P>The by RealmWeaver post has been given quite allot of thought and time, however, what many people fail to realize is the STEEP difference in fighting capability between varying levels. Being two levels above or two levels below can almost always decide the outcome of a duel. As a couple of others have mentioned before this difference is absolutely ridiculous and creates quite a few problems with in a free-for-all environment.

<P>While it wouldn't be hard implementing the following suggested by TheRealmWeaver the balancing of levels differences would be a "huge" undertaking to code and refine. That level system is the "meat" of the EQ game, anybody that may think otherwise is kidding themselves.
<P>Basically, I'm saying the below is a valid suggestion but acting on it's self will require allot more then simply "adding" a few new features.
<P>Below is a recap of what I'm talking about in terms of level differences.
<P>:I have test results for a L18 Paladin vs L16 Ranger. The Ranger had :equal or better ATK and DAM :numbers due to buffing, and a higher AC. :The Ranger also had dual attack and equal or better weapons :than the :Paladin. The Paladin beat the crap out of the Ranger and forced the :Ranger to zone near death :and out of mana while the Paladin was at :full mana and not significantly hurt. The Paladin did not even :use Lay Hands and the Ranger used good tactics (superior to the :Paladin). The main difference was the levels.
<P>I've had first hand experience with scenario’s such as these.
<P>In order for the GAR system to work we need more input on how to handle the level element in PvP.
<P>DarkBlight-Ex Black Merc
<P>&gt; The first step to take is to introduce at least one zone that
<BR>&gt; allows for PvP without level restrictions. This can become the
<BR>&gt; wasteland zone where large gropus of PvP players can roam at
<BR>&gt; will and vie for dominance. This would be an area where guild
<BR>&gt; rivalries could be settled, and those that controlled the region
<BR>&gt; could be considered the dominant force on the server. I would
<BR>&gt; then add to this idea by having one or more of the city arena's
<BR>&gt; also designated as level free for PvP combats. Add to that a
<BR>&gt; system of controlling who can enter the arena and when (hey it's
<BR>&gt; DSO!) and you gain a great deal of flexibility.
<P>&gt; Finally, how to solve the problem of group combat. Well to begin
<BR>&gt; with create a /gduel command that allows one group to duel
<BR>&gt; another, regardless of their levels, to support voluntary group
<BR>&gt; battles. For the spontaneous mayhem, I suggest the following:
<P>&gt; Calculating Group Attack Range (GAR):
<P>&gt; GAR is calculated by taking the highest level character in the
<BR>&gt; group and dividing his level by 10 rounded up, then adding three
<BR>&gt; to that number. This is the number +/- that the group would be
<BR>&gt; able to engage in combat. Given the GAR, a group can attack
<BR>&gt; other groups where 2/3 of the other groups members fall within
<BR>&gt; their GAR. Ex: A 40th level has a GAR of +/-7 or 33 to 47. If
<BR>&gt; the highest member were 30th, then the spread would be 24 to 36
<BR>&gt; (+/- 30 / 3 + 3).
<BR>&gt; For the group to attack, you need a 2/3 majority of the members
<BR>&gt; of the group being attacked to fall within the GAR. Further, any
<BR>&gt; characters below 1/2 the level of the highest character in the
<BR>&gt; group are not considered in the GAR calculation. Once combat
<BR>&gt; begins, neither group can add players to their group. Players in
<BR>&gt; both groups have an internal group PvP flag set. A list of all
<BR>&gt; players hostile to the group is also maintained internally. Any
<BR>&gt; players dropping from the group remain in combat mode with the
<BR>&gt; other players (flag remains set). A timeout period wherein no
<BR>&gt; combat ensues will reset a player's group PvP flag. Only when
<BR>&gt; the group PvP flag is reset can a player join a new group. There
<BR>&gt; is no restriction placed on additional groups or individuals
<BR>&gt; involving themselves in the fighting as long as they meet the
<BR>&gt; individual or group level restrictions for the player(s) they
<BR>&gt; are attacking. Note: If an individual attacks a player within a
<BR>&gt; red group, then that player has their group PvP flag set and can
<BR>&gt; then be attacked by anyone within that group.
<P>&gt; In my system group A can fight a range of 29 to 42 based on the
<BR>&gt; 35th level max char (35 +/- (35 / 10 + 3). Group B is clearly
<BR>&gt; underpowered as only one of their players is within range of
<BR>&gt; group A, so A cannot attack group B.
<P>&gt; Group B on the other hand can fight 25 to 37 levels. All players
<BR>&gt; in group A are within this range, so group B *could* attack
<BR>&gt; group A if they so desired, thus initiating the combat.
<P>&gt; Now assume a group C consists of lvl 24, 27, 28, 30, and 31.
<BR>&gt; Group C can be attacked by group A as 3/4 of group C's members
<BR>&gt; meet the GAR requirement of group A. Likewise group C has a GAR
<BR>&gt; of 25 to 37 and can initiate an attack on group A as well.
<P>&gt; Here's another example group D. D consists of lvl 1, 3, 25, 27,
<BR>&gt; 28. Group D is clearly trying to protect itself from attacks by
<BR>&gt; including a couple of gimp characters, or the high levels are
<BR>&gt; twinking for the 1 & 3 characters. (Un)fortunately the GAR
<BR>&gt; calculation excludes characters below level 11 (highest char 22
<BR>&gt; / 2) in deciding what range can attack D. Group D's GAR is 22 to
<BR>&gt; 34. Either group B or group C mentioned earlier could attack
<BR>&gt; group D, but group A could not. There is no benefit to the group
<BR>&gt; that includes very low level characters. Ideally grouping would
<BR>&gt; not be allowed unless all char's met the GAR requirement of the
<BR>&gt; highest level character.
<P>&gt; Finally here is the newbie group E, lvl 5, 6, 7, 8, and 8. Group
<BR>&gt; E has a GAR of 5 to 11. So E could attack a party of all 5's,
<BR>&gt; all 11's, or anything in between. The strongest group that could
<BR>&gt; attack them would contain a level 10, which would have a GAR of
<BR>&gt; 6 through 14. Take group F, levels 9, 9, and 10. GAR of 6 to 14.
<BR>&gt; Group F can attack E as 2/3 of group E fall within group F's
<BR>&gt; GAR.
<P>&gt; This system gives flexibility in allowing a weaker group to
<BR>&gt; attack much stronger groups, but does not allow stronger groups
<BR>&gt; to
<BR>&gt; bottom feed to far among weaker groups.
<P>&gt; Individual vs Group:
<P>&gt; If an individual attacks a group and the member he attacked is
<BR>&gt; below the lower limit of the GAR range and the attacker is also
<BR>&gt; below the GAR range and otherwise meets the level limit
<BR>&gt; requirement (+/-4), thenthe attack is an individual attack and
<BR>&gt; the player he attacked is ejected from the group. Members of his
<BR>&gt; former group can no longer cast spells on him or otherwise
<BR>&gt; interfere. If however the attacked player is within his GAR then
<BR>&gt; the attack by the individual constitutes an attack on the entire
<BR>&gt; group and as such the group can respond.
<BR>&gt; EX: Group F has lvl 5, 16, 17, and 20. The GAR is 15 to 25,
<BR>&gt; which the level 5 clearly does not meet. Anyone level 9 or below
<BR>&gt; can attack the level 5 and it is considered an individual
<BR>&gt; attack. Players level 10 through 14 who attempt to attack the
<BR>&gt; lvl 5 are unable to attack, and players 15th through 25th
<BR>&gt; attacking the lvl 5 initiate an attack on the group *AND* can
<BR>&gt; also attack the lvl 5.
<BR>&gt; Optionally anyone level 10 or above who attacks the lvl 5
<BR>&gt; initiates an attack on group F for simplicity.
<BR>&gt; This prevents high level groups from sheltering low level
<BR>&gt; players and discourages twinking.
<P>&gt; Optional Method:
<P>&gt; Players that don't meet the GAR requirements cannot join a
<BR>&gt; group. So a level 5 cannot join a group of 15 to 20s. When a new
<BR>&gt; high member attempts to join he can only do so if all players
<BR>&gt; currently grouped are valid for his GAR.
<BR>&gt; EX: Group G has 12, 14, and 15. The GAR is 11 to 19. Players
<BR>&gt; below 11 cannot join. If a 16 wished to join he could because
<BR>&gt; the 16 has a GAR of 12 to 20 which all current members of G
<BR>&gt; have. A 17 however could not join group G unless the 12 dropped.
<P>&gt; The latter method is much simpler to understand and implement,
<BR>&gt; but does restrict grouping features, abeit not unreasonably.
<P>&gt; An additional rule allowing a lower level groups or individuals
<BR>&gt; to have an unlimited upper attack range could be introduced, but
<BR>&gt; that in itself is a seperate issue for discussion and poses it's
<BR>&gt; own problems (lvl 3 player kills a L/D level 30+ and loots an
<BR>&gt; 80pp item)...
