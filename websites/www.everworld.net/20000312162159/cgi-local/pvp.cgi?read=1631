<P>When you become a official guild in EQ there will be certain fuctions that will allow this. Even on non-pvp servers. If two guilds are having disputes and want to go to war. The leader of one guild will type in what ever the said funtion is that lets them war and put the name of the other guild wich they are going to war and how long this war should last, 30 min? 2 days?. However long they want it to. The leader of the other guild must agree to this in a certian amount of time and now the two guilds are at war.

<P>This is one big reason many guilds are not coming to the pvp server. If they have a dispute with others they can either duel, in wich case you don't have to worry about some one coming and jumping you from behind while you in a fight and half dead. Or guilds can go to war and any time they see some one of the other guild while this war last they can attack and kill them. Guild wars also don't have lvl restrictions. All in guild are fair game. So if 3 or 4 lvl 20's of one guild are out hunting and they see a group 6 lvl 10 of the guild they are at war against they can kill all 6. Seems like a very good function to me. So does the dueling function. I have still not decided to come play on the pvp server or not. I started a character there in phase 4 and my first 4 fights with a wolf or bat I had some one a lvl or two above me come and attack from behind. Every time was a different person. So I read all these post how things like this don't happen and my only experience with the pvp server it happens 4 times in 5 minutes. Hmmmmm. Oh well, LOL the dumb ass's didn't get anything seeing I never got to kill anything. LOL
<P>p.s. Here is what I think of Dark Elfs
<P>&gt; But I believe you have to be an officially sanctioned guild to
<BR>&gt; use any of the EQ guild features. Your guild has to be on the
<BR>&gt; server in the Guild Database. Some looseknit guild is not going
<BR>&gt; to be able to take advantage of any of the Guild War features.
