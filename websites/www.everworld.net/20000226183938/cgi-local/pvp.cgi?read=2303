<P>Missing class in EverQuest

<P>Disenchanter
<P>A opposing faction of the Erudin ‘magical’ way of life, lead to the creation of a order that forsook Erudin teachings. Due to a complete indifference to anything classed as ‘magical’, mainly from the origins of kidnapping children, the ‘Secular Arm’ as it was known today, instilled a greater sense of ‘will’ upon its children. Through the means of a near fanatical training in swordplay and other secretive
<BR>training methods, a burning hatred of all magical walks of life a natural state of reinforced will developed within each child. This anti magic aura as it is known by wielders of magic can only be seen by those they loath the most and is oblivious to themselves. It’s many shades and vibrant colours spark terror to the wizard and necromancer alike. And as the aura’s colours shift and stir within Norrath air and a new pattern forms you can be sure a disenchanter is at work tracking what he despises the most.
<P>Note – ‘magical np’s’ apply to wielder’s of magic, pvp wielder’s of magic and targets that demand magical items to be hit. I just like to state I have not played Everquest, so many of the ideas below may not fit the game or simply be to powerful. Either way I await the coming of a Australian server and maybe the coming of a anti-magic class similar to the one I have created&#61514;
<P>Primary Attributes: WIS, STR, STA, AGI, DEX
<P>Primary Unique Ability:
<P>Nullification Sphere – magic (spell) nullification sphere surrounds the disenchanter (or party) once a day for a given amount of time. Dispels all spells effecting disenchanter and party and acts as a sure fire barrier against any incoming magical based attack, be it direct or mind based. (spellcasters within a party cannot cast spells).
<P>Restrictions:
<P>All armour up to and including Chain. No magic items. Magical items can be kept in inventory but not worn. Shopkeepers offer little when selling magical items for the very reason why a disenchanter shuns anything magical. Anti-magic aura interferes (is resistible to the disenchanter) when party members are casting buffs and healing spells. Evil to all magic casting nps’s and in Erudin, Felwithe and other areas? I am assuming that with so many spellcasting classes available, Norrath is a very magical realm.
<BR>Otherwise this class would have no niche to fill&#61516;
<P>Combat Abilities:
<P>As I am currently unaware of the importance of ac and magical items, I will assume he is as proficient in combat as a warrior, with the lack of heavier armours for he considers himself a elite warrior where speed and movement is of maximum importance. For this very reason his preference is on lighter and faster one handed weapons, for he shuns 2 handed piercing weapons as they interfere with his combat style. Personally I would increase his combat while fighting ‘magic np’s’ while his combat on other np’s is a good deal below a warriors. Unlike a warrior his combat capabilities do not cap at level 40.
<P>Hit Points:
<P>Initially his hit points are less then the warrior, but can grow to match the warrior when he is taught the body building skill. Currently I have no idea how much magical items may increase strength or even stamina to allow for wearing of chainmail? I have assumed since he has no measures of boosting his strength or for the matter any other attribute (till later in level) body building would be a means to attain the strength (plus stamina needed to help other resistances?) needed to wear such armour. To an advantage he will be able to hit harder and the added stamina gained will help endure such a life&#61514;
<P>Levelling Requirements:
<P>Similar to a ranger?
<P>Allowed Races: Barbarian, Dark-elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Human, Wood-elf.
<P>Skills:
<P>1 Mind Wall (enforce will) – Disenchanters are limited to a starting wisdom base, therefore only certain races apply to be initially trained from birth. The Secular Arm will not steal erudin and high-elf children for reasons I cannot disclose. As wisdom governs the primary attribute on how effective a disenchanter will be at resisting mind altering spells and increasing most of the disenchanters individual skills faster, mind wall adds to mind magic resistance as a added role and builds on top of this. Mainly the max level cap of mind wall will depend on your wisdom attribute. It is crucial that the disenchanter seeks out fighting magic wielding or magical targets as early as possible to raise this skill after all this is the entire point of such a class.
<P>1 Transference - project will into the weapon(s) one is currently holding to hit magical targets. Transference will subtract a set percentage of enforce will skill (subconsciously) into the held weapons(s), thus reducing the effectiveness of enforce will. Note that both enforce will and transference are starting skills that have naturally become proficient (to a certain skill point total)
<BR>from the ruthless training a disenchanter attained from birth. Of course they have level caps and must be practiced to raise them further. Transference skill level will determine witch magical targets that can be hit.
<P>1 1H Blunt
<BR>1 1H Slash
<BR>1 Piecing
<BR>1 Taunt
<BR>5 Bind Wound
<P>5 Taunt Magic – As with taunt but a sure fire way to get the magic np’s to go after you first. Enemy intelligence could allow for the spellcaster or magical creature to rush you first while other opponents would wait and watch the outcome&#61514;. Could allow for AL to act differently with a disenchanter in a party or solo. I have no idea on the in game enemy intelligence but if a magic wielder controls a group of creatures your taunts could distract it in minor ways and the way in witch its followers attack.
<P>5 Sense Magic – As with rangers tracking ability but only with the natural ability to sense ‘magic np’s’ within the air and to follow it to its source. Magic wielders claim this sixth sense as disenchanters refer to it, answer can be found in the psychoportation sciences. It is believed disenchanters have found a way to travel the astral and ethereal plains, somehow sensing the signature of magic and its wielder and innately knowing its location on the prime material plane.
<P>6 Dodge
<BR>9 Parry
<BR>11 Dual Wield
<P>12 Body Building – Temporary build up on strength and stamina to allow a disenchanter to wear heavier armour (up to chain) and hit harder.
<P>14 Double Attack
<P>14 Magic Bane – Anti-magic aura takes on a pattern to stun, similar to a momentary fright that will hold the ‘magical np’s’ for a few seconds. Target must of course be facing the opponent as it is a visual effect. Spooking effect could also slow down the opponent when fleeing.
<P>15 Apply Salt – Ability to saline weapons for a added salt damage. Increasing the skill will increase
<BR>the damage and extend the reapplying period. Normal salt can be bought or even dropped by np’s. Minor side effects of salt biting to deeply into an opponents skin could cause slight side effects in combat and spellcasting abilities. Basic components would demand salt, water, cloth and a small pouch.
<P>18 Make Salt – Now this is where it gets more interesting. Rare rock crystals or mineralised salt water
<BR>could be found in challenging places within the realm or dropped by np’s . A jeweller could be used to crush the rocks into powdered form and it would be mixed by water to form mineralised salt water. An shaman with his alchemy skill could use a Bunsen burner to burn the mineralised salt water into the very tiny crystals that make up salt in its natural form. Thickening agents could be made and then sold by shamans and mixed in with the salt crystals so that the special saline substances hold well onto the blade when applied. It would be a great way to add to the player economy. In all these cases water, special holding regents, clay bowls made from a potter, use of masons, bags, bottles, jars and even special leather cloth to apply the salts so they dig deep into specially jagged blades that a weapon smith could create.
<BR>The possibilities are endless, but in each case of ionised salt goodness the side effects of the salts bite
<BR>would produce different short time effects on the one afflicted. Of course it would be mainly geared towards disrupting ‘magical nps’ and unlike poisons would not be as fierce or long lasting as an effect.
<P>20 Dodge Magic – allows a disenchanter to sense a incoming missile based attack and effectively dodge out of the way. Never becomes overly powerful.
<P>26 Inquisitor’s Mark - A skill that should be earned through a disenchanter only quest. It is basically a new way of combat movement to increase speed and accuracy but not muscle power. Hence increasing agility and dexterity permanently.
<P>30 Dispel Ward – Remove magical traps (assuming there are magical traps within Norrath?) If the skill fails the trap will backfire onto you. Works of the tranference skill as well as you will direct your weapon to dispel the ward.
<P>31 Instil Doubt – I have little idea how this skill is used apart from having the ability to make a target run away or fight with a lesser ability? Either way in the disenchanters case it would be only directed at anything magical or wielding magic. As I have mentioned with taunt magic it could distract a magic wielder controlling a group of creatures and in this case make them even fight worse or run for their life’s.
<P>35 Disarm
<P>36 Alter Aura - Reflect back missile and mind spells back upon its wielder. Ability would need a lot of points to be effective. And would subconsciously drain the anti-magic aura around you for a certain length of time or have a reasonable duration period before it can be attempted again?
<P>40 Dispel Magic – The ability to remove the magic from items. This ability would need a lot of points to actually work at all but the disenchanted item would be slightly better then a standard item without showing any plainly obvious traits. Can backfire cause (temporary) severe damage to player hit points and attributes.
<P>Note- Most of the specific disenchanter abilities alter the anti-magic aura, be it colour or pattern. As the disenchanter levels the colours become bolder and brighter.
<P>The creation of this class has always been a personal preference of mine. While a warrior can roleplay a disenchanter to a certain extent as I have done so with few online muds and even classes that similarly fill the niche to a certain point has always satisfied me. You have probably noticed that I have taken out a few warrior skills and replaced them with others or left restrictions to the class that other players may hate and may never gain a large player base. All in all it is a anti-magic class that may or may not hold secrets to its own creation but does have enough restrictions to be original. At the very least I believe it is what’s missing from the high fantasy genera.

&gt; would demand salt, water, cloth and a small pouch. 

&gt; 18 Make Salt – Now this is where it gets more interesting. Rare 
&gt; rock crystals or mineralised salt water 
&gt; could be found in challenging places within the realm or dropped 
&gt; by np’s . A jeweller could be used to crush the rocks into 
&gt; powdered form and it would be mixed by water to form mineralised 
&gt; salt water. An shaman with his alchemy skill could use a Bunsen 
&gt; burner to burn the mineralised salt water into the very tiny 
&gt; crystals that make up salt in its natural form. Thickening 
&gt; agents could be made and then sold by shamans and mixed in with 
&gt; the salt crystals so that the special saline substances hold 
&gt; well onto the blade when applied. It would be a great way to add 
&gt; to the player economy. In all these cases water, special holding 
&gt; regents, clay bowls made from a potter, use of masons, bags, 
&gt; bottles, jars and even special leather cloth to apply the salts 
&gt; so they dig deep into specially jagged blades that a weapon 
&gt; smith could create. 
&gt; The possibilities are endless, but in each case of ionised salt 
&gt; goodness the side effects of the salts bite 
&gt; would produce different short time effects on the one afflicted. 
&gt; Of course it would be mainly geared towards disrupting ‘magical 
&gt; nps’ and unlike poisons would not be as fierce or long lasting 
&gt; as an effect. 

&gt; 20 Dodge Magic – allows a disenchanter to sense a incoming 
&gt; missile based attack and effectively dodge out of the way. Never 
&gt; becomes overly powerful. 

&gt; 26 Inquisitor’s Mark - A skill that should be earned through a 
&gt; disenchanter only quest. It is basically a new way of combat 
&gt; movement to increase speed and accuracy but not muscle power. 
&gt; Hence increasing agility and dexterity permanently. 

&gt; 30 Dispel Ward – Remove magical traps (assuming there are 
&gt; magical traps within Norrath?) If the skill fails the trap will 
&gt; backfire onto you. Works of the tranference skill as well as you 
&gt; will direct your weapon to dispel the ward. 

&gt; 31 Instil Doubt – I have little idea how this skill is used 
&gt; apart from having the ability to make a target run away or fight 
&gt; with a lesser ability? Either way in the disenchanters case it 
&gt; would be only directed at anything magical or wielding magic. As 
&gt; I have mentioned with taunt magic it could distract a magic 
&gt; wielder controlling a group of creatures and in this case make 
&gt; them even fight worse or run for their life’s. 

&gt; 35 Disarm 

&gt; 36 Alter Aura - Reflect back missile and mind spells back upon 
&gt; its wielder. Ability would need a lot of points to be effective. 
&gt; And would subconsciously drain the anti-magic aura around you 
&gt; for a certain length of time or have a reasonable duration 
&gt; period before it can be attempted again? 

&gt; 40 Dispel Magic – The ability to remove the magic from items. 
&gt; This ability would need a lot of points to actually work at all 
&gt; but the disenchanted item would be slightly better then a 
&gt; standard item without showing any plainly obvious traits. Can 
&gt; backfire cause (temporary) severe damage to player hit points 
&gt; and attributes. 

&gt; Note- Most of the specific disenchanter abilities alter the 
&gt; anti-magic aura, be it colour or pattern. As the disenchanter 
&gt; levels the colours become bolder and brighter. 

&gt; The creation of this class has always been a personal preference 
&gt; of mine. While a warrior can roleplay a disenchanter to a 
&gt; certain extent as I have done so with few online muds and even 
&gt; classes that similarly fill the niche to a certain point has 
&gt; always satisfied me. You have probably noticed that I have taken 
&gt; out a few warrior skills and replaced them with others or left 
&gt; restrictions to the class that other players may hate and may 
&gt; never gain a large player base. All in all it is a anti-magic 
&gt; class that may or may not hold secrets to its own creation but 
&gt; does have enough restrictions to be original. At the very least 
&gt; I believe it is what’s missing from the high fantasy genera.
