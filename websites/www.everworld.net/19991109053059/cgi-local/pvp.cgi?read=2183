</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> Containers - should be brouse enabled for looting 1 item

<BR>I agree... and don't let people put containers in the bank at all. EVERYONE should be forced to play with all
<BR>of their cards on the table. If you think you are going into a PvP situation, you can throw your most valuable
<BR>stuff in the bank, but not ALL of it.
<P>&gt; Nekid mages - make spells lootable (i'm a mage, wouldn't cower
<BR>&gt; around nekid though)
<BR>I agree... HOWEVER, the only real way you could do this is by putting the spellbook on the body like an item.
<BR>Whoa... that alone might solve the problem. hmm... but definitely make the spellbook like a (future) container
<BR>that can be browsed through.
<P>&gt; Everyone should lose exp for deaths PvP or not,possibly make it
<BR>&gt; minimal for Pvp
<BR>Hmm... I don't agree with this one, sorry. It's just too easy to camp spawn points and kill a person over and over.
<BR>DoT's and pets already take exp upon death and that is bad enough if your spawn point gets camped. Yeah you
<BR>can always go linkdead but you would STILL lose more than 1 death's worth of exp. would suck TREMENDOUSLY
<BR>for higher level players, no matter how small the loss, because exp gain becomes VERY slow at high levels.
<P>&gt; DAMAGE should be trimmed in PvP to %50 of normal damage or such
<BR>&gt; in order to give mele players a chance at killing mages
<BR>How about they just fix the system? As it is armor is too strong in PvP, and Agility is too important of a variable. it's veryy hard to hit a caster as is, and It's very difficult to hit and do decent damage when you hit occasionally for say 30-70 damage (it is THAT widespread) and a caster is CONSTANTLY hitting for
<BR>over 150 damage (and no wide range, either, because it is damn tough to resist PvP spells consistantly). I also
<BR>think that Spirit of the Wolf is broken in PvP, because it allows players to just "kite" another player to death
<BR>(ESPECIALLY BARDS - BARDS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY WHILE MOVING). Well... Verant clearly did not
<BR>design this game for PvP... at least they didn't think to hard about it. For example: they HAD to make Monks be powerful melee
<BR>class because they DON'T have any variables except skills and stats (yeah armor too but it doesn't really matter
<BR>that much - it's damn hard to hit a Monk with or without armor). Warriors on the other hand, if they were at their
<BR>max ability more powerful than Monks, would create an obvious imbalance. BUT, you see, this is a real jacked
<BR>up system because either way you screw the Monk or screw the Warrior. It's pretty damn tough to make adjustments, anyway.
<P>well if you want my opinion that's it... personally I think Verant did a decent job on EQ, and a good job in PvC, but a terrible
<BR>job on PvP because they did not want to take the time and do PvP right when there are so many PvC servers. They wanted
<BR>to get the game out soon, and while you can't blame them for this, it still sucks. I think they should be devoting a large portion
<BR>of resources to solving balance in PvP because WE DESERVE IT NOW. there is a growing PvP community, and it's becoming
<BR>PAINFULLY obvious that some classes are underpowered and others horrendously overpowered..
