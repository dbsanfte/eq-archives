<P>My thoughts on what needs to happen to make the PvP server work.

<P>First Bug Fixes! There are lots of little abuses out there that Im sure will be dealt
<BR>with soon but still are going to impact play. Ways to attack lower level players with pets,
<BR>invisibility glitches (still exist) and advancement exploits.
<P>A easy way to file complaint about players violating the Rules Of Conduct.
<BR>playing a Dark Elf in the beta I heard a fair bit (not nearly UO levels though) of "U
<BR>Niggaz! Come to the pass so I can slap your black bitch ass". Totally unacceptable but if
<BR>we send in a petition the guide who shows up has to hang around hoping its repeated.
<BR>Guides do not have time for that. There should be a way to file a complaint along with a
<BR>log of all the resent /tells, /shouts and /emotes I recieved. The game stores this info
<BR>anyhow so this command would be easy to code. Then in guide down time they can go
<BR>through the complaints and issues warnings and recommend bannings.
<P>A warning and banning system. Ive seen games in which when a GM warned you
<BR>about your behavior you got flagged which other players could see. With repeat warning
<BR>you got banned. Part of the reason for this Ive known, mostly younger, players who when
<BR>they first players are very immature and prone to being anti-social, but later turn into
<BR>pretty good players. Its a learning process, so one offense should not be bannable, but at
<BR>the same time the guides should not need to keep a mental list about whose been warned
<BR>and who has not. To make the server work the guides and GM's on it are going to have to
<BR>be totally fascist about bannings. People banned from the server should not be kicked out
<BR>of the game, just locked out of the PvP server unless they did something totally horrid. It
<BR>will suck for the GM's and they will get a lot of flack for it, but ultimately will save the
<BR>server, playing on the PvP server is a privilege, not a right.
<P>The damn looting bug. It makes advancement on the server very difficult for the
<BR>first 12 lvls. The only person who should be able to loot you is the one who got the kill,
<BR>that is did more than 50% damage. This also prevents the cheap bastards who hover near
<BR>difficult area's and blast you with spells as your successfully fleeing from a monster fight
<BR>gone wrong. This is maybe a realistic tactic but its is the source of a whole lot of valid
<BR>bitching on the server.
<P>Kick up the faction hit for killing your own race. What was happening in Eurdin
<BR>in B4 was just dismaying and drove a whole lot of people out of the game. Being
<BR>ambushed by four of your own race at your regen point is only so fun. I am very
<BR>dedicated to the existence of a PvP server and it made me want to quit.
<P>Plot! The existence of plot keeps people in game, giving people roles to play,
<BR>making them all chess pieces in a big game that four GM's are playing is fun for the GM's
<BR>and hugely fun for the players. As is setting up roles for players to fill. Make a human
<BR>high level player a Baron, allow him to marry a Baroness, give him the power to appoint
<BR>six knights, who then in turn appoint squires. For ten minutes of GM work, you have 16
<BR>players who are now dedicated to the game and will play in character most of the time.
<P>To be done properly this would require a little coding, but nothing hard. The
<BR>ability for a GM to add a power to a player, the /grant title to a player. A Baron has 6
<BR>charges of /grant title Knight, One of /grant title Baroness and few random ones like
<BR>/grant title Senishal.
<P>Every now and then give them a little push, appear as a vision of Marr telling the
<BR>Baron that he must retrieve the Holy Sword of Blah d'Blah which a Dark Elf mages coven
<BR>has stolen for research. Of course you also created the Dark Elf mages coven out of
<BR>players who need to find ancient writing from the Guild of Scholars in Eurdin, and as a
<BR>side not have this sword they are studying. And so on wrapping through every faction
<BR>around the world.
<P>Reward role-playing and punish Dudism. Spend a little time ghosting around as a
<BR>GM, or playing other characters. Keep a notes file of who role-plays well and who is
<BR>constantly out of character. We are in your world now, a world full of petty demigod's.
<BR>Have the gods be petty, be let it be known that its part of the encouragement of
<BR>role-playing. To the person who is constantly out of character send a zone wide emote of
<BR>"Rallos Zek frowns on <player> inability to talk like a troll, he has have been curse with
<BR>two days of incurable disease". To the Paladin who makes every effort to remain in
<BR>characters and pull others into character with him send a neat spell effect, and a zonewide
<BR>emote of "Mithrell Marr's blessing descends from the sky, rewarding <playername> for
<BR>his Fair Words and Valor. He is blessed with the might of the God's for two days".
<BR>Everyone see's this blessing or shame and know that the god's watch even if this only
<BR>happens once in a while. There should be no predictability to it, but it should happen.
