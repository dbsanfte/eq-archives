<P>Chapter XII by Spiro

<P>It had been a simple fight, the elven warriors hadn't even known what they had gotten into. The necromancer was ready to gloat about why he was called the Master, when he looked over to the horse that should have held Elenya.
<BR>“Crimson, you son of an orc, you let them escape!” the Master screamed at the top of his lungs, what ever was left of them at least.
<BR>Without another thought the Master began running down the path after Glodain and his companions.
<BR>The master called back to Crimson with out looking back, "If we don't get them back, I'll have your head on a pike, and your undead body scrubbing my floors, you imbecile," he kept running with only Elenya on his mind, and trying not to trip on rocks.
<BR>* * *
<BR>Crimson sun stood exactly were he had when the Master noticed the missing prisoners. After watching the Master run down the wrong path he bent down and picked up a rather large leather bag. After weighing it in one hand he poured out a few gold coins. A smile almost creased his face, but he managed to hold firm.
<BR>With some amusement in his mind, he spoke in a voice that would have been hard to hear even if the Master wasn't a hundred yards away, "Have fun trying to catch shadows 'Master,' I don't think I'll be joining you." He retied the bag and tossed in the air as a triumphant gesture. After hopping on his horse, he soluted and rode away.
<BR>* * *
<BR>Glodain ran almost unthinking through the woods, only turning his head slightly from side to side to make sure he had not lost his two new companions. At this speed there was no way to hide their tracks had they taken the road, so as soon as he had freed the bard he had ran into the woods. It would not be likely that any would be able to track him this far off the trail, especially not this late.
<BR>His mind kept wandering back to Taurmon and his knights. He couldn't help but wonder how the fight might be going. His thoughts shifted to Crimson sun, oh how he wished he could go back there, to finally get his revenge. He would finally be able to see his wife again, he could heal her of the insanity Taurmon spoke of. His thoughts were broken off by a yell of pain. The shock almost sent him face first into a tree, instead he managed to fall into a roll. As he got up, he saw the bard Dauthi sitting next to a tree, he looked to be in great pain, and was holding his leg.
<BR>"Oh, by Marr, what next," Glodain said, just a bit louder then he intended, "what did you do know?"
<BR>"Well obviously I hurt myself. I think I sprained my anckle." Dauthi exclaimed through somewhat clenched teeth.
<BR>"Well thats just great, we have to get away from Crimson, and the 'Master' as he called himself," cried Elenya.
<BR>"Don't worry, I think we can take some time out of our running to help the bard, it isn't likely that anyone will be following us. At least not taking the right path."
<BR>As soon as Glodain finished that statement an loud rustling noise blew threw the forest, followed by a strange scraping sound, as if something rather small was dragging something as large, or larger, then itself across the ground. What ever it was, it was coming towards them, but it was still far enough off for them to escape.
<BR>"What is that?" Elenya asked obviously not feeling very secured by Glodains words.
<BR>"It's coming from the way we just came. I thought you said they wouldn't find the path, Glodain." Dauthi accused.
<BR>"Well what ever it is, it is going to overtake us in a soon. We might have a chance to get away if you can at least walk, Dauthi."
<BR>"I can try," Dauthi said, as he tried to rise to his feet. As soon as he put weight on his anckle he jerked back in pain, falling on his butt. "Ok, I can't do it, what now?" But before an answer could be made a shout echoed through the forest.
<BR>"'ey, who's oud thar!"
<BR>"It would appear we fight." Glodain said, already in a defencive stance, keeping the enchantress behind him. The bushes shook violently as the thing approached. What ever it was, it wasn't afraid to let everyone know where it was, it was grumbling very loudly, and seemed to be making as much noise as possible.
<BR>Sweat was pouring down Glodains brow, when the ugly, bumpy, hairy face, of a dwarf popped out from behind a tree. Seeing the wood elf standing ready for a fight, he jumped out from behind the tree, raising an axe, as big or bigger then himself, in a wide circle, and bringing it down inches from Glodains forhead, faster then the elf could even flinch. Without even moving his head, or his axe, the dwarf looked around to see the bard sitting next to the tree.
<BR>"Gah, ya daft ba'd, wha in tha 'ell are ya duin 'ere?"
<BR>"Well if it isn't the dwarf. Don't worry you can put down your sword Glodain."
<BR>After a sidelong glance at Dauthi, Glodain looked back at the dwarf then stepped back while he sheathed his sword. Before he could even say a word the dwarf had thrown his axe into the tree Dauthi was sitting next to, and was bending over the injured bard.
<BR>"Wha's this? A sprain? Yer sittin 'ere, tryin ta attrak wulves, cause o' a sprain? By tha guds! Jus sit thar en Oi'll fix id up, ya wuse." With that, the ugly dwarf started to chant to a god Glodain had never heard of. In seconds the bruises around Dauthi's anckle disappeared and the look of pain on his face faded. "Thar, tha shoud du ya, now wha are ull you duin oud 'ere?"
<BR>* * *
<BR>Pigorsh shook his head and looked up, it was quite a few times his hight to the top. He heard E'gaile call from above, then he saw her small face at the mouth of the openning.
<BR>“Pigorsh! Are you alright?” she cried to him.
<BR>“Oi!” the gnome said. He shook his head and looked around. “Aye, lass, I’m ok. Go get a branch or something to fish me out of here, will ya?”
<BR>As her head disappeared from the hole, Pigorsh shuffled around to get up. As he lifted his butt in the air, he noticed the orcish artifact. It must have tumbled from his pack in the fall. As he picked it up he noticed a crack. “Hello? What have we here?” He picked at the crack untill he got a piece of the artifact away. Inside was a strange black rock, it was so black the light around him seemed to be getting sucked into it. He couldn't help but look deeper into it, as his mind losts itself in the rock, it exploded in a way he would never be able to explain. It shined so bright he had to cover his eyes with his arm, but not a glimmer of light shone from the rock. It called out to him, and he was sucked in immediatly, there were no real voices this time, no distraction, just the rock.
<BR>* * *
<BR>E'gaile searched everywhere for stick long enough to reach down to Pigorsh. She ran a few feet into the woods, when it struck her, "Why am I looking for a stick, I can just make one," she said to herself. She ran back to the hole and called out to Pigorsh, "Don't worry little guy, this won't take long." She openned her book and quickly found what she was looking for. As she started to speak the words of power she seemed to leave the world around her. All there was, was the stick and the words. She held out her hand and spoke the last word, sparkles of light apeared all around her, then suddenly, with a rush of air, a stick roughly twenty three feet long appeared in her hand. She looked up ready to save the poor little gnome when she heard clapping. A strange looking man was standing not ten feet from her.
<BR>"Hello elf, thats an interesting trick you have there. But mine is better," the man mocked her, then lifted his hands. He chanted quickly, and waved his hands around. His words took power and magic spewed from his fingure tips, then he stopped abruptly. He lowered his hands and started laughing. "Lets see how you fare against my pets little girl."
<BR>E'gaile looked at him with a confused look on her face, but that look quickly changed to one of horror, as the moaning of nearly fifteen zombies erupted around her.
<BR>"Pigorsh!" she screamed, and thrust the stick down into the hole.
<BR>As soon as it hit the ground it shattered as if made of glass, and a brilliant light shot out of the pit. The glowing form of a gnome floated out from that light. In it's hands was a rock, the rock seemed to be pulsating and growing, it also seemed to suck all the light around it far into it's black depths.
