<BR>Your thinking is short sighted. Sure it's great that you can wax the bad Paladin, but that's insignificant compared to the potential chaos that can erupt if racial boundaries and factions are not observed. Imagine if you will that all the powergaming guilds decide to ignore factions and race, and now decide to shut down the batyards in their regions. They could make the game unplayable for their own races.
<P>Even with faction hits you still have enough room to swat the occasional same-race asshole that is stealing your kills. After another 20 dead goblins that kill on the Paladin should be erased, etc. There are also other alternatives to dealing with this individual. EQ is a cooperative game. By the time he is 5+ he is going to need to think about grouping, and if no one will group with him then he is going to have a very rough time of it in EQ.
<P>It is important that there be some structure to the PvP server, and the race/factions provide us with that structure. In ones home community you can at least feel reasonably safe and focus on levelling your character without having to worry about a fellow race member stabbing you in the back every 2 minutes. Without this sense of community you will find levelling much harder and the overall game experience to be a lot more frustrating and anxiety filled.
<P>&gt; I just bought Everquest today, but i am no newbie to the game.
<BR>&gt; I was in phase 3 and 4, so I know my stuff.
<BR>&gt; Reason why I didn't buy the game yet, becuase 1) servers were
<BR>&gt; crap (though from my beta experince I knew Verant would fix the
<BR>&gt; problem)
<BR>&gt; 2) I couldn't get to the store to buy the game
<P>&gt; Anyway, I just play 1 hour and 30 minutes, made it to lvl 3 with
<BR>&gt; one bubble filled (4 to go to lvl 4:), I did say before that
<BR>&gt; their should be factions for killing your own race, and opposing
<BR>&gt; races, I kinda changed my mind. At lvl i was attack by a
<BR>&gt; paladin, who also was lvl 1, I ran to guards, I had low health.
<BR>&gt; The next time I saw the paly again i was lvl 2, the paly was
<BR>&gt; still only lvl 1. I was figthing a snake, and the paly comes up
<BR>&gt; to my kill and tries to steal. I killed the snake, and proceded
<BR>&gt; to kill the paly. i told him not to steal my kill. I saw the
<BR>&gt; paly three more times, he was always lvl 1, i was around lvl 3,
<BR>&gt; and i killed him those 3 times i saw him.
<P>&gt; Summary: Don't have factions, if people are pricks, and their
<BR>&gt; your own race, you should be able to defend yourself, without
<BR>&gt; fearing people attack of your NPC race.
<P>&gt; P.S. i became blood thirsty, after the first time i killed the
<BR>&gt; paly, i wanted to kill everyone, though i didn't. now that i
<BR>&gt; think about it, i should of.
<P>&gt; IMHO, the PVP server is the best, i was against PVP, becuase
<BR>&gt; people from UO put a bad name on it, i can see they were the
<BR>&gt; ones who lost the fights:)
