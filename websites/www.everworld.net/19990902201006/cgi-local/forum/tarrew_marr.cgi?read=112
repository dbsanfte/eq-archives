<P>The Syndicate is a more than three year old Online Gaming guild located

<BR>at http://www.erols.com/seanst/synd/iiiguild.html (click on the logo to
<BR>load the pages after the movie plays). We are more than 400 members
<BR>strong and very organized, unified and professional. Having been an
<BR>integral part in the beta testing of most of the online games currently
<BR>released or in development, we are now shifting a branch of our guild to
<BR>Everquest. With several hundred members planning on playing, we aim to
<BR>be the largest and most successful guild in EQ as we have in all other
<BR>games we have been involved in.
<P>Syndicate members have been preparing for EQ since the very beginning of
<BR>the beta. Some of our members were among the very first beta testers
<BR>into the world. Since that time we have built momentum in our
<BR>membership and are EXPLODING into the game as roleplayers and team
<BR>oriented friends.
<P>We exist, together as one team, on Tarew Marr server. We have
<BR>squads dedicated to each of the races offering opportunities for all
<BR>members. And we are currently open for recruiting of new members and
<BR>are receiving many Everquest applications a day. We respond to all
<BR>applications received within 24 hours so if you dont get a reply it
<BR>means your email address was incorrect or there was a communications
<BR>problem. We are looking for professional, mature players to join our
<BR>ranks.
<P>We are one of the largest, oldest and most successful online gaming
<BR>guilds. We pride ourselves on being mature, professional, dedicated and
<BR>motivated. Despite being a large guild we are a tight knit TEAM of
<BR>friends. We have a well organized heirarchy and every member is
<BR>important to the guild from the oldest veteran to the newest member.
<P>Our guild is run by Guildmaster Dragons who has run the guild since the
<BR>beginning. We are anti-cheat, anti-bug and what is termed "anti-pk".
<BR>In each of the major games we participate in we muster more than 100
<BR>players online at peaks times and 50+ at non-peak hours giving us a
<BR>large 24 hour online presence. Its nice to have dozens of members able
<BR>to help you out at any given time.
<P>Besides playing in online games, we also operate related sites to
<BR>support them. We have a "pagan magic" team well known in the UO world
<BR>dedicated to promoting role playing, locating and getting fixed game
<BR>bugs but most importantly to researching the secrets of the game making
<BR>it more fun for all. We also maintain a RPG gaming news site known as
<BR>The DEN (Dragon's Eye News) currently being revamped to include an
<BR>specific Everquest section. In addition our members include game
<BR>designers from many of the leading RPG companies as well as staff of
<BR>several print and online gaming magazines.
<P>The Syndicate is already a major power in the EQ world and plans only to
<BR>grow larger, stronger and more unified. We are dedicated, professional
<BR>gamers who are looking to have FUN! We have a STRONG PvP section, a
<BR>large merchant section and a fun loving monster hunting section. We
<BR>watch each others backs and hold a great many in game events, parties,
<BR>games and quests.
<P>Long Live The Syndicate!
