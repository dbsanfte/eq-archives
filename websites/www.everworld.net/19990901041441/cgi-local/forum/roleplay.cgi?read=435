<P>Cathal nods towards the few gold coins on the table in front of him saying with a slight smirk, "take em if you want, its all I have."

<P>Fen raises an eyebrow and starts to say something but Cathal holds up a hand to silence him.
<P>"I have something you might like just as much." With that Cathal slams his axe flat faced onto the table, sending the gold coins flying into the air and causing the good patrons of this fine establishment to look at the pair in suprise.
<P>Grinning Cathal said "S'yours, found it on a dead minotaur, after I removed my dagger from its back. Very good weapon really, but I'm a little clumsy with it and it draws too much attention at times. Sell it if you don't want it, worth much more than the gold I took from you anyway. Besides, I gave your gold to a widow anyways. Would you like to hear a story?"
<P>Fen, still looking at the axe and taken by the quick change in subject didn't respond.
<P>Leaning closer to Fen and lowering his voice Cathal began his story.
<P>"There was a dark elf, tier'dal as they call themselves, who proclaimed great and murderous things. He scared me. I wanted to find out who he was and how great his threat was, and further discover the extent of the threat of the dark elf nation. So, acting partly on my own and partly not, I came up with this scheme. It involved a certain high elf, Rachel."
<P>At this Fen looked up, confusion written on his features, he began to mouth a question but Cathal quickly continued.
<P>"She worked for me, in an attempt to get information from that dark elf. But I couldn't trust her and needed to get her away before she could give me away. It was I who took her from this place those months ago, last I heard she was doing fine in Felwithe. Havn't seen her since that stormy night."
<P>"You're a fool man! What a half baked crazy scheme was that? Dragging all of us in with you!...why I ought ta..."
<P>Fen stopped half way through, thinking how things had changed for him since that little adventure.
<P>"You look changed Fen. What happened to you since that little misadventure?"
