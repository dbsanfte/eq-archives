<P>First off.. Who messed up my color!!! heh.. with that out of the way, I've been giving some thought to the whole EQ PvP deal, I've decided that I will probably make a completely new site for PVP by itself with full support of PvPers. I have seen a great deal of the PvP server play and it is nothing like UO. Newbie killing is a small problem but will probably fix itself along with the help of factions to even the field out. My roomate is about as hardcore RPG as they come and he normally strays away from the PvP side of them. He told me he wouldnt' trade the PvP server for a character double his level on any other server. He insisted I quote him because he wants more people on the server so here goes: "The game is more dynamic when you have to be careful of foes that have a thinking human behind them. The wars with the Dark Elves has been a blast and played fairly well in role. I would have never seen this amount of fun on the -PvP servers, pk switch or not" and this comes from a guy who puts 12 + hours a day on the PvP server and had put nearly that amount of time on the -PvP servers.

<P>So, the new site will begin development this week and will really need a staff. So If your interested in being part of the staff that consists now only of my roomate and myself, drop me a line at
<BR>geiger@everworld.net and please include PVP STAFF in the subject. I get a ton of emails each day. This message board has been great, I hope I can bring you all a site that will do as well. feel free to send your suggestions in for features of the new site as well.
