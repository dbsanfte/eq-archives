<P>

<BR>The first step to take is to introduce at least one zone that allows for PvP without level restrictions. This can become the wasteland zone where large gropus of PvP players can roam at will and vie for dominance. This would be an area where guild rivalries could be settled, and those that controlled the region could be considered the dominant force on the server. I would then add to this idea by having one or more of the city arena's also designated as level free for PvP combats. Add to that a system of controlling who can enter the arena and when (hey it's DSO!) and you gain a great deal of flexibility.
<P>Finally, how to solve the problem of group combat. Well to begin with create a /gduel command that allows one group to duel another, regardless of their levels, to support voluntary group battles. For the spontaneous mayhem, I suggest the following:
<P>Calculating Group Attack Range (GAR):
<P>Take the highest level character in the group. Divide his level by 10 rounded up, then add three to that number. This is the number +/- that the group would be able to engage in combat. Ex: Highest group member is 40th level, so the group can engage other groups within the range of 33 to 47. If the highest member were 30th, then the spread would be 24 to 36 (+/- 30 / 3 + 3).
<P>For the group to attack, you need a 2/3 majority of the members of the group being attacked to fall within the GAR. Further, any characters below 1/2 the level of the highest character in the group are not considered in the GAR calculation. Once combat begins, neither group can add players to their group. Players in both groups have an internal group PvP flag set. A list of all players hostile to the group is also maintained internally. Any players dropping from the group remain in combat mode with the other players (flag remains set). A timeout period wherein no combat ensues will reset a player's group PvP flag. Only when the group PvP flag is reset can a player join a new group. There is no restriction placed on additional groups or individuals involving themselves in the fighting as long as they meet the individual or group level restrictions for the player(s) they are attacking. Note: If an individual attacks a player within a red group, then that player has their group PvP flag set and can then be attacked by anyone within that group.
<P>&gt; Kellindel's post lead right into my next (Sub)topic:
<P>&gt; If the scenario was: A PvP party of lvl 32, 33, 33, 34, 35,
<BR>&gt; & 35 comes upon a PvP party of lvl 23, 24, 26, 27, 27, 31.
<BR>&gt; The way it looks is the lvl 31 is screwed. What can we do here?
<P>In my system group A can fight a range of 29 to 42 based on the 35th level max char (35 +/- (35 / 10 + 3). Group B is clearly underpowered as only one of their players is within range of group A, so A cannot attack group B.
<P>Group B on the other hand can fight 25 to 37 levels. All players in group A are within this range, so group B *could* attack group A if they so desired, thus initiating the combat.
<P>Now assume a group C consists of lvl 24, 27, 28, 30, and 31. Group C can be attacked by group A as 3/4 of group C's members meet the GAR requirement of group A. Likewise group C has a GAR of 25 to 37 and can initiate an attack on group A as well.
<P>Here's another example group D. D consists of lvl 1, 3, 25, 27, 28. Group D is clearly trying to protect itself from attacks by including a couple of gimp characters, or the high levels are twinking for the 1 & 3 characters. (Un)fortunately the GAR calculation excludes characters below level 11 (highest char 22 / 2) in deciding what range can attack D. Group D's GAR is 22 to 34. Either group B or group C mentioned earlier could attack group D, but group A could not. There is no benefit to the group that includes very low level characters.
<P>Finally here is the newbie group E, lvl 5, 6, 7, 8, and 8. Group E has a GAR of 5 to 11. So E could attack a party of all 5's, all 11's, or anything in between. The strongest group that could attack them would contain a level 10, which would have a GAR of 6 through 14. Take group F, levels 9, 9, and 10. GAR of 6 to 14. Group F can attack E as 2/3 of group E fall within group F's GAR.
<P>This system gives flexibility in allowing a weaker group to attack much stronger groups, but does not allow stronger groups to bottom feed to far among weaker groups.
<P>An additional rule allowing a lower level groups or individuals to have an unlimited upper attack range could be introduced, but that in itself is a seperate issue for discussion and poses it's own problems (lvl 3 player kills a L/D level 30+ and loots an 80pp item)...
