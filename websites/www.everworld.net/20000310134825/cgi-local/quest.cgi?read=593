<P>Well, I am not a warrior. I am a shaman and I hunt with 2 great warriors every night now for a couple of months. We have experienced the steal killing by alot of the powerful spellcasters. Mainly in High Pass. We have come up with a couple of ways to deal with those kill stealers. I will share our experience with them. 1. Do not tank for them, if they attack the same creature your engaged with, back off the creature and let it go for the spell caster. Let all of the creatures buddies go with him to the spell caster. (one of three things will happen next, the caster will spend all his mana and lose a great bit of health, the caster will run to zone or the caster will die) the higher level casters will be around higher level creatures. now there are some honorable casters i have come across, although very few it seems. 2. if the caster is smart about his kill stealing. i.e. if he casts invis on his self and waits for you or your group to start attacking it and have it close to half dead before he starts pounding it with spells. Try this, have one of your party members wait for him to cast the first spell (this will cancel his invisibility and you will be able to see him) have that party member try to make a trade with the caster when he starts to cast. It doesn't matter what you trade him because you won't hit ok. you will just take that item and try to give it to him, this will interrupt his casting. Viola, your party continues pounding on the creature and you lose the effectiveness of the one party member but, you prevent the caster from stealing your kill. We only use these techniques against the KILL STEALERS. Like I said earlier there are a few honorable spell casters and not all are kill stealers and I don't mind doing a rotation with other groups. ACK! The Kill Stealers just get under my skin. I hope this helps. Happy Hunting to all you Honorable Souls.
