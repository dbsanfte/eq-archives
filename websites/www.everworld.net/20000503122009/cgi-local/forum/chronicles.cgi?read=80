<P>Drugar pushed open the castle gate with determination. He'd found the murderer.. Emperor Crush, the ruler of the Crushbone Orcs. And now, it was time to extract revenge.

<P>The gatekeeper, a Centurion, looked up and grunted in surprise. "You can't come in here!" he bellowed, stepping forward. Drugar's hammer came down on the Centurion's head with a mighty *thwack*!
<P>The noise attracted the attention of another Centurion, who drew his sword with a snarl. "Brell, smite this, my enemy, in his unholiness!" cried Drugar mightily, gesturing with his magical warhammer. A flash of red filled Drugar's vision, and the Centurion was no more.
<P>Drugar kicked the next door open, and found himself face to face with several Emissaries and Legionairres. They grinned wickedly and advanced...
<P><CENTER>* * *</CENTER>
<P>The door to the throne room heaved mightily, then collapsed inward with a crash. Emperor Crush jumped from his throne and glared at the entrance.
<P>There, stepping slowly from the doorframe, was a dwarf. Blood trickled down one temple, and his shield-arm hung limp at his side. The look in his eyes was pure vengeance - a look of burning justice, a look of the forges in which this dwarf had personally forged his own weapons. Weapons that were meant to destroy the Emperor.
<P>"Legionairres! To my side!" cried the Emperor. But his voice echoed back to him in the eerie silence.
<P>"Here's wot's left of yer Legionnaire's, yer <I>majesty</I>," Drugar said with contempt. He tossed four sets of tattered shoudlerpads at the Emperor's feet. "It's just you an' me, now.."
<P>"Who are you?" asked the Emperor, fear creeping into his eyes.
<P>"My name, is Drugar. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
<P>Drugar raised his hammer.
<P>The hammer fell.
