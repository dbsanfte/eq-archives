<P>A greeting to all the inhabitants of Norrath, my name is Aziraphale. I've been in this world but a few days and already I tire of adventuring alone. In my past I've spent time with many a group and have found that I fairly prefer the camaraderie that comes with exploring the lands with newfound friends.

<P>Myself, I'm a 4th level Ranger of Half-Elf stock. I must say the woods in this area are truly magnificent and are much welcomed in my eyes, as I prefer my time spent out of doors to that wasted cooped up in a building. And though I've been labeled a bastard by many folk, I'm as proud of both ancestries as any "true" elf or human.
<P>I'm currently residing in a region named Surefall Glade, located north of a large (and somewhat intimidating) city, Qeynos. Any courageous beings sharing the Server Universe of Erollisi Marr are welcome (nay, encouraged!) to join me in finding all that this region has to offer. Also, if there are any Guilds willing to extend an invitation to an inexperienced newcomer such as myself, it would truly be appreciated.
<P>I'm also a trifle embarrassed to say that, due to a curse put on me by a whoremonger of a wizard when I was but a babe, I live in two universes. This constant switching of body, time, and place restrict my existence in Norrath to but a few hours each day (alternate universe time). There does, fortunately, seem to be some consistency in that I can generally rely on my being in Norrath during the evening hours. A curious note: every five days there seems to be a lapse in the power of the curse whereby I can almost at will switch between the two universes - this lasts almost a full forty-eight hours! It is during this lapse when I will attempt to spend as much time as possible exploring this wondrous land.
<P>(I will not trouble you with the details of this alternate universe but to say it is a sorry place. No one adventures about and most of the populace must perform the most menial and annoying tasks to obtain currency! Give me a sharp blade and friend to watch my back and I'll happily stomach the risks taken in combat over the slow, tortuous death they make you suffer by shackling you to a table for hours on end).
<P>P.S. Is it merely my overly sensitive nose (inherited no doubt from my lovely Elven mother), or does everyone find Ogres to be truly offensive smelling? By Tunare's Spirit, even after a long day's hike I believe my boots have a rosier bouquet!
<P>(OOC) - I can usually be found online from 7pm to 10pm (EST) during the week and whenever possible on weekends. Please contact me at: eq_ranger@hotmail.com
