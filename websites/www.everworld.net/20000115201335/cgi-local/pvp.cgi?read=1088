<P>There is a game Meridian59 its blows ass now, but before it was something to see. why? because you could pk like no ones buisness. True People were dieing left and right but just as many bad people as good people, if not more good people pkers were seen in less frequency in the good days when meridian just came out. And if any of you have some actualy online experince in gaming you kow this is generally true in every game there are usually at most like 33% pkers, 33% nuetral, and 33% good, but generally there is like more than have that are not all out pkers and hunt the pkers with a passion. What I am saying is that if they make every server Pvp then the mix will be good, and for every 40th level pker there will be a 50th level do gooder to kick his ass or make his life hell, if not 2

<BR>Tis level rescrition is abslotue bullshit its so phony, and i can see people coming up with ideas to exploit this. I have been pked hundreds of times in UO, meridian, gemstone3, darkness falls, and I tell yeah its not that bad it hurts but ill live.
<BR>Whats bad is concentrating and haveing one pvp server tha is so stupid that menas you will have too much fighting what I am asking is for the game designers and everyone to realize that good and evil really do balance out and don't need super rescrition placed on by game deesigners, a 40th level pkers that kills newbies may kill a lot but soon those 50th level do goodes will be infuriated and seek him out. I kmnow this to be true because it has happened to be as a do-gooder, and a pker.
<BR>The level limit is also stupid you shoudl be able to kil some younger than you. and i have heard mention of an experince loss for pking? that is the gayest thing I have ever heard. it makes no sense you worked for the kill, and killed someone which is a sitiaution which would generally give you experince in fighting still.So logically become less skilled in fighing and spell casting all of a sunden?
<BR>No looting? if this is true i will not join everquest, as I might as well reopen my account on gemstone3 in gemstone3 there is like no penalty for death even if you get killed by a monster i hated it! i cold run anywhere i wanted die, get rezz and have everything even with no exp loss! if i get pked i expect to get looted, there reward for getting the best of me even if they are 20 levels higher, theres will come. if a monster kills me and i die, I expect there to be some thieves who will take my stuff, I would too it makes sense how could you not allow it? not allowig it would add the most amount of unrealism to the game.
<BR>realism vs fanstasy or whatever they were talking about?
<BR>Hell the only thing I see killing and hacking realism , and gameplay are these restrictions, because nohting ismore fake, and seeing some body die and no being able to take that nice shiny plate. or anything else i heard that special items shouldnt be taken bull! if they are so special you better make damn sure you are strong enough to weild it and protrect it! if not dont buy it!
<BR>People want to make all these rescritions, and stuff for playing something were you shoudl interact with people bad or good, they do these because they lack on thing.. common sense.
<BR>too many a time I have seen some newbie or weak guy walking around with liek super plate of invulnerablity, and act shock when someone high enough comes and relieves him of the item , where as if he was wearing something approaitpe to his level he proabably wouldnt be killed.
<BR>or what about traveling alone when you know there are pkers about? I mean whats going through you head? " I know there are pkers about but i will take no precautions like someone a bit sensible would do instead I will die, and waste countless hours that could have been avoided by complaining and bitching like some baby over my lost longsword, instead of preventing myself from dieng in the first place, like hunting in a group ( what a novel idea!) i havent seen too many pkers that will try to kill one guy when 5 friends are around him....
<BR>As far as levels making so much of a difference well they shouldn't! a 50th level guy should be stronger than a 1st but a 40 and 45th level guy should be quite similair. you shoudlnt gain too much per level I think of experince and growth as something more gradual and slow, beasides who becomes a swordsmaster in one motnh? its stupid gemstone has a good leveling system its gradual , but also I dont think that a 50th level guy should be invincible to a horde of level 1's hell if there is some pking 50th jerk, hunting in a newbie hunting ground, i f there are 100 level1,2 and 3 guys i would hope they could take down this one fella. if not then i think the levels are too unbalanced and need to be fixed.
<BR>I think thast all those are just my thougths as someone who has been everyhting in ways of aligemnts evil\good, for over 7 years on online rpg's
<BR>pking is needed i love it even when i am not the pker. if penalties are too high, and benefits are too low ( no loot) then yes pking will be done with but i want it because it [roiveds enjoyment its
