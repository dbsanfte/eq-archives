<P>I'm actually impressed. Not necessarily with your opinions, but with the way you stated them in this post versus you previous one.

<P>Only thing that I really want to add is that rest assured 989 will probably put up enough PVP servers to accomidate the numbers that wish to play them. Whether that be one or twenty. Maybe none if more people don't become interested in this type of gameplay. There is no sense for them to equal the amount of non-pvp (RP) type servers with strict pvp servers if there aren't the numbers to play them.
<P>Xaiv
<P>&gt; I apologize for the swearing whats bad is I wasn't aware I
<BR>&gt; sweared so much.
<P>&gt; First of all I want to defend myself in one area I am not
<BR>&gt; someone who uses cheats or whatever you said. I am not some All
<BR>&gt; out pk either. I am a pk hunter, or a pk to people that attack
<BR>&gt; my friends or me. But I enjoy when someone trys to pk me, and if
<BR>&gt; they succeed sure it's a set back but i can live on. My comments
<BR>&gt; were not too thought out
<BR>&gt; You are correct not everyone is like me so I believe out of all
<BR>&gt; the servers maybe it would be better to even out the PVP servers
<BR>&gt; with the Non-pvp servers.
<BR>&gt; About the pk switch the reason I dont like it, is that although
<BR>&gt; it does seem like it would be hard to abuse it, you know that
<BR>&gt; soe person will find a way and to me that ruins the game when
<BR>&gt; someone finds some little thing that the programmers forgot
<BR>&gt; about, and exploit it, I have every confdence in cheaters to do
<BR>&gt; this as thats what they do all the time search and find ways to
<BR>&gt; cheat... thats why i worry about the switch otherwise its a
<BR>&gt; decent idea, an idea that seems to try to comprise between
<BR>&gt; everyone's playing wishes.
<P>&gt; 20th level guy kiling a new guy? I have no problem with it I
<BR>&gt; always get killed by the super hyped up pker when I start a guy,
<BR>&gt; but there are so many sympathetic powerful good people too. They
<BR>&gt; is always someone who is willing to help, maybe I got lucky and
<BR>&gt; just was fortunate enough to have good people on my server but
<BR>&gt; it always seems like that, maybe thats why I have such a
<BR>&gt; care-free opinion on the matter. A balance is needed but I don't
<BR>&gt; agree with 1 pvp server, and 100 non pvp servers when the game
<BR>&gt; releases or some insane ratio like that it will condense the
<BR>&gt; pking extremely which for people like me who enjoy pking, but
<BR>&gt; don't want a logg on into a pk fight, or eat sleep pk fights,
<BR>&gt; its not too good. But then again maybe there people who want
<BR>&gt; that.
<BR>&gt; Thats it thanks for one reply to my last post which was actually
<BR>&gt; a little constructive and got me to think at least, unlike the
<BR>&gt; other too which were just pointless, oh yeah i am not 13 just
<BR>&gt; someone who wrote this in 2 mintues not really thinkin on the
<BR>&gt; issues. I dont believe I sweared in this one at all either..
