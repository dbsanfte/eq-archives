<P>

<BR>As I've said I'm not strongly for or against the faction system, but there are a couple of issues to consider.
<P>First off, powergamers don't care about factions. If the Covetous Crew and the League of Pirates for example want to fight one another, they will use whatever race/class characters they have available to them to do so. They wont meet up in the forest and divvy up their troops along Verant's system of good vs evil race.
<P>Second issue, certain race-class combo's may be lost to groups/guilds under a faction system. If I am a human, then I cannot operate with Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves, SKs, or Necromancers. This restricts my abilities as a PvP guild or group. The reverse is even more true for those playing the dark races, as they may have a much more difficult time forming well balanced PvP teams with only the darkies to choose from. Where will the dark races get their Druids and Monks from, for example?
<P>I haven't done an indepth analysis on these problems as I first want to see if Verant is going to even implement their faction system and make it work before I worry about how it will impact PvP. I encourage others however to further explore the ideas I've brought up here and how they feel it will impact PvP in our community. Again note that neither issue is a Role Playing issue, rather they are purely PvP (powergamer) issues.
<P>&gt; Folks suggest that a player will lose freedom by instituting a
<BR>&gt; faction hit for killing a specific race and they are right. But
<BR>&gt; SO WHAT?
<P>&gt; Jeez, if you want to kill Humans then BECOME a Dark Elf. If you
<BR>&gt; want to kill Dark Elves then become a wood elf and so on. Why
<BR>&gt; does a +pvper HAVE to be able to kill everyone?
<P>&gt; Besides, it is far more fun and organized to have group pvp.
<BR>&gt; Isn't that why they instituted LANGUAGES? The faction hits will
<BR>&gt; encourage (but not mandate) a cooperation among the races, which
<BR>&gt; will be fun for everyone and surely will attract more players to
<BR>&gt; the server.
<P>&gt; So let's look at the earlier mentioned negatives to faction
<BR>&gt; hits:
<P>&gt; 1. Foes making mules among your race for harrasment purposes.
<BR>&gt; Answer: /ignore It is a wonderous tool. Also, faction hits can
<BR>&gt; be set up so that a player that kills another player in self
<BR>&gt; defense is not raped factionally (new word) speaking. So if
<BR>&gt; player 'a' attacks player 'b' and player 'b' kills 'a' then 'b'
<BR>&gt; is uneffected because he was attacked by 'a' originally and was
<BR>&gt; defending himself. Player 'a' could also be flagged so that NO
<BR>&gt; ONE will take a faction hit for killing him for a certain period
<BR>&gt; of time.
<P>&gt; 2. It takes away the freedom of the game. Answer: No it takes
<BR>&gt; away the morons who just want to jump everyone to goof up the
<BR>&gt; game as much as they can or are just plain annoying. I fail to
<BR>&gt; see why a +pvper cannot satisfy his need for killin' by cruisin
<BR>&gt; over to halfing or human lands and wacking a few of the inferior
<BR>&gt; races *grins*.
<P>&gt; A few other concerns mentioned earlier I'd like to address (like
<BR>&gt; anyone cares LOL) regard looting. Full on looting would suck
<BR>&gt; most horribly and would effect some classes more than others
<BR>&gt; unfairly. Those who suggest that looting should be unrestricted
<BR>&gt; obviously just started the game in P4. Cause' I would prolly'
<BR>&gt; kill someone (IRL) if i lost all the stuff that took me a month
<BR>&gt; to get by a gang bang rape with a wiz or 2 Rooting me.
<P>&gt; Loosing 1 item is an acceptable and painful cost. It hurts
<BR>&gt; enough that one does not like dying at all....but will not make
<BR>&gt; me just throw up my hands and quit. I think that maybe PVE
<BR>&gt; looting kinda sucks, but I think i will accept everyone elses
<BR>&gt; opinion on that either way.
<P>&gt; Last item is newb killin. Lets stick a 1-5 level NON pvp
<BR>&gt; restriction. A player must get to 6th before he can engage in
<BR>&gt; warfare! This will solve the newb killin all togther...sheesh
<BR>&gt; what 1-5er is leaving home anyway? If they are they shouldn't
<BR>&gt; be. Stay home...kill some critters get some loot get some exp
<BR>&gt; and training as necessary and then go for for other folks.
<P>&gt; Really can't think of anything else except that I am lookin'
<BR>&gt; forward to faction hits....then maybe the humans will get
<BR>&gt; together and actually be able to take some of us Dark Brethren
<BR>&gt; on!
<P>&gt; Just my 2 cents,
<P>&gt; Gray Rage
<P>&gt; PS EQ PVP SERVER ROCKS! And this comin' from a P3 non pvp
<BR>&gt; tester.. PVP server is lots more fun ...lots more stuff to do
<BR>&gt; and lots more companionship. Lets make sure that Verrant lets us
<BR>&gt; have the server in the FInAL!
