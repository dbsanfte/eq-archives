<P>Being a dark elf wizard (one of the few that does not worship the god of hate innok) I have chosen a more outcast roll in view of the dark elf guards. Instead of my own gurads being indiffrent or amiably they are along the lines of dubious. This did not bother me too much until the faction patch came in. I soon realized that dark elf faction goes one way. DOWN. Nothing can be killed to raise dark elf faction. I find this to be rather poor planing on the part of the everquest team. I had a couple of talks with gm/guides about it but the best thing they told me to do if attacked by dark elves is turn tail and run.. The gm told me why do you have to finnish the de?? As if the guy was not bright enough to figure out what a pk is. PK's do not care about faction.. they dont care about dieing and they sure love it when they know that their opponets are not fully into fighting back for fear of become kos in there own city. With every other race this would not be a problem.. Gnomes can kill minos if there faction drops. Dwarves, wood elves and high elves just goto crush bone. Halflings kill the bandit darkelves in there zone. humans just kill some gnolls or orcs. What about a Troll you say well plunty of frogies to go around. Ogres??? lizard men make a good target. Dark elves?? well that is my question.. I talked to one guide and he said we not allowed to bring up game info like that.. he would not even tell me if it was posable to raise dark elf faction. I rather think he himself had no clue. This is something that hast to be fixed soon.
