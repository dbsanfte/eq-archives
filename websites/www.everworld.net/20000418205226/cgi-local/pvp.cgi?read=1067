<P>I like what you said stupid, but in addition..

<P>There are a few things to the faction system that were in my mind obvious, but from reading the above posts, it doesn't seem to be the case.
<P>Everyone is worried about good and evil races, yet the faction system is what 'designates' good and evil. Yes, every high elf, halfling, erudite, etc. start outs as good, and trolls, ogres and dark elves as evil.. but this is purely a starting point. Factions are very dynamic, which i dont think any of us can see the depths of how they affect things. All of our actions, be it quests, kills, who we worship and who we group with might change our faction. So to say that a high elf cleric cannot be in a guild (from an rp stand point) that is primarily dark elves, is not true. the high elf can go kill all the halflings in nektulos over and over, to the point where the darkies will tolerate him and halflings hate him. This would just be the obvious adjustments, who knows how high elves now react to him since he has been killing so-called 'good' creatures.
<P>for an example, after i had killed several qeynos guards on the bridge in s. karana, freeport citizens now viewed me as dubious, whereas before they were indifferent. guards in the high elven city viewed me the same, and orcs actually liked me (could walk around crushbone w/o an orc attacking me, except for the oracles). I am sure this is just the surface of the faction system and that there is more to it.
<P>Yes a high elf that has never done an evil deed grouping with dark elves would be a problem with a faction adjustment, but for how long? maybe grouping with opposite 'factioned' people creates enough of a hit, so that other high elves would not take a faction hit if they killed him?
<BR>to the example with a high elf healing dark elves, maybe that is enough to toggle (or should be) your factions to worse... so that anyone killing him, wouldn't be adversly affected with a faction adjustment.
<P>My point in short is that factions seem to relate across the board in a variety of ways, not just halflings hate dark elves. But more like if halfings hate me, so will humans not like me (even though i might have never done anything to humans). If i kill alot of gnomes, not only will gnomes hate me, but kobolds will love me :)
<P>Now to expand on it into a more pvp oriented world with guilds.. Guilds could have factions that adjust your personal factions.
<P>e.g. Lets say you are loved by trolls, but your guild has a notorious reputaion in the troll lands for killing huge scores of them, this could negatively affect you to the point where they are dubious about you (seemingly thinking you could be a spy, but they aren't sure :P)
<P>I think there are uncountless possibilities how factions can make PvP a whole lot more interesting.. :)
<P>thoughts and comments are appreciated.
