<P>Ok, You're 16 years old, and have one programmer, that probably won't devote all of his time to this. I hope that you have a few million dollars and enough experience. Have you ever made a game yourself before? Have you gone through the grad-school level math and physics classes to know the algorithms and physics that the game will no doubt require? Do you have about 6 years of free time? Do you have $5000 worth of reference books for the programming language(s) that you will have to use?

<BR>I have friends that have been programming since they were in 3rd grade, college level now, and combined, they would have a hell of a time cranking out a product like Doom in a couple of years.
<P>Not that I'm saying that I could do it, I'm just asking if you know what you're getting into here. Do you have a few hundered gigabytes of free space you'll need for the server? A couple T3's direct from the phone company to your house? If you do, than that's step one. Step two, get a TEAM of master programmers and conceptualists, because none of your ideas are new. No one wants to play a combination of UO and EQ, at least not enough to pay for server usage and upkeep.
<P>Rethink this. The "Me Too" market of copycat games is already full of Doom and Quake clones that nobody ever played. It doesn't need a EQ / UO clone.
<P>Maybe you should make a Text-based RPG first, with java or the like. Just know how to swim before you jump off the boat.
