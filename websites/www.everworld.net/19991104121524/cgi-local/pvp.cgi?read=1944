<P>I come on here to apologize to CC and get the same damn treatment. First let me say I am not that high. I didn't get the game untill a week and a half after it came out then I played on Fennin Ro for 2 weeks and then I moved to Veeshan to join up with guys I played with in beta. I am lvl 19. So to who ever said he has played since day 1 and is lvl 14 then well you lvl slow. I have a lvl 12 on the first server I started on. If I had started on here the first week, that would have added about 3 and a half weeks to my time and I'd be around lvl 30. But do you not think that if their are players that are over lvl 40 the GM's aren't watching em like a hawk for cheats/exploits. Damn just cause you can't do it don't mean that others can't either. Also we are not the only once on this server that high. There are many over lvl 30, I'd say 10 around 35 and some hovering around 40. They usually keep anon on. But think of this. The guys in FoH that are 40 are two rogues and a cleric. Now 1 rogue and cleric played all of beta together and where lvl 48 and 44 at the end. Now with two rogues 1 can alwasy back stab and this way they can do massive dmg in melee. But they are not the only ones. Now a 3rd lvl 38 rogue and at various times a bard/druids/warrior joins that is over lvl 30 aslo. This is possible. no one used any bug to get lots of plat as some one mentioned, nor any other exploits. When you play this long together your like a well oiled machine, and ya know what your doing. Trust me guys it is all legit. The other guild that has lvl 35+ players don't catch this shit cause they stay anon. Also our higher lvl players and their high lvl players don't get along. So their is alot of competition to keep lvling faster. now will we they be lvl 50 in a week? no, I'd say it is going to take another month. Seeing they are at the lvl now they where in beta and that now things get much harder to get good exp. But you find 3 guys that can play lots of hours and all ways at the same time. Make two of them a rogue and 1 a cleric and you alwasy fight yellows and white and you watch and see how fast you lvl.

<P>&gt; In Uo, on the Sonoma shard, FOH was well-known for being a
<BR>&gt; cheating, hacking, bug-exploiting, Blue PK'ing bunch of social
<BR>&gt; retards.
<P>&gt; It's no surprise, therefore, to see they chose not to play on
<BR>&gt; Rallos Zek. Since they can't macro skills & can't use a
<BR>&gt; third
<BR>&gt; party proggie to help them kill people, they don't want to take
<BR>&gt; a chance going up against anyone that might fight back.
<P>This has nothing to do with it Ass hole. Just cause people decide not to go pvp doesn't mean they are babies like so many of you on here seem to think. No you can't macro skills, well that means for them to get to the lvl they did they have to play and well they have played. Plenty of times have we had to talked to GM's cause players that think they know how to play but don't start /petitioning that we must be cheaters to know how to lvl so fast. Well the gm will say we are good players. Do we play lots of hours? Yes we do. what does this mean? we have lots of time on our hands. I myself am a college student and in my 5th year. I spent the first 3 and a half partying my ass off, and it has gotten a bit old. So I now prefer to stay at home, do homework wich takes maybe a hour a day, go to class, 3 hours a day and play EQ for as many damn hours I got left over that I want. If you can't do this then sorry, but don't go saying shit about people that can.
