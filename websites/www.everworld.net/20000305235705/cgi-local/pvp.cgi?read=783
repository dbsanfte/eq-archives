<P>

<BR>The five wizards fry the first warrior in record time as mentioned. The second warrior goes down in somewhat more time, with one wizard running around like a chicken without a head being pursued by the fighters. Now the mages all break for the zone (after looting), and regroup at their rendezvous point to meditaite. If the fighters get seperated looking for them, the mages may take down a third. When the wizards get their mana back, the return to look for the remaining fighters and make even shorter work of them the second time around.
<P>FYI: A 30th level Druid can heal over twice his hit points in damage and still have some mana left over for a gate spell. In addition to having 2x his normal hit points via healing he can dish out damage pretty darn well. I believe Shamans and Clerics are similar in their ability to heal massive damage. A Paladin can lay on hands and effectively double his hit points in any one combat. I don't see how a fighter has any chance against any of these other scenario's. They may (hopefully) be effective as role players in a team combat to disrupt at least one spellcaster and to soak up some damage while the rest of the party does the real damage with spell attacks.
<P>Hopefully Geiger can arrange some group combats for us so we can test out the system and see where it's truly broken and in need of repair.
<P>&gt; Actually, with the amazing hp the warriors have, they would
<BR>&gt; probably win. The wizards would, of course, dump huge amounts of
<BR>&gt; mana and wipe out the first warrior in record time. The second
<BR>&gt; one would probably die too, but, mana would start to run low
<BR>&gt; about this time or maybe even after the third warrior, but 5
<BR>&gt; wizards wielding staves and no magic will not win against even 2
<BR>&gt; warriors in combat equipment. That's the weakness to wizards,
<BR>&gt; they run out of steam, melees don't, as long as they stay alive.
<BR>&gt; And as you said, with a cleric, warriors will be as useful(more
<BR>&gt; useful?) than a wizard, as they will be able to dish out
<BR>&gt; constant damage, never stopping, and will be healed a lot so it
<BR>&gt; wouldn't be so easy to unload spells and kill him quickly. Also,
<BR>&gt; with the types of magic resistance things that are supposedly in
<BR>&gt; the game, warriors might have a better chance against
<BR>&gt; spellcasters. About rogues though, since I don't know a thing
<BR>&gt; about how backstab, and hide and sneak work with players, I
<BR>&gt; can't have a real opinion about that.
