<P>Yah I am with you my man/woman!

<P>hehe... I am just a lvl 4 Warrior, and playing PVP but I aint complaining, tho i have seen heaps complain.
<BR>If u r in a pvp server then u gotta take wots dished out... live by the sword, die by the sword. Anyways, its like this... good and bad go hand in hand as do living and dying, and wining and losing... u gotta accept one with the other and if u cant, then u shouldnt be here/there!
<P>I was attacked by a Mage.. didnt c wot lvl, but he was high enuf to translocate/dissapear... he was standing outside the safe area at Quyenos and i was sitting near a guard and this mage throws some spells on me and wastes me... i go back to get my corpse and he does it again... so the next time i go back, i attack this mage and he's like in, total panic... just as i was about to wast him he starts to dissapear and a gurad rocks up and this mage just vanishes... ok he looted my corpse and took like 3 silver pieces and he had his ZEmd pet with him... but man i almost had him, yet i didnt complain... then 4 guys apparently started on him and the mage starts complaining that it takes 4 of them to gang up on him and u all have prolly heard these idiots b4, throwing abuse at one another over their incident... but hey... if i can waste sum1 i will... and i know that if sum1 thinks the same way then they'll waste me if i'm nearby... theres lots of ppl like me... nad i hope most of them dont and wont complain... shit... i needed that $$$ that the mage took but, hey! its part of the world we play in and there's none of this crap.. "oh gimme back my Money or gimme back my staff/sword etcc" shit.
<P>If u dont like it, piss off or at least stop ya whining!!
<P>Dont try makin things bad for the rest of us just coz u cant grasp the concept of being killed and havin ya stuff taken off you for your own mistake of being where u know u shouldnt have been. Deal with it!!
<P>And yeah losing exp is a part of the whole game. So many have been copping that, that to now take that away for the whining fools would be all fucked up! Its just an obstacle placed in ya way. If you dont stuff up and get yaself killed then ya wont lose ya exp... losing exp is a way to try and teach u to not get killed. There has to be some kind of way to show u that if you r gonna get wreckless and die, then u r gonna have to suffer the consequences for your actions.

&gt; throws some spells on me and wastes me... i go back to get my

&gt; attack this mage and he's like in, total panic... just as i was 
&gt; about to wast him he starts to dissapear and a gurad rocks up 
&gt; and this mage just vanishes... ok he looted my corpse and took 
&gt; like 3 silver pieces and he had his ZEmd pet with him... but man 
&gt; i almost had him, yet i didnt complain... then 4 guys apparently 
&gt; started on him and the mage starts complaining that it takes 4 
&gt; of them to gang up on him and u all have prolly heard these 
&gt; idiots b4, throwing abuse at one another over their incident... 
&gt; but hey... if i can waste sum1 i will... and i know that if sum1 
&gt; thinks the same way then they'll waste me if i'm nearby... 
&gt; theres lots of ppl like me... nad i hope most of them dont and 
&gt; wont complain... shit... i needed that $$$ that the mage took 
&gt; but, hey! its part of the world we play in and there's none of

&gt; If u dont like it, piss off or at least stop ya whining!! 

&gt; Dont try makin things bad for the rest of us just coz u cant
