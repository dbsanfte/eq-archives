<P>My god! I love it. That is brilliant.

<BR>And you honestly, have my vote.
<BR>You lose to a PVP fight. you lose xp. sounds fair to me.
<BR>You still will not get any for pking tho. But sure, let everyone lose.
<BR>It sounds fair and reasonable to me. But you have hundreds of people that started on the PvP server somehow dilluded into thinking that all the arseholes that have plagued every other game ever made would not join this one. Then they let the PKs win all the time like morons. I think if a PK lost xp when he was killed it would actually lower the amount of senseless pks inthe game. Im sure everyone will instantly ignore me now, but I honestly hope someone with some kind of pull listens. Ellos is brilliant. If there is a senseless pk around, I know a few, well how far will he get when he is killed everytime anyone sees him for him being a pk. He will never level, instead he will plummet to the bottom of the food chain, right where his kind belong!! Please someone help me shout this abvious answer. As to those that are afraid of losing their own exp. Well it will happen. Probably to me as well being I am still low level, and have a large mouth to all of the idiots (there are a lot) in the game. But I have friends, as we all do. We can crush the senseless pkers easily enough, and thus even a wizard that is pkd will lose something, something valuable. Their xp, and eventualy their levels if they refuse to accept a loss. I play a wizard, and I do understand your complaint. If someone pks me, they should flee. As soon as I get repoped, i mem 2 spells. Root and my biggest offensive one, and charge to where they were with a vengeance knowing I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
<BR>Course, they have always fled, but I might think twice if I was just going to lose more xp. And in other's defense there is a very large downside. Camping would crush all fighter classes with this. I kill your fighter, and wait. When you come back you have nothing. Camping isnt supposed to happen, but it does. Which in itself is its own little piece of reality. When your down, expect to be kicked. Well I seem to have written a book, and I have spells to research. So I will give you all my leave. btw, I love this site. Since I found it I cant stop coming back. tell me if anyone out there likes this idea at all.
<BR>Oh, before you respond...
<BR>YES I KNOW THAT THIS WOULD HURT PEOPLE. THEY SHOULD GROW UP. THEY FIRST TIME I GOT PKD, I RETURNED WITH 6 POEPLE AT MY SIDE TO SLAUGHTER HE WHO WRONGED ME. ROLEPLAY EVEN YOUR DEATH. YOU WOULD BE SUPREMELY MAD. YOU WOULD GET EVERY FRIEND YOU EVERY HAD AND CHASED DOWN THE FOOL, THEN BATHED IN HIS BLOOD. There. thanks again, byes.
<BR>&gt; As far as the newbie thing and pking I find that to be true..
<BR>&gt; However I am far from being a newbie.. I am in the mid 20's. As
<BR>&gt; for exp loss vs being looted well that is not the reason I have
<BR>&gt; a complaint.. The fact is that certin class can hurt your
<BR>&gt; charactor.. While other classes cant.. If you get into a brawl
<BR>&gt; with a necro what does he have to lose if he dies?? He just
<BR>&gt; comes back naked and starts in on you again.. If he dies again
<BR>&gt; who cares right.. However if he kills you you lose exp, then
<BR>&gt; lets say maybe his friends know where you are boud so they keep
<BR>&gt; killing you when you spawn.. Think I making this up? It happens
<BR>&gt; and it happens quite a bit. All I am asking is to make it fair..
<BR>&gt; Either we all get exp loss when we get killed or no one gets exp
<BR>&gt; loss pvp it is that simple.
