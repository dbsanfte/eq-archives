<P>

<BR>Much better post. That's the type of feedback I was hoping for, and you brought up an issue that I've been thinking on for some time. Should NPC guards remain in outlying areas such as Commons and Oasis, or should they be removed? My initial feelings are that on a PvP server it does not make sense and certainly does not contribute to game balance for some races to have random guard posts in zones away from their homelands. Verant may have placed them there to spice things up for the evil races in their initial design, but they certainly did not consider the PvP server issues when they built these zones.
<P>I would like to hear sound arguments from the rest of you as to why these guards should or should not be removed. My personal feeling at this time is that at least some of these guards should be taken out of the PvP server. In certain regions they may be needed to protect low level players. One area that comes to mind is the Dwarven zone around Kaladim that features a number of scattered guard posts. At least some of these posts, especially those allowing access to the docks and leading to Kaladim city, need to remain to allow for traffic to flow to and from the dock areas.
<P>Please comment on specific NPC guards, the zones they are found in, and whether or not you think they should be removed.
<P>&gt; It surely was. In fact our small band was simply hunting in E
<BR>&gt; Commons (which is a 8-12 type zone) when the Humans Broadcast
<BR>&gt; our location and attacked us. We retreated to a safer spot and
<BR>&gt; called for aid. The Humans again found us, but thought better of
<BR>&gt; attacking the better organized foe (sonme died then) and
<BR>&gt; regrouped at their inn. Over the next hour the Humans gathered
<BR>&gt; an army whilst we waited...and waited....and waited. Finally
<BR>&gt; impatience got the best of us and attacked the inn (actually we
<BR>&gt; had to linger at a distance or their derned guards would have
<BR>&gt; caused some havoc). The swarmed us, but were slaughtered. Their
<BR>&gt; lack of organization and Blindness (it was nightime) caused
<BR>&gt; their death. Nothing else. It was a good fight and fun.
<P>&gt; Yes indeed. Our Charter even specifies this. Interracial PKing
<BR>&gt; is illegal unless the individual in Question is on our KOS list
<BR>&gt; which usually happens when THEY interracially kill (like some
<BR>&gt; other guilds we all know). Looters also may find themselves on
<BR>&gt; the list and when the sentence (death) is carried out, their
<BR>&gt; offense is clearly broadcast.
<P>&gt; Thank you Holly for your comments which are surely appreciated
<BR>&gt; :) You have friends up North if you are even in need :) I would
<BR>&gt; be happy to load you up as an ally if you so desire (though
<BR>&gt; Ogres are already considered allies of DB).
