<P>I like to start by suggesting the idea of PK ranking system that shows top 100 PK'ers of the server. Having such a system will bring much motivation to most PK'ers. The ranking system will be based on War Points, more war points you have the higher the rank you get (duh). The ranking system should have the following rules:

<P>1. You gain War Point for a PK frag (I hate to say frag but what the hell hehe)
<BR>2. You Lose WarPts when been PK'd (but the victor(s) would gain more Warpoints than what you lose)
<BR>3. You gain very little or zero WarPts for killing much lower levels
<BR>4. You gain little WarPts for killing someone of your own race.
<BR>5. You gain major Warpts for killing a member of your racial hatred.
<BR>6. In a group, Warpts will be divided much like how Exp is divided now.
<P>If such a system is installed in the PvP server, a terrific atmosphere will be possible. Hopefully this will turn into Good vs Evil; where Dark Elves, Trolls, and Ogres VS everyone else. At first there will be some rogue PKers that would PK others of the same race, but if they don't join the system they will be hunted down by their own. The following is my prediction on what will happen:
<P>1. The newbies will join the Good while the veterans will join the Evil. However the Good will out number Evil at a large ratio, perhaps 5:1. Also, Evil tend to be hard to play since NPCs hates them too.
<P>2. A few strong clans will be formed early for the Evils, since they are veterans they know what to do. They will start PK hunts a lot earliers than the Goods because their newbies are still trying to learn the game.
<P>3. The Top100 PK chart will be filled mostly by the Evils, this will result in few Elite Goods to form clans of their own. From here on the fun starts as both sides are organized, however the Good will never be as organized as Evils simply because its harder to organize a larger amount of people. And we all know good Organization is the key to wininng a group battle.
<P>4. Now that Good is more organized they will slowly catching up on TOP 100 chart, but Evil isn't slowing down much. There are just too many targets for the Evils and not enough targets for the Goods. The Evils will start doing hit and runs now, preying on the solo's and run as soon as a well organized Party of Good come to fight.
<P>5. At this point you might think the Good is definitely losing the war, but here is when a large amount of people will shine: City raids! As I recall I read somewhere that city raids is possible if you are in a group of high levels. Well, raiding a city is definitely will be easier for the Goods than the Evils. While this could be a lot of fine, one wrong move and the whole raiding party will be in chaos as being chased down by NPC guards while the Evils return back to their city to take advantage of easy kills. Again, organization is the key here.
<P>6. End Result: The Good will have many Elite Clans, but there will be a large amount of Rouge PKers. So most likely half of TOP Good PKer's warpt will come from killing Rogue PKs. The Evil, as organized as ever, are more likely to result in a large civil war (clan vs clan). From my personal experience, awesome PKers come with large egos, and when the egos clashes the civil war begins. There will also be some defected members from the other side. For example a human monk will probably like to associate with friends from Troll clan, however in doing so this human monk must be very well known in the Evil Side as well as being protected by his Troll friends. Otherwise you will be kill on sight by those who doesn't know you are on their side.
<P>I always believed in organized PK is more fun than random killing; its just much funner to PK someone that you know instead of a faceless stranger. And once the TOP100 ranking system is installed, you get a feeling (could be personal hatred or admiration) toward someone in the list. There is one major flaw that I'm aware of this system. Spies, with 10 character per server you can very easily create spies to infiltrate and become a member of the enemy clan, and then during crucial moments you give feedbacks to your friend of the other Side. For this reason I always believe in small clans are better than large guilds.
<P>One last note, about message boards. I also like to propose multiple in-game message boards. One board for Good only (to discuss tactics among elite clans, but vulnerable to spies), one board for Evil only, and one for everyone (to talk trash with the other side I guess hehe). And obviously the Good message boards will be located only in cities of Good, same for Evil. By having it this way, it makes a good goal for city raids. This will probably be the primary goal of a city raid because most PCs of the raided city will flee (or camp to log out) before you even enter the city. Nothing gives you more satisfaction of leaving insults in enemy message board to have them remember your presence in their very home. Once the clan houses are available to be purchased, hopefully the clan house also carries a message board. It will feel much more presonal when an enemy posted 'thank you' notes in your clan board for donating them of what was in your clan storage =).
<P>The ideas I suggested in this post shouldn't be very hard to implement but will add great atmosphere to the game. Hopefully the developers are paying attention. Btw, my suggestions here are aimed for PvP server, although normal servers can benefit from these as well. (crossing my fingers that there will be a PvP server in final release).
