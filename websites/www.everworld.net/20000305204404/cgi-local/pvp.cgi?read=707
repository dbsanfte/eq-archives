<P>> Hehe, it is possible and it has been done for few games, but

<BR>&gt; they were older games and they used DirectX 3.
<P>Exactly. These games had nowhere the amount of graphics necessary to truly tax a 3dfx card. Newer games with more textures, smoother polygons, dithering, pixel textures, etc. In other words, "GLDoomt" 3dfx is easy to emulate, "Quake2" is not.
<P>&gt; Yes I know what
<BR>&gt; 3D card does and I know why EQ needs one, its just that I know
<BR>&gt; as well that my processor could do these things as well (not
<BR>&gt; nearly as fast, but it coudl do them).
<P>You're probably right, it could do them, if it didn't have to also be running your operating system (especially if you run Windows) and the EverQuest game itself. Trust me, I have an excellent computer and any attempt to "emulate" 3dfx causes it to crawl at ~5 FPS.
<P>&gt; so I'm trying to find
<BR>&gt; smoethign that could emulate it at least until i get my 3d card.
<P>Again, you're not going to find it. 3dfx has become the standard and every new game that comes out takes advantage of the cards that are out there more and more. The old games didn't make use of all the possibilities, which is probably why people thought they could work around the need for a card.
<P>&gt; As for Voodoo Banshee, oh man no its not as good as you say,
<BR>&gt; check and compare cards and you will find that Nvidia Riva TNT
<BR>&gt; are best ones, except of course 2 monsters in SLI mode, but
<BR>&gt; other than that, if you got wicked machine (p2-300+) riva tnt
<BR>&gt; will rock (not just saying cuz i know , but i also got proof...)
<BR>&gt; banshee is only good for p200s or so where it will do as good as
<BR>&gt; riva tnt.... but on fast comps, riva tnt is the way to go
<P>If you'll read, I suggested the Banshee was the only good 2d/3d card, I never said it was better than the Riva TNT. Voodoo2 3dfx, on the other hand, gives Riva a run for it's money; neither are 2d/3d cards. The Asus might be the best 2d/3d card available, but as I said, having a 2d/3d card will never compare to having a 2dcard and a pure 3dfx card.
<P>I have a STB Velocity 128 w/ only 4MB of ram as my 2d card, and a Voodoo2 3dfx 12MB accelerator and I have yet to find a game that doesn't run at 50+ FPS on max resolution over my net connection no less. No research is necessary to tell you that 2d/3d cards do not compare to the performance of a 3dfx card, and no amount of spouting about the advertisements you have read in magazines will convince me differently.
