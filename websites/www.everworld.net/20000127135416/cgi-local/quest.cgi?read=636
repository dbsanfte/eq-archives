<P>Ok. Look for the same guy at the Inn in West Freeport. If you come from the West gate, go right as if you were going to East. The Inn has a large Brewing vat out front. Just go upstairs and hail Jyle Windshot and tell him you are after Treant Wood. He will ask for a small lantern. Give it to him and take the wood.

<BR>While you are in this zone, kill some spiderlinks in East Commons. You need their silk. While there, load up on Fire-Beetle eyes. You can sell them in Faydark to players for 2gp.
<BR>You also need Dwarven Wire. Go to Kaladim and find the Everhott guy. He wanders from the paladin guild to Everhott forge. Hail him and ask about Dwarven Wire. e will make it for 2 Tumpy Tonics. Go to Irontoe Inn in the same area and ask Trumpy Irontoe about them. He wants 2 Kiola Nuts and 2 water. The Kiola Nuts are found on the island in Ocean of Tears with the Woman on the dock. When the Boat stops, run like hell to the first building in sight. As you enter, the girl behind the door sells them for 2g6s each. Grab 4 in case you stuff it up. Run like hell back to the boat. You should make it with 15 seconds left. Give trumpy the water and a Nut and take the Tonic. Repeat this. Give Everhott the Tonics. Take the Wire.
<BR>The last thing you need is the gizmo things from the Runaway Clockworks in Steamfont. Go back to Greater Faydark and take the right turn before Felwithe. You are in Lesser Faydark. Ignore the road. Turn left and follow the wall around. You will see a road. Follow it through the zone to Steamfont. Follow the road till you see a Watchman. Take the right fork. This leads to Ak¡non. Look around the Entrance for them.
<BR>Put all your goodies in the bag and combine. When you give him the bag you get some silver, slight experience and some rations. This is probably the most useless quest i've seen yet but is fun if you like exploring. There has never been any mention of anyone getting a Trueshot Bow from it.
