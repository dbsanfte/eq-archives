<P>

<BR>I did some tests and verified that the combat system is skewed a bit too sharply IMO with just two levels of difference between combatants.
<P>Player 1: 5th Druid, ATK 99, AC 124, STR 75
<BR>Player 2: 7th Cleric, ATK 110, AC 129, STR 75
<P>First I had the Druid attacking the Cleric using a Club, non-stop for 60 seconds. The test was repeated four times. Well over half of the swings were misses, and in some cases almost 2/3. The average total damage for the club (newbie) was around 13 points over 60 seconds. The MAX damage for this weapon vs the Cleric was 8 points, determined by hitting the Cleric while she was sitting down. The max damage was never achieved with the club, with maximum done being 6 points on one hit only.
<P>Next I had the Druid attack the Cleric using a Rusy Morning Star again for 60 seconds. Test was ran three times. The average total damage over 60 seconds was 22-23 points. Again missed attacks were frequent. The MAX damage for this weapon was 12 points vs a sitting Cleric. In combat I was able to get a max damage hit of 9 once, and 8 a few times.
<P>In both cases the Cleric simply stood still and did not fight back. It was rather ludicrous. When the scenario was reversed the Cleric had no trouble hitting the Druid and scoring damage on the upper end of the spectrum. Note the similarity in AC. The Cleric used identical weapons in the test on the Druid.
<P>Spell testing was a bit more promising. Spells cast by the Druid were infrequently resisted by the Cleric, although some spells did reduced amounts of damage. Although damage for some spells was reasonable, it would not be sufficient to allow a Lvl 5 to defeat a Lvl 7 simply with magic. The 5th Druid runs out of mana before seriously harming the Cleric, who can easily heal back all the damage.
<P>I encourage others to post results of battles involving characters of differing levels. In particular I'd like to isolate problem areas with melee and spellcasting vs higher level opponents. If enough data is accumulated perhaps we can persuade Verant to modify some of the algorithms to make the +/-4 range fighting a bit more reasonable.
