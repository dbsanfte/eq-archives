<P>Folks suggest that a player will lose freedom by instituting a faction hit for killing a specific race and they are right. But SO WHAT?

<P>Jeez, if you want to kill Humans then BECOME a Dark Elf. If you want to kill Dark Elves then become a wood elf and so on. Why does a +pvper HAVE to be able to kill everyone?
<P>Besides, it is far more fun and organized to have group pvp. Isn't that why they instituted LANGUAGES? The faction hits will encourage (but not mandate) a cooperation among the races, which will be fun for everyone and surely will attract more players to the server.
<P>So let's look at the earlier mentioned negatives to faction hits:
<P>1. Foes making mules among your race for harrasment purposes. Answer: /ignore It is a wonderous tool. Also, faction hits can be set up so that a player that kills another player in self defense is not raped factionally (new word) speaking. So if player 'a' attacks player 'b' and player 'b' kills 'a' then 'b' is uneffected because he was attacked by 'a' originally and was defending himself. Player 'a' could also be flagged so that NO ONE will take a faction hit for killing him for a certain period of time.
<P>2. It takes away the freedom of the game. Answer: No it takes away the morons who just want to jump everyone to goof up the game as much as they can or are just plain annoying. I fail to see why a +pvper cannot satisfy his need for killin' by cruisin over to halfing or human lands and wacking a few of the inferior races *grins*.
<P>A few other concerns mentioned earlier I'd like to address (like anyone cares LOL) regard looting. Full on looting would suck most horribly and would effect some classes more than others unfairly. Those who suggest that looting should be unrestricted obviously just started the game in P4. Cause' I would prolly' kill someone (IRL) if i lost all the stuff that took me a month to get by a gang bang rape with a wiz or 2 Rooting me.
<P>Loosing 1 item is an acceptable and painful cost. It hurts enough that one does not like dying at all....but will not make me just throw up my hands and quit. I think that maybe PVE looting kinda sucks, but I think i will accept everyone elses opinion on that either way.
<P>Last item is newb killin. Lets stick a 1-5 level NON pvp restriction. A player must get to 6th before he can engage in warfare! This will solve the newb killin all togther...sheesh what 1-5er is leaving home anyway? If they are they shouldn't be. Stay home...kill some critters get some loot get some exp and training as necessary and then go for for other folks.
<P>Really can't think of anything else except that I am lookin' forward to faction hits....then maybe the humans will get together and actually be able to take some of us Dark Brethren on!
<P>Just my 2 cents,
<P>Gray Rage
<P>PS EQ PVP SERVER ROCKS! And this comin' from a P3 non pvp tester.. PVP server is lots more fun ...lots more stuff to do and lots more companionship. Lets make sure that Verrant lets us have the server in the FInAL!

&gt; Loosing 1 item is an acceptable and painful cost. It hurts 
&gt; enough that one does not like dying at all....but will not make 
&gt; me just throw up my hands and quit. I think that maybe PVE 
&gt; looting kinda sucks, but I think i will accept everyone elses
