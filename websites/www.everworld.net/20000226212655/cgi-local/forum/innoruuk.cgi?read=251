<P>>I agree with your claim that players who have not yet had the privelege of acquiring a great item because higher level players take those items for profit is a grave injustice. I can not count the number of times I have tried to camp an area waiting for that one special spawn, only to arrive and see multiple players who con red to me waiting in a line up as if they were buying groceries at their local supermarket.

<P>I would like however to tell you a story that happened to me and my group where true honor and the spirit of cooperative roleplaying was demostrated. My group and I were hanging out in Befallen at the third level where the SK spawns with the Bone Bladed Claymore. Two guys had been camped there waiting for the SK to spawn. My group and I had made a conscious decision not to compete for the weapon with these other two guys, even though one member of our group badly needed it. So we left them alone and killed other stuff like Ghouls and Necro's. Anyways finally the SK spawned and we heard cried for help. The two players were on the verge of death because 2 ghouls and a wisp had joined the fight with the SK. So we jumped in to help. After maybe 20 seconds the two players were dead, the SK still alive with maybe 50 HP left. We killed all of them, and my friend looted the SK and found the BBC on him (he doesnt spawn with it everytime). My group discussed what we felt was a serious moral issue. We had not defeated the SK ourselves, the other players had waited maybe 2 hours or more for him to spawn, and basically we got it by sheer luck.
<P>When the two players came back to recover their corpses, my friend who had looted the sword, in agreement with the group, gave the weapon to the warrior player who needed it. The player could not believe that we had behaved so fairly and generously.
<P>In my mind, whether the player who we gave the weapon was going to later sell it, give it to a friend, or whatever, the point is that players of different groups can use their moral sense to make decisions that seem honest and honorable. And so too in my opinion should it be with higher level players who loot items they have already or have no intention of using. Sometimes it can be so easy to just put yourself in the shoes of other people and ask yourself the one Kantian question: "Would I want people to do this to me if the roles were reversed?" If you can answer this question truthfully and honestly you will never do yourself or others an injustice.
<P>I hope to see you on the battlefield of life in Norrath. Good luck, and remember we are all brothers and sisters craving a positive and enjoyeable gaming experience.
