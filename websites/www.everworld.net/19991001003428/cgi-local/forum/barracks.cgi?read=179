<P><b>Why join the Lost Order of Akalabeth in EverQuest?</b><blockquote>We are established. Proven. Wildly successful. In Ultima Online, we grew from a guild of 5 members to a huge, organized, mature community of about 150+ members. Those members place friendship, maturity, comraderie and participation above everything, and this mixture is the key to our success and our good name/reputation.</blockquote><b>What is expected when someone applies to your Guild?</b><blockquote>After filling out our application, you will be notified by our Norrathian Councilmembers responsible for new members. If your application is accepted (may take 30 days, due to the # of applicants), you will become known to our Order as a Commoner of Akalabeth (CMNR). As a Commoner, you are considered new to our guild and will need much training, guidance and visibility. We will help you with the guidance and training, however, the visibility part is all on you.<p>Commoners will be judged and voted based upon your involvement with our guild during the 30 to 60 days of your Commoner/Initiate Phase. Involvement meaning: <i>In game participation and Conclave Forum Participation</i>. When we post news, events, stories, etc. to our forum, we hope to see you reading the posts and getting involved. When events, gatherings, quests are posted, we will certainly look for you in game to join us. If after 30 days you have not been 'visible' enough for our members to get to know you, you will most likely be dropped from the program and another candidate will take your place. If you have been visible and made a good impression, we will either promote you to the Initiate of Akalabeth rank or possibly even a Full Member. Just so you know, moving from Commoner to Full member in 30 days is not the normal practice. It takes an exceptional effort on your part to do such a thing. The normal period of this process takes 60 days, giving you two months to move from Commoner to Initiate then onto Full Member. <p>Our guild has much to offer, including a rich and mature history in Ultima Online, Tribes, Archmage and many other games. We pass this onto those who join our ranks as a full member, and we wish to preserve our holy and respected name. This is the reason for the lengthy process of our Commoner Program.<p>If you have any questions, please let us know on our public forum - the <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/conclave/" target="_top">Conclave</a>.</blockquote><b>Does the LOA provide assistance to new recruits? Training? Tutoring?</b><blockquote>The LOA plans to assign 5 guides within our guild to act as tutors/teachers for our Commoners, Initiates and our full members who are new to the lands of Norrath. Guides must either be former beta testers or have at least 3 months of experience playing EverQuest. The Guide will be responsible for monitoring the Conclave Forum, EQ LOA Chatroom (Game Client) as well as being involved in events the LOA holds in game, day to day.<p>Guides must remain patient and be good with their communication skills. As a guide, you

<BR>will be expected to monitor our Commoners and Initiates and report on their actions in our guild. Are they active? Are they participating? Do they try to roleplay at all? Do they display the ideals of the LOA in Norrath? etc. Guides report to the Norrathian Council and their information is strongly used when voting on the status of Commoners and Initiates.</blockquote><b>What is the URL for the Lost Order's web site?</b><blockquote>You can visit our 'main' entry page at: <a href="http://www.lostorder.com">www.lostorder.com</a>. Or you can skip that page and head right into our EverQuest Faction Page at: <a href="http://gamecore.net/everquest/">LOA - EverQuest Faction Page</a>.</blockquote><b>Does the LOA have a message board for members and/or guests?</b><blockquote>We sure do, it is called the <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/conclave/" target="_top">Conclave</a> and is home to many wonderful roleplayers of all alignments!<hr>Sincerely,<p>Brimstone of Akalabeth

<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=50 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt;  Why join the Lost Order of Akalabeth in 
&gt; EverQuest?  We are established. Proven. 
&gt; Wildly successful. In Ultima Online, we grew

&gt; questions, please let us know on our public 
&gt; forum - the  Conclave .  Does the LOA 
&gt; provide assistance to new recruits? 
&gt; Training? Tutoring?  The LOA plans to assign 
&gt; 5 guides within our guild to act as 
&gt; tutors/teachers for our Commoners, Initiates

&gt; www.lostorder.com . Or you can skip that 
&gt; page and head right into our EverQuest 
&gt; Faction Page at:  LOA - EverQuest Faction 
&gt; Page .  Does the LOA have a message board 
&gt; for members and/or guests?  We sure do, it 
&gt; is called the  Conclave  and is home to many 
&gt; wonderful roleplayers of all alignments!
