<P>He was running, running with no end. Not knowing where he was going. Not knowing why he was running. All he knew was he needed to run. He needed to run for more than his life, for his very soul. He looked back and saw nothing chasing, then looked ahead into the darkness in which he was running. He ran into the darkness, now with a renewed fear of what might follow. But as he looked forward he noticed he was running in a forest. It was pitch black, it must be night. The forest was no place to run at night, but he wouldn't dare stop running. He knew the evil that followed would delight on his soul that night, if he dared to stop running.

<P>The trees turned darker and darker, they were all dead from this point. He turned and ran another direction, but no matter where he ran, the trees, grass, and whole area seemed dead. What could cause this, was their any hope for him to escape this horrible nightmare. He couldn't stop running, but who knows what lies ahead. The area turned darker and more dead as he ran, he knew he couldn't keep running straight into darkness. But what follows him may be darker. He slowed, and then stopped. He looked around, everywhere, but could not see anything. Except darkness and death. He decided he would run the other way, even if this creature was evil, he would at least die with dignity. He ran back hoping for the trees to return to the way they were before. But they just became darker, and more full of death.
<P>Now he was scared beyond fright. No matter where he ran it was darkness and death. What was happening, why was it happening, he thought. But the more he thought the stronger the dark thoughts came into his mind. Should he just end his life here and now, rather than be toyed with by this evil soul. He didn't even notice he was still running, he wasn't getting tired or out of breath. Is this a horrible nightmare, he thought, but no, that would be to good to be true.
<P>He was almost insane, now, of fear and deathly fright. No matter where he went he felt the darkness beating at his very soul. Trying to break its walls, and storm it with its evil. He couldn't run, he couldn't hide. He finally stopped running and screamed his loudest scream, but no one could hear it. He knew that. His screamed turned into crying, his eyes where filled with tears. He fell to a tree. He sobbed and screamed as the darkness came. He had no defense against it, yet he couldn't let it win. He looked and saw the tree he was leaning on, it started to wilt, and crumble. Until it was no more than ashes on the ground. Could it be him who killed it by his touch, has this evil already won. Is this his destiny, his undisputable fate.
<P>He leaned on his own weight. Knowing that if he touched another tree, it would wilt and die as the other did. He couldn't handle realizing reality, he couldn't take it. He stopped crying when he couldn't force a tear out anymore. He screamed full of insanity, he held the scream as long as he could, until his voice went out. He couldn't sleep, he tried. Then he heard an echo, and evil echo. It was a laugh. It echoed in his head, loud, louder than anything he could mentally stand. But he could not do anything.
<P>Through the darkness, like a blanket over the forest, he saw someone in a robe walk forward. Alone, and seemed to be unarmed, he slowly walked to him. He wore a dark robe. Their seemed to be a circle of darkness around him, almost tangible. His steps echoed in his head, and he walked, slowly to him. He stopped, and opened the face of his robe, just enough so he could talk.
<P>"So you have finally showed up." His words echoed in his head. "I have been waiting for you. Your fate lies in my hands. I have the choice wether your destiny is fulfiled." The robed man laughs. "Alandros, you do not understand the greatness you can achieve, the evil you could strive to be. The servant of hate and darkness. Innoruk's servant you shall be."
<P>"Innoruk, the got of evil. Never, I will never serve him!" Alandros screamed.
<P>"Foolish boy, you think you have a choice over your destiny. I am Dal'shada servant of darkness, come to consume you with him, and his power. It is futile to resist, it will only make it harder for you. Soon you shall be Innoruk's servnt."
<P>Alandros screamed "Noooooo! I can't, I won't serve such evil. Leave me be."
<P>The Dal'shada removed more of the robe, and Alandros saw Dal'shada's eyes, they were totally white, with a scar in each.
<P>"Leave you be!" Dal'shada shouted,"I cannot do that, for you have an evil destiny ahead of you. You cannot even comprehend it."
<P>"What!", Alandros replied, "why me, why me!"
<P>Dal'shada pulled a dark dagger out, darker than the evil he was consumed in. "You do not understand, you will be the one. Their is no debate in that." Dal'shada stabbed the knife into Alandros' head, and chanted some words Alandros did not understand. The knife was in Alandros' head, but he felt nothing but the dark evil consume his soul. He did not understand, did not want to understand. Alandros screamed as the last of his soul left with the scream . The night grew darker, and Alandros' soul grew darker with it. He was no longer the person before, he was now as Dal'shada said. The servant of Innoruk.
