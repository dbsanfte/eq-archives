<P>Chapter VI by Spiro

<BR>“The name is Taurmon little gnome. I’m looking for my niece, have you seen her.”
<BR>“Well gee, let me think. Yah, ya friggin’ moron, we saw your niece, some red headed bastard with a bunch of orcs took her.” Pigorsh squealed to the man in white.
<BR>“Pigorsh! Glodain’s hurt, I don’t know what to do, come quick!” E’gaile blurted out between sobs.
<BR>Pigorsh jumped up from the tree and ran over to where Glodain lay. Taurmon jumped from his horse and walked over to the elf. “Here let me have a look,” he said while his men pulled the decrepit E’gaile off the man. Taurmon examined the unconscious elf for what seemed like hours, although it was only a minute.
<BR>“Get on with it damn you, what’s the friggin’ hold up.”
<P>Taurmon, without even looking, grabbed Pigorsh by the collar and pulled him to look face to face. “Listen you little pile of dung, unless you want a dead man on you hands, shut up, I am trying to help, and this is very touchy, do you understand me.” Pigorsh just stared at him; no one had ever talked to him like that.
<P>“I thought so.”
<BR>Taurmon’s men began surrounding him in a relatively perfect circle. Taurmon moved to kneel over the fallen elf’s head, he raised his hands to the air, he began chanting in a tongue faintly familiar to Pigorsh, all his men linked arms and began chanting with him. Rings of blue and yellow emanated from the choir. Glodain’s chest began to heave, it looked as if he was screaming but no sound came out.
<P>“What are they doing to him? Pigorsh, stop them! They’re killing him!” The memory of Dain’s death rushing through her head, it was so hard to trust any more. Pigorsh just sat there critiquing the whole thing, E’gaile watched in horror, why wasn’t he stopping them. She had never seen such a thing, it was atrocious; she had to do something. She jumped to her feet and ran to her magic book. Leafing through the pages she found the right spell. She focused all her will on the words in the book, until she knew it completely.
<BR>“This will stop,” she shrieked, the sound caught Pigorsh’s attention, “What’s she doing now?”
<P>She began waving her arms around and chanting as it said to do in her book, the magic took hold and threads of red and orange began trailing from her fingertips. She focused her will into the circle and directed the magic at the circle of men.
<P>Pigorsh ran at her as fast as his little legs could manage, “Don’t do it, you stupid friggin’ little girl, don’t you dear do it!” He screamed at her, but it was too late. An enormous explosion of wind shot out from the center of the circle, it knocked all the men including Taurmon to the far ends of the clearing. Glodain lay there shacking, it looked as if several large people were shacking him from his arms and legs, his face was a mask of pure pain, but still no sound came from his mouth. He slowly stopped shaking and just twitched for a second before he lay still. E’gaile ran over to his side, tears racking her face.
<BR>“What did you do, you stupid little whore, what in the friggin’ wastes of Velious did you do,” he ran up to her, and knocked her off Glodain and onto her back, rage in his eyes. His short hairs stood on end, as he began to cast a spell that would keep the idiotic girl away from his friend forever.
<BR>The magic began to take for on his fingers, when Glodain began to rustle. His eyes opened with a start, and he coughed continually. Pigorsh turned to see his friend sitting up with his mouth covered. “Glodain, your alive, that friggin’ wench didn’t kill you, thank, um, well thank Marr I guess.” He ran over to comrade almost in tears.
<BR>As E’gaile went to stand she was quickly surrounded by Taurmon’s men, swords drawn. “That was a stupid move miss, one we won’t be allowing you to do again,” they said while advancing on her.
<P>“Wait, what are you doing to her?” Glodain jumped to his feet, but quickly regretted it. He dropped to his knees in pain. “Pigorsh stop them,” but the gruff gnome just stood there, “Stop them, damn you! They’re going to kill her.”
<P>“No, I don’t think I will, your lucky your still alive after what that friggin’ wench did to you.”
<P>“What are you talking about?”
<BR>“Those men their are related to the girl that damned red-haired bastard was after, they were tryin’ to help you, when that friggin’ moron knocked them all away.”
<P>“I don’t care, she doesn’t deserve this, now you save her damn it, or to hell with you.”
<P>Pigorsh just looked at him for a second, “Fine, I save the damn girl.” He jumped up, and ran into the circle.
<P>The men went to pull him out of the way, but too slowly. Pigorsh had already managed to erect some sort of force field. As the men slashed their swords against the dome, Taurmon limped up to them.
<P>“Well it looks as if you made it.”
<P>“Who are you?”
<P>“I’m the man who saved your life.”
<P>“Then those are your men? Stop them, now.”
<P>Taurmon wasted no time; they didn’t have time for this anyway. He charged his men and knocked several to the ground. “We have more pressing business, Elenya has been here, and we have to find her.” His men quickly fell in line.
<P>“Now little man, what was it that you were telling me before.”
<P>Pigorsh told the girls uncle the full story, emphasizing E’gaile’s stupidity, and Crimson’s wickedness.
<P>“We have wasted far to much time then, that fowl man has abducted my niece, and is most likely going to hold her for ransom. We have to stop them now, before they can get away.” He and his men mounted their horses and reared them to leave.
<P>“Wait,” Glodain blurted out, “let us help, I know the man who captured your niece. I can find him, I need to find him.”
