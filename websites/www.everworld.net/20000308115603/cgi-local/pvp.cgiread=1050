</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> First off, powergamers don't care about factions. If the

<BR>&gt; Covetous Crew and the League of Pirates for example want to
<BR>&gt; fight one another, they will use whatever race/class characters
<BR>&gt; they have available to them to do so. They wont meet up in the
<BR>&gt; forest and divvy up their troops along Verant's system of good
<BR>&gt; vs evil race.
<P>We, in fact, DO like to kill CC and would find it VERY annoying if they chose to be Dark Elves (as that is what we *DB* have chosen to be). I have given this thought as CC has been our foes since UO beta and we like it that way. BUT, in recognition of the GOOD a faction system would do to the game, we would be willing to search out new foes among the Humans ect if CC and other foes of DB chose to be Dark Elves. The problem here, of course, is that CC in their desire to win will undoubtedly see our weakness and specifically create Dark Elf Clerics to HEAL their Human characters against us which will make our loyalty to Dark Elven Society shaky at best (this is an example CCer's so don't get yer' panties in a bunch *grin*). Yes indeed, I see this as a possible problem, SO I came up with a solution of sorts :) :
<P>What if the guilds were allowed to declare war on other guilds and any such fighting between them would eliminate any faction penalties? Additionally, any NON-guild member casting a beneficial spell on a guild member will temporily be flagged as allied with said guild and be subject to attack by it's foes! (Voila! Genious! *smile*)
<P>&gt; Second issue, certain race-class combo's may be lost to
<BR>&gt; groups/guilds under a faction system. If I am a human, then I
<BR>&gt; cannot operate with Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves, SKs, or
<BR>&gt; Necromancers. This restricts my abilities as a PvP guild or
<BR>&gt; group. The reverse is even more true for those playing the dark
<BR>&gt; races, as they may have a much more difficult time forming well
<BR>&gt; balanced PvP teams with only the darkies to choose from. Where
<BR>&gt; will the dark races get their Druids and Monks from, for
<BR>&gt; example?
<P>To be honest I had not given this much thought, BUT I did just now after reading your post. My response: The restriction on operating as a guild with folks having different classes ect is a minimal cost for the good a faction system will do to add playability and stability to the pvp game. Additionally, guilds can concentrate on a specific race or alignment as we have done and as I am certain the other organized groups will do too. The guild does not HAVE to be class specific, but it seems to me to be a closer guild if their primary guild related activities centered around one home city and race.
<P>As for balance, I think Verant has done a good job in this area though my data is woefully incomplete. You are correct that a we will not have Druids or Monks helping us, but I am not sure it will really matter. Don't forget the Humans will not have str of 150 or 160 either (Ogre) nor can they HIDE or, I believe, Shadow Knights.....To be honest, there is such variability that I cannot even begin to conceive the balance issues involved with race wars, but I suppose time will tell us this!
<P>&gt; I haven't done an indepth analysis on these problems as I first
<BR>&gt; want to see if Verant is going to even implement their faction
<BR>&gt; system and make it work before I worry about how it will impact
<BR>&gt; PvP. I encourage others however to further explore the ideas
<BR>&gt; I've brought up here and how they feel it will impact PvP in our
<BR>&gt; community. Again note that neither issue is a Role Playing
<BR>&gt; issue, rather they are purely PvP (powergamer) issues.
<P>As much as I respect your posts and ideas (you are very articulate), I always see you seperate Rplayers from Powergamers. I am both. I want to gain power (so I can kill better monsters and folks), but I also LOVE to roleplay. It IS fun! Would not a faction system ALLOW, if not FORCE (to a certain extent), Powergamers to ROLEPLAY at times? IE when Humans RAID Nektulos all of the Dark Elves will call for aid....would not the Powergamer stop his spawn camping for a few minutes to fight off the Humans?
