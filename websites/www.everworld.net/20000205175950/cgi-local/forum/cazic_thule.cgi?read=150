<P>Sadly, Albion now considers the Wolves of Odin enemies. We will treat the members as hostile. We will grant them no services and offer them no assistance. Our outstanding /guildwar challenge remains.

<P>Our reasons are simple. A guildmember of theirs led a train onto a party of ours causing two deaths. Instead of apologising he became abusive and tried to killsteal and deliberately dragged more trains. When I attempted to contact his guild leaders I was put in contact with the guilds' second-in-command, Vanderben.
<P>Vanderben claimed to be the guild leader and was hardly apologetic. He was abusive, arrogant and challenging. He challenged us to war verbally. We accepted but when I tried to instigate the war with the /guildwar command it turned out he was not the leader. He told us that the real leader Siegmund was with him RL but when I asked that Siegmund logged on, he refused and became increasingly insulting stating that their preferred tactic would be to 'train us' instead.
<P>So the Wolves of Odin refused to accept the official /guildwar challenge despite their earlier taunts and provocation. The leadership is clearly cowardly, honourless and incapable of acting responsibly regarding the repercussions caused by the actions of their guildmembers.
<P>We are aware that the Wolves of Odin recruitment procedure is somewhat open. They appear to invite anyone interested in joining a guild, therefore by and large many members are innocent and have no idea of the type of guild they are joining. I would take this opportunity to remind those individuals that they can leave the guild by targetting themselves and typing /guildremove.
<P>It is a shame that we must call this guild an enemy and more of a shame that they refuse to accept the /guildwar challenge.

<BR>Guildmaster of Albion
