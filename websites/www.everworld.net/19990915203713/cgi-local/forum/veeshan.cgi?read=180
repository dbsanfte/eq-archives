As the cold darkness engulfed the town, harsh winds from the North swept through the streets. Margyn pulled her robe tightly as she walked down the steps. As she expected, there stood Jinkus Felligan awaiting her. The hidden fears in his voice were evident as he greeted her.<p>"Good evening m'lady.

Years of research, teaching, and battles in the tundra had taken it's toll on the elder shaman. Her steps were noticably slower, yet she still moved with high-elven grace. Reaching in her pocket, she pulled out a smooth silver stone. As Jinkus approached, she proceeded to rub the stone which had become a spiritual charm.<p>"My friend, I know what troubles ye.

"But what if he chooses to follow the path of his ancestors?

"I believe him to be a prophet, someone who will teach us how to see through our souls."<p>"If the Tribunal were to learn of his origins, they would swiftly remove his head," whispered Jinkus.<p>"Swift and rash indeed," replied Margyn in a solemn tone. "But he has already claimed his rightful name but a few days ago. Should the Tribunal seek him out, he will lie in the shadows waiting.

Why was he not told of his family heritage? How could the Tribunal banish some of it's most devoted people? These were but a few of the endless questions prying at his soul. Forgetting all that he held precious, Xirius sought visions to answer his questions. The spiritworld soon granted his request, much to his dismay. Images of vengeance and fury clouded his mind. Witnessing the fate of Clan Trembley was more than he could bear, as he almost fell victim to his own spell. Clenching his hammer more tightly than ever before, he thrust his voice into the sky.
