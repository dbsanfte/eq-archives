<P>> PvP switch is NOT an easy way out, it is a system that has been

<BR>&gt; widely used in Text MUDs for years, and proven
<BR>&gt; effective(generally).
<P>Indeed, it is a system which has been widely used in MUDs for years. Do you know why it has been so widely used? Because the work necessary to add such features to base-code DikuMUD or MercMUD is vritually nill. MUDs are generally administrated and coded by college-age students who spend a good deal of their time in part-time jobs, studying, or drinking alcoholic beverages. In other words, the system exists because, as a general rule, MUD administrators don't have the patience, free time, or know-how to implement really effective systems to curtail abuse. In other words, it is just as much an easy way out for MUDs as it is for EQ. The difference is, we are paying to play EQ, and people are getting paid to create it. These "quick fixes" are acceptable in MUDs, but a commercial release online game should make an effort to resolve problems more practically, efficiently, and, in this case, "atmospherically."
<P>&gt; The excitement and PvP are not mutually exclusive, with 1500
<BR>&gt; players on one server there will be plenty of PKers around for
<BR>&gt; you to watch out for. Especially when mingled with RPers you
<BR>&gt; don't know who is hidden in the crowd waiting for a chance to
<BR>&gt; stab you in the back.
<P>The problem here, as I state in my editorial, is that the PKers will run rampant on other PKers because the systems I propose will not be implemented, as Verant has deemed the switch protection enough. Therefore, PvP will not be the ordered, well-meshed part of the online society that I propose. It will be the same situation as exists on UO - unrestricted chaos and pointless killings just for "fun." Sure, the people switched "off" will have fun, but what of the playerkillers who also want to roleplay? It will be very difficult to have PvP switch on and also participate actively in the roleplaying environment, because "TwinkyDoodz Bongcrashers" will be stalking you through the streets yelling obsceneties at you and your fellow adventurers.
