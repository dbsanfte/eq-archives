<P>You are trying to tell us the following is "FAR from a reality" -

<P>-
<BR>Guards attack players who have a bad reputation.
<BR>-
<P>Monsters wander the land looking for "Do-gooders". Why cant guards wander the land looking for "Do-baders"? "From what i hear monsters have great AI, so why cant guards too?"
<P>Come on, give me a break. I understand the reputation system didnt work in UO, but that isnt to say EQ will be unable to create one that does. If you break a reputation system down to its most basic points, it is really rather simple. Any player who attacks/commits crimes against others gets a bad reputation. Any player who does good deeds/kills players with bad reputations gets a good reputation.
<P>If a system such as this "and the others that RealmWeaver described" is put into effect we can limit the number of pure random killings.
<P>But dont trust me, lets test it out in Phase 4.
<P>&gt; RealmWeaver, While your heart is in the right place you are way
<BR>&gt; off on a couple points in your editorial. Before starting, let
<BR>&gt; me first state that I understand where you are coming from. I,
<BR>&gt; too, also have developed and coded countless non-graphical
<BR>&gt; MUD's, I officially work in programming as well, however the
<BR>&gt; dozen MUD's I helped write are the only game programming
<BR>&gt; experience I have.
<P>&gt; As you probably know, text-based MUD's are VERY different from
<BR>&gt; the graphic MUD's we are so fond of this day in age. Many of the
<BR>&gt; Anti-PVP limitations we used in those MUD's don't have a chance
<BR>&gt; in complex games like EverQuest.
<P>&gt; First off, 99% of the persons who took part in MUD's are not the
<BR>&gt; rapid blood-thirsty player killers that we came to know and love
<BR>&gt; in games such as Ultima Online, Meridian 59, etc. The players
<BR>&gt; you described as "bands of ranting, raving sociopathic
<BR>&gt; teenagers roaming the lands killing newness by the dozen,
<BR>&gt; cursing to high Heaven, and basically ruining everyone's
<BR>&gt; day" simply do not have the patience nor self-control to
<BR>&gt; play text-based MUD's. Even in the MUD's that placed no
<BR>&gt; restrictions what so ever on player killing, you never saw
<BR>&gt; anything near what we all witnessed in Ultima Online. The point
<BR>&gt; I am trying to make is this -- The restrictions that kept
<BR>&gt; player-killing in check on MUD's are drastically less than the
<BR>&gt; ones necessary to keep the "bands of ranting, raving
<BR>&gt; sociopathic teenagers roaming the lands killing newness by the
<BR>&gt; dozen, cursing to high Heaven, and basically ruining everyone's
<BR>&gt; day" from doing their stuff. The problem with huge
<BR>&gt; restrictions terrible enough to frighten off the
<BR>&gt; "sociopathic teenagers" also virtually eliminates the
<BR>&gt; players who wish to participate in more spirited player-killing.
<P>&gt; You seem quite fond of the idea of NPC guards to limit
<BR>&gt; player-killing. As much as this dream might appeal to anyone, it
<BR>&gt; is FAR from a reality. Current Artificial Intelligence is, well…
<BR>&gt; stupid. NPC "guards" have no ability to distinguish
<BR>&gt; between PKing and RPKing. We witnessed this in UO with guards
<BR>&gt; who laid waste to anyone and everyone. You might argue that the
<BR>&gt; UO guards just "sucked", but that is not the case. The
<BR>&gt; guards in Ultima Online nearly peaked off at current AI
<BR>&gt; intelligence. The guards can be told to simply kill anyone who
<BR>&gt; does this, and kill anyone who does that. It is impossible for
<BR>&gt; any programmer to anticipate all the actions a guard must
<BR>&gt; perform in order to wipe out PKing and encourage RPKing. Maybe
<BR>&gt; someday in the near future we will witness the birth of smart
<BR>&gt; NPC's that can differentiate between different human actions.
<BR>&gt; However, current AI limitations placed on all programmers
<BR>&gt; currently sends this dream to come to a crashing halt. (The same
<BR>&gt; goes for the roaming bounty hunter type parties you mentioned)
<P>&gt; As for "administrator assigned guilds" that would stop
<BR>&gt; abusive player-killing, I do not believe that administrative
<BR>&gt; assistance is required. That is too subject to abuse, no matter
<BR>&gt; how hand-selected the individuals are. They are and will always
<BR>&gt; be anti-PK guilds, these, however, are normally seriously
<BR>&gt; under-powered as the individuals in them are not as concerned
<BR>&gt; with PVP combat as the excessive PKers are. Most PK guilds
<BR>&gt; simply over-power/out-number them.
<P>&gt; Reputation System!? No offense, but you must be crazy. Have you
<BR>&gt; forgotten your Ultima Online nightmares so soon? Reputation is
<BR>&gt; simply too subject to abuse, without constant GM intervention we
<BR>&gt; are doomed to see reincarnations of all the "Great
<BR>&gt; Lord" PKers from UO. As with NPC AI, this is a very much
<BR>&gt; desired feature, but simply is not possible with today's
<BR>&gt; programming restrictions.
<P>&gt; Also, you mentioned in two sections about player-killing
<BR>&gt; restrictions. (I do hope that I am not breaking my NDA by
<BR>&gt; mentioning this) These are already in place in EverQuest, a
<BR>&gt; player may not attack another player either 4 levels above, or 4
<BR>&gt; levels below their current level. (I.e. a level 20 can only
<BR>&gt; attack a level 24 through level 16) I believe this is quite
<BR>&gt; sufficient, since players are still allowed to engage in duels
<BR>&gt; and this limit will be removed during guild wars.
<P>&gt; One idea that I do agree with, however, is the
<BR>&gt; "Safe-Zones". These already exist in the game in small
<BR>&gt; areas -- simply find the nearest guard post for your race/race
<BR>&gt; allies. Any 100% safe zones implemented into the game would have
<BR>&gt; to undergo extensive balancing. One issue would be that the
<BR>&gt; player killers would receive just as much protection as a
<BR>&gt; law-abiding citizen would. While I do believe that everyone
<BR>&gt; should be safe in the areas, regardless of PVP or not, it would
<BR>&gt; be subject to abuse as a safe-area out of combat to prevent
<BR>&gt; death, as well as other abuses I am sure I did not take into
<BR>&gt; consideration. I am confident that Verant Interactive can handle
<BR>&gt; these, though. As long as they do not take as long to fix
<BR>&gt; problem areas/features as the developers of UO and M59 took to
<BR>&gt; fix their bugs, I do not foresee a problem.
<P>&gt; Let me just sum up with saying that the point of this post was
<BR>&gt; not to bash down your ideas, Simply to help everyone understand
<BR>&gt; that they are not possible with today's programming environment.
<BR>&gt; There may be ways around it, UO tried to find them, but failed
<BR>&gt; miserably. These are just too many billions of possible ways to
<BR>&gt; abuse any system anyone comes up with. Without smarter computers
<BR>&gt; being able to think for themselves, the prospect of a game
<BR>&gt; handling the player-killing just will not happen. Verant would
<BR>&gt; have to hire hundreds of individuals to devote their entire day
<BR>&gt; just to stopping excessive and abusive player killing. They
<BR>&gt; choose the simplest and most feasible route available to them at
<BR>&gt; this time. I commend them for it, as it seems to be working
<BR>&gt; almost perfectly.
