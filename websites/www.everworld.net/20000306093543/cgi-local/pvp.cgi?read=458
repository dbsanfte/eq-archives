</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>First off i resent the comment about socio-pathic teenager Pkers. I love RPGs and am considered by most of my friends to be a "die-hard" rpg gamer. I admit I couldn't grow a mustache and can't spell, but I have played more text and Graphical MUDs than I can name. Sometimes playing the do-gooder, some times the pyscho pker. I admit I have partaked in many childish pranks (most recently deleting my schools laughable protection program "Fortres" and installing Quake 2 on all the library computers and starting a huge deathmatch during lunch) but, I have used my slight amount of patience to participate in real ROLE-PLAY. My point??? I have none, but instead would rather ramble on in a childish manner.

<P>You see the great thing about Online Games is that you can log on and enjoy a good romp in the woods with people 3x your age or 3x less and still be able to have fun. You are however, right about one thing--reputation does matter a lot. I do play to impress my friends (or perhaps to slaughter them : ) but i also play to have fun and I do role-play. Perhaps one of the most memerable moments was when I was on a fairly recent MPOG RPG - Lineage (It's made by a korean company NC Soft). After a viscous battle against several pyscho korean PKs i doscovered to my surprise that both of them were over 20 (one was 35) and one was even a --gasp-- computer teacher!!!!
<P>While I am talking about Lineage I would like to point out that its rather simply reputation system is by far one of the most effective implementions of PK/Non PK systems I have ever seen (this could however be due to the fact there are fewer than a 1,000 players). In the game when the cursor passes over a player there name is shown in shades of red, blue, or white. People who have battled and killed hundreds of NPCs have vibrant blue names, Newbies have plain white names, and people who have killed even several players have bright red names. Also anyone over level ten has a title of their chose. If you PK a "good" character near a guard, the guard(s) chase you untill you die. In this way it was easy to steer clear of mass-murderers and play (ROLE-PLAY) with other characters like you.
<P>Why was this so effective??? I believe it worked well for two reasons: 1. If a newbie is chased by a PKer then he can easily (or sometimes not so easily) escape by running to a guard. 2. In the game it was extremely easy for a high-level PKer to die by angering even a low-level character with a lot of friends. I am not saying that EQ should use this reputation system I am merely pointing out it can be made to work, and would like to add--can be used to enhance game-play. Another thing; will the NPC guards did CASUALLY assist protecting overkilling, in my opion the best way to stop casual pkers is player bounty hunting. I don't want this to be confused with NPC guards roaming the lands searching for PKers. No, I think a system of bounty hunter guilds should be implemented. Places were Players can invest money into have a bounty posted. Sure a low-level player probably couldn't be able to post enough money to interest a hard-core hunter--however several could. I would DEFINITlY like to see a bounty hunting system implemented.
<P>On last thing--> despite all the criticsm it has recieved, the current system IS perhaps one of the best out there. It will always be impossible for perfection but still, I can not believe something can not be implemented that will help all the real role-players out there. And one other thing to keep in mind--while most of you dislike socio-pathic teenagers they do exist and in great numbers. I would even be willing to bet within the first month EverQuest comes out at least half of the players will be under 18.
