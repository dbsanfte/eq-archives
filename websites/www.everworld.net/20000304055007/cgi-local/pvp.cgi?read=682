</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> I have never heard of a 3dfx emulator, the reason the ones you

<BR>&gt; have are a joke is probably because ALL of them are a joke. The
<BR>&gt; function of a 3dfx card is to take the load off of your central
<BR>&gt; processor for rendering 3d graphics because a regular video card
<BR>&gt; and processor cannot deal with the advanced graphics in 3dfx (
<BR>&gt; trilinear mipmapping, dual-texture pixels, pixel dithering,
<BR>&gt; etc.) So the whole idea of an emulator is defunct, it just isn't
<BR>&gt; possible and I wouldn't count on it.
<P>Hehe, it is possible and it has been done for few games, but they were older games and they used DirectX 3. Yes I know what 3D card does and I know why EQ needs one, its just that I know as well that my processor could do these things as well (not nearly as fast, but it coudl do them), so I'm trying to find smoethign that could emulate it at least until i get my 3d card.
<P>&gt; Because Everquest REQUIRES a 3dfx card - most games just
<BR>&gt; recommend them.
<P>&gt; No. And on a side note, why did you purchase a 2d/3d card if you
<BR>&gt; need 3dfx and already have a 2d card? The only 2d/3d card on the
<BR>&gt; market that comes close to the performance of pure 3dfx cards is
<BR>&gt; the Voodoo Banshee, but why go with it if you already have the
<BR>&gt; Matrox?! My advice to you: during beta test, send out for a
<BR>&gt; Voodoo1 or Voodoo2 or Riva TNT card and return your 2d/3d card
<BR>&gt; when it arrives.
<P>Ok man you are completely wrong and nor you do understand situation, but no offense there...
<P>As for Voodoo Banshee, oh man no its not as good as you say, check and compare cards and you will find that Nvidia Riva TNT are best ones, except of course 2 monsters in SLI mode, but other than that, if you got wicked machine (p2-300+) riva tnt will rock (not just saying cuz i know , but i also got proof...)
<BR>banshee is only good for p200s or so where it will do as good as riva tnt.... but on fast comps, riva tnt is the way to go
<P>as for it, I'm getting special card Asus 3400TNT/TV, which is best there is currently, and its significantly better than Viper550...which is again better than Monster Fusion (could debate this one..so lets say equivalent).. Asus3400TNT/TV is wicked...so anyway wont say why i need new card i'll just say it has somethig to do with my computer and stuff...networks etc
<P>as for emulator, it would work fine and I dont need blazing 60frames per second or something that i'd get normally with average 3d accellerator card... I' just need ~15+frames per second I just wanna see the game and get some things established until I get my 3d card, heh ah well.. thanks for trying to tell me what to get tho I already devoted a lot of time studying current 3d cards.
<BR>Thanks anyway.
