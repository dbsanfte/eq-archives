<P>I know not all of you are going to agree with me but this is the way I feel. I really do not think this is a case of the grass is always greener.. The first topic I want to discuss is exp loss.

<P>This is a very old problem that nobody has fixed, oh I know they said they fixed it but that was nothing but a lie. There are two main ways to get exp loss in pvp battle. One is death by DoT and the other is by Pet. This is very unacceptable, the programers had far too much time already to fix this problem. They need to one of two things.. fix it so no exp loss OR make it so every one has exp loss when they die..
<P>DoT spells I feel are way to powerful.. I feel that DoT spell should be just as unrealable as DD spells.. why? because there are far to many druids kiting red monsters around, this goes with necros and shamons to a point.. I mean why group when you can kill that red monster yourself? I know sow makes all the diffrence but the true key to good kiting is DoT. this is because if it hits it always does full damage givin the time to do it. So the only thing kiters fear is frizing spells. you take the same monster with a equal level DD caster and he runs out of mana way before the thing is dead.. My solution? Have DoT spells do partial damage just like DD spells, not all the time but some times. This will make the kiter think if he will have enough mana to finnish that monster. I believe that no single player should be able to kill a red monster unless it vary cripled to start with.
<P>Ok lets talk about this faction hit... I agree to a point that it is good. However.. Dark elves have no easy way to increase there faction with there own.. I had some guide tell me to basicly just die.. "why cant you root and run??" As if he did not understand a world of naked mages and multiple attackers.. One dark elf cant fight back for fear of becoming kos in his own city.. The pks dont care beacuse they just going for money to transfer to there main player so why do they care about faction? Every other race has a place where you can raise there faction.. My solution? Make the halfling camps in the forest increase de faction. I never understude why they did not. They are kos to the majority of DE's to start with. I was told by a Guild that I could kill humans, and other elves ( not npcs ) However this forces me to rollplay a PK when I do not want to be.. I will fight pvp for reasons that affect my player.. I dont want to be forced to pk just for faction sake!!!!
<P>How about AE spells.. they are unusable.. I mean why give a mage a ae spell?? it just hits it pet and then the pet kills the mage.. same goes with a wizard if you are partyed with a mage, necor, shamons at later levels.. This is also another easy fix.. make pets a part of your party.. party members dont get hit by AE spells.. why should party members pets???
