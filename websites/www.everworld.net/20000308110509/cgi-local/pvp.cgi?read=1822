<P>> This time I must say you posted w/o using Mr. Noggin.

<BR>&gt; 1. Your insinuation (sp?) is not appreciated.
<P>I insinuated that you slaughered some weakerr opponents. Yes I'll admit it was just flame bait to get my point across and try to shift a growing trend that is happening here.
<P>&gt; 2. The battle was ENTIRELY initated by the DEAD Humans present
<BR>&gt; who gathered an ARMY for an HOUR before we got tired of waiting
<BR>&gt; on them and went after THEM!
<BR>&gt; 3. Our attack occurred at THEIR guarded INN! They came out AT
<BR>&gt; US! We simply stood by while they, in an unorganized mob,
<BR>&gt; charged us and promptly got cremated. (tactics dear Watson)
<P>Now that's a lot more interesting. Screenshots would be more enjoyable if accompanied by this sort of dialog. Some tactical dteails would also be nice.
<P>&gt; Tactics are not for places like this to post, but suffice it to
<BR>&gt; say there there ARE tactics in MASS PvP and we DO USE them!
<P>This is definitely the place to discuss tactics. For the most part I'd like to see if there are certain tactics that fail due to game limitations that might be corrected, or tactics that should work but don't for similar reasons.
<P>&gt; The thing that surprises me most is your comment about us
<BR>&gt; attacking those of lower level...IS there NOT a level
<BR>&gt; restriction on PvP? Are you looking to narrow that restriction
<BR>&gt; further? Are the Humans involved unaware of this? Why did they
<BR>&gt; HUNT US? They simply had ZERO organization and that, Mr. Black,
<BR>&gt; is why they lay DEAD on the ground.
<P>I think it's great that you killed those humans. That's what the server is for.
<P>&gt; Listen bro, the PvP server is just that. PvP. Why do you condemn
<BR>&gt; us for PvPing then? In Character no less? This was a RACE war
<BR>&gt; sure as day JUST like I believe the developers planned. Good
<BR>&gt; against Evil. They knew we were there. They prepared themselves.
<BR>&gt; How else would so many bodies litter the ground? How many do you
<BR>&gt; think escaped? My god man; You can imagine that at least the
<BR>&gt; same number escaped that lay dead on the ground, thus how was it
<BR>&gt; an unbalanced fight when they obviously had such numbers? How
<BR>&gt; can we fight then at all with such criticism? Are we to always
<BR>&gt; ask ourself: "Sheesh, is Mr. Black going to be upset by
<BR>&gt; this slaughter?"
<P>&gt; Like I said before, I usually enjoy your ideas and posts. This
<BR>&gt; time, however, I think you insulted where nothing was done
<BR>&gt; except some good old fashioned organized PvP. Can't believe I
<BR>&gt; have to defend this at all.
<BR>&gt; -Gray
<BR>&gt; To irritated to put any hyperlinks up.
<P>What I would like to see more on this forum are some discussons on EQ PvP tactics. What works well, what works too well, what doesn't work the way it should, and what doesn't work at all. The more open we are with our discussions and the more information we share, the more exposure we give to possible problems and areas that might undergo revision by Verant.
<P>Aside from all those reasons which I failed to state in my original post, I (and I'm sure others) are interested to hear about your battle. What took place, who died, who fought well, who ran away...these things are of interest to most of us and are definitely hard to discern from a dark screenshot image. Lets try and take it in that direciton instead of furthering the brief "we rocked you guys" posts with accompanying screenshot. My comments are of course intended for the entire EQ PvP community and not directed specifically at Gray's original post.
