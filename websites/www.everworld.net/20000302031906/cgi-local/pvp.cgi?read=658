<P>> Your right EQ is not UO , however EQ wants as much success as UO

<BR>&gt; so it is only common sense to find the strong points from UO and
<BR>&gt; try and implememnt them here for greater success. If you are
<BR>&gt; foolish enough to think that EQ doesn't want bucks then I just
<BR>&gt; lost all respect for you.
<P>And if you think financial success is what makes a game, then I don't have any respect for you to begin with. Ultima Online was financially successful for two main reasons - in the early stages it promised things it had no ability or intentions of delivering and secondly in the later stages it attracted hordes of juvenile Pkillers who knew the system could be exploited to gain a "power trip." This demographic shift is much of what contributed to the downfall of UO.
<P>Financial success is ALL UO had. It was a poorly implemented system, a practical copy of single-player RPGs with an added "feature" of multiplayer, the only evidence of which was that you had a little bit of freedom to customize the appearance of your character. It promised hundreds of players and a huge, diverse world; and what it delivered was terrible lag and practically unplayable network performance for anyone with less than a cable modem or ISDN line. It also failed to deliver a challenge, as players sky-rocketed to max level and max skill points in no time flat. For God's sakes the company was SUED for what it promised and failed to deliver.
<P>If you think the fact that a game makes money qualifies it to be admired, think again. Many a game has been a financial success while being a terrible game.
<P>&gt; Oh and just so everyone knows not
<BR>&gt; everyone thought that rampant, random killing was a downside to
<BR>&gt; UO. Some people do, some don't simple fact.
<P>The only people who didn't think it was a downside were the people who perpetrated it. Of course they would be in favor of it! My impression is that EQ hopes to cater to more "sophisticated" crowd interested in more than just numbers ( level, gold, skill points, etc.). EQ hopes to be a roleplaying environment, not another stage for delinquent anger-venting.
<P>You can try to look at the strong points of UO all you want, but I can tell you right now, if you ever do find them, EQ already has them and more. Spend time on EQ, not reminiscing about UO.
