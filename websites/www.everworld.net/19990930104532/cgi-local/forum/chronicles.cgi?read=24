<P>Chapter VIII by Thorvard

<P>“Leave them be. They’ll die soon enough. Move!” Crimson turned and began marching off into he woods. Still shocked by the whole situation, his men followed, dragging Elenya with them.
<BR>“Lets move it men!” shouted Crimson. “We don’t want to be here when her uncle find’s out she’s missing.”
<BR>As they marched off, Elenya stumbled on a rock and fell to the ground. One of the orcs kicked her and pulled her up roughly by the hair. Suddenly the orc squealed, blood pouring from his eyes, ears and mouth. He seemed to be deflating, shriveling up as all of his life essence drained away. The orc fell to the ground, a shriveled husk. “Let that be a lesson to all of you,” said Crimson, his voice dripping with menace. “The enchantress is wanted alive and unharmed.”
<BR>There were some angry grunts from the few orcs that were left, but that didn’t stop them from swiftly looting the corpse of their dead comrade. “W-w-wanted?” stammered Elenya, visibly shaken. “Wanted by whom? What is going on?”
<BR>Crimson regarded her disdainfully, his cold gaze made her skin crawl. She shuddered under his scrutiny. “You will find out soon enough, perhaps sooner than you would wish.” They moved on, leaving the dead orc where it lay. The horses were not far away.
<BR>“Fornak, Gar,” Crimson called over two of his men. “Tie her up and gag her. I will hold you two responsible for her safety until we reach our destination. I want no more surprises tonight.”
<BR>“Yes Mi’Lord,” they replied. They were hard looking men, mercenaries, by the look of them. The two men swiftly and expertly tied her up. After a brief inspection of her bonds, Crimson ordered everyone to mount up. The two men placed Elenya on a horse and lashed her hands to the saddle. She noticed one of the other men staring at her with a sly look in his eyes. He was dressed a bit differently than the others. He quickly turned his head when he saw that she was looking at him.
<BR>They set out at a brisk pace, the horses well rested from the long wait. The orcs trotted along behind them. They traveled in silence for a while, with only the sound of hooves and the occasional snort of the horses. Elenya could see no hope of escape. They had traveled for about an hour at a fast pace when Crimson called for a halt.
<BR>“This is where we split up,” said Crimson. “The main group will head west, the rest of us will head directly for our rendezvous with the necromancer.”
<BR>“I don’t like this idea.” said a large bald mercenary. “How are we going to get paid if we split up? And that uncle of hers has a nasty temper I hear. He’ll be hot on our trail before long.” There were a few murmurs of agreement among the men.
<BR>Crimson glanced sharply at the group of mercenaries, the murmuring ceased. He turned his attention to the bald one. “Are you challenging my leadership, Tadrand?” he asked, his voice deceptively calm.
<BR>Tadrand’s face suddenly lost all color. “No Mi’Lord!” he exclaimed. “It’s just that I thought...”
<BR>“You’re not being paid to think!” roared Crimson. “You will all be paid when the job is completed. You have your orders. When you are sure that you aren’t being followed, double back and catch up to us. Fornak, Gar and Borath you are with me. The rest of you get moving!”
<BR>Elenya noted that the man named Borath was the same man that was staring at her earlier. She watched the main group depart and head west. Her spirits sank when she realized that her chances of rescue were now much reduced. At least now she was free from the stink of the filthy orcs.
<BR>“Let us make haste!” said Crimson. “Time is short. Borath, your job will be to cover our tracks for 5 rods, then catch up to us.” With that said he headed south with the others following behind.
<BR>“You can count on me Mi’Lord!” Borath shouted to his departing leader, but his eyes were on Elenya. ‘Such a lovely girl,’ he thought as he watched her ride off with the others. ‘Tis a shame, she won’t look so pretty once the necromancer gets hold of her.’ He shook his head. “More is the pity,” he sighed, then began his task of covering their tracks.
<BR>They rode at a fast pace; soon the horses began to tire. Crimson signaled a halt near a stream. “We’ll water and rest the horses here for a few minutes, we still have a long way to go.” They dismounted and lead their horses to the stream. Fornak pulled Elenya off her horse and led it to the stream as well.
<BR>Elenya used this chance to stretch her legs. She was tired and thirsty. She couldn’t understand why any of this was happening. She had no enemies that she could recall: certainly no one that would go to all this trouble. And who was this necromancer that Crimson mentioned? She didn’t know any necromancers. She looked at the water in the stream, her throat was parched. Then she heard Crimson’s voice behind her. “Would you like a drink of water?” Almost as if he were reading her mind.
<BR>She turned around and looked him in the eyes. There was no look of concern about him at all. He was just looking after his “investment”. She nodded her head.
<BR>Crimson studied the enchantress for a moment. “If I remove your gag you are not to try any spells, understood?” he said it more like an order than a question. “Remember, I can lay you out with a word. You can travel in the saddle or across it. The choice is yours.” Elenya nodded her head once again.
<BR>“Gar.”
<BR>“Yes Mi’Lord?”
<BR>“Remove the gag from the lady.”
<BR>Gar approached Elenya and began to remove her gag. “You want me to untie her hands also?”
<BR>“No, her hands are to remain tied. See that she drinks some water”
<BR>“Yes Mi’Lord.”
<BR>Gar finished removing the gag and led her to the stream’s edge. He helped her to kneel down and drink some water. She drank deeply, the cool water of the stream was very refreshing. She let Gar know that she had enough to drink. He helped her back to her feet. “Thank you,” she said.
<BR>Gar looked surprised at first. Then he scowled. “Don’t thank me lady,” He growled. “You’ll be cursing me soon enough, you have no idea what the necromancer has in store for...”
<BR>“You talk too much, Gar,” interrupted the shadow knight tersely, glaring at the mercenary. “Go fetch us something to eat, and be quick about it.”
<BR>“Yes Mi’Lord,” replied the now sweating Gar. “Sorry Mi’Lord.” he turned and made his way swiftly to the horses and began rummaging about in the saddlebags.
<BR>Elenya turned to face Crimson. “What did he mean by that?” she asked. “Who is this necromancer? What has he got planned for me?”
<BR>“You ask too many questions. You shall find out soon enough,” he replied with an evil grin.
<P>Taurmon was angry. He and his men had wasted too much time. They had followed the wrong trail, and when they caught up to the abductors his niece was not among them, nor was the man with the flaming red hair, Crimson. They had given them the slip somehow, and to add insult to injury, he had lost one of his men in wiping out that small band of rag tags. They had to double back and try to find where it was that they left the main group. Hours were wasted and their horses were tired. His thoughts were interrupted by one of his men.
<BR>“Taurmon! Look up ahead. There is someone just off the trail.”
<BR>“Capture him!” he shouted, drawing his sword. They took off with a burst of speed and surrounded the the figure. Taurmon recognized this elf. It was Glodain, who he had encountered earlier. “Relax men,” he said, sheathing his sword. “This is not the one we seek.”
<BR>“Hail, Taurmon,” greeted Glodain. “I have some news for you. I have found the trail of the ones who we seek.”
<BR>“Hail, and well met!” shouted Taurmon, greatly relieved. “Come with us if you will. As you can see, we have some spare horses now. Their former owners will not miss them I’ll warrant.”
<BR>“I will be most pleased to accompany you,” replied the footsore Glodain. “But we will have to await the rising moon. They made some attempt to hide their trail. It will be too sore a trial to follow in the dark I fear.”
<BR>“More delay!” growled Taurmon. “Dismount men, we will rest the horses now and we will ride with the rising of the moon!”
<BR>The elves dismounted for a much needed rest.
