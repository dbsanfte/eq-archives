<P>> Just people we dont like. ;)

<P>Preamble:
<BR>Radinn is an Erudin Enchanter. He had been to rivervale once before after his Highpass journey at lvl 4, and had made a friend or two in the Rivervale area.
<P>Now at lvl 6 he decided to return, and adventure with his friend.
<P>Situation:
<P>In the back of the Misty Thicket there is a cave to Runnyeye, the local goblin home. Radinn had camped for the night, and was now ready for find this halfling friend.
<P>Turning invisible he entered Misty was standing on the wall near the cave to Runnyeye. There was type typical battle going on with Goblin Warriors by a small group of two halfings and one gnome. After con'ing the PCs and goblins the battle looked to go to the side of the players, so Radinn started to talk with his friend about meeting up in a few minutes.
<P>Now that the battle was complete I could the small group running around below me then stop and rest. Also the saw the gnome staring in my direction. I was now visible but taking any actions.
<P>The small group then stood up and turned in my direction. I said hi about the time the gnome rooted me. Next i was being pounded by magical damage by a gnome and a halfing cleric or druid. The halfing warrior enguaged me in melee combat. All this within a few seconds. I did not have gate memorized, as i was prepared for a sealthy journey and not for direct combat. The only spell i managed to get off was invisibility, which was useless by then as the the spells and melee had me near death. Seconds later Radinn was dead.
<P>In talking to one of the halfings, who I had seen before in river but we did really know each other. I asked why I was attacked. The answer was that his guild brother (gnome) wanted to kill me, and he had to help him because he was CC. Next I talked to the gnome. His answer was that 'I am a PK.' There it is. There was no attempt to communicate with me before the event. I made to threatning moves towards anyone, and now a gnome who was himself a recent new comer to River decided my fate, because in his words 'I am a PK.'
<P>I would call this random killing. I would call this cold blooded murder.
<P>Misc:
<P>I have another another character who has spent a good deal of time in Rivervale from the beginning of P4. He personally knows the two halfings who attacked Radinn. Although they have been civil to him, he has seen quite a number of conflicts involving CC people in the area. The answer is often similiar to the gnome's 'I am a PK.' The wordy version is "This is the PvP server. I am a PK.'
<P>I recognize that some people like the power of playing a serial killer. I don't happen to be one of them. My self and others have noticed that these people tend to play gnome and halfing spell casters.
<P>My overall impression of CC is that they are an uncivilized lot who will build their reputation based on the power of murder.
<P>All this is my subject view(s). Based on experiences with CC on Rallos Zek. I don't yet condemn the whole organization, but I can say I have not meet anyone who I felt was worth of any real trust. And I (real life) am i trusting person.
<P>Anyone else who has experiences with this organization please post your comments. If you are a member of CC please say so up front.
<P>Thanks, and see you in the EQ world.
<P>Radinn the craftkeeper.
