<P>Republic of Freeport - Public Statement

<BR>(ROFREFID: 7CF50C8B6)
<P>Over a month ago, the Republic of Freeport was started. Its purpose was to supply residents of Freeport a true virtual community comprised of politicians, merchants, diplomats, fighters, etc.
<P>After the Republic of Freeport held its first City Meeting on April 24, 1999, Krozy, the organizational manager/leader, was approached by Bamador. Apparently, Bamador had similar ideas and was gathering a following of his own. During the two weeks that followed, Krozy & Bamador were in conflict as individual views could not be agreed upon. Luckily, progression has been made since that point, but it did leave its impact upon the community.
<P>Following the second City Meeting held on May 8, 1999, Bamador suggested an idea which sparked into the multiple Republic concept. One for each city. The Republic of Freeport has been waiting for other like organizations to form.
<P>To those of you with interest in joining or forming a city based player run government type guild, I feel compelled to tell you that it takes alot of work to get these kinds of groups working efficiently and effectively. But, once everything falls into place, the effort will be well worth it. If you want to truly feel a part of the world, to really live it, then this is the kind of thing to do.
<P>If you create or join a city based guild of this type, remember the reasons for doing so, and always keep in mind the local environment. Various races should and shall have differing forms of government. Even different cities of the same race could have a differing view on how things should be done. Do not feel as though you must fit into a 'cookie-cutter' type of organization matching those already in existance. Shape it the best way you know, the best way you feel, and how your heart tells you.
<P>I wish all future government guilds that are to be created the best of luck, and shall grant knowledge and opinions upon request.

<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=50 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; Republic of Freeport - Public Statement 
&gt; (ROFREFID: 7CF50C8B6) 

&gt; Over a month ago, the Republic of Freeport 
&gt; was started. Its purpose was to supply 
&gt; residents of Freeport a true virtual 
&gt; community comprised of politicians, 
&gt; merchants, diplomats, fighters, etc. 

&gt; After the Republic of Freeport held its 
&gt; first City Meeting on April 24, 1999, Krozy, 
&gt; the organizational manager/leader, was 
&gt; approached by Bamador. Apparently, Bamador 
&gt; had similar ideas and was gathering a 
&gt; following of his own. During the two weeks 
&gt; that followed, Krozy &amp; Bamador were in 
&gt; conflict as individual views could not be 
&gt; agreed upon. Luckily, progression has been 
&gt; made since that point, but it did leave its 
&gt; impact upon the community. 

&gt; Following the second City Meeting held on 
&gt; May 8, 1999, Bamador suggested an idea which 
&gt; sparked into the multiple Republic concept. 
&gt; One for each city. The Republic of Freeport 
&gt; has been waiting for other like 
&gt; organizations to form. 

&gt; To those of you with interest in joining or 
&gt; forming a city based player run government 
&gt; type guild, I feel compelled to tell you 
&gt; that it takes alot of work to get these 
&gt; kinds of groups working efficiently and 
&gt; effectively. But, once everything falls into 
&gt; place, the effort will be well worth it. If 
&gt; you want to truly feel a part of the world, 
&gt; to really live it, then this is the kind of 
&gt; thing to do. 

&gt; If you create or join a city based guild of 
&gt; this type, remember the reasons for doing 
&gt; so, and always keep in mind the local 
&gt; environment. Various races should and shall 
&gt; have differing forms of government. Even 
&gt; different cities of the same race could have 
&gt; a differing view on how things should be 
&gt; done. Do not feel as though you must fit 
&gt; into a 'cookie-cutter' type of organization 
&gt; matching those already in existance. Shape 
&gt; it the best way you know, the best way you 
&gt; feel, and how your heart tells you. 

&gt; I wish all future government guilds that are 
&gt; to be created the best of luck, and shall 
&gt; grant knowledge and opinions upon request.
