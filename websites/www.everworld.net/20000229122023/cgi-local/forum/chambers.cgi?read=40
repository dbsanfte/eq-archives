</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#F4D99F FACE=arial>
<P>> I believe that extending EQ's model of

<BR>&gt; monster races would be one of the better
<BR>&gt; ways to provide everquest with a fun twist,
<BR>&gt; and could be a very natural extension to the
<BR>&gt; game! Here's some of my thoughts. Anyone
<BR>&gt; want to comment?
<P>On This part I agree, it would be most interesting and amusing to expand our race options in such a way.
<P>&gt; Playing monster races would help clean up
<BR>&gt; alignment issues related to good/evil.
<BR>&gt; Monsters can be played as "good"
<BR>&gt; monsters or "evil" ones (within
<BR>&gt; the monster player races), but they should
<BR>&gt; never be allowed to group with parties of
<BR>&gt; normal race PC's. I think this is a current
<BR>&gt; flaw in Everquest's alignment model because
<BR>&gt; races that hate each other based on faction
<BR>&gt; standing (such as Dark Elves vs. High Elves)
<BR>&gt; should not be allowed to group together to
<BR>&gt; accomplish a common goal--they would rather
<BR>&gt; kill each other instead.
<BR>&gt; The current races of Dark Elf, Troll and
<BR>&gt; Ogre would cleanly transition to Monster
<BR>&gt; classes.
<P>This is where I must disagree, by making such grouping rules as these, you would to a great extent cripple alternative methods of roleplay in EverQuest. Anyone who wished to break the set mold for their race or class would be crippled, their freedom to roleplay stripped. Just because the races of High Elf and Dark Elf typically hate each other, that does not exclude the possibility of a High Elf who is evil, and kills many of the forces of good, seeking to increase faction with Neriak. It also does not exclude the possibility of a Dark Elf, either because he wanted to be good, or if he only wished to appear good for deceptive purposes, killing many orcs in the elven lands, to gain their approval. You see, there are many ways to roleplay, and implementing this restrictive part of your suggestion would destroy many of them. You would essentially be saying it is impossible for the evil races to ever be good, or even neutral, and that the good and neutral races would never be allowed to be evil. I ask you this, if your rule was implemented, what would become of Human, Gnome, and Erudite Necromancers? What of Human ShadowKnights? Those of these professions are truly welcome only in Neriak, and your rule would not only cripple role-playing effectiveness, but in the case of those classes, their effectiveness in the game.
