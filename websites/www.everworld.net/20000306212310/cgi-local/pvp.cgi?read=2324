<P>okay, taking a page, or a whole book is completely assinine - can i go buy "a rusty spell" for real cheap? no.... a fighter can buy cheap everything, in any city, barring faction, weapons and armor is easy to get anywhere! A warrior can bag their stuff, but are ususally to brainless to do so - only wear your sunday polishid fightin armor in groups of 6 ppl or 5 - this is how i have to play my necro for $%^'s sakes! you think a caster should have no mana upon coming back, have to mem spells, and you all even want to make entire pages, or books lootable? yer fried! hows this for positive thinking, and PLEASE!!!!! if you like or dislike the idea, it does not matter - take from the idea, and email verant at eqfeedbacl@verant.com, and either build upon, modify, or rip apart my suggestion as you see fit, but all the stupid assed bitching and whining i see here does no one any good but us players (if i am wrong, apologies to the verant ppl who pay attention to any of these threads - gawd, where would you find the time!) but most of all, don't send the whole class to detention cuz little billy threw a piece of chalk at the teacher... just take away little billy's chalk. by this i mean cuz a few casters exploited the system, do not punish all the casters... what we need is this : If you get killed, no matter what class you are, you and your killer may not attack each other for a set (by verant)period of time - do this after one or two kills, whatever, i don't care, but don't take our mana, spells, and armor away from us casters just cuz a few game exploiters are screwing the fighter types over - save the fighters, not punish ALL of us casters! i think thats all ppl - by now everyone hates me n will flame me, but i don't really care - i am only trying to make a good game better - not that verant helps anything by fixing code problems, or faction hits, which makes players argue and fight unnessesarily, and also here is one last point : i firmly am believing that verant wants to slow the game down as much as possible to make more cash - i know this sounds shallow n stuff, but if you owned sony, etc, and wanted to keep customers, you would exploit any way you could to make ppl buy more account time : if casters come back without mana or spells etc, this does nothing more than waste our damned time, and i for one will quit the game. i again point out that fighters can buy cheap armor anywhere - one guy (Squigge, i like ya on RZ bro, but yer opinion on what to do about naked mages is totally screwed up. Drzaan said this :P) Squigge wants casters so totally screwed over, that we would never be able to level! stop punishing, and prevent the prob;em, not add to it!

&gt; yer fried! hows this for positive thinking, and PLEASE!!!!! if 
&gt; you like or dislike the idea, it does not matter - take from the

&gt; but all the stupid assed bitching and whining i see here does no

&gt; where would you find the time!) but most of all, don't send the 
&gt; whole class to detention cuz little billy threw a piece of chalk

&gt; mean cuz a few casters exploited the system, do not punish all

&gt; matter what class you are, you and your killer may not attack

&gt; mana, spells, and armor away from us casters just cuz a few game 
&gt; exploiters are screwing the fighter types over - save the 
&gt; fighters, not punish ALL of us casters! i think thats all ppl - 
&gt; by now everyone hates me n will flame me, but i don't really 
&gt; care - i am only trying to make a good game better - not that 
&gt; verant helps anything by fixing code problems, or faction hits,
