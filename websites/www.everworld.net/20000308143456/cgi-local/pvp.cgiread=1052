<P>> Ok, I had a blast until I decided to leave Nektulos. I zoned and

<BR>&gt; die to 5 foul mouthed halfings before I even got control of my
<BR>&gt; character. Then I proceeded to die 4 more times as they camped
<BR>&gt; the zone area and my corpse. They only left when I /tell them
<BR>&gt; that I was of a low level and losing nothing....with these
<BR>&gt; remarks "screw this that guy isn't even losing levels lets
<BR>&gt; move on". Translation: We're not ruining his character this
<BR>&gt; sucks.
<P>Is it not coincidental that CC is playing as HAlfings? Why can I imagine that this is indeed perhaps their handy work? (Heh....time for some flaming....GO ON yah Putzes *grins* WE LIKE WAR So there!) In any case, Chris, please come by and visit with us. All of the current Dbers are Veterens of many pvp battles agaist CC and other guilds in UO and we are ALL Dark Elves (though we have other characters too). We will continue this into EQ retail as well, even if our numbers have significantly been reduced with our departure from UO 6 months ago.
<P>There are 7 or 8 of us playin P4 which is not a HIGH number by any means, but will be our core until some recruiting can be done in game for some cool and worthy bros.
<P>Also, it might be a good idea to /who on a zone before venturing to far in it. If you suspect an ambush then run quickly through any likely hiding spots to see if you are chased (IE Zone entry areas). Also, have a mage or wizard cast 'see invis' on you so they cannot ambush you as easily.
<P>The corpse camping is surely an issue which must be resolved. I am thinkin' that after the baddies get their loot from your corpse you will simply resurrect with all your stuff on you. They will have maybe 1 minute to loot your corpse while you are in limbo.
<P>&gt; Yeh this is partly a whine about players but also to point out
<BR>&gt; fundamental problems with geography. Most all of the good races
<BR>&gt; have many zones they can move into and exist next to other
<BR>&gt; allied races. Dark Elves have to stay confined and
<BR>&gt; consequentally bored to death in their own zone for a very long
<BR>&gt; time. Its not an easy run to troll and ogre lands even in a pve
<BR>&gt; server. Its near impossible with idiot camping 'roleplaying'
<BR>&gt; good races killing you before you can even zone completely. I am
<BR>&gt; not sure if ogres\trolls have similar geography problems. I
<BR>&gt; suppose this isn't a problem to folks who only think of
<BR>&gt; leveling, but I also play this game for fun and at least limited
<BR>&gt; exploration.
<P>I see the trouble. These guys were camping at the zone to Ecommons yes? As soon came through you were bombarded by magic and swords. Such geniouses these guys are *sighs*. Why does this seem like a strategy employed by a certain guild sitting inside the entryway of Dungeon Covetous? It forced OSI to make field spells illegal in this area. I think Verant will have to make a player immune to attack right after he zones in until he takes a step or two away from a zone point or until he acts in an agressive manner. This will force the ZONE campers to go elsewhere for their foolishness.
<P>&gt; I expect no changes in players but.....it would sure be nice to
<BR>&gt; have some sort of underground riverboat trip from Neriak to the
<BR>&gt; ogre\troll lands. As it is dark races are outnumbered, Dark
<BR>&gt; Elves aren't a super race to offset this, they are hampered from
<BR>&gt; the get go by this confinement to one zone and no grouping with
<BR>&gt; our fellow dark warrior races.
<P>I agree. It kinda sucks that we don't get to interact with our Troll and Ogre Brethren more. Though it is early yet in the game, it is a LONG trip to their lands which are adjacent to each other, but if you move along one can make the jouney in 30 mins or so. Also, have you gone to Lavastorm? It is another place to go from Nektulos that I believe borders no other racial zone. The only other choice is to adventure with your bros. Come visit us if you like. Nothin' fancy to be sure as far as web site goes (workin' on that), but we have a message board so we can communicate.
