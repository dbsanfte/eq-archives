</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> I suggested to Brad that certain items be marked as

<BR>&gt; non-lootable. Items in this category would be those obtained
<BR>&gt; from quests for certain. Also this should be contingent on
<BR>&gt; fixing the looting bug with monsters as well. Perhaps if there
<BR>&gt; was a way to designate a single item on ones person beyond this
<BR>&gt; as non-lootable, that should be fair enough.
<P>Making certain items non-lootable based on how easy or hard they are to get sounds like a jim dandy idea at first, but think about it for a moment. What happens when we are level 40-50 and every single item we have either comes from a level 50 monster, a high-level dungeon, or an incredibly complex quest? We have suddenly become immune to looting by default. Every single one of our items is non-lootable. Thus, above and beyond the fact that our level makes us incredibly powerful, our equipment is now no longer subjected to the abuse of the lower levels. This means at higher levels, PVP will basically become a battle to see who can make who lose the most experience in the shortest amount of time, and nobody wants to see a degradation into that type of war. Unless some prestige system is implemented which benefits characters SIMPLY for killing, then high-level PVP will become pointless and boring.
<P>A solution? How about a quest or spell or skill which allows you to magically 'claim' one item for yourself, thus binding it magically to your body. Then you could simply be limited in the number of 'claimed' items you can have at once, total (in bank and on body.) Three or four would be a reasonable number, I think. So you could claim a nice weapon, your body armor, and one or two other magical items. This way, even low level players who have not had time to collect these awesome items can benefit from un-lootable status. And this way, high level players who have 20+ AWESOME items on their body, must make a decision between the FEW they want to definitely keep, and must expect the others to be sought after by playerkillers. I think this is a great idea, anybody agree?
