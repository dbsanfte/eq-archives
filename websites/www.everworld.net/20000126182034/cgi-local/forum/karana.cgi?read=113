<P>When she getts back she see's a man clad all in black with a dark mask on leaning on her flag pole. He doesn't seem to notice her, or at least care she is there until she is almost on top of him. Though she had no intention of passing him he swings our his arm and stops her from moving. "Excuse me," he says with little remorse as to if he hurt her or not, "but I have a message for you." He pushes off the pole and stand infront of her easily intimidating even some brave souls. "Apperantly the necromancer that rules my world was very greatful for the bonechips, and would like to repay you. I don't know why he sent me, but he did, so don't expect any sentament." He takes out a small amulet and rubs it while chanting something unintellegable.

<P>Out of nowhere an army of skeletons walks up, each holding a strange looking plant. They assemble all around the flag one feet away from each other. The man in black rubs the amulet again and chants something else. All the skeletons look to him then to the ground. In unison they place their plants on the ground keeping them only one foot apart. They all straighten up and then collapse in a heap around the plant. The magic that had held them together shimmers for a few seconds then flows into the plants. Each plant starts twitching and growing with amazing speed. They shoot to the sky, twisting and turning, joining with eachother into massive walls of wood. After less then a minute they stop and standing before the startled half elf is an enormouse cottage of intertwining vinelike plants.
<P>As she stares wide eyed at her "gift" the from door opens and the man in black walks out. "Oh, and it's Syth, if you care." Not even caring about any responce he walks away.
