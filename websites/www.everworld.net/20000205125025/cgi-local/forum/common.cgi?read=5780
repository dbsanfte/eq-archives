<P>Why is it that other hybrids only get double attack or dual wield, while rangers get double attack & dual wield, they also get kick to attack magical guys, while large warriors can't slam magical guys. Im not suggesting that rangers be weakened, since they don't get plate i consider giving them both of the attacks a good trade-off. but rangers are 3/4 warrior, yet there attacking capabilities are exactly the same, same caps in almost all melee skills + spells. But warriors should be stronger. These are what i suggest

<BR>1) Extra attack for every 10 levels starting at 30 with triple hit, and going on with 4 hits and 5 hits. Doing this with warriors would make them more formidabble to fight mobs without having 20 of them taking on 1 mob.
<BR>2) Warriors need 10-20 hp's extra a level, 3-5 hp's a level does not effect us enough to make a difference.
<BR>3) Make it possible to use slam/bash & kick at the same time, Yes i know that means monks can use all their special attack, but that would keep them doing more dmg than a warrior with 5attacks, up to 10 with double hit a round.
<BR>4) Add another off-hand attack. Like head butt or sucker punch, that can stun and do a nice amount of dmg(10-20).
<BR>5) Give more class related armor types at ALL levels, not just high lvl's so that ALL classes can look unique at ALL lvl's.
<BR>Warriors have the possibiltiy of being the most fun and most played class, which they should be, since they are the core of a group and the core of every other RPG I have played. I'm not suggesting weakening any melee classes to make warriors more powerfull, just make warriors better. If Verant would stop worrying about casters and making everyone like them, then they could start fixing up the base of a group. Right now rangers/paladins/sk's are the prefered tanks for most groups at most lvl's since they can do the same dmg, and heal themselves in 1 fashion or another, but they are 3/4 warrior, so they should be 25% weaker than a warrior, not equal. Exp hits do not make a class weaker, they just make it longer to lvl. Many mid- high lvl warriors are dumping there warrior classes since they have nothing to look forward too after 25-30. Disarm might have been a good skill if it worked on magical weapons, but paying 10$ a month to have the sole purpose of absorbing dmg, is not what verant should be looking for. Warriors should be the class that takes dmg, but they should also be fun to play with multiple attacks and many other skills. Please respond to what I had to say, My ideas have been well thought out and I have chatted with many many warriors/hybrids and casters. I know the arguments why warriors shouldn't be more powerfull, and really i find most of them are weak. Hybrids should be weaker than rogues, in my opinion, since rogues are a pure melee, while hybrids are only part melee, but as it seems hybrids are more than pure melee.
