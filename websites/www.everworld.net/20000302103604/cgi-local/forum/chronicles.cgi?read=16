<P>Chapter VII by Cathal

<BR>“Nay,” Taurman said “You would only slow us down and your companions look none too well to travel. I feel we can catch them soon if we hurry. Thank you for your offer and may your god be with you.”With not another word Taurman turned with his men and rode off afterElenya’s abductors. Glodain watched them go, he wanted to yell at themto stop but he new it would be a waste of breath. He looked at E’gail,she was a mess. Her hair was sticking out at odd angles due to thebandage and blood and grime, she looked quite pale and wobbly as if herlegs wouldn’t hold her up much longer. Pigorsh was sitting on the groundlooking at something he had recovered from the dead shamen’s pack, he didn’t look too well either. Glodain let out a deep breath and startedgathering up some of the still useful things around the ruined camp.He knew he couldn’t abandon his companions to pursue his enemy. He wouldhowever follow Taurman as best as he could. He wouldn’t lose the shadowknight again.”We must get away from here, with all the blood and noise no tellingwhat will be brought in.” Glodain called out to the others. “Grabanything useful and lets get out of here.” His voice was dead and flat,he didn’t know why he was still alive and didn’t care either. He wouldtake care of his friends first and then go after his enemy.After Glodain recovered most of the things that looked useful and helpedE’gail get some of her belongings together he noticed Pigorsh stillsitting on the ground staring at the thing in his hands. Glodain walkedover to his friend.”Pigorsh!” He shouted.Pigorsh jumped at the sound of his voice and stuffed the thing back inthe pack as quick as he could. It was pale and ovoid and would have fitin the palm of Glodain’s hand. Pigorsh glared up at Glodain and gave hima look that caused the hair on his neck to stand on end. Glodain tried to ignore the look and instead said, “So whats that thingyou have there?”
<BR>”Get away” Pigorsh shouted. He stood and shoved Glodain as hard as hecould, it didn’t do much good but Glodain backed up anyway.
<BR>“Whats wrong with you!?” Glodain grabbed the little gnome by the shoulders and shook him. He looked up with a confused look and said “Oh, I didn’t know it was you.” But then said “Whaddya got yer hands on me for? Let go!” Pigorsh jerked free and picked up his new found pack and put it on, walking away without saying anything more. Glodain, with a retort of his own looked at his friend’s retreating back but decided to drop it, he had enough to think about without wondering what was going through the irascible gnome’s head and getting into a shouting match with him. Soon they were on their way. Pigorsh was walking behind as Glodain and E”gail quietly talked. Pigorsh was somehow a little ashamed for lashing out at his friend but not enough to want to do anything about it. He thought it was good for his friend to be among his own kind. Glodain simply wasn’t the wondering type. He knew that someday his friend would go back to his own and was beginning to think that day was soon approaching. His head felt as if it were in a fog but was slowly clearing. He also still felt quesy. After several hours Glodain’s frustration was getting the better of him. They were making slow time and would never catch up with the others. E’gail was barely able to keep going at this point and was deathly pale. Pigorsh didn’t look a whole lot better but instead of white he was green and kept complaining about his stomach and describing what the contents of it would look like and how they would all regret seeing it if they didn’t stop soon. Glodain groaned inwardly. He would have to stop for the night and tend to his friends. He found a gully not far ahead with a tiny little stream flowing through it. The bottom of the gully was covered in ferns higher than Pigorsh’s head. It was also thick with huge yew trees, even in the present circumstances he had to marvel at the beauty of the place. He made a quick camp and helped clean everyone up in the stream. The water was bitingly cold but also very refreshing. E’gail looked much better afterwards and after a small meal laid down. Glodain was worried about her with her head wound but couldn’t do much about it, she was asleep in no time. Pigorsh seemed to be coming around rather quickly and was happily chewing on something from the shamen’s pack, Glodain knew better than to look to closely as to what it might have been.
<BR>“Pigorsh, I’m going to follow the trail and see what I can find out. Would you please stay here and take care of E’gail?” Glodain said it in such a way as to make it sound like an order and not a question. Even the word ‘please’ had a commanding tone about.
<BR>Pigorsh just looked at him like he had spoken utter gibberish, total incomprehension registering on his face. “What?”
<BR>”I need you to stay here and...” Glodain thought he better try aslightly different strategy, “and keep that girl out of mischief. Will you do that?”
<BR>”You want me to babysit her!? Yer one daft bastard you are.”
<BR>”That’s enough!” Glodain said through clenched teeth. “I must do this and I need your cooperation, you are to stay here and make sure nothing happens to her. Do you understand?” Glodain certainly wasn’t in the mood for jokes now.
<BR>”Sorry, you know I don’t mean nothin by it.”
<BR>Glodain didn’t acknowledge it. Instead he said in a slightly softer tone. “I will be back by morning, just keep out of trouble.”
<BR>”Aye, aye sir.”
<BR>Glodain followed the trail of men, orcs, and horses for some time. The sun had already dipped over the horizon but he was sure he could follow the trail in the dark, there could be no missing it. The trail suddenly veered off to the west when it had been going directly south, Glodain hurried along. It was getting dark quickly. Glodain knew he would never catch up with them, but he couldn’t stop. He could only think of the betrayal and of his kinsman being slaughtered. He was an outcast and had a hand in that betrayal because of this one man. He would stop him, or die trying, never giving up. They were heading due west now, he thought how strange when suddenly he stopped. A shiver ran up his back and lodged at the base of his head. If what he was thinking was correct then …
<BR>He made it back to the point where the trail had turned west with barely enough light left. He started casting about in widening circles until, when he was convinced he had been wrong, he found it. The party they were after had split up. Only three or four had gone this other way and after about a half mile turned back to the original southerly heading. They must have known they were being followed and split up. Elenya must certainly be highly valued for the shadow knight to split up his men like that. Either he was foolish or desperate, and Glodain did not think he was stupid. The night was upon him and he had to stop. They were now making some attempt to cover their trail and he would never be able to find it in the dark, he would wait till the moon rose in a few hours and see if he could follow the trail then.
<BR>Pigorsh held the object in both hands staring at it. It was a pale yellow with dark etchings covering its entire surface, almost looking like tiny runes. If he stared long enough at it he could just catch glimpses of flashes of red light coursing over its surface highlighting the tiny runes. He wondered how an orc shamen could have come upon such an obviously powerful magical item. He continued to stare at it and always just as he thought he was about to understand it’s meaning, he would lose it. He decided he needed to concentrate more. He closed his eyes and relaxed his body, he meditated until he felt himself cleared of the concerns of life and only then did he open his eyes to look at the object. The flashes of light appeared almost immediately playing over the surface of the sphere in seemingly random patterns. The shadows around him seemed to grow darker and close in, the forest disappeared around him. He heard whisperings in the shadows and out of the corner of his eyes he thought he could descern movement and even faces. He didn’t dare look for fear of losing the link to the orb. The flashing runes, for indeed he could now tell that they were runes, seemed to start making sense to him. The whisperings also became clearer, he could almost feel their breath on the back of his neck. Something in the back of his mind was screaming at him to break the link before it was too late.....
<BR>Good luck Thorvard, With the characters going in different directions itis getting very interesting. I wanted to bring Elenya into the story butcouldn’t do everthing, I also couldn’t figure out a decent way to bring in the new character.
