<P>Reading the past few post I think a lot of people defending the wizards are avoiding the loot answer. Sure there's still a lot of contention of whether wizards are powerhouses in PvP, but let me take something that happened over the weekend to prove a point.

<P>I was running around the plains of Everfrost being a happy Barbarian shaman (different character) when Bois (a teen level Shaman) called for people to assist him in killing bandits camping at the Blackburrow entrance. A group of ALL spellcasters (names gnome wizard Corpses, gnome wizard Corpsez, high elf spellcaster Nunkapto (sp?), and wood elf druid? Lanciatoku (sp?), all at least 14th since my 9th level self couldn't hit them. They would just wait by the BB entrance and hit whomever they could. They moved to the Qeynos Hills side due to lack of people their range. Then a massive spell battle ensued between them and Leorik (halfling druid), Bois (Barb shaman), Pimotan (human wizard?), and a couple other guys. What exactly happened? Basically they were all high level enough to have Bind and were bound close (probably entrance to Qeynos and Halas), one would eventually die, they would sit long enough for them to memorize ROOT and their highest level direct damage spell, then they would run back to Blackburrow entrance and start hitting the other team again. Eventually I think everyone simply just left their initial corpse where it was, and came back naked, starting the firefight all over. I watched this spectacle for about an hour till its got boring. They would do the same thing over and over again, die, remem two spells, then run back to start casting.
<P>I started thinking about this. Could a warrior do the same? No? In a battle like that the first thing that would happen would be when the warrior actually died his weapon would get stolen and maybe destroyed if the opponent thought the warrior might get it back. That's what I would do anyway if I wanted to keep a warrior from doing anything really nasty. A spellcaster has a distinct advantage that their spells don't take that long EACH to memorize, and that they have a quick recovery time, they restart with full mana so sometimes its even better to simply die than meditate back 400 mana. I'm merely saying that spellcasters should suffer the same drawbacks a fighter does, if yo kill a spellcaster I don't think they should lose a full complement of spells, but one spell would be enough. That way you could kill a spellcaster and gank his most used offensive spell, and now he's in the same boat as a warrior. Personally it may not look as damaging as a warrior losing a breastplate, but at the levels you usually get breastplate, the wizards usually have spiffy stuff of their own that is hard to replace. Its still not the greatest answer, but such an answer is quite difficult to come up with. How's this for an answer? Making only money lootable, then reinstall the XP penalty for dying. Oh now that WOULD suck wouldn't it? >:) Basically I don't know if wizards are the kings of PvP (though they are a major player), but spellcasters on a whole have a definite advantage in the PvP looting scenario.
<P>Am I wrong? Lemme know.
