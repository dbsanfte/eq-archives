<P>> If you hate that guy who zaps you while you're low on HP and

<BR>&gt; have your back turned fighting a monster, I want to join you. If
<BR>&gt; he took your only item worth spit, I want to help.
<P>&gt; If your in any Elf zone (especially Greater Faydark), just OOC
<BR>&gt; "I want to hunt ZARAKON!" and if I or any of my guild
<BR>&gt; are on, we will respond.
<P>Zarakon has been a long time murderer of wood elves. I fear his caracter exists only to harvest items for another character. Which, is what bothers me the most. The naked pkers like Civil, Ingrid, Cumming, and Zarakon that hang out in front of CB and harvest items. They are always there in force and they are always naked.
<P>What is wrong with this? Well, on the surface nothing is wrong with it. They add a level of random violence to the game that is realistic. One must learn to watch her back. But at a deeper level there is a massive imbalance. Faction. If a wood elf has ruined his factions in thier home land, why should another wood elf suffer the same faction loss by killing this murderus scum? This is not right, we should not question those who hold up the truth.
<P>This is a big hole in the new faction rule. I have seen players not willing to help their own kin if fear of faction loss, when they know they attacker is a kin slayer. This could easily be fixed by adding the oppisite faction that the attacker currently has for their home land. If a wood elf has a negative standing in thier homeland, then anyone that kills this rouge elf promotes thier wood elf factions. And if the wood elf has a positive standing in their homeland ones wood elf faction should go down for slaying such and upstanding citizen. The servirity of the adjustment should be proportional to the faction standing. Very good and very bad standings would have greater adjustments then one who is closer to neutral.
<P>Another wishfull thought that I have is making the faction adjustments locatoin sensitive. Killing one on their home land is far more obvious then killing them when they are not.
<P>That is all I have for this rant =)
