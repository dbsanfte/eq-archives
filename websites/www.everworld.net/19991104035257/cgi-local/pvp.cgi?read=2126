<P>

<BR>Read my previous post. I think its hilarious that if a warrior gets killed and his weapon looted he's up a creak (sure, spare weapon, or grab a rusty weapon), but if a wizzy dies he just sits down, memorizes his nastiest spell and maybe Root, then goes and jumps the guys that killed him while they are still resting or fighting. Fail again? Repeat until enemy runs or dies. I don't mind the Root at all, what I mind is that warrior rely on equipment, and there IS a difference between a Shiny Brass Halberd and a Rusty Short Sword.
<P>I think being able to loot a spell (possibly spells) from a spellcaster is a perfectly good thing to do, and it will stop the "Return of the Wiz" syndrome that occurs so often (ie the med best offensive spell then return to scene of crime till you win method). I think everything is is "alright" for the most part, tweaking is needed but its not BAD, but the fact that pure spellcasters can get right back in the action while fighters have to get their corpse or hunt down a new weapon is something that needs to be addressed.

<P>&gt; NUMBER ONE I HAVE PLAYED A WIZARD
<BR>&gt; Okay I made two main points in my previous post
<BR>&gt; One was that wizards have nothing to lose when they pk relative
<BR>&gt; to a warrior as they can pk with any equipment what so ever.
<BR>&gt; -Someone responded saying that doesn't happen. To that
<BR>&gt; person-> you do not know what you are talking about, it does
<BR>&gt; happen and it happens alot especially amoung the random pk's a
<BR>&gt; 20th level wizard that pks like this a lot is Bakatu(sp?)
<BR>&gt; someone else said that wizards can lose stuff to that at 1th
<BR>&gt; level they have equipment that provides extra mana that can sell
<BR>&gt; for 30 plat
<BR>&gt; --> So waht I used the word relative for a reason, at 16th
<BR>&gt; level a warrior can lose a shiny brass halberd that sells for
<BR>&gt; 150 plat, that is like saying wizards have cloth armor you can
<BR>&gt; steal, big whoop relative to warriors its nothing.
<BR>&gt; --My POINT that these replied to was that I said that wizard
<BR>&gt; should just be able to be looted somehow to comprise this like
<BR>&gt; looting an entire rank of spells(which at 16th level does not
<BR>&gt; come close to 150 pp)no where did I say wizards are just plain
<BR>&gt; too powerful and that their spells should revole over just
<BR>&gt; different levels of conjuring light globes. I merely stated that
<BR>&gt; they dont lose nearly as much as warrior and that dorks are
<BR>&gt; exploiting this.
<BR>&gt; Secondly I talked about how gateing from fights suck,
<BR>&gt; Someone said it doesnt happen----> it does if I miss with a 2
<BR>&gt; hander once and miss with a slam a wizard can gate away. And
<BR>&gt; dont even say it happens cause i suck cause I dont the ability
<BR>&gt; to hit has to do with probibility, my att vs their ac. And it
<BR>&gt; does happen or the more popular way is to do the wizards verson
<BR>&gt; of shadowstep then gate, this works well cause you can stepp a
<BR>&gt; good distance from them, or shadowstep even behind your opponent
<BR>&gt; which gives you time, enough infact to gate it has been done to
<BR>&gt; me so I know, it has been done to others too.
<BR>&gt; Please make sure you understand my fucking post next time before
<BR>&gt; you reply and sound like an idiot again, not one time did I say
<BR>&gt; that wizards spells are too strong, or that root rocks you
<BR>&gt; morons! i did not mention root once! yet I had fools replying
<BR>&gt; about root! i could give two shits about root hasn't stopped me
<BR>&gt; yet! and never will! not cause of traveling boots but because I
<BR>&gt; am a prepared fighter unlike some, the are many tools thta can
<BR>&gt; help non casters, there are items that have the affect of cancel
<BR>&gt; magic, or bows something you can shoot while rooted, and sure a
<BR>&gt; bow doesnt do 170 damage but wizards do have less health so 20
<BR>&gt; is still good damage agaist them besides the fact that if you
<BR>&gt; interrupt their spell with it you waste their presious time
<BR>&gt; until you get unrooted!.
<BR>&gt; All I am saying is that I am sick of seeing all these wizard pks
<BR>&gt; running around with no equipment, or a full set of cloth armor
<BR>&gt; and pking people and taking shiny brass halberds, and the like
<BR>&gt; IN THAT SENSE IT IS WAY UNBALANCED. it has NOTHING to do with
<BR>&gt; things like ROOT, SPELL DAMAGE, or the rate at which a wizard
<BR>&gt; LEVELS!
