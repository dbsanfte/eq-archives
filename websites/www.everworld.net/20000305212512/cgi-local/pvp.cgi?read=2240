<P>I knew you where a spell caster! How I know? Because you dont get pked alot. Now before you go and say well I dont know what I am talking about. I too play a dark elf wizard.. And from the looks of what you wrote (use of root instead of enstill) you must be low level, at least lower then I am. The problem with pks will never fall on you as much as others. Why? true spell casters carry nothing of great value. Now I know it not true in all cases but this is the way it is. Spell casters are high risk low reward for pking.. They are hard to pin down, gating and what not, or shadow step. And you cant be sure you will get anything good. On the other hand, warriors and others "armor" wearing classes will feel the brunt of the pking. This is the truth behind most of the pking. I hate to say it but race war dont mean that much.. if a pk sees two woodelves one a warrior one a druid both same level.. warrior gets pked druid left alone. Armor wearing classes you can see that you will be getting something valueable from a distance. Warriers will not gate away, shadow step to some unknown place. And with a good root sit there and watch you kill them. You should try it some time.. bind sight, root and watch yourself blast your enemy to death :)The other thing why they are much better targets then spell casters is that they cant get back as fast for revenge.. My friend plays a cleric and he gets attacked way more many times then I do.. why is armor worth 20 plat.. my cloth is worth 2 gold.. who do you want to loot if your using your profet making pk player?
