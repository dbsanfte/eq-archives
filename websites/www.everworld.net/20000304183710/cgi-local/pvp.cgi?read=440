<P>RealmWeaver, While your heart is in the right place you are way off on a couple points in your editorial. Before starting, let me first state that I understand where you are coming from. I, too, also have developed and coded countless non-graphical MUD's, I officially work in programming as well, however the dozen MUD's I helped write are the only game programming experience I have.

<P>As you probably know, text-based MUD's are VERY different from the graphic MUD's we are so fond of this day in age. Many of the Anti-PVP limitations we used in those MUD's don't have a chance in complex games like EverQuest.
<P>First off, 99% of the persons who took part in MUD's are not the rapid blood-thirsty player killers that we came to know and love in games such as Ultima Online, Meridian 59, etc. The players you described as "bands of ranting, raving sociopathic teenagers roaming the lands killing newness by the dozen, cursing to high Heaven, and basically ruining everyone's day" simply do not have the patience nor self-control to play text-based MUD's. Even in the MUD's that placed no restrictions what so ever on player killing, you never saw anything near what we all witnessed in Ultima Online. The point I am trying to make is this -- The restrictions that kept player-killing in check on MUD's are drastically less than the ones necessary to keep the "bands of ranting, raving sociopathic teenagers roaming the lands killing newness by the dozen, cursing to high Heaven, and basically ruining everyone's day" from doing their stuff. The problem with huge restrictions terrible enough to frighten off the "sociopathic teenagers" also virtually eliminates the players who wish to participate in more spirited player-killing.
<P>You seem quite fond of the idea of NPC guards to limit player-killing. As much as this dream might appeal to anyone, it is FAR from a reality. Current Artificial Intelligence is, well… stupid. NPC "guards" have no ability to distinguish between PKing and RPKing. We witnessed this in UO with guards who laid waste to anyone and everyone. You might argue that the UO guards just "sucked", but that is not the case. The guards in Ultima Online nearly peaked off at current AI intelligence. The guards can be told to simply kill anyone who does this, and kill anyone who does that. It is impossible for any programmer to anticipate all the actions a guard must perform in order to wipe out PKing and encourage RPKing. Maybe someday in the near future we will witness the birth of smart NPC's that can differentiate between different human actions. However, current AI limitations placed on all programmers currently sends this dream to come to a crashing halt. (The same goes for the roaming bounty hunter type parties you mentioned)
<P>As for "administrator assigned guilds" that would stop abusive player-killing, I do not believe that administrative assistance is required. That is too subject to abuse, no matter how hand-selected the individuals are. They are and will always be anti-PK guilds, these, however, are normally seriously under-powered as the individuals in them are not as concerned with PVP combat as the excessive PKers are. Most PK guilds simply over-power/out-number them.
<P>Reputation System!? No offense, but you must be crazy. Have you forgotten your Ultima Online nightmares so soon? Reputation is simply too subject to abuse, without constant GM intervention we are doomed to see reincarnations of all the "Great Lord" PKers from UO. As with NPC AI, this is a very much desired feature, but simply is not possible with today's programming restrictions.
<P>Also, you mentioned in two sections about player-killing restrictions. (I do hope that I am not breaking my NDA by mentioning this) These are already in place in EverQuest, a player may not attack another player either 4 levels above, or 4 levels below their current level. (I.e. a level 20 can only attack a level 24 through level 16) I believe this is quite sufficient, since players are still allowed to engage in duels and this limit will be removed during guild wars.
<P>One idea that I do agree with, however, is the "Safe-Zones". These already exist in the game in small areas -- simply find the nearest guard post for your race/race allies. Any 100% safe zones implemented into the game would have to undergo extensive balancing. One issue would be that the player killers would receive just as much protection as a law-abiding citizen would. While I do believe that everyone should be safe in the areas, regardless of PVP or not, it would be subject to abuse as a safe-area out of combat to prevent death, as well as other abuses I am sure I did not take into consideration. I am confident that Verant Interactive can handle these, though. As long as they do not take as long to fix problem areas/features as the developers of UO and M59 took to fix their bugs, I do not foresee a problem.
<P>Let me just sum up with saying that the point of this post was not to bash down your ideas, Simply to help everyone understand that they are not possible with today's programming environment. There may be ways around it, UO tried to find them, but failed miserably. These are just too many billions of possible ways to abuse any system anyone comes up with. Without smarter computers being able to think for themselves, the prospect of a game handling the player-killing just will not happen. Verant would have to hire hundreds of individuals to devote their entire day just to stopping excessive and abusive player killing. They choose the simplest and most feasible route available to them at this time. I commend them for it, as it seems to be working almost perfectly.
