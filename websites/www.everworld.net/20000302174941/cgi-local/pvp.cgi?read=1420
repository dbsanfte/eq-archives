<P>The PvP server will definitley be there in final. I'll have to admit, at the beginning of phase 4 I thought it would take a bit longer for the PvP to fall in the place than it did. It was quite fun throughout the duration of phase 4, playing in the Race wars that happened. It wasn't often but enough that I saw people killing out of role that concerned me. My last night on the server, I logged in as a HighElf (known to have a great deal of charisma) and was immediately attacked by another Highelf with a moronic name. I know quite a few people that spent 12 hours a day on the server, neither were 100% sure they were going to play on the PvP server in the final. Not that they didn't have fun or didn't enjoy that extra drama that the PvP server, its just that the PvP server acted as a cap for their fun in the following ways:

<P>#1) If you play too much you will be so much higher than everyone else, you can't PvP or it will be as often as it is playing as PvP on a non PvP server.
<P>#2) You put in a great deal of hours and pick up a nice set of armor, only to find a group of people that think they'd look better in your armor than you do. In or out of role the time spent collecting your armor and weapons, it can be extremely frustrating.
<P>We have to face it, there are people out there that will do what ever makes them happy no matter what the cost. There will be people out there who like to play on the PvP server yet will PK new characters just because they can (Lvl 3 killing Lvl 1) and chase away people who will actually serve to ensure the life of the PvP server. A friend of mine was attacked by a darkelf infront of a guard. She (Dark Elf) was swiftly dispatched by the guard and my friend looted a nice shield from her. I personally see nothing wrong with this considering she iniated the combat, however her husband msg my friend out of role complaining that his wife didn’t know and she was mad at him now and “This isn’t about a game its about real life”. Talk about unrealistic epectations. A Wood Elf showing compasion for a Dark Elf that attacked him and then died and if he doesn’t he’s an “ASSHOLE”. BAH…
<P>Here is my take on where we go from here:
<P>I had a notorious Gnome Necro on the PvP server (It was one of the characters my roomate and I shared, but I played 90% with the Necro the few weeks before the end of the Beta).. I tasted PvP in many forms, killing Dark Elves and Trolls and the occasional Ogre, I never killed my own kind or any Humans that I can remember (that didn’t deserve it). My actions for the most part were a fairly accurate representation of what was going on, on the server. I wouldn’t call it killing in Role as much as I would call it killing in Race. Aside from the +/-4 lvl limit there isn’t much of a restriction on who you kill (no factions yet) this makes it quite difficult to rely on other people to “Kill right”. Another thing people forget is that just because this is a PvP server it doesn’t mean we have to spend all of our time on the server killing everything, or obtaining a lvl so you get cool spells to kill people. The server needs something. We need to police ourselves as to not destroy the freedom we have to PvP at will (+/-4). We need to throw some roleplay into our recipe.
<P>I would love nothing more than to spend all my time in Everquest enhancing everyone elses game play via Quests, roleplaying and indepth and detailed storylines. Is it going to be worth my effort? (My effort normally goes to the extreme when I do things) I don’t know if it will or won’t at this moment in time. The PvP server can’t and in my opinion won’t exist off of what we had towards the end of phase 4. It has the potential. I believe strongly that the problems don’t fall at all with the design of the game (which will continue to evolve a better pvp system) I think it has to do simply with the people. I had a lot of fun authoring some of the story line in the Sundering. (Ghuratan and Dhuratan and the begotten). I did so mostly on the fly, and PvP could have only enhaced that, however I don’t think it would have went as smooth as it did on the Non-PvP server. When it comes down to the PvP server, you’ll probably find people less concerned about role playing and more concerned about owning their fellow man. If we don’t get past this, everyone who really thirsts for Roleplay with either stay away or leave.
<P>Everyone take responsibility for your actions and the actions of your friends. We are the only ones that can ensure the successful life of the PvP server and have fun doing it. There is a perfect balance out there somewhere, I don’t know if we’ll ever find that “perfect balance” but, I think we can come close. As much as I like going on the Dark Elf hunts, its not enough and should be only a fraction of what we look to for fun. We need wars, drama, story lines and roleplaying, not just killing. We need to kill in role rather than just in race. If you’re a Human with Dark Elf friends and you want to hang with your buddies (which doesn’t seem quite right in role) come up with a story line that supports your alliance. We need to figure out viable fixes to the problems of Lvl and Loot.
<P>Its up to us.

&gt; fly, and PvP could have only enhaced that, however I don’t think 
&gt; it would have went as smooth as it did on the Non-PvP server. 
&gt; When it comes down to the PvP server, you’ll probably find 
&gt; people less concerned about role playing and more concerned 
&gt; about owning their fellow man. If we don’t get past this, 
&gt; everyone who really thirsts for Roleplay with either stay away 
&gt; or leave. 

&gt; Everyone take responsibility for your actions and the actions of 
&gt; your friends. We are the only ones that can ensure the 
&gt; successful life of the PvP server and have fun doing it. There 
&gt; is a perfect balance out there somewhere, I don’t know if we’ll 
&gt; ever find that “perfect balance” but, I think we can come close. 
&gt; As much as I like going on the Dark Elf hunts, its not enough 
&gt; and should be only a fraction of what we look to for fun. We 
&gt; need wars, drama, story lines and roleplaying, not just killing. 
&gt; We need to kill in role rather than just in race. If you’re a 
&gt; Human with Dark Elf friends and you want to hang with your 
&gt; buddies (which doesn’t seem quite right in role) come up with a 
&gt; story line that supports your alliance. We need to figure out 
&gt; viable fixes to the problems of Lvl and Loot. 

&gt; Its up to us.
