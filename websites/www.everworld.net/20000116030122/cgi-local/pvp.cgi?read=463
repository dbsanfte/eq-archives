<P>Please note that i am NOT a pvp person... but I do respect the wants and wishes of others, and want everyone to enjoy the game. I think that the majority of the posts here are in regards to balance between levels (of which there is very very little). Sure, some of these posts distress me, like having zones that are free for alls, which happen to be between cities that one would have to travel to. I dont know about you guys, but I think the monsters in this game are hectic enough without me having to run from well trained PKs as well.

<P>I would really like to see some balancing for pvp types, perhaps a whole differnt combat system for them if they press that pvp switch on. I just cant seem to understand how 2 level differences would make someone so completely dominant above the other, despite the fact that one guy may be better than another.
<P>Pvp has not really been looked at too deeply in EQ yet, and time is running out. I can see why those who love this kind of playing in a roleplaying game are scrambling to get things going before its too late... why should they bother buying the game if its not going to be fun for them? Im not discouraging them for trying, because I will eventually get placed in a war situation and hope that the game handles it well when the time comes, Im just saying, they have a vested interest in this as much as you do, although maybe for different reasons... many of which have nothing to do with the PK kewl d00d attitude that we saw rampant in other games.
<P>PVP people, good luck.
