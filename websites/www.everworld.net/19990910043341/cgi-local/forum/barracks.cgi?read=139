<P>(OOC: The House d'Orbdrin is a unique one amongst the Teir'dal, as can be seen from the excerpt below. We will accept all professions of Teir'dal, as well as Necromancers and Shadow Knights of all races that can have such. Rogues from many races shall be accepted as well. Read below to discover the most important of our views. All Glory to the Teir'dal!)

<P>Darkness lies thick on the Foreign Quarter, dimly lit by eerie illusions that only hint at the wonder and peril of the deeper regions. A populace unlike any on the face of Norrath in habits this place, one found only in this ancient cavern, a place of those things most consider best left hidden. Trolls and ogres walk beside roguish humans, and halflings who in the eerie light look like some strange, stunted demons. Through this varied and largely depraved collection of those unwanted by their own races walk the masters of the place, the Teir'dal, children of Innoruuk.
<P>Looking over the largely human sector of the quarter rises a balcony, a commanding place from which to speak, and a shadowy figure comes to put the place to it's proper use. The figure wears a tattered black robe, unadorned with any sign of vanity, the cowl pulled low to hide its features. The figure seems almost a part of the shadows, its presence only revealed when it deigns to move. Dark-gloved hands reach out to grasp the balcony's edge, and the figure begins to speak with low, sonorous tones.
<P>"Children of Innoruuk, and visitors to this, the greatest city in all of Norrath, hear me, and heed my words. Most among the Teir'dal and outside them see our race as nothing more than hate-mongers, evil beings too twisted and ignorant to see beyond the doctrine spoon-fed to them by the priests of Innoruuk. Do not mistake what I say, I do not claim that we should not respect and honor Innoruuk, for he is the Father of our race. But one can give respect and pay honor to one's Father without believing in his edicts or conforming to his rules. I say we must throw down this doctrine of hate, for it cripples our race and keeps us from ascending to our proper place as masters of Norrath."
<P>The words of heresy echoed strangely through the area, the tones low but carrying, as if the voice had melded with the very air, and spoke from around all corners. All in the quarter stood rapt in attention, shocked that one would utter words such as these at the very doorstep of Innoruuk's power. Guards rushed towards the stars to the balcony, and found them blocked by a small group of rotting corpses, who swiftly engaged them. A priest of Innoruuk rushed towards the conflict as the voice droned on.
<P>"We were made from hate, but we have grown beyond it. Nothing can be made wholly from an emotion that breeds only destruction, as any with eyes and ears about to the truth knows. Hate made us, but it did not make us from nothing, it made us from beings of power and passion, love and honor, of strengths and weaknesses. The power of Innoruuk purged the weakness from the progenitors of our race, and replaced it with another weakness. We must now complete the work so begun, purge our final weakness, this dependency on hate, and fill the void so left by expanding the true strengths of our race. Deception, cunning, intelligence and mystical mastery, these are the true strengths of our race, those strengths that will assure us of victory. Join us now, honor Innoruuk as our Father, but admit that we have outgrown him, that we are more than what he made us, better than what he made us. Let us put things in their proper place, put the Destiny of the Teir'dal ahead of blind adherence to an obselete faith! Join those who see the truth, and we shall realize the full potential of our race!"
<P>The remnants of the rotting corpses lay across the cavern floor among the bodies of slain guardsmen as the priest of Innorukk raced up the stairs. The ominous figure on the balcony cut off his speech and spund around as the priest came upon him, mouth set in a rictus of hate, eyes robbed of intelligence as he gave in to the dark emotion. "Blasphemer!" He screamed, spittle flying from his lips, "I shall send you to your death, where Innoruuk will put tortures upon you to make you scream for the mercy that will never come!"
<P>A low chuckle emanated from the dark figure's hood as the priest ranted, growing swiftly to a disturbing cackle that echoed throughout the cavern. "You will not stop me blind priest, do you think I am foolish enough to endanger myself in so public a place? Come then, strike me, let the 'power' of your hate fill you!"
<P>The priest, all sense robbed from him in his hate, failed to notice the green glow from the figure's eyes as he charged to slay him. As the priest's mace smashed into the figure's arm there was the crack of dry bone, and fragments of ancient yellowed bone fell from the tattered sleeve. The skeleton's other arm flew around to grasp the priest neck, the talon-like fingers sinking into the priest's nexk as the skeleton threw them both over the edge of the balcony in a powerful leap. Their short flight through the air ended with a shattering crack as the skeleton broke upon the stony ground. The priest lay there, a look of surprise on his face at the fragment of bone like a dagger through his heart. The expression of mindless hate never fully left his face, his swiftly glazing eyes fixed on the sigil of the black robe. A strange sign he had not seen before, that of a mask, a mask embroidered with the figure of a silver spider.
