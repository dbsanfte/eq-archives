</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>Ok first off there are MOBs out there that take GROUPS of level 50 people to kill. still though the most fun in ANY game is PVP, a computer will never be as hard as an actual player, 989 tried to make this not so but it just won't work. in that mind i believe eventually people will relize how fun duels are, and move to ACTUAL pvp. in fact in the final they will probly have every server pvp. cuz...there is a little KewL_d00Dz in all of us.

<P>&gt; I think that in a "perfect" PvP world you would be
<BR>&gt; right about the trend to most servers -or more to the point most
<BR>&gt; players- going +PVP. There is a level of challenge that other
<BR>&gt; players can offer you that NPC's can't in terms of creativity
<BR>&gt; and intelligence. Time will have to tell though because it won't
<BR>&gt; happen unless the community of players does so in a way that
<BR>&gt; everyone will be able to enjoy playing in that sort of
<BR>&gt; environment. IMHO UO failed to do that in a big way, in that the
<BR>&gt; PvP there forced everyone to play in a specific limiting fashion
<BR>&gt; if they wanted to be a part of it's so called
<BR>&gt; "community". Variety, challenge, and the ability of
<BR>&gt; anyone to immerse themselves into whatever role they wish in
<BR>&gt; this "fantasy world" is what will dictate the
<BR>&gt; direction the game takes in the long term. If that can be done
<BR>&gt; within a PvP environment... then yes the added depth of PvP will
<BR>&gt; probably attract the majority of players sooner or later.
<P>&gt; Couple of points on some of your comments based off the beta,
<BR>&gt; the info that's been around for a while, and a few years of
<BR>&gt; playing online RPG's.
<BR>&gt; True... that's probably true of PvP in the long term as well
<BR>&gt; though if you think about it. Sure other humans are smarter but
<BR>&gt; so are other software developers and after a year or two other
<BR>&gt; things will come along to attract your attention. (Quite
<BR>&gt; possibly from Verant Interactive or whatever they're called by
<BR>&gt; then )
<BR>&gt; Not true... PvP adds some unique challenges... but so can a well
<BR>&gt; crafted environment. I've played games where NO ONE can handle
<BR>&gt; all of the NPC crits... One area of flexibility the game
<BR>&gt; designers have is in creating certain crits that no one player
<BR>&gt; could ever solo... or even kill in a big party without a great
<BR>&gt; deal of effort. For example it's been said already that it might
<BR>&gt; take several parties of 50th Lvl players to kill a dragon in EQ.
<BR>&gt; I've played in a few PvE only environments where players have
<BR>&gt; been at it for years... and are virtual gods to others... but
<BR>&gt; with good developers they still get presented with some
<BR>&gt; challenges that are a real accomplishment when they manage to
<BR>&gt; complete them.
<BR>&gt; Perhaps you're thinking of another software company's product.
<BR>&gt; EQ clearly has been designed to allow things to be added/changed
<BR>&gt; as time goes on. Any server based game has that capability.
<BR>&gt; They're already talking about additional continents going in,
<BR>&gt; and the whole concept of planes of existence adds limitless
<BR>&gt; possibilities.
<BR>&gt; Agreed... but again even other players are still just different
<BR>&gt; creatures and not immune to boring you
<BR>&gt; I would agree they'll certainly be more competitive:
<BR>&gt;
<BR>&gt; but I'm not sure I understand how complexity comes into it. PvP
<BR>&gt; would allow for much more inspired player interaction however
<BR>&gt; and storylines with the potential to be more compelling than
<BR>&gt; something an NPC throws at ya if done properly.
<BR>&gt; Cool, I know I'll be there if nothing else to see how it shakes
<BR>&gt; out. This is a beta and I'm sure that's probably the EQ-dev's
<BR>&gt; team goal for creating one. It'll expose flaws in the PvP system
<BR>&gt; and maybe give them some ideas on how to make PvP more rewarding
<BR>&gt; for everyone so that it is a viable and exciting part of
<BR>&gt; EVERYONE's gaming experience.
<BR>&gt; This is the mentality that worries me... a game like EQ isn't a
<BR>&gt; "competition" it's an RPG. If I was to "switch
<BR>&gt; over to the PvP server" and be level 1 when you or most
<BR>&gt; other players were level 50 I'd probably be quite glad because I
<BR>&gt; wouldn't have to be competing with ya for rats when I'm trying
<BR>&gt; to get my first few levels . The other thing is... please note
<BR>&gt; the +/- 4 level limitation. This means that I'll be able to
<BR>&gt; advance in the game at my own pace and be able to take on other
<BR>&gt; players who are at least remotely within reach of my abilities
<BR>&gt; as I do so.
<P>&gt; I think EQ is pretty well planned out in this respect... but the
<BR>&gt; proof will be on the PvP server after the 10th :) Maybe it'll
<BR>&gt; work out as well as we all hope and we'll all be +PvP on all the
<BR>&gt; servers... or maybe it'll turn out to be something that appeals
<BR>&gt; to just a segment of their player base. In that case I guess
<BR>&gt; we'll just have to hope that player base remains large enough to
<BR>&gt; warrant a server dedicated to the way they play.
