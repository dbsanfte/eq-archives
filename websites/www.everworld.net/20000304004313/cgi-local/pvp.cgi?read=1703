<P>I just bought Everquest today, but i am no newbie to the game.

<BR>I was in phase 3 and 4, so I know my stuff.
<BR>Reason why I didn't buy the game yet, becuase 1) servers were crap (though from my beta experince I knew Verant would fix the problem)
<BR>2) I couldn't get to the store to buy the game
<P>Anyway, I just play 1 hour and 30 minutes, made it to lvl 3 with one bubble filled (4 to go to lvl 4:), I did say before that their should be factions for killing your own race, and opposing races, I kinda changed my mind. At lvl i was attack by a paladin, who also was lvl 1, I ran to guards, I had low health. The next time I saw the paly again i was lvl 2, the paly was still only lvl 1. I was figthing a snake, and the paly comes up to my kill and tries to steal. I killed the snake, and proceded to kill the paly. i told him not to steal my kill. I saw the paly three more times, he was always lvl 1, i was around lvl 3, and i killed him those 3 times i saw him.
<P>Summary: Don't have factions, if people are pricks, and their your own race, you should be able to defend yourself, without fearing people attack of your NPC race.
<P>P.S. i became blood thirsty, after the first time i killed the paly, i wanted to kill everyone, though i didn't. now that i think about it, i should of.
<P>IMHO, the PVP server is the best, i was against PVP, becuase people from UO put a bad name on it, i can see they were the ones who lost the fights:)
