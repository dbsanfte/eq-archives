<P>I am not dead believe it or not. I have taken a break from the web side of EQ. I was working on a redesign that had a good start but I have yet to make it what I want it. (I'm a bit too much of a perfectionist) Regardless, I needed to break away from the web world etc. I am alive and well and playing a somewhat notorious player on the PvP server. When I quit being the "PVP" GM of EQ it wasn't just because it kept me from doing things I wanted to do. It was because of internal politics and Verant's lack of consideration towards PVP. Although Verant hasn't given enough attention to the PvP shard I believe its doing well because of the people. It still does need alot of attention and I'm glad to see people still motivated to fix things. Because of my trying situation as GM, I even fell away from the RP tree. I'm a bit more PvP than I used to be, but its keeping me into EQ. I'll make you all a deal. I'll send someone an Everquest baseball cap if they can figure out who my character is. Don't Cheat (I'll find out) and I'll only do it for the first person to guess. Feel free to ask questions here, I'll answer the ones I think won't give me away too much. Send your guess too geiger@everworld.net.

<P>I hope I'll be able to actually finish the redesign soon and then move on to the PvP only page.
<P>Until then
