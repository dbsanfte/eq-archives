<P><I>First off, powergamers don't care about factions. If the Covetous Crew and the League of Pirates for example want to fight one another, they will use whatever race/class characters they have available to them to do so. They wont meet up in the forest and divvy up their troops along Verant's system of good vs evil race. </I>

<P>&gt; We, in fact, DO like to kill CC and would find it VERY annoying
<BR>&gt; if they chose to be Dark Elves (as that is what we *DB* have
<BR>&gt; chosen to be). I have given this thought as CC has been our foes
<BR>&gt; since UO beta and we like it that way. BUT, in recognition of
<BR>&gt; the GOOD a faction system would do to the game, we would be
<BR>&gt; willing to search out new foes among the Humans ect if CC and
<BR>&gt; other foes of DB chose to be Dark Elves. The problem here, of
<BR>&gt; course, is that CC in their desire to win will undoubtedly see
<BR>&gt; our weakness and specifically create Dark Elf Clerics to HEAL
<BR>&gt; their Human characters against us which will make our loyalty to
<BR>&gt; Dark Elven Society shaky at best (this is an example CCer's so
<BR>&gt; don't get yer' panties in a bunch *grin*). Yes indeed, I see
<BR>&gt; this as a possible problem, SO I came up with a solution of
<BR>&gt; sorts :) :
<P>I strongly suspect that if both the CC and LoP ended up being dark elves, they would likely forget any past differences and quickly ally against common foes. The game structure has to exist somewhere. No matter what kind of system is put in place, some certain style of play will be impacted.
<P>As for the example given above (dark elf clerics healing human warriors), the faction system should prevent that. A dark elf who helps a human should receive a faction hit. Not a big one, but a hit nonetheless. I recall hearing that if a "evil" and a "good" player were to group, they would both take faction hits. This is merely an extension of that same thing.
<P>&gt; What if the guilds were allowed to declare war on other guilds
<BR>&gt; and any such fighting between them would eliminate any faction
<BR>&gt; penalties? Additionally, any NON-guild member casting a
<BR>&gt; beneficial spell on a guild member will temporily be flagged as
<BR>&gt; allied with said guild and be subject to attack by it's foes!
<BR>&gt; (Voila! Genious! *smile*)
<P>I also seem to recall some mention of a special "guild war" flag that would invalidate the staus of the PvP toggle. This was used as an argument to support nonPvP. I'm guessing that it wouldn't be overly difficult to extend this to the faction system, which is essentially what you've suggested. But then again, who knows what horror lurks in the faction system source code? Not I, that's for sure.
<P><I>Second issue, certain race-class combo's may be lost to groups/guilds under a faction system. If I am a human, then I cannot operate with Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves, SKs, or Necromancers. This restricts my abilities as a PvP guild or group. The reverse is even more true for those playing the dark races, as they may have a much more difficult time forming well balanced PvP teams with only the darkies to choose from. Where will the dark races get their Druids and Monks from, for example?</I>
<P>&gt; To be honest I had not given this much thought, BUT I did just
<BR>&gt; now after reading your post. My response: The restriction on
<BR>&gt; operating as a guild with folks having different classes ect is
<BR>&gt; a minimal cost for the good a faction system will do to add
<BR>&gt; playability and stability to the pvp game. Additionally, guilds
<BR>&gt; can concentrate on a specific race or alignment as we have done
<BR>&gt; and as I am certain the other organized groups will do too. The
<BR>&gt; guild does not HAVE to be class specific, but it seems to me to
<BR>&gt; be a closer guild if their primary guild related activities
<BR>&gt; centered around one home city and race.
<P>I agree. Living within the limits of a race's class limitations makes perfect sense from both a roleplaying perspective and from a powergaming perspective.
<P>As a roleplayer, I would naturally tend to group with players who are my race. I've never been a fan of the "web page guild". In my opinion, when you form a guild it should be made up of players who you meet in the game, who play at compatible times and have similar interests and play styles. It shouldn't be a bunch of people who were all impressed by some webmaster's mastery of HTML and then spend half of their time waiting for each other to "catch up" or run across the whole world because they got killed and res'ed in some far off hamlet. If CC has agreed that they will all create dark elf characters, then I salute them. It is not often that people will forego their individual tastes and interests for the good of a group. In any case, any role-playing guild in-game will obviously be limited to one race, or (at the very least) compatible races.
<P>As a powergamer, I want to see diversity. If both sides on the battle field have the exact same weapons, it makes for a boring battle. It comes down to numbers, and little else. But if one side has (for example) Monks and Druids, and the other side has (hypothetically speaking) ShadowKnights, then things get interesting in a hurry. The "good" guys lack characters with one-hit kill Harm Touch. That's bad for them. But the "evil" guys lack characters with Flying Kick, the ability to look like a tree, and whatever else Monks and Druids can do. Neither side has a clear advantage, but both sides have strengths and weaknesses. Tactics become important.
<P>I'll give an example. There is a popular online WWII flight sim called WarBirds. In that game there are a lot of different types of aircraft, each with differing abilities. But each "country" can choose from ALL of the planes. So what makes Gold different from Green different from Purple? Nothing. People switch teams on a whim. The only "country loyalty" comes from personal friendships.
<P>Occasionally they run organized events. I particiapted in a bombing raid on the sub pens in Kiel. I was on the American side. As the attacking American team we had access to the US planes ONLY. The German team had access to German airframes only. Suddenly, you have a whole different game. The players on each team have to work within the limits of their equipment. Neither side is "better" or "worse", just -different-. The German planes had a higher ceiling, faster climb rate and bigger guns, but the American planes had speed, maneuverability and a ton of armor. We (the American team) were given strict instructions not to persue anything under a hard-deck of 10K feet. Otherwise they would just lure us down low, climb out fast and kill the buffs while we tried to gain back our alt.
<P>With differing abilites on each side, tactics become very important. Exploit the other guy's weakness and he's meat. Fail to take advantage of your unique strengths and you lose. So the question becomes, do we want a uniformity, or diversity? I vote for diversity.
<P>&gt; As much as I respect your posts and ideas (you are very
<BR>&gt; articulate), I always see you seperate Rplayers from
<BR>&gt; Powergamers. I am both. I want to gain power (so I can kill
<BR>&gt; better monsters and folks), but I also LOVE to roleplay. It IS
<BR>&gt; fun! Would not a faction system ALLOW, if not FORCE (to a
<BR>&gt; certain extent), Powergamers to ROLEPLAY at times? IE when
<BR>&gt; Humans RAID Nektulos all of the Dark Elves will call for
<BR>&gt; aid....would not the Powergamer stop his spawn camping for a few
<BR>&gt; minutes to fight off the Humans?
<P>I think so. A faction system of the like which has been described here would serve to increase each players interest in protecting his "home base" from intruders, and it would give everyone instant allies. Those of similar class/race/inclination would band together not only because the faction system makes intra-race killing unpleasant, but also because it rewards extra-race killing (at least to some extent)! Enemy of my enemy and all that.
