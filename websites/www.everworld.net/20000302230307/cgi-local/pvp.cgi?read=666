<P>> The PvP switch was implemented so jerks couldn't kill people

<BR>&gt; that didn't want to participate in PvP. Your enjoyment is no
<BR>&gt; more important than anyone elses. And oddly enough, some people
<BR>&gt; don't enjoy being jumped by 6 little fools. The system you
<BR>&gt; propose does nothing to stop this. Alignment? People will be
<BR>&gt; killing everyone they see just so they can say they are the most
<BR>&gt; evil. And so what if they become outcasts in every city, they're
<BR>&gt; sure to have multiple characters to buy things for them.
<P>&gt; If they could balance the levels so that killing someone 1 level
<BR>&gt; above you wasn't damn near impossible, the current system will
<BR>&gt; be great.
<P>&gt; The only thing wrong with the PvP switch is that it needs to
<BR>&gt; exist.
<P>That is true to some extent, however EverQuest has proven time and time again it is VERY difficult to survive without venturing into cities, at least in lvls 1-24. As polls have shown, there are MUCH more -pvp players than +pvp, so there is no reason to thini kthat with alignment, everyone would suddenly go +pvp... the majority of players would still be -pvp and those wishing to go on a rampage wouodl be rare. If a mass pk came into a zone and started beating up on a human, then other humans would come to the rescue and even guards. This is true because 95% of EQ'ers say they want to Role Play more than PK, well roleplaying would mean helping a fellow player of your race that is in danger. Killing a player 1 level above you is not damn near impossible. A druid can take on a player 2 levels ahead, and i have seen Shamans defeat players 2-4 levels above their own. Again, this system needs work, let me know how you think it should be improved and i will work towards those improvements. Although I doubt any action will be taken in favor of Alignment as it is such a late date in EQ's development, I simply want to make poeple aware of it whether EQ does well or poorly.
