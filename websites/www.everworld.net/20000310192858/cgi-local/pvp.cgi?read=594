<P>> I never said Hobbes wasnt famous in beta I said i never heard of

<BR>&gt; you specifically....
<BR>&gt; and the people i just talked to about you from SiN only 1 person
<BR>&gt; that was in beta even would state that you existed, Inwo Dragon
<BR>&gt; from SoB:
<P>&gt; anyone heard of beta PK named WhiteWolf/Rand?
<BR>&gt; said he ran with Hobbes
<BR>&gt; [11:23] ya, I knew him
<BR>&gt; [11:23] he did
<BR>&gt; [11:24] WAY back in the day
<BR>&gt; [11:24] he did UO vault
<BR>&gt; was he a GOD he says he is :P
<BR>&gt; [11:24] no
<BR>&gt; [11:24] He was good in beta
<BR>&gt; [11:24] not too hot in final
<P>The fact that he says I was good in beta proves my fact. I never said anything about final. I didnt play in final. The fact is we owned beta. When there was 1 server. End of story.
<P>&gt; he said he was the Ultimate UO pVP
<BR>&gt; [11:24] he used like EVERY bug
<BR>&gt; that he was and i quote "a God"
<BR>&gt; [11:25] bah
<P>Second hand false knowledge from someone that is assuming that because I was able to stomp everyone that I used "bugs." I never used any bug nor cheated.
<P>&gt; You fail to read this to its meaning I was talking Final but
<BR>&gt; while youre at it almost 98% or SiN/SoB and DDH all of the GL
<BR>&gt; evil alliance played beta and while some may have heard of you
<BR>&gt; that wont speak up none say you or Hobbes ruled the beta
<BR>&gt; shard...
<P>They are just afraid to admit it.
<P>&gt; again you arnt getting the meaning of what i wrote I was more
<BR>&gt; describing Hobbes not you.....
<BR>&gt; Hobbes is and was famous but again I say what have yall done
<BR>&gt; lately not a damn thing.....
<BR>&gt; Your Uo chars if you even had them anymore would be sorely
<BR>&gt; outdated these days in UO and even newbies would be able to rape
<BR>&gt; you silly :P
<P>Because we dont care to do anything in UO anymore. They have screwed up that game it is not fun to play anymore. And frankly I dont care what people in UO think about me anymore as I dont plan to go back to it ever again.
<P>&gt; well this is a fairly funny statement being that I have been
<BR>&gt; playing EQ since beta 2 and to this date the close of Phase 3.5
<BR>&gt; there is Hardly any PvP + chars anywhere on the damn beta shards
<BR>&gt; I built my char for strictly PvP and there was noone to kill
<BR>&gt; ever....
<BR>&gt; to this point UO is much more Skill based combat and instead of
<BR>&gt; gay ass auto atatck it comes closer to player skill not Char
<BR>&gt; skills.
<BR>&gt; all 200 of our guild was in Beta 1-3.5 EQ and all quit due to
<BR>&gt; extreme boredom and EQs lame combat code... i sold my EQ account
<BR>&gt; after 3 betas for 100k UO gold.
<P>&gt; If beta 4 gets any better and the refine PvP then mayby we will
<BR>&gt; come back but until then forget it EQs weak skill system and no
<BR>&gt; player skill for combat is really dumb Id rather play quake than
<BR>&gt; this and to top it all off Q2 a game over a year older looks
<BR>&gt; better even in SLI 1024x768 looks better than EQ does got man
<BR>&gt; thats kinda bad :P
<P>&gt; that is the main reason I slammed your I am God statement cause
<BR>&gt; i know for a fact that if you were any good you would still be
<BR>&gt; knon if you were even active but the fact you quit casue you
<BR>&gt; could not exploit insta kill bugs tells me youre nothing but a
<BR>&gt; Fraud....
<P>Your own source said he still knew who I was. And this after me not playing for over 6 months. Can you think of anyone else in UO that you can say the same about besides hobbes? Nope! End of story!
<P>&gt; reactivate and put your money where your mouth is Mr.IamGod
<BR>&gt; Im calling you out....
<P>I already told you im not going to set foot in that lame piece of crap game. EQ is far better than UO EVER was.
