<P>> Classes were balance first and foremost for pve untility. None

<BR>&gt; were ever meant to be balanced perfectly one on one vs other
<BR>&gt; players. Changing classes just for pvp concerns isn't feasible
<BR>&gt; for Verants goals in a mostly pve game. There will always be a
<BR>&gt; best class.....period. There is no guarantee that a rogue will
<BR>&gt; ever be able to compete with an Erudite wizard.
<P>Yes, I know how the system works and that its designed versus PVE, I am just pointing out that they might have that additional "increased" melee which is better than that of a pure spellcaster.
<P>&gt; He is a pure spellcaster.
<BR>&gt; Meant to be. They are master of diversity, but not great at any
<BR>&gt; one skill. It's going to be a fact that some classes will be
<BR>&gt; more popular than others for 1 on 1 combat.
<P>&gt; weaker than cleric heal
<BR>dont forget, he still has it.
<P>&gt; weaker than wizard or magician damage
<BR>again noone else has that. weaker yes, but it uses less mana as well.
<BR>&gt; all casters get it
<BR>yep
<P>&gt; only outdoors and useless if your are being attacked(until later
<BR>&gt; levels)
<P>&gt; agreed root spells suck in pvp
<BR>who said they suck, on contrary its essential when your opponent is running away, like they often do. If they are brave and stay in until the end, then its completely useless, unless you want to buy some seconds of distance.
<P>&gt; not all that great, but you forgot to mention damage spells,
<BR>&gt; those can hurt in pvp.
<P>&gt; They can wear leather. I know for a fact any armor worth wearing
<BR>&gt; past leather equivalent is also available to wizards as well.
<P>See, PURE SPELLCASTERS CAN'T WEAR LEATHER. THIS IS WHERE INBALANCE STARTS.
<P>&gt; Weapon skills, they are no better than any cleric or shamans,
<BR>&gt; and exactly the same as any wizard until weapon skill caps come
<BR>&gt; into play at later levels. People have some weird idea that
<BR>&gt; druids are part warrior just because they can use a scimitar,
<BR>&gt; its just some left over rp choice from D&D type games.
<P>&gt; Druids are no more hybrids than a cleric or shaman. If being the
<BR>&gt; best is all that matter then play a druid if you deem it 'best'.
<BR>&gt; I have found many other classes just as powerful in the right
<BR>&gt; circumstances. It's all according to who starts the combat and
<BR>&gt; under what conditions.
<P>&gt; laters, Chris
<BR>I am not saying its best, but it seems to be terribly inbalanced, he gets all benefits of pure spellcaster + leather armor + use of armor + his spells are so diverse to include everythign. I know he doesn't excell in any of them, but this still doesn't mean they should let them wear leather.
<BR>&gt; btw, I agree some classes are more powerful, but I know that pve
<BR>&gt; was always the balance intended, not pvp.
