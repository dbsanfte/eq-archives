<P>Hello, my fellow Veeshan brethen. What I am posting is only a transcript of a message I recently sent to Avatar Sarcoth of the Sacred Haven guild. It is my plea for acceptance into their prestigious group of adventurers, as they do not allow necromancers or those who worship Bertoxxulous. Please read what I have said, and give me your opinion on the matter!

<BR>--------------------------------------------------
<BR>Greetings Avatar Sarcoth, and my regards to Sacred Haven. Your wide array of members is notable, as is your reputation among the adventurers of Norrath. I send my thanks to you for, despite my class and deity being listed as an enemey of your guild, saving me from a horde of vicious skeletons raging across the Stormfont Mountains. I was able to make it to my home city, Ak'Anon, alive, thanks to your guild members' generousity. I am a Gnome necromancer of the 9th Level, known as Kordak to my people. It is true, I do worship Bertoxxulous, and I do believe the prophecies that have been made by my Sacred One. Despite my believe, I have, thus far, refused to show any evil to the races of Norrath, even after taking high abuse among countless guards whose faces I have never even glanced at; whose names I don't even know. You may find this atrocious, but your own guards not only verbally abused me, they relieved themselves of their posts to slay me without a cause. I find this unreasonable, as I have killed many Orcs, your enemy, in the name of justice. I do believe that my class's treatment is duly unfair, and I pray that the day will come when true justice is served on Faydwer and the rest of Norrath.
<P>Would it be so terrible just to tolerate my brethen for only a short while? I can understand where your hatred for Bertoxxulous and necromancers has sprouted from; I know the wrongdoings of my ancestors and the pain they have caused your people. I understand that Gnomes, especially those who follow the Plaguebringer, are known for mistreatment to your people, and even going as far as abushing righteous Elven parties. I come to you, Avatar, to set aside this rivalry and understand that, despite my deity, I too work for the causes of Goodness and Justice. If I were to request entry to your prestigious guild, the Sacred Haven, would you, like so many of your brethen, instantly disqualify me as evil and corrupt? In you I see true light, and I see that you are kind and just among those you are close to. I believe that if you were to just look past our differences and qualms, you would understand that I truly am as noble as a High Elven paladin.
<P>I realize this message is becoming quite lengthy, so if you desire to stop reading, please skip to the last paragraph. If you are not convinced yet, I plea with you to continue reading, and learn about my noble adventures that will uphold my claims.
<P>In order to sway your opinion, I will provide some background of my exploits across Norrath to this point in time. I started out, as many do, killing rats and decaying skeletons for pure survival. Despite my deathly nature, the decaying skeletons show a particular hatred for me, which I believe to be a result of the light which truly resides in my soul. I quickly learned of the kobolds' unjust and brutal treatment of my brethen, the Gnomes, and their devotion to your ancestral enemies, the Orcs. I slaughtered any of the Runts I came across, preventing them from future destruction. After experiencing some breathtaking battles, I made a vow to destroy any Kobold or Orc I came across, a promise which I have attempted to uphold to my best efforts to this day. After slaying countless Runts, I made the decision to siege a nearby Kobold camp, an outpost of their main base in the outskirts of the Steamfont Mountains. I bravely fought each one of them, showing a particular hatred for their elders, the Shaman.
<P>I learned from a Erudite friend that they too have been having problems with the vicious Kobolds, and I decided to aid them against my longtime foes. It was then that I learned the true hatred of my fellow Faydwerian races' unjustifiable hatred for my God and class. In my first ignorant attempt to reach the western dock, I came upon the enchanting city of Kelethin, and was awe-inspired. I was amazed by the City of the Trees, and proceeded to take the elevator up for a closer look. I was so overcome with glee as I exited the elevator I didn't notice the raging guard approacing me from behind. Without even a warning, he mercilessly cut me down, screaming like a madman of the wrongdoings I had supposedly caused him. What lawfulness is behind these actions? I don't believe you, my apologies, or anyone else can truly answer this question.
<P>This recent slaughter hindered me considerably, as I was not able to recover my weapon and money. I was forced to put off my trip to Erudin and lick my wounds for a short time. After cutting down more Kobolds, I decided to again venture across the world to the mystical city of Erudin. I began my trek towards the Butcherblok Mountains, this time with more navigational information on the two Faydarks. I did not expect to meet up with any guards until I reached Kaladim, so I happily trotted down the path towards the docks. How wrong I was. Izabel Brightblade, a fanatic, ripped me from limb to limb as I was walking unknowingly. I was a broken gnome, downspirited and depressed, and convinced that the races of Faydwer had gone insane. I remained in the Steamfont Mountains for a time, believing that I was doomed to hunt in these lands forever.
<P>I brightened up as a noble *Dwarven paladin,* of all classes, decided to help me! Maybe that information will convince you of my true nature. If not, continue reading. He and a Wood Elven friend guided me safely across Faydwer, leading me around aggressive guards and to the docks of Butcherblok. The celebrated ship arrived, and I boarded, excited about future adventures and quests. Another Human paladin was kind enough to guide me through Freeport, and point me towards Rivervale, my next destination. It was on the Commonlands that I realized the awful wrongdoings of my past necromancer ancestors. After carefully avoiding several Hill Giants, I began to see strange and powerful undead, which were likely to slay me if I let my presence be known. It was rumored that these monsters originated from a dungeon known as the Befallen, which I now know is a devasting creating of a possibly Gnomish necromancer. I despise those of my craft who wish to do any wrongdoing toward the peaceful races of Norrath, and I one day hope to rid Befallen of its ancient curse. I was pondering these new feelings when a group of undead surrounded me and slayed me, demolishing one who worships their own God.
<P>After deciding that my struggle to journey to Erudin was impossible, I allied with a Dwarven cleric, known as Zantarium, who worships a God which you strongly approve of. A cleric. What more proof do you need that I am good and righteous? We have killed many Orcs, skeletons, and plauged and diseased rats, and seek to rid Faydwer of these awful inhabitants. I beg of you, Avatar Sarcoth, to set aside our differences and judge me fairly, as I know you can. If it is necessary to call a vote, please present this document to all voting members, so my true story can be heard to all. Zantarium and I may be eager to join your noble guild, and I hope to hear from you very soon!
<BR>--------------------------------------------------
<BR>I realize that message was quite long, but I believe it was worth it. I desire to change the opinion of my class, and only seek acceptance in a world of hate. Please feel free to e-mail me or reply with any comments you have on anything I have said. Trust me, they will be appreciated!
