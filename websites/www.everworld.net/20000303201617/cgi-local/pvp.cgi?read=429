<P>

<P>The first step to take is to introduce at least one zone that allows for PvP without level restrictions. This can become the wasteland zone where large gropus of PvP players can roam at will and vie for dominance. This would be an area where guild rivalries could be settled, and those that controlled the region could be considered the dominant force on the server. I would then add to this idea by having one or more of the city arena's also designated as level free for PvP combats. Add to that a system of controlling who can enter the arena and when (hey it's DSO!) and you gain a great deal of flexibility.
<P>Finally, how to solve the problem of group combat. Well to begin with create a /gduel command that allows one group to duel
<BR>another, regardless of their levels, to support voluntary group battles. For the spontaneous mayhem, I suggest the following:
<P>Calculating Group Attack Range (GAR):
<P>GAR is calculated by taking the highest level character in the group and dividing his level by 10 rounded up, then adding three to that number. This is the number +/- that the group would be able to engage in combat. Given the GAR, a group can attack other groups where 2/3 of the other groups members fall within their GAR. Ex: A 40th level has a GAR of +/-7 or 33 to 47. If the highest member were 30th, then the spread would be 24 to 36 (+/- 30 / 3 + 3).
<BR>For the group to attack, you need a 2/3 majority of the members of the group being attacked to fall within the GAR. Further, any
<BR>characters below 1/2 the level of the highest character in the group are not considered in the GAR calculation. Once combat begins, neither group can add players to their group. Players in both groups have an internal group PvP flag set. A list of all players hostile to the group is also maintained internally. Any players dropping from the group remain in combat mode with the other players (flag remains set). A timeout period wherein no combat ensues will reset a player's group PvP flag. Only when the group PvP flag is reset can a player join a new group. There is no restriction placed on additional groups or individuals involving themselves in the fighting as long as they meet the individual or group level restrictions for the player(s) they are attacking. Note: If an individual attacks a player within a red group, then that player has their group PvP flag set and can then be attacked by anyone within that group.
<P>&gt; Kellindel's post lead right into my next (Sub)topic:
<P>&gt; If the scenario was: A PvP party of lvl 32, 33, 33, 34, 35,
<P>&gt; & 35 comes upon a PvP party of lvl 23, 24, 26, 27, 27, 31.
<P>&gt; The way it looks is the lvl 31 is screwed. What can we do here?
<P>In my system group A can fight a range of 29 to 42 based on the 35th level max char (35 +/- (35 / 10 + 3). Group B is clearly
<BR>underpowered as only one of their players is within range of group A, so A cannot attack group B.
<P>Group B on the other hand can fight 25 to 37 levels. All players in group A are within this range, so group B *could* attack group A if they so desired, thus initiating the combat.
<P>Now assume a group C consists of lvl 24, 27, 28, 30, and 31. Group C can be attacked by group A as 3/4 of group C's members
<BR>meet the GAR requirement of group A. Likewise group C has a GAR of 25 to 37 and can initiate an attack on group A as well.
<P>Here's another example group D. D consists of lvl 1, 3, 25, 27, 28. Group D is clearly trying to protect itself from attacks by
<BR>including a couple of gimp characters, or the high levels are twinking for the 1 & 3 characters. (Un)fortunately the GAR calculation excludes characters below level 11 (highest char 22 / 2) in deciding what range can attack D. Group D's GAR is 22 to 34. Either group B or group C mentioned earlier could attack group D, but group A could not. There is no benefit to the group that includes very low level characters. Ideally grouping would not be allowed unless all char's met the GAR requirement of the highest level character.
<P>Finally here is the newbie group E, lvl 5, 6, 7, 8, and 8. Group E has a GAR of 5 to 11. So E could attack a party of all 5's, all 11's, or anything in between. The strongest group that could attack them would contain a level 10, which would have a GAR of 6 through 14. Take group F, levels 9, 9, and 10. GAR of 6 to 14. Group F can attack E as 2/3 of group E fall within group F's GAR.
<P>This system gives flexibility in allowing a weaker group to attack much stronger groups, but does not allow stronger groups to
<BR>bottom feed to far among weaker groups.
<P>Individual vs Group:
<P>If an individual attacks a group and the member he attacked is below the lower limit of the GAR range and the attacker is also below the GAR range and otherwise meets the level limit requirement (+/-4), thenthe attack is an individual attack and the player he attacked is ejected from the group. Members of his former group can no longer cast spells on him or otherwise interfere. If however the attacked player is within his GAR then the attack by the individual constitutes an attack on the entire group and as such the group can respond.
<BR>EX: Group F has lvl 5, 16, 17, and 20. The GAR is 15 to 25, which the level 5 clearly does not meet. Anyone level 9 or below can attack the level 5 and it is considered an individual attack. Players level 10 through 14 who attempt to attack the lvl 5 are unable to attack, and players 15th through 25th attacking the lvl 5 initiate an attack on the group *AND* can also attack the lvl 5.
<BR>Optionally anyone level 10 or above who attacks the lvl 5 initiates an attack on group F for simplicity.
<BR>This prevents high level groups from sheltering low level players and discourages twinking.
<P>Optional Method:
<P>Players that don't meet the GAR requirements cannot join a group. So a level 5 cannot join a group of 15 to 20s. When a new high member attempts to join he can only do so if all players currently grouped are valid for his GAR.
<BR>EX: Group G has 12, 14, and 15. The GAR is 11 to 19. Players below 11 cannot join. If a 16 wished to join he could because the 16 has a GAR of 12 to 20 which all current members of G have. A 17 however could not join group G unless the 12 dropped.
<P>The latter method is much simpler to understand and implement, but does restrict grouping features, abeit not unreasonably.
<P>An additional rule allowing a lower level groups or individuals to have an unlimited upper attack range could be introduced, but that in itself is a seperate issue for discussion and poses it's own problems (lvl 3 player kills a L/D level 30+ and loots an 80pp item)...
