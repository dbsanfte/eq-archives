<P>Hrmm...

<BR>I find this post kind of funny Geiger and really didn't expect it to come from you. The looting because of death to an NPC as I have been told by many people, including GM's, is a bug that is on low priority and will be fixed. Now, you being a GM, I think that maybe if you didn't like this bug around, then you would try and push to have it fixed. Secondly, isn't it very bad business to say "I call for a death to him until he goes and takes his poison to Fennin Ro or just quits EQ all together." Now, do you realize how many times people have been looted in this game due to this bug and nothing is or has ever been done about it? I myself have lost some very rare magical items due to this bug because some newbie runs up and loots my body when I die and there is nothing I can do because they are out of my level range, yet you do not see me calling for them to be killed repeatidly until they quit or go to another server. Above all else, you are a GM and this type of thing is shunned in my book and I feel it is shunned within many others. If I were you I would give a public appology and not make a post like this again, being that you are someone who works for Verant and I'm sure that they would not be happy to see a post like this.
