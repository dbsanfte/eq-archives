<P>This past weekend my companions and I were exploring Lavastorm looking for the entrance to Solusek. We got some information on where it was supposed to be so we went to investigate. We took the precautions we thought would be safest by going invis then zoning into the area. As soon as we appeared on the other side we were hit with a huge barrage of attacks from 2 Greater Shaman and their pets. My two companions fell to the charm spell of the shaman and one of them slew me. Mind you this all happened within a matter of seconds so there was no hope for escape... not for me anyway.

<P>We all met again after my companions regained their senses from the spell and tried to figure out how to get to my corpse. We settled on calling on the assistance of some level 25 friends of ours in order to help but it turned out they would be unable to assist for a few hours.
<P>After thinking about the events that led to my death I figured my corpse must be near the zone line and I should be able to zone in and drag it to me so I could loot it. I went back to the area and zoned through. I saw my corpse, but was immediately charmed by the shaman who held me for over 3 minutes walking in circles. I finally broke free and was able to zone before they killed me again, but I wasn't able to loot my corpse. The corpse was by the zone, but the shaman were so close that as soon as you zoned in they would attack.
<P>I wasn't sure if my problem qualified as one that a GM would assist me on, but I decided to take a chance so I /petitioned it. I had already resigned myself to a long wait for a response, but to my surprise about 10 minutes later I got a /tell from GM/Guide Rocyan asking if she could help me. Needless to say I was amazed. She met us at the spot and went inside to investigate. She ended up killing the shaman and their pets then called me to get my corpse. I had to laugh when I asked her if she saw the shaman her answer was 'Shaman? What shaman?'... It must be nice to be a god. *giggles*
<P>Anyway as soon as I zoned in I noticed for the first time the actual name of the zone we had been in. It wasn't Solusek it was Nagafen's Lair! I near soiled myself when I read that. Rocyan suggested I make haste in leaving, but I had already figured that one out and having looted my corpse I was making a run for the zone. There are some places you just know you're not supposed to be in... Rocyan explained that the shaman shouldn't have been placed that close to the zone line and that she was glad to have been able to help me.
<P>I must say that I owe GM/Guide Rocyan a huge amount of thanks for answering my /petition so quickly and for helping me to retrieve my belongings. I'm sure most of us will have different experiences with EQ ingame assistance, and I have heard some horror stories concerning things that have supposedly happened, but I am very happy to say that my experience with Verant's ingame support was nothing short of outstanding! So if you see Rocyan around ingame, please treat her with respect and consideration and you will get the same and more in return.
<P>Oh and we did find Solusek's Eye, but that is another story... *winks*
<P>Thank you again Lady Rocyan!!
