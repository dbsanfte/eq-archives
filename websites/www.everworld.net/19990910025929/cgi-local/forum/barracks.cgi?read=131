<P><b>There was a great tidal wave in the ocean</b> of all magic at the time the ancient wyrm, Veeshan, created the world now known as Norrath, a world of power and knowledge undreamt of before it's time.
<P>All beings that have their roots in the soil of magic were greatly effected at the time of Veeshan's creation... The Lost Order of Akalabeth included.
<P>The Lost Order of Akalabeth is an ancient guild, devoted to each other, and the bonds of friends and family. The symbols of their devotion to each other, and their holy relics are the Shard and the Tome. Artifacts older than time that have been in the Lost Order's care taking longer than the oldest wyrms memory. The Order has existed on many planes of reality, always prospering, always growing. The time came that they found themselves in the world known as Britannia, a world of great magic, and greater evils. Against all odds, the guild achieved the greatest height of their prosperity thus far. However, as strong as the order had grown, Britannia seemed to fall apart around them. At first, they prayed and fought for the rehabilitation of the world, but soon a growing number of them began to seek another way... a way out. They gathered and worked their magics, casting and scrying for a solution.
<P>Then one clear night, their prayers were answered. A new world had been discovered, through the lens of the great Moonglow telescope they could see it... and it was coming to them. Time was short, and they had to work fast. A group of volunteers had been selected to find a way. Their quest was perhaps the most difficult in the known history of the guild, but they were determined to spread the word of the shard and tome to this new world.
<P>Night and day they had worked, and all the preparations were set. As the Eleventh hour approached, they were ready. Nothing could go wrong. Or so they believed.
<P>Some say 'timing is everything', and in this case, the Lost Order's timing could not have been worse. There is really no way they could have known, but Norrath at that time was a dead world of raw magic and untamed power. It was a modified gate spell that they had selected to bring them to this new world, and as the group of them stepped through, they were viciously ripped from their mortal coils, at what they thought the perfect time to make a jump between worlds, at the height of Britannia's and Norrath's passing, when the magic was at it's most potent, it was also at it's most deadly. Their souls were literally ripped from their mortal coils and meshed with the pure magic that was Norrath. Not a scream, just a flash of light, the passing of two planets in the night, and a guild was torn apart to it's core.
<P>Eons later, when Veeshan created the life and power on the then dead world known as Norrath, the souls of the lost guild members were still intact, buried in the magic that was Norrath, unaware that they would have their time again. The world of Norrath flourished with life and magics, and new intelligent creatures. Ages later, when the world was ripe for bold new ideas, and fresh blood to take it into another era of greatness, the souls of the Lost Order of Akalabeth seemed to know instinctively, and rose again in the Mortal shells of the beings of that world.
<P>They were once again The Lost Order of Akalabeth, Brothers and Sisters, living for each other, and under the guidance of the Shard and Tome. There was a difference this time though, as they did not have the Shard and Tome to protect, and to guide them. The guild was divided on what the Shard and Tome had represented. Some believed The Shard was a ray of light and guidance, and the Tome was a Lexicon of Knowledge to be used for the greater good of all. Then there were others who believed the Shard was broken, that it had been cast away from the whole, being imperfect, and it stood for rejection and vengeance. They also believed The Tome was a book of unbridled power, to be used to force the guild to greater and greater heights, on the backs of the weak.
<P>Hence, there became a division in The Lost Order of Akalabeth on Norrath. The Light Order and the Dark Sect. The one precept they maintained was that no matter the difference in their beliefs, they would always uphold their devotion to each other, and they would search for the lost Shard and Tome together. Once they found it, they would see who had been in the right.
<P><i>And this finishes the tale of how The Lost Order of Akalabeth came to reside in Norrath, and where we stand today. We continue our search for our lost artifacts, and our guild prospers as always. There are tensions, but we maintain the respect and commitment to each other. And we just seem to achieve our means a bit differently.</i>
