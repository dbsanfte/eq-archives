</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> I'm not going to call you "stupid" or

<BR>&gt; "idiotic" because you obviously are not. Your post was
<BR>&gt; well written, but I'm afraid, completely off the mark and
<BR>&gt; UNBELIEVABLY short sighted. May I ask you this? WHY do you think
<BR>&gt; Sony had such a hard time deciding if there would even BE a PvP
<BR>&gt; server? I can answer that for you if you're a bit confused. The
<BR>&gt; answer is this: Because of people who THINK like you do!
<P>And how do I think? All I ask is more freedom and let people roleplay as spontantenous murderers... there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, and think of it as roleplaying. What I too find bad is people who start swearing/spamming/annoying people non stop, thats is not really roleplaying, but hey..thats why PVP is so great.. you can get rid of them easily :)
<P>&gt; Let me preface my comments with this. I WILL play on the PvP
<BR>&gt; server simply because I still feel the pros outweigh the cons,
<BR>&gt; but I must admit, it's getting tougher and tougher to make that
<BR>&gt; statement because of people like you and your
<BR>&gt; "friends" running around.
<P>Yes, Pros of being able to attack anyone you wish. THAT IS ONLY DIFFERENCE. so that you like more than on normal server, but you hate how a pk should roleplay? I am going to roleplay thats not the problem, but I am saying that its pointless to waste 1 minute writing some story the guy won't even read because he will be attacking you as soon as he sees that you will attack him..or he will run..
<P>&gt; My friend, there are OTHER games out there for people with your
<BR>&gt; thoughts to play! Now listen, I completely understand that there
<BR>&gt; are MANY schools of thought out there, but we all have to keep
<BR>&gt; ONE important thing in mind! This is a ROLE PLAYING GAME! It
<BR>&gt; means, PLAY A ROLE! If that's not what you want to do, please
<BR>&gt; find a game that is more condusive to your playing style! I want
<BR>&gt; to play a game, a ROLE playing game, where it is as REALISTIC as
<BR>&gt; it possibly can! Thus, I play on the PvP server for the REALISM
<BR>&gt; that comes from NEVER knowing where your next attacker is going
<BR>&gt; to come from!
<P>Yep, agree with you there all the way. Now how would you like me to go "Hey Pariah, I ,in name of Rallos, will kill you now to avenge his death!"... this kills that SUPRISE attack you SO much love.. ( I love it too)..
<BR>Other games ...what other games? UO? Same concern.. GM's imposing their views of how people should act..
<P>yes it is roleplaying game, and THERE IS NO TRUE definition for roleplaying, that means I can roleplay a NPC merchant and stand still WHOLE DAY if i wish...or I can role play as a mute mad gnomish wizard that has gone beserk..! Why would this be "bad" like you say it is? NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.
<P>Will it be from that nasty gnoll just around the
<BR>&gt; corner in BB? Or is it when I get off the patroled paths in the
<BR>&gt; darker corners of Qeynos? I LOVE THIS! But I'm afraid it will
<BR>&gt; one day be taken away from me by people who are concerned about
<BR>&gt; one thing: Their OWN enjoyment at the complete and utter cost of
<BR>&gt; all others!
<P>utter cost of others? sigh, people I fight are stronger than me, and usually travel in groups of 3+ and hang near guards... I am sure they got last laughs 90% of time because of such stupid guard bugs... I wasn't mad, I had fun fighing. ITS A GAME PARIAH, ITS NOT REAL! I have fun and people I fought had fun, so nothign wrong with that...and talk about killing their own enjoyment , hell with that thats so off..
<P>&gt; Listen, I'm not some wierdo who cofuses his games with reality,
<BR>&gt; but I do like to bring some reality into the games I play. I try
<BR>&gt; and play them REALISTICALLY! Nine times out of ten (and I admit,
<BR>&gt; I sometimes fail at this) before I commit a "hostile"
<BR>&gt; action, I ask myself, "If this were reality, considering
<BR>&gt; the circumstances and the situation, would I do this?" And
<BR>&gt; you know what? It helps me play my ROLE!
<P>Well, I do like challenge in games, I like feeling risk . I like being hunted down and opposed. I like to roleplay as a strong mystic spellcaster thats an outcast of society (Thats why I kill because society (like you) rejects me. Also because of my god Broxxolus (mispelled it... should check ..) so there is nothign wrong I can roleplay like that and I fidn it fun, and hey GAME IS ROLEPLAYING, YOU SAID IT... now are you saying ROLEPLAYING COMES OVER FUN? Because you said I kill other peoples enjoyment over my OWN selfish interests of fun... Hell ok so then thats more important (to make sure everyone is enjoying the game)... than to roleplay? If any is the case, I will take my time explain where you are wrong.
<P>I am going to roleplay, dont take me wrong, All I am fighing for is that people should be given freedom of speech and actions! I dont want to see people complaining "he didn't kill me in a roleplaying fashion".. doing that in most times makes you lose an element of suprise, and if you know about war, being able to do the first strike is of a big advantage... and why dont you just then make sure that once someone attacks there is 1 minute delay before fight can begin? perhaps this will eliminate that..call in another switch... call in another limit...just enough so you get enough time for people to talk their reasons..in roleplaying fashion
<P>&gt; Every day I pass this guy (and I'm talking real life now) on a
<BR>&gt; street corner. He is ALWAYS there. And almost every day, I have
<BR>&gt; to walk around him. He get's in my way at LEAST once every 24
<BR>&gt; hours, 5 days a week. YES, I'd like him to move. I would LOVE
<BR>&gt; it! But I've never thought, "Okay, that's it. Tomorrow I'm
<BR>&gt; bringing a friend and a blade and I'll get his ass out of my
<BR>&gt; way." I'm just saying, try not to think like that in a ROLE
<BR>&gt; PLAYING game, either!
<P>Hell, I'd do that! :)
<P>(just joking of course, hope you don't take me serious there).
<P>No, this is a game, and this virtual reality lets us roleplay as someone we wish to be (again, I dont want to be a murderer, I just like having great realism and player vs player challenge..) So AGAIN, as i said, this is about roleplaying whoever we wish to me, wheter its a merchant that stands non stop at one spot, or a speechless gnome that went beserk....
<P>Pariah, I am sure you wont waste time telling me how you will dispatch me and how your god will kill me when I start attacking you...where is your roleplaying there?
<P>&gt; I dug Quake. I dug Duke Nukem. They both have their place, and
<BR>&gt; it's NOT in EverQuest! They were not ROLE playing games. Please
<BR>&gt; look to the future of online RPGs and help us SAVE PvP server on
<BR>&gt; them! Sure, you can't get immediate satisfaction ALL the time.
<BR>&gt; You want that, PLEASE go back to the frag fests. Play EQ in the
<BR>&gt; genre for which it was created, taking into consideration more
<BR>&gt; than just your 30 second gratification, then going in search for
<BR>&gt; another one. Yes, I know, it's addictive and like a drug, but I
<BR>&gt; PROMISE you, if you play a game like EQ in the way it was MEANT
<BR>&gt; to be played, you will find SOOOOO much MORE PERMANENT
<BR>&gt; satisfaction! I PROMISE! I've been in your shoes, my friend!
<BR>&gt; Help this PvP online RPGing genre survive. Don't kill it for a
<BR>&gt; quick fix, or I'm afraid you'll find yourself STARVED for what
<BR>&gt; you helped destroy.
<P>I never played Quake nor Duke Nukem.. I played commander keen lol I hope that relates...
<P>I love RPG, and if you didn't pick up my point yet... it is
<P>People should be given more freedom over their actions, and GM's should not impose iron hand over people's roleplaying, nor should any other players judge someones roleplaying as "good", or valid... Players should be allowed to be who they want to be, and should be allowed to act like the wish (not go about cheating or abusing). Playerkilling is aspect of game which gives it special addition that little RPG games have, and thats why its so fun. My point is that fun is more important than roleplaying, and I am not talking about my fun, I am talking about whole server attitude.

&gt; SO much love.. ( I love it too).. 
&gt; Other games ...what other games? UO? Same concern.. GM's 
&gt; imposing their views of how people should act.. 

&gt; yes it is roleplaying game, and THERE IS NO TRUE definition for 
&gt; roleplaying, that means I can roleplay a NPC merchant and stand 
&gt; still WHOLE DAY if i wish...or I can role play as a mute mad 
&gt; gnomish wizard that has gone beserk..! Why would this be 
&gt; &quot;bad&quot; like you say it is? NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. 

&gt; Will it be from that nasty gnoll just around the 

&gt; utter cost of others? sigh, people I fight are stronger than me, 
&gt; and usually travel in groups of 3+ and hang near guards... I am 
&gt; sure they got last laughs 90% of time because of such stupid 
&gt; guard bugs... I wasn't mad, I had fun fighing. ITS A GAME 
&gt; PARIAH, ITS NOT REAL! I have fun and people I fought had fun, so 
&gt; nothign wrong with that...and talk about killing their own 
&gt; enjoyment , hell with that thats so off.. 

&gt; Well, I do like challenge in games, I like feeling risk . I like 
&gt; being hunted down and opposed. I like to roleplay as a strong 
&gt; mystic spellcaster thats an outcast of society (Thats why I kill 
&gt; because society (like you) rejects me. Also because of my god 
&gt; Broxxolus (mispelled it... should check ..) so there is nothign 
&gt; wrong I can roleplay like that and I fidn it fun, and hey GAME 
&gt; IS ROLEPLAYING, YOU SAID IT... now are you saying ROLEPLAYING 
&gt; COMES OVER FUN? Because you said I kill other peoples enjoyment 
&gt; over my OWN selfish interests of fun... Hell ok so then thats 
&gt; more important (to make sure everyone is enjoying the game)... 
&gt; than to roleplay? If any is the case, I will take my time 
&gt; explain where you are wrong. 

&gt; I am going to roleplay, dont take me wrong, All I am fighing for 
&gt; is that people should be given freedom of speech and actions! I 
&gt; dont want to see people complaining &quot;he didn't kill me in a 
&gt; roleplaying fashion&quot;.. doing that in most times makes you 
&gt; lose an element of suprise, and if you know about war, being 
&gt; able to do the first strike is of a big advantage... and why 
&gt; dont you just then make sure that once someone attacks there is 
&gt; 1 minute delay before fight can begin? perhaps this will 
&gt; eliminate that..call in another switch... call in another 
&gt; limit...just enough so you get enough time for people to talk 
&gt; their reasons..in roleplaying fashion 

&gt; Hell, I'd do that! :) 

&gt; (just joking of course, hope you don't take me serious there). 

&gt; No, this is a game, and this virtual reality lets us roleplay as 
&gt; someone we wish to be (again, I dont want to be a murderer, I 
&gt; just like having great realism and player vs player challenge..) 
&gt; So AGAIN, as i said, this is about roleplaying whoever we wish 
&gt; to me, wheter its a merchant that stands non stop at one spot, 
&gt; or a speechless gnome that went beserk.... 

&gt; Pariah, I am sure you wont waste time telling me how you will 
&gt; dispatch me and how your god will kill me when I start attacking 
&gt; you...where is your roleplaying there? 

&gt; I never played Quake nor Duke Nukem.. I played commander keen 
&gt; lol I hope that relates... 

&gt; I love RPG, and if you didn't pick up my point yet... it is 

&gt; People should be given more freedom over their actions, and GM's 
&gt; should not impose iron hand over people's roleplaying, nor 
&gt; should any other players judge someones roleplaying as 
&gt; &quot;good&quot;, or valid... Players should be allowed to be 
&gt; who they want to be, and should be allowed to act like the wish 
&gt; (not go about cheating or abusing). Playerkilling is aspect of 
&gt; game which gives it special addition that little RPG games have, 
&gt; and thats why its so fun. My point is that fun is more important 
&gt; than roleplaying, and I am not talking about my fun, I am 
&gt; talking about whole server attitude.
