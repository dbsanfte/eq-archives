<P>actually, to be honest, I guess PvP balance depends on who you are. If you are a wizard, root will be your most useful spell, and if you can't get it off, you will die. I actually went back to the inn where I died at in my last message, and found the wizard that had killed me before. Seeing that I had looted my body, she decided she wanted another item off of me, and preceded to run into the forest where she thought i couldnt see her ot try to root me and kill me exactly the same way she did before. LOL.. I still died, but she could not have killed me on her own. I chased her ass all over East commons kicking and punching her every time she turned around to try to root me... evntually she gave up and tried to do fire ball or something, she hit me once with it for about 20 points. The whole fight took about 10 minutes (you have ANY idea how HARD it is to chase down a damn female dark elf in a dark cloak at NIGHT?) and eventually she lost me and rooted me as I ran back to the inn. Even then, she ran out of mana before she took half of my hit points and I preceded to chase her almost all the way to Neriak before I was rooted by someone else and then killed by 4 or 5 dark elf mages and 2 pets. It was very, very fun. However, I dislike the fact that most of the people that play dark elves seem to be around 10-12 and social misfits in real life, judging from their manners online. I really cant wait until I get to level 14 and get dual wield (even though I started another character and I'm at lvl 5 with him, I will go back to my monk eventually). I think the game IS unbalanced, but a smart player will be able to overcome his classes disadvantages, without resorting to being a necro or a wizard. Even those mighty classes will have to watch their backs if A thief is around, he could potentially kil them in one good backstab. And my new shaman won't have to worry about being rooted (I HOPE!!!), because if I get rooted, I am going to gate my ass back to the city.. bravery be damned...
