<P>Kitaira is a half elf Druid. She stand just under 5’6". Golden skin, not too dark, not too pale. Dark brown hair, almost so dark it’s black… yet when the sun glints on it, it might glisten with just a hint of auburn. Her hair is fairly short, yet a bit curly, giving her that tousled, just-awake look quite often. Her eyes are emerald green, with flecks of gold coming out in them when she is excited or angry. High cheekbones, full lips, long jet black eye lashes. She has a faint thin scar running along her collarbone on the left side of her neck disappearing into her tunic. Another on the outside of her left thigh. She has a silvery birthmark in the shape of a moon (think a quarter moon) on the inside of her left wrist. She has the best of both worlds; trim and muscular from her father… yet soft and curvy from her mother. Many people say she is quite beautiful, yet she pays little attention to her looks. She normally wears a rather guarded expression on her face, yet when she lets her guard down, her face lights up with a brilliant smile and her eyes sparkle with glee, showing her to be the young girl she is.

<P>She wears an alligator skin tunic tucked into snug leather leggings. A soft pair of leather boots adorn her feet. She wears no hat as she likes to feel the wind blowing in her hair. She has a medallion that hangs on a thin chain and nestles in the hollow of her throat and she occasionally will pull out her earrings and rings made from jasper… for special occasions.
<P>She can most often be seen armed one of two ways. With a large two-hand staff that she wields with expertise, or with a morning star and elaborately decorated shield that she is almost as good with.
<P>And this is her story.
<P>Alara was a wood-elf Druidess from Kelethin. She was quite fair, yet very fragile as well. One day while walking in the forest she was startled to bump into a tall human ranger who was out hunting. His name was Santho. The two youngsters fell madly in love and were soon married despite the community’s misgivings about having a human marry one of their chosen. Because of these misgivings, they tended to lead a nomadic life. Traveling about Faydwer in their search of adventure. Until it was discovered that Alara was with child. Wild with joy, Santho was determined to make a good life for them. He decided to journey to Freeport where he hoped to make his fortune. Promising to send for Alara as soon as he was settled.
<P>Months passed and Alara heard nothing from Santho. The child was born in Kelethin and given the name Kitaira. She was a most beautiful child, but half-breeds were frowned upon in Kelethin, so when the child was but a few months old Alara left the city in search of her husband.
<P>The journey to the docks in Butcherblock passed with no misfortunes, and Alara managed to procure their passage on the next ship leaving for Freeport. Soon after their arrival in the human city Alara fell ill, yet she continued her search for her husband. She found someone who thought they remembered Santho and they pointed her to the other side of the great continent; to a place called Surefall. It was thought that Santho had journeyed to Surefall because his expertise in fletching was sure to be needed there. Alara packed up her child an began the long journey to Surefall Glade.
<P>Along the way they traveled with a small band of gypsies who were selling their wares in various places along the way. During the journey, Alara grew continually weaker from her illness. The gypsies tried many remedies and potions, yet none seemed to work. By the time they reached the Glade, she was on her deathbed. Speaking first to a gypsy male called Trilan, she told him things about her child. Things that were to come in the future. Trilan listened but did not give the ill woman’s words much thought as she was obviously delusional. Then calling for her child to be brought to her, she held the girl close and whispered things in her ear. Kissing the baby on the forehead she handed Kitaira to the gypsy woman attending her and took her final breath. And so it was that Kitaira was alone before she was even six months old.
<P>The gypsies could not be burdened with a child of such a young age, so they arranged to have her cared for by a family that lived in the Glade. They took care of the baby and kept her fed, and clothed. They did not have other children however, and she was often left alone to get into trouble. The child had a quiet few years in the Glade, learning different skills, yet not being shown into a particular lifestyle. But she loved to be outside and seemed to have a natural affinity for animals and plantlife. So the couple left her alone to explore the area, always with an older companion to watch over her. She played with the other children at times, but for the most part Kitaira was a solemn and solitary child. She held herself aloof from the others, never fully understanding why.
<P>Five years after they had left her, the gypsy train her mother traveled with came back to the Glade. They camped outside the entrance to the Glade and the townspeople came to trade with them making for a festive atmosphere. The children mingled with the gypsy children and a good time was had by most.
<P>It was late one evening when most of the adults were about to go to their homes for the eve, when a curious thing happened. The children were sitting drowsily around a campfire near the gypsy wagons, with the adults behind them telling tales of their adventures. Sitting alone on a stump a fair ways apart from the others sat a solitary gypsy man. He was watching the children and smiling fondly at them, wishing he had been blessed with his own. He watched with interest as one of the children sat awake and listened intently to the stories the adults were telling. She seemed familiar to him, though he could not for the life of him figure out why. About to call it a night, he rose, but then hesitated as he could see the little girl whispering to herself as she edged closer to the fire. He stepped into the circle, about to ask who she belonged to so she could be watched and not burn herself on the hot stones around the fire circle. But before he could speak she got their attention by herself. The tale being told was about the spirit of a great gray wolf who traveled the plains at night. At the word wolf the little girl stood up and exclaimed "Wolf." Everyone looked at her and smiled indulgently. She made an adorable sight standing there. The firelight flickering off her rosy skin, her dark hair curling around her face. Just as her guardian mother was about to pick her up, she exclaimed again, "Wolf. See. Wolf". Her tiny face screwed up in concentration as she whispered again to herself and suddenly the child was gone. In her place stood a fuzzy, young wolf cub.
<P>There was silence around the campfire as they were too stunned to make a sound. The wolf cub simply sat down and looked at all of them, finally opening her mouth in a wide yawn. The image blurred and suddenly the little girl was back. She smiled innocently and said once again, "Wolf", before toddling back over to fall asleep near her guardian mother. The gypsy man who had been about to speak stood there with his mouth hanging open. He had seen the trick before. Druids tended to travel and hunt that way as it was much more efficient then normal forms. But never had he seen anyone so young even attempt to transform. It was a mid-level spell. The girl should not have had enough power to do it even if she knew the words to the spell. As the child rolled over in her sleep, her left arm was stretched out with her palm face up. As Trilan’s eyes took in the picture, his eye was suddenly riveted on the girl’s wrist. It bore the mark. The mark the woman of several years ago had spoke of. He had dismissed her words as delusions inspired by her illness, yet here was the child with the mark of the moon on her arm… showing promises of great power at such an early age.
<P>The space around the campfire suddenly erupted with talk. It was amazing said one. It was unnatural said another. The girl’s guardian mother simply sat there with a stunned look on her face. She was a simple woman and was unprepared to deal with things of this nature. Within minutes the girl’s feat had spread throughout the Glade and a small gathering of the leaders of the Glade had taken place. Whispering to themselves, they decided it was best not to leave the girl with her foster parents any longer. They were unable to teach the girl the willpower she would need to control the powers she obviously had inside of her. That coupled with the fact that the girl was simply too young to be doing such things, they decided it was best if she left the glade for a few years before coming back to undertake serious training. Knowing nothing about the mark on her arm, nor what it ‘supposedly’ meant, they were unsure of who to send her with. Trilan quickly volunteered to take the girl with them, and the leaders, relieved at having something to do with her agreed readily.
<P>She was bundled up and given to Trilan who made a bed for her in his wagon. The gypsy’s decided it was best to leave then, rather then risk a scene by taking the girl away in the morning.
<P>Kitaira adjusted quickly to their nomadic lifestyle and grew to love Trilan like a father. Disagreeing with their decision not to train the girl right away, he had immediately taken the girl to Rivervale and began her studies with the leader of the Druid Guild there. He would leave her there for a week or two at a time, before picking her up again to travel with the band. He grew quite fond of her and enjoyed watching her practice her skills. Traveling with the gypsies forced Kitaira to become a little more social, though she still held part of herself in reserve. In her 9th year, she was returned to the Glade and stayed for an entire year learning as much as she could before the wanderlust that would infect her soul forever kicked in. She sought out Trilan’s band and traveled with him again, stopping and training whenever they neared Rivervale or the Glade. In between visits to the guild he taught her weaponry skills to protect herself. She soon became an expert at using one and two handed blunt weapons.
<P>It was in her 14th year that she began to feel a yearning to be on her own. She was mature beyond her years and she talked quietly with Trilan and it was agreed she would be allowed to go. He had fears about this, knowing things about her that she could not possibly know herself. Things her mother had told him for instance. He had shared with Kitaira as much as he remembered about her mother and how she had searched for her father but never found him. He knew this bothered the girl terribly, but he had never found the trail of Santho either. Trilan had spoke nothing of Alara’s predictions about her daughter however. He did not explain the significance of the mark on her arm. He thought he would wait a few more years before she was ready for that. He also feared she was unaware of the power she had. She was in her 14th year, yet had already mastered spells that had some much higher level Druids stumped. She shrugged this feat off by saying she was just lucky and that they just didn’t try hard enough. His biggest fear was the girl’s trusting nature however. She had matured into a beautiful creature. Having been surrounded by the gypsies most of her life, she had no reason to fear anyone, and was trustful of anyone, strangers or not. He was worried that this trustful naiveté along with her beauty would get her hurt. But he had prepared her as best he knew how, and he tried not to let her see how affected he was by her leaving. Looking back only once, she waved, as she tried to ignore the burning in her stomach. She was unused to feeling pain and was not entirely sure how to deal with it.
<P>Kitaira began her travels of the world alone. She would occasionally travel in groups when she felt it was safer to do so. She learned that there were not-so-nice people in the world and was forced to learn to battle in fierce conditions. She continued her studies though not as diligently as before. She would run across Trilan’s band once in awhile and they would have a tearful reunion.
<P>On a cold winter in her 19th year, she came across the familiar sight of a gypsy camped and was overjoyed to see familiar faces. She ran through the camp with joy searching for him, not even noticing that people were looking at her with odd faces. Not finding his wagon, she stopped at the leader of the gypsies to find him. With a solemn face he sat her down and explained that Trilan had died in battle a few months before. It was bad enough that he was gone, but he had died trying to get her a gift. Last time she had seen him, she had told him of a great reptile that guarded a staff she wished to possess. He had gone to get her the staff and the mighty creature had slain him. Stunned by the news, she soon flew into a rage. Why had he been taken from her. It wasn’t fair.
<P>Determined to have revenge she immediately transformed into her customary wolf form and was at the oasis in a matter of days. She walked the land for hours before finally hearing a shout that the creature was near. In a blind fury she began casting spells that she had never tried before, determined to kill the creature that had slain Trilan. It should have been a quick battle. The creature should have killed her where she stood. She was not nearly of the strength to take it down alone. But in her rage she paid no heed to what should have happened. Ignoring the creatures attempts to bite her she continued her relentless assault on it, not realizing that she had drawn quite a crowd in the process. Tiring however, she let her concentration slip and he broke free of the root she had placed him in. With one quick movement she felt his teeth sink into her leg and she screamed in pain. His teeth still clamped down, she threw the last spell she knew at it and was relieved when the creature keeled over dead and she was able to pry it’s jaws off of her bleeding leg. A young cleric who had stood watching in awe used all his powers to heal the gaping wound. He did his best, but as he was young, the creature left a scar that she would carry always as a reminder. She took the staff he guarded and then proceeded to skin the creature and have a tunic made for herself. Only then did she allow herself to mourn Trilan’s loss. She did this alone. In the forest which was her home.
<P>She returned to her solitary ways and for the next two years traveled the country again, seeking something. She didn’t know what was driving her, nor where she was going, but she continued on. She met new people and ran across old acquaintances. She learned to love elven wine and hate the roots she foraged. She learned to swim despite her unnatural fear of deep water. She was greeted with a smile in most places where she was known. Her beauty kept some people at bay; others gave it a shot and were gently turned away.
<P>Somewhere along the way she freed a young black wolf cub from a trap he was caught in. Increasingly bold he began to follow her, always staying a few yards back. Amused by his actions she began to talk to him as she traveled. After tiring of calling him simply Wolf, she began to call him Tanthos. Gradually he began to sneak up close to her fires at night and eventually let her pet and feed him. They had been inseparable ever since; his keen ears and sharp teeth saving her on more than one occasion. He knew her moods better than any other; knowing when to stay away or when to come close.
<P>As she traveled she grew stronger and learned many skills to keep her alive while alone. She remembered Trilan’s tale of her mother searching for her father and did her best to keep her ears open for any word of a man called Santho, but so far she had heard nothing. She gradually lost interest in finding him, as she considered Trilan more of a father then anyone else. She never did overcome Trilan’s greatest fear though; she remained innocent and far too trustful of most that she met. It was through this naiveté that she ended up on a journey to Freeport with what, for her, could be considered a close friend, and a wizard whom she barely knew. What should have been a simple trip turned into a nightmare of deceit and death. She ended up wounded badly and fleeing for her life; carrying a deadly packet of herbs with her. Stumbling into a tavern in Freeport, she was befriended by an odd assortment of people there. Her goal had been merely to return the packet to it’s rightful owner, but so far she had been unable to do this. The wizard had tracked her down and was probably even now looking for her and the herbs he needed so badly. In the midst of worrying about him, she was taken hostage by a different ruthless wizard who had plans of his own. To escape, she had been forced to create something so horrid she could not even speak it’s name. And so she ran… back into the forest that was her home; where she was most at home… so that she could cleanse herself of the guilt she carried; just as she had when she lost Trilan.

<BR><font face=arial size=2><TEXTAREA COLS=50 ROWS=15 NAME="body" WRAP=VIRTUAL>&gt; Kitaira is a half elf Druid. She stand just

&gt; not too pale. Dark brown hair, almost so 
&gt; dark it’s black… yet when the sun glints on

&gt; the outside of her left thigh. She has a

&gt; a thin chain and nestles in the hollow of 
&gt; her throat and she occasionally will pull 
&gt; out her earrings and rings made from jasper… 
&gt; for special occasions. 

&gt; She can most often be seen armed one of two 
&gt; ways. With a large two-hand staff that she 
&gt; wields with expertise, or with a morning 
&gt; star and elaborately decorated shield that 
&gt; she is almost as good with. 

&gt; And this is her story. 

&gt; Alara was a wood-elf Druidess from Kelethin. 
&gt; She was quite fair, yet very fragile as 
&gt; well. One day while walking in the forest 
&gt; she was startled to bump into a tall human 
&gt; ranger who was out hunting. His name was 
&gt; Santho. The two youngsters fell madly in 
&gt; love and were soon married despite the 
&gt; community’s misgivings about having a human 
&gt; marry one of their chosen. Because of these 
&gt; misgivings, they tended to lead a nomadic 
&gt; life. Traveling about Faydwer in their 
&gt; search of adventure. Until it was discovered 
&gt; that Alara was with child. Wild with joy, 
&gt; Santho was determined to make a good life 
&gt; for them. He decided to journey to Freeport 
&gt; where he hoped to make his fortune. 
&gt; Promising to send for Alara as soon as he 
&gt; was settled. 

&gt; Months passed and Alara heard nothing from 
&gt; Santho. The child was born in Kelethin and 
&gt; given the name Kitaira. She was a most 
&gt; beautiful child, but half-breeds were 
&gt; frowned upon in Kelethin, so when the child 
&gt; was but a few months old Alara left the city 
&gt; in search of her husband. 

&gt; The journey to the docks in Butcherblock 
&gt; passed with no misfortunes, and Alara 
&gt; managed to procure their passage on the next 
&gt; ship leaving for Freeport. Soon after their 
&gt; arrival in the human city Alara fell ill, 
&gt; yet she continued her search for her 
&gt; husband. She found someone who thought they 
&gt; remembered Santho and they pointed her to 
&gt; the other side of the great continent; to a 
&gt; place called Surefall. It was thought that 
&gt; Santho had journeyed to Surefall because his 
&gt; expertise in fletching was sure to be needed 
&gt; there. Alara packed up her child an began 
&gt; the long journey to Surefall Glade. 

&gt; Along the way they traveled with a small 
&gt; band of gypsies who were selling their wares 
&gt; in various places along the way. During the 
&gt; journey, Alara grew continually weaker from 
&gt; her illness. The gypsies tried many remedies 
&gt; and potions, yet none seemed to work. By the 
&gt; time they reached the Glade, she was on her 
&gt; deathbed. Speaking first to a gypsy male 
&gt; called Trilan, she told him things about her 
&gt; child. Things that were to come in the 
&gt; future. Trilan listened but did not give the 
&gt; ill woman’s words much thought as she was 
&gt; obviously delusional. Then calling for her 
&gt; child to be brought to her, she held the 
&gt; girl close and whispered things in her ear. 
&gt; Kissing the baby on the forehead she handed 
&gt; Kitaira to the gypsy woman attending her and 
&gt; took her final breath. And so it was that 
&gt; Kitaira was alone before she was even six 
&gt; months old. 

&gt; The gypsies could not be burdened with a 
&gt; child of such a young age, so they arranged 
&gt; to have her cared for by a family that lived 
&gt; in the Glade. They took care of the baby and 
&gt; kept her fed, and clothed. They did not have 
&gt; other children however, and she was often 
&gt; left alone to get into trouble. The child 
&gt; had a quiet few years in the Glade, learning 
&gt; different skills, yet not being shown into a 
&gt; particular lifestyle. But she loved to be 
&gt; outside and seemed to have a natural 
&gt; affinity for animals and plantlife. So the 
&gt; couple left her alone to explore the area, 
&gt; always with an older companion to watch over 
&gt; her. She played with the other children at 
&gt; times, but for the most part Kitaira was a 
&gt; solemn and solitary child. She held herself 
&gt; aloof from the others, never fully 
&gt; understanding why. 

&gt; Five years after they had left her, the 
&gt; gypsy train her mother traveled with came 
&gt; back to the Glade. They camped outside the 
&gt; entrance to the Glade and the townspeople 
&gt; came to trade with them making for a festive 
&gt; atmosphere. The children mingled with the 
&gt; gypsy children and a good time was had by 
&gt; most. 

&gt; It was late one evening when most of the 
&gt; adults were about to go to their homes for 
&gt; the eve, when a curious thing happened. The 
&gt; children were sitting drowsily around a 
&gt; campfire near the gypsy wagons, with the 
&gt; adults behind them telling tales of their 
&gt; adventures. Sitting alone on a stump a fair 
&gt; ways apart from the others sat a solitary 
&gt; gypsy man. He was watching the children and 
&gt; smiling fondly at them, wishing he had been 
&gt; blessed with his own. He watched with 
&gt; interest as one of the children sat awake 
&gt; and listened intently to the stories the 
&gt; adults were telling. She seemed familiar to 
&gt; him, though he could not for the life of him 
&gt; figure out why. About to call it a night, he 
&gt; rose, but then hesitated as he could see the 
&gt; little girl whispering to herself as she 
&gt; edged closer to the fire. He stepped into 
&gt; the circle, about to ask who she belonged to 
&gt; so she could be watched and not burn herself 
&gt; on the hot stones around the fire circle. 
&gt; But before he could speak she got their 
&gt; attention by herself. The tale being told 
&gt; was about the spirit of a great gray wolf 
&gt; who traveled the plains at night. At the 
&gt; word wolf the little girl stood up and 
&gt; exclaimed &quot;Wolf.&quot; Everyone looked 
&gt; at her and smiled indulgently. She made an 
&gt; adorable sight standing there. The firelight 
&gt; flickering off her rosy skin, her dark hair 
&gt; curling around her face. Just as her 
&gt; guardian mother was about to pick her up, 
&gt; she exclaimed again, &quot;Wolf. See. 
&gt; Wolf&quot;. Her tiny face screwed up in 
&gt; concentration as she whispered again to 
&gt; herself and suddenly the child was gone. In 
&gt; her place stood a fuzzy, young wolf cub. 

&gt; There was silence around the campfire as 
&gt; they were too stunned to make a sound. The 
&gt; wolf cub simply sat down and looked at all 
&gt; of them, finally opening her mouth in a wide 
&gt; yawn. The image blurred and suddenly the 
&gt; little girl was back. She smiled innocently 
&gt; and said once again, &quot;Wolf&quot;, 
&gt; before toddling back over to fall asleep 
&gt; near her guardian mother. The gypsy man who 
&gt; had been about to speak stood there with his 
&gt; mouth hanging open. He had seen the trick 
&gt; before. Druids tended to travel and hunt 
&gt; that way as it was much more efficient then 
&gt; normal forms. But never had he seen anyone 
&gt; so young even attempt to transform. It was a 
&gt; mid-level spell. The girl should not have 
&gt; had enough power to do it even if she knew 
&gt; the words to the spell. As the child rolled 
&gt; over in her sleep, her left arm was 
&gt; stretched out with her palm face up. As 
&gt; Trilan’s eyes took in the picture, his eye 
&gt; was suddenly riveted on the girl’s wrist. It 
&gt; bore the mark. The mark the woman of several 
&gt; years ago had spoke of. He had dismissed her 
&gt; words as delusions inspired by her illness, 
&gt; yet here was the child with the mark of the 
&gt; moon on her arm… showing promises of great 
&gt; power at such an early age. 

&gt; The space around the campfire suddenly 
&gt; erupted with talk. It was amazing said one. 
&gt; It was unnatural said another. The girl’s 
&gt; guardian mother simply sat there with a 
&gt; stunned look on her face. She was a simple 
&gt; woman and was unprepared to deal with things 
&gt; of this nature. Within minutes the girl’s 
&gt; feat had spread throughout the Glade and a 
&gt; small gathering of the leaders of the Glade 
&gt; had taken place. Whispering to themselves, 
&gt; they decided it was best not to leave the 
&gt; girl with her foster parents any longer. 
&gt; They were unable to teach the girl the 
&gt; willpower she would need to control the 
&gt; powers she obviously had inside of her. That 
&gt; coupled with the fact that the girl was 
&gt; simply too young to be doing such things, 
&gt; they decided it was best if she left the 
&gt; glade for a few years before coming back to 
&gt; undertake serious training. Knowing nothing 
&gt; about the mark on her arm, nor what it 
&gt; ‘supposedly’ meant, they were unsure of who 
&gt; to send her with. Trilan quickly volunteered 
&gt; to take the girl with them, and the leaders, 
&gt; relieved at having something to do with her 
&gt; agreed readily. 

&gt; She was bundled up and given to Trilan who 
&gt; made a bed for her in his wagon. The gypsy’s 
&gt; decided it was best to leave then, rather 
&gt; then risk a scene by taking the girl away in 
&gt; the morning. 

&gt; Kitaira adjusted quickly to their nomadic 
&gt; lifestyle and grew to love Trilan like a 
&gt; father. Disagreeing with their decision not 
&gt; to train the girl right away, he had 
&gt; immediately taken the girl to Rivervale and 
&gt; began her studies with the leader of the 
&gt; Druid Guild there. He would leave her there 
&gt; for a week or two at a time, before picking 
&gt; her up again to travel with the band. He 
&gt; grew quite fond of her and enjoyed watching 
&gt; her practice her skills. Traveling with the 
&gt; gypsies forced Kitaira to become a little 
&gt; more social, though she still held part of 
&gt; herself in reserve. In her 9th year, she was 
&gt; returned to the Glade and stayed for an 
&gt; entire year learning as much as she could 
&gt; before the wanderlust that would infect her 
&gt; soul forever kicked in. She sought out 
&gt; Trilan’s band and traveled with him again, 
&gt; stopping and training whenever they neared 
&gt; Rivervale or the Glade. In between visits to 
&gt; the guild he taught her weaponry skills to 
&gt; protect herself. She soon became an expert 
&gt; at using one and two handed blunt weapons. 

&gt; It was in her 14th year that she began to 
&gt; feel a yearning to be on her own. She was 
&gt; mature beyond her years and she talked 
&gt; quietly with Trilan and it was agreed she 
&gt; would be allowed to go. He had fears about 
&gt; this, knowing things about her that she 
&gt; could not possibly know herself. Things her 
&gt; mother had told him for instance. He had 
&gt; shared with Kitaira as much as he remembered 
&gt; about her mother and how she had searched 
&gt; for her father but never found him. He knew 
&gt; this bothered the girl terribly, but he had 
&gt; never found the trail of Santho either. 
&gt; Trilan had spoke nothing of Alara’s 
&gt; predictions about her daughter however. He 
&gt; did not explain the significance of the mark 
&gt; on her arm. He thought he would wait a few 
&gt; more years before she was ready for that. He 
&gt; also feared she was unaware of the power she 
&gt; had. She was in her 14th year, yet had 
&gt; already mastered spells that had some much 
&gt; higher level Druids stumped. She shrugged 
&gt; this feat off by saying she was just lucky 
&gt; and that they just didn’t try hard enough. 
&gt; His biggest fear was the girl’s trusting 
&gt; nature however. She had matured into a 
&gt; beautiful creature. Having been surrounded 
&gt; by the gypsies most of her life, she had no 
&gt; reason to fear anyone, and was trustful of 
&gt; anyone, strangers or not. He was worried 
&gt; that this trustful naiveté along with her 
&gt; beauty would get her hurt. But he had 
&gt; prepared her as best he knew how, and he 
&gt; tried not to let her see how affected he was 
&gt; by her leaving. Looking back only once, she 
&gt; waved, as she tried to ignore the burning in 
&gt; her stomach. She was unused to feeling pain 
&gt; and was not entirely sure how to deal with 
&gt; it. 

&gt; Kitaira began her travels of the world 
&gt; alone. She would occasionally travel in 
&gt; groups when she felt it was safer to do so. 
&gt; She learned that there were not-so-nice 
&gt; people in the world and was forced to learn 
&gt; to battle in fierce conditions. She 
&gt; continued her studies though not as 
&gt; diligently as before. She would run across 
&gt; Trilan’s band once in awhile and they would 
&gt; have a tearful reunion. 

&gt; On a cold winter in her 19th year, she came 
&gt; across the familiar sight of a gypsy camped 
&gt; and was overjoyed to see familiar faces. She 
&gt; ran through the camp with joy searching for 
&gt; him, not even noticing that people were 
&gt; looking at her with odd faces. Not finding 
&gt; his wagon, she stopped at the leader of the 
&gt; gypsies to find him. With a solemn face he 
&gt; sat her down and explained that Trilan had 
&gt; died in battle a few months before. It was 
&gt; bad enough that he was gone, but he had died 
&gt; trying to get her a gift. Last time she had 
&gt; seen him, she had told him of a great 
&gt; reptile that guarded a staff she wished to 
&gt; possess. He had gone to get her the staff 
&gt; and the mighty creature had slain him. 
&gt; Stunned by the news, she soon flew into a 
&gt; rage. Why had he been taken from her. It 
&gt; wasn’t fair. 

&gt; Determined to have revenge she immediately 
&gt; transformed into her customary wolf form and 
&gt; was at the oasis in a matter of days. She 
&gt; walked the land for hours before finally 
&gt; hearing a shout that the creature was near. 
&gt; In a blind fury she began casting spells 
&gt; that she had never tried before, determined 
&gt; to kill the creature that had slain Trilan. 
&gt; It should have been a quick battle. The 
&gt; creature should have killed her where she 
&gt; stood. She was not nearly of the strength to 
&gt; take it down alone. But in her rage she paid 
&gt; no heed to what should have happened. 
&gt; Ignoring the creatures attempts to bite her 
&gt; she continued her relentless assault on it, 
&gt; not realizing that she had drawn quite a 
&gt; crowd in the process. Tiring however, she 
&gt; let her concentration slip and he broke free 
&gt; of the root she had placed him in. With one 
&gt; quick movement she felt his teeth sink into 
&gt; her leg and she screamed in pain. His teeth 
&gt; still clamped down, she threw the last spell 
&gt; she knew at it and was relieved when the 
&gt; creature keeled over dead and she was able 
&gt; to pry it’s jaws off of her bleeding leg. A 
&gt; young cleric who had stood watching in awe 
&gt; used all his powers to heal the gaping 
&gt; wound. He did his best, but as he was young, 
&gt; the creature left a scar that she would 
&gt; carry always as a reminder. She took the 
&gt; staff he guarded and then proceeded to skin 
&gt; the creature and have a tunic made for 
&gt; herself. Only then did she allow herself to 
&gt; mourn Trilan’s loss. She did this alone. In 
&gt; the forest which was her home. 

&gt; She returned to her solitary ways and for 
&gt; the next two years traveled the country 
&gt; again, seeking something. She didn’t know 
&gt; what was driving her, nor where she was 
&gt; going, but she continued on. She met new 
&gt; people and ran across old acquaintances. She 
&gt; learned to love elven wine and hate the 
&gt; roots she foraged. She learned to swim 
&gt; despite her unnatural fear of deep water. 
&gt; She was greeted with a smile in most places 
&gt; where she was known. Her beauty kept some 
&gt; people at bay; others gave it a shot and 
&gt; were gently turned away. 

&gt; Somewhere along the way she freed a young 
&gt; black wolf cub from a trap he was caught in. 
&gt; Increasingly bold he began to follow her, 
&gt; always staying a few yards back. Amused by 
&gt; his actions she began to talk to him as she 
&gt; traveled. After tiring of calling him simply 
&gt; Wolf, she began to call him Tanthos. 
&gt; Gradually he began to sneak up close to her 
&gt; fires at night and eventually let her pet 
&gt; and feed him. They had been inseparable ever 
&gt; since; his keen ears and sharp teeth saving 
&gt; her on more than one occasion. He knew her 
&gt; moods better than any other; knowing when to 
&gt; stay away or when to come close. 

&gt; As she traveled she grew stronger and 
&gt; learned many skills to keep her alive while 
&gt; alone. She remembered Trilan’s tale of her 
&gt; mother searching for her father and did her 
&gt; best to keep her ears open for any word of a 
&gt; man called Santho, but so far she had heard 
&gt; nothing. She gradually lost interest in 
&gt; finding him, as she considered Trilan more 
&gt; of a father then anyone else. She never did 
&gt; overcome Trilan’s greatest fear though; she 
&gt; remained innocent and far too trustful of 
&gt; most that she met. It was through this 
&gt; naiveté that she ended up on a journey to 
&gt; Freeport with what, for her, could be 
&gt; considered a close friend, and a wizard whom 
&gt; she barely knew. What should have been a 
&gt; simple trip turned into a nightmare of 
&gt; deceit and death. She ended up wounded badly 
&gt; and fleeing for her life; carrying a deadly 
&gt; packet of herbs with her. Stumbling into a 
&gt; tavern in Freeport, she was befriended by an 
&gt; odd assortment of people there. Her goal had 
&gt; been merely to return the packet to it’s 
&gt; rightful owner, but so far she had been 
&gt; unable to do this. The wizard had tracked 
&gt; her down and was probably even now looking 
&gt; for her and the herbs he needed so badly. In 
&gt; the midst of worrying about him, she was 
&gt; taken hostage by a different ruthless wizard 
&gt; who had plans of his own. To escape, she had 
&gt; been forced to create something so horrid 
&gt; she could not even speak it’s name. And so 
&gt; she ran… back into the forest that was her 
&gt; home; where she was most at home… so that 
&gt; she could cleanse herself of the guilt she 
&gt; carried; just as she had when she lost 
&gt; Trilan.
