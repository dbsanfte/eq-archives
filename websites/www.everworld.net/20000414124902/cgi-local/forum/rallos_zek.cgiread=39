<P>I do feel sorry for you fellow but one thing with

<BR>CC is that CC supports each other. If one CC
<BR>member attacks you, the rest will jump in no
<BR>matter if you're their real life brother :P
<BR>That's why the guild is so powerful. If you're
<BR>friend with one of them you better make sure
<BR>you're friend with all of them. If you pissed
<BR>one CC off, it basically mean you pissed them
<BR>all off.
<P>&gt; Preamble:
<BR>&gt; Radinn is an Erudin Enchanter. He had been
<BR>&gt; to rivervale once before after his Highpass
<BR>&gt; journey at lvl 4, and had made a friend or
<BR>&gt; two in the Rivervale area.
<P>&gt; Now at lvl 6 he decided to return, and
<BR>&gt; adventure with his friend.
<P>&gt; Situation:
<P>&gt; In the back of the Misty Thicket there is a
<BR>&gt; cave to Runnyeye, the local goblin home.
<BR>&gt; Radinn had camped for the night, and was now
<BR>&gt; ready for find this halfling friend.
<P>&gt; Turning invisible he entered Misty was
<BR>&gt; standing on the wall near the cave to
<BR>&gt; Runnyeye. There was type typical battle
<BR>&gt; going on with Goblin Warriors by a small
<BR>&gt; group of two halfings and one gnome. After
<BR>&gt; con'ing the PCs and goblins the battle
<BR>&gt; looked to go to the side of the players, so
<BR>&gt; Radinn started to talk with his friend about
<BR>&gt; meeting up in a few minutes.
<P>&gt; Now that the battle was complete I could the
<BR>&gt; small group running around below me then
<BR>&gt; stop and rest. Also the saw the gnome
<BR>&gt; staring in my direction. I was now visible
<BR>&gt; but taking any actions.
<P>&gt; The small group then stood up and turned in
<BR>&gt; my direction. I said hi about the time the
<BR>&gt; gnome rooted me. Next i was being pounded by
<BR>&gt; magical damage by a gnome and a halfing
<BR>&gt; cleric or druid. The halfing warrior
<BR>&gt; enguaged me in melee combat. All this within
<BR>&gt; a few seconds. I did not have gate
<BR>&gt; memorized, as i was prepared for a sealthy
<BR>&gt; journey and not for direct combat. The only
<BR>&gt; spell i managed to get off was invisibility,
<BR>&gt; which was useless by then as the the spells
<BR>&gt; and melee had me near death. Seconds later
<BR>&gt; Radinn was dead.
<P>&gt; In talking to one of the halfings, who I had
<BR>&gt; seen before in river but we did really know
<BR>&gt; each other. I asked why I was attacked. The
<BR>&gt; answer was that his guild brother (gnome)
<BR>&gt; wanted to kill me, and he had to help him
<BR>&gt; because he was CC. Next I talked to the
<BR>&gt; gnome. His answer was that 'I am a PK.'
<BR>&gt; There it is. There was no attempt to
<BR>&gt; communicate with me before the event. I made
<BR>&gt; to threatning moves towards anyone, and now
<BR>&gt; a gnome who was himself a recent new comer
<BR>&gt; to River decided my fate, because in his
<BR>&gt; words 'I am a PK.'
<P>&gt; I would call this random killing. I would
<BR>&gt; call this cold blooded murder.
<P>&gt; Misc:
<P>&gt; I have another another character who has
<BR>&gt; spent a good deal of time in Rivervale from
<BR>&gt; the beginning of P4. He personally knows the
<BR>&gt; two halfings who attacked Radinn. Although
<BR>&gt; they have been civil to him, he has seen
<BR>&gt; quite a number of conflicts involving CC
<BR>&gt; people in the area. The answer is often
<BR>&gt; similiar to the gnome's 'I am a PK.' The
<BR>&gt; wordy version is "This is the PvP
<BR>&gt; server. I am a PK.'
<P>&gt; I recognize that some people like the power
<BR>&gt; of playing a serial killer. I don't happen
<BR>&gt; to be one of them. My self and others have
<BR>&gt; noticed that these people tend to play gnome
<BR>&gt; and halfing spell casters.
<P>&gt; My overall impression of CC is that they are
<BR>&gt; an uncivilized lot who will build their
<BR>&gt; reputation based on the power of murder.
<P>&gt; All this is my subject view(s). Based on
<BR>&gt; experiences with CC on Rallos Zek. I don't
<BR>&gt; yet condemn the whole organization, but I
<BR>&gt; can say I have not meet anyone who I felt
<BR>&gt; was worth of any real trust. And I (real
<BR>&gt; life) am i trusting person.
<P>&gt; Anyone else who has experiences with this
<BR>&gt; organization please post your comments. If
<BR>&gt; you are a member of CC please say so up
<BR>&gt; front.
<P>&gt; Thanks, and see you in the EQ world.
<P>&gt; Radinn the craftkeeper.
