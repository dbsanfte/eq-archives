<P>> Sorry for the delay folks, I lost my original story due to

<BR>&gt; hardware problems but here it is. I hope you like it.
<P>&gt; E'gaile wanted to cover her ears but she couldn't, she closed
<BR>&gt; her eyes tight as if that would help keep out the insane
<BR>&gt; laughing. She fought back the tears once more, she opened her
<BR>&gt; eyes. She looked straight at her tormentor and shouted
<BR>&gt; "You're nothing but a coward, a mad insane coward!"
<P>&gt; He stopped his luaghing almost instantly, putting on a serious
<BR>&gt; face, devoid of any humor, or sanity and said "Perhaps you
<BR>&gt; would like to be the first to visit the world of the dead."
<P>&gt; "Yes, why didn't I think of this before? You shall be the
<BR>&gt; first living being to visit the world of the dead!" he
<BR>&gt; cackled with glee, "You shall make direct contact with
<BR>&gt; Miragul himself!" He began to pace rapidly back and forth.
<BR>&gt; "With the information that I gain from Miragul, perhaps I
<BR>&gt; can succeed where he failed!"
<P>&gt; "NOOoooo!" moaned E'gaile, "You said you could
<BR>&gt; summon the dead. Why don't you just summon Miragul?" She
<BR>&gt; looked at him as he paced back and forth, a wild light in his
<BR>&gt; eyes. He stopped suddenly and gazed at her silently for a
<BR>&gt; moment.
<P>&gt; "Summon the Great Miragul?" he laughed suddenly.
<BR>&gt; "No child, I don't have the strength to contain so great a
<BR>&gt; power, he was the greatest necromancer that ever lived, besides,
<BR>&gt; only his soul resides in purgatory. His body still walks this
<BR>&gt; world."
<P>&gt; E'Gaile summoning the last shreds of her courage jumped up and
<BR>&gt; rushed the mad necromancer, "No! I won't do it!" She
<BR>&gt; had almost reached the madman before she was brought to a sudden
<BR>&gt; halt by the bony embrace of his undead minions. Their skeletal
<BR>&gt; faces leering at her in evil delight.
<P>&gt; "Oh my!" he chortled gleefully, "You do have a
<BR>&gt; backbone after all. You will be perfect for this task." he
<BR>&gt; began to make a few gestures with his hands, "Sleep now, my
<BR>&gt; brave little mage. I have preperations to make."
<P>&gt; E'Gaile suddenly went limp. At a simple gesture the undead
<BR>&gt; lackeys began to bind the unconcious mage to a chair. After
<BR>&gt; seeing that she was securely bound, he looked over at Pigorsh.
<BR>&gt; "Come, Pigorsh. We have work to do." he turned and
<BR>&gt; strode out of the room, the little gnome on his heels.
<P>&gt;
<BR>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________________
<P>&gt; E'Gaile opened her eyes, her vision was blurred and she had a
<BR>&gt; splitting headache. She was laying flat on her back on a smooth
<BR>&gt; cold surface. She tried to sit up but she couldn't move, her
<BR>&gt; arms and legs were bound. She opened her mouth to scream but
<BR>&gt; found that she was gagged as well.
<P>&gt; Slowly her vision cleared. Suspended above her, hanging from a
<BR>&gt; chain of gold and silver was the orb. it glistened wetly in the
<BR>&gt; dim light. ' No! Don't look at it!' she screamed in her mind.
<BR>&gt; She began to fight her bonds. Slowly she became aware of a
<BR>&gt; voice, softly whispering. She could almost make out the words,
<BR>&gt; they seemed very familiar to her somehow but she couldn't quite
<BR>&gt; understand. Slowly she began to relax.
<P>&gt; The orb began to grow. She began to see shapes inside it's inky
<BR>&gt; blackness. Little swirls of light mixed into the jet black
<BR>&gt; surface. The whispering became a murmer. She could almost make
<BR>&gt; out the voice, but she still couldn't understand what it was
<BR>&gt; saying.
<P>&gt; The orb was everywhere now, she seemed to be a part of it,
<BR>&gt; almost as if she were inside of it. Flashes of light rushed by
<BR>&gt; at random intervals. It seemed like she was rushing headlong
<BR>&gt; through a tunnel, only there was no wind and the only sound was
<BR>&gt; that incessant murmering, steadily growing louder.
<P>&gt; A form began to take shape in the distance. There was something
<BR>&gt; about it that seemed familiar. That voice, she knew she had
<BR>&gt; heard it somewhere before. As she approached the figure it
<BR>&gt; suddenly dawned on her. She knew who it was, she recognized the
<BR>&gt; voice. The voice belonged to her beloved husband, Dain.
<P>&gt; She approached the shadowy figure, she recognized his features.
<BR>&gt; It was her husband. Her dead husband. He stood with his arms
<BR>&gt; outstretched, a smile on his face.
<P>&gt; "Welcome my beloved, I have missed you."
