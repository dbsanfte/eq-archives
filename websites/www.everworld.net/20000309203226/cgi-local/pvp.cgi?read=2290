<P>The pvp has become way to sanitary on the Rallos Zek server. I'd like to toss out a few things to add some excitement while leveling the field in some areas.

<P>1. MAKE SPELL BOOKS LOOTABLE. Whether it be just a single spell or the whole book. They should be lootable. I was origionaly thinking that only 1 spell should be lootable, but I'm now in favor of being able to loot the entire book. It just makes more sence that you would be able to take the whole book instead of ripping out a single page. This would be doable as long as you can buy extra empty spell books so that you can have a backup if your spells get swipped. As for the other spell casters out there don't whine about the cost of spells. Everyone has equiptment that costs money. A warrior's chiten tunic is worth a filled 1 - 4 lvl spell book and some. This would also allow a wizzard to create spell books they use for specific zones. With more than one spell book you could pick and choose. It will end up being more fun and interesting. Playing a troll Shadow knight I have few places i can travel without the possiblity of having to run across 4 or more zones to go find my body. I would luv to find some little halfling bound to the swamp kill him take his spell book and have him struggle to make it to the safety of Feerport. Its will ad more to the rollplaying that everyone whines about all the time.
<P>2. ANYONE THAT DIES SHOULD COME BACK WITH ZERO MANA. Being risen for the dead so to speak ( comming back ) with full mana just doesn't make sence. Any spell caster should come back with 0 mana and have to med to get it back. Will this make a spell caster vulnrable? Yes it will. They will be just as helpless as a warrior without their weapon. Just a lvl field. Can the unarmed Warrior kick the unarmed wizzard rear? I sure hope so, he / she is a warrior they should be able to.
<P>3. THE +4 / -4 RANGE NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED. 4 plus or minus is just to small. I'm in favor of switching to the +8 / -8 or removing the limits all together. Whats the use of becoming an awe inspiring lvl 50 if you can't flaunt it. A level 50 could attack a town causing the lvl 20's to band to gether to fight them. It will open up the roll playing experience. Will it cause anarchy at first? Problably, you will have those that abuse it. Till those that have been killed or someone above the pk in question hunts them down.
<P>4. ADD MORE TO THE EXISTING TRADES. ie smiths and tailors should a t some point be able to make magic armor and weapons.
<BR>Yeah I'm a wanna be smith. Not an easy thing for a Troll. Doable just not easy. So far I've sunk 150pp plus in the skill and I'm still under 40. I'd like to see things pay off when you get to a high skill lvl. It would make the whole trade idea more desirerable and interesting. Maybe an enchanter, a Master Jewler and a Master Smith could get together to produce magic armor that no one has seen. It would be interesting to see. I don't know much about the other trades so I can't speak for them. I just know that the pursuit of creating the finest weapon would become a quest that many a smith seeks.
<P>5. ADD AN UNDERGROUND ZONE TO THE OTHER CONTINENTS OR ALLOW EVIL RACES SPECIAL BINDING. I'd luv to go attack the dwarf of wood elf city. The only problem is that if by some miracle I get there. If I get killed I have to travel from a distant continent to get to my body / equiptment. If there was an underground zone between continents was implimented with some bind points, and evil guards along the way I would be more that happy as a lvl 6 Troll to go hunt wood elves in there home town. or add mayhem and fear to the erudites life. Just think of the rp experiences.
<P>WHETHER THIS OR ANY OF THE SUGGESTIONS WHERE MADE. I'd move sevrers if nessisary to get better rp experience.
