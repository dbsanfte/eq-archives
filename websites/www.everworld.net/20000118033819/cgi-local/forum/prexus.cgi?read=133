<P>Oh come on!!

<P>I do and have always respected everyone's views. That is evident in my posts. If you have ever actually watch, I never really do anything. I get the whole situation set up and then leave the results to whoever I am up against.
<P>I guess in this case it is you.
<P>Also, everyone is not on my side, and even if they were I would still continue this conversation. I have real issues, I don't like being disliked unless I really don't like that person to begin with. And though I have tried, cause it would be easier if I could, I don't dislike you.
<P>I didn't even really dislike Keshik, he just annoyed the hell out of me.
<P>Because of this, I want to make the best of things. I want you to understand why I do things. Because if you understand why I do things, maybe you won't feel attacked by my actions.
<P>Don't you dare tell me I am right and you are wrong, I sure as hell will not say that. I don't believe I am always right, don't quote me on that, I know better. My only problem is that you don't try to prove your points. You just say things, be them fact or opinion, they have no baring without backing by something.
<P>I always try to give some sort of evidence of what I am talking about. I could send you to my paladin arguements to show you that, but I don't remember which boards they are on.
<P>I'm not giving up on you, don't give up on this, or us. Us being the story, which is what it seems from what you are saying. I know Kit would be pissed if it was my fault that you ended up leaving, and we can't have that. Besides, you still have her wolf.
