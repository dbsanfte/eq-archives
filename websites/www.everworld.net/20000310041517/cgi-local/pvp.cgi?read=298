</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> If the scenario was: A PvP party of lvl 32, 33, 33, 34, 35,

<BR>&gt; & 35 comes upon a PvP party of lvl 23, 24, 26, 27, 27, 31.
<BR>&gt; The way it looks is the lvl 31 is screwed. What can we do here?
<P>Have it so that if anyone attacks anyone within your party you are automatically given the right to attack them back, despite level or race. Why would you not be able to defend your friend? Just because your 5 levels above or below the person that decided to attack your group.?. As it is exactly that, an attack upon the group not a single person and it should be treated as so.
<P>&gt; 1) Can we assume if you group with a party that you are
<BR>&gt; automatically accepting the High and Low lvl limits? (Assuming
<BR>&gt; we don't find a good way around the limits)
<P>I still think that having level limits on a PvP server is a bad idea, and hope that there is a good way around it. I have an idea... Why not make it so that anyone attacking someone below their level takes a much larger noteriety hit than if they were to attack someone equal or above their level. Perhaps even rewarding with a larger noteriety increase those that kill people higher than their level. I think that instead of having a level limit the noteriety system should be the way to control the pkilling, make it so that people are rewarded for killing people that are nearer to their level and are enemies to their race and punished for killing people lower than their level and friendly to their race. For example, a human warrior level 20 comes across a troll shadow knight level 15. Since humans hate trolls it would be common sense for the human to attack the troll. If the level limit was inplace this would not be possible and would hinder the actual role playing element of the game. Now if the human was to attack the troll and kill him his faction standing with trolls should decrease at a MUCH larger margin than if the troll sk was level 20. And the increase he receives towards humans would increase far less than if the troll sk was 20. If the troll was to win his standing with trolls would increase at a MUCH larger margin than if he was level 20, and his standing with humans should decrease at a much lower margin than if he was level 20. This leads me to my second point. Since the killing in this game is going to be mostly good vs. evil then I think a good\evil faction standing needs to be implemented and this faction standing will be modified based on who\what you kill. The way NPC's will treat you should also be based on this faction standing. For example I have noticed that there is a new tunnel system in freeport. If this good\evil faction standing was implemented it would be common place to find evil people traveling through the tunnels making it much more difficult for the evil people to travel around without risking their lives, as going above ground into town where the "good" people roam would almost ensure death by guards. If this idea was put inplace whole new societies of good and evil people would form adding a huge element to the RPG environment. It would also make for having race specific notorious people, trolls might want the head from someone that humans look upon as a hero. Implementing a new /con system for pvp wouldnt be a bad idea either. Or perhaps adding a few lines to the current /con which states something about what would happen to your noteriety if you attacked such person, or stated the persons noteriety with their race and with yours.
