<P>OK, i realize by now the pvp level limit is pretty much settled.

<P>But my guild had a get together this weekend and we played quite a bit. We came up with many important points during this eq fest.
<P>The biggest point is the attackable level limit that prevents players greater than 4 levels to attack eachother.
<P>Now, I hate to compare UO to EQ, there are such different games. But UO you could attack anyone. Sure, yer faction would change in UO (only 1 faction existed in UO, which was the guards), but the point was you could attack anyone. If someone looted yer corpse because you died to a creature, you had the option of going and killing them if you chose. This made the game fun. PvE is only fun for a short time. So PvP is the way to go for most after a while. And this level limit thingy is too harsh.
<P>Now, I'm not really sure why these limits are in. What's the worst that can happen? A level 50 player after months and months of playing, who is a "GOD", goes and kills a bunch of newbies. What does the lvl 50 player gain? Maybe 10 plat and some rusty weapons? Nothing really worthwhile for him. What do the victims lose? 1 weapon. or 1 best item of theirs, and a few coins. Is that so bad? Doesnt it happen now all of the time from looting? And how long is this lvl 50 player going to be killing these newbs before he's bored of of his gord? Even the biggest PK l33t D0od would stop after a week of this, tops.
<P>And what's the benefit of being level 50? How are you a "god" anyhow? You've just spent 8 months getting your character to the highest level, and you cant go kill someone who's talking scrap. So basically you do the same as when you were level 1. Wow, now that's a goal I want to reach, *not*.
<P>We that play on the PvP shard do so because we choose to. We know the risks behind it, but feel that's in a more richer experience that will be more enjoyable that killing AI mobs. We want to act out our agressions when someone in zone says something bad, or loots us.
<P>A suggested alternative would be after a level, let's say 20, it's open season. Sure, all faction rules would apply, but change the system!
<P>In closing, UO gave us that choice. You can get revenge whenever you wanted. Or die trying. That 4 hour old thief just stole yer Godly sword of ultra death and healing, and you cant do a damn thing about it. EQ, as is, just imposes what I see as a clumbsy and cumbersome rule that really serves no purpose, whatsoever. Disagree if you want, but I have a feeling most people feel the same way.
