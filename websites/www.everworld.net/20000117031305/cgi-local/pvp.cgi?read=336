<P>Over the years, I've always been what was referred to as a "Hunter." I used to hate PKers. (btw, I don't see PKer as synonymous with PVPer, a PKer is a PVPer, a Hunter is a PVPer, but a Hunter is not a PKer) After playing a certain game for so long, having visited all the dungeons, killed all the beasties, worn all the armor, wielded all the weapons and cast all the spells, I discovered that the real fun and excitement for me came from PVP combat. So I don't hate them anymore. They provide a source of entertainment for me. I've tracked down or ambushed and killed people that I like very much (PKers).

<P>Having said that, the reason I like the switch is that I will now be able to play the game from their point of view and still live with myself. Because there is a switch, I will be precluded from killing anyone who hasn't made a conscious decision to 'play with the big boys' as it were. With the switch, I know I'm not forcing my will on others, and I won't be getting my thrills at someone else's expense. That's important to me. Being a hunter, this issue didn't arise, as anyone who chose to PK, was de-facto consenting to being hunted, as dictated by popular culture.
<P>The switch does pose some potential problems for me though. First, if I were to choose to hunt, there would be a much smaller population to protect and avenge. Second, if I were to choose to pk, there's going to be slim pickin's out there. They go hand in hand.
<P>Hopefully, there will be a significant number of responsible PVPers out there who can maintain discipline within their own ranks. People who respect the PVP environment and work to keep it under control and fun for everyone. I'd like to see a way to keep the switch, AND implement some of the ideas people mentioned to curtail DEWD activity throughout the land.
<P>That's why I am so excited about this website and forum. It's a sign that there are a lot of intelligent and responsible PVPers out there, on both sides of the aisle, who want to 'clean up the sport' and have a good time. If we cooperate with each other and support each other for a common goal, we can have a good time and a positive gaming experience.
<P>In other words, don't shit in your own backyard.
