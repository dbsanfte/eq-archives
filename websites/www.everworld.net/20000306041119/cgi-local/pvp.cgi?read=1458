</STRONG><FONT SIZE=2 color=#FFFFFF FACE=arial>
<P>> This will be my shortest post ever:

<BR>Theres always a first..
<P>&gt; If these customers do not find roleplaying fun, why are they
<BR>&gt; purchasing a roleplaying game?
<P>Who said they dont find roleplaying fun? I just said that roleplaying should be enhancing peoples gameplay. Look, Everquest gives me more fun to play than any other game. I didnt buy it because its a roleplayers game, in fact I dont care if they rank it as a sexualadventure type or some quake like pointless killing game, I will buy it because I find it enjoyable to play.
<P>Everquest gives great freedom to people. Any game that allows players to walk around the whole virtual world means a lot of freedom. What I hate seeing is that people who are trying to have good time are being pulled and limited by some roleplaying rules that limit gameplay. After all, Everquest staff played gameplay over realism, that is why they had to put limits in game.. Gameplay is most important to them, and thats how it should be.
<P>Like my friend said, its crap to see two friends, neighbours , one is human other is dark elf necromancer ..and that they can't play together. They are best real life friends, and now they can't enjoy the game together just because one prefers to be a drow and other a human? Now here come your gameplay limiting roleplaying rules that take fun away from game. (I know this is not true, roleplaying IS GREAT, i am not against it, i just dont like seeing everyone being forced to roleplay in exact same way..eg racial wars, no same race killing, no random playerkilling (or should i rephrase that as "bandit attacks"? whichever gets to you, both are same things.
<P>RealmWeaver, I do support roleplaying, its great to have a game where there is dynamic plots and stories going on, where there are big sides and big wars, where there are roleplayed racial conflicts on.. This is great, and its wicked, but let some roleplay as outcasts. Why do people go about saying how those people who just attack and dont say anything are not roleplaying? This is ABSURD.
