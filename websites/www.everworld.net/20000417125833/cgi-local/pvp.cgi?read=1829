<P>I have to agree with Biggles, the fact of the matter is that you all have chosen to live in a world where bad things can happen to you from all directions. If you choose a PvP life, then you should accept the fact that other players have access to you, either alive or dead. It isn't about balance or economy, it is about being able to survive and a kill or be killed world. honestly. That 1st lvl character who looted 8pp and a good item could just as easily get whacked by someone lvl 3 on his way to spend his new found treasure, couldn't he? I can agree to the same lvl limitation as the PvP action is limited to (no one may attack 5 levels outside of his own, so no one should be able to loot 5 lvls of his own would make sense to me) seeing that the higher lvl character has no opportunity to regain his loot from the looting character unless he follows that character around until it is looted by a mob. Other than that basic limitation, I believe looting any corpse whether PvP killed or mob killed is definitely fair game and makes total sense to realism (it is an online game, but there has to be some attempts at making things acceptable to the senses) and to economy as well. Sometimes people are just in the right place at the right time, some people make a living by scavenging. It all works out and arguments against it are merely the whinings of people who want to have their cake and eat it too.
