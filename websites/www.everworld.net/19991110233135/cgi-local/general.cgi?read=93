<P>All I can say is... I'm glad no one has answered. Dude, enjoy the game first. Pick a character YOU like or one you may enjoy roleplaying. I have never played UO, but I have heard of the people who sadly don't know how to interact and ruing a good time for others. This is why EQ had to do what they did.

<P>Me, I created a Dark Elf necro, I would not mind getting together with friends and raiding an Elven town killing a few NPCs/PC of that race for a "fun & evil" roleplaying thrill. I certainly wouldn't kill anyone just because they were weak (even if I am "evil", but then thats why I don't play much "evil" in AD&D)
<P>Lastly, you want to find out if a Paladin makes a good PK??? Well, unless you can find some rampaging PCs, a Paladin should have NO business seeking to do murder in duel or otherwise.
<P>I don't dislike the idea of PK. I don't want to sound that I am down on younger people - I'm NOT; but it does seem that they are in the majority when it comes to anti-social VIRTUAL players. I won't espouse any theories here - I think we can all come up with our own.
<P>PK-ing should be just called "Justifiable" or "Murder" depending on the situation. It may be justified either in defense or for roleplaying reasons. It is not "bad" in and of itself. If we could handle it better, I would be all for it. I think for now, having it on an "all-PK" servr is best. Maybe critical mass will be reached and it will become workable for all someday. Sometimes ya gotta bash some heads... ;)
<P>--Dan
<P>&gt; Hail my friends... I have some very important questions for you,
<BR>&gt; that would make me choose a Gnome Necromancer or a Dwarf
<BR>&gt; Paladin.
<P>&gt; My probleme is that, playing on a PvP- server, I will PvP a lot
<BR>&gt; in war guilds and will have to duel A LOT !! But i need to play
<BR>&gt; solo too... So there is my questions:
<BR>&gt; 1) Paladin seems to be a bad choice for Dueling... I do not know
<BR>&gt; why, because they are strong, hard to kill, can heal, root and
<BR>&gt; have the "Holy Swords" (Any infos on them ?). So are
<BR>&gt; they Good or Bad in PvP (duels AND groups) ??
<P><... the rest deleted for space>
