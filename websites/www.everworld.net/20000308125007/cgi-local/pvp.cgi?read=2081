<P>I recently talked to a high lvl warrior (lvl 29) and i gathered some interesting info off of him about high lvl PvP-ing. he feels that at high lvls the real masters of PvP are not the wizards or other Int based casters its acctually wisdom based casters. thats right shamans, clerics and druids of which he said clerics are by far the best. he watched a fight between a cleric and a wizard the wiz rooted the cleric and proceeded to blast this guy to oblivion.. cept that the cleric had such a high resistence to magic combined with a high wisdom that he resisted nearly half of the total spells cast on him! the cleric just stood there healing himself. the damage taken and the damage given were almost identical.. the wiz then ran out of mana and sat down to med only by this time the root wore off and the cleric closed in and started to swing his big heavy hammer into this wimpy little wizard. the wiz was forced to flee and the cleric then blinded him and struck him down with melee and magic. he won the fight THEN the cleric healed up and cast a spell on the wizards corpse and low and behold the naked wizard poped up next to his body and the cleric proceeded to beat the smack out of this guy again. this went on until the wizard finnaly just disconnected.

<P>next off he saw a fight between a druid and a mage. the mage evidently was sitting a zone line and the druid popped out avoiding a train. the mage had his pet start to attack him and started to blast him with DD spells. the druid cast a DoT spell on the mage... then started to heal himself. and pet didnt him that much and the mage started to run out of mana so he ran.. the druid cast SoW on himself and ran off after the guy hitting him with his staff completly ignoring the pet. my friend doesnt know how this one turned out but the druid obviously had the advantage when they left.
<P>one last thought, this one my own. the most survivable (most able to not be PKed) has got to be the bard. he is un-rootable, he has DD songs that do not require mana and can interupt a caster, a bard that is able to kite cannot be caught or killed. the only way to kill an experienced bard is to kill em when they are low on health, very low.
<P>thoughts, comments?
