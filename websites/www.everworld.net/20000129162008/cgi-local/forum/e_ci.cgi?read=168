<P>Dearest and Most Noble Dwarf Brethren,

<P>I come before you today to inform you of a blight that has all but
<BR>overrun our once peaceful land of Butcherblock Mountains (prexxus). I am
<BR>coming to you as a fellow Dwarf and as a concerned citizen of Norrath. I am
<BR>Minat, a Dwarf Paladin that has lived to see 10 seasons pass. I have
<BR>endeavered to remain true to Norrath's intended stuctures and to uphold the
<BR>goals of Dwarves and Paladins everywhere. I fight for the just and protect
<BR>the weak, this has been my path. Unfortunately there are those on our server
<BR>who oppose this honorable behavior in every way. I am not speaking here of
<BR>mere 'kill stealers' or jerks, the evils I wish to expose go deeper and are
<BR>more wide spread than this. Butcherblock, as you know, has always been a
<BR>fertile land with bountiful prey for all levels of adventurers.
<BR>Unfortunately there are those among us who have taken to ruining BB(prexxus)
<BR>for the rest of us who live here. I am talking about Npc
<BR>killers,...particularly Dwarf Npc killers. Killing Dwarf Npc's has become a
<BR>sport for multiple bands of players of various races and classes. So much so
<BR>that not one single night has gone by that I have not witnessed the murder
<BR>of Glorin on the dock, or other various friendly Dwarf Npc's.
<P>Now, I am not opposed to quests, there are those among us whose quest
<BR>it is to seek out and kill certain Npc's to acquire certain items or
<BR>faction. This is not what is going on. It has become the SOLE GOAL of
<BR>multiple players to seek out and kill our Npc's FOR THE SHEAR THRILL and as
<BR>one offender put it to me, "for the exp,...i have faction to waste".
<BR>Nightly large groups of players dash through our lands rushing to the docks
<BR>for hours of guard killing. Not one peaceful traveler there can avoid the
<BR>mess. I would not bring this to you if I felt it would fade away on its own.
<BR>In my experience this phenomenon has been on the steady increase and shows
<BR>no sign of ending. On the contrary, players undertaking this behavior have
<BR>proved extremely beligerent and uncooperative in all ways. With all of the
<BR>challenges available in Norrath, there must be other ways these players can
<BR>build their experience! They are preying on the weak and as I believe are
<BR>truely afraid of taking any real measurable risks. So, I come to you with a
<BR>plea and a humble proposal, if you agree to join with me together we can
<BR>spread the word and rid prexxus of this blight, making BB safe once again
<BR>for the peaceful adventurers of Norrah.
<P>I have been diligently collecting the names of these repeat offenders
<BR>and their sympathizers. I am willing to make this list available to all who
<BR>ask for it and in return ask that they abide by my simple guidelines.
<BR>1) Do not duel or engage these individuals in any negative way
<BR>2) Do not group with these individuals or assist them in any hunt
<BR>3) Do not heal these individuals, give them directions, or answer their
<BR>questions
<BR>4) Do not provide them food, or assist them in finding their corpses
<BR>5) Report any new offenders to me and pass this information on to every
<BR>noble citizen of Norrath who asks
<BR>6) Get in their way, stand between them and our Npc's whenever possible,
<BR>prevent their hunt or at least frustrate it
<BR>7) Be willing to cooperate with us in the future with possible more direct
<BR>action like blockades at the docks,...or other proactive peaceful acton.
<P>My goal here is to just make this behavior more difficult and to send the
<BR>clear messag to these offenders that killing Dwarf Npc's for sport will not
<BR>be tolerated!
<BR>Thank you for your time and kind consideration, i can be reached at my email
<BR>or by sending tells whenever I am in Norrath.
<BR>Safe journey and happy hunting,
<BR>Minat
