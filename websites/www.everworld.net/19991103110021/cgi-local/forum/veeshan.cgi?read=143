<P>It has been brought to my attention, not by the person that posted, that someone was slandering me on this forum. A knd soul informed me of this sneaky person trying to malign my character and I now have seen ft to respond.

<P>To put it simply, many of the facts Kiron has related are true, though lke most people wanting to persuade others, he has left out relevant facts. I did in fact try and coerce him nto chargng matrket nstead of below market prices for armor. What he neglected to menton is that I tred to come to an agreement with him in a civilized matter before it degenrated into a war of sorts. Let me state my opinons now that people have had the opportunity to gossip about me lke a bunch of old ladies.
<P>First to the people that defended me I am greatful.
<P>Secondly my oddysey follows. For several days of gameplay I estimate in the are of 90 hours of time, I killed creatures and dumped all my money into smithing. I didnt buy armor or weapons. I didnt level appreciably. I smithed. I made over 1000 metal bits and experimented wth what would rase my level the cheapest way possble. I got hand cramps and went through a whole bottle of advil. Now I am one of the best smths in Norrath though defer to Lani who went through simlar trials and has me beat.
<P>Now for some reason people seem to think I should shortcut them. I should tell them what to make at whatever skill they are. should bring them up to my level out of the goodness of my heart. m a merchant, not a prest. I didnt break my wrist so everyone could benefit and not have to break theirs. I learned it the hard way, anyone wanting to catch me will have to as well. I wont give them any pointers. Anyone that dosnt understand this point is frankly not worth my time. Go into Microsoft headquarters and ask how they make their money and if they will show you how to make a program as good as theirs and market it. gather securty wll be called. Shall commit industrial espionage on myself ?
<P>I will not do trades with people because if i did I would never get any money. I would be constantly sellng this and that. My skill rses when I smith. I cant make more product without money.
<P>I routinely give away items. Today gave away 4 cuthroat rings to newbies . I dont see anyone else offering valuable merchandise for free.
<P>I dont deliver. If I did I would spend the whole night running from here to there and miss many cuatomers. I stay at some common locaton, lke the bank, and the customers come to me. Once again Im not in smthy for charity.
<P>I dont make armor if people give me the materials. Take a bunch of silcon, some wire, and other componets into Intel corporate headquarters and say, "hey here are the materals can you make me a pentum for free?" Ths time i gather your destination would be a psychiatric ward. Why should I go through all the long hours of hard work so you can have armor at the costs of materals ? Am I n this game just to help other people ? Am their slave ? I will not be.
<P>I dont discount my prices unless you buy a package item then usually ll give you a break. If you are buyng one item the prce I state is that which I want. Once again those wht problems with my prices can consult another smith.
<P>I dont have much patience for silly people. When I auction "Banded Cloak AC8 25pp" and 8 peopel ask me whats the prce or whats the ac on it, I get a little rritated. People that cant pay attenton are hardly my fault. I put that information in the auction because I get flooded with tells and answerng that question 40 tmes ups my workload and slows my response time to real customers. These are paying customers, not window shoppers. My responsablity is to the people who are buying, not those trying to pick my brain.
<P>Now back to the issue of pricing. No, I wont sell a banded tunic for 20 platnum. Yes, the materals cost me less then 10 platnum (of you forget about the times i fail making it). Why dont I sell the armor at low prices then. Even bracers which I almost never miss. Why do i mark it up. Two reasons really. One, I can and stll sell. Supply and demand works. Two, the principle of the matter. I remember UO where everyone 2 days old ran arouns in full plate. That was, well, stupid. I wont sell to people under level 5 and dont beleve they should be able to afford the armor. First of all its dumb. Second of all it makes all those that work hard for their armor look lke complete idiots. wll not be a party to super buffed 2 day old players at level 2 wearing full banded. If they get given it by a guld memeber or friend, fine, there is nothgn I can do about that. If they transferred t from anoher char have no problem wth that since they worked for it in the first place. However, I will not make it affordable to a low level. Now every now and then I will gve away armor items to lower players n a publcity stunt. That is pure adverisement so when they get the money they will remember me.
<P>Kiron, for all his vaunted talk about monopoly, was selling at prices so low a level 5 could afford many tems wth minimal discomfort. That is what bothered me. I tried to talk to him lke a cvilized person and his response was a two word phrase endng with "off." Ill let you fll in the blanks there. So I threatened him and dd n fact bury him. I dont see him sellign at all anymore makng my prediton of his banruptcy prophecy. How would all you paladins that paid 30 to 40 plat for your tuncs feel f someone sautered up tellng you you were stupd and he got his for 10 or 20 ? As for the monopoly ? So what ? Mcrosoft does it, why cant I ? If you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen. Business is a dog-eat-dog competition. Corporatons are daily ralroaded by other corporatons. It happens. If you cant take it, go into the clergy or somethng.
<P>Now for those customers willing to see these points, I would be happy to sell you armor at good prices and I can make every one of the items in any size. For those of you that think Im a jerk, thats fine, you are entitled to your opnon and really dont need you as customers anyway. m not so pressed for money that i have to take abuse from anyone.
<P>In concluson the VAST MAJORITY of my customers are great people just trying to have fun. apprecate them all. They see my apprecaton in dscounts and bendng my rules for them. thank them all for their business. Customers that are rude or nasty to me I promptly put on ignore. Nice feature that.
<P>Farewell and good luck.

<P>Send me a tell, Ill send you the prces =).
