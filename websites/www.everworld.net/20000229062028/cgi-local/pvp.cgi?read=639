<BR>Subject: Melee combat
<P>There needs to be some changes done to melee combat. As it stands no one who doesnt want to die to melee has to die. You cant be rooted if fighting only a paldin, monk, sk, warrior, ranger so you will always have the option to run. Once a sword starts hittng you you shouldnt be able to just turn around and run away. If you got SoW or journeyboots it will be way out of hand cause you can run twice as fast as your friend. anyone have any ideas how they could make it so it would be harder to run from melee combat? they make it so you slow down when you get 1 bubble of life left, but that is not enough.. maybe taking severe stamina loss when getting hit so you cant run?

<P>In Reply To: Melee combat (Tempra[CC])
<P>I fully agree, currently tying to keep with a "road runner" is just ridiculous. In fact the only melee type I'd currently even think of attempting to play in a PvP environment is the Shadow Knight due to it's one shot one kill ( occasionally ;> ) innate ability. Perhaps some sort of "daze" factor could be brought into play when one has been struck by a melee weapon?
<P>Any thoughts, ramblings, flames anyone would wish to add to this?

<P>I agree... you should you your "wind" knotched out of you when you get hit so it becomes much harder to run.... depending on the amount of damage done should change how much stamina you lose. I know if I got kicked in the stomach, I wouldn't be running anywhere very fast.

<P>This could turn into a legitimate problem for classes that would have to make do with out the "root" ability. Seeing as this is a forum for balancing PvP combat ( since NPC's don't tend to strafe on ya ;> ) Maybe we could hammer out an affective way of dealing with the "road-runner" problem in melee combat. The posts above are a start, hopefully some enterprising individual will be able to add something more to what is here already.
