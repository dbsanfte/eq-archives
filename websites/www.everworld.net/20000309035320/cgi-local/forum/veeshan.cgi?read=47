<P>"The Final Battle" - Veeshan Server - Story from Santiago, LOA

<P><img src="http://gamecore.net/everquest/screenshots/santi_end12_battle.jpg">
<P>It is not easy to run through the woods at night while drunk. Greyhawk denied that he was drunk, but for some reason he kept falling down. While lying on the ground, he would start to giggle for no reason at all. He could tell that the dwarves were angry at him for the delay, but that only made him laugh even more.
<P>“We should just leave him here,” growled Jarlaxle. “He’s costing us time.”
<P>Rothan shook his head. “We have to bring him with us. He is the chosen one.”
<P>“Chosen one? Who chose him?”
<P>“The gods.”
<P>“Hmph. The gods aren’t too bloody bright, are they? Kileyan, isn’t there some sort of spell you can cast that will sober him up?”
<P>“Aye, there is, but I couldn’t afford it.”
<P>Jarlaxle pointed his finger at Bierfreund. “This is all your fault, you know. If you hadn’t given him all that ale…” Bierfreund shrugged his shoulders.
<P>“I am not drunk,” said Greyhawk as he struggled to stand up. “It must be an evil spell of some kind.”
<P>“Yup. Uh huh. Sure.”
<P>“It must be,” insisted Greyhawk. “The goblins have foreseen my arrival, and they are afraid!”
<P>“Quit talkin’ like a bleedin’ fool,” Dargo snapped. “We have to get to the goblin camp. It’s almost midnight!”
<P>“Don’t worry,” said Greyhawk. “My legs are twice as tall as yours, so I can run twice as fast. Watch!” He began to sprint down the path, but then tripped again and landed in the dirt.
<P>“This is going to be a long bloody night,” muttered Dargo.
<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<P>The full moon had risen, and bats flew through the air overhead, their high-pitched cries echoing eerily through the canyons.
<P>Kherghon eyed the bats uneasily. “An ill omen, if ever I saw one.”
<P>The heroes crept through the forest as silently as they could, considering that most of them were still feeling the effects of the dwarven ale. At one point, Bierfreund stopped and turned around.
<P>“The goblins are on the other side of that hill,” he said.
<P>Walterus began to run toward the hill, but Eshay grabbed him by the back of his tunic and lifted him up in the air. His little feet kept trying to run.
<P>“Put me down!” yelled the dwarf. “I’ve got some goblin smashing to do!”
<P>“We need a plan,” said Eshay.
<P>“What for? Let’s just run in and kill ‘em all!”
<P>“While that is a brilliant plan,” said Rothan, “I still think we need a strategy.”
<P>“If I got close enough,” said Penaden, “I could play a magical song that would shatter their eardrums and make them wish they were dead!”
<P>“That sounds like every song you play,” said Jarlaxle.
<P>“Well, whatever we’re going to do, we have to do it quick,” said Kherghon. “We’re almost out of time.”
<P>“Let’s just run in and kill ‘em all!” said Walterus again.
<P>Rothan sighed. “All right. I’ll send my elemental ahead to lead the attack,” said Rothan.
<P>“Oh no you don’t!” cried the elemental. “You’re not going to send me to my death again, like last time! You know how hard it is to come back and forth between here and the Plane of Fire? Well it’s pretty darn hard, let me tell you!”
<P>“Fine. I’ll just send you back to Everfrost, then. You can guard something meaningless for a couple of years. How would you like that?”
<P>The elemental shivered. “All right, all right. I’ll do it. Good-bye, cruel master. I’m sure we’ll meet again, unfortunately.” The elemental drifted toward the goblin camp with all the despondence of a criminal awaiting execution.
<P>Walterus gripped his axe with both hands. When he thought about the coming battle, it was hard for him not to drool. “This is gonna be fun!” he said.
<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<P>Gumgum was not a happy goblin. He did not like the Butcherblok mountains to begin with, and the fact that there were mean little dwarves all over the place made it worse. But he was a member of the Green Dragon clan, and he had to go wherever they went, whether he liked it or not. To make matters worse, the clan chieftain was an utter lunatic. He was always carrying around a great big egg as if it was a holy artifact. Gumgum and the others wanted to cook the egg for dinner, but the chieftain would not hear of it. He would not explain why, but instead mumbled something about ‘waiting for a sign from the gods’.
<P>Well, Gumgum thought this was nonsense, until a lightning bolt fell from the sky and blew up one of the tents. The gods had spoken! The goblins stared at the flames in religious awe – all except for those who had been inside the tent, and were now running around screaming because they were on fire.
<P>Gumgum looked around, but the chieftain was nowhere to be seen. Instead, there were about a dozen dwarves, elves and humans charging toward the camp with weapons drawn.
<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<P>Walterus was a happy dwarf. There were few sounds as pleasant as the ‘crunch’ his axe made when it sliced through goblin skin and bone, and the high-pitched scream of agony that followed. He felt as though he was composing music as he fought his way through the goblin horde – crunch, scream, crunch, scream.
<P>He glanced over at Dargo, who had just launched himself into the middle of the fray. The dwarven paladin had lost his axe when he planted it in a goblin’s back, and he was now punching and biting his foes. The goblins were terrified of the little monster who was ripping them apart with his bare hands.
<P>Bierfreund and Kherghon had come in from the other side, and the goblins were caught in a dwarven vise that was slowly closing and crushing them. Greyhawk, Jarlaxle and Eshay kept close watch at the edges of the battlefield, making sure that none of the creatures escaped. From the top of the hill, Rothan and Kileyan hurled spells of fire and destruction. But more devastating still were the noxious songs that Penaden played on his lute. The goblins writhed and clutched their ears in agony, praying for a merciful end to their suffering.
<P>“Now they know how it feels,” muttered Jarlaxle.
<P>The battle was long and bloody. Despite their overwhelming numbers, the goblins were unable to pierce the solid ring of death that surrounded them. One by one, they fell to sword and spell. The end was drawing near.
<P>Then there came a sound that caused the combatants to pause. Even the dwarves held their blades in check, and stopped to listen as the entire valley echoed with a terrible, deafening roar – a roar such as a dragon might make.
<P>(to be continued…)
