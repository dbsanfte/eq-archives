<P>If you have had any of the experiences I have, you must be getting sick of not being able to trust anyone. I don't know if you recall my post about consent abuse (I had consented a member in my group to loot my corpse, he did and then logged with my things, never giving them back). Some of you said, "It's your fault, you are the idiot that trusted him." Okay, well, not being able to trust anyone SUCKS. Some people are okay to do things on their own, they like that sorta thing. I don't. I like the grouping and fighting, and I'm sure a lot of you enjoy it too. But for those of you who can't seem to find a group, have been screwed over more times than you care to remember by people you thought you could trust, or feel like leaning toward a darker aspect of this world, then you may want to join me in creating this guild.

<P>Either you have learned the hard way, or from listening to other's experiences, you know by now you shouldn't trust _anyone_. There are consent abusers, petty thieves, kill stealers, spot stealers, heart stealers -- someone always there to deceive you. This guild is about having a group of people there that you CAN trust. Our bond will be tighter than family. We will support each other in every way we can -- whether to help a member level, hold some kinda party or event, or to loot their corpse in a critical situation, etc..
<P>All of the guilds I can find here on Povar seem to be happy cheery sure-I'll-help-you-even-if-it-means-I'll-get-screwed-over guilds. Where are all the interesting, darker, untrusting guilds? I don't mean the kind that wreak havoc on the world for no apparent reason.. I'm talking about the mysterious group hunting over in the corner that always seems to be together. They will talk to you if they feel like it, and might even save your butt if doesn't mean their death. This guild should be composed of the most powerful and the not-so-powerful. Light races, and the dark races. Avid role-players, and the people that need some help. We are here for one another, and _only_ one another.
<P>I was looking for a guild like that to join, and found nothing of the sort on Povar. So, I'm going to do something about it and try and start it up. I just hope there are more people on Povar, like me, that would be interested in this sort of guild. We will be called the "Untrusters".
<P>I'm making a website right now that will have the proposed guild code, requirements, mission statement, etc. and post it later on. Whoever reads this, thanks for taking the time.

<P>P.S.
<BR>Some of you who know me are probably reading this and saying "Geez, what happened to HER? She was this bright cheery ..blah blah blah" Well, the cruelty of Norrath. We are supposed to be against the Orcs, the undead -- not act like them (I suppose depending on who you want to be).
