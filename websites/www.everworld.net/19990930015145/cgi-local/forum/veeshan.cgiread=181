<P>> "Lines In the Sand", Written by

<BR>&gt; Solflexion of Akalabeth
<P>&gt; It had been a downpour throughout the
<BR>&gt; commonlands all day, but now that night
<BR>&gt; loomed.. the rain had stopped, leaving the
<BR>&gt; air heavy and damp. The kind or air that
<BR>&gt; weighed in your lungs like you were
<BR>&gt; breathing water. The rain water poured off
<BR>&gt; the northern mountains in small waterfalls,
<BR>&gt; catching the last rays from the descending
<BR>&gt; sun. The brown cloaked figure's mood seemed
<BR>&gt; to mirror his surroundings, slowly fading to
<BR>&gt; black. He walked purposefully toward the
<BR>&gt; mountains, staff in hand.. helping him catch
<BR>&gt; his balance in the fresh mud. As he neared
<BR>&gt; the wall of rock and rounded a boulder, the
<BR>&gt; face of the mountains seemed to open up
<BR>&gt; before him.. a gaping, forbidding maw. A bat
<BR>&gt; squealed and flew across the coming night
<BR>&gt; sky, now blue as the sun struggled to
<BR>&gt; maintain it's grasp on Norrath... to no
<BR>&gt; avail. Night was here, and those that revel
<BR>&gt; in the dark began to stir. The figure
<BR>&gt; stopped in the valley and sat on a rock,
<BR>&gt; waiting patiently as the night darkened.
<BR>&gt; When the last rays of the sun faded, and the
<BR>&gt; moon took up it's sentry position.. his
<BR>&gt; appointment arrived. The moonlight did not
<BR>&gt; reach the valley, making the night seem
<BR>&gt; pitch black, so the figure did not see his
<BR>&gt; appointment arrive.. but he knew he was
<BR>&gt; there. The black robed figure stepped
<BR>&gt; forward silently.. and sat next to the brown
<BR>&gt; garbed man. They sat and stared across the
<BR>&gt; valley, at the blackness ahead of them..
<BR>&gt; contemplating each other's thought's, as if
<BR>&gt; they were simply reading each other's minds.
<BR>&gt; So different they were in so many ways.. the
<BR>&gt; blue skinned black robed figure was nearly
<BR>&gt; half the size of the dark skinned brown
<BR>&gt; robed man in stature.. but size did not mean
<BR>&gt; much, as both of these beings wielded magiks
<BR>&gt; more powerful than most knew of. It was the
<BR>&gt; blue skinned one who broke the silence
<BR>&gt; first.. 'Hello, Solflexion' 'Greetings,
<BR>&gt; Lochedahnan' the brown man replied. They sat
<BR>&gt; in silence a bit longer.. almost hesitant to
<BR>&gt; speak to eachother.. then Solf asked 'So why
<BR>&gt; do you request this meeting, my friend. It
<BR>&gt; is unlike you to seem so unnerved.' 'I am
<BR>&gt; not unnerved, just thoughtful of recent
<BR>&gt; stirrings within our guild... and I felt
<BR>&gt; that I must discuss this with you. I need to
<BR>&gt; know where you stand, should the lines be
<BR>&gt; drawn' 'Lines? Perhaps you should explain.'
<BR>&gt; Solf replied. Loche continued 'There seems
<BR>&gt; to be a growing faction that does not ...
<BR>&gt; 'approve' of those of us in the guild with
<BR>&gt; 'darker intentions'. They are just a whisper
<BR>&gt; of discontent now.. but in my experience,
<BR>&gt; such whispers are soon to become the booming
<BR>&gt; voices that are associated with crusades. I
<BR>&gt; am not worried, I have weathered such storms
<BR>&gt; before, and will do so again.. but I ask
<BR>&gt; you, friend, should someone drop this
<BR>&gt; gauntlet.. where do you stand?' Solf thought
<BR>&gt; for a minute, still staring at the wall..
<BR>&gt; and replied 'I know of these whispers you
<BR>&gt; speak of, and I agree that they will lead to
<BR>&gt; conflict. I am also suprised that you would
<BR>&gt; need to ask me this question, knowing all we
<BR>&gt; have been through together. 'I am not one to
<BR>&gt; leave anything to chance' Loche replied.
<BR>&gt; Solf grinned into the darkness .. 'of course
<BR>&gt; not, I should know that by now. Rest assured
<BR>&gt; my friend, I will stand by you and your
<BR>&gt; right to practice your craft in the manner
<BR>&gt; that you choose. I care not for the virtues
<BR>&gt; that you live by, for in the end, we all
<BR>&gt; have to answer to our own god, and we all do
<BR>&gt; what we must to win favor. You do what you
<BR>&gt; must, Lochedahnan, and I will fight for your
<BR>&gt; right to do so, politically and otherwise.'
<BR>&gt; 'I am glad to hear that, Solflexion, I
<BR>&gt; believed you would feel that way.. but I
<BR>&gt; needed to make sure. If push comes to shove,
<BR>&gt; I had to know you had my back.' 'For what
<BR>&gt; is a Necromancer to me, but an Enchanter of
<BR>&gt; the dead?' Solf asked. Loche answered 'And
<BR>&gt; what is an Enchanter to me but a Necromancer
<BR>&gt; of the inorganic?' They both smiled into the
<BR>&gt; darkness, knowing that as different as they
<BR>&gt; were... there were likenesses, and a bond
<BR>&gt; that was undeniable. 'Enough talk of the
<BR>&gt; future, and things that may or may not come
<BR>&gt; to pass.' Solf said,'Let us live in the
<BR>&gt; present right now.. I suggest we take
<BR>&gt; advantage of our impromptu meeting... I hear
<BR>&gt; that there is a Dervish camp in Northern Ro
<BR>&gt; that has just come into possession of an
<BR>&gt; entire crate of Kaladimian Whiskey...'
<BR>&gt; Loche grinned 'Indeed? then I suggest we
<BR>&gt; make haste.. or some unworthy heathens may
<BR>&gt; beat us to our prize' 'Once again, your
<BR>&gt; thoughts mirror my own' Solf replied. And
<BR>&gt; the two made their way silently out into the
<BR>&gt; night, as they had so many times before,
<BR>&gt; with purpose. Poor dervs. Info: Written by
