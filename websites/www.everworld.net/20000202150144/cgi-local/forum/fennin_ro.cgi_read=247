<P>Ah, Befallen. It feels much like home, and for a span of days it had been my place of dwelling, in a way. After having recently advanced within the Dead, gaining the glorious magic of binding, I decided to make an extended journey to that place of dust and decay, to hone my skills against the unthinking undead contained therein. When I arrived there I was well stocked in provisions, both those to keep me in good health, and those to summon my skeletal guardians. At the point which I begin to pen this tale however, I was running quite low in both respects, and was considering returning to Neriak, as a lone venture into the depths would not be the best of ideas with my depleted resources. It was as I sat, resting for the journey back to our beautiful city, that a most peculiar group stumbled from the mouth of the fallen fortress.

<BR>Seeing a dwarven warrior, and a human female who was obviously of the clerical profession from her garb, in an alliance was not so strange a sight, but the third member of their party gave me quite a start, provoking such undisciplined reaction from me that I actually raised an eyebrow in surprise. For their companion was a Shadow Knight of the Dead. My curiousity aroused, I graciously deigned to join them when they asked for my aid. I knew that their situation must be quite grim within for them to set aside the prejudices of their races and ask one such as I for aid. My experience fighting together with others of my own race was limited enough, but none had I had with any not of the, shall we say, *darker* races.
<BR>Introductions were swiftly made, and I learned that I was in the presence of the dwarven warrior Marcoo, the preistess (though she said not of which God) Protectionar, and the Shadow Knight Faousts. As we entered the first level of the haven of undead, we swiftly eliminated a pair of mummies and one of the impressive ice-boned skeletons who had wandered far from their typical lairs. I found that working in conjunction with a brutish dwarf, more living rock with a hammer than a mortal man, and with the healing talents of the human lady, was a quite advantageous situation. I circled the edges of the battles, occasionaly utilizing my power to shatter the magic of the undead, while carefully retaining enough of my energy to escape if the need arose. With casters of impressive power at his back, our dwarven leader became adventurous, a feral light gleaming in his eyes as he led us charging into the depths. After fighting through the terrible dread bones and a veritable army of new-risen mummies, we found solace in one of the fortresses long shattered rooms. As we sat there recovering, my companions chattering inanely of unimportant matters as I sat in quiet contemplation, a massive Ogre appeared seemingly of nowhere. His club slammed into my right arm, and I felt the tearing of muscle. I quickly fled, allowing Marcoo to take the beast's attention. With some difficulty, as my right arm hung uselessly at my side, I called on my power and drew the life from the brutish ogre. My arm swiftly healed, and then I sought justice for the beast daring to lay hand on one he should call master. His anguished screams as his blood boiled in his veins was proof that the lesson was well taught, as fell dead to the ground, smoking rising from the sockets where his eyes had been. My companions cheered each other at the victory, and the short one had the audacity to slap me on the back. I turned a cold stare on him in warning, but he had already turned away to search the body for any useful items. On the body he found a key, one apparently leading even deeper into the dungeon. At this point however, his resolve faltered, for he was not sure we would survive the deepest regions. He led us instead back the way we had entered, searching for any creatures we might have missed.
<BR>It was as we opened a door through which we had not gone that we were ambushed. A human wench dropped onto me, dealing a great blow to my lifeforce with what could only have been the harm touch of the shadow knights. I swiftly regained that lifeforce, draining from her frail body as Marcoo smashed her ribs with his hammer. We slew her easily, and I stealthily retrieved the key at her belt before Marcoo had chance to loot her, but the damage was done. Our comapnions, shoved by the attack of the wench, had fallen through a hole in the room beyond. Fallen, into the deepest regions of Befallen.
<BR>Marcoo stood shocked as they cried for help from the room below. I sat, regaining my magical force, and studied his face. It was an interesting thing to watch, some grief at the dire straits of his companions, some fear at the seperation's consequences to his chances of escape from our current situation, and pained indecision as a sliver of cowardice flickered in his eyes. I found it quite amusing, the anguish he went through, unable to decide between saving himself or attempting to save our companions, and perhaps dying in that effort. And so, with a combination of curiousity and boredom churning within me, mixed with the surety that I could make good my own escape at any point, a wicked thought occured to me. It was a wonderful opportunity for some further studying of those around me, and I exerted great effort to keep my amusement within, lest the corner of my mouth twitch upwards for a moment and give me away. I then leapt into the hole myself, landing somewhat painfully.
<BR>It was all I could do not to curve my lips in a slight smile from the boisterous amusement that filled me as I looked upon their faces. Protectionar, filled with joy at my apparent show of loyalty, Faousts, relief tinged with suspicion at the giving of aid from another of his race. And most beautifully, Marcoo, standing alone above, realization dawning on his face that he could probably not escape from where he stood alone, that he would have to join us and delve deeper if he was to have any chance of eventual escape.
<BR>We rested in that shattered room for some few minutes, and I then granted invisibility from the eyes of the dead to myself, the human, and the dwarf. Faousts, wishing to show his slight magical talents, cast the spell on himself. In retrospect, I was somewhat foolish to allow him to do so, as it cut our likely doomed trek even shorter than it had to be. For shortly after we left that room, we came upon one where dwelled a ghoul, and a pair of ice-boned skeletons. Many undead creatures lurked in all the halls and rooms nearby, and it was then that Faousts' spell failed. The ghoul was swiftly on him, and my lip twitched slightly at the new opportunity to better know my companions.
<BR>Faousts wore an expression of resigned fear, knowing that he was doomed, and that it was likely none would aid him, as to do so would risk almost certain death. I mused on the fact that our race was so different from the others of the world, that when in danger we know automatically that we will likely get no aid from our brothers, whereas many of the foolish humans indulged in ideas of valiant sacrifice. I knew that the most intelligent move possible for Protectionar was to gate away, as she was the least skilled among us, and would die swiftly if her spell was to where off. But, unsurprisingly, she did the noble thing, and began not to cast a spell of escape, but one of healing, trying in vain to keep Faousts alive. A small chuckle escaped my lips, for I could no longer contain my amusement, listening to Protectionar scream for Marcoo and I to help, as the dwarf stood there, frozen with fear. It was then that Faousts fell, the ghoul's teeth firmly lodged in his throat as blood spurted across the room to splash the terrified cleric in the face. At this point I began the casting of my gate, knowing that the time to flee had come. The last sights my eyes beheld as the spell carried me to safety were those of an ice boned claw driving through the human's back, reappearing out of her chest with her heart in it's hand, and the sight of Marcoo's face, his eyes filled with the certainty of his own demise, and shame at the fact that he had only stood, while his companions died.
<BR>Once again outside the dungeon, I sat resting, and meditating on all that I had learned. The aid of others could be quite beneficial, and I had proven through my careful study that I could easily abandon them if the situation become unmanageable. Perhaps the battle could have been won had we all fought together. Perhaps. But the risk to myself was almost as large as the chance of victory, and so I did the right thing in fleeing. Whatever powers my allies served may grant them sufficient favor to clothe them in new flesh, but it little matters to me. I have learned all I can from them, and it would be a long time anyway before they recovered from the trials of the day.
<BR>Yes, I had learned much of what fine tools lesser beings could make, and so when another dusty group stumbled from the dungeon, I was quick to rise to the opportunity for further study, offering my services. They gratefully accepted, as in Befallen even natural enemies band together to fight the "greater evil".
<P>Let the fools keep their illusions. I shall reap the benefits.
