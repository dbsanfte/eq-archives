<BR><blockquote>King Kazon Stormhammer was miserable.
<P>He did not like outsiders. The humans were tall, smelly and rude. The elves
<BR>were too damn happy all the time. And the gnomes…he didn’t even want to think
<BR>about the gnomes.
<P>But now his audience hall was full of these outsiders. They had traveled great
<BR>distances to come here, though Kazon wished that they would have stayed at
<BR>home where they belonged.
<P>Just when he thought it couldn’t get any worse, one of the elves began to play
<BR>a song on his lute. The king was about to order his immediate execution, but one
<BR>of the other elves seized the instrument and threw it across the hall.
<P>The king’s herald entered the chamber, followed closely by Bierfreund and the
<BR>tallest human that Kazon had ever seen. Bierfreund approached the throne and
<BR>bowed deeply. The barbarian followed suit, though his attempt at a bow was
<BR>clumsy and awkward. Kazon nodded curtly at both of them, and they rose and
<BR>retreated back into the crowd.
<P>“Everyone shut up now,” said the king. The room became silent.
<P>“If you haven’t heard the rumors, then you’ve either been asleep or dead.
<BR>There’s trouble coming…big trouble. Ralineth, fill them in.”
<P>The hall was filled with whispering as a shadowy figure stepped forward from the shadows.
<P>“Some of you know me,” said the archdruid. “Many do not. I am a guardian of the
<BR>land. I have set myself to the task of protecting the Faydark from those who
<BR>seek to disrupt the natural order of things. To this end, I have brought all
<BR>of you here this night. I have learned of a threat to our realm, the single greatest
<BR>threat this world has ever known.”
<P>“You mean…we’re out of ale?” Kherghon said, growing pale.
<P>“No,” said Ralineth. “Worse than that.”
<P>“Don’t see how things could get worse than that,” muttered Walterus.
<P>“The goblins are plotting to destroy the world,” said the druid.
<P>“Goblins?” laughed Dargo the dwarf. “I chops them with me axe! I eats them fer
<BR>breakfast! Goblins ain’t no threat.”
<P>“Normally, I would agree with you,” said the druid calmly. “But these goblins have
<BR>discovered something which makes them very dangerous. They have in their
<BR>possession a dragon egg, in which lies one of Veeshan’s brood.”
<P>“Who’s Veeshan?” asked Bierfreund.
<P>“Bloody big dragon,” whispered Kherghon.
<P>“The goblin shamans are preparing a dark spell,” continued Ralineth. “At midnight tonight,
<BR>the egg will hatch, and a new dragon will be born. As a result of the
<BR>goblin magic, the new dragon will quickly grow to such a size that our very world
<BR>will seem small in comparison. The goblins are insanely fanatical; they believe
<BR>that this dragon will favor them, and grant them power over all their enemies.”
<P>“Fine,” said the king. “I’ll send an army, and put all the goblins to death.”
<P>Ralineth shook his head. “The goblins have posted scouts on all the roads. An army
<BR>would be detected, and the goblins would have time to evacuate their camp and move
<BR>the egg elsewhere. What we need is a small band – about a dozen or so – to assault
<BR>the camp and put an end to their insane plan.”
<P>Kazon stood up and approached the assembly. “So what we need here is some volunteers.
<BR>That means you step forward and volunteer before I have you executed.”
<P>&gt;From the dwarves, Walterus, Kherghon, Dargo and Morgf stepped forward.
<P>&gt;From the elves, Kileyan, Jarlaxle and Penaden stepped forward.
<P>&gt;From the humans, Greyhawk, Rothan and Eshay stepped forward.
<P>“We’re gettin’ paid for this, right?” asked Bierfreund, who had brazenly propped
<BR>himself up on the throne.
<P>“You have about two seconds to get off my throne before I chop you in half,” said
<BR>Kazon, hefting his axe in one hand. Bierfreund grinned mischievously and
<BR>scurried into the crowd.
<P>“Now get out of here, the lot of you!” roared the king. “Don’t come back until you’ve
<BR>killed every single goblin in the Butcherbloks!”
<P>The king watched the motley crowd depart. “We’re doomed, aren’t we?” he asked the druid.
<P>“Pretty much,” said Ralineth.
