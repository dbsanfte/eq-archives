<P>> All we need is 3 hours and 1 gm. There are enough intellegent

<BR>&gt; PvPers to fill any group stuff we want to try. Also, im sure we
<BR>&gt; can write up the data ourselves and present it to them for
<BR>&gt; review....
<BR>&gt; Nafgar[CC]-Who wants to know if 5 druids can beat a group of 5
<BR>&gt; mixed characters at level 32.........
<P>Within 2 months of final we will begin seeing level 30 characters in force. At this level there is a number of things that balance and unbalance things. Wizards start getting some extreme damage firepower, and melee classes have full use and access to almost all magic weapons and armor in the game for the most part, By level 40 you have them all. I would really hate to have played a char class all the way to 40 only to realize that i was destined all along to get slapped around due to unbalance. The changes at this level don't even need to be coded into the game right away. After all it will be a couple months before it becomes an issue. We do however need to know now.
<P>It would not take long to figure most of this stuff out. Since all our characters are throw aways anyway at this point why not buff a few up and see what happens. I play a wizard char right now, and the general opinion is that a druid is still better. I however have had the chance to play with 30+ chars on the regular server and know that at that level wizards get some high damage spells they may be to much. We won't know becuase I have never used them in a PvP enviorment against a diverse class base.
<P>Anyway, it would intersting at this least to take a weekend and test this mess out so we know what we are dealing with before it becomes a customer service issue. See if you can get this done Geiger we really need it.
