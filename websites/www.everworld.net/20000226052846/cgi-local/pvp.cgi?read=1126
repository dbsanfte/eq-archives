<P>>The game is more dynamic when you have to be careful of foes that >have a thinking human behind them. The wars with the Dark Elves has >been a blast and played fairly well in role. I would have never seen >this amount of fun on the -PvP servers, pk switch or not" and this >comes from a guy who puts 12 + hours a day on the PvP server and had >put nearly that amount of time on the -PvP servers.

<P>Not only is the +PvP server fun and, I think CLOSER to what the developers planned, BUT the -PvP servers are NOT even following the roleplay they so cherish! Let me explain:
<P>When I was playin' on the -PvP server in P3 no one paid ANY attention to race whatsoever! NEVER! I consistantly aided and was aided by races that should have been natural enemies! Additionally, I never once even thought of using the language abilties provided. Why should I have? There were no enemies in the game and as such what would I have to hide when shouting?
<P>The bottom line is that the +PvP server is, in all actuality, a BETTER role play server than ANY of the others! The other servers simply exist as a place where folks go because they are simply afraid of direct agressive confrontation with other players. They conveniently use the crutch of 'role play' to hide their fears and cowardice.
<P>I am not criticizing the -PvPers for their desire to be -PvP. I am just critizing the LIE that the +PvP server is not a Role Play server and that it is NOT what the developers intented the game to be. Surely they did not want Dark Elves to be hangin' out with Humans like chums.
<P>Given Verant corrects the most glaring errors on our server, the +PvP server will be the ultimate source of entertainment that I am certain we have ALL dreamed of since Neverwinter Nights came out as one of the first graphically oriented massively multiplayer games in the early 1990's! (AOL sucked at $3 bucks and hour to play! Thats why I hate them....$700/month and they just sucked it up.)
<P>The errors I speak of are the ones we all know about:
<P>1. Factions are needed to make the server have some continuity and organization, to ensure that the players have a reasonably safe home area and that newb waxing is not prevalent.
<P>2. The spell resistances MUST be corrected! It is IMPOSSIBLE for someone even ONE level lower to defeat a foe 1 on 1. If someone attacks you who is YELLOW or RED, FLEE! If they fix the spell resistance, I'd imagine we will see more 1 on 1 fights. And group fighting will be more interesting still!
<P>3. Keep an open ear out for other suggestions from the players who spend enormous time playin' this game NOT just to make it better, BUT also because they simply LOVE it an are stricken with addiction! (not me of course)
