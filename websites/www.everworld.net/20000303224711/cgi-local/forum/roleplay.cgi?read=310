<P>"Agreed," replied Dawnfyre as the two swam the fairly short distance to the beach.

<P>Upon reaching it Dawnfyre shook his thick brown hair like a wet dog, trying to clear it from his eyes. Upon clearing his vision, he peered down the coast at the ship that had been the object of so much attention recently. There was no sign of the guards, but the deck of the ship was glazed a curious red color... a few of the men he'd noticed earlier stood there, as well as that dumb duo of barbarians (Gradnon seemed to have a bruise forming on his brow) and what appeared to be a Dark Elf! 'Quite a party,' he thought to himself.
<P>Crimson had vanished during the fight, and the Erudite and his prize that he was supposed to safeguard had slipped away in a long-boat. Well, at least that part of his job was over with, but he almost worried about Crimson. Almost.
<P>Dawnfyre turned to his new-found companion and recognized the star of the Lightbringer on his breast. He took Glodain's arm and began a slow walk to Northern Freeport.
<P>"Well sir, I am going to retire to the Temple of the Lightbringer and try and forget about this little mess and I would be honored if you joined me... any idea how all this happened?" he asked, though he knew perfectly well. But the less this unEnlightened man knew, the better and the best way to ensure that was to feign ignorance and uninterest...
