<P>Hear ye! Hear ye! Citizens of Norrath, EverQuest GMs and administrators listen up! This tale of consent abuse goes into OOC boundaries, and needs to be dealt with!

<P>Like I have done every night for the past few weeks, last night I logged on (7pm EST), gathered up a small group and went into Crushbone (9pm EST). An hour or so later, our group was attacked by a couple big orcs and we died. I was the weakest of the group, and when I got back to the entrance of Crushbone my group members were telling me it was unsafe to fetch my corpse. A member in my group, Horserider, offered to loot my corpse and bring me my things as I was sure to die again. Being the trusting Cleric I am, Horserider had seemed nice, and since he was in my group, I consented him. While he was on his way to my corpse, another member 'told' me that the area looked clear and I should meet them out there.
<P>When I got to the scene, Horserider was still in the process of moving my things into bags (I had a lot of stuff!), and I told him he could let me loot the rest, then meet back at the entrance so I could put my things on in a safe area. Right as I said these words, he sat down and camped. That was it, all of my things were gone. The only thing left on my body were my not-so-valuable boots and gloves. Boy, am I a sucker. The story doesn't end here folks.
<P>So then I started the racket. I told all my friends, shouted, petitioned, and all my friends petitioned. People I didn't know were petitioning and trying to give me things to make up for the items I lost. The GM that came to my aid couldn't do anything about it. I understand that it is an issue of me trusting someone, and not a glitch, but read on because it becomes an issue the GMs can deal with.
<P>When most of that madness cleared up, I grew tired (1:45am EST) and decided to log off. Which then, my father logged on under his character. Minutes later, when my father checked the /friends list, Horserider was on. He had been watching me through another character all night, waiting for me to log off. So then I started raising hell with him on my father's character, and told my friends he had come on. I logged onto my character (Crysta) because Horserider told me to meet him at the bank in Kelethin. I got to the bank in Kelethin and waited for him.
<P>He arrived at the bank, and started telling me my things were gone because his 'brother' sold them. I was enraged. Then he started saying he'd give me 200 plats for compensation, but he'd need to switch characters to give it to me. While we were talking, he was stripping down. From this point on, I am only assuming what he did. He then gave his things to friends nearby, and told me he'd be right back to give me the money. He logged off of Horserider, deleted him, and started another character. Logged back on, went to his friends and got all of his stuff. That's the end. I was left with nothing, suckered by a pretty good thief. I know I can't be his only victim.
<P>My point is, I don't want to see ooc thievery in this game, and I know a lot of you don't want to see it either. This is the part that I want the GMs to see. Fine, I consented him and lost everything, big deal. It's what he did with my things, the switching of characters and deleting like he just doesn't care. People that can do that shouldn't play this game. GMs and administrators of EverQuest, what are you going to do about this? Nothing is not an acceptable answer.
<P>Thank you to all my friends for caring and donating to me, and thank you to my aquaintances for all your support. Anyone who wants to comment on this issue or contact me directly, please send email to crysta@arina.net.
