<P>I have a lvl 20 ranger and just want to make a little rant about Melee classes on the zallos zek server so please bear with me.. there is no way a melee class can defend himself from a naked mage.. much less a druid.. "unless they have a higher lvl character to twink him" they cant put up a fight becuase there item dependant so if they get looted there totaly scewed.. so what does this mean to the melee guy.. "run and bag" if they were able to hold there ground and fight they would still probly lose because if they got attacked they would be at half life or under there attacker in lvls, but hey it sure would make me feel alot better about myself if i could take a wack at him.. in the place of screwing with my invantory while geting blasted.... i think it would make it alot better if it was that you could not looted equipt items and could loot bags and money... now i know this would make alot of you "bandits" upset if they do this... no more saying whow that warrior got a nice primary weapon and some good armour "i bet he cant bag it in time"...lets take it and sell it for however much i can get for it.... but hey its only fair it your runing around in "lore no drop" robes and some crummy ol' staff a gnoll droped you got nothing to lose.. while i on the other hand have everything... i just want the playing field fair

&gt; geting blasted.... i think it would make it alot better if it 
&gt; was that you could not looted equipt items and could loot bags 
&gt; and money... now i know this would make alot of you 
&gt; &quot;bandits&quot; upset if they do this... no more saying whow 
&gt; that warrior got a nice primary weapon and some good armour 
&gt; &quot;i bet he cant bag it in time&quot;...lets take it and sell 
&gt; it for however much i can get for it.... but hey its only fair
