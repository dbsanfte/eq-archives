<P>NUMBER ONE I HAVE PLAYED A WIZARD

<BR>Okay I made two main points in my previous post
<BR>One was that wizards have nothing to lose when they pk relative to a warrior as they can pk with any equipment what so ever.
<BR>-Someone responded saying that doesn't happen. To that person-> you do not know what you are talking about, it does happen and it happens alot especially amoung the random pk's a 20th level wizard that pks like this a lot is Bakatu(sp?)
<BR>someone else said that wizards can lose stuff to that at 1th level they have equipment that provides extra mana that can sell for 30 plat
<BR>--> So waht I used the word relative for a reason, at 16th level a warrior can lose a shiny brass halberd that sells for 150 plat, that is like saying wizards have cloth armor you can steal, big whoop relative to warriors its nothing.
<BR>--My POINT that these replied to was that I said that wizard should just be able to be looted somehow to comprise this like looting an entire rank of spells(which at 16th level does not come close to 150 pp)no where did I say wizards are just plain too powerful and that their spells should revole over just different levels of conjuring light globes. I merely stated that they dont lose nearly as much as warrior and that dorks are exploiting this.
<BR>Secondly I talked about how gateing from fights suck,
<BR>Someone said it doesnt happen----> it does if I miss with a 2 hander once and miss with a slam a wizard can gate away. And dont even say it happens cause i suck cause I dont the ability to hit has to do with probibility, my att vs their ac. And it does happen or the more popular way is to do the wizards verson of shadowstep then gate, this works well cause you can stepp a good distance from them, or shadowstep even behind your opponent which gives you time, enough infact to gate it has been done to me so I know, it has been done to others too.
<BR>Please make sure you understand my fucking post next time before you reply and sound like an idiot again, not one time did I say that wizards spells are too strong, or that root rocks you morons! i did not mention root once! yet I had fools replying about root! i could give two shits about root hasn't stopped me yet! and never will! not cause of traveling boots but because I am a prepared fighter unlike some, the are many tools thta can help non casters, there are items that have the affect of cancel magic, or bows something you can shoot while rooted, and sure a bow doesnt do 170 damage but wizards do have less health so 20 is still good damage agaist them besides the fact that if you interrupt their spell with it you waste their presious time until you get unrooted!.
<BR>All I am saying is that I am sick of seeing all these wizard pks running around with no equipment, or a full set of cloth armor and pking people and taking shiny brass halberds, and the like IN THAT SENSE IT IS WAY UNBALANCED. it has NOTHING to do with things like ROOT, SPELL DAMAGE, or the rate at which a wizard LEVELS!
