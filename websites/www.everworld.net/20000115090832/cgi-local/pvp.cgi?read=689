<P>> One thing that we all have to remember is that this is beta.

<BR>&gt; What we do and the problems we solve as PvP enthusiast will
<BR>&gt; determine directly what happens to PvP in EQ on all the servers.
<BR>&gt; We need to report every bug even the small ones so that we can
<BR>&gt; ensure that PvP will be a fine tuned machine come ship date.
<BR>&gt; I'll be spending a great deal of time on the PvP server and some
<BR>&gt; of the others. I forsee a great deal of fun happening in the
<BR>&gt; days of EQ to come. Please everyone bear with it. How many of
<BR>&gt; you will be playing on the PvP server? (Even if there isn't a
<BR>&gt; lvl cap now, I have already forwarded some of the ideas posted
<BR>&gt; here onto the dev team) We will probably have a rough start but
<BR>&gt; in the end, as it has been said in previous messages. The PvP
<BR>&gt; roleplay will be unmatched. I'll say right now that I personally
<BR>&gt; frown down upon newbie killing and killing out of role. Lets not
<BR>&gt; let the k3wl d00d mentality ruin a potentially revolutionary
<BR>&gt; experience.

<P>Am concerned on very last thing you said how you frown upon such random mindless killing... are you gonna favouritize players that are nice and play the way you want em (if so I'm outta here hate such stuff).. People should be allowed to do what they please, and of course laws are there made by game (game mechanics) and social laws that exist can be talked about and consulted to players when needed by GMs...even these can be easily fixed by ignoring the person, or even better on PVP server..by killing them...
<P>now for that frowning upon killing out of rule...sigh.. Roleplay means roleplay as someone else..(or yourself for that matter) so why can't I roleplay a character that is mute? yes MUTE... or he doesn't want to have his voice heard while he murders people so just incase some1 escapes, they can't identify them later (fictional explanation....one of MANY)..so I'm saying..PKilling should not frown on such killings. . "Hi.." (kills the guy) "Hahhaha"... this just enriches the game by making it more agressive ..adds revenge..and challenge to it..
<P>Newbie killing I agree on, but again don't punish people for doing it..I think PVP server will be mainly user run community...as in strongest guilds are the law actually so I think people wil actually take care of newbie killing... I myself would kick some1s as whos annoying non stop...
<P>Again on "out of character killing" I am not too sure what you mean by this, but again this shouldn't be punished at all.
<P>-Tarquin...just fighing versus GM favourtism and rule (sorry maybe I'm annoying, ..blame it on UO GM's...they got this thing into me...tons of favouritism and unfair and unequal player-gm relationships..)
