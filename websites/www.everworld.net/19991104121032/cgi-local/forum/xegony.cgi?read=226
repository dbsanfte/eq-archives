<P>I've seen this before and someone did manage to escape the guards and zone in time. (Took him about 10 deaths but he did it).

<P>Here are my suggestions...
<P><B>Method #1:</B>
<BR>Keep attempting the run over and over, you may lose a level or two (or three), but odds are good that you'll make the escape. This one will cost you the most deaths, but doesnt rely on others.
<P><B>Method #2:</B>
<BR>Get with about 4 - 8 people you know BEFORE you login, and have them stand waiting at the West Gate area. One of them should be able to cast camo or invis, another should be able to bind, a third should be a bard or cast SOW. Now, when you get in game, you want to be instantly targetted by your group and invited in. You will die this round, the point however, is to get in that group so you are easier to target for spellcasting. Once you come back to life, then move to the next part... Your bard should already be playing a speed song, or in the event that you opted to have a caster, have them cast on you quickly. Timing is everything. As soon as you're "speedy", get camo or invis if you can, but the goal is to make it to the zone line. Once you make it across, everyone in your party should join you (maybe forced if they are attacked by the fellow guards simply because of grouping). - Once you are across, goto Commons, then North Ro, to East Freeport and get bound in the sewer entrance.
<P><B>Method #3</B>
<BR>If all the above methods dont succeed after losing 3 - 5 levels, you may want to petition for help. Note however, that by the time they get to you, you'll have died a few hundred times and will most likely have lost several levels. If you don't have a group to help you with Method #2, then I would suggest petitioning upon login and keep attempting Method #1.

<BR><B>Fixing Faction</B>
<BR><hr>
<BR>Once you are bound in the sewers of East Freeport, you're going to either need to purchase Dwarven Ale, or have a friend do it for you. The stuff isn't cheap. Its nearly a gold peice each. I would suggest spending 5 - 10 plat on it. Keep extra in bank. - Take the Dwarven Ale down to the sewers to the thieves that hang out under Seafarers Roost. Give them to Breu Tema-something (sp?), you'll know him, its a quest, talk to him first : ). If you are KOS by him, then I dont know much to tell you. But that quest fixes faction with both the corrupt guards and the corrupt merchants of Freeport, as well as a few others (I'd spoil who and where they are, but its not necessary for this post)
