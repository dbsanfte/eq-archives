<P>I like all the ideas, I think the most important thing is if there is going to be a 4+- range it needs to be very possible for a lvl 12 to kill a 16, or a 22 to kill a 26 or a 46 to kill a 50, depending on the circumstances. Resist for pvp is something that definitely needs to be tinkered with if there is going to be a level range. Anywho, here are my ideas which I'm sure have been repeated a few times.

<P>1) No or little exp loss. In order for pvping to succeed it needs to be fun and as less tedious as possible. If people die like 4 or 5 times in a half hour period and lose a level or two, their will be people quitting EQ left and right. If their is a very slight experience loss it is understandable, but no experience loss would be the most practical for a pvp server.
<P>2) A "safety range" of levels for newbies. I've was playing on the pvp server today and their was already groups of higher lvl charcs (2s3s4s) grouping together and slaughtering 1s and 2s. Their needs to be a 10 lvl safety period where everyone has a chance to build their character. At level 10 most classes have the means to escape many hairy situations, and can take quite a few blows before death.
<P>3) As unlikely as it may seem, their are players out their who will camp corpses. Yes a likely solution to this is too organize a group to get your corpse, but for many, many situations this is not always a practical solution. I propose that for a few minutes after a play loots his corpse, he be given a short grace period to re-arm, grab his stuff and run, or do whatever. If a character goes to loot his corpse, his murderer might be hidden nearby to kill him again, caushing frustration to the player who is very vulnerable while looting his corpse. THe main thing here is that pvping needs to be fun, and it will cause a lot of frustration if a person dies, and has to walk long distances in a huge world like EQ to loot his corpse only to be killed again by his original assailant.
<P>4) This is more of ribbon then anything, some type of "stats" thing. Maybe in inns in a towns some type of board could be posted of the kill count for pvp players in diff zones of norrath, and maybe even the overall master kill in norrath. Im not trying to turn EQ into q2 or anything, but that would be a great feature to put in. PKs pride themselves on their efficiency in killing other players, and it would be nice to say that you are the baddest pk in all the land and have information to back it up. All kinds of "stats" could be implemented, like who holds the most pvp wins in which zone, who has the least deaths to most kills ratio, and so on. Its something that UO lacked throughout its existence (they might have added some kind of bounty board or something after I quit), and it was always something I wanted. I killed hundreds of other PKS and other people in Uo, it would be nice to know how many just for bragging rights.
<P>The main thing with all these ideas and suggestions that everyone is making is that PKING IS FUN. Verant has an oppurtunity to please both the PVP community and the PVE community because of the brilliant pk switch, and hopefully Verant will choose to do so.
