<P>I don't really care about your guild or your views, but I log on to EQ to play a game and have fun. My idea of fun isn't to be attacked by every little powergamer that happens by. That's not what EverQuest is. It's a roleplaying game. That's what it was made to be, and that's what it is. If you don't want to roleplay, then go somewhere else.

<P>My idea of fun isn't to be attacked every time I see someone from a certain guild, or even random players. I play on the PvP server because of the possibilities for enhanced roleplaying, not crap like this. Again, I don't give a damn about your guild or your members. I want to play and have fun, and as long as you leave me and everyone else who plays to have fun alone, then that's fine, but if you go around PKing randomly then you ruin the game for a LOT of people. It's powergamers like you that can drive people from this server and ultimately shut it down. I don't want crap from you, and i'm sure you don't want crap from me, so as long as you don't harass (many possibilities there) me or others with your 'superiority' like attitudes, GM intervention will not be necessary.
<P>I've said my piece.

<P>&gt; Like it or not, CC is on the PvP server.
<BR>&gt; Like it or not, CC isnt the best roleplaying guild in the world.
<BR>&gt; Like it or not, CC OWNS Misty Thicket and soon the world.
<BR>&gt; Like it or not, CC has few friends and mows down the rest.
<BR>&gt; Like it or not, CC is here in EQ to stay for a while.
<BR>&gt; Like it or not, CC has ruled other games.
<BR>&gt; Like it or not, CC is a tight group of some of the best power
<BR>&gt; gamers ever gathered who's goal is to have fun in
<BR>&gt; games that have thousands and thousands of players, only to come
<BR>&gt; out on the very top.
<P>&gt; We've been on hundreds of "lists", and have heard the
<BR>&gt; "My high level friends will keeeeeel you" story a
<BR>&gt; million
<BR>&gt; times. Even outnumbered almost always, we've come out on top,
<BR>&gt; evertime.
<BR>&gt; But here's a tip.....Most people that haved played in games with
<BR>&gt; us, usually have 1 common thing to say to us.
<BR>&gt; And that's usually along the lines of this......
<P>&gt; "Ya know. You guys are good. Probably the best I've seen.
<BR>&gt; And it really frustrated the hell out of me to die to you
<BR>&gt; all those times. But the fact that you guys stood strong, showed
<BR>&gt; me how a game can be played, made me try
<BR>&gt; harder, were always there when I did want to fight, all these
<BR>&gt; things has brought more joy and excitement in this
<BR>&gt; game over anything else".
<P>&gt; So, like it or not, when we come behind you and "keeeeel
<BR>&gt; Jooooo", or steal yer wife, or yer armour, or use terrible
<BR>&gt; role playing
<BR>&gt; speak, remember, yer not the first, wont be the last, and will
<BR>&gt; probably always look back and say, damn, that
<BR>&gt; really was fun.
