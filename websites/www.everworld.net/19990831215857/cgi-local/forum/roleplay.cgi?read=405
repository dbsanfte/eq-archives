<P>The wind blew the drow's long hair into his face as he spied on the two filthy humans camping deep in nektulo's forest. He slowly pushed his hair to the side and kept looking straight ahead at the the campfire. The only light was that of the campfire for there was no moon out tonight. The Drow slowly and carefully chose an arrow for his victim. He breathed slow and silent. No sound was made as he aimed in at his target. Finally the drow releases the arrow. The arrow pierces the male human's right eye completely penetrating the back of his skull. His female companion, completely terrified, jumps up screaming and crying. She begins to run into the heart of the forest completely blind and stumbling over rocks. The drow assassin walks into the light of the camp fire and grins. "The crying of this beast must cease" the drow said to himself. The drow chuckled as he saw the woman trying to run with her arms held out in front of her. For a great while the woman ran in circles stumbling and tripping over rocks. Finally, out of breath, she stopped and fell to her knees. She whispered prayers to her God, but all in vain. The drow walked up in front of her in complete silence. He bent his knees and lowered his head to meet hers. As he came closer to her face he felt her breath on his face. He grinned and whispered, "Vithir." The woman screamed in terror and fainted. He then sheathed his dagger and carved "DC" on her forehead for all her rescuerers to know who the masters of their destiny are. The Dark Covenant has surfaced in Norrath. May Vhaerun have mercy on your soul. We won't.
