<P>Most of us stayed in UO. I was a phase three tester who played for 2 weeks. Got bored of right clicking on monsters and fighting them for experience. So I decided to turn my pvp switch on. Guess what noone to fight. So half of my guild decided not to even bother to sign up for phase 4, for the simple fact we didn't know there would be a pvp server. I'm not sure if we would ever like the style of combat and the fact there are level limits and looting restrictions. We are not kewl doods, but like pvp combat. I imagine if they have a pvp server when the game releases to the open public you will see a group of dedicated people over there playing on it. Only time will tell. IMHO Middler earth with the permenent death option or Asheron's Call with the better and more powerfull items going to pvper's is the way to go. Asheron Call has a pvp switch but they give you incentives to go pvp. So we will see won't we all. I can tell you one thing I'll be staying with UO untill one of the new games comes up with a good pvp format.

<P>Uo allows for pvp in lots of different ways. Order/Chaos, Guild Wars, Murders, Bounty hunters etc.
<P>Here are some suggestions, First of lots of pvp players fight for loot, you have to allow full looting. Second, there should be no level method at all as far as attacking goes. Make the towns safe where you can fight but guards will attack the agressor also. Not super uo guards just like the guards you have. Allow bounty method of placing gold on peoples head. Also you have to keep in exp loss. Hmm that about raps it up.
<P>Remember one thing on Catskills alone there are litterly 2000 people who pvp daily. If you don't belive me look at there guild lists for order chaos guilds and the amount of wars going on.
<P>You have to support pvp in a big or you are limiting your marketabiltiy.
<P>Thanks
