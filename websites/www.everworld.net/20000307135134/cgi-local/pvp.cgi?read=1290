<P>You can't force people to roleplay, and thats the bottom line. Now there is a huge differnece between the guy who makes a characters geta a couple levels and stands at the home point and kills level 1's as they appear. Compared to the guy who stalks you when your not in a weakened state. The PvP system will be 80% guild based. Most of the killing that will go on will be between exsisting enemy guilds.

<P>Again, you can't force anyone to play your way, but the best part of PvP is you can group with your friends and strike back at the people you think deserve it. Yea, you may have smoked by that asshole CoOL DoOd one day, but the next you own him. What comes around goes around. Just take death in stride, be smart about what you carry with you and keep your eyes peeled. Most of the time you can see the attack coming. Anyway just my 2 cents.
<P>&gt; PK would be grand if not for the idiots. The PK system is a
<BR>&gt; system that has the potential of promoting a self-regulating rpg
<BR>&gt; society. It also has the greatest potential of raising an rpg to
<BR>&gt; the highest pinacle of an rpg experience. But.....(you knew this
<BR>&gt; was coming) the PK system, not unlike other well-thought
<BR>&gt; systems, falls prey to the type of people that it attracts. I'm
<BR>&gt; not saying that all PK'ers are bad people (most are cool i've
<BR>&gt; found in my experience), but, as you know, it takes only one
<BR>&gt; rotten apple to ruin a barrel of apples. For instance, the
<BR>&gt; Communist government system would be an ideal system if not for
<BR>&gt; all of the power-hungry and corrupt politicians (idiots and
<BR>&gt; @$$holes) who wind up running the show. In other words, it's a
<BR>&gt; system that relies on the intelligence and humility of all who
<BR>&gt; participate. The same applies directly to pk. If all PK
<BR>&gt; participants were the role-playing humble type and killed only
<BR>&gt; for rp purposes, this system would be one to be beheld by all
<BR>&gt; that played EQ. So i beg of you, if you're not intelligent and
<BR>&gt; responsible enough to game in a PK environment and do it right,
<BR>&gt; please don't get involved.
<P>&gt; l
<P>&gt; God bless all, and i'll see ya in final.
