<P>Ok this is just my two cents on improving pvp in EQ. I have come up with four things i think that would really help pvp in Everquest.

<P>1. Verant definatly needs to fix the loot bug. Its bad enough when your own race is looting you. But when you have 1st level characters of a different race looting you; then laughing because you cant attack them, its gone far enough.
<P>2. I feel that once you level you cant die and go back down a level. Example= Bob hits level eight, now no matter how many times Bob dies he cant go below level eight. Now of course if Bob was real close to level nine and kept on dieing, he would eventually loose alot of experience but never drop below eight again. I think this would help out alot, and not make it become a continous monster bash.
<P>3. I think to help out the roleplaying aspects of the game, races should really pay a big penalty if they attack there on kind. Be banished from there home town, by being KOS by the guards would be a good start. The reason for this is because the game is built around Evil and Good, and alot of people are really haveing a blast roleplaying this, but killing in your own race really hurts this. There should be a count set up, that never decays with time. If you kill lets say 8 people in your own race you are then considered a traitor to your own race, and will be guard killed on site.
