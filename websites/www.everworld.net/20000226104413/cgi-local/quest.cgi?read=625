<P>Ok, the Test of Truth consists of 2 parts, and heres how they go.

<P>In the Hall of Truth , go to see the NPC named Merko Quetalis.
<P>Ask him about the text in the brackets ( [ ] ) and he will give you the Note to take to
<P>Altunic Jartin. Altunic is a NPC in the East Commonlands, who sells shields. His hut is located close to the end of the zone.
<P>Follow the path at the beginning of the East Commonlands, and check out all the single huts on the way to see if Altunic is in
<P>one of them.Give him the note, and he will ask you to bring him the head of Squire Narls, a rogue NPC who has been stealing
<P>from him. In a few moments, Squire Narls should spawn outside of Altunic Jartins hut. I am unaware of his level, but is not more than 5 or 6. Kill Narls, and give altunic his head. Altunic will tell you that ne wants a shirt to keep warm, and will give you a
<P>few copper. Go buy a medium size cloth shirt, and give it to him. He will give you the Token of Generosity. The next part of the
<P>quest is to get the venom sac of a spider. You can find them on the desert tarantulas in North Ro, or the Large and Giant
<P>spiders in the East and West Commonlands. Bring the venom sac back to Merko Quetalis, and he will give you the Token of
<P>Courage I believe. Now comes the final parrt of the quest. Give Merko both tokens at once (not 1 at a time, or the quest will be
<P>messed up) he will ask you to find and kill a disgruntled Freeport guard, and bring him the token that the guard carries. The
<P>guard will be hiding inside the sewer, next to Merko. Be careful, the guard, I dont know his exact level, but he conned blue
<P>at 9. Kill him quickly, because if you don't he will run away from you and zone, and you will have to do the quest all over again.
<P>Also another thing, throughout the quest, your faction with the Ferrport militia will go down ALOT! Sometimes after killing the
<P>guard, people are KOS by the militia. Try and raise your faction with them prior to doing the quest. Ok, bring the golden token
<P>you get off the guard to Merko Quetalis, and you will gain exp, and faction, and he wil give you the teestimony. DO NOT, I
<P>repeat DO NOT, lose this paper. If you ever want to get the sword Soulfire, that Testimony is part of the quest! DO NOT LOSE
<P>IT. There you are folks, the Quest: Test of Truth.
<P>Humbly yours,
<P>Vizjeri
<P>Paladin of the 11th Circle
