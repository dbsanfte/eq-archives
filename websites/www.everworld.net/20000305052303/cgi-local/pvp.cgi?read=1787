<P>Unless you are interested in the CC affair you should stop reading here.....

<P>Darkhelm migh have been good when UO started, but then that was anyone that knew about the right bugs (remeber AoD and IC?). Not to say THAT he used the bugs, I cant know about that as I wasnt there and I dont know the guy. BUT I say this, you couldnt get far in UO at that time unless you used some sort of bugs. Remeber the first time Rain and I killed you? You where using the leather armour bug so that you was practically invulnerable vs our magic. I opened up with a Corp Por, and as I saw that didnt do any damage to you we changed tactics and used magic missiles. I still remeber you standing there laughing and saying that we couldnt kill you when you fell to the ground.... I was laughing so hard. This bullshit about Rain used Skip (me too) is soo fucking hillarious as I know for a fact that you guys used lots of bugs. ALL that played UO used bugs if they knew it or not. You were just too smart to not brag openly about it! That might be Rains only setback, he brags on stuffs when he just should keep his mouth shut.
<BR>I got of the subject here I belive. :) Those times I saw Darkhelm in UO I didnt think he was THAT special. Call it bad luck or anything but I dont see him as a major player in your guild, I could be wrong of course and if so I beg of his forgiveness. LOL!
<BR>Hmm "crappy" might not be the right word as you guys often got witty responses. But im just a dumb foreigner as you know. :)
<BR>I think that you still got the picture of what I meant anyways. Sometimes its better to let things go by then flame every stupid twits post. But then again any publicity is good publicity, are you trying to pull a LLTS? :)
<P>/Shakula of Snuffers - You guys are good, but dont get that godlike complex that some others we know so well.... I wonders how you guys get any time to actually play the game when you post on every messageboard? :)
<P>&gt; Darkhelm Da Bad a nobody? Please Shak Dark was a legend in UO
<BR>&gt; long before anyone had heard of you or Raingimp and even before
<BR>&gt; CC was formed. Hell he and Lan used to be bigtime enemies back
<BR>&gt; in our delusional Anti-pk days ;) And while we're on the
<BR>&gt; subject... since when does CC give a damn whether anyone
<BR>&gt; approves of our actions, we do as we please, and seem to draw
<BR>&gt; eyes to us out of habit, not intention. I also find it hard to
<BR>&gt; believe you could actually call any reponse CC has submitted
<BR>&gt; 'crappy' after you posted this piece of garbage flame Shak. You
<BR>&gt; see no CC asking for attention here... Most of these morons just
<BR>&gt; need something to complain about and as I said before, I will
<BR>&gt; gladly be your villain.
<P>&gt; Seo, your villainous idol
<BR>&gt; ps: A few good players? You know better, tsk tsk. Verrry
<BR>&gt; small...
