<P>Sorry for the delay folks, I lost my original story due to hardware problems but here it is. I hope you like it.

<P><I>E'gaile wanted to cover her ears but she couldn't, she closed her eyes tight as if that would help keep out the insane laughing. She fought back the tears once more, she opened her eyes. She looked straight at her tormentor and shouted "You're nothing but a coward, a mad insane coward!"
<P>He stopped his luaghing almost instantly, putting on a serious face, devoid of any humor, or sanity and said "Perhaps you would like to be the first to visit the world of the dead."</I>
<P>"Yes, why didn't I think of this before? You shall be the first living being to visit the world of the dead!" he cackled with glee, "You shall make direct contact with Miragul himself!" He began to pace rapidly back and forth. "With the information that I gain from Miragul, perhaps I can succeed where he failed!"
<P>"NOOoooo!" moaned E'gaile, "You said you could summon the dead. Why don't you just summon Miragul?" She looked at him as he paced back and forth, a wild light in his eyes. He stopped suddenly and gazed at her silently for a moment.
<P>"Summon the Great Miragul?" he laughed suddenly. "No child, I don't have the strength to contain so great a power, he was the greatest necromancer that ever lived, besides, only his soul resides in purgatory. His body still walks this world."
<P>E'Gaile summoning the last shreds of her courage jumped up and rushed the mad necromancer, "No! I won't do it!" She had almost reached the madman before she was brought to a sudden halt by the bony embrace of his undead minions. Their skeletal faces leering at her in evil delight.
<P>"Oh my!" he chortled gleefully, "You do have a backbone after all. You will be perfect for this task." he began to make a few gestures with his hands, "Sleep now, my brave little mage. I have preperations to make."
<P>E'Gaile suddenly went limp. At a simple gesture the undead lackeys began to bind the unconcious mage to a chair. After seeing that she was securely bound, he looked over at Pigorsh. "Come, Pigorsh. We have work to do." he turned and strode out of the room, the little gnome on his heels.
<P>________________________________________________________________________________
<P>E'Gaile opened her eyes, her vision was blurred and she had a splitting headache. She was laying flat on her back on a smooth cold surface. She tried to sit up but she couldn't move, her arms and legs were bound. She opened her mouth to scream but found that she was gagged as well.
<P>Slowly her vision cleared. Suspended above her, hanging from a chain of gold and silver was the orb. it glistened wetly in the dim light. <I>' No! Don't look at it!'</I> she screamed in her mind. She began to fight her bonds. Slowly she became aware of a voice, softly whispering. She could almost make out the words, they seemed very familiar to her somehow but she couldn't quite understand. Slowly she began to relax.
<P>The orb began to grow. She began to see shapes inside it's inky blackness. Little swirls of light mixed into the jet black surface. The whispering became a murmer. She could almost make out the voice, but she still couldn't understand what it was saying.
<P>The orb was everywhere now, she seemed to be a part of it, almost as if she were inside of it. Flashes of light rushed by at random intervals. It seemed like she was rushing headlong through a tunnel, only there was no wind and the only sound was that incessant murmering, steadily growing louder.
<P>A form began to take shape in the distance. There was something about it that seemed familiar. That voice, she knew she had heard it somewhere before. As she approached the figure it suddenly dawned on her. She knew who it was, she recognized the voice. The voice belonged to her beloved husband, Dain.
<P>She approached the shadowy figure, she recognized his features. It was her husband. Her dead husband. He stood with his arms outstretched, a smile on his face.
<P>"Welcome my beloved, I have missed you."
