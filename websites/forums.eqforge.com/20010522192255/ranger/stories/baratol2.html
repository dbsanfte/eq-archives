                I have never truly understood the human race. I myself am the 
                product of the union between two half-elves. What amazes me so 
                is how humans can vary between the two extremes of pure goodness 
                and blackest evil so much and so often. While for the other races, 
                there is a general attitude that can usually be assumed true. 
                With humans, that is totally impossible. You can never be sure 
                which way a person leans unless you really know him or her. In 
                a recent experience of mine, I encountered two persons who each 
                embodied totally opposite ends of the spectrum. <br>
                <br>
                At the time, I'd just learned the basics of spellcasting, having 
                attained 9th circle. After testing my newfound magical powers 
                for a short while, I returned to BlackBurrow for what I planned 
                to be a short trip helping fellow adventurers in need. <br>
                <br>
                I'd barely settled into a comfortable position at a common rest 
                area before a haggard man stumbled up besides me. I cast a healing 
                spell or two, and he smiled in gratitude. After a few moments' 
                rest, he turned to me and said, "Thank you, kind sir, for your 
                assistance. I am Styris Cormisen. If I could ask ye for a favor, 
                I would be most thankful." Intrigued, I nodded for him to proceed. 
                "I have been trying to retrieve a rather valuable item I left 
                in the caverns. It is a pendant with a green gemstone set in it. 
                As you can see, I have failed in my first attempt. Could I impose 
                on you to aid me in this endeavor?" Having nothing else to accomplish 
                and this type of thing being one of my goals for this trip, I 
                readily agreed and gathered my equipment. <br>
                <br>
                We carefully picked our way deep into the gnolls' lair. Judging 
                by the massive sword strapped to his back, I guessed my companion 
                was a warrior. We encountered a few weaker gnolls as we ventured. 
                He seemed to confirm my guess by the ease and practice with which 
                he wielded his weapon. I hung back and loosed arrows while he 
                swung his deadly sword. In this manner, we easily dispatched the 
                dogs that blocked our way. <br>
                <br>
                Finally, we reached a long corridor with several large alcoves 
                set in each side. Styris stopped and held up a hand. "I lost it 
                here. I believe it to be within one of these alcoves. Be wary, 
                as this hall swarms with guardsmen. You search the right side, 
                I shall investigate the other." I nodded my agreement and poked 
                into the first alcove. It widened out slightly into a small room 
                with a sturdy door in back. I kept my trusty minotaur axe ready 
                and searched the room. I found nothing. I nodded to Styris and 
                went to the next alcove. A young gnoll had his back to me. He 
                was standing in front of a table. I silently swung my axe, and 
                gnoll jerked as my axe bit deeply into its back. On the table 
                was a sturdy locked box. I shrugged to myself and hacked off the 
                lock. All I found were a few gold pieces, which I pocketed. The 
                box still seemed too heavy. Frowning, I took out my knife and 
                pried up the bottom. It popped off easily and revealed a hidden 
                compartment. The missing pendant was inside. The gemstones glittered 
                in the torchlight. I stared at it for several seconds, mesmerized 
                by the shining jewels. Then I heard a growl directly behind me. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I immediately dove to the side and came up ready for combat. The 
                biggest gnoll I'd ever seen was standing there. He was gripping 
                a large staff and was definitely not happy with me. He swung the 
                staff down in a powerful overhead smash. I raised my shield and 
                was jarred by the crushing impact. I staggered backwards, and 
                the gnoll jabbed the butt of the staff into my chest. I heard 
                a rib crack. I grimaced and countered with an axe swing. The blade 
                bit into his arm, but he seemed to ignore the pain. He brought 
                the staff around and parried my next blow. The unwieldy weapon 
                brought him slightly off balance, and I capitalized on the opportunity. 
                My booted foot swung up and hit him in his solar plexus. The gnoll 
                gasped and staggered back. A moment later, I relieved it of its 
                head. I sighed in relief and leaned up against the wall. <br>
                <br>
                Moments later, Styris rushed into the room, sword at ready. He 
                saw the guardsman corpse and something flashed through his eyes. 
                Then he smiled and helped me up. He clapped his hands onto my 
                shoulders and said, "Good job, Baratol. Well, it seems I am forced 
                to do it myself." I stared at him, confused. Then his hands glowed 
                a sickly black color, and I screamed as my flesh withered beneath 
                his hands. I tried to twist out of his grasp, but I found I had 
                no strength left. He released me and I slumped against the wall, 
                fading out of consciousness. I saw him turn to face the gnoll 
                who stood in the hallway. They exchanged a few words and the gnoll 
                handed Styris a jingling bag. Styris turned to me and showed a 
                grin full of teeth, and then I knew only blackness. <br>
                <br>
                I woke up in a dark, cramped room. I gritted my teeth as my shoulders 
                flared in intense pain. I was behind a sturdy oaken door with 
                bars set in it. I looked through the bars and saw into a small 
                room. Blood was splattered on the floor, and I realized I was 
                behind the door in the alcove. My equipment was piled on the table, 
                and a gnoll was picking through it. Pain surged through my body 
                and I groaned and collapsed to my knees. The gnoll came over and 
                peered through the bars at me. Then it gurgled and collapsed to 
                the floor. I dragged myself into the corner fearfully. I heard 
                a <em>click</em>, and the door swung open. A human woman dressed 
                in dirty leather peered in. She saw me, and backed away into the 
                hallway. I heard murmuring, and a man in bright chain mail stepped 
                into view. He kneeled down in the doorway and stared at me. "Not 
                a good place to be, my friend. Fear not, for we are friends," 
                he said. He reached out towards my shoulders. Instinctively, I 
                pulled away. "Do not worry. I am Koris Jarasin, a paladin of Rodcet 
                Nife. If I am to be able to heal your wounds, then ye must not 
                shy away." I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. He touched 
                my shoulders, and a soothing feeling rushed through me. I felt 
                my shoulders heal and my rib mend. I looked past him and saw the 
                dead gnoll with a well-crafted dagger sticking between its shoulder 
                blades. I struggled up and found my muscles were a bit sore, but 
                functional. Koris stood and smiled then stepped back. I retrieved 
                my gear and was relieved to find that none of my hard-earned equipment 
                was missing. <br>
                <br>
                Koris had come down with a group of his friends, and he invited 
                me join his party. The group consisted of three people: Koris, 
                the leader, Misal Bessin, the female thief I saw before, and Geron 
                Siffar, a cleric of Rodcet Nife. Already a formidable group, I 
                added my collection of skills and knowledge. <br>
                <br>
                When I informed Koris of how I came to be within the cell, his 
                eyes narrowed and a fury blazed with a religious intensity. "I 
                know of Styris Cormisen. He is a powerful Shadow Knight who has 
                made several deals with the denizens of this place, as well as 
                a few unsavory people I wish I did not know. He has often made 
                trouble within the city of Qeynos, and has murdered several people." 
                <br>
                <br>
                I replied, "If so, then why has he not been caught and killed." 
                <br>
                <br>
                Koris shook his head and said, "It seems he has become friends 
                with a few necromancers. Twice, when some guardsmen and I have 
                tried to apprehend the fiend, his allies have showed up. While 
                we were busy fending off the undead monstrosities, he made his 
                escape. We have also been unable to discern the location of his 
                dwelling." <br>
                <br>
                I nodded as I absorbed this new information. I thought for a moment 
                before speaking up again. "Well, I am willing to help find the 
                man. With my skills at tracking, I believe we would be able to 
                find him. I would welcome the chance to exact my revenge." <br>
                <br>
                Koris nodded and we all quickened our pace. "Very well, let us 
                make haste for the surface, and we shall see if we can follow 
                his trail." <br>
                <br>
                No sooner had we left BlackBurrow then we heard several panicked 
                cries. "Tovax! Tovax Vmar! He is nearing the cottage!" Koris growled, 
                "Now is the time to put the life of another villain to an end." 
                We all sprinted off in the direction of the cottage. <br>
                <br>
                We arrived in time to see Tovax walking into the hills, with three 
                animated corpses following. We all charged after him. I, having 
                a great agility, outdistanced my fellows and crested a hill moments 
                behind Tovax. I skidded to a stop. Styris stood not ten feet away, 
                talking to Tovax. He saw me and sneered. "Out of the rat trap 
                already? My, those gnolls are quite incompetent." Koris and the 
                rest of the party came up behind me, and Styris's eyes widened 
                a bit. "Oh, and here's the rest of the fun." Tovax spun and pointed 
                at the four of us. The three undead corpses shambled towards us. 
                With a prayer to Rodcet Nife, Koris leapt into the fray, rending 
                two of the abominations within seconds. Geron murmured the words 
                of a spell, and the last undead dissolved into dust. <br>
                <br>
                Misal tried to sneak behind Tovax for a vicious backstab, but 
                he saw her. "Foolish woman. Prepare for the next life!" He swung 
                his staff around with amazing speed, shattering Misal's arm. Next, 
                he cast a spell, and Misal paled a bit and dropped to the floor, 
                with strong poison running through her veins. Koris charged forwards, 
                drawing the necromancer's attention. I saw Styris trying to sneak 
                away out of the corner of my eye. "Ye shall not escape!" I shouted. 
                I drew an arrow and released. The shot was slightly off mark, 
                and did not strike his neck as I hoped. It dug into his shoulder. 
                He growled at me and snapped the shaft. He hurled an axe at me, 
                forcing me to duck out of the way. Then he sprinted off into the 
                night. <br>
                <br>
                "Baratol! Help me!" I spun around. Geron kneeled next to Misal, 
                tending her. Koris and Tovax were locked in combat. Tovax swung 
                his staff around and knocked Koris's knee out from under him. 
                In desperation, I threw my minotaur axe at Tovax. The blade fell 
                short, but it distracted Tovax. Koris swung his two-handed sword 
                and sliced Tovax's arm off at the elbow. He screamed in agony 
                and I dropped him with an arrow to the neck. <br>
                <br>
                We stay there for about half an hour, recuperating. Misal would 
                live, but would require more tending. Geron decided to stay behind, 
                leaving Koris and myself to hunt down Styris. We picked up our 
                weapons and headed off, following the blood trail caused by my 
                arrow. <br>
                <br>
                We followed the trail to the pass leading into the Plains of Karana. 
                Koris muttered to himself when we discovered this. I paused for 
                a moment, then caught the faint impression of his heavy boots 
                in the soft dirt. "Come," I said. "We can still follow him." We 
                traveled further through the pass. Nearing the exit, we came across 
                a mortally wounded teenage human male. He had a pair of grisly 
                slash wounds across his chest. I knelt down next to the lad and 
                examined his wounds. I looked up at Koris and shook my head. The 
                kid moaned and mumbled something. <br>
                <br>
                "What was that?" Koris asked. <br>
                <br>
                The youth whispered, "'Twas Styris again… he… he stormed by in 
                a rage." <br>
                <br>
                Koris reddened in anger. "Was it? Where can we find the brute?" 
                <br>
                <br>
                The youth looked up with pain filled eyes. He was fading fast. 
                "'He… his home is located a mile north of the marker… be w… wary… 
                of… of…" The youth dwindled and died. Koris snatched his sword 
                from his scabbard and charged away, enraged. I stood up and hurried 
                after him. <br>
                <br>
                We scrambled for only a few minutes before we come in sight of 
                a small cabin up ahead. Yellow light flickered out from within. 
                Koris roared and rushed forwards. He came within ten feet of the 
                door when suddenly several ghastly hands reached up from the dirt 
                and clutched his legs. He seemed not to notice, and hacked the 
                hands off. I saw a trickle of blood dripping down his pant leg. 
                Koris took two more steps and collapsed. I ran forward. I saw 
                more hands reach up for me, so I leapt with all my might and eluded 
                their grasp. Koris coughed and wretched, caught within the throes 
                of a violent seizure. The door swung open and a skeleton stood 
                in the threshold. I came up and swung my axe, shattering the skeleton 
                into shards of bone. "Must you make such a mess?" I looked at 
                Styris. He was sitting in the corner calmly replacing the bandage 
                on his shoulder. <br>
                <br>
                "I ought to kill you now," I snarled. <br>
                <br>
                He looked at me and sighed. "Oh please. What exactly do you think 
                you can do to me? My powers greatly exceed your pitiful skills." 
                I stepped forward and swung my axe at his head. He nimbly dodged 
                to the side and gripped his two-handed sword. His swing was more 
                powerful than mine, and when I blocked it with my shield the sturdy 
                wood splintered and cracked. Grimacing as the wood splinters dug 
                into my face, I lashed out with my foot. He knocked it away with 
                his hand, then deftly disarmed me. <br>
                <br>
                I grabbed my dagger and stumbled backwards away from the deadly 
                sword. His slashes were deceptively swift for a man and sword 
                of such great size. After vainly attempting to parry his blows, 
                I was slashed severely across the chest and arms. The hulking 
                man grinned and advanced towards me. There was a creak by the 
                door, and we both turned to look. Koris stood there, pale and 
                shaking, but furious. "Ye must use those vile abominations to 
                fight me and are too cowardly to face me alone! I challenge ye 
                to a duel!" <br>
                <br>
                Styris laughed. "Very well, come for your death when you are ready," 
                he said in a mocking tone. <br>
                <br>
                Koris turned to me, and said, "Leave. Now." <br>
                <br>
                I shook my head. "No, I'll not leave ye to him alone." <br>
                <br>
                His face flushed in anger. "LEAVE! If he should be able to best 
                me, what do ye think you could do? NOTHING!" He grabbed me by 
                my lapels and hoisted me up. "Leave now, and get help. If we both 
                fall, he shall continue to terrorize the people with impunity." 
                I grimaced, and nodded mutely. He threw me to the door, and I 
                stumbled out. I noticed several dozen pairs of hacked bony hands 
                lying about. Last I heard was the clash of swords. Even far away, 
                I could feel the light and dark powers colliding. Then I turned 
                and ran as fast as I could. <br>
                <br>
                I came back not one hour later. I had Misal and Geron marching 
                beside me, and a group of fifteen Qeynos guardsmen following behind 
                me. As we approached the small cottage, I motioned for the others 
                to stop, and I quietly crept ahead. There was a deathly silence. 
                I slowly stepped to the threshold and dreaded what I was about 
                to see. I carefully peered within. A pool of blood was on the 
                floor, a mixture of the life fluid of both combatants. Koris lay 
                on his back with Styris fallen on top. Styris had Koris's sword 
                protruding from his back, though I could not see the condition 
                of the noble paladin. I pushed the corpse of Styris aside and 
                kneeled besides Koris. He stirred. I shouted out, "Geron! Misal! 
                Get in here! He's still alive!" The two others rushed in. Geron 
                assessed the situation, and began casting a series of healing 
                spells. Within a few minutes, Koris was awake and fully restored. 
                Joyously, we made our way back to Qeynos with the sword of the 
                fallen Shadow Knight. <br>
                <br>
                Little did we know that this was not the last we had seen of Styris. 
                But then again, that is another story for another time</font>.
