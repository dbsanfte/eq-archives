              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                spending many, many hours in this notorious place slaying Orcs 
                by the hundreds and getting killed myself a lot as well I thought 
                I’d share some of my experiences with the rest of you.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                are two things about Crushbone that are most famous: trains and 
                crowds. I cannot remember how many times I was peacefully clobbering 
                Centurions and all of a sudden I have two emissaries and the Royal 
                Guard pounding me senseless. Oh great someone trained the castle 
                crew. Usually this gets followed by the nefarious D’Vinn going 
                on a rampage leaving a trail of bodies all over the place. It 
                has to be said though with the maturing of the servers, D’Vinn 
                is less of a threat these days. Usually there are a few higher 
                level players in the castle tower making sure D’Vinn gets sent 
                to the afterlife rather quickly. He is now camped as well since 
                he drops the Dragoon Dirk.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">But 
                I am getting ahead of things. The first time I went into Crushbone 
                I was about level 5. Some group members thought it would be a 
                good idea to head over there. It was dark and I reluctantly entered 
                the zone. The zone tunnel was in complete chaos there was a big 
                battle going on between a group of Centurions and a group of players. 
                We hurried past them and I promptly fell in a moat of some sorts. 
                I swam around for a while, noticed a ladder and climbed out of 
                the water to be greeted by a big Centurion who was entirely unimpressed 
                by my wet Ranger clutching a rusty sword and proceeded to pummel 
                me into the ground. However my group members found me and we killed 
                the creature. I limped back to the zone and surveyed the corpses 
                until some more Centurions showed up and I had to zone in a hurry.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">On 
                a good day, Crushbone is full of Orcs to annihilate. In a good 
                group of people around level 6 you can do well in the open area 
                directly after the zone. Many Centurions are there and if you 
                are careful you can have a blast. They give good experience and 
                drop decent loot sometimes from cloth armour to cracked staffs 
                that sell for about 9 gold. When you advance in levels you can 
                head deeper in to the slaver cave or the camp with the Legionnaires. 
                And if you are in your teens you can venture into the castle and 
                fight the Legionnaires there plus the rest of the castle crew 
                providing you have a good group going.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">On 
                a bad day, Crushbone will be overcrowded, people will be stealing 
                kills (many kill steal arguments have taken place on the trainer 
                hill) and rampant trains will soon make you want to leave. An 
                incompetent crew in the castle will probably cause Emperor Crush, 
                the Prophet, the Royal Guard and the ever charming Ambassador 
                D’Vinn to come chasing them back to the zone, causing general 
                mayhem and death to the unwary.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                are six general areas in Crushbone, I will describe them one at 
                a time:</font></p>
              <dir> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">1)&#9;The 
                  Centurion grounds</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">A 
                slightly pretentious name for lack of a better one. Basically 
                this is the area directly after the zone including the zone tunnel 
                itself. Great area for those around level 6. There are a few places 
                inside the zone tunnel where Centurions and Pawns appear. They 
                usually get killed by people that are resting there. The foolish 
                Orcs will attack anybody who is sitting down even if they are 
                many levels above them.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Just 
                outside the tunnel there is an area tapering off to a point with 
                a small bridge leading to some debris and not much else. In this 
                area a few Centurions appear and there are three Centurions guarding 
                the bridge. To the left just after the zone tunnel is another 
                bridge guarded by two Centurions and the area after the bridge 
                up to the rocky steps leading up also has a few Centurions in 
                it.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">To 
                the right after the zone tunnel is a narrower path leading around 
                the trainer hill up to the castle. This is the usual train route 
                and leads to the more dangerous area in front of the castle. The 
                legionnaires there will be too much to handle if you’re below 
                10 at least.</font></p>
              <dir> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">2)&#9;The 
                  trainer hill</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                is the hill in front and to the right of the zone tunnel. On top 
                of this hill is a circular area with a cooking pot in the middle. 
                The Orc trainer appears here, surrounded by a group of Centurions. 
                The trainer sometimes drops the shiny brass shield. In the older 
                days and on younger servers this was and is a highly coveted item 
                due to its magical resistance bonus. So there are always people 
                waiting for the trainer to appear so they can kill him hoping 
                to get the shield. Sometimes people walk in and take the kill 
                from others leading to nasty arguments and general stress that 
                you usually try to avoid while playing a game for fun. Once when 
                unable to sleep at night I logged into EQ at 3am PST and the zone 
                had three people in it. &quot;Great&quot; I thought and headed 
                for the hill. Alas the only three people in the zone were camping 
                the trainer. I shrugged and left. Never got one of those shiny 
                shields and since I’m dual wielding now I never will. They sell 
                for about 10pp these days on Solusek Ro. I think the trainer is 
                around level 8 or so. Since about four Centurions appear on the 
                hill around the trainer you need a group or some kind of understanding 
                with whoever else is after the shield to take care of them and 
                take turns fighting the trainer or something.</font></p>
              <dir> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">3)&#9;The 
                  slaver caves</font></p>
              </dir>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                crossing the bridge to the left after the zone and crossing the 
                small open area you can go up a small hill. When you get to the 
                top you can see two small buildings and a cave across from them. 
                The area around the buildings is filled with Centurions. There 
                is also one Legionnaire that appears there now and then. I have 
                seen him directly left of the hill or in the first mouth of the 
                cave.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                largest of the two buildings contains a slaver and three slaves 
                that are part of the Screaming Mace quest. The slaver is roughly 
                the level of a Legionnaire. Sometimes the slavers drop keys that 
                can be used to free slaves. Give a copper to a slave and they 
                will tell you which key they need. Give them the correct key and 
                they will be freed and give you some money and good faction hits. 
                There is a system to the keys but it would be a bit too much to 
                explain that here. I’ll leave that up to you to find out.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Inside 
                the cave are two more slavers and the highly annoying Rondo Dunfire. 
                Well lethal if you’re not prepared. Many people who have ventured 
                into this cave have come out running and yelling ‘train!’ with 
                two slavers and Dunfire in tow (backstabbing them all the way). 
                If they make it to the zone they will have picked up every Centurion 
                on the way and chaos ensues. Needless to say be prepared when 
                you enter that cave. Have a good group or a decent level so you 
                can take the two slavers and Dunfire. Rondo drops his tongue which 
                is part of a quest from Kaladim. His brothers and sister can be 
                found in the Butcherblock mountains.</font></p>

              </dir>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">When 
                you pass by the slaver caves you go uphill a bit and soon enter 
                a camp. There are lots of tents, most of them with Orcs inside 
                them. Lots of Centurions and a few Legionnaires live there. There 
                is also a cave off to the side that connects this area to the 
                slaver caves area. It exits left of the house across a small bridge. 
                Inside this tunnel are a few Centurions and a Legionnaire sometimes 
                appears as well. I have seen many bodies in or around this tunnel, 
                when you are fighting Centurions and the Legionnaire shows up 
                you’re in trouble. Be wary.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">At 
                the other side of the camp you will get to a narrow path that 
                follows the castle moat on one side and a wall on the other. In 
                the corner where the path starts a Legionnaire sometimes appears. 
                The path will lead around the castle to the front entrance. That 
                area can be dangerous since people often pull things from inside 
                the castle to fight outside since it’s a bit safer but when more 
                people are there it can get pretty chaotic and when Crush or D’Vinn 
                decide to join the fray bodies start littering the place.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">When 
                you enter the zone and head right following the path that curves 
                around the trainer hill and follow the wall on the right side 
                (the left hand side is the usual path for castle trains) you will 
                enter an area that opens up a bit to the right. That corner is 
                actually quite safe to sit for a bit and meditate or nurse your 
                wounds. There are a few pits there with slaves in them. If you 
                killed slavers and got keys take a moment to free these pitiful 
                dwarves and elves. At the back of this area is another cooking 
                pot and two slavers appear there. There are also the obligatory 
                Centurions of course.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Down 
                in the pit to the back is a poor Gnome by the name of Hap Dremblenod. 
                He has a pet and can be freed as well with a key. Once did I see 
                him and his pet running around, someone must have actually attacked 
                him. He’s a wizard and his fire elemental pet is pretty tough 
                around lvl16 or so. So free the little guy, don’t try to kill

                there is a room full of Legionnaires, Oracles and Emissaries to 
                get past first.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Before 
                entering the castle you can explore the courtyard a bit. There 
                are some Legionnaires, the occasional Oracle and the very elusive 
                Warlord to be found there. Take care with the Oracles. Not only 
                do they have the nasty habit of healing other Orcs (very unsettling 
                when the Legionnaire you’re fighting is getting healed) but they 
                can also root you. This means you can’t move and if you get in 
                trouble you’re pretty much dead.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Warlord is actually the most sought after creature in Crushbone. 
                Not only is he very rare he also carries the still very highly 
                valued Bracers of Battle. These are not only a fine pair of bracers 
                (nice stat bonuses) but also part of the Screaming Mace quest. 
                People are still very much after these things, they sell well. 
                This means the Warlord’s life span is about as long as a snowball’s 
                in a firestorm. He’s about level 16. I actually bumped into him 
                once and killed him. No bracers but he did drop a bronze weapon. 
                Every once in a while when not doing much else I venture in to 
                Crushbone just to see if I get lucky again and pick the guy up 
                on tracking. But it is very much a question of luck. He appears 
                at 45 minute intervals (so I have heard) and at various places 
                around the castle.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
                you open the door to the castle and walk down the hallway you’ve 
                entered the toughest part of Crushbone. Also sadly enough the 
                most camped part these days. People will be sitting in an empty 
                throne rooms and any Orc that appears will be blasted to smithereens 
                in no time. If you are lucky and find it relatively empty it can 
                be a great place for those in their mid-teens. Legionnaires appear 
                throughout the whole area. Once inside there is a table at one 
                end and a throne at the other. Behind the table an Oracle appears, 
                emissaries and another oracle appear throughout the throne room. 
                In front of the throne itself Lord Darish and an exceptionally 
                tough Legionnaire appear in turns. Darish is still wanted for 
                the Dwarven axes he sometimes drops. The 1h dwarven axe is a good 
                weapon and the 2 hander rarer and also pretty good. Sometimes 
                I have walked into the throne room to find it devoid of players 
                and full of Orcs. In this situation it is hard to clear it out 
                because fighting one pretty much means fighting them all. At lvl22 
                I can fight in the back and most others will ignore me but at 
                lower levels the whole room will happily join the fight. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Behind 
                the throne is a stairway leading up to the tower. In the middle 
                of this stairway the Royal Guard appears. He is about lvl17 and 
                does some nasty backstabbing. He also drops bronze weapons. In 
                the tower room itself The Prophet, Emperor Crush and Ambassador 
                D’Vinn appear. The Prophet is a spell caster a bit like a tougher 
                version of an Oracle. He drops Thergon’s Spellbook, a lore item 
                that is part of an Ak’Anon quest. Crush himself is about lvl20 
                and sometimes drops a Dwarven Ringmail tunic. A perfect item for 
                a mid-teens wood elf or other small race. Still pretty much in 
                fashion but I have seen them sell for little or even given away 
                by generous higher level players.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Finally 
                there is D’Vinn. The infamous dark elf Ambassador. He appears 
                in the castle room right next to Crush. Sometimes a Centurion 
                appears in his place and when this Centurion gets killed chances 
                are D’Vinn will make an appearance next. Now D’Vinn is one of 
                those creatures that cons way lower than he actually is. At lvl22 
                he cons low blue to me (that means he is about lvl20) but I will 
                definitely lose the fight. I know of lvl20 casters that can solo 
                him so it’s a matter of who you are. A good group of high teens 
                should be able to handle him. The fact that he is fast, hits very 
                hard and attacks anyone makes him particularly nasty. Many times 
                you will hear shouts about D’Vinn being out or being trained to 
                the zone. At that moment it is best to make a quick exit, cast 
                camo/invis or find a safe spot if you are too inexperienced to 
                handle him. After he started dropping the Dragoon Dirk he has 
                become a target for higher level players wanting this weapon. 
                It is still the weapon of choice for many rogues and dual-wielding 
                fighters.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">One 
                popular escape route from the castle is to jump out of the windows. 
                Your pursuers may or may not follow depending on other available 
                victims. But it’s faster than darting through the sometimes crowded 
                hallway picking up a few Legionnaires in the process. If you are 
                a good swimmer you could jump into the moat and swim right towards 
                the back of the slaver cave, there is an entrance from the water 
                there. Orcs do swim however and I have seen poor souls swimming 
                frantically around the moat with several Orcs in pursuit. I have 
                heard of people being rooted under water and dying a miserable 
                drowning death. So be careful is all I can say.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                are several quests concerning Crushbone:</font></p>

                <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">First 
                  of all there is the screaming mace. It is a fairly involved 
                  quest that has you collecting the Bracers of Battle and Crush’s 
                  Tunic. Talk to the slaves inside the house by the slaver cave 
                  and you’re on your way.</font></li>
                <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Centurions 
                  will drop Crushbone belts and Legionnaires will drop Legionnaire 
                  shoulder pads. These can be taken to a Dwarf named Canloe Nusbeck 
                  in Kaladim who will reward you pretty well for them.</font></li>
                <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                  is a merchant in Kelethin (forgot her name right now) who will 
                  make a Banded Orc vest in exchange for a crushbone belt, a pair 
                  of Legionnaire shoulder pads and 10gp. These are decent pieces 
                  of armour since they protect you from disease and they look 
                  black on you for that spiffy fashion statement. They do drop 
                  your charisma by 5 however and only elves can wear them.</font></li>

              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                this long story I guess all is left to say that Crushbone is a 
                good zone for those between levels 6 and 20. After 20 it gets 
                a bit stale and there are way better places to hang out at that 
                point. I alternated Crushbone with Butcherblock in my low teens 
                and did several long and fulfilling trips to Antonica in my higher 
                teens. It gets tiring after a while killing Orc upon Orc and dealing 
                with the maddening trains. Not to mention the crowded circumstances 
                sometimes. But I have had great times in there in good groups 
                raking in the experience and returning home to deposit good money 
                in my bank account.</font></p>
