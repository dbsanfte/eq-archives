  </tr></table>Allow me to throw my 2CP in here, Ladies, and Gentlemen...<br><br><br>I am still discussing this with Gaunja, but this is my point by point plan on making the guild succeed, and please put your trust in my words because I amseeing this in action on another server even as I type this. <br><br>To Start off...Those of you who are Pre-55s need to start grouping in Plane of Justice.<br>There is NO Better exp than Planes of Power. It's as simple as that.<br>Once you guys are 55ish, a BUNCH of doors will open. Let me ellaborate on the battle plan during thenext few months.<br><br>A: The Halo of Chaos tag and the Chaos and Destruction Tag are, for the most part, Tarnished on Tallon Zek. It's not by fault of one or many, but an unfortunate side-effect of the fierce rivalry on our server.<br>Therefore: A new guildtag will be voted upon in the next few weeks.<br><br>B: Leadership will go through some changes, with Officers being assigned special duties, so that not all officers recruit, and not all officers are to plan raids. <br><br>C: An Application proccess will come into effect, so that we can root out the good from the bad. Although many of you loyal guildies apped and got accepted and are still here, there are many people who will just join and leave for no reason, and we want to maket his a QUALITY guild, not just for us, but for all of you.<br><br>D: Active grouping: Guys, As a Magician, let me tell you no one appreciates Soloing more than I.<br>However,<br>Exp in PoP is so good that it's better to group than to NOT group. We will begin to organize lots of groups, so that we take over PoJ pretty much until we are all at least lvl 55 or so.<br><br>Now, those were the plans for the guild to grow. <br>Here are the plans for the guild to RAID :-p<br><br>A: Start off Raiding in Umbral Plains. It's a great spot to get to know what Raid encounters are like. It will give everyone a prime opportunity to start to get to know their class's role in a raid and also get some decent loot.<br><br><br>B: Start Raiding Kael. Akui's post was what really made me post this whole thing. Kael may seem dumb, but you have to look at the long run.<br>With Kael, comes good CoV Faction. With Good CoV faction, after a month or two, we could start doing HoT, and THEN we are going to be KNEE DEEP in LOOT.<br>We have to start off small and progress. That's how all the other guilds did, even Pande. And that's how we will work it out. Kael may not be the funnest of places, but you get the faction needed, and you get the experience(Not EXP, but just in general, knowledge) of indoor raiding. Plus some decent quest items drop once in a while.<br><br>C: Once we have an active force that is raid-capable of at least 24 people, we can start doing SOME Epic mobs like Venril Sathir, and Planar raids like the new Hate (its fun) and the rest of the pre-PoP zones.<br>By about this point, we should all be in the 55-60ish range<br>If we get this far, we'll be about on Par with SotG.<br><br>D: Once we have enough time spent doing all these things, and once we get an active roster of about 30 people for raids, we can start doing that which I mentioned a lil while ago, which is HoT(Halls of Testing) Dragons, giant creatures, ok exp, GREAT loot.<br>After a month or two of doing HoT, ( and collecting some Sleeper Tomb Keys ), we should have a raid force of about 35-40, and we can start inching our way into Sleeper's tomb.<br><br>E: After we get a raid force of about 60 active members lvls 55+, we can start actually doing Sleepers Tomb. <br>And let me explain something, with Sleepers Tomb, we will be very very very powerful. It's not just any guild that can make it in there. But if you guys take it seriously, stick to the guild, and follow this plan, this guild will be doing ST by about November. <br><br>Now, I know this seems far away, but what else are you going to do? Level up to 61, Bend over, and let Pande/Disc/Indig stick it in you and make you their bitch?<br>Guys we can do it without them. We can be a big guild and still not have to rely on the help or alliances of these other guys.<br>If we get HoT ready, Epics will be a breeze. Just stick to it.<br><br>More will be posted as decisions are made.

Truth be told, Officership isn't a promotion, it's an enforced responsibility.<br>Officers are nothing more than people that have to answer for a lot of people, and that's how Leaders are as well, except we make the final calls on things.<br><br>At one point, I had thought that the way to make the guild work was to swell it with membership and get everyone to show up.<br>That's not how it works :-)<br>The most important thing right now isn't recruiting members, it's leveling up and getting to know your class.<br>If I get back on Tallon on July 11th, and I find at LEAST 18 ACTIVE members who are at LEAST 49+ (if you're not, it's ok, but 49+ is what we're aiming for), then we could TOTALLY be a guild to be reckonned with. <br>All everyone has to do is get it into your minds that this guild isn't going to work without the special attention of each and everyone of you. You all have to be reliable to show up/notify us if you can't on raids. You all have to be reliable not to fight with one another.<br>You all have to be reliable enough to say to yourselves "OK, I may not get as good exp by grouping with soandso, but it will help the guild in the long run" <br>Get to KNOW each other.<br>After I get back, and after Gaunja Levels up his cleric (The idiot turned down an offer to have a 52 cleric for free), we will make a decision.<br><br>Either this guild moves forward, or this guild dissapears and we give up. <br>I have spent 9 months working on 2 different guilds with all my time and effort. I don't feel like giving up. I don't think, I KNOW we can make it if we could just get the levels and participation we need.<br>ONE DAY in Kael arena and we'll be a WAY better guild than we are now.<br>JUST ONE DAY<br>All I ask of you all is that when I get back I can expect ONE DAY a week from you all to show up. <br>And when the guild starts moving again as it should be, with me and Gaunja back in full swing, THEN some more officers will be appointed.<br><br><br>All this stupid rant boils down to is this:<br>If you want to be an officer, understand the responsibilities that come with it, accept them, and start showing that you're capable BEFORE you get the promotion.<br>Get some gruops going in PoJ/PoD/Kael...work on CoV faction in Kael, level up in PoJ, do some group sin Seb...<br>If I get back and I see someone took the initiative and started getting the guild working, they will be an Officer, and they will be of the highest standing in the guild.<br><br>Goodluck to you all while I'm on leave to Stormhammer.

  </tr></table>Hey guys.<br><br>I have recently moved to the Stormhammer(Legends) server. I did it this past Sunday. Don't worry, for those of you who may care( :-p ), I WILL be back by June 11th on my next billing cycle.<br>I just went to Stormhammer to have a better chance to get to know lvling/raiding spots in zones that I would otherwise not have too much access at on our server.<br><br>I do have some suggestions to help out the guild:<br>Verant has done us a HUGE favor by making the Planes of Power Expansion.<br>For those of us, lvl 53+, there is NO better experience than a good, well rounded exp group in the Planes.<br><br>For those of you who are 46-52, I would suggest you guys regularly do Plane of Justice groups by the zoneline. There is Great EXP There. Another good spot in PoJ is in the basement. If anyone wants me to lead them to these spots post it on this board and I'll show you on a mule I have on Tallon.<br><br>For those of you 53+, I have found that a well rounded group that includes at LEAST a upper 50s Tank, an upper 50s healer, and a 58+ enchanter/Shaman will give you GREAT exp in PoD by the Left side of the Castle. You can also do smaller exp groups by kyting in PoN. <br>There are GREAT places to EXP in PoP. Don't be afraid of the other PK guilds. Just find a little niche and level up. Hopefully, by this time next month, we'll all be in our upper 50s, low 60s. :-)

  </tr></table>Disclaimer:<br>These rules can change at any moment and I am authorized to put them into full effect as of any changes.<br>They are to be kept sacred, and followed word for word.<br><br>These rules are going to be Categorized. If you are looking for the different categories, they will be CAPPED for ease of browsing. <br><br>PUBLIC RELATIONS:<br><br>Remember, you are all representatives of the guild as a whole. Act mature in all the things you do. Don't Gloat at people, don't talk smack to people. If you PK, that's fine. Just don't gloat like a bloke.<br><br>NO ONE is an official representative of the guild on inter-guild relations, except for Gaunja and Myself. Any questions/comments related to alliances/pacts/lack thereof, should be noted, and <a href="forum.php?new=leadership">posted on the LEADERS board</a> for revew by me and Gaunja. Officers will, of course, do their job of answering for our guildies and answering general questions about the guild and telling people about our guild, but as far as detailistic discussions between powers, that belongs soley to the leadership. <br><br><br>PLAYER KILLING (PKing):<br><br>Chaos and Destruction currently are non-alligned.<br>We have no allies, and no one likes us very much. I don't wanna say we are KOS to anyone, because that all boils down to your personal views on the matter. You don't HAVE to kill someone who isn't in Chaos, but then again, it's always best to get the jump on someone before they get the jump on you.<br><br>Rules regarding Chaos:<br><br>PK anyone you want. Just don't be too unfair to people by overwhelming them in numbers.<br><br>Avoid EXP Killing. We may be Chaos, but we aren't bastards. If you feel it neccessary, do it. But avoid it at all costs. <br><br>CCing is ok IF they have been bastards.<br>Bind Camping is Illegal as per EQ rules. Any Bind Camping is not sponsored by the guild.<br><br>**************Fighting Other Guild Members:<br>There is to be NO In Fighting. Not even if you're joking. The only way, and I mean the ONLY way, is if you both decide to duel and /d each other.<br><br><br>RECRUITING:<br>Do NOT Recruit anyone of 39th or lower lvl. <br>I would rather say 46 or lower, but then again, it's too early to make that restriction on all classes.<br>Therefore:<br>Clerics, Enchanters, and Warriors of lvl 39+ are welcome to Join.<br>All other classes must be 46+ from now on. <br><br>Very soon, an application process will come into full effect. So try not to let just anyone join.<br>Make sure the person you're inviting is ready for the responsibility of showing up for raids or at the very least notifying us if they CANNOT show up. Make sure they are willing to help the guild and interact with us. <br><br><br>ATTENDANCE and RAIDING:<br>Attendance is MANDATORY for ALL Raids UNLESS you post on the LEADERSHIP board at the VERY LEAST 3 days before a planned raid. <br>First Breach of this rule will be a verbal warning.<br>Second Breach will result in Demotion and/or temporary loss of looting privelages.<br>Third Breach will result in expulsion from guild and permanent KOS status. <br><br>Don't take this offensively, but There is NO Excuse for NOT informing us that you can't make it on a pre-scheduled raid. <br><br><br>INTERNAL ISSUES:<br><br>For any Internal Scuffles:<br><br>1. All problems within the guild shall be brought the the attention of an officer.<br>2. All problems within the guild involving Officers as well shall be brought to the Leadership.<br><br>Leadership(to my knowledge) currently consists of:<br><a href="profile.php?id=18">Gaunja</a><br><a href="profile.php?id=20">Magijedi</a><br><br>Officers are there to administrate for, and aid, the leadership.<br><br>3. ALL problems within the guild, no matter who it involves, is to be kept in TELLS.<br>If any of you have a problem with one another, you can either send Officers/Leadership a tell, OR post it on the Leadership board. <br><br>The <a href="forum.php?board=leadership">Leadership board</a> is a private board that can only be viewed by me and Gaunja and we can view any personal/private problems you may have. <br><br>I will NOT allow any fighting in guild chat. That's not what it's there for. That's not what the GUILD is there for. <br>I will issue a warning on the first incident.<br>Any further incidents I see will result in a vote by Leadership on suspension.<br>In all cases submitted for Review to Leadership, a Judgement SHALL be made and Penalties will incur. So think clearly before making a big deal out of something small. <br> <br>LOOTING:<br>We will be Raiding much more in the next few months, and this is an important issue.<br>If you want to Loot, You have to attend. <br>We aren't using a Raid Point system, per say...<br>Looting will be decided on the fly by me or Gaunja. During unofficial raids/groups, looting will go to the roll.<br>Key rules for Unofficial raids: NEED B4 GREED.<br>If you have a Crystalline robe and another has an oracle robe(Old school comparrison I know) and an advisor robe drops, give the one with the oracle robe the advisor robe. That kinda thing.<br><br>If you want to get the loots and you want to get the epic pieces and you want to get the quest drops and you want to get the plat drops, SHOW UP FOR MORE RAIDS. Me and Jon are going to keep tabs on participation and interaction within the guild and that is how it will be decided. <br><br>Don't worry, those of you who remember how it was in Halo of Chaos when I was the leader, they can attest to the fact that I am 100% Fair in my loot decisions and assign it as needed/deserved. <br>Everything will be spread equally. <br>By this time next month, some of us COULD(Keyword) be walking around with +10 or more to all stat items. COULD COULD COULD!!!<br>IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU!!!!<br>AHHHHAHAHAHAHAHA <br>Ok end of Rules Section.<br>Thanks all. <br>May Chaos Reign Supreme.
