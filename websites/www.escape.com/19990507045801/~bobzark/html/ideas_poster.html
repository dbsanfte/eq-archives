<P>by Bob
Z</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">One of the first laws Adolph Hitler
passed when he came to power in 1930s&nbsp; Germany was to outlaw street postering and
handbilling.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">Inevitably, in today's
intolerant and backward political climate, somebody's going to poster some public area
somewhere in this country, then get busted for it.&nbsp; It's for these people this
article is written.&nbsp; </FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">You CAN
Fight and win in the courts against postering fines.&nbsp; I know, because I personally
went to the trouble of fighting a very large fine of this sort, almost certainly larger
than any fine you're going to get.&nbsp; I took this battle to the highest court in New
York State, and with the help of the ACLU and the underground music community, won a
landmark decision.&nbsp; The vague statute then being twisted around by local
prosecutors was thrown out on constitutional grounds.&nbsp; </FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">
This means that there is a legal precedent now on the
books which states that you cannot be fined if your name appears on a flyer or poster
found on city property.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">
Usually, the
authorities try to claim that postering is &quot;garbage&quot; and that it's an eyesore
or a 'quality of life issue' and blah blah blah.&nbsp; Forget the free exchange of
information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never mind that postering has traditionally been an important
means of information exchange in democracies.&nbsp; If the local authorities say your
information is &quot;garbage&quot; and decide to fine you for posting it, you're going
to pay up.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; WRONG.</FONT><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino"><H3>WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE FINED NOW, IN 1999:</H3></FONT><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">We have heard of instances (in New York City, anyway), where "Poster Police" are AT IT AGAIN.
Recently they have been targeting clubs.  Most often, the clubs have their names on a flyer...
the cops give the fine to the club.  What does the idiot at the club do?  Turns around and tells the band
THEY have to pay the fine, or risk never being booked at the club again.  We recommend to bands
finding themselves in this situation to advise the club that legally they can and should fight their fine.  
Nobody, even the assholes who own clubs should pay a fine of this kind, particularly if</FONT><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">1. The ticket or the violation cites the administrative law statutes 10-119 or
10-126.  Enforcement of these statutes in particular was struck down as
unconstitutional in New York State appellate court in 1992, in the case <i>Bob Z
vs. Environmental Control Board</i>.  In a unanimous decision, the judges ruled that
enforcement of these statutes has "a chilling effect on the first amendment." 
Anyone fined under these statutes, and that includes nearly everyone who gets
fined (in New York) for postering, can and should use this decision to strike
down their fines in court.  People in other areas of the U.S. can also use this
case as precedent to help them fight.  Because of the ruling on the first
amendment, which is a fundamental right guaranteed under the constitution, citing
this case could get your fines dismissed no matter where in the U.S. you are.</FONT><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">2. The ticket may be faulty in any number of ways.  Demand that the club show you the
ticket... you can help them to fight the fine.  There is no reason why either you
or the club should be railroaded into paying such fines.  The city hasn't a legal leg
to stand on.  If you challenge them in court, and cite this case as precedent, chances
are excellent you will win.  Beware of administrative court (first
level of legal recourse in new york city is always in their administrative court,
where you very well could get railroaded no matter what you say or do); you are more likely to
get a fair hearing in a real (i.e., New York State Supreme Court is the first level) courtoom.</FONT><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">3. Remember that the law says that all tickets must be signed and handed to the defendant IN PERSON.
If this is not done (this is called process serving), then the court will throw out your tickets everytime.
NEVER, EVER answer the door if you think a cop or anyone is there to "serve you" with tickets.</FONT><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">In 1987, I was busted for flyering in New York City by a 1984-style
squad of &quot;Poster Police&quot;. At the time, Mayor Kroch and his irresponsible
cronie, then commissioner of Sanitation, Brendan Sexton, had put together a scam to lift hundreds of thousands in postering fines from an unsuspecting population.
Their targets? Immigrants and small businesspeople who had no idea they could be fined
for postering on public property.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">Every month, this goon squad of 6 fat &quot;Sanitcops&quot;, rejects who
couldn't possibly hope to become real cops, patrolled the city looking at lampposts and
phone poles, jotting down the locations and names on street flyers. Scamming lawyers at
Mayor Kroch's office figured out a loophole in the local statutes whereby this goon
squad could simply look at a name on a poster and then go after that person and fine
them for it. They decided to levy fines of $50 to $100 for EVERY single poster they
found. In some cases they would find hundreds of flyers with a single person's name on
them. People like these would get fines that exceeded their annual
income.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">With all the corruption in
the New York city government, and with the backing of powerful special interest groups
like the publisher of local yuppie community newspaper OUR TOWN (who sought to outlaw
street flyering so that people would be forced to buy more ads in his paper), this scam
carried on for years. Immigrants who were afraid of being deported and small
businesspeople who were ignorant of the law got fined anywhere from $50 to $10,000, and
more. Every month the city raked in from $20,000 to $100,000 in fines. If they tried to
resist, people were railroaded through administrative courts controlled by the
Sanitation Department, where people's prosecutors were also their judges. </FONT>

<BR><BR><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">I was fined $3,700 for posters they found with
the name Bob Z on them in 74 locations throughout New York City, posters that announced
a poetry reading and an underground punk rock show. Whether or not I posted them didn't
matter - my name was on them, they said, so I was liable. 5 Sanitcops showed up at my
door (I didn't know then that I never should have answered the door) after trying 5
times to find me. The law said that they had to serve me these tickets in person. They
stood on my stairs for an hour writing out 74 tickets.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">In order to fight this, I shouted long and loud to
anyone who would listen.&nbsp; I contacted a half dozen local politicians, one of whom
actually showed up at one of our street demonstrations. I got articles placed in every
newspaper I could find. All the major dailies eventually did stories.&nbsp; I held
meetings and organized others who had been similarly fined.&nbsp; We demonstrated
several times and picketed the street in front of the Sanitation Headquarters
Office.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went on TV and radio. In short, for 4 years I was compelled to
become an activist on this issue. Maybe I wouldn't have if some moron at the Sanitation
Department hadn't decided to trump up fines totalling over $22,000. But that's exactly
what they did. Every couple weeks I would get an 8-inch thick stack of tickets from the
Sanitation Department saying that I owed them over 20 thousand
dollars.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">At the time there were well
known people involved in anti-censorship struggles of their own, notably Jello Biafra
and Allen Ginsberg. These people&nbsp; heard about what happened and decided to help.
Particularly helpful were the lawyers Ginsberg had at the time.&nbsp; These were experts
in free speech issues who really knew the case law.&nbsp; I managed to convince one of
them to defend me, and by 1993, we won a complete victory in the New York State
Appellate Court.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">It took 4 years but
eventually all of my fines were struck down.&nbsp; The court ruled that the city was NOT
entitled to exact a fine just because handbills containing my name were found affixed to
city property. The entire Sanitgoon scam was undone by this decision. The City, the
Kroch Administration, and Sanit Comissioner Brendan Sexton were summarily defeated and
embarrassed.&nbsp; It's not often you see an entire municipal legal team with virtually
unlimited resources get beaten by a lone working stiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 6 Sanit Police
Poster Cops were put out of their jobs, and the city was compelled to &quot;cease and
desist&quot; their big &quot;poster sting.&quot;</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">What this means for others is that you CANNOT be fined for postering
anywhere unless you are actually, physically seen and caught in the act of affixing the
poster to public property. If you are fined without being seen, the law says that you
should not be fined.&nbsp; This case (New York City vs. Bob Z, 1993 ) is a legal
precedent that can and should be cited in your defense, to protect your right to create
a handbill or poster, free from authoritarian harassment.</FONT></P><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">A recent (March, 1998) New York Times article tried to
stir up public opinion in favor of reviving poster police, even though the communities
don't want that and the courts have clearly rendered such prosecution
unconstitutional.&nbsp; The NY Times, like the yuppie paper Our Town, has demonstrated
its intent to drive posters off the streets, thus forcing more people to advertise in
their paper.</FONT></P><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">In Giuliani time,&nbsp;
with all the increased police brutality in New York City, why shouldn't there be poster
police attacking people as well.&nbsp; Now there are currently 3 fulltime poster lackeys
back on the beat, and the top lackey heading this fearsome force is the very same
penguinesque anti-postering zealot and donut woofer John McGrath, who deemed it his
duty&nbsp; to make undercover calls to my house in 1988.&nbsp; Don't you feel safer
they're out there?&nbsp; I know I do.</FONT></TD>
