by R. Langston Zark<BR>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I don't agree that glamor and earthy honesty stand diametrically opposed; I'm an
idealist; liars and cowards revising the 60s can't face the facts; capitalism will
crumble eventually, just as communism did... and that's OK.  Future generations
will find new and better ways.  Contrary to what today's powerbrokers want everyone
to believe, the current economic and political order will eventually disappear and
be replaced by something else.  There's nothing particularly indestructible about
democracy or capitalism, and that's OK, it ain't worth saving anyway.<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The message of the 90s is that there is no message.  Shadows of murdered leaders of
the left still loom.  The Kennedys, King, Lennon, Malcolm X, the great dead rock
stars and countercultural icons still leave a void, a gaping hole light years wide.
 Bands of charismatic rightwing powerbrokers have been effectively filling this
void. A void created by assassins bullets.   In the late 80s and especially in the
90s, the 'newt right' has succeeded in grabbing hold of the media and manipulating
the masses, solidifying their position as a trendsetting cultural elite.  Utterly
transparent, the forces of the newt right have attempted to shove down our throats
fallacies cloaked in hypocritical family values and moral decency, all driven by
the alcohol and tobacco soaked bucks of big business.  Their success has yielded the
cultural stagnation and swampy backwater stillness that is the hallmark of this
decade.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../assets/images/takesthecakeA.gif" border=0 ALIGN=CENTER></CENTER><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Too few of us seem to question the commonly held notions of success - what is
success?  How is it measured?  By wealth?  Power?  Happiness?  Collective notions
of any kind have a hard time emerging from the incessant meaningless din that
chokes today's airwaves.  Big business purveys its wares through carefully packaged
image and style; the relentless competition for consumer dollars is a great secular
obsession of this era.<BR><BR>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>Why is this?  We seem to lack a coherent collective voice; everyone talks at once
but nobody says anything.  At least, nothing that sticks in our memories.  The MTV
generation knows how to pose with cigarettes, butt doesn't know how to listen; it's
true 'X' has a short attention span, but then, why pay attention?  What has "X" got
to listen to?  Superficial ads that insult human intelligence scream from the sides of
busses, from on top of taxicabs, across giant computerized neon billboards, on
every TV set, on every radio. What has "X" got to look forward to?  Everything has
been done before, done to death, and done much better.  It's no use trying to do
anything.  Why bother?<BR><BR>




<P ALIGN=LEFT>Todays adults put too much emphasis on belonging and fitting in.  Being a 'team
player' really means giving up your individuality and identity.  It's a concept
with roots in stalinism and fascism - the individual doesn't matter, all that
matters is an abstract, collective good.  Who really benefits from this abstract,
collective good?  Why, the owner of the corporation of course, the big boss who
collects the profits, the one who sits back and decides who will get the tablescraps after
he gets back from his Riviera vacation.<BR><BR>



<P ALIGN=LEFT>This generations response to oppression?  If not apathy, then
ineffective whining and complaining.  Instead of banding together and organizing,
which is the only real way for the masses to oppose any oligarchy, today's hip and
happening Xers refuse to look at the social and political concerns which have them
trapped.  Most remain separated into narrowly defined cliques and interest groups. In
the music world there are any one of several dozen narrowly defined genres of music
now, each one with its own set of acceptable behaviors and dress, attitudes, and
identity.  Taking a stance considered outside of the boundaries of a particular genre
immediately jeopardizes ones position inside that group.  In this way youth
culture, and also, the masses in general, remain forever powerless, effectively
divided and conquered. <BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>'Personal concerns' are seen as more 'timely' and hip than collective, political issues.  It's
no accident that the 90s have spawned a plethora of utterly interchangeable, whiney
'alternative' popstars. They are usually female, they play acoustic guitars, they have
short, page-boy haircuts, and they invariably sing slow, sickeningly sweet derivations
of 60s hits. These 'alternative artists' are mostly created by New York and L.A.
record company suits, corporate lackeys who think they have the definitive formula for
selling records. Pop singers are recruited according to this pre-set formula,
machine-like.  Today a majority of musicians regularly conform their musical output
to fit into this genre-racket - and willingly become pawns in the corporate game.  A
game that more often than not will discard musicians like yesterday's trash.<BR><BR>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>The 90s have been a time of corporate takeover and entrenchment, of an
extraorinarily focused competition for profits.  With unions rendered ineffective or
powerless, 90s business operations are too frequently without regard for human or
individual rights.  Big Brother is Your Boss - he lives in every company boardroom and
doesn't need a 'telescreen' to keep tabs on us - now that he's got computers and
databases and the internet, there's a virtual radio-controlled dog collar ready-made for each and every working stiff.<BR><BR>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>There's a cultural diffusion that's characteristic of the 90s; a peculiarly soft,
swampy underpinning.  The dour 1992 Seattle grunge mentality pretty much sums up
the decade; pervasive frustration, uselessness, paralysis.  The 90s have been like
one long rainy day.  So much self-absorption and weakness; 10 years spent eating
potato chips and sitting around.  A decade that will soon be glossed over and
forgotten.  A time when very little of consequence was accomplished.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../assets/images/Propaganda.gif" border=0 ALIGN=CENTER></CENTER><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The 90s have been a dark time, like a thick, damp forest, mossy and overgrown.  In
this environment it's easy for the traveler to lose his way - he can't even see the
sun.  The 90s have been a time of blocked channels, of missed connections, busy
signals, and meaningless chatter.  It's been a time for the wealthy, for the
wealthy who engineered this darkness; the wealthy who used their influence to
engender even more darkness.  Money, wads of money spent to keep everyone else in
the dark.  High tech security and spy systems, another symptom of 90s avarice. 
You've got to hand it to these sellouts, they've effectively entrenched themselves,
but this will change in time.<BR><BR>
