Diana is a zine and comic book artist, painter and all around fun guy who was busted in
1992 in Florida for doing a zine. The zine was called Boiled Angel and Mike zeroxed
about 200 of these for his friends.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"
FACE="Palatino">One of them fell into the hands of a local prosecutor named Stuart
Baggish, who took it upon himself to make an example out of Mike. Apparently Mr. Baggish
did not favor Mikes stylish renderings of hacked up bodies with crucifixes stuck through
their noses. Neither did Mr. Baggish and his fundamentalist friends take kindly to Mikes
zeroxed scatalogical renderings and anti-religious pencil sketches. </FONT></P><P><FONT
COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">SO, to set things right in the community, they crucified
Mike. Told him he couldnt come with 500 yards of anyone under 17. That he could not draw
anymore without being thrown in jail. Fined him about 5 times more money than he had
ever seen in his life. Kicked his ass, tossed him in the slammer.&nbsp; Made him pay for
visits to a shrink.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">Did the courts
find these punishments excessive?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; All the way up to the highest court in
the state.&nbsp; Because Mike's drawings were scrutinized by a bunch of respectable
Christian bureaucrats, who couldn't possibly&nbsp; be expected to understand a piece of
anti-Christian art,&nbsp; let alone tolerate it, Mike drawings were deemed to have 'no
redeeming social value,'&nbsp; and these draconian sentences were upheld.&nbsp; All this
because Mike zeroxed 200 copies of a hand drawn comic book for his friends.&nbsp; Were
Mike's hearings held in China he probably would have received&nbsp; fairer
treatment.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Palatino">While all kinds of nasty
criminals are no doubt running around in Largo Florida, Mr. Baggish and his lackeys are
pooling all their efforts in a desperate struggle to once and for all, nail that scourge
to society, comic book artist Mike Diana.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"
FACE="Palatino">After a series of unsuccessful appeals in Florida state courts, Mike is
now being forced to pay&nbsp; $3,000 worth of fines in installments.&nbsp; We're talking
about a guy who's profession has been selling junk food and cigarettes from behind cash
registers at 7-11s. Although with all the publicity this case has received, Mikes gotten
to go all over the country, has appeared in magazines (nude and otherwise), has had his
art shown in all kinds of galleries . . .&nbsp; thanks to Mr. Baggish his determined
efforts in putting Mike in the limelight.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"
FACE="Palatino">Alas, it totally sucks having heavy fines and liabilities hanging over
your head, even with the newfound publicity and other opportunities.&nbsp; Mike deserves
and needs continued support . . . as he carries his Sisyphus-like burden, doing
community service work, paying fines, and getting hit up by the man on an ongoing
basis.&nbsp; Since his case has been refused by the Supreme Court, there's no more legal
avenues open to Mike.&nbsp; So, we say, buy the guy's artwork, help him out, if you are
able to, in defiance of this sentencing.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"
FACE="Palatino">All of this proves how wrong the flag-waving propagandists really
are.&nbsp; The gulag CAN AND DOES HAPPEN HERE, and Mike Diana is just one of numerous
examples.&nbsp; Read the article below for yet another real-life example, as a crew of
bumbling, officially sanctioned armed garbagemen in New York City tried unsuccessfully
to stamp out free expression.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#CC0000" FACE="Palatino">Click

<P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">by Bob
Z</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">One of the first laws Adolph Hitler
passed when he came to power in 1930s&nbsp; Germany was to outlaw street postering and
handbilling.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">Inevitably, in today's
intolerant and backward political climate, somebody's going to poster some public area
somewhere in this country, then get busted for it.&nbsp; It's for these people this
article is written.&nbsp; </FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">You CAN
Fight and win in the courts against postering fines.&nbsp; I know, because I personally
went to the trouble of fighting a very large fine of this sort, almost certainly larger
than any fine you're going to get.&nbsp; I took this battle to the highest court in New
York State, and with the help of the ACLU and the underground music community, won a
landmark decision.&nbsp; The vague statute then being twisted around by local
prosecutors was thrown out on constitutional grounds.&nbsp; </FONT></P><P><FONT
COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">This means that there is a legal precedent now on the
books which states that you cannot be fined if your name appears on a flyer or poster
found on city property.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">Usually, the
authorities try to claim that postering is &quot;garbage&quot; and that it's an eyesore
or a 'quality of life issue' and blah blah blah.&nbsp; Forget the free exchange of
information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never mind that postering has traditionally been an important
means of information exchange in democracies.&nbsp; If the local authorities say your
information is &quot;garbage&quot; and decide to fine you for posting it, you're going
to pay up.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; WRONG.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000"
FACE="Palatino">In 1987, I was busted for flyering in New York City by a 1984-style
squad of &quot;Poster Police&quot;. At the time, Mayor Kroch and his irresponsible
cronie, then commissioner of Sanitation, Brendan Sexton, had put together an indisidious
scam to lift hundreds of thousands in postering fines from an unsuspecting population.
Their targets? Immigrants and small businesspeople who had no idea they could be fined
for postering on public property.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000"
FACE="Palatino">Every month, this goon squad of 6 fat &quot;Sanitcops&quot;, rejects who
couldn't possibly hope to become real cops, patrolled the city looking at lampposts and
phone poles, jotting down the locations and names on street flyers. Scamming lawyers at
Mayor Kroch's office figured out a loophole in the local statutes whereby this goon
squad could simply look at a name on a poster and then go ofter that person and fine
them for it. They decided to levy fines of $50 to $100 for EVERY single poster they
found. In some cases they would find hundreds of flyers with a single person's name on
them. People like these would get fines that exceeded their annual
income.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">With all the corruption in
the New York city government, and with the backing of powerful special interest groups
like the publisher of local yuppie community newspaper OUR TOWN (who sought to outlaw
street flyering so that people would be forced to buy more ads in his paper), this scam
carried on for years. Immigrants who were afraid of being deported and small
businesspeople who were ignorant of the law got fined anywhere from $50 to $10,000, and
more. Every month the city raked in from $20,000 to $100,000 in fines. If they tried to
resist, people were railroaded through administrative courts controlled by the
Sanitation Department, where people's prosecutors were also their judges. </FONT>

<BR><BR>I was fined $3,700 for posters they found with
the name Bob Z on them in 74 locations throughout New York City, posters that announced
a poetry reading and an underground punk rock show. Whether or not I posted them didn't
matter - my name was on them, they said, so I was liable. 5 Sanitcops showed up at my
door (I didn't know then that I never should have answered the door) after trying 5
times to find me. The law said that they had to serve me these tickets in person. They
stood on my stairs for an hour writing out 74 tickets.</FONT></P><P><FONT
COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">In order to fight this, I shouted long and loud to
anyone who would listen.&nbsp; I contacted a half dozen local politicians, one of whom
actually showed up at one of our street demonstrations. I got articles placed in every
newspaper I could find. All the major dailies eventually did stories.&nbsp; I held
meetings and organized others who had been similarly fined.&nbsp; We demonstrated
several times and picketed the street in front of the Sanitation Headquarters
Office.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went on TV and radio. In short, for 4 years I was compelled to
become an activist on this issue. Maybe I wouldn't have if some moron at the Sanitation
Department hadn't decided to trump up fines totalling over $22,000. But that's exactly
what they did. Every couple weeks I would get an 8-inch thick stack of tickets from the
Sanitation Department saying that I owed them over 20 thousand
dollars.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">At the time there were well
known people involved in anti-censorship struggles of their own, notably Jello Biafra
and Allen Ginsberg. These people&nbsp; heard about what happened and decided to help.
Particularly helpful were the lawyers Ginsberg had at the time.&nbsp; These were experts
in free speech issues who really knew the case law.&nbsp; I managed to convince one of
them to defend me, and by 1993, we won a complete victory in the New York State
Appellate Court.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">It took 4 years but
eventually all of my fines were struck down.&nbsp; The court ruled that the city was NOT
entitled to exact a fine just because handbills containing my name were found affixed to
city property. The entire Sanitgoon scam was undone by this decision. The City, the
Kroch Administration, and Sanit Comissioner Brendan Sexton were summarily defeated and
embarrassed.&nbsp; It's not often you see an entire municipal legal team with virtually
unlimited resources get beaten by a lone working stiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 6 Sanit Police
Poster Cops were put out of their jobs, and the city was compelled to &quot;cease and
desist&quot; their big &quot;poster sting.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000"
FACE="Palatino">What this means for others is that you CANNOT be fined for postering
anywhere unless you are actually, physically seen and caught in the act of affixing the
poster to public property. If you are fined without being seen, the law says that you
should not be fined.&nbsp; This case (New York City vs. Bob Z, 1993 ) is a legal
precedent that can and should be cited in your defense, to protect your right to create
a handbill or poster, free from authoritarian harassment.</FONT></P><P><FONT
COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">A recent (March, 1998) New York Times article tried to
stir up public opinion in favor of reviving poster police, even though the communities
don't want that and the courts have clearly rendered such prosecution
unconstitutional.&nbsp; The NY Times, like the yuppie paper Our Town, has demonstrated
its intent to drive posters off the streets, thus forcing more people to advertise in
their paper.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#DD0000" FACE="Palatino">In Giuliani time,&nbsp;
with all the increased police brutality in New York City, why shouldn't there be poster
police attacking people as well.&nbsp; Now there are currently 3 fulltime poster lackeys
back on the beat, and the top lackey heading this fearsome force is the very same
penguinesque anti-postering zealot and donut woofer John McGrath, who deemed it his
duty&nbsp; to make undercover calls to my house in 1988.&nbsp; Don't you feel safer
they're out there?&nbsp; I know I do.</FONT></TD>

Kaufman<BR><BR>As you enter this funky little church in Jack's beloved Mission District
his green monkey grinder hat is prominantly displayed. . It is a night for<BR>characters
in hats to pay tribute to the greatest character of them all: a San Francisco tribute to
Beat poet Jack Micheline. The sheer crush of colorful<BR>folks gathering has forced some
of us to sit to the side of the scuffed old stage. Here is bearded old poet George
Tsongas&nbsp; in a black Bart cowboy hat on my left and Beat chroniclert and Bukowski
biographer Neeli Cherkovski in a smart tam o' shanter on my right. And now here in a
stingy brim fedora comes<BR>Alfonso Texidor, that dapper down-at - the -heels
caf&Egrave; poet of&nbsp; frayed reknown, limping up to pinch my cheek and park his
skinny ass in the last<BR>available crack of space. <BR><BR>We're all here, all the
self-suiciding maniacs of the San Francisco poetry scene, with bitten off bits of each
others ears still stuck between our wolfish teeth: Jack Hirschman, Harold Norse,
Q.R.Hand, Gerald Nicosia, Bruce Isaacson just in from Nevada and now, for crying out
loud,&nbsp; Michael MacClure who wouldn't give Micheline the time of day when he was
alive has just walked in, humbly lowered himself to the floor and immedately sent
several signals to Kush, tonight's organizer, to jump his name ahead of the peons on the
sign-up list..&nbsp; <BR><BR>In the downstairs reception area growling videos of Jack
wailing verse to a screeching sax entertains the moochers and hanger-ons who really
don't give a<BR>shit about some croaked old Beat poet:&nbsp; they're here for a free
nosh on bagels and wine. Somehow one feels that Jack would have liked these folks
best.&nbsp; At<BR>least they're more real then the famous phonies showing up, folks who
once walked right past him when he was alive, broke, hungry and hawking his three buck
chapbooks out in the rain under the marquee of the Roxie cinema, around the corner on
Sixteenth Street.&nbsp; By now, about three hundred people have filled the upstairs
hall. Jack could have sold a lot of books tonight. <BR><BR>As cameras roll Kush kicks
off&nbsp; with a convocational chant that wrings the heart. The wind has Jack, it goes.
A lot of eyes in the place tear up, mine included for the poetry of death. Then Jack's
old sax man mounts the stage, axe in hand. In the thirty years he'd played behind
Micheline he says, Micheline would growl: 'Sax man, when my hand goes up you
play'.&nbsp; &quot;So lets imagine Jack's up here with me now&quot; says the sax man
&quot;and his hand is raised for me to blow this one last time for him&quot;. The
grieving memories of his horn turn the room into all the little jazz spots and dives
where Jack broke indifferent hearts with the truth burning in his guts. <BR><BR>Now
Neeli jumps up and delivers generous poetic praise of Michelines raw power with
words.&nbsp; This is followed by a message from Ken Kesey (e-mailed from Oregon where he
is laid up ill with a minor stroke), in which he recalls all the&nbsp; word orgies they
gigged together, the wild times. Then a balding<BR>Ferlinghetti eunich emmisary in
a&nbsp; sweator vest&nbsp; reads the City Lights publisher's&nbsp; typical Imperial
apology for his usual failure to appear for something as insignificant as the death of a
poet, followed by a few brief words of begrudging admiration and ending with how much
he'll miss running into Jack on his evening walks. Whereupon George Tsongas leans close
to my ear and rasps: &quot;When was the last time that piece of shit went out at
night?&quot; <BR><BR>Now a procession&nbsp; of yawn-crafters have their turn, MacClure
the chief Sandman among them. Soon it will be the turn of us lesser proles, who actually
knew<BR>and performed with and published alongside Jack, to restore the dozing
crowd.&nbsp; And it is&nbsp; Jack Hirschman, that uncompromising&nbsp; street activist
poet who<BR>brings down the house with one of the most&nbsp; magnificent eulogies I have
ever heard. Refusing the mike and detesting the camer he steps to the edge of the stage,
leans out into space and in his overbearing Bronx accent hurls a Molotov verse cocktail
of elegaic raging love that brings the crowd cheering to its feet and at that moment I
glance over at the famous phonies, to register their reactions to one of life's
unfailing truths, something that Micheline knew and Bukoswski lived by: in the end , the
American democratic mob, just like every other audience throughout time,&nbsp; dosen't
give a fuck about your fame, your craft, your hyper-deconstructionist French poodle
theories. They want bloody truth and awful beauty. I looked at MacClure and wondered:
&quot;Who's gonna care about your words when you're dust? I mean, really care?&quot;
<BR><BR>Just one more recollection of the fierce street poet Jack Micheline. A few years
back I had an invite to read for no pay in a few Chicago music clubs and so went working
temp downtown in San Francisco for a soul-less lawyer, trying to earn scratch to catch
that Greyhound bus and put up in some cheap Northside hotel. I was busting my ass for
the right to perform, cutting through greedy gray flannel crowds on an<BR>errand to buy
the shyster prick . hand lotion or some such crap when there's Jack old beat street poet
Micheline&nbsp; rushing along with wine-stained scowl.<BR>Upon seeing me his face
brightened like a little Bronx&nbsp; urchin weaned on Eddie Cantor and Legs Diamond, a
pure poet three sewar hitter Blakean mug of open road and tenement. He said&quot; WOT
THE FOCK YOU DOIN HERE?&quot; I stammered and laughed, ashamed, because his sea blue
eyes were so innocently pure.&nbsp; He<BR>showed me a letter he'd just got from John
Martin of Black Sparrow Press that read: Dear Jack, Thanks for your work. But I have
decided not to publish any<BR>of Bukowski's friends..&quot;and&nbsp; other hurtful
bullshit and as we both stood there riveted amidst the pyramids of our&nbsp; oppression,
Micheline said, sad &quot;I'm going back east for a while, getting out of California.
They're killing me here. &quot; and so we were&nbsp; both leaving in the night on that
poetry exodus bus and Jack raised his arm as one who had&nbsp; been to the mountain top,
he swept his cracked old&nbsp; hand over the heads of the minions of greed&nbsp;
scurrying by and he shouted: YOU KNOW WOTS WRONG WIT MARTIN!? AND YOU KNOW WOTS WRONG
WIT DESE PEOPLE DOWN HERE? DEY ARE AFRAID OF THE LIGHT! DEY FEAR! DEY ARE AFRAID OF DA
FUCKING LIGHT<BR><BR>And so you have left Jack Micheline, on the last bus into the
light, with poetry and honor, poverty, unleavened dreams, unafraid of your terror,
with<BR>the chariots at your back and the sea before you, waiting to part.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
