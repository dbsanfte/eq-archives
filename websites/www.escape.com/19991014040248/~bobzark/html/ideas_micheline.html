<P ALIGN=LEFT>As you enter this funky little church in Jack's beloved Mission District
his green monkey grinder hat is prominantly displayed. . It is a night for characters
in hats to pay tribute to the greatest character of them all: a San Francisco tribute to
Beat poet Jack Micheline. The sheer crush of colorful folks gathering has forced some
of us to sit to the side of the scuffed old stage. Here is bearded old poet George
Tsongas&nbsp; in a black Bart cowboy hat on my left and Beat chronicler and Bukowski
biographer Neeli Cherkovski in a smart tam o' shanter on my right. And now here in a
stingy brim fedora comes Alfonso Texidor, that dapper down-at-the-heels
caf&Egrave; poet of&nbsp; frayed reknown, limping up to pinch my cheek and park his
skinny ass in the last available crack of space. 

<BR><BR><P ALIGN=LEFT>We're all here, all the
self-suiciding maniacs of the San Francisco poetry scene, with bitten off bits of each
others ears still stuck between our wolfish teeth: Jack Hirschman, Harold Norse,
Q.R.Hand, Gerald Nicosia, Bruce Isaacson just in from Nevada and now, for crying out
loud,&nbsp; Michael MacClure who wouldn't give Micheline the time of day when he was
alive has just walked in, humbly lowered himself to the floor and immedately sent
several signals to Kush, tonight's organizer, to jump his name ahead of the peons on the
sign-up list.&nbsp; 
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../assets/images/DougAreYou.gif" IMG WIDTH=300 border=0></CENTER><BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>In the downstairs reception area growling videos of Jack
wailing verse to a screeching sax entertains the moochers and hanger-ons who really
don't give a shit about some croaked old Beat poet:&nbsp; they're here for a free
nosh on bagels and wine. Somehow one feels that Jack would have liked these folks
best.&nbsp; At least they're more real then the famous phonies showing up, folks who
once walked right past him when he was alive, broke, hungry and hawking his three buck
chapbooks out in the rain under the marquee of the Roxie cinema, around the corner on
Sixteenth Street.&nbsp; By now, about three hundred people have filled the upstairs
hall. Jack could have sold a lot of books tonight. <BR><BR>As cameras roll Kush kicks
off&nbsp; with a convocational chant that wrings the heart. The wind has Jack, it goes.
A lot of eyes in the place tear up, mine included for the poetry of death. Then Jack's
old sax man mounts the stage, axe in hand. In the thirty years he'd played behind
Micheline he says, Micheline would growl: 'Sax man, when my hand goes up you
play'.&nbsp; &quot;So lets imagine Jack's up here with me now&quot; says the sax man
&quot;and his hand is raised for me to blow this one last time for him&quot;. The
grieving memories of his horn turn the room into all the little jazz spots and dives
where Jack broke indifferent hearts with the truth burning in his guts. 
<BR><BR><P ALIGN=LEFT>Now
Neeli jumps up and delivers generous poetic praise of Michelines raw power with
words.&nbsp; This is followed by a message from Ken Kesey (e-mailed from Oregon where he
is laid up ill with a minor stroke), in which he recalls all the&nbsp; word orgies they
gigged together, the wild times. Then a balding Ferlinghetti eunich emmisary in
a&nbsp; sweator vest&nbsp; reads the City Lights publisher's&nbsp; typical Imperial
apology for his usual failure to appear for something as insignificant as the death of a
poet, followed by a few brief words of begrudging admiration and ending with how much
he'll miss running into Jack on his evening walks. Whereupon George Tsongas leans close
to my ear and rasps: &quot;When was the last time that piece of shit went out at
night?&quot; 
<BR><BR><P ALIGN=LEFT>Now a procession&nbsp; of yawn-crafters have their turn, MacClure
the chief Sandman among them. Soon it will be the turn of us lesser proles, who actually
knew and performed with and published alongside Jack, to restore the dozing
crowd.&nbsp; And it is&nbsp; Jack Hirschman, that uncompromising&nbsp; street activist
poet who brings down the house with one of the most&nbsp; magnificent eulogies I have
ever heard. Refusing the mike and detesting the camer he steps to the edge of the stage,
leans out into space and in his overbearing Bronx accent hurls a Molotov verse cocktail
of elegaic raging love that brings the crowd cheering to its feet and at that moment I
glance over at the famous phonies, to register their reactions to one of life's
unfailing truths, something that Micheline knew and Bukoswski lived by: in the end , the
American democratic mob, just like every other audience throughout time,&nbsp; dosen't
give a fuck about your fame, your craft, your hyper-deconstructionist French poodle
theories. They want bloody truth and awful beauty. I looked at MacClure and wondered:
&quot;Who's gonna care about your words when you're dust? I mean, really care?&quot;
<BR><BR>Just one more recollection of the fierce street poet Jack Micheline. A few years
back I had an invite to read for no pay in a few Chicago music clubs and so went working
temp downtown in San Francisco for a soul-less lawyer, trying to earn scratch to catch
that Greyhound bus and put up in some cheap Northside hotel. I was busting my ass for
the right to perform, cutting through greedy gray flannel crowds on an errand to buy
the shyster prick . hand lotion or some such crap when there's Jack old beat street poet
Micheline&nbsp; rushing along with wine-stained scowl.  Upon seeing me his face
brightened like a little Bronx&nbsp; urchin weaned on Eddie Cantor and Legs Diamond, a
pure poet three sewar hitter Blakean mug of open road and tenement. He said&quot; WOT
THE FOCK YOU DOIN HERE?&quot; I stammered and laughed, ashamed, because his sea blue
eyes were so innocently pure.&nbsp; He showed me a letter he'd just got from John
Martin of Black Sparrow Press that read: Dear Jack, Thanks for your work. But I have
decided not to publish any of Bukowski's friends..&quot;and&nbsp; other hurtful
bullshit and as we both stood there riveted amidst the pyramids of our&nbsp; oppression,
Micheline said, sad &quot;I'm going back east for a while, getting out of California.
They're killing me here. &quot; and so we were&nbsp; both leaving in the night on that
poetry exodus bus and Jack raised his arm as one who had&nbsp; been to the mountain top,
he swept his cracked old&nbsp; hand over the heads of the minions of greed&nbsp;
scurrying by and he shouted: YOU KNOW WOTS WRONG WIT MARTIN!? AND YOU KNOW WOTS WRONG
WIT DESE PEOPLE DOWN HERE? DEY ARE AFRAID OF THE LIGHT! DEY FEAR! DEY ARE AFRAID OF DA
FUCKING LIGHT<BR><BR>And so you have left Jack Micheline, on the last bus into the
light, with poetry and honor, poverty, unleavened dreams, unafraid of your terror,
with the chariots at your back and the sea before you, waiting to part.
