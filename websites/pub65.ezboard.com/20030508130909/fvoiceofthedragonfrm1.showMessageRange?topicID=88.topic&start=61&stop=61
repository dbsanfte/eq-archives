She turned around silently, her soft red locks moving slightly as a soft breez blew this erly morning, her slanted green orbs resting apon her conjured pet, a mound of sticks dirt, grass and rock, as crudly as most people put them &quot;earth pets&quot;, and a soft smile graced her lips suttely, as she turned her gaze back to the forrist below. She wasnt very tall, only stading at 5'4, but the air of nobility sturred around her whever she went, as well as a sort of kindlyness, like a mothers touch to a child. Her skin glowed a soft hue, almost a cream color in the light, and her cheek bones rose high, her face seeming to be crafted from a scuplters hand. She was a High elf, one of the noblest creatures next to Tunnare herself, or so most thought, there features fair and lith. She was from a noble family, her father a Magi and her mother an Inchantress, both so very stern, bout proud to have keept up the family tradtion of the Arkain arts once She was born. They put her through schooling of the arts, bought her her first robes and even her first spells, but once her apprentiship with Nola ended, she was slapped very hard with the relistation of just what he people really were. She had been shelterd from the predudc and bigitry for which her people loved to toss around as if it were nothing, the high elfs so much better than any other race. She soon came to relise that this was not her place, that thease were not her people, or the people she wished to know. She left them behind now thou, disowning her family and friends, vowing to make it on her own, and as such her father and mother becoming snide and sysical, wishing her the worst in anything she was to accomplish. It still hurt... rembering that fatefull day when her mother and father turnd there backs to her, wishing she had been dead insted of still breathing the same air they were. It hurt... so she was alone, and it never botherd her, to much anyway. But that is the past and She was here now, and what may have been, hopefully will never be again.Her long slenderd angualr ears twitched slightly, as she heard movement below, her eyes seeking out the sound, only to see a Fire beetle wander amlessly through a bush. She nodded satifyed and looked back up, her hands clutching her staff abit tighter, its worn wood almost comforting to her grip, its weght very well known buy now. Her form was dressed in robes, as should any reasonable spellcaster be, there threds a deep black and red, the patterns traling down her back and criss crossing up to the v shaped neck, which reveald her very soft and slender sholders, as well as her neck. She chuckled and looked back to her pet, now hopping off the worn stone of the castles remains, walking over to her pet, reaching a hand out to pet it softly-<br>
&quot; So.... Fluffy..... what mahem and chaos will we cause today?&quot;<br>
- her pet stared at her, as always, never ansering, just watching, and she turned around and slowly climed down the worn and ivy laced latter, her thoughts jumbling again as to what the day may bring- <br>
~ My name is Shyshowayn Fookerz..... i am a high elf who bows to no hand and belives in no god... i am of the Magi class and i am proud to be, and this is my tail, whever it may lead....~<br>
- She walked on though Kithicore now, the Mist soft apon her skin, making her tingle with an unattural aura, one which she only felt while letting her gift, her power, the blessing that was bestoed apon her out, weather it be a beautifull silver trinket, or a huge flaming mass of distruction. Her green orbs peerd around slowly, as she stoped in her tracks, her ears twiching yet again, Something was out here.... in her obscure and comfort place, something that could only alight the arckane within her soul..-<br>
~' The Family Awates You......'~<br>
` She blinked, and looked around, her eyes widing in fear. Had she heard this right? Or was this just a voice that she'd thought up... was she going mad?! Her eyes darted left and right, Gripping her staff even tighter, then she shook her head, and begain her pace again through the forrest, this time much faster, her pet stomping softly through the grass behind her. She always hated this place, even as a young child, hearing just the tails her fellow arcane students told her frightend her, of how the noble ranger went in, and how the dark elf army now haunted this place due to that noble rangers efforts. She stoped dead now, as the voice came again, this time louder. But there was something comforting about it.... something nice...-<br>
~'The Family Awates Shyshowayn.... Look Down.....'~<br>
- she blinked, and obeyd the voice, still unsure of what or who it origonated from, just to fearfull to dissobey it. As her green eyes travled down, in the grass, by her toe was a pendant, a tad muddy, but a soft gleam of silver could be detected. She reached down slowly, her digets on her left hand scooping up the worn item, and dusted and picked at the pendant, till it revealed the ture meaning within. A dragon.... it was a dragon incercled buy a soft silver leaf pattern. But what was it? what did it mean? She sook her head slipping the pendant into her pocket, and then, just as suddenly as the voice came, came the urge to go somewhere... a place.... a place.... called home....-<br>
