In order to survive a guild must be diverse, and in ours in particular this must be so because of the design of our charter...a democracy! Members like Goht are an inevitable product of that, and a requirement. He keeps things from getting boring in guild chat, and inspires participation. <br><br>I see this guild splitting in half, the 40+ grp and the 40- grp. This is normal and is part of the growth of a young guild. Before too long the 40+ grp will all be 46+ and headed for the planes. The lower 45 will not be invited to those raids as they can not get there. Once again this is normal. It is for their benifit and for those who will eventually be there that we have raids, and experiment with the style of raiding. <br><br>Now on to the real reason for my post. <br>At this time one of our primary goals should be recruitement of new members. Quality members that will make the guild proud. I have some ideas that I wish to discuss with Kogginn, and the officers of the guild. We need to have a Guild meeting or maybe two or three to discuss these. Here are a few things to think about on this subject.<br><br><br>Recruitment<br><br>We need to recruit members 20-30 th lvl now. This way there will not be an attitude of &quot;I am too low for raiding&quot; and so that the lower lvl chars can learn to raid without stepping in to some massive dungeon and not being able to hit a single mob.<br><br>I have some ideas, including creation of a &quot;staging guild&quot; That we would mass recruit people into and the promote them into the main guild. This is an odd idea I know, but I think would make us real unique and really bring alot of quality people into the guild and weed out all the trash before they hit the main guild. I will be talking to the guild leadership about this in the next few days and proposing a vote to the guild as a whole. <br><br>Once membership gets up we will have to start having raids that are for certain lvls (It is no fun being the proper lvl for a raid and having all the mobs cleaned out by the 40+ grp. Or to be too high and clean out a dungeon and have all the lower lvls bored.<br><br>I am not talking about splitting the guild in 2 parts, the staging guild will indescriminately recruit but would not promote them into the main guild if they are not WORTHY!!

I think this guild is already great.  I for one hope that it does not split into two groups.  Yes, people of similar levels are going to adventure together more often, but hopefully we can still all still feel like one group.  The last guild I was in evolved into a guild that seemed interested only in high level raiding.  I hope this one does not follow that path.  Perhaps it is the Peter Pan syndrome.  If that is what will happen, then I don't want to grow up.  If the time comes that the only choices for Lelana are to go to the planes to do high level raids, she will probably retire.  <br><br>I hope we do not start indiscriminately inviting people just to make our guild bigger.  (Is bigger inherently better?)  I admit that Nd invited me after a fairly short acquaintance, and that made me very nervous.  (I plied him with very direct questions for about 45 minutes before I agreed to join!)  But he was such a lovable little guy, I had to give it a try.  And lucked out.  I know nothing of the issues that are currently being discussed about newbies begging for stuff.  I would hope we would know enough about the people we are recruiting to at least know they are not beggars.  In my experience, it is usually apparent pretty quickly upon acquaintance.  But I digress.  Rather than splitting the guild, I would prefer that people in the guild organize raids, or more casual plans to adventure together, for our level 20-30 members.  I know that Esmerella and Bruloff have a more difficult time finding guild groups than Lelana and Macbruson do.  Can't explain it.  Perhaps we just need more level 29+ druids so we can at least port to a few places together.  (We both have level 21 druids but they are a long way from group ports.)<br><br>All that said, I will still listen to your ideas Maz.  That is what a democracy is all about.  And I really enjoy that most of the members of the guild will speak openly about what they like and don't like.  And we still adventure together, and help each other, and save each other's butts when necessary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/utathtar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tathtar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered , Woot.</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#993300>(11/27/01 7:59:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://championsofkaos.iwarp.com/members/mazram.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Health of our guild</span><hr size=1> I added some notes to my above post.

I like a guild that has a variety of people, classes, races and levels in it personally. That is part of the fun! I love helping out lower level characters and would miss that if the guild seemed more restricted. Tis one of the reasons I tend to wince at the uber guilds that limit acceptance to higher level peeps. Think of all the fun personalities they are missing out on just cuz &quot;Bob the druid&quot; does not get to play enough to make his character Level 55. <br><br>One note, that I have mentioned before, is that to keep things fun for lower level peeps, it would be nice to host some lower level raids or events. Make them level restricted. Now..that would not mean that higher levels could not attend of course. Sure they can come along and help out..buff to their hearts content, heal if needed or step in if things get crazy. But leave the majority of killing to the lower level peeps that are excited by killing mobs their level. Of course if standing around buffing and healing without exp gain is not your bag..tis no big deal. No one HAS to attend any of these things. Anyhow, just my two coppers worth.
