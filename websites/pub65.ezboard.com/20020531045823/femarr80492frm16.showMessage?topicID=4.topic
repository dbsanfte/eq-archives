One was small and agile, the other larger and somewhat awkward.   The parents, being not the brightest lights in the land, and having the family root surname “Bru”, called the first child Brufirst and the second child Brusecond.    The parents naturally thought Brufirst better suited for high accomplishment, and sent him to the Elven tree city for training as a master woodsman.   The other child they kept at home in the Barbarian town, hoping someone might take him on as an apprentice.   Perhaps he could be useful fetching water from the Halas well, they thought.    (They thought better of it after he nearly drowned in the well one night after stumbling into it.)  Brufirst was naturally eager to prove himself as a fearless adventurer, but so lies the first tragedy of the Bru family.   It seems he was dared to jump from platform to platform in Kelethin.   Afterward some murmured that maybe he hadn’t been so smart after all.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brusecond had always looked up to his more promising brother, and was crushed – which led to an epiphany – pretty unusual for a barbarian!   He determined to save the family name from ridicule the only way he knew, by sheer hard work.    He became a fletcher, and sold arrows to great hunters.   When he had saved enough from this he moved to the city and took up blacksmithing.  He made scores of sets of armor – in those days there was great demand for it.    And when he had saved up a small fortune he acquired a fine set of magical armor.     The future looked amazingly bright for him when he met a local shaman; they became friends and hunted together up and down the land.   When the young Macbruson appeared (in the magical land of Norrath one can never be quite sure how these things occur)  everything seemed to indicate that his life had proved to be a triumph over long odds.   But something then transpired that is a mystery that no wizard has ever been able to explain.    It was once rumored to be the work of an evil necromancer whose jealous hatred of her stepsister led her to cruel acts solely to cause misery; but no one can say for sure.    All that we do know for sure is that the shaman disappeared from his life and he went into a deep despair.   He gave up hunting and only when neighbors appealed for help did he visit the forge or the lathe.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The young Macbruson was left pretty much on his own at that point.   He also struck up a friendship with a shaman from Halas whom you know as Lelana.   The older Brusecond lectured him long and sternly on the dangers of such relationships, but of course he did not heed a single word.  “One day, I tell you, that shaman lady will see a brighter future with a group of wild eyed adventurers who want to chase off to some godforsaken wilderness, and you will be alone as I am!”    But a strange thing happened.  Brusecond found his cherished armor and his best weapons and gave them to Macbruson.   Of course you know that Lelana and Macbruson are still inseparable, and that Macbruson still wears several pieces of armor given him by Brusecond.  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Years passed.   One day Macbruson visited Brusecond.   Of course you know that because of the older barbarian’s idleness that Macbruson was now far higher in rank.   “I see you have stooped to come and visit me --- but you are still a young upstart to me.”   “Be that as it may, I have a favor to ask.”   “A favor!  Haven’t I given you enough over the years!”   Brusecond chortled.      “It is not as though you have so many other things to keep you busy!” came the reply.    Those were hard words and touched a deep reservoir of regret.    He thought to himself, the whippersnapper is right, I have just used an excuse to waste away precious time.    Macbruson did not wait for a reply but pressed on.  “If you will do this thing I will never ask your help again.   But this once I am compelled to request.”   “Very well, this once, and never again.”  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Macbruson explained that Lelana had a younger cousin who came from the same city where Brufirst had met his untimely end.   (Bringing that up nearly spoiled the whole arrangement.)   He explained that her cousin had need of training.    “Despite what you may think I have great respect for what you have taught me.   I desire you to also teach another.”    “So where is that youngster?” he exclaimed.   “Right here… “ And in walked a wood elf druid – who unbeknownst to Brusecond up to this point, was of the female persuasion.  You can imagine the old barbarian’s reaction --- but he has been true to his word.   <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And you may well imagine Macbruson smiling to himself as he watches the “training” stretch to a length of time many times greater than any normal training runs.  And that wood elf druid is now an officer of a fine guild of adventurers – and her name is Zoea.<br> <p>Macbruson 45 barb warBruloff 35 high elf clericBrusecond 33 barb war</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.showPrevMessage?topicID=4.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub65.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarr80492frm4">Announcements<option value="emarr80492frm2">General<option value="emarr80492frm3">Raids<option value="emarr80492frm5">Buy/Sell/Trade or better yet give it away!<option value="emarr80492frm10">/OOC and Funny Stories<option value="emarr80492frm11">CofK Members only<option value="emarr80492frm12">Officer Chat<option value="emarr80492frm13">Epics<option value="emarr80492frm14">The Hunt<option value="emarr80492frm15">Miscellaneous Quests<option value="emarr80492frm16">/Roleplay</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bemarr80492>Champions of Kaos</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.cofk.com">CoK Website</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
