(a.k.a. Faydedar, boss of druid epic)</span><hr size=1> Hello all, since I'm only two pieces away from completing my epic and obtaining by personal leaf-blower, I've decided to write a lil guide(actually not too small ^^) and inform you that I plan to take him down on Saturday, 19 days from now(today is monday, the 21st of March).  This is the toughest mob in the druid epic, so even though it makes sense to do him last, the other piece is NOT something I can schedule or prepare(Venril Sathir Remains).  Please be 45+ and invite friends if ya can =)  Be prepared, this is quite a long read.  But I do need y'all to read it for meh )<br>
<br>
I will arrive at the oasis approximately two hours before the deadline.  During this time, I will set up macros, get used to the arena in which we will fight him in, and annoy guildies.<br>
<br>
One hour later, an hour before I plan to get prepped, Celdaar, the mage of honor, will get a fresh KEI, hitch a ride to butcher block, run up to the docks, find the gnome translocator there then say &quot;Travel to Timorous Deep&quot;.  In preparation, I will have him print out a map of this zone.  He will end up on the elf docks, summon up some water stones for himself, and swim out to the Oasis where I am waiting.  At this point I will invite him into my group, and give him 30 pearls for CoH.<br>
<br>
By this time, it's about 30 minutes till deadline.  I will start asking guildies and whoever else is coming(Fay is no pushover for a bunch of low-mid 50's - invite your friends)<br>
<br>
After doing that business with Celdaar, Celdaar will STAY GROUPED WITH ME until everyone is there.  People wioll get rides down to south ro, then run up to the docks in Oasis.  When the boat arrives, take it to Timorous Deep.  This boat will take you to the ogre isle, and just hop off on the shore(don't go any further please).  Here I will be waiting.  I will invite the people who hop off the boat, Celdaar will CoH them, and they will disband.  If all goes well, the entire raid force will be there within a half hour.  Many people say today that the toughest part of Faydedar is just getting your forces there.<br>
<br>
Now, the preparations begin.  Everybody will disband, drop all buffs, kill all pets, take down anon or roleplay, and put up LFG.  This will let me know who is available for a group.  A team of buffers will do all the work first.  I am hoping to bring KEI and Aego/HoV to the raid, though this might not happen.  One or two druids will first individually junk buff everybody.  See Invis, Resist Disease, Resist Poison, and Resist Cold.  Then, real buffs start coming into play.  First comes KEI for casters, then Aegolism or HoV for everybody.  Then, we cast the enchanter group magic buff thingee then druid Circle of Winter(or seasons) on the groups.  People will group up for these last four group buffs, so the buffers can easily do /tgb on and buff 6 people at once.  Mod rods will be given to priest classes from a mage.  The main tank will be equipped with a mage damage shield.  All the tanks will be equipped with haste.<br>
<br>
THE STRATEGY<br>
<br>
Before I make the handin, I have to assign groups.  The main tank group will consist of the MA, the SA, the Main Damage, 2 clerics, and 1 55+ bard if available.  Before the fight begins, the MA will be SITTING on the shoreline.  Everyone else in the group will be standing behind the main tank, a good 10 feet away.<br>
<br>
The initiation group will consist of the Monk or SK puller, and the rest will be made up of Paladins.  Yes, paladins.  You will see why.<br>
<br>
The third group will be called the Water Healers.  This group sits in the water at the tunnel entrance to the Oasis.  This consists of any other clerics, a druid and/or a shammy to baby sit them.  In this strategy, this group is arguably the most vital.<br>
<br>
Everybody else(int casters) will be placed at the wall of the Oasis and form groups.  These are most likely nukers.  Other melees and spare priests will wait with them.<br>
<br>
FAYDEDAR HIMSELF<br>
Faydedar is a dragon.  Albeit, he is a very small dragon.  He has the graphic of a Velium Crawler from Crystal Caverns.  But he'll still kick your ass around TD and back.<br>
<br>
He has 32k hps, hits for mid 300's max, and technically speaking is a mage.  There is a cruel twist to this mob, for those of you who don't know.  Anyone who ever sits down at any moment of the fight is automatically moved to the top of his hate list.  I'll repeat this again.  NO ONE WILL EVER SIT DOWN AT ANY PORTION OF THE FIGHT, FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.  Except.. for the main tank sitting at the very beginning.  This can be prevented by a horse, but by no other means.  This is to make sure that he starts out with the agro.<br>
<br>
Faydedar also haas two spells: Dragon's Roar, and Lava Breath Weapon.  Dragon's Roar is a magic-based AE fear spell.  He casts this every 15 seconds.  Lava Breath Weapon is an AE fire-based nuke, dealing up to 500 points of damage, and dispelling a buff, sometimes two.  Because of these spells, you must get your fire resist up to at least 90, and your magic resist to 50.  This does NOT MEAN that you should stop there!  Get these two as high as you possibly can.  If you don't come with these, plan on an early death.<br>
<br>
When I make the hand in, Faydedar will use dragon's roar, the monk or SK puller will wade into the water, bring him to the main tank who is sitting down, and Feign Death.  NOBODY WILL BE CASTING.  NO BARDS WILL BE SINGING.  AND NOBODY EXCEPT FOR THE MAIN TANK WILL BE SITTING.  THERE WILL BE NO PETS.  He will immediately start whacking on the main tank.  ONLY THE MAIN TANK WILL BE DOING ANYTHING AT ALL.  He will fight and taunt Faydedar.  Everyone else will just watch.  When the Main tank gets low on hit points, 40%, have the first paladin cast LoH on the tank.  The order of these paladins will be determined during the prepping phase, so keep your ear ospen.  If one of the tanks in the Main Tank group is a paladin, he will be asked to go first.  After the rotation of LoH is over, the Main tank will call assist.  As soon as this happens, all the melees will get into melee range and start whacking Faydedar.  ONLY THE MAIN TANK WILL TAUNT.  As soon as the assist is called, all the healers on land will cast ONE baby heal.  Then as soon as this heal hits, the first cleric(in the main tank group) in the CHeal rotation will cast CHeal.  This rotation will also be determined pre-battle, but Faydedar can fear.  Fear not, I know this, and I have planned for it.  When the assist is called, the pet classes will summon their pets, send them in and use their pet buffs/hastes on them.  Mages, please use fire pets.<br>
<br>
The next part of the strategy is what will make the day.  Since Faydedar won't be all too pleased with the 2-3 clerics rotating CHeal, they are bound to get hit by Dragon's Roar.  When this happens, the Main Cleric(the one who started the CHeal rotation at the assist call) will have a macro set up, saying &quot;Land Healers have been feared!  Water healers, it's your turn!&quot;  When this is called, the healer group at the tunnel will rush up, and start their own CHeal rotation.  Being the leader of this group, I will have a macro set up.  Luckily, by the time we get hit by Dragon's Roar, the Original land healers will have the fear worn off, and they will be back healing again.  The main cleric will also have a macro set up for when they are back near the main tanks.<br>
<br>
If the main tank dies, move on the secondary tank.  If he dies too, Faydedar will be really hurting.  Move on the Damage Tank.  If this is necessary, and push comes to shove, I will ask all the nukers to completely unload on Fay, as I don't want the raid to wipe when we're that close.<br>
<br>
One thing you need to know about all dragons is that spells won't land on them unless you are in melee range.  Yes, you heard me.  Faydedar is no exception.<br>
<br>
Other than all that strategy junk, here is the fight plan:<br>
<br>
80% Enchanter will enter melee range, and Tash Faydedar.  Pet classes summon pets now and send them in.<br>
70% Chanter or Shaman will enter melee range and slow Faydedar.<br>
60% All nukers will enter melee range and nuke Faydedar.  Do not nuke as much as possible.  Nuke once every 10 - 15 seconds.<br>
If everyone plays along well, it should just go peachy.<br>
But, at 20%, if it's getting down to the wire and it seems real close, I'm going to ask all nukers to unload everything they have.  Two simultaneous nukes from all capable of doing so will finish Faydedar.<br>
<br>
If this all goes well, I will not mind hosting as many Faydedar raids as Sonjaleah or whatever druid or officer sees fit. <br>
<br>

BTW... forgot about how to make a CR - Fay despawns in 40 minutes of NOT BEING AGROED.  If we wipe, ill bring a cleric to the outer ring of the oasis, everyone will go afk for 40, and then when Fay despawns we can enter and start rezzing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=watchyurbb>WatchyurBB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Green Snake</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/22/03 10:45:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE</span><hr size=1> Enemy surely you don't mean me?

For those of you wondering, there will be two routes taken - Celdaar and I will use the gnome translocator to get to the elf docks then swim to the Oasis(part of the route is underwater, Celdaar make some water stones please), then druids n wizzies will port to SRo, please don't stop unless you see the big Cyclops waiting for whacking, run up to the docks.  Hitch a ride from the boat there(if you have levi on, take it off, boat will leave from under your feet!), then in TD jump off at ogre isle and wait there.  I should be there, giving invites to get a CoH from Cel.<br>
