I am also interested in the reaction of warriors to this situation.<br>
<br>
Bruloff (34 cleric) was in a group the other day not long after getting Sup heal.   Sup heal is about 17% more efficient mana wise than greater heal, assuming the target is not over healed (you wait until the target's health is down sufficiently to get all the healing applied.)   Since sup heal does 583 hp heal, this means that level 30ish warriors, even if buffed to 1500 hps or so, must be down over 2 bubbles to get the advantage of sup heal.<br>
<br>
So I announced to the backup healer and the warrior who was main assist not to panic until the main assist was below 50% health, as I planned to use sup heal as the main healing option.<br>
<br>
We had 2 warriors in the group.  The main assist started to complain at once that this was too dangerous.  If she ran into a goon, she would need near full health to run to zone.  After hearing this for a while, I gave the healing over to another member of the group and stated I would nuke - which was fine with me and seemed to keep everyone calm. <br>
<br>
My other high char is a 42 warrior.  Personally having my health go low doesnt bother me while fighting as long as I am getting regular messages from the cleric that suggest they arent LD.  Personally I like to see the cleric chat a lot - even if it is just stating mana every 10%.  But my survivability while pulling depends almost entirely on one thing - SoW.  In my opinion for example in OT, if smacked by a goon if I have 50% health and SoW I will survive - with 100% health and no SoW I won't.<br>
<br>
Anyway I wonder what opinions you healers and tanks have.<br>

<br>
As you may have noticed, I am not a big fan of waiting too long to heal.<br>
<br>
I tend to heal casters if they lose 1 bub or more of thier HP, as soon as i can.<br>
Tanks after losing more than 2 (3 if I am LOM).<br>
<br>
There are always exceptions...  Like if someone loses three bubbles of health in a 2 second period.  <br>
<br>
Also take into account that Greater heal at your level is still faster than Sup heal...  So It may be worth it to Greater THEN Super...  I have that issue arise frequently except I use exclusively Superior healing and Celestial healing.<br>
<br>
But it truly does depend on the situation.<br>

I get concerned around 1 bubble.  The key to keeping your tanks happy is to let them know what's going on.  This means spam, and lots of it... we are less likely to panic if we know a heal is being cast, even if we're very low on health.  Macros macros macros.<br>
<br>
The best spam I've seen was from some random cleric I grouped with in DL.  It was something like this:<br>
<br>
Casting Superior Heal on Zoldarf (640hp, cast time 6 sec)<br>
<br>
It was nice to know how long it would be before the heal landed.   Back then you didn't know how much you'd been healed for either, so this information was nice too.<br>

<br>
Since I was pretty much dirt-poor until level 39, I didn't have much wisdom gear. (Or any other good gear--I was still using a WOODEN SHIELD at level 41.) That meant that I had to use my mana as efficiently as possible, and I still have a tendency to do that, as anyone who has watched me cast Complete Healing on Styrogur when he's almost dead can attest.<br>
<br>
So, when I got Superior Healing, I tried to make sure it counted. I'd try to time my heals to that tanks would end up with over 80% but just under 100% health. (hitting 100% meant wasted mana.) If I'm doing my job right, it will be a rare case where the tank would have lived if I had just spent the mana to get him to 100%. It's much more likely that, by saving mana, I may save someone's life when I might otherwise have been OOM.<br>
<br>
For INT casters, I kept Greater Healing memmed, and always tried to get them to 100%. (If they ended up barely under I would let natural regen finish it off. Less than 95% or so, I'd spend the mana to heal them the rest of the way.) For other healing classes, I'd get them up above 80%, and figure if they wanted to top off they could do it themselves.<br>
<br>
Basically, and I believe Styrogur will agree with me on this, any sowed tank in OT who's not willing to go out and pull when he's at 40% is a cockatrice--I mean, a chicken. <p>Styrogur (Ogre Warrior)<BR>Styrona Nightingale (High Elf Cleric)<BR>Styrogyro Mindwarper (Erudite Enchanter)<BR>Styrosham (Ogre Shaman)<BR>Styrog (Dwarf Rogue)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Kehli</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(1/7/02 8:22:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Int caster here</span><hr size=1> For me personally, if I am taking any damage at all, it mean I have generated aggro, prob by mezzing or stunning, and that aggro prob wont go away anytime soon.<br>
<br>
In other words, if I take a bub of damage, I will die without a fast heal. They want me dead. Period. <br>
<br>
Its a strange symbiosis, the cleric chanter relationship - the chanter needs the cleric to stay alive, the cleric needs the chanter to control the mobs so they can keep the team alive.  If the chanter or the cleric dies, the group is often in serious peril.  Many times I have run into the fray to try and stun a mob off Kog, or mez a mob uder attack, just to generate the very aggro that may kill me, in order to give kog the precious seconds to save our tank.<br>
<br>
I would far sooner have Kog rez me, than lose another teammate that could have been saved - BUT - if I die, I cant control the mobs.<br>

Hey!  I feel great then...  T'other day the add took on a pet.   Well I managed to check it and just barely get it healed in time.  And it kept the mob busy thrn for long enough for the tanks to finish mob A and support it.<br>
<br>
Its tough tho with no pet health display.  I suggest this is another reason NOT to heal everybody right away with smaller heals.   The interval between big heals is longer, more time to check pets and etc.<br>

Re: kehli's remarks:<br>
<br>
1. Why do clerics keep their best stun and root up?<br>
Esmerella: to give me a break to mez the mob when it aggros on ME. <br>
<br>
2. Why do enchanters keep single and area mez up?<br>
Bruloff: to mez the mob that aggroed on ME.<br>
<br>
3. Why should clerics buff the enchanter like she is a warrior?<br>
Bruloff: see #2.<br>
<br>
Result: they are still together after 35 seasons.  But it is strange relationship, I agree.<br>

Have another hotkey that says &quot;Please heal my pet&quot;, or something along those lines, and hit that when he needs to get juiced up.  This should save you some typing, and you won't have to have your pet targetted all the time.<br>

after i cast what dots and drop what nukes i want...and my pet is doing his own thing for some DAMN reason that i have no clue of....i switch to the 2nd mob drop some dots  (providing we dont have a chanter) then imediatly target my pet..... i can heal my pet pretty good, but if a cleric is trying to heal my pet  he/she can just assist me and Whackola  pet targeted....  targeting a skelly pet is one of the most Frustraiting things in the game...  i have found an nifty way for u to check your own pets health quick simple and painless<br>
<br>
the F1 button targets you on the 1st press.......<br>
if you have a pet up  F1 a 2nd time targets your Pet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
this only works for your pet and not anothers.......<br>
<br>
if there are multiple mobs and u need to concentrate on 1 and dont want to lose the target  simply make a hotkey for<br>
<br>
/pet report health<br>
<br>
it comes up as percents but any ninny can figure that out.....<br>
i hope!<br>
<br>
as far as u having a pet Tank and have a cleric heal because you are Tank Impaired......have the Doof cleric make an /target key  (Z is right my bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /assist key will only get u a mob)with your Pets name in it...<br>

Yes, let the necros heal themselves, unless they're down to a bubble or so... If they're that low it probably means they're OOM, or running for their life.  Or FD for their life.<br>

Upper level Clerics have many options for excellent strategies. Having never played a cleric, I can only offer my magely observations.<br>
<br>
Aamadar chain cast a group heal on us at a Naggy raid. It worked, we all survived. An excellent tactic which I had not experienced before.<br>
<br>
I have heard of clerics casting celestial heal on the main tank at the beginning of a battle, even if they have not taken a hit of damage yet. <br>
<br>
I have also heard of clerics casting celestial heal on the enchanter as soon as an add is detected. This seems to make happy, healthy enchanters.<br>
<br>
Being a mage, I am often the secondary source of mana for the cleric after buffs or rezzes. Cleric mana seems to be key in most cases, and we all toss mana at them when possible. Tanks often ignore the mana reports of anyone but the cleric.<br>
<br>
Group tactics in general: Strangely, I have adopted the role of &quot;secondary tank&quot; in many groups I am in. It's OK, I wear +HP gear and better AC than most mages. Now, the point I want to make in this paragraph is this: Clerics can NOT heal 6 different people at once! Heal spells take about half an hour to cast, and if the damage can not be all directed to ONE tank, then the &quot;secondary tank&quot; sort of needs to be established. <br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.<br>

You've been watching clerics work for a long time now... I think you're got a good understanding of how they operate.  Same with chanters and druids and warriors, etc.  Anyone who's played the game long enough has a pretty good grasp of how the different classes work, and can recognize the difference between good ones and excellent ones...<br>
<br>
Celestial heal is great for clerics.  Low agro, mana-efficient, etc.  However, at the higher levels, this spell becomes nearly worthless for the main tank.  They are taking damage faster than celestial heal is capable of healing.  Celestial healing is fine for healing peeps who do not have agro, but something a little more immediate is needed if they are actively taking damage from the mobs.<br>
<br>
This phenomenon was especially apparent to me on last weekend's skyfire raid.  I was regularly getting doubled for 160 damage a hit... which is far more damage than celestial healing is capable of repairing in a timely manner.  In these situations, the main tank needs to be getting complete healed.  This takes timing and preparation on the part of the cleric, and some coordination with the tank.<br>

Some of you might see me use it often.  Why do I use it?  Well because it heals almost as much as superior healing, it is a 3 second cating time instead of 4.5 AND it cost less than half the mana that Superior heal does.<br>
<br>
Celestial heal is still in my lineup...  But I use uit much less frequently now that I have remedy.<br>
<br>
For example...  I pulled Kehli out of the purple the other night with remedy.  That is something that is nearly imposible to do!<br>

<br>
I enjoy watching the very clever clerics using Complete Heal.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's more like &quot;Translocate to Bind Point in Under 10 Seconds&quot; and other times it's &quot;Cleric saves tank, and has 80% mana leftover&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Complete is a very tricky sucker. Can a cleric predict the next 10 seconds of damage on his meat shield? If they can.... it's complete heal for you! If not... well then it's &quot;Consent me now, you're already dead&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Styro seems to be the best complete healer I have yet seen. Perhaps that's because Styro is the tank AND the cleric!<br>
<br>
I've also seen a significant number of non-completes followed immediately with a complete, which seems to be effective in predictable damage situations. Complete healing takes SO long to cast, it also locks the cleric into a spell that he/she HAS to finish, and they are unavailable to heal other groupmates. When they are sure they have time for complete, either the battle is over, or the target is no longer taking damage, or the cleric has excellent damage forecasting skills. Any way you slice it, it's a slippery, dangerous slope with complete heal.... it works great on my earth pet though!<br>
<br>
one last point: safety before effeciency, and kudos to the clerics. I'm sure I'd have trouble with &quot;healers guilt&quot;<br>

<br>
I have had bouts with the &quot;healers guilt monster&quot;.  However with the 90% rez...  I dont feel it as much. <br>
<br>
I try to remember the one thing that is oh so true in ALL situations.  Each individual player is responsible for his/her own life.<br>
<br>
There are many times, when no matter how hard I try, a player's death is inevitable.   For example, if a player draws enough agro...  All the healing in the world wont be enough.  Or if a huge train agros on one player, Loading... Please Wait.<br>
<br>
But I try.<br>

That's why I keep healing Elarin when she's only down a little. She's died so many times on my watch that I keep hoping that, with those few extra hit points, I may have time to get a heal on her before she dies.<br>
<br>
With shamen and necros who are converting health to mana, I heal them if my mana's in good shape. Generally they are expending a lot of mana on nukes and dots, while I lounge around medding and casting a heal every once in a while. I consider it a transfer of mana from me to them. <p>Styrogur Dreadnaught (Ogre Warrior)<BR>Styrona Nightingale (High Elf Cleric)<BR>Styrogyro Mindwarper (Erudite Enchanter)<BR>Styrosham (Ogre Shaman)<BR>Styrog (Dwarf Rogue)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/ulananirigger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lananirigger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#993300>(1/25/02 3:36:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cleric tactics (complete heal)</span><hr size=1> Rofl,  That is a good way of looking at it Styromanynames.,,,,  ok  you can heal me,  SOMETIMES  :O<br>
