her body and lay back rapturously as the warm dawn<br>
washed over her.  She examined herself critically. <br>
The years had been good to her, she decided.  Her<br>
breasts were of average size, but firm, and her<br>
muscles were well toned due to her travel and active<br>
life style.  Being a bard was more than just sitting<br>
in a warm hall singing to the gentry.  Bards were the<br>
messengers and intelligence gatherers of Norrath,<br>
keeping watch on the people in concert with the<br>
Rangers.<br>
Ranger.......thinking of the word she ran her<br>
fingertips across her stomach, lightly caressing<br>
herself.  The memory of last night flooded her with a<br>
soft glow.  She smiled...there is indeed nothing like<br>
spending time with a lover who knows you well.  She<br>
would have to thank Skysinger for sending her on this<br>
mission.  She looked to her left at the elf sleeping<br>
next to her.  Seeing Bladeleaf again after these<br>
several seasons......  It was fortunate that Lord<br>
Morin had sent this particular ranger to meet her....<br>
Why, of course, it was a plan.  She had been moody<br>
lately and  had heard rumors that Bladeleaf had been<br>
hurt.  Morin and Skysinger had plotted to put them<br>
together.....  Her smile broadened and she breathed a<br>
silent prayer to her goddess and to Tunare for<br>
granting both of them this respite.  <br>
She turned and examined the ranger.  His body was bare<br>
to the waist and she could see the scars that were his<br>
service stripes for his years in the guild.  Most of<br>
the scars were old, some were newer and there was a<br>
new red slash that had barely healed.  She touched the<br>
oozing red sore.....maybe a Luggald knife.  Bladeleaf<br>
started at her touch, moaned, then settled back. <br>
After a minute he began to snore softly.  The sound<br>
brought a smile to her lips.  &quot;Just like a kitten&quot;,<br>
she thot.  &quot;Such a comforting sound.....&quot;<br>
She traced the scar that ran from his left eye to his<br>
jaw.  The scar and the skin that covered him were<br>
souvenirs of their first meeting.  The tear that fell<br>
from her eye was for those who died that night....She<br>
touched the lion skin.  How like him, she thot, all<br>
his equipment seemed newer, but he still kept that<br>
sleeping robe.<br>
A pressure in her groin told her that she had to find<br>
the midden, so she kissed Blade's sleeping lips and<br>
swung her legs over the side of the pallet, standing<br>
as she searched for her robe.  It was too late that<br>
she realized that she was some twenty feet up in a<br>
large tree, and there was no floor.  She screamed as<br>
she began to plummet toward the ground.<br>
Suddenly her fall was stopped.  A strong arm gripped<br>
her around the waist and held her up.  There was a soft<br>
laugh and elvish words caressed her ear.<br>
&quot;I did not know, dear lady, that bards had found a<br>
song to let them fly.  Word of this has not reached<br>
Ranger Hall.&quot;<br>
She grasped his arm tightly, almost cutting his<br>
circulation.  Below her a herder wiped nightsoil from<br>
his face as he wondered if, in fact, he had really seen long<br>
legs and feminine parts in the branches above.  By the<br>
time he could see again, the vision had disappeared<br>
and the leaves were moving slowly in the wind.<br>
Bladeleaf swung Casseia back into his nest, holding<br>
her closely and stroking her as he sang a soft elvish<br>
song.  Casseia did not know the words, but images of<br>
soft green grass and running water soothed her mind<br>
and slowed her heart.  She nestled against him and<br>
touched his cheek.<br>
&quot;Once again, my friend, you have saved my life.  I<br>
have had nights I would have died to hold you, and now<br>
I almost did.&quot;<br>
The ranger laughed softly.  &quot;I would not have you do<br>
so, lady.  Rather than cause harm to you I would tie<br>
myself to a tree and physically restrain myself from<br>
your company.&quot;<br>
He sang softly to her for a few moments and she began<br>
to relax and feel the places where their bodies<br>
touched.  This was the best part of loving, she thot,<br>
the time together and the intimacy that needs no<br>
words.  She almost purred herself as her hand stroked<br>
his almost hairless torso, touching a pendant she had<br>
not noticed before.<br>
&quot;What is this my love?  I dont believe I've noticed it<br>
before.&quot;<br>
He smiled.  &quot;It is a love charm.  Many elves wear one<br>
to bring them the love that Dar and Ally found.&quot;<br>
She held the pendant in her hand.  It was enamelled<br>
green trimmed in gold, with elf runes she could not<br>
read.  The chain was of finest gold, dwarf work from<br>
Kaladim by the craft. &quot;It is beautiful.  Did your<br>
mother give it to you?&quot;  <br>
&quot;No,&quot; he said sadly.  &quot;She died young.  My nurse gave<br>
this to me.  He knew my father too well to expect me<br>
to have much love there.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why have I never noticed it?&quot; she asked.  <br>
&quot;It is magicked; a minor camoflauge spell. If I do not wish<br>
it to be seen it is not.&quot;<br>
She weighed it in her hand. &quot;Then I assume you wished<br>
me to see it for some reason....&quot;  <br>
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe it is time you knew me better.&quot;  She rotated so her hips rubbed against him, kissing him as she did.  &quot;It would be hard for me to know thee better, my lover,<br>
than I do now.&quot;<br>
Bladeleaf returned the kiss and drew back slightly. He<br>
looked at the locket for a moment, then took it from<br>
her hand.  With his fingernail he loosed the clasp,<br>
and then returned it to her.  Inside she could see the<br>
picture of a male elf with stern features and dark<br>
hair.  The face was totally empty of feeling and could<br>
almost have been made of stone.  She turned the locket<br>
so she could see the other side.  Her eyes widened at<br>
the picture of a beautiful elf woman with auburn hair<br>
and flashing green eyes.  Casseia thot she was the<br>
most beautiful elf she had ever seen.  And then it hit<br>
her.......she had seen those green eyes before, both<br>
in the babe the woman held in her arms and in the ranger<br>
Casseia had held in hers.  She raised her eyes to<br>
Bladeleaf who nodded slowly.  <br>
&quot;Aye.  Darraya and Allyara were my parents.&quot;<br>
&quot;Your father is dead?&quot;  <br>
&quot;No, he lives.  But it is by his hand that I was driven from Kelethin, although I must needs say that he had cause.  But while he lives it is possible I may never see my home again, at least as a welcome visitor.&quot;   He smiled.  &quot;Although I do<br>
sneak in sometimes for practice and a glimpse of home.<br>
I do have fond memories of much of my childhood.&quot;<br>
Casseia lightly touched the woman's face.  It looked<br>
so real and alive.  &quot;I thot she had died in<br>
childbirth.&quot;  <br>
&quot;No, she was killed in the last orc invaision of Kelethin.  That was when all joy went out of my father and led to our parting.&quot;  <br>
Casseia touchedhis face.  &quot;I'm sorry, dear one.  It must have been hard.  Why did you quarrel?&quot;  <br>
Bladeleaf closed the locket and rolled on his back, pulling the bard on top of him.  The locket seemed to blend into his chest.  Smiling, he leaned up and kissed the tip of her<br>
breast.<br>
&quot;That is another story, dear one, and not for this meeting.  I believe the heads of our orders have ordered us here both for our own interests as well as those of our halls.&quot;  He returned his attention to her breasts as she kneaded his shoulders.  <br>
&quot;And I would waste no more of this given time.&quot;<br>
<br>
...................................................................<br>
Some time later, Casseia couldn't tell if it was hours<br>
or minutes, she lay quietly on top of Bladleaf.  The<br>
ranger was laying with his eyes closed, idly stroking<br>
the bard's hair.  Casseia ran her hand across his<br>
chest and once again encountered the locket.  She<br>
traced the elf-runes on the front.  An idea crossed<br>
her mind and she propped herself up on her elbows, looking thru the chain loop at her lover.  &quot;Blade, what<br>
do these runes mean?&quot;<br>
He stirred quietly, raising his head and looking at<br>
the locket thru half-lidded eyes.  &quot;You read elvish,<br>
what does it say?&quot;<br>
She made the sounds but could not scry the meaning. <br>
&quot;Ah...Ah....A'dar..aye..ah Linderer?&quot;  She thot for a<br>
moment.  &quot;Were you named after your father?&quot;<br>
He smiled and sat up to kiss her nose.  &quot;The A' at the<br>
beginning means oldest son of.....  Literally, it<br>
means the oldest son of Darraya Lindener, or Darraya<br>
Lindener, Jr.&quot;<br>
&quot;Your real name........&quot; she dropped the locket back<br>
on his chest and lay her ear next to it.  She smiled<br>
to her secret self. &quot;At last,&quot; sher thot, &quot;I know your<br>
real name.&quot;<br>
<br>
The End<br>
