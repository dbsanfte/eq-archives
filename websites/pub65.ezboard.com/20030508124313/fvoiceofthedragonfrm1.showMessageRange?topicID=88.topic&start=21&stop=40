I was lucky, and my room as well. Who knows what would have happened if I had not been playing with my spells. Though I never have figured out how Endure Fire stuck to my room.<br>
  It was all my fault though. I had hunted too many orcs. But how was I supposed to know that the whole hoard of them would follow me and call for reinforcements of the ENTIRETY of orc kind? I didn't expect that EVERY orc alive would come to avenge their dead!<br>
  Through the remains of the front door I go, following the familiar path that is only barely there. My room! Still intact, and camo wearing off. Good.<br>
  WHAT!?!?! A YELLOW CON SNAKE IN GREATER FAYDARK!? BUT I'M A LVL 28!!! WOOT!! I'm alive and it is dead! but the poison runs deep, and I am low on life. Oh well, I can knock it, but I'll use it... the Uber Ranger Heal... aka.. Light Healing! My health it has returned! But the poison runs deep in my veins! My bed, I'll lay down to gain mana, and to wait the poison out. The worst thing that'll happen is that I'll die in familiar surroundings.<br>
  The room, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  it spins. I shall sleep this poison off. My dreams, how troubled! Toter!! Don't leave me!! I shall try to save you! after all, you once cared for me now it's my turn to care for you, and free you from the prison in which you are bound! But I shall need help dear brother! Do not be dissapionted in me! The darkness! NOOO! It is like it was that night, the night our parents were slaghtered! Go away dreams GO!<br>
  Peace in my mind at last! Time to heal and sleep some more..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sonjaleah>Sonjaleah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of Scale</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/1/03 9:03:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the next day</span><hr size=1> Hiding again it seems ..crying softly - tears flowing damping my armor.

Yes, I must seek her to cast an Enchantment.  What about protection?  Surely I can not sleep alone in the Frontier Mountains.  The giants make noises that I can not even begin to imagine.  <br>

I put down my breast plate and grab my back plate from the floor I notice a extremely large scorch mark on it. What Forst giants don't nuke. Then it dawns on me druids do.

  Pera!  Stop that.  You know better.  You know the curse which seems to follow you...You know what happens when you get close to someone...they are stripped from you...taken just when you need them.....Do not entertain such thoughts you foolish Elf!..<br>

  ...still she wept...not hearing my approach...Had she followed me here?  The fooprints revealed she had, and then had taken refuge behind this small rise in the snow..But for what purpose?  Why had she chosen to follow me across the miles and miles of terrain?  Why did her face, wracked by tears as it was, so calming to the ghosts which haunt me?<br>
 <br>
  ..I approach...silently...something inside screams to run now before all is lost...but i cannot...'tis the primal forces within me that spur me forward...<br>
 <br>
  ..sle is startled as i help her up, and with a soft finger to my lips, i bid her make no sound.  Using a small cloth, i wipe the tears from her face, and embrace her..this woman whose name i do not know..whose face i awoke to, who followed me here through blinding snow to watch over me...whose lithe form awoke passion........<br>

  ...Pera...just remember..this is Salvation or Damnation you flirt with here...For into every life there comes One Soul which will complete thee...<br>

  &quot;Weep not M'lady...For thou art no longer alone.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  I utter the words softly, carried on the bitter breeze and warming everything around..She feels it too.  I see her relax but for the moment the words hang there, and then she starts to cry anew, burying her head into my shoulder.<br>
 I hold her tight.  And let my own tears pour forth.  For perhaps..just perhaps, it is not she, but I who am no longer alone...<br>
 <br>
 ..Do I dare dream, Holy Tunare?  Hast thou brought this woman to me?  Do I dare hold on to the dream of Peace at last?<br>

Unwanted, I slip into the realm of invisibility.  Perhaps my sadness will hide me from the view of those that experience the joy of being happy.  Why must it always end such as this?  Why must I always be the one to smile and wish the others a Merry time?  <br>
<br>
NO! Do not relent.<br>
<br>
Everyone is to be happy.  Smile, be happy.  Help your friends and family.  Be one unto them all.  Karana give me strength, for I lack that which is neccissary for the task that has been put before me.  I take a moment under my cloak of sadness, and compose myself for my job.  <br>
<br>
NO! Do not relent.<br>
<br>
Composure will be mine, and I will prevail against evil.  Complaints never have an effect on me, and I won't let my personal life interfere with my job. (although a comp with EQ on it would be nice....oops...roleplaying sorry). Be it friend, or foe, I shall help.  I shall listen.  My two little ears will be large, and only yours shall you ever need them.  Casting off my cloak, I return to my soap box, and begin the ever constant vigil against evil.  Join me friends as we march toward greater goods, as we strive to better ourselves, and our family.  Sit with me, and share stories with me, smile with me, and laugh with me.  Shall we cry? Only if you feel so compelled.  Shall we giggle? Only if you are giddy!  Shall we embrace each other as family? Always and forever I shall embrace all of you as my family. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whispurrwillowind>WhispurrWillowind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Green Snake</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/2/03 2:55:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: headache </span><hr size=1> …my hand picks up another scallop and as I gently drop it in my bag I notice that I need to forage more.  How many scallops did she say she needed for her stew?  My mind is so groggy from the intake of ale and my head still hurt. I am amazed I am able to gate.  And gate I did right back to the ice barren place called Eastern Waste.  Where the walruses live and the snow bunnies are plentiful.  <br>
<br>
Camouflaged, I continue to scavenge the land while trying to recall how I ended up in one of the musty rooms above the barkeep last night. The barkeeper gave a short retort that the Shadowknight threw him a few silvers and carried me upstairs. He then returned moments later to polish his armour and took off shortly there after, insisting that I was not to be disturbed. <br>
<br>
The barkeeper’s wife was kind enough to give me a quick repast at daybreak and as compensation, I offered assistance in procuring her with scallops.  So here I am, alone again, in this desolate place looking for sea creatures and wondering when will I ever return home.  Home…Kelethin, so long I yearn for the sight of thee.  The fresh scent of your forests and the wetness of your grass between my toes warm my heart.  Kelethin, where a nice warm bath awaits me.  Looking at my dingy and smelly clothes I vow to return home as soon as I deliver this bag.  I look inside the sack again, wishing there were more.  Maybe she would be content with a mixture of fishing grub?   <br>
<br>
A storm approaches.  I hurry myself for a quick departure to Shadow Haven and as I am about to fade away, I catch a glimpse of Him, above the hill, alone, engaged in a fierce battle with a Frost Giant.  I try to break the spell to offer assistance but the pull is too strong and I re-appear on the centre floor of The Nexus.<br>
<br>
Should I go to him? Would he welcome my support or would I be just a hindrance, remembering how I miss my target and blast him instead?  I lower my head in shame and slowly make my way to the barkeep…<br>
<br>
I open the door of the establishment and I grin, thinking…He carried me to bed…how exciting…and yet, I woke up wearing only my undergarments… I can’t remember anything!  &quot;By the Blessed Tunare, Whispurr why did you imbibe so much alcohol?&quot;  <br>

Her eyes filled with passion as she began to undress for me. What a wonderfull moment that was. The best moment of that night.

How could it be he? I mean I know he didn't always like us, but we were still family... I trusted him, I cared about him... How could he have done that? And now he has Toter! Yet I must wait to save him...<br>
<br>
Ahh. My heal may not be the best, but it works.  The poison is gona, and I can collect my possessions. Once I am healed and ready, I shall rest again, and then embark upon my journey once more.<br>
<br>
Amber! My old stuffed cat! You comforted me often. I shall take you with me, though if anyone makes fun of me for it, I know not what I shall do. A childhood toy that has taken me through as much as you have though, I will not part with you easily. Not many know what comfort a stuffed animal can bring when trauma happens at a young age.<br>
<br>
It is good that the blankets are light here, and the clothes durable. I'm packed, and healed, now i shall once again rest. Then train in my skills, I shall, and after that, I can gather friends to aid me in the rescue of my brother. The old wards on this room still gleam bright...... I wonder if I would have survived had I not been the youngest and most protected.... Goodnight, Amber. Tomorrow a journey for me continues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=festerine>Festerine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Green Snake</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/15/03 11:56:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Awake again</span><hr size=1> Da voices.... speak to Fester from inside 'is 'ead.  <br>

As I continue my endless endeavor to help and assist the less fortunate then I, I sit by the main lift in Kelethin and read a communiqué that I just received from Velious.  It states that He fell in battle against the Frost Giants but was favored enough to receive a rez from a wandering cleric.  Blessed be Tunare!  The Shadow Knight lives to see another day.  <br>
<br>
But how sad it is, that He is not welcomed in my beautiful city.  To be able to show Him the lyrical beauty of my ever so peaceful home.  My eyes fill with tears…”How can it be?  How can a druid of gentle heart be captivated by one that is without remorse towards the druid race and the bunnies in Eastern Wastes?” he he..I smile. He loves to tease me. <br>
<br>
Later in the day, I packed my backpacks and ported to Shadow Haven to meet with Deknyr and help him with one of his many quests.  This sweet druid friend is so intent in completing the many quests he has at hand, he puts me to shame he he.  As I reach the bank to meet Dek, a cold shiver go up my spine as I have this strange feeling that someone is watching me.  I turn around but see nothing shady.  Is it Him?  I enter the bank and smile at Dek as he roughly hands over a backpack full of pelts.  “Come on girl, we don’t have all day!”<br>

The pain of that shock from Sonjaleah is emense. And yet, as much as I long to go hunt with them, I cannot. I have no path.<br>
<br>
As I last slept my dreams were troubled. Whispers of deception, and hatred towards me. Will I ever know why such things haunt me so? Why oh why do the whispers in my dreams lead to mistrust of my fellow dragons, and to mistrust of my friends? Is this the price I must pay for the knowledge of who it was that betrayed my family so long ago?<br>
<br>
I cling to Amber tighter. I must sleep and not have such troubled dreams. My fellow dragons are my frineds. They would not do any of the things that the whispers implied. They will not throw me to the wolves to survive on my own.<br>

Taking a sniff of the air I decide to go visit the old showerhose my family once ran. As I look around for the key to open the hidden building, I see a crystal holding a soft, comforting light. I look around to see who has left this obviously priceless item behind, but am all alone.<br>
      The crystal is a wonder. Looking in it, I forget all of my sorrows, all my pain, all my doubts. On the bottem, surpriseingly flat as opposed to all other sides I find a message there yet not.<br>
      Through this side, I see Sonjaleah. She whispers spells to protect a sleeping form. She brushes the little one's hair out of her face. At the sight of the face I jump slightly. It is my own, yet not. It is the face I see every day, yet I see not the hard lines of sorrow I usually see. Instead I see the face of a loved companion, A trustworthy friend. Suddenly I realize what I am looking at. A double vision of what occured thile I slept. I see what Sonjaleah saw, and what she did. Through this I am both her and this crystal, for it has recorded both sets of immages.<br>
      Sonjaleah moves again, and I resume steadily watching. She circles the room 3 times, a glowing light following her wake. After the third circle, the light blazes then disperses around the room, then fades so that it still exists, though invisible.<br>
      After circleing the room, Sonjaleah softly walks over to the bed.<br>
      &quot;Guard her well, Amber&quot; Sonjaleah murmers.<br>
      Without a word more, Sonjaleah lifts her arms, and fades away.<br>
      Amazed at this kind act, I get the things to clean myself in a daze. The crystal still firmly grasped in my hand. After cleaning myself thouroghly, I look into another face of the crystal.<br>
      Suddenly it's my 5th birthday again. I relive the happy moment before starting to weap from joy.<br>
      &quot;Sonjaleah, wherever you are at, I thank you,&quot; I softly murmer.<br>
      I hang the crystal around my neck by the cord it had hung from my window by. Now I am reminded that I am never truely alone. The Dragons are all with me in their own way. Ready to help if the neeed arises. Ready to watch over me and keep me safe, though subtly.<br>
       With this realization, I finish packing for my trip. I then continue on my journey, Amber in my bag, and the Dragoins in my heart. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balimal>Balimal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(2/1/03 9:41:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> shadow sneaks</span><hr size=1> The hard branch beneath me bites into my thigh and makes my butt start to go numb.

The Shadows start to creep over Kelethin, I sigh happily. A mischievous grin playing across my face as I search the unsuspecting crowd for easy prey.<br>
      Suddenly I spot a tall barbarian, wearing a blue kilt and powder blue breastplate.. and a fat coin purse. <br>
I slip quietly down from my perch onto the roof of The Faydark's champions guild. I jump to the wooden deck with a soft thunk. staying in the shadows I wait for him to pass by me. <br>
He struts by as if he is Tunare's gift to women. <br>
Tunare! such arrogance.. he deserves to be robbed! <br>
I say a silent prayer to Tunare that my Bounty will be plentiful. Then I strike. Quick as a snake I slit his coin purse free from his belt and quickly retreat to my hiding place in the branches to count my coins...<br>

Deknyr and I knew that Droga was a place of hell and that nothing good would come out of it.  But still we followed…<br>
<br>
Was it friendship for him that drove us into this hellish night?  Was it because we did not want him alone among the goblins?  He sounded so sure of Himself and we thought, with Him by our side, what could possibly go wrong.  <br>
<br>
His map was inaccurate; we got lost many times, evaded so many angry goblins and then the nightmare started.  We fell in a disguised hole on the ground and landed in a locked jail with more goblins lurking around.  <br>
<br>
Evac He said, Evac!  Sure, we were all camouflaged then but by casting the spell I was visible again and the enraged goblins battered me, pounded on me with gnashing teeth and I prayed to Tunare that we would be safe.  There was a ray of hope; we did escape but only to fall pray on another angry goblin.  Being already so weak, I died.<br>
<br>
I awoke partially naked in a land surprisingly beautiful and peaceful.  Birds singing everywhere.  Fields of green with flowers and trees.  <br>
<br>
“Where am I?  What am I doing here?”  I take a few steps and notice I am alone.  I call their names…Watchyur?  Deknyr?  No one answers.  Did I die? Is this where you go when you die?<br>
<br>
I hear the noise of a babbling brook nearby and I walk in its direction.  While bending down on its banks to quench my thirst, I hear a voice from far away saying to me…”I am sorry love” My eyes fill with tears.  Suddenly, I hear Ajlea whispering to me that all will be fine child.  Another flash of light and I am back in hell. I can feel my bruises, my pain.  I see Deknyr near by and also beloved Ajlea who brought me back to life.  And I sit to recover from the ordeal.<br>
<br>
I was told that after my death, He went back and He also died.  I called upon Lord Peraspera to assist us in this dangerous mission of retrieving the dead and he came as fast as he could.  Even our beloved Sonjaleah came to our aid.  <br>
<br>
The three of us died that frightful night. As for me, I died twice. I am very distressed that we got Lady Sonjaleah and Lord Peraspera involved in this incredible rescue. I thank the Blessed Tunare for giving me such good friends I can rely on because frankly, for the first time in my young life I saw no hope…No hope. <br>
 <br>
Sitting in my warm bed in Kelethin, nursing my wounds, I scribe the final words of this horrible event in my diary…Three times He told me He was sorry…<br>
