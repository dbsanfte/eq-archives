Opinion please...</span><hr size=1> I am curious who you think needs a symbol...<br>
<br>
I often cast my symbol on whomever (in the group/guild) asks.  But its becoming very expensive...  Thank god I have a few people who will occasionally throw a few peridots my way...  1 Peridot costs me about 12 plat...  and I use one every time I cast Symbol of Naltron.   <br>
<br>
Its really difficult for me to say no, to someone who feels they need a symbol to survive.  When in fact an extra 300 hp would only allow them to live 2 seconds longer.<br>
<br>
IMO I think that the only people who really need symbols are the main assist/tank the puller (often the same person) and any casters (necro, chanter, mage in particular cause they have so few hit points to begin with).<br>
<br>
This is just an opinion poll...  And will hopefully make everyone aware of what it costs a cleric to try and keep you alive...  ie:  If you are rezzed by a kind cleric...  Give him/her 5 peridots...  I for one, know that I would prefer that to cash!<br>
<br>
Not that I ever accept money from a guildmate for doing a rez.<br>

I'm a ranger and i never get hit unless i want to (in a controlled group situation that is). If i can do it, you can do it. Enchanters have to constantly deal with hits here and there mezzing mobs, and in many cases if the ench dies you all die.  The biggest waste is when a cleric wastes 3 symbols on the group casters and they never get hit or die anyway.

Many times a mob will beat on a player even if that player has cast no spells or done no damage...  ie. you are sitting in the background medding or look at the mob the wrong way (some mobs just dont do what they are supposed to, lol)<br>
<br>
In a situation like this, where you (as the cleric) notice that player C is taking a lot of unprevoked damage...  Shouldnt he/she get a symbol?  I think so.<br>
<br>
I frequently use Pinzarm on the full group when in outdoors zones or less dangerous situations.  After all Jasper only cost about 12 GP a piece as opposed to 12pp for a Dot...<br>
<br>
I generally try to have a stock of 2+ stacks of Dots and 3 or 4 stacks of jaspers on me...  Its not hard to go through a stack of gems in one night...  And even more in a raid situation.<br>

Opinion please...</span><hr size=1> I think most people will agree that using the higher buffs on the tanks and enchies is appropriate. After that, if there is mana and/or components available for the lower buffs for the rest of the group then that is great! I know, however, that I do not &quot;expect&quot; to get those buffs if I am not a tank or enchie in the group. If I get them, great...if not, then I am sure there is a reason (ie low on mana etc.)<br>
<br>
As far as the random unprovoked attack...well, in my mind that is just one of the fun risks of the game. If it happens to me, oh well. I would never expect a cleric to use up their expensive components keeping buffs on me just on the off chance that I may get a surprise aggro. But I also tend to be very laid back about dying...I mean, they are just pixels after all hehe. <br>
<br>
I do get annoyed by people that whine that they would not have died if they had been fully buffed or try to fault a group member for it. I think on the whole most clerics are gonna err on the side of over buffing. They have played this character for years for the whole purpose of saving people and I find it few and far between where a cleric is going to risk his group members. <br>
<br>
Well...my 2 cps there...seems more like 5pp maybe..got a little long winded there, hehe. Sorry folks..guess I need to lay off the coffee today!!!<br>

<br>
In total agreement that if an offensive caster draws his own heat,he's doing it wrong.(personally the 50+ zones hit so damn hard,for me it's all about avoiding aggro and doing my role period.<br>
Example:&quot;sorry Mr shaman,youre going to just have to slow the mob when it's at 85% health and not 95%,im not going to Tash any sooner).<br>

The reason I say this is we have near the lowest HPs of any in the game, and our lich spells are constantly draining us of life, so we need the buffer.  Many of our spells draw HUGE aggro. <br>
<br>
HOWEVER, we can cast our own shields.  As with yours, the lower one takes a jasper and the higher one takes a peridot.  This buff DAILY saves my ass and allows me to finish casting without being interrupted.  It's good for handling adds or sucking up an AE spell that would wipe out your low on life necro.  I'd say, throw a jasper symbol to your nec IF he doesn't have one of his own.  I wouldn't waste the peridot unless you were in one hellish place where the extra HPs would mean life or death. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

Also would it not be prudent to get a high CHA character, myself or Ozz and I'm sure there are more Chars here, to buy these in bulk for you and other clerics.

lets see here  i know for a fact that NECROs get DMG absorb Spells, AND have Harmshield...STEELSKIN for a necro requires a Jasper (i think it is, i have it and use it) good for about 250dmg...DIAMOND SKIN requires guess what  (PERIDOT) good for about 400dmg....if the wittle necro behaves in a manner that is not congurent to a long and prosporous life and requires a Symobol.. that wittle necro can give up one of his/her gems to have said protection.... now here comes the smack in the face.... ENCHANTERS!!!!!!!! u get rune spells  same as the Skin spells the necros have, and YES they require a gem.....if the Echie that can make tons of cash with the jewelcrafting is so inclined to beg every 5 seconds for a symbol, he/she might think about giving up one of the gems they have for RUNE to the chanter...<br>
<br>
hehe now dont go jumping down my throat..i know chanters are needed in many high lvl dungeons and playing in OS has taught me one think,  CHANTERS get Smacked around....Clerics get Phat Loots in Gems....and the NECRO is always looking for a group....<br>
<br>
You should gague how much DMG ppl are taking and base it on wether or not they are doing something stupid to take the dmg or if its just normal aggro,  but of the dmg i take is because i wasnt paying attention<br>
<br>
if the chanter is constantly getting beat up cause he/she is always mezzing adds, then sure the Chanter needs it... OR u need a new puller hehe<br>
<br>
Necros want the symbol so they can Lich themselves full of mana, but if u have a chanter in the group the necro shouldnt be using Lich line anyhow... but in the event u do have to lich, u can still get away without symbol...it just takes some mana disipline, u cant throw your big dots around,  only dot u will be using is the LEACH line witht he occasional LIFE TAP, because u will be pumping the cleric and and chanter with mana...<br>
<br>
Basically, all i can say is symbol everyone when u 1st group gague damage on all, then make a determination who REALLY needs it when the 1st symbol fades....<br>
<br>
Being a necro i cant afford DOTS 22pp EACH is a ball buster...so i stick with ARCH SHIELDING and STEELSKIN and it works wonders for me,because i have learned many a times that :<br>
<br>

<br>
Two hits by a decent mob is all the time it buys me.<br>
<br>
BUT a symobl by a cleric with the same gem, which I always have on me if they feel the need to have me provide one, lasts about an hour, obviously the better value.<br>
<br>
Chances are that if I am grouped with a cleric who wont buff me well, one of my sad little runes wont save me, cuz he prob doesnt heal much either.<br>
<br>
Its simple really, if the cleric cant afford to symbol the group, say so &quot;I dont have any stones, sorry&quot; - they are probably carrying some anyway.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/ufaewin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faewin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#993300>(3/1/02 4:24:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=145.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics and Non-Clerics...

This is assuming that you are pulling multis and mezzing.<br>
<br>
If not then the chanter may think twice about mezzing (I wouldnt but some may) especially if the tanks are struggling to gain aggro.  Most of the times Fae has died has been due to a mez break and the tanks being unable to gain aggro off me, sometimes it just doesnt seem to matter the mob wants youre ass :-(<br>
<br>
You say about Rune, but as Kehli says thats a one off and can get very expensive, personally I'm still using Rune 3, seems more cost effective to me, and I use it on top of symbol most of the time.<br>
<br>
Also I NEVER beg for a symbol, but usually get one in short order, either coz the cleric knows me or because after a while they see how much I getting smacked around the head :-(<br>
<br>
This of course is when I'm mezzing a lot, If not then no I dont need it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/uaaerosmellyfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aaero Smellyfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#993300>(3/3/02 3:33:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=145.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics and Non-Clerics...

Echies on the other hand only have the Rune, and hey 1 to 2 hits of no dmg is better than no protection what so ever,   but like i posted before......... if the echie is getting the beat down because he/she is constantly trying to contol mulit mob pulls.....YES the echie needs that extra HP....OR you need a new puller depending on the situation....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
and as for who needs....it is a factor of cost or the ? would not have been raised, who needs is a simple way of saying how do i cut down the cost of protecting 6 group members...if cost wasnt an issue symbol would be give out freely to any and all reguardless<br>
<br>
mana can be recouped easier than money...<br>
<br>
hehe dont take offense, cause im the same way, when there is no echie around i tend to ask for some HP buffs so i can Pump the cleric with mana, but am learning how to get around needing the extra HP buffs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
When symbol adds only a few HP it makes no difference. There's almost no purpose to symbol a tank, unless you are using complete heal. You should depend on that small buffer symbol provides. On tanks its acceptable. But for any caster, esspecially a chanter, its pointless. If the mob is attackling the caster, and you cant get it off that little extra exp wont make a difference. Even if it does the mob will then go onto the cleric for healing. Kill the cleric, and then the whole group is dead. Chanters have the best aggro control, and shouldnt get hit anyways, if they do(unlike other casters) they can get out of it fast.<br>
<br>
DOT's are spensive....shouldnt expect a symbol. Its not only a money waster, but a time waster as well.  I dont know how many groups ive joined where the cleric wants to fully buff everyone. So we sped 15 mins getting back mana. 30 mins later the buffs fall, gotta reset and med for 15 mins. By now the spawn you've broken is in full pop, and 90% of xp group deaths happen on breaking the spawn. So in all actuallity, buffing your group puts your chanter in more danger.<br>
<br>
The better way to do stuff..pull the whole camp, AoE slow it with that shaman you didnt group. Let the shaman tank(im serious), his pet can offtank another, and the group can kill a third. pretty easy. No cleric or chanter needed.<br>

<br>
I cant help it,all it takes is one resist to send the mob at you,even with 200+ CHA...<br>
<br>
I judge alot of clerics based on whether they symbol,but at 52 in KC or some crap,save the symbol or use a jasper because based on my level im not getting the resists.<br>
When i first tried Karnor's at 49th I scored massive resists,thus the aggro=Loading please wait..went back at 52,have no prob,don't need to blow a peridot.<br>
<br>
However,by that logic,at 52 i am on the low end in OS,please help me out with a symbol,I AM going to resist,and it will give the extra one or two rounds to stun and regain control. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=145.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=145.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=145.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=145.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=145.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.threadControl?topicID=145.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=145.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=145.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub65.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarr80492frm4">Announcements<option value="emarr80492frm2">General<option value="emarr80492frm3">Raids<option value="emarr80492frm5">Buy/Sell/Trade or better yet give it away!<option value="emarr80492frm10">/OOC and Funny Stories<option value="emarr80492frm11">CofK Members only<option value="emarr80492frm12">Officer Chat<option value="emarr80492frm13">Epics<option value="emarr80492frm14">The Hunt</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bemarr80492>Champions of Kaos</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm2>General</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.cofk.com">CoK Website</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
