I cannot find it within myself to respect that board any longer.  Dels has gone off the deep end lately.  Getting rid of sigs, Closing rants, then deleting it, throwing out the VS rotation, closing the Brell boards, opening them back up.<br>
<br>
It's insane.<br>
<br>
The trust of that board and the admin of it is completely gone.  I would love to have what this board once had back and I hope we can get it back.<br>

He did delete a post of mine that said he should break from those boards and turn over the admin of it to someone else.  He's most likely offended by what I said.  But what I said needed to be said.<br>
<br>
I still think he should turn over admin of that board to someone else.  He's lost any creditability he may have had at one time.  All his good deeds in the past have been wiped out by his poor actions in the past 48 hours.<br>

Just negative unconstructive garbage. I closed the board for a few hours, to see if people would get the message that throwing crap at me isn't helping their cause. Sadara had the first post on the board after it came up, and really wasn't anything but basically the same old mindless flames..<br>
<br>
Refusing to see anyone elses side of the argument just isnt good enough. I deleted rants because i found my RL being invaded by calls from the police. Until that happens to you, and it is YOUR responsibility, you have nothing to say regarding it. <p><b>The Many Faces of Blackthorne</b><br>

I'm serious when I say you need to step back.  Every action you make that effects that board and the people that use it is only making things worse.  You may not like that I have pointed out to you how wrong your actions have been.  I'm honestly sorry that you feel that way.  Stop deleting threads and boards and forums and closing things down.  It's not solving anything.  People need to be heard and you preventing that is causing more problems than it will ever solve!<br>
<br>
In the end, if you want me to respect that board, you will have to unban my account.  I schedule raids for Clan Spiritslammer and if the community chooses to continue to use your board, I will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> need</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> access to that board to post.  I will respect what the community chooses to do.  Not the actions of one individual that has chosen not to openly discuss his reasonings.<br>

<br>
I posted this in general..and the only comment from del was..yes the ends justify the means.  Del, if you are reading this....you have several quotes that you literally rip into sadara.  Not called for..yet you don't like it done to you.  I didn't see one thing wrong in sadara's comments, yet I saw some insulting ones from you.<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
I don't usually read the board on the weekend, but I had several people point me to some of the issues here so I thought i'd come take a peak. All I have to say is WOW and I sorta saw this coming with the way certain people were acting.<br>
<br>
Dels, I have a few things to say to you in response to what you have said in other threads. <br>
<br>
1) Yes we know...the rules we have here are NOT recognized by verant. Using this as your argument is obviously weak because neither is the rest of the reservation system, yet we still have it going. This was nothing new..and this was fully known at the time those mobs were put under reservation..so why this is even being used to back this decision is beyond me. <br>
<br>
2) You talk about your decision and how it was needed. You mention <br>
<br>
<br>
Quote: <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
And a decision needed to happen faster than a vote, where would probably get 1/10 of the total server population to be involved with in the first place.....<br>
Yes, well i made a decision it was better me in the middle than several hundred people all screaming at EACH other because reservations were getting stepped on..And since when do the votes of 400 people make the rules for everyone? <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So what is worse when it comes to the given argument that our 1/10th doesn't mean jack because it isn't even close to the majority of the whole server or your 1/5000th decision that is even further from it? <br>
<br>
3) Reasoning for the decision you mention was because other guilds were 'poised' to jump the reservation system. You mention if Trak gets out of hand, you will do the same thing. <br>
<br>
Quote: <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Possibly, if it gets out of hand like Venril did. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote: <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
That means, if even 1 guild says we arent observing your reservation, thats it. It is over. Wouldnt you rather have everything else we have reserved and have everyone get along, and lose maybe 1 mob which was ridiculous to reserve in the first place? Or would you rather not have scheduling at all. THATS what this is about <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is very sad as now we really know the recipe to manipulating the mods to do what we want. It's not hard to see that people are pushing for FFA now. You've set the precedence and have stated in so much you will be willing to make this type of decision again if you see the need arise. I don't particularly care for having a &quot;threat&quot; of work it out or we'll just do it anyway...hanging over my head. <br>
<br>
Remove the whole reservation system is what I move for if you mods are going to take this attitude and use these arguments to back yourself. If keeping this reservation system means for the rest of us to put up with the manipulation of mods and hidden agendas coming from god knows where, then I'm all for getting rid of them. It's a shame because I felt I wasn't greedy enough to want FFA, but I refuse to abide by rules where people are manipulated into them and these same people can change them at a whim. Funny..ppl sure will put down verant at the drop of a hat but will support their rules as the ten commandments that their FCFS system is the right thing and just couldn't possibly be set up for greed...hehe. The person who brought up the thread greed in raids forum /thumbs up.<br>
<br>
4) About this consensus thing:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote: <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
There is wide concensus that the planes and dragons need to be reserved. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I see a wide concensus that your decision was wrong but I do'nt suppose concensus matters in that regard enough to retract it. I suppose the few guilds and people you talked to in order to get the backing you felt for your decision, makes this justified. Even ganon said your mind was made up before you came to him and SR.<br>
<br>
5) On the subject of people accepting this:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote: <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
People will accept it (over time) just as they did Phinigel, or Velious. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't think so. You've changed my perspective and I'm about ready to scrap the whole thing, not just VS. I still have some people and guilds myself to talk to to get their opinion, we just may say screw it to these hidden agendas and tired mod(s) who are easily manipulated. Don't look for a formal announcement.<br>
<br>
<br>
6) What is good for the goose is good for the gander. The deleting, modifying, editing of threads and posts has been getting out of hand lately...alot of cases that &quot;you just dont' like it&quot; (this is not just del either) or &quot;this thread has served it's useful purpose&quot;. You among a few other mod(s) tell people they shouldn't question or insult yet I've seen this broken by a few mods repeatedly. I'm tired of hearing from mods..we are tired..we have too much work. You have had options...many..but you choose to ignore them. People have offered their time to give you a break and I know several even emailed you guys and some got responses of..we dont need any more..we are fine. People have offered having a voting topic group but it wasn't even entertained...would have released a lot of pressure off of you.<br>
<br>
Lastly, <br>

i may have done it the *wrong* way but the end goal is what matters. <br>

<br>
<br>
The ends NEVER justify the means.<br>
<br>
This post isn't designed to rip on del. It's only because del chose to be more vocal about his reasons and those reasons I'm questioning. <br>

And Delsonora's response? &quot;what they said&quot; when two people had written &quot;the ends DO justify the means&quot;. Your post merited a more dignified response than that. <p><b>Brinklith Rioghbhardan</b> - The Jester of Avalon<br>

I can only hope that Dels calms down and stops doing drastic stuff.  I'll give him a few days to unban my account there before doing anything about it.  I would like to give him the opportunity to come to his senses.<br>
<br>
This is very much out of hand, all of it and it all makes me very sad.<br>

____________________________________________________________<br>
Information regarding why i did what i did is already coming out, even on THIS board. Needless to say, i bet you feel differently about my actions when all the facts are known to you. But then again, maybe not. /shrug<br>
<br>
Credibility: Alright, then dont come back to the board then if you feel that way.. /shrug. Thats YOUR opinion. <br>
____________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Well that is the problem now is it not...  it helps for people to know WHY we are FORCE to take another opion without care or even asking any others.  You claim to have asked other Del... well I want NAMES. who?  you have made this into you are the one attacked well you took it on yourself. Welcome to the big boys club. <br>
<br>
Yes you credibility is shot to hell why you gave no reason, warning or choice to ANYONE but yourself.  this is proven repeatedly by you just stateing that you asked others but never saying WHO.  Then when the ONLY one who would benifit from it are questioned they all say WHY would we even care either way.<br>
<br>
So what is your answer... you have banned without cause repeatedly.  You lay blame at the feet other others but without cause. you claim the police call you about problems with the Rants. Well I have several RL friend who are just that Police. I took this matter to them and they LAUGHED. no claim there... ok maybe an email from a parent or something along that lines... but the police How and why would they call you?  You as Admin have no realy control other than to ban or delete post with such inflamtory comments in it... It is the poster they should be calling &quot;qouted&quot; from my friends.<br>
<br>
So next excuse if you would please.<br>
<br>
Thanks for playing,<br>

<br>
Sorry Dels, Sadara hardly qualifies as a card carrying hothead.  I do find it interesting that shouts from one side are ignorant or disruptive, but certain other people can post trolling in basic support of the current decision and that is acceptable.  Odd that, it really doesn't help cool tempers.<br>
<br>
Dels, I respect you in general, but honestly... you should have known that this action would have these consequences.  Being upset that you're the target is a tad silly.  Sillier when you'd have been better served coming to the Brell community (not leaders of certain guilds) and saying &quot;guild x has announced they will no longer honor reservations.&quot;  Let the community figure out how to handle that.<br>

Therein lies the problem and confirms my suspicions about all of your recent actions. Neither you nor Minute are *our* leaders! Just where do you get off on presuming this position? Leader of what? Brell? Brell Boards?<br>

I could have a lot of respect for someone who ran a message board for the good of the community. I can have no respect for someone who does it merely to attain a position of prominence amongst their peers. <br>

And now to the reason I'm posting Kelteh.... Are you so young or do you not pay any attention to the current state of the world? The threats made on the BS.net board will get people in a total uproar. I personally know a 10 year old that is being prosecuted for making those threats. Can't say that they even understand why there was a problem. Your line... &quot;I bequeath unto you your new title; &quot;Delsonora the Invertebrate&quot; is the biggest piece of Crap I've seen yet. NO ONE should be using these boards that doesn't have the maturity to know that those comments were out of line in todays society. Also, NO ONE should have to put up with having the police call them over it. Rants should have been killed long before that no usefull infomation had come out of there in months. <br>
