Meaning this system will be used mainly (95% + of the time) for games.  Mostly first person shooters (Half life/unreal/Soldier of Fortune style...), some RPG's (Diablo II/Revenant style) and a big part would be Online RPG (Everquest).  These are older games...  However I enjoy games in that style.<br>
<br>
The hardware has been researched and selected...  Due to budget vs performance consideration I have decided on the following:<br>
<br>
AMD Athlon XP 1800+<br>
1 GHz DDR Ram<br>
AOpen AK77ProA Mainboard<br>
GeForce 2 -64 MB DDR<br>
Western Digital 7200RPM, ATA 100 40 GB Hard Drive<br>
plus the other basic componants.<br>
<br>
However I am still debating which OS to use.<br>
<br>
I am putting 1 GB of DDR RAM in the machine...  And have heard from several sources that Windows 98 SE is the best gaming platform.  However, I seem to recall that there are limitations to the amount of RAM that Windows can actually take advantage of.<br>
<br>
Which OS would you recommend?  I assume for compatibility reasons, that Microsoft will be required...  <br>
<br>
But Should I go Win 98SE, Win ME, or Win XP?<br>

<br>
So 2000 and XP are crossed off the list.<br>
<br>
98 is my first choice...  But its the memory issue that worries me.  ME might be the solution...  I'll just have to patch the hell out of it and Gohst it before I start installing stuff...<br>

The only tricky thing is finding XP drivers that support DirectX 8+.  But even that wasn't too tough.  I wouldn't use 2000, it pretty much sucks for gaming.  So with that in mind XP is pretty much the only one left.<br>

<br>
So there is no reason for me not to...  except the money...  which is not an issue in this matter... <br>
<br>
As for mainboards...  I've had very good success with the various AOpen and Tyan motherboards I have used in the past.  They are good boards.  <br>
<br>
I've been using lots of AOpen stuff (mainboard, network and video cards for the past 4 years or so.  I like em...  <br>
<br>
Mainboards (add on cards like sound, network, modem and  video) are pretty much the only thing that AOpen makes for themselves...  they use rebadged Ricoh CDR-RWs and Logitech Mice...  Havent figured out any of the other peripherals yet.....  But hey.  Quality stuff at a good price.<br>

You can check out latest issues of Computer Gaming World, PC gamer, and computer gaming for example.  CGW cites choices for different price ranges of boxes every month.   See p 106, Mar 2002.<br>
CGW has an on line spot (gamespot.com - I think) that will have more reviews and stuff.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, the solid choice for operating system on any rig is XP Home edition.  There is discussion about Athlon vs Pentium, but the only OS chosen is XP.  (Win2K, on the other hand, is considered a poor choice for gamers.)   XP is much more stable than 95-98-Me; and proved to be very compatible with a wide range of high performance games.   In addition, because of compatibility  mode, it turns out to be MORE compatible with very old games - even many DOS games - than other Windows versions.  It is true that XP has a lot of stuff set up that games dont need --- but it also has a very nice configuration tool that allows you to turn it all off.   We have XP on one and Me on another and there is no noticeable difference.    If anything I think I zone a bit faster.  (We have identical 1.6 ghz Dell boxes with 512 mb.)<br>
<br>
I might also note that the recommendation on the highest end power rig this month is still for only 512 mb - and that for a system that costs US$ 3K+.  I think getting a MB that takes 1 GB would last quite a while.  The problem is (which has also been mentioned in the rags frequently) that even if you  buy the BEST POSSIBLE system now, in 2 years it will be woefully out of date anyway.   So trying to build for a machine that will last more than that is pretty much impossible.<br>
<br>
I think Verant/Sony made a very risky choice to push the tech specs well ahead.  Despite the dismay I have at, for example, our friend Lowky being shut out of EQ, objectively I have to admit that this decision may allow them to extend the life of EQ considerably - maybe a couple more years.  At that point we are going to have to retool anyway.  (I just wish they had somehow managed a backward compatibility of some sort, but having done programming myself it is far from unreasonable to me that it just wasn't feasible.)<br>
<br>
The biggest choice in any system IMHO is the video card.  We are cheap and have Geforce2 mx-400.   The choice in vogue for high end gaming is Geforce3Ti 500.<br>
<br>
Good luck...<br>
