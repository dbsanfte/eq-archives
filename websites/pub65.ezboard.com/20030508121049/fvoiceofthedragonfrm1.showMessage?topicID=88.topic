I halt in the moonlight, searching for a place to hide.  She saw me, she had to have.  I look down at my armor, shining brightly in the moonlight.  What am I to do?  I breathlessly creep to a nearby shrub, and there I wait, hidden from view.  Only a slight gleam from my sword reveals my presence.<br>
<br>
The damp grass is brushing against my face, testing my every capability to hide.  As I watch the trees, I see without a doubt the slim shape begin to slip in and out of vision...<br>
<br>
The figure startles, from what I know not.  She begins to flee silently into the east.  What startled her? Protect her, I must...<br>
<br>
As I begin my search of her hiding place the silence is broken by an ear splitting screech that rips through the night followed by a Whisper that can only be made by one creature... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dureln>Dureln</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Green Snake</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(11/15/02 10:20:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whispering (roleplay)</span><hr size=1> I materialize atop of the ancient spires in the dark dense forest, following rumors of a nameless fear.  In an effort to combat the malevolent darkness, I conjure a halo of light.  As it radiates from in my hand, it pierces the darkness to revile countless demons surrounding me!! I startle!! And then realize that they are only the shadows of the trees.  I take a breath of relief.<br>
<br>
But then, I hear a gasp, and a rustle of underbrush from behind me!  My familiar Yaps and dives under the confines of my robes for protection as i snap around to catch a glimpse of what was there only to find more shadows.<br>
<br>
Again in nearly the same area I hear another rustle in the foliage and from within the forest a gleam of steel reflecting the light of my halo can be seen.  Someone is there.  And they're armed.  In Panic!! I channel from within me all the arcane powers and prepare to unleash the most devastating blast a wizard of my caliber can bear to destroy the intruder!!  BUT!! My concentration is broken by a terrifying cry emanating from the other end of the forest.  It cuts through my heart as a knife through soft butter.  It is that for which I came.  The rumors are true.  Something IS here.<br>
<br>
I am petrified with fear.  Then I hear a voice whisper to me and I have no other choice than to listen...<br>

 <br>
   ..I was a child of Kelethin....the youngest of four boys to a father who was cold...angry...and a drunkard.  Ne'er was there a time when he did not have an ale in his hand.  He would come home from the Tavern late at night-and as was normal, angry.  And he lashed out..violently..he would sting the child with words, and with hands, and with whips or belts..I could not do anything to stop it.  Mother tried to soften the blows with kind words later, but the pain ne'er did leave.  I ne'er knew a kind word from him, and the gentle touch of Love from him was as alien as our Dark Brethren of Neriak.  <br>
 <br>
  I tried...I made my way through schooling...excelling in Elven Historical Studies...Vocal Stylings...Norrathian Geography...none of it pleased him.  I acted in plays, surpassed anything anyone in the family had done...nothing was sufficient.  All I ever wanted was to make him proud of me....<br>
 <br>
   He killed himself with drink.  The doctor didst say his body gave out.  And at his burial I sang a hymn to Tunare.<br>
   Shortly thereafter, my mother's light expired.  Though he was often cruel to me, he loved her, and she died of a broken heart.  And at her burial I sang a hymn to Tunare.<br>
 <br>
  <br>
      My brothers scattered.  To where I know not.  I took up the lessons of Maesyn and learned the ways of the Faydark Champions.  When I was of age, I ventured into the Faydark to do battle..first with the Orcs, and then anything which threatened me.  I took risks some people might not otherwise, for I do not fear.  Not for mineself.<br>
 <br>
   My name is Peraspera Adastra.  It means Through the Thorns, To the Stars.  A looser translation would be go through Hell to reach the Promised Land.<br>
 I have been through Hell.  And Im seeking that Star.<br>
 I fight a life against a Ghost who hits me still.<br>
 I strive with everything within my Soul to please a man dead 6 long years.<br>
 I fight against a Ghost that only I can see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 ...All I e'er wanted was to make thee proud, Father..Why must you hit me?  No daddy, no............<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
  <br>
  ...a frightened scream breaks me from mine somber reminiscance.  A young elf in trouble from the horrors which abound here at night.  I raise my sword in Defiance to join the fray.....<br>
 <br>
  ..Put the Ghost away for now, Pera...He'll be back soon enough, but for now, keep thy mind on the task at hand.  Somebody needs help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=selicatiren@voiceofthedragon>Selicatiren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Green Snake</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/23/02 12:41:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My Rescuer</span><hr size=1> His sword slashes towards me and terrified I scream.

....concentrating harder the wind pulls at my dress scattering my hair in all directions - I begin to turn - my eyes turn black........around and around till...falling to my knees - grabbing at my throat as if someone was strangling me ....all that is heard is my scream - gasping &quot;HOW CAN THIS BE&quot;!<br>
<br>
Rising to my feet I run through the forest paying no mind to my friends as I cross them on the path.  Tears streaming down my cheeks.  Arriving at my home I throw open the doors - hurrying down the hall to the warm fire awaiting..I then crumble - my mind fragmented - the only sound other than the crackle of the burning wood is my tears crying out...alone alone alone alone...... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sonjaleah>Sonjaleah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of Scale</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/27/02 3:13:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whispering (roleplay)</span><hr size=1> Morning light streams in from the window above my bed.

Swinging my legs over the side of the bed..my feet touch the cold floor.  To lost in my thoughts to notice the sleeping form beside me rolls over - eyes watching me quietly.<br>

   The morning woke painfully.  Dreadfully so.<br>
 <br>
 Light streaming in through a window..hurting his eyes.<br>
 He shut them tightly, trying to hide from the pain..from<br>
 the memories...<br>
 <br>
  He had done something he did not ever do.  He had<br>
 imbibed ale.  And a lot of it..  It was always tough this<br>
 time of year to block out the memories which haunted<br>
 him.  So he chose to drown them this night instead.<br>
 <br>
   ..he had vague recollections of the night.  A lot of drinks.  Sitting quietly in a corner booth, drowning any conscious thoughts he might have otherwise had.  And there was a woman...He could barely remember..All a blur..everything so foggy.....<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   And thats when he took notice of where he was.<br>
 He was in a bed.  And it was not his.  Nay, he had not seen his own bed in months.  The rustling sound next to him jogged his memory...he had taken her home.  What may or may not have happened was lost to the night.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  He watched her walk across the room nude.<br>
 <br>
  Why, Tunare, Why?  I have shamed this poor woman.<br>
 I have taken advantage of the situation.  Or was it I who was taken advantage of?  So much ale...so little thought...so much light.....so very naked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whispurrwillowind>WhispurrWillowind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Green Snake</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/30/02 7:16:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The elusive toes...</span><hr size=1> We were all in the Great Divide, Watchyur, Deknyr, Darksider and a few more friends, hunting giants for their elusive toes.  Not the normal kind I must say, but the painted ones, as described by Deknyr (we were told he has something for painted toes).  <br>
<br>
After searching without success, we started to think that maybe the  giants were all afflicted with frostbite and their toes fell off.  It was only after tremendous bravery and unrelentless perseverance that we were able to salvage a few toes for Dek's collection.  <br>
<br>
Later on in the night, during a snow storm, Peraspera joined us and offered assistance in helping us with a frontal attack of the fort.  He seemed troubled in some way, his mind elsewhere.  Unfortunately, we were all plagued with fatigue and exaustion from the earlier battles and opted for an early port to Nexus.  <br>
<br>
Deknyr went back home with his treasure of toes. Watchyur made a quick stop to the Shadow Heaven bar and I tagged along, tired, weary but ready for a cold one.<br>
<br>
I was told that Peraspera went back to the frozen land to hunt Walruses in solitude.  May Tunare bless him with courage and peace.<br>

My brother Toter has been taken against his will to the Plane of Hate. However I am still no match for the beasts there. To find my brother I must find a group of six allies and search again on this trail. I wonder who in this inn would help me? Do I have to go to another place to find aid? and what about that kitty? why did he leave me to pay the bill on my own? <br>
   Also... Where did that ranger that once helped me go? His name I barely remember. It was... Per..aspera...Ad.......astra! Peraspera Adastra! Where did he go? I had assumed that he would help me, though I suppose I might have received aid had I not been drunk, and had I not neglected to tell him why I quest on.<br>
   Oh well, I believe that I shall go back to the ruins of my once prosperous home in Kelethin, and gather what little remains. I shall also go to my guild there and get some new spells. For soon I shall be able to use them!<br>
   On my way, for the sun shines, and I have to pass through Kithicor Forest on my way to the West Commons so that I may use the boat in freeport to venture on, no matter WHAT the odds against me are.

Why do I do this? I have many things to do.  Dragons to protect.  Could it be they were right? the gods do not lie - but it can't be but I do feel a warming of my heart.<br>

Alone is he, slumped over numerous empty glasses of unknown libation.  He looks sad though I have seen him slay with tremendous courage so many foes, he now looks so vulnerable, so exposed.<br>
<br>
Hesitantly, I approach Him, not knowing what to say.  I notice his armour looks scorched from one of my blasts and I lower my head in discuss at my inability to be more accurate in my DD.  Still groggy from the intake of ale, I slowly reach the empty stool next to him and sit silently while he chews on batwing crunchies.  I reach out to one of his rough but gentle hands and gently squeeze it to show that I care and that I am sorry for the burns.  Our eyes meet.  He looks so tired…so alone. I’m alone… My heart misses a beat.  He smiles…<br>

   As quietly as I couldst, I crept from the house without a sound.  Making my way to the frozen lands of Velious, I again set upon the task of bettering myself.  Honing my skills in battle.  I sought solitude.  I sought quiet.<br>
   <br>
  I sought a peace I hadst never known.<br>
 <br>
   I laid waste to the beasts which stood before me.  A lifetime of anger so pent up and hidden comes forth during these times....I lash out with a fury I otherwise do not show.  For all the pain I have felt, I deliver it unto the beasts.  So wrapped in my own thoughts I do not even feel the eyes upon me....but my mind lingers upon the events of the last day.<br>
 <br>
  ...fuzzy images return to me as I swing my blade again and again...A woman, touching my hand at the bar...Another who matched me drink for drink...and waking up as I did...<br>
 <br>
  ...another beast falls to my savagery....<br>
 <br>
 ...Pera, thou dost know better...All thou hast ever known is pain...the pain of the physical, the pain of the mental..the pain of loss and suffering...such enduring pain...the ghosts which haunted him still...all so much pain.........So much solitude...<br>
 <br>
    ..there were some days when he felt he could not stand it...The thoughts of wandering into the forest and laying down to die stayed with him...to end the pain....<br>
..always so very alone..................<br>
 <br>
  ... he wandered back to his Solitude Tree to rest but for a moment before once again raising his sword in battle...he spotted them..faint amidst the snow which didst fall, but to an experienced tracker, evident nonetheless...<br>
 <br>
  ..footprints, and fresh, which didst not belong to him, nor to any of the prety which he fought...<br>
 ..petite...female, soft indent which spoke of elven blood.<br>
no more than 30 minutes old...and yet he had heard nothing.  Perhaps it was the ringing in his ears which blocked the sound, or perhaps he was so lost in his own thoughts he mistook it for the wind...but they were there.  As plain as the sunrise on the Bridge of Karana.<br>
 <br>
  Footprints.  A woman was nearby.  Gone?  Watching?<br>
 He knew not, but he followed them..and they led on................... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=88.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=88.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=88.topic&start=61&stop=71>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=88.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=88.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=88.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.threadControl?topicID=88.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=88.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=88.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub65.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="voiceofthedragonfrm8">The Courtyard<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm1">In a Low Voice <option value="voiceofthedragonfrm5">On the Prowl<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm7">For Glory and Power<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm3">Dragon Tales<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm10">Charter<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm4">Hatchlings<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm2">The Hoard<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm6">By Our Talons Made<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm9">Casting Bones<option value="voiceofthedragonfrm11">Epics</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon>Voice of the Dragon</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/fvoiceofthedragonfrm1>In a Low Voice </a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
