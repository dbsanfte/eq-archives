We lived in a small room above a tavern, and the dancing skeletons cared for me as my mother cleaned and slaved, ranting all the while about ‘that man’.<br><br>That man would have been my father, my protector, my guardian against her flashing temper, and leather belt. He would have been, but he had a family, and a daughter at home.  Oh how I longed for him to come for me, to take me to his fine home in Erudin. I knew he would love me, and we would walk together in the clean quiet streets of Erudin, take the boat to Erud's Crossing to fish and swim. He would talk to me, and teach me his ways of jewelcraft and of enchanting metals, how to charm people and animals.  I knew I would entertain him with my clever ways, my keen eye, and I would be his dream.<br><br>The years soon robbed me of this delusion.  I was soon to learn he had a daughter he adored, that he pampered her with lovely clothes, jems and precious books.  He taught her and she followed in his path as enchantress of Quellious.  Her name was Kehli, and how I despised her. She kept him from me, and before I could find him and make him see how strong I was, how well I had grown, and how his superior Erudite genes had molded me, before I could make him love me - he was killed in the forests of Kithicor.<br><br>I was devastated by the loss, although the news was long in reaching me.  By the time I had caught the peasant walking in the dark Tox forest and convinced him to talk (heh heh heh) young Kehli had been sent out into the world and her whereabouts were unknown.  The beloved father I had yet to meet was cold in his crypt, never to know me.  In my rage I killed the peasant and found myself a new calling.  I scraped the flesh from his bones and summoned a companion.  My new family, an undead servant, loyal only to me!<br><br>What incredible freedom!!!  I slaughtered at will in the gardens of Paineel, but I soon tired of the undeads.  I found great satisfaction torturing the furry beasts of the Warrens, and the laughable cats of Kerra!  I drank their milk while I ate their fish and played with their dolls.  I giggled as my pet shredded the flesh from them. <br><br>Silly cats! I drew the life from them to heal myself, and how I laughed!<br><br>When bored again, as I often was, I left Paineel.  I did not seek out my mother to bid her farewell as she was so obsessed now in her hate of my father (and yet despairing his passing) she was incoherent. <br><br>I traveled to many distant and exotic places, I traveled the Qeynos underground, Freeport, the Karanas, the Commons, North Ro, and Oasis, to Lake of Ill Omen, and Kurn's Tower.  I searched and yet found no contentment.  The need in me was great, but I could put no name to the desire that drove me.<br><br>As I wandered, I heard snippets of news about my sibling.  She was successful, it would seem, with a constant group of companions.  She had married. She was adventuring in areas I still didnt dare enter. The darkness in me grew with each season.  I could almost hear the chatter of her companions as I sat in the darkness of Paludal Caverns, the stench of rot high in my throat, the clatter of bones my only company.<br><br>Ahhh the sting of jealousy!<br><br>On a sunny afternoon in Freeport, I sought out her husband, eager to see what sort of slime would have her. He was unaware as I took measure of him, and take measure I did.  What a handsome man! I was taken by his dark good looks, so rare in the east, the high smooth forehead, the muscular frame.  I shivered in envy.  He would be mine, as would all she had achieved!  He rebuffs me, pretending fealty to her - but I will not be thwarted by him, or anyone.<br><br>I set out to master the trades, baking and pottery were easy, then I turned to brewing.  I began my studies of fletching and smithing.  I will be a master!<br><br>I managed to obtain more than serviceable gear – some of it from my connection to my hated sister.  It seemed she was aware of me, and felt sorry for me.  I allowed her to pity me, savoring the irony.  I knew that the hand me down gear she had people pass on to me would one day let me catch her in power and then, only then, would I destroy her!<br><br><br> <p><HTML><BODY><a Target="_top" href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb.html" ><img src="http://ezb.flamingtext.com/ezb/2002/04/12/flamingtext_com_1018633574_6998.jpg" border=0 alt="Image by FlamingText.com"></a><br>Image by <a href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb2.html">FlamingText.com</a></BODY></HTML></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub65.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarr80492frm4">Announcements<option value="emarr80492frm2">General<option value="emarr80492frm3">Raids<option value="emarr80492frm5">Buy/Sell/Trade or better yet give it away!<option value="emarr80492frm10">/OOC and Funny Stories<option value="emarr80492frm11">CofK Members only<option value="emarr80492frm12">Officer Chat<option value="emarr80492frm13">Epics<option value="emarr80492frm14">The Hunt<option value="emarr80492frm15">Miscellaneous Quests<option value="emarr80492frm16">/Roleplay</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bemarr80492>Champions of Kaos</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.cofk.com">CoK Website</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
