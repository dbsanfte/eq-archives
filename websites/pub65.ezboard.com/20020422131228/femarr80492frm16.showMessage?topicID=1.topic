They named her Kehli, and she was as clever and smart as she was lovely.<br>
<br>
When Kehli was just blossoming into womanhood, her peaceful life of contemplation and study was destroyed.<br>
<br>
Her parents, on vacation in lovely Kithicor Forest, were brutally killed by wandering undeads.  Kehli was suddenly homeless, alone in all of Norrath.<br>
<br>
She was soon befriended by a lovely halfling Lucyokk, and her bizarre sidekicks, Ndrokk the gnome, and Kogginn the dwarf.<br>
<br>
Despite being taught at an early age to avoid the lesser races, she came to love and trust her new companions as family (except the drawf - NEVER trust a DWARF!)<br>
<br>
She travelled all over Norrath, calling nowhere home, as the lovely city of Erudin held such painful memories.  On her journeys, she met many incredible people.<br>
<br>
The dashing bad ass Goht, the wise Kordail, the ugly-yet-appealing Styrogur and his lovely Styrona.<br>
<br>
The magnetic Thornfist, the wickedly skilled Zoldarf, the enigmatic Salornx, the talented Ozz and the charming couple of Mac and Lelana.....so many memories of more people than she can list.....<br>
<br>
Then it happened one day in Oasis, she met Braydin Firecaster, an unparallelled specimen of Erudite manliness... the wit! the looks! the adorable mini earth elemental - she was smitten!<br>
<br>
They were wed, with many of their dearest friends in attendance, and all was well, or was it????<br>
<br>
Incredibly, Kehli's father had strayed from his vows! He had fathered a bastard daugher with a voluptious and evil temptress in Paineel.  This sister grew twisted and bitter under the constant tutelage of her mother.  She was named Baddream, and her only goal in life is to out do her hated pampered sibling!<br>
<br>
Baddream grew up the hard way, playing in the dark warrens with the bones of the playmates she slew as she grew weary of them.  She had no group, no powerful benefactors to see her into her teens, her twenties, she did it the hard way - alone.  Sure there were pickups, some went well, many left her naked and afraid far from home.  She was last seen being shredded by guards in High Hold while screaming &quot; I hate you KEHLI!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
What does her future hold? <p><HTML><BODY>

It was the same dream again, of pursuit by a faceless foe all in black.  For some time now she had tried to beleive it was just the trauma of the carnage in Burning Woods, the many narrow escapes from Chardok and Maiden's Eye.  The evil of the things she had seen must be the same evil chasing her in her dreams.<br>
<br>
She was restless now, and sleep eluded her.  She paced anxiously in the modest accommodations in North Freeport.  She found the time apart from her beloved difficult, but she understood his need to expore the arcane in places she could not travel.  He would not be back this day, and she felt very much alone.<br>
<br>
A sudden scratching at her door startled her, and she swore softly in Erudite as she approached the door.<br>
<br>
It wasnt quite dawn, and the hall was dark as she opened the door.  In the dimness she saw a figure in a black robe  - and for a heartstopping instant, she could see no face!<br>
<br>
Despite her powers, her vast experience with terrifying monsters , she stepped back, and gasped aloud.<br>
<br>
The faceless spectre stepped into her room and the light hit the smirking face of her half sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nervous Kehli?&quot; she whispered, smiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just startled Dream, I.. I just woke up&quot; Kehli was angry now with the way she was behaving.  She was no tender child to shy away from shadows! She was a mature woman, with many seasons of hunting dangerous creatures!<br>
<br>
&quot; I brought your breakfast &quot; she placed a tray on the small table.<br>
<br>
Instead of being pleased with the gesture, Kehli was suddenly uneasy.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Wha ... ahem.. what is it?&quot; she wanted Dream to go, she suddenly felt naked and trapped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just some pie, it wont bite you&quot;  she was grinning now, a strange gleam in her eyes.  She chuckled as she walked to the door, shaking her head.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Have a nice day&quot; she whispered, as she left the room without looking back, shutting the door softly behind her.  <br>
<br>
Kehli began to shake, and crossed the room swiftly and bolted the door.  She looked at the tray on her table and felt the bile rise in her throat.<br>
<br>
She had wanted to help her sister. Kehli had initiated the contact between them, and since Dream had joined the Champions of Kaos there had been only cordial conversation between them.<br>
<br>
Why was she suddenly so very afraid? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.showNextMessage?topicID=1.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.emailToFriend?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.threadControl?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub65.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarr80492frm4">Announcements<option value="emarr80492frm2">General<option value="emarr80492frm3">Raids<option value="emarr80492frm5">Buy/Sell/Trade or better yet give it away!<option value="emarr80492frm10">/OOC and Funny Stories<option value="emarr80492frm11">CofK Members only<option value="emarr80492frm12">Officer Chat<option value="emarr80492frm13">Epics<option value="emarr80492frm14">The Hunt<option value="emarr80492frm15">Miscellaneous Quests<option value="emarr80492frm16">/Roleplay</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bemarr80492>Champions of Kaos</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub65.ezboard.com/femarr80492frm16>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.cofk.com">CoK Website</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
