Seems I logged in today and discovered that Dianisis was removed from the guild.  Not only was he guild removed, but access to the boards changed with not so much as a word from anyone in the guild.  Even though you have my email address.  <br>
<br>
What kind of nonsence have you turned this family into?  Removing people without telling them?  Is the power trip so great?  Your heads so full?  Having not been on over the past months I've no clue as to what you've all done to each other.  And frankly at this point, no interest.<br>
<br>
Whisper of the Dragon was once a guild with honor, enjoyed br friends.  Now it seems full of arrogant, insolent youths who barely know their way around crushbone, let alone all that Norrath has to offer.  Tell me exactly what offened you that I did?  Had RL issues to handle?  Ah yes...thats a wonderful reason for guild removal.  <br>
<br>
Well instead of parting friends, I see the writing dictates our relationship will turn to the sour end of the spectrum.  Making enemies isn't smart.<br>

<br>
  Events in the recent time that we all have been playing EverQuest have cause many emotions to run high.  Those of us that have been here, and listening, are well aware of this.  Those of us that play this game are often playing it to rid ourselves of the real life emotions that threaten to overwhelm us in our real lives.  Whisper of the Dragon has always been a family guild, where real life comes first, and your own priorities are the guild's priorities.  I wish for this to continue, for us to be a guild that can support everyone's dynamic lifestyle's and playing technique's.<br>
<br>
  EverQuest is an escape to many of us.  When it no longer fulfills the requirements of being that escape, most people leave.  It begins to influence our real lives.  It begins to influence our emotions outside the computer screen.  For some, they cry.  For others, they get pissed.  And yet others, find amusement from it.  Recently, I think the first two are more of the emotions influencing a lot of our members, as well as our leadership.<br>
<br>
  If you are unaware of what happened, let me tell you my side of the story, and this is to the members so that they can see what I, their Guild Leader, am currently thinking.  Dragons, if you'd like to discuss this more with me, let us do it in private, where you can call me all the dirty names you want, but please, let's not air out our dirty laundry in public.<br>
<br>
  Recently, I reinvited a long time friend of mine back to the guild.  Toter Bunches, once an officer of this guild, and also a founding member, was invited by me, with a personal invitation to join our family.  Upon my return from real life obligations, I found out he had been removed, on the same day that I invited him.  I wanted to know what happened, so I discussed the events with both parties (the removing officer, as well as Toter himself).  Obviously there were discrepencies.  The facts remain that 1) Toter had been asked who he was, as the opposing officer feared it may have been Balamil, whom that officer disliked, and Balamil had been known to play Toter in the past.  Toter, without revealing a real life name, told this officer that he was 'The Toter, founder/creater/leveler of Toter'.  The officer felt that this answer was not complete, and again, asked Toter who he was.  Toter, feeling that the answer was sufficient, replied that he had answered.  With the officer feeling like he was being treated as a smart ass, he removed Toter.  It is true that another snide comment was made, from Toter, to the officer.  When this comment was made is yet to be answered.  One account claims it was before Toter's removal, another account claims it was after his removal.  Being that this was in tells - there were no witnesses to answer the question.  Seeing as how I judged it all a misunderstanding, I reinvited Toter giving him my apologies for a misunderstanding.  The officer on the matter was angered with me for going against him and believing a member over an officer, and claimed that I should support him.  While that is true that I consider the officers to be very trust worthy, I do not discredit the testimonies of the members.  Not long after Toter's re-invitation, I camped out for the evening to accomodate some guests in real life.  After the guests had gone home, I relogged, and found that Toter had been removed again.  At this point, I felt that the officer had stepped out of bounds by going against the chain of command twice.  Is this a power trip on my part? No - I simply felt that if he could not maintain a respect for my wishes in retaining a member, then how could I trust him to maintain my wishes in a guild event or other such action.  It is because of this that I removed Laedil/Tangisto.<br>
<br>
  During this same time, Ajlea removed all of her known characters from the guild, claiming that she was no longer wanted in our guild.  While I sympathize that she feels this way, in no way have I ever felt like I made her un welcome.  Seeing as how Ajlea had removed herself from Leadership, Officership, and Membership, I removed her Administrative privelages on the message boards since she no longer wished to be with us.  Harsh, yes.  I'm aware of that.  However, I don't feel that someone who no longer wishes to be a member in this guild should have the ability to delete and edit posts at her own choosing.  This is why I removed her privelages.  As for the webpage, we will no longer be using www.whisperofthedragon.com as it is being funded by a non member.  Dureln, Lerdari, and myself will be creating and furnishing the guild with our own website.<br>
<br>
  Lastly, I made a mental check with myself of those that I still felt were a member of this family.  I went through the guild roster and removed those people that have distanced themselves from our own culture.  Of these were Lady Eli, playing a ranger on our server, Dianisis, whom we have not seen in months, and the rest of Tangisto/Laedil's characters.  Was this cold hearted of me? Maybe.  However, Dianisis, Laedil, and Lady Eli's characters all had officer status, and I did not feel that I wanted these members to be representing our guild as officers, and there for removed them.  If any of you have problems with this, let's discuss it in private.  It is not something for everyone to hear.<br>
<br>
  If you all feel that I have let the power of being GL go to my head, so be it.  But know that you are wrong.  I've done what I've felt has been needed to improve the relationships in our family.  Ajlea - you say that it's now full of people who act like enemies? Of the members in the guild, no one is saying negative things.  These comments have been from participants outside of the guild.  So, it seems our 'family' isn't so inhospitable.  <br>
<br>
  I will not post anything else on this topic in open forums.  If you have a problem with something I've done, and feel that further explaining is needed, then by all means, contact me in private, but I will not post anything else regarding this topic, and I suggest you don't either.<br>

<br>
The acts that you have perpetrated against Ajlea and Laedil are deplorable at best. Ajlea gave everything to the guild that she could, even though the guild was being used by others as a farm team for raid guilds.<br>
<br>
When people said that she was not raiding enough, she made everyone put their money where their mouths were. After one weekend we could not get enough to raid Crushbone. <br>
<br>
I must bring into question those of you that still wear the tag knowing how she has been treated. Gwapa will be removing all her other characters, and I will be removing my monk whenever the 1017 issues subside. <br>
<br>
You may remove my access from these forums. It won't make much difference anyway as I will not be frequenting this place anymore.<br>
<br>
edit: One question and it is rhetorical. Exactly how has the guild changed from Ajlea to your &quot;leadership&quot;? Have you led any raids? PLed anyone?<br>
<br>
Before you answer, please don't claim WotDs involvement in wtfhugs as a credit to yourself.  I am quite sure they would survive without your &quot;leadership&quot;. In addition to that, anyone can post an app, so don't claim that it was because of you that people got in.<br>

Was it done completely professionaly and without emotion?  No.  But Linamas is not at fault here.<br>
<br>
I consider myself a non biased witness to everything that occured in the O Channel and in guild chat and this is the story through my eyes.<br>
<br>
What happened between Tang and Toter is between them.  I have no opinion of the matter.  An officer deguilded a member from the guild with a.) No proof behind his thinking, and b.) without going through the proper channels.  An officer is not permitted to deguild any member without first discussing it with the officers currently on line, of which I believe there were 5.  I understand Tang is an emotional man with a short temper, ask Savina, I can relate, but deguilding Toter in the manner in which he did broke the rules set up by the officers.  Tangisto has been a long time member and respected officer of the guild for a very long time.  Misunderstanding could occur.  However, emotions got to the better of everyone, yes, Aj and Linamas too, and it was blown out of the water before a peaceful situation could be arrived upon.  The deguilding(s) following Toter's reinvite were simply a move of spite and were completely childish.  Linamas had no choice as guild leader, bestowed to him by Ajlea after WILLINGLY stepping down, but to eliminate the abuse of power being displayed by Tangisto by deguilding him, all of his and Ajleas's officer alts.  Linamas did what he had to in order to protect the guild from the possibility of a disgruntled officer maliciously deguilding members at random or by design.  This was an act of a good Guild Leader.  He made the tough call and I stand by him.  This does not mean that I have any sort of problem with either Ajlea or Tangisto.  Quite frankly the situation is between the three of them and no one has any right to interfere.  However, the actions of my Guild Leader were attacked and I saw the need to defend them in the same manner that I would if Ajlea were still leader.<br>
<br>
I have a lot of love for Ajlea, however, she is by no means the Martyr here.  Ajlea stepped down due to, what was basically, a voicing of dissatisfatction given to her by her chosen officers and long time friends.  It was harsh at times, but, again only as I saw it, fair.  Being a guild leader is a stressful job, the same as any position of management.  Ajlea led to the best of her abilities, and when she felt she could no longer do so, she stepped down the way a good leader does.  Through my tenure as a member, both times mind you, I have knocked heads with Ajlea many times, and every time, we've survived.  This too is survivable, but it is not our job to see to it.  Our job is to see to it that the guild goes through this rough time as smoothly as possible and show the strength that Ajlea, Tangisto, Linamas, and many others have forged us to have.<br>
<br>
With the upmost respect,<br>
Varyn<br>
<br>
P.S. I am the guild's Raid leader and have now attempted two raids (one for every week I've been in the position).  Both have failed due to lack of participation, there is nothing Ajlea or Linamas can do about that.<br>
<br>
Both Ajlea and Linamas have always, and still been here for the guild.  I am witness that in past times Ajlea was the most supportive person in the guild.  Due to RL time contraints and a general unhappiness, the last few weeks of her tenure saw little on line time.  Howver, when she was on, she was with guild mates.  Linamas has not failed to step up and do the same.  He has aided people in getting their tactics flags via the PoS quest, and has been involved with many guild groups.  Without a doubt in my mind, this trend will continue.  I say this not because he's now the Guild Leader, but because this is the way he has always been as long as I've known him.<br>
<br>
wtf has no bearing of any type concerning this matter and I hope that there will be no issues coming from it.  Choose sides if you see fit, but I, for one, will continuue to support my guild, and will remain friends with those that have come and gone.<br>

<br>
The same officers and members that complained about not having raids were the same ones who skipped guild raids planned one week out for BBR raids.<br>
<br>
Then for the next few days she listened to people complain that the guild didn't raid.<br>
<br>
Due to this oxymoron (I would call it stupidity) why would she not throw her hands up in frustration? I don't think she gave up on a personal choice as much as she was pushed to the point of stepping down.<br>
<br>
It was cool to take and take from Ajlea until she got smart enough to not take it anymore. Then she got sand kicked in her face until she saw no reason to stay around.<br>
<br>
I led a guild myself, probably before most of you picked up your first copy of EQ.  I know what goes into it. She talked to me about what she was going through and I advised her to delete the guild, and this was a year ago, maybe more. She stuck with it for longer than I would have.<br>
<br>
As far as any lasting impact, Ajlea and Laedil are welcome to wander any path with me. This will have little bearing on me. The way it impacts you is up to you to decide. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub65.ezboard.com/bvoiceofthedragon.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varynskatterhawk>Varyn Skatterhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nagafen</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(2/15/04 4:23 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://avatar.milkysavatars.net/gohan4.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, for the love of...</span><hr size=1> I understand the frustration, and I don't fault Ajlea for her decision to step down.

<br>
First off, you aren't getting the full details to the story as you are blinded by the one side that you've heard and you refuse to look beyond that.<br>
<br>
WotD is NOT a raiding guild.  Never has been, never will be.  This is not because of inaptitude of the officers, but because it is the goal of this guild to NOT be a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
We are a FAMILY guild.  We attract players who play this game as a recreation after the long hours of RL endeavors.  Most of the players in this guild don't play more then maybe 20 hours a week, and that's pushing it.  Many are lucky if they can get on for an hour to converse with friends around work and kids.<br>
<br>
WotD is a place were Family and Friends can come together and have fun as a group, NOT as a raid.  They ask us to offer raids, and we do, we take request and we plan them.  But the people in this guild have Real Lives and are usually unable to attend.  We get frustrated.  Ajlea got frustrated (many times).  But how can we be frustrated over trying to make the guild do something that we explicitly identify ourselves as not doing.<br>
<br>
It has been the cycle with WotD that we will go through spurts of mass raiding and then mass nothing.  These cycles are related to the coming and going of high level players who became high level under our banner and were epiced by our raids.  They take and Take, and then leave.  Don't think that I'm pointing this at Gwapa in particular.  Many have done this.  You said so yourself that this guild has been used as farming grounds for many raiding guilds.  There is little if anything that we can do to change this.  If people want to leave, then they leave.  If they are not satisfied with the Family atmosphere and want something more out of the game Raid wise, then they will leave.  We don't beg them to stay.  We don't guilt them for what they have gotten out of the guild.  We let them go.<br>
<br>
You know why?<br>
<br>
Because above all else, Everquest is a Game.  The characters we play are composed of Binary and Pixels.  We Play this Game to have FUN.  We play with friends in this game because we have fun with them.<br>
<br>
In the context of guilds: They are led by ONE Leader and his/her Officers.  As in any good organization, the Leader must communicate with the Officers and the Officers must communicate back to the Leader.  In this way, the Leadership of a guild is organized and enabled to take actions that are in the best interest of the guild.<br>
<br>
When a Real Life friend is invited to this guild by the Guild Leader with support of at least one other officer (let us not forget that this person was in fact one of the founders of this guild who has been on vacation from the game for nearly a year due to Real Life situations such as getting married), then that person is welcomed back into the family.  Just because one Officer and an exe Guild Leader who has resigned her officership entirely desiring to be nothing more then a member (and we have the log of that dialogue from the guild meeting) decide that they just don't like the answer this person gives when asked who was playing the character, is not reason enough to remove them.  Not only did they remove this person once, but after the officers discussed the situation and this person we allowed back into the guild, he was removed again by the officer (Laedil) AFTER the Guild Leader (Linamas) had camped, making a direct breach of protocol on two instances in the same night; actions worthy of guild removal.<br>
<br>
But the issue of how this debate started is not the focus of your argument Rhyls.  You are upset because of what you believe (based on what Ajlea told you) is the reason why she gave up her leadership.  You give reference to a time a year ago when a situation of similar proportions arose in the guild.  I remember that time too.  But I will not go into the details of it as it is in the past and not pertinent to the situation that is at hand at this time.  Pertaining to this situation now, you were not privy to the actual conversations between Ajlea and the Guild Officers leading up to the transfer of power.  You were not privy to the actions taken by our guild leader that led to the frustration of the Officers in the first place.  You are not privy to the FACTS of the matter, only the opinions of one person who NOW takes the position as the victim when it was by her own will to give up leadership after the arguments had been settled.<br>
<br>
In closing: I would like to point out the extremely bad form in making any reference to WTFHugs.  They have nothing to do with this situation and the attempt that you have taken to wrap them up in it is a great disrespect to the integrity of their organization.  You are a member, Ajlea is a member, Linamas is a member, Varyn is a member, I am a member, and so are 60+ other people who have absolutely NOTHING to do with this.  Leave them out of it.<br>

<br>
****First off, you aren't getting the full details to the story as you are blinded by the one side that you've heard and you refuse to look beyond that.<br>
<br>
I have not even talked to Ajlea about it, just heard about it through other sources.<br>
<br>
<br>
****WotD is NOT a raiding guild. Never has been, never will be. This is not because of inaptitude of the officers, but because it is the goal of this guild to NOT be a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
Could have fooled me, all I heard was people crying about raids and then when they happened nobody went. Then cried about how nobody raided.<br>
<br>
<br>
****We are a FAMILY guild. We attract players who play this game as a recreation after the long hours of RL endeavors. Most of the players in this guild don't play more then maybe 20 hours a week, and that's pushing it. Many are lucky if they can get on for an hour to converse with friends around work and kids.<br>

Blah blah<br>

But the people in this guild have Real Lives and are usually unable to attend. We get frustrated. Ajlea got frustrated (many times). But how can we be frustrated over trying to make the guild do something that we explicitly identify ourselves as not doing.<br>
<br>
Oh, the we don't raid cause we have real lives justification, got it.<br>
<br>
<br>
****It has been the cycle with WotD that we will go through spurts of mass raiding and then mass nothing. These cycles are related to the coming and going of high level players who became high level under our banner and were epiced by our raids. They take and Take, and then leave. Don't think that I'm pointing this at Gwapa in particular. <br>
<br>
Gwapa did most of her epic herself, asking for help just with the King of Chardok. My exp group could single group Ragefire, so exactly how significant was your contribution to her vs the amount of support she gave everyone else in return? I myself gained nothing being in WotD, (but neither did I ask for anything but companionship) but helped out quite a bit on epic raids. I don't think I would make a comparison as to whom benefitted from whom.<br>
<br>
****Because above all else, Everquest is a Game. The characters we play are composed of Binary and Pixels. We Play this Game to have FUN. We play with friends in this game because we have fun with them.<br>
<br>
Yet its ok to grief Ajlea until she is miserable enough to give up the guild right?<br>
<br>
****When a Real Life friend is invited to this guild by the Guild Leader with support of at least one other officer (let us not forget that this person was in fact one of the founders of this guild who has been on vacation from the game for nearly a year due to Real Life situations such as getting married), then that person is welcomed back into the family.

Waste of time, all this stuff is just gravy for the crap you guys already pulled.<br>
<br>
****But the issue of how this debate started is not the focus of your argument Rhyls. You are upset because of what you believe (based on what Ajlea told you) is the reason why she gave up her leadership. <br>
<br>
I am hardly upset, just pointing out how @#%$ up you guys are.<br>
<br>
****You are not privy to the FACTS of the matter, only the opinions of one person who NOW takes the position as the victim when it was by her own will to give up leadership after the arguments had been settled.<br>
<br>
For someone who preaches facts, you sure present alot of opinions.<br>
<br>
****In closing: I would like to point out the extremely bad form in making any reference to WTFHugs. <br>
<br>
I don't give a @#%$ what you think. <br>
<br>
If you read what I stated it was in reference to you not trying to say that &quot;We got everyone elemental flagged now that Ajlea is gone&quot; cause frankly, you didn't have @#%$ to do with it other than show up.<br>
