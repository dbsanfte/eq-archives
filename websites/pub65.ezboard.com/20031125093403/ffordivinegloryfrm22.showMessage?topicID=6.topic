This guy is located on the right side of the wall in Planes of Valor.<br>
<br>
you say, 'Hail, Grenic Drere'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:21 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Mortals, this far into the planes? Something that I never thought that I would see. Regardless that does not help my situation any does it?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:30 2002] You say, 'what situation?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:30 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Not that it is your business, but this is where I call home. I have lost track of the years that I have spent here. This valley is my home, for I was exiled from [Mithaniel's Temple]. It is not a story that I am proud of and do not wish to share with you. So be one with you.'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:50 2002] You say, 'where is Mithaniel's Temple?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:50 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Only a mortal would be as thick headed to know not when to take their leave. He and his legions call his temple The Halls of Honor. Paladins that have served him well on Norrath have the opportunity to ascend into his ranks. They are in training to make sure that they are always prepared to defend what they believe is the right and honorable thing to do. Mithaniel is an extremely proud being, and will accept any challenge that you may have to offer him. If you are willing to challenge him, I may have some [information] you will find useful.'<br>
'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:54 2002] You say, 'what information?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:55 2002] Grenic Drere says 'There are other methods to enter the Halls of Honor than those that are readily apparent, and as a former soldier of Marr I can offer you access into the Halls; however as with all such arrangements there must be something [paid] for something earned.'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:09:01 2002] You say, 'paid?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:09:01 2002] Grenic Drere says 'I was not the only member of my squad that was sent into exile, my brothers in arms, were the impetus for our exile. I was but a mere pawn. They now reside in the Plane of Justice as bodiless shades. Their punishment was too lax for their actions; I want their eternal souls to be mine. Find a smith who will teach you to create a box of souls, weaken the shades, then capture their souls and return all three to me.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bork Darkanvil is Located in Plane of Knowledge, he resides at -388, 493 in a building in the middle area but ground level.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:05 2002] You say, 'Hail, Borik Darkanvil'<br>
<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:05 2002] Borik Darkanvil says 'Greetings, Borik Darkanvil, at your service. I was once a planar traveler like you. Those days are behind me, now I am content to earn my keep as a blacksmith, and to experiment with some of the [special recipes] that I have picked up in these outer planes.'<br>
<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:14 2002] You say, 'do you know of the box of souls?'<br>
<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:14 2002] Borik Darkanvil says 'Borik Darkanvil's eyes grow narrow. 'So looking to capture some souls are you? It's none of my business I suppose so don't answer. I'm pretty sure that I don't want to know. I paid heavily for the formula for the Box of Souls, but its not a price I would pass on to anyone else. There isn't much to it, but it does take the hands of a skilled smith and the magic of Tanaan's forges to event attempt it. First you will need a block of [Perilium].'<br>
<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:25 2002] You say, 'what is a block of Perilium?'<br>
<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:25 2002] Borik Darkanvil says 'Perilium was once used to make clockwork machines, there are now stronger metals so it has become harder and harder to find Perilium, much less a block that is large enough to be of any use. Then you will need to find the brain of a crystal spider, this is where the actual soul will be held. Of course the box will need a supernatural power source, the souls are held into place by the horror of their own dreams, the heart of an agony mephit will give the device that power. Forge these with a smithing hammer and a vial of sacred water and you will have your box. Of course if you have not the skill, I can [forge them for you].'<br>
<br>
[[Sat Oct 26 18:10:56 2002] You say, 'forge them for me?'<br>
<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:10:56 2002] Borik Darkanvil says 'If you return all three items to me I will do the work for you for, a mere three thousand platinum. I will not guarantee my success, but I can guarantee if you do not have the skill, you will fail.'<br>

<br>
Now Head to Valor for the brain. It drops off a rare spawn <br>
'a crystalline crawler' named 'a luminni crawler'<br>
<br>
Next head for Innovation for the perillium. This is a random drop off any mob in the zone 1/100.<br>
<br>
Last head to Nightmare for the heart. This is a drop off and agony mephit deep inthe back of the hobgoblin caves. <br>
<br>
Take these 3 items and 3000pp to Borik Darkanvil. <br>
<br>
You say, 'forge them for me?'<br>
<br>
Borik Darkanvil says 'If you return all three items to me I will do the work for you for, a mere three thousand platinum. I will not guarantee my success, but I can guarantee if you do not have the skill, you will fail.'<br>
<br>
With some luck he'll craft the box for ya. Once you get the box it's off to PoJustice to gather the 3 souls.<br>
<br>
Around the corner from the door leading down to the trials is another door. Inside spawn 3 tormented wraiths on a 20min spawn cycle. Kill each one of these, they have a 1/10 chance of spawning 1 of 3 mobs. These mobs are named &quot;an exiled soldier of marr&quot;, &quot;an exiled officer of marr&quot;, and an exiled trooper of marr&quot;.<br>
<br>
You need to hand the box of souls each one of these and get a soul stone from each one. <br>
<br>
Take your 3 soul stones back to Grenic Drere.<br>
<br>
Grenic Drere says 'Hmm, this is minor vindication, but vindication nonetheless. I will never again fight with my old compatriots, but now I know the punishment of those responsible for my exile is fitting for their crime. We did have an agreement, and while stripped of my rank I still have my honor. This ring is what all Soldiers of Marr wear to enter the Halls of Honor, it serves no use for me any longer, it is yours now.'<br>
<br>
You recieve a character flag.<br>
<br>
You will recieve a ring of marr, and are now flagged for Halls of Honor. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ruralcoalition.com/sigs/Buddar/jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
