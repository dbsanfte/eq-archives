        Just outside the Surefall Glade entrance you will find an NPC named
        Chanda Miller.<br>
        <br>
        If you approach her and tell her that &quot;Baobob sent me&quot; she
        will open up and talk to you. Follow through the bracketted dialogue and
        you will find that she will make you a Bear Hide Belt for a low quality
        bear skin and 5gp. For a medium quality bear skin and 15gp, she will
        make you the Bear Hide Boots, and for 21gp and a high quality bear skin
        she will make you a Bear Hide Cloak.<br>
        <br>
        You can obtain these skins in various zones where bears abound. Such
        places as Qeynos Hills, all of the Karanas and the Commonlands are
        heavily populated with bears.<br>
        <br>
        You must use &quot;skins&quot; for this to work. this has a tendency to
        confuse people who may be looking for &quot;pelts&quot;.<br>

        To start the quest you need to hail the undead knight which is in Najina.
        He's in the same room as Drezna. I didn't do this step, I hailed him
        last just to make sure I had everything. You need the right &amp; left
        decaying boot which are dropped by the crusaders in The Lost Temple of
        Cazic-Thule in Ferrot. Next you can either buy Farie dust or kill faries
        in Greater Faydark for 2 things of farie dust. Take all 4 items to the
        undead knight in Najina &amp; give it all to him. Make sure the farie
        dust is not stacked. You will now have darkforge boots.</p>

        &quot;The quest is as follows :<br>
        The Paladin Lord, Lord Jyleel, in the basement of the Paladin's guild
        wants you to [prove yourself a faithful paladin of the court]. He asks
        you to present him 3 things to prove this, and you shall wield &quot;The
        falchion&quot;, a<br>
        paladin only weapon. Bring him the heart of Dvinn, find the supreme
        caster of the orcs, and also find the supply crate at the supply drop
        point from the orcs to the Tier'dal. Killing D'Vinn in Crushbone gets
        you his heart and<br>
        killing the orc prophet in Crushbone gets you a blue orc head. The crate
        is dropped by Brarm in the Ocean of Tears. He is about level 22 and
        spawns once per game day at 5am with 2 dark elf dragoons (approximately
        level 18 to 22)<br>

        Zamel has been looking for a friends missing child. Apparently the child
        has<br>
        wandered into the local sewers and asks for information on her
        wareabouts.<br>
        He also says he will give you a reward if you locate any information of
        the<br>
        child.<br>
        <br>
        Conversation:<br>
        <br>
        1. Zamel describes the (aqeuducts).<br>
        <br>
        You say &quot;What aquedcuts&quot;<br>
        <br>
        2. Zamel describes scary (Beasts)<br>
        <br>
        You say &quot;What beasts&quot;<br>
        <br>
        3. Zamel describes the missing (child)<br>
        <br>
        You say &quot;who's child&quot;<br>
        <br>
        4. Zamel will then ask you to being back any proff of the childs death.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        In the sewers of Qeynos there is a special NPC named Cubert. Cubert<br>
        apparently killed the child. If you can find and kill Cubert, you might<br>
        recieve a LORE item in the form of a &quot;Tattered Dress&quot;. This is
        the dress of<br>
        the missing child.<br>
        <br>
        Take the dress back to Zamel, and repeat the mentioned conversation. If
        you<br>
        are lucky Zamel will reward you with the Golden Earring Stud. His common<br>
        drop is a piece of Hemetite, worth a few gold coins.<br>
        <br>
        He drops the Earring approximatly 25% of the time.<br>
        <br>
        The trick to the quest is to kill the placeholders of cubert. Cubert
        only<br>
        spawn in a select location and wanders a VERY small area of about 50
        in-game<br>
        feet.<br>
        <br>
        His placeholders are Geletanous Cubes, Sewer rats and another named rat
        that<br>
        I can't think of right now.</p>

        you 2 quests.<br>

        Tears and visit the rocks that have Sirens on them. There will be a
        named Troll called Nerbilik. Give him the item that the Neriak NPC gave
        you and then kill him. He drops the recipe.<br>

        In the Ocean of Tears you must kill a thief named Witlin. He spawns on<br>
        the isle with Captain Surestout, Gornit, Dixl Drool, and all the seafury<br>
        cyclops'. His placeholder is a buccaneer, and spawn rate seems to vary<br>
        between 1 and 2 hours. Witlin has the Quiver of Kithicor, which you<br>
        must fill with 6 unique arrows that the brownie outcasts stole.<br>
        <br>
        They<br>
        are located in Lesser Faydark, at the Pixie Tower. Killing the pixies<br>
        seems to cause the brownie outcasts to spawn, but don't kill the pixie<br>
        jongleurs! You will very likely get duplicate arrows, so it's good to<br>
        do it with another ranger friend. Put all 6 arrows in the Quiver, and<br>
        combine them.<br>
        <br>
        You will also need a Star of Odus can be purchased in Erudin.<br>

        around level 24 or 25.<br>
        <br>

        -1 for one stat, +1 for another.<br>

        where the razorfish are. It looks like a bag.<br>
        <br>
        4) Head to Kerra Isle and find Princess Mitty. Kill her to get the
        copper and gold rings. She also drops the silver. The gold ring is her
        rare drop, and she doesn't always drop any of the 3 rings. You should be
        at least level 23 before attempting this. Doing this part before level
        23 will result in all of the Priestesses around Mitty jumping when you
        attack her.<br>
        <br>
        5) Kill Gynok Moltar in Befallen. He spawns right at the entrance, but
        has many placeholders (a gnoll, a large rat, a plague rat, an ice boned
        skeleton, a skeleton). Some of which will say something about distrubing
        their sleep. You may have to kill the entire 3rd floor, as that is where
        the place holders wander down to. Sometimes the rats will get hung up at
        the door to the skeleton room just after the first locked door.<br>
        <br>
        6) Once you have all 4 rings, put them in the container and hit combine.<br>

        <p>1) Talk to Brin Stolunger in the Qeynos Warriors Guild. It is located
        in S. Qeynos. He will give you the quest and a 10 slot container.<br>
        <br>
        2) Head to the N. Qeynos newbie zone and collect 5 batwings and 5 snake
        scales. Combine these in the 10 slot container. Take the container back
        to Brin and he will give you a note to take to Axe Broadsmith.<br>
        <br>
        3) Head to Qeynos hills and give the note to Axe. You will find him near
        the lake. He will ask you to kill a strange skeleton across the pond.
        Kill it and bring its skull back to Axe. He will give you a letter to
        take back to Brin.<br>
        <br>
        4) Head back to S. Qeynos and give the note to Brin. He will give you
        yet another note to deliver to the area below the arena. It is for
        Graham Rothkar.<br>
        <br>
        5) Give the note to Graham and he will give you a key, telling you it is
        your final test. The key opens one of the lion pens. Enter, kill the
        lion, and bring its pelt and meat back to Graham. He will give you the
        Strongbear Bracers.<br>

        <p>**Submitted by Chris B.**<br>
        <br>
        &quot;The quest for the Soulfire is VERY long, and involved. To begin
        the quest you must speak to Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of Truth (In
        North Freeport). She'll give you a note which you need to deliver to
        Guard Alayle (Or something close), a spy in the freeport militia
        building. Go in and<br>
        deliver the note, only to receive an illegible peice of paper in return
        (And get to see the guard get killed). Take the note back to Kalatrina,
        and she'll tell you to talk to Rashinda Elore in the Freeport Office of
        the People (NOTE : Once you give the note to Kalatrina, you'll have to
        wait six<br>
        hours to get another one.) Ask Rashinda &quot;Have you heard of Zimel's
        Blades?', then ask her about Ariska Zimel ('Who was Ariska Zimel?'), and
        finally about Groflah Steadirt ('Who is Groflah Steadirt?'). Head back
        to Kalatrina and<br>
        tell her that Zimel's Blades was condemned. After this, it's time to
        visit Groflah Steadirt. Go to Groflah's forge in North Freeport, and
        give him the note. He will give it back, and tell you to meet him in the
        seafarers roost<br>
        at night. Don't bet on seeing him. I have stayed in that building for
        nearly two straight days, without seeing him once. Instead, wait for a
        beggar named 'Tykar Renlon' (Or something close, he's the only beggar
        who appears) to<br>
        spawn and immediately set about giving him five Drom's Champagnes. He
        disappears quickly, so you must hurry. Once you've given him all five,
        he'll give you a blanket. Go make yourself some bog juice and edible goo
        (Two easy<br>
        baking and brewing recipes), then give one goo to the beggar in jail.
        Once he asks for 'Bog'n goo! Blanket too!', give him 1 bog juice, 1
        edible goo, and the blanket, to get a key (H.K. 102). Take the key to
        the banker in high<br>
        keep to get a note. Give this note to Brother Hayle (The Cleric
        imprisoned in Splitpaw - Be careful you don't lock yourself in his
        cell!), and he'll give it back to you, as well as the intructions of
        what else to get to gain<br>
        the Soulfire. He will tell you to get the Glowing Hilt, the Brilliant
        Sword of Faith, and your Testimony. The Glowing Hilt is found on Xicotl,
        the troll shadowknight in Mistmoore Castle. To get the Brilliant sword
        of faith, kill<br>
        Sir Lucan D'lere and his skeletal remains, gain his testimony, then give
        that testimony to Valeron. To get your Testimony, first speak to Merko
        in the hall of truth. He'll give you a note to give to Altunic Jartin in
        EC.<br>
        Wait in Altunic's house for him to appear (It's near the last inn before
        WC), and give him the note. Walk outside, and fight Squire Narl. He
        packs a good punch, and his Harm Touch can be painful on a lower-level
        character,<br>
        but he's not too hard. After killing him and getting his head, go buy a
        cloth shirt from one of the merchants in the commons (I beleive the inn
        between orc camps sells the shirt). Give the head to Altunic, then give
        him<br>
        the shirt, to get a Token of Generosity. Buy (Or fight for one) a Spider
        Venom Sack, and return to Merko. Tell him you've earned the Token of
        Generosity, and he'll ask you for the sack. Give it to him, and get the
        Token of Bravery. Then hand in both tokens to get your final task : Run
        into<br>
        the sewers and kill the Militia spy there, and return her token to Merko
        to get your Testimony. Once you have all these items, hand the returned
        note from bother hayle, the hilt, the sword, and the testimony to
        Brother Hayle<br>
        (NOTE : You must have AT LEAST Kindly faction with him, or you'll have
        to start all over again!) to receive the Soulfire.<br>

        <p>You pretty much need to be an enchanter to do this quest, as almost
        all of the components for the quest are no drop and you are required to
        go to all corners of Norrath.<br>
        <br>
        1) Talk to Clurg, the Ogre Bartender in Ogguk to obtain the quest.<br>
        <br>
        2) Head to Freeport and speak with Gregor, who has the Bartender's
        Compendium that Clurg wants back. Gregor will tell you about an exotic
        drink that he wants to make. You must get the ingredients before he will
        give you the compendium.<br>
        <br>
        3) Purchase a Kiola nut from the Island of Erollisi<br>
        <br>
        4) Get an Erud's Tonic. It is a side quest, which you can </font><a HREF="/quests/eruds_tonic.shtml"><font SIZE="2">read
        about here</font></a><font SIZE="2">.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        6) Head to North Qeynos. Kill the fish that is in the pond in the Temple
        of Life compound. A warning. You take major faction hits by killing the
        fish. The guards will attack you when you attack the fish. Loot the fish
        for it's corpse. I suggest gating immediately.<br>
        <br>
        7) Take the Kiola Nut, Erud's Tonic, Honey Jum and the fish corpse to
        Gregor to receive the Bartender's Compendium.<br>
        <br>
        8) Take the Compendium to Clurg in Ogguk to receive the Stein of Moggok.
        You need at least and indifferent faction with Clurg for this to work.</p>

        will<br>
        tell you to find Watchman Dexlin in the Karanas for a special mission.<br>
        Watchman Dexlin is a rare spawn on the Bridge to South Karana. When you<br>
        hail Dexlin he will tell you that he is looking for a brave warrior to
        deal<br>
        with some pesky skeletons. If you tell him &quot;I am a brave
        warrior&quot; he gives<br>
        you a box and tells you to find &quot;tiny skeletons&quot; and return it
        to him when<br>
        you have filled it with their bones. After you get the box a number of<br>
        tiny skeletons will spawn somewhere between the bridge and the gypsie
        camp.<br>
        They are only upper teens but at level 24 I had problems soloing 3 at
        once.<br>
        Kill four of them, loot their bones and combine them in the box. Return
        the<br>
        box to Dexlin and he gives it back and tells you to give it to Lord
        Jenork<br>
        in Ak'kanon to get your reward which is Watchman Boots and a few plat.</p>
