And you know this to be true.<br>
<br>
I'm not gonna be a purist and for one second suggest that the game we play now is worse overall then the game we started playing.  No many things have been altered, are now nicer then they used to be.<br>
<br>
However...<br>
<br>
Our game has been gimped. It's now too easy. Yes, you can still die to massive unthinking trains. Yes, guard mobs in some zones are more powerful the entire *ZONES* in Kunark/Antonica and those the high end zones, too.<br>
<br>
This has had a detrious effect on the high end game most of all.  This is where a higher end guild takes these players and has to essentially break them of their bad habits to try and mold a player that will occasionally not screw up, versus one that can be depended on in all sorts of conditions.<br>
<br>
Some of us, like myself, recognize our limitations and play just one character. For every Listero, Tanilium or Cucullin, there are more and more people that achieve a lvl 60 character and then start over as another class in hopes of &quot;phat lewtz&quot; or &quot;groups&quot;.  There's very few fundamentelly solid ones.  There are very few Azzn's and Jarsek's, people capable of playing *any* class solidly, if not spectacularly in normal game play.<br>
<br>
Instead, the high end game finds itself littered with people applying that can't honestly tell you how many hp Vox or Nagafen had. Mostly because they had better items and couldn't be bothered to try and upgrade to any of the dragon items so the plvld past these encounters.<br>
<br>
Instead, they got up to lvl 53 then started putted points into AA for Run3 because everyone else did, and started the exp grind back up to 60.<br>
<br>
Totally missing out on the joys, rigors, and pains of many of the experiences that season a character. Exp grouping or soloing to 60, but never in a dangerous situation where they have to try and figure exactly how much mana they have, if that last nuke or heal is gonna save a raid.  Instead, they learn to chain cast heals/nukes, and are constantly surprised to find out that their instantly killed in large encounters because the basic fundamentals of how to integrate into a large body of people is missing.<br>
<br>
The ability to follow orders, to sacrifice some precious exp to save a logging out cleric...the ability to recognize that their class is more then just an offensive one or a defensive one. All missing.<br>
<br>
All missing because lvls &gt; all.<br>
<br>
There is no inherent right that lvls &gt; all and therefore phat lewtz.  The only advantage lvl 60 gives you is the ability to farm mobs in some zones better with less aggro. Yeah, I know, you'll resist AE's better, too...but the fact is....<br>
<br>
The fundamentals of the characters are still not solid.<br>
<br>
Should the game be more accessible to newer players? Yes. More accessible is good.  The newbie quests are *great* for this.<br>
<br>
But should it be *easier*.<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
And unfortunately, it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ukambok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kambok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lenindara the Keeper </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/26/02 6:01:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2764.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Gimpification of Norrath</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
Yup, I'm a big ass gimp, I have no idea how many hp's they have. 15k hp's???<br>
<br>
Some people dont like to trouble themselves with such trival bullshit. I have to remember enough shit day in day out with computers and programming. Knowing everything in a _video game_ does not perk my interest. I spend my time and Brain capacity on other important things, not memorizing the HP's of a monster in Everquest.<br>
<br>
When I get home from work. I enjoy relaxing, killing shit on EQ. Not trying to calculate how many nukes will it take to kill mob X if he resists my spells 10% of the time with each spell being partial resisted around ~30%. No thanks. I play to have fun and kill shit.<br>
<br>
You are correct in the game getting easier. I think thats a good thing. Its really not that much easier, you can still get your ass handed to you very easy in EQ. Newbie levels, try playing a newbie char to lvl-20 WITHOUT twinking. Its still a challenge, just not as hard as it was in the old days. No more spending 10 hours searching for your lvl-5 corpse, which would make people delete the char and start a new one.<br>
<br>
One thing that I dont understand though, is everyone wants to shoot for lvl-60. I still dont have a lvl-60 char in the 3 years that I have been playing. Got bunches of lvl-50+ chars, but not one lvl-60. It doesnt bother me at all, I just play a class I'm going to have fun with.<br>
<br>
Another thing that I dont understand is the why do people only hunt outdoor zones? Don't those zones get SOOOO boring, pulling single pull after single pull?<br>
<br>
I hate outdoor zones, I dread being a puller in an outdoor zone. All that running back and forth looking for a monster.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
What you might be missing is.... levels ARE &gt; *<br>
<br>
Levels is why they aren't allowed to go on HoT raids.<br>
Levels is why they cant go to the new re-vamped CT.<br>
<br>
Levels is what the players who have been playing for so long have and held over the heads of so many in Norrath for as long as they could.  Now the &quot;uber&quot; players have primal, and  and that's the reason they cant handle this encounter or that uber mob.  Well eventually they will get that gear.  What then?<br>
<br>
What it comes down to is skill.  I guess I'm a bit of a purist too in that I take a TREMENDOUS amount of pride in my abilities as a chanter.  The greatest accomplishment to DATE for me is when Istrahd told me I was one of the better chanters on the server.  I don't need to be the best, but it felt good to be given respect by someone I held in such high esteem.... but I digress.<br>
<br>
Tani, you ARE, and will always be, a purist.  Its the reason you are the quality player you continue to be.  I think that VI is just catering to the lowest common denominator.  But they cant take away the pride you have in playing your monk greater then 99% of the server. <p><center>

<br>
I don't think the lack of skill or game knowledge is the product of EQ being gimpified.  It think it is the nature of the players you are talking about and their drive for the high end game.  They <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> can't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> apply to guilds like Sigil till they are level 60.  Why should they bother with all the crap in between like Vox and Kunark content.  The only quantifiable barrier that matters is level 60 so they push for it as fast and hard as possible.<br>
<br>
This result in leveling through their 50s in Velks while avoiding low end raids because they only slow them down.  Some people naturally catch on to things by themselves, other need instructions on how to wipe their own ass.  The game has little to do with it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/utahs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tahs</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.liquid2k.com/tahs/weird%20head.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Burrower Parasite </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/26/02 6:48:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2764.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/tahs/weird%20head.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Gimpification of Norrath</span><hr size=1> /shrug<br>
<br>
I consider myself a newbie at this point in the game for the first time in 2 1/2 years. Anyone who is relearning how to play the game no matter what the situation needs to understand this.  Its a matter of experience.  Knowledge used to be the key to playing EQ, if you *knew* what you were doing then you succeded.  However I look and read what some of you are pulling off, and wonder how the fuck it happens ; ). i remember when developing a MT strat was like woah this works so thats about as far as my basic experience is going.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have however played with some people who are *amazing players* as they lvl up post kunark, post velious even. no they are not amazing players in that they could handle the end game, but they are the ones who stick around untill the GROUP LEADER calls a run, they are the ones who worked hard to know their class, and doesnt panic when somthing new steps up, and they will become great in the end game if they keep it up.<br>
<br>
Most of us learn very fast, if you show how to do somthing then i will do it.  If you want me to figure somthing out, then i will screw up alot, but i will do it.  I follow directions very well, thats what im most proud of i guess, through relvling the game slowly ive learned what my limitations with my new class are, and what i can do to improve them. <p><HR>

If someone screws up your raid, either give them the benefit of your knowledge so that they can improve their performance, or don't invite them back.  If they are not invited back, they will eventually seek out others in their class to find out what they can do to improve, or they will simply not participate in the high-end game.<br>
<br>
You ask whether the game should be easier and answer &quot;no&quot;.  From whose perspective?  From the hard-core gamer's perspective?  From the casual gamer's perspective?  From Verant's perspective?<br>
<br>
Easier might sell more games, so Verant is happy.  Easier might mean the casual gamer will see 80% of the game content, so they are happy.  Easier means more gamers reach the high-end content faster (possibly unprepared), so you and probably other hard-core gamers probably aren't happy if they are unprepared.  But if they are unprepared and unskilled, why group or raid with them?  Stick to your message and insist they learn their class first.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><CENTER>

It is the person in front of the monitor who determines how good they will be in x encounter, not the game.  You can't change the people in front of the monitor just through the game.  No matter what the game is like, they are just going to try to get up to the highest level and get all kinds of neat loot.<br>
<br>
I'd say about 80% of the EQ population is made up of people like this.  They just want to get up there and get good loot and be &quot;uber&quot;.  The other 20% really enjoy doing what they do and doing it well.  <br>
<br>
It is not the game, it's the person playing it who decides how much they learn about the game and how they put that knowledge to good use. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120465>Trap Sprung</a> | <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys T'Vyl</a></center><br><center>55 Human <a href=http://www.monkly-business.com>Master</a> of the Celestial Fists</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/unekrotic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nekrotic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nagafen</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/26/02 7:14:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2764.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Gimpification of Norrath</span><hr size=1> I don't think there has been a &quot;gimpification&quot; if you will.  Part of the problem is the assumption that this game takes a lot of skill.  It doesn't.  It does take some, and being stupid or not being able to follow commands does hurt, but honestly, if you are even halfway decent then the game can be successful for you.<br>
<br>
That part I agree with you Tani, because at that point, the only thing that matters is levels.  Raid guilds know this because they will take a level 60 character who can follow orders over a level 40 character who may be a genius at EQ and knows all the nuances of the game.<br>
<br>
For something to truly require skill, it would have to be such that your results cannot be duplicated by others, or only in rare circumstances.  For example, Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods....it doesn't matter how many hours you practice hoops or spend on the driving range....you are probably never going to match their skill level.  In gaming terms, I think back to that one guy in Quake (the one that one the Ferrari), who only very rarely got beat.<br>
<br>
EQ is not that kind of game.  The only &quot;skill&quot; required is knowledge and execution.  Knowledge can be a stumbling block, but I think of it more as a time sink.  It's not like you're trying to build an atomic bomb or discover the cure to cancer.  Execution mainly means good leadership and having people that know how to follow directions.<br>
<br>
The proof that EQ isn't a skill game is the fact that the best results can be duplicated by so many.  There are at least 3 or 4 &quot;Michael Jordan&quot;s in EQ...FoH, Afterlife, Triton etc.....and put in enough time and effort, a few other guilds can rise to their status.<br>
<br>
You can spend every waking moment hitting a golf ball for years on end, and you will never beat Tiger Woods on a consistent basis.<br>
<br>
So once you see EQ for what it is, then you will be less apt to be disappointed.  You think EQ is too easy?  I think it wasn't ever that hard to begin with.<br>

There's a whole new breed of &quot;Captain Cobalt&quot; twinks shooting up to 60. You can tell who they are in a hurry. It's the level 60 with ALL droppable armor, wielding a Swiftblade of Zek.<br>
<br>
On the flipside, this is a natural result of Everquest shifting toward the &quot;everyone is 60&quot; universe. <br>
<br>
It's sad, because some of the greatest fun I have ever had in EQ was doing stupid stuff like tanking naggy and dying to Lady Vox.<br>

No offense to the clerics out there but not every group needs one. A necro, shaman, or a druid can do just as well for groups on a raid where that group doesn't have the MA or SA. So in a sense people need to learn more about the game and what every class can and cannot do. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46430>Wakkagud Ondahed</a><br><a href=http://www.mischief-n-mayhem.com>Mischief-n-Mayhem</a><br><a href="http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen/jedi" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen/jedi/dooku.jpg" width="285" height="123" border="0"><br>:: how jedi are you? ::</a>

These days you're seeing less and less people willing to assume that just because some guy is level 60 they are automatically uber.  Instead people must now work as a level 60 in order to stand out more and spend most of their level 60 days figuring things out, as opposed to figuring things out while you level up which can, from certain points of view, be more of a pain than is necessary when all you really want to focus on is leveling up and having fun.  In essence, it means that people can have more access to this &quot;being uber level 60&quot;, but some will not figure out the true fun of being a skilled player of your own class for quite some time after they reach level 60.  So really I think this gives us more of a focus on skill, we've had level 60's since Kunark and they haven't raised the level cap... so it seems to me like Verant is trying to put more emphasis on having skills while at the same time making things more approachable for casual and newer players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ulanayalanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lanaya Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm in the Planes!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/26/02 8:00:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2764.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Gimpification of Norrath</span><hr size=1> Not trying to be insulting, but I think there's a great deal of elitism and longing for a past that never was in your post.<br>
<br>
You have the same kind of glowing, rose-colored-glasses view of the old EQ world that an old grandfather has of the world he knew of the past.  The one where girls were girls and men were men, they walked uphill and back from school in the snow because it built character, and everyone knew their place and liked it.<br>
<br>
In reality, not everything was good about the old days of real life or the old days of EQ.<br>
<br>
EVERYTHING was camped, especially Sol B and Lguk.  In my first incarnation in EQ, I can remember the hordes of people in lguk, crowds sitting at the zone LFG for hours and not a mob up in the place.  It was kind of fun, because it would get to be like a party at the zone, but really, you wanted to be killing something, but everything was camped.<br>
<br>
Dragons died instantly once they spawned.<br>
<br>
Planes were perma-cleared.<br>
<br>
There were jerks and unskilled players aplenty back then too, same as there is now.<br>
<br>
I agree with Nekrotic -- there really isn't much skill to playing EQ.  The mob AI is not genius, and its not dynamic for the most part, which  means once someone has &quot;done&quot; the mob, there's no longer any challenge, you just repeat the process that worked the first time for the most part.  The only thing that EQ really requires, that some people have in abundance but other seem to completely lack, is not smarts or skills, but an ability to listen and work well with other people.  Its kind of like most people's jobs in the world - you don't have to be a genius, you just have to be aware of what's going on around you, be able to work well with others, and have the ability to concentrate on the task at hand.<br>
<br>
Other than that, there's really not much to succeeding in EQ.  You don't have to be Stephen Hawking to play this game, to get to see high-end content, or just plain have fun.<br>
<br>
Another thing that tends to rub me the wrong way about your post is your inference that the people you refer to as now hititng level 60, and doing it quickly, are noobs who have no skills and know nothing about the game like you and the 'old schoolers' you mentioned do.  Really, you have no idea who most of these people are, what they've done before these characters, or what they're capable of on a day-to-day basis.  You're taking your relatively few personal examples and applying them to a very much larger group of people.<br>
<br>
If you ever grouped with me, you'd probably think I was pretty gimp.  My gear sucks for the most part.  I hit level 60 pretty fast.  I grouped sometimes in the scorned dungeons of Karnor's and... *gasp*.... Velks.  Lanaya never went on a Vox or Naggy raid.  Nor a VS raid.  Nor a Trak raid.  I've barely been to the old world planes.  Haven't even done efreeti.  You would probably laugh behind your hand at my lack of sk33lZ when I missed a mez because I'm too busy yapping in group chat. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You'd think seriously, like another monk used to tell me on a daily basis, that I suck as an enchanter, lol, and probably because of all the reasons I listed above.   I fully admit I am far from the best enchanter, but I have fun, people have fun with me, I enjoy the time I spend playing in game, mistakes and all.<br>
<br>
But what you wouldn't know, unless I told you, was that I'm on my third incarnation in EQ now.  I'm not a newb.  I've done Vox, Naggy, Efreeti, Trak, VS, Sev, Gore, Tal, Wuoshi, KD, Kland, Zland, W and NTOV, etc etc etc... over, and over, and over, as server firsts, and then over and over and over and over again.  /yawn.  Been there done that, as the saying goes.  Do Vox and Naggy again for experience and learning? HAHAHA.  You couldn't pay me to.  Open planes raids? /snooze.  Spend loads of time at level 50-52 doing all the old world raid encounters to pad my EQ resume and make myself &quot;acceptable&quot; to the old-schoolers like yourself who look down on those who haven't done them with their current characters? HAHAHAHAHA.  I can't be bothered.  Deal with it.<br>
<br>
My point is, you don't know the backgrounds of many of the people who you seem to be dismissing as the &quot;new&quot; level 60's.  And not only that, but as said before, the game takes less skill than you would like to make it seem.  Having seen high end content (all of it besides the latest expansion), I can pretty much say in all honesty that they're pretty much the same, and once you've done it once, there's nothing to it after that.  Yeah yeah, people will say that Luclin is different! The encounters actually take skill and thought!  Well they said that when Kunark came out, and Velious came out too.  Nothing really new under the sun in EQ.<br>
<br>
I wonder what the ubers would think if they knew that someone they thought of as an unskilled newb who levelled fast to 60 laughed behind her hand at some of *their* tactics that she saw?  Just a bit of private poetic irony there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, be careful about making generalizations... and be careful about looking at the past with too much of a rosy hue behind those glasses.  The past wasn't always better. . .  and the newb you are thinking of as unskilled today may be the cleric saving your ass when your guild recruits them next week. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I've been playing for years now, with my first character I was a newb, nobody twinked me, I worked long and hard just to buy myself a Lockjaw vest.  I took the time to learn how to play my character.<br>
<br>
As time went on, I wanted to play a monk, so I did.  No, I didn't want to suffer through all the aspects of being a newb, and the finer parts of growing with your character aren't the same the second time around.  I twinked, and powerleveled, but I also took the time to ask questions and learn how to be a good monk, and I was very good at it.  <br>
<br>
Then, the ranger... same story, unbelieveably twinked, but I spent lots of time asking questions, learning how to play.. and I am confident that I know what I'm doing.<br>
<br>
Generalizing is bad.  There are a LOT of great players who were PL'd and twinked, and there are a LOT that suck.  I have played with 'old school' players many times who surprise me with their lack of skill and knowledge.  <br>
<br>
I guess I just get really annoyed by the high &amp; mighty, elitist attitude of some people.  You may be good, and the way you shaped and formed your skills and character may have been great for you, but it doesn't make someone who does it differently wrong.  <br>

<br>
Some of the best players I have ever been around have been PL'd by a friend, or geared up by a RL bud.  And similarly, many of the worst players I have ever seen have been around forever.  There really is no magical formula for what makes a good player.  Some are good, others are not.  It comes down to listening skills, attentiveness and your ability to interact with others.  These are qualities that not everyone will possess.  But to go so far as to say that &quot;EQ is tough&quot; is ridiculous.  EQ is a lot of fun, it passes many hours of time for me where I would have been doing things that were definitely not constructive.  EQ is about social interaction and achievement, not prodigy genius or superior hand-eye coordination.  <br>
<br>
If levels /= &gt; *, sac yourself to the low-50s and see how many of the things that you enjoyed that you are unable to do now.  If you can do that and still tell me that the levels are not important, I'm interested in hearing it.  I'm level 59, and by your generalization, I probably suck and don't have a clue how to play my class.  This is my first character, and I was 'twinked' by early Velious standards.  A good friend gave me all the things a young Paladin could need, and I leveled to 50 in around 10 days played.  <br>
<br>
I know that anyone that has grouped with me knows that I play my class well.  Is it so hard to believe that someone who was twinked from day one could be?  If you really want to put your generalization to test, group with me sometime, and you'll see why <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> some</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of us level so quickly and days played is a poor yardstick when measuring ability.<br>
<br>
There will always be varying levels of skill, and it will never have anything to do with the gear you are wearing, the level you attain, or the amount of time you have played.  I, for one, would rather be level 60 so I have the freedom to do other things besides xp'ing all the time.<br>

Given enough time 90% of the population can build up enough knowledge, experience and loot to overcome any given encounter.  EQ is not rocket science, heck it's not even grade 9 math.<br>
<br>
Gimpifaction?  I'm all for it.  This was meant to be a GAME, a diversion.  Considering that most games have an expected play time of ~100 hours, and that many level 60 approaches the 100 played days, I'd wager to say that EQ is too much of a time sink.  <br>
<br>
I do not begrudge Tani's purist attitude towards the game, in fact it is probably the fastest way to climb the knowledge curve.  However, I also do not begrudge the chap who gets home from work tired and just wants to whack a few spiders and see measurable experience gain.<br>
<br>
Besides, does it really matter if you see a whole slew of level 60's?  I'd be surprised if Tani had to interact with even 5% of level 60's on the server outside of her guild.  I'm sure some of this is the watering down of the meaning of being level 60.  It seems to lessen our accomplishments given that others achieve it easier than we did (yes, I endured the hybrid penalties, lack of hunting spots, lambent to 60, etc... hardships).  However, I repeat, who are we playing for, ourselves or to receive praise and admiration from others?<br>
<br>
Only my friends' opinions of me matter to me.  Everyone else can think I'm a gimp bard/cleric for all I care.  Personal satisfaction with and having the my friends' confidence in my knowledge/ability is all that really matter.<br>

Want to make the game require skill?  Remove the taunt skill.  Take autoattack out.  Remove feign death.  Take evade back out.  Give lay on hands a casting time.<br>
<br>
It'll never happen, because &quot;hard&quot; games don't make money.  Perhaps they'll make a server for it, with no movelogs.  You can bet your ass I'll transfer.<br>
<br>
It'll never happen though, because then the average 13 year old with his mom's credit card won't be able to door sploit naggy, and Sony would lose 80% of their business. <p><center>

I'll take a lower level who won't screw up over a higher level who will any day. I think this is what the rant was aimed at, rather than just being a fast leveler (which is fine). <br>
<br>
Simply put, velious/luclin, even kunark high end zones should not be where you cut your teeth on raiding. Because although EQ does not take a huge amount of skill to play, you do need some basic knowledge of what to do and not do with your class on a raid, knowledge which you may not have if you've gone from lvl 1 to 60 without attending a single raid or other activity that could have slowed your leveling a little. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20820">Ulaian Moonleaf</A> - Warder <BR>
