Time to go to Hate again.<br><br>The raid will take place on Monday May 6, port ups will begin shortly after 6pm PST. Please gather in SRO at the wizard spires at the appointed time for consideration for inclusion. If you sign up, please consider yourself comitted to five hours from 6pm PST. (( 9PM Eastern 8PM Central 7PM Mountain 6PM Pacific ))<br><br>I will be taking five groups as a firm limit. Thirty people are enough to handle everything that hate can throw at you, with plenty of extra power.<br><br>Objectives of the raid are: Kill any demis up, kill maestro if up, clear rev houses, and make a stab at the 2nd floor if there is enough time. Because this is a weeknight, and people often have lives and responsibilities the next day (( including your humble raidleader )) I'd like to move fast to get as much clearing in as possible. <br><br>Depending on the force we have and what kind of signups, we will either be doing a PORTAL or North wall run to SOUTHWEST break. If I have two very butch groups with two wizards to port them, it will be a portal break, if I don't, it will be a standard southwest break.<br><br>If it is a PORTAL break: Two groups will port up and attempt to clear as much as possible around the port-in area. If we win, the rest of the raid will be ported up as quickly as possible, then we will clear to SW camp, and then on to C and maestro. Portal is riskier and requires a lot of meat in those groups that do go up, but I am of the opinion that it is a better choice for speed reasons. Even if there is a wipe, it is easier to recover at portal.<br><br>If it is a SOUTHWEST break: Groups will be ported up one by one, where they will leave the port in building, hit the zone wall and make a NORTH wall run. This means you turn LEFT at the zone wall. Run about half way up the wall, making the zone wall corners until you come to the pile of bodies/FDer that marks the camp. If you aquire aggro, hit the floor and die. There are only two things that matter on a southwest break: Getting a rezzer camped out -and- not training the camp. Once you have camped out, log on to an alt and join the raid chat channel.<br><br>Gem reagents, coffins, port stones, other costs will be covered by me. Any help that you provide in this area would be appreciated but not required. I had a devil of a time tracking down an extra shrink potion last raid, so if you are large it would be appreciated if you could bring along a shrink potion of your own and/or to share.<br><br>What I need:<br><br>*four or five clerics<br>*two pullers<br>*two 55+ warriors or 57+ PAL/SK to act as MA and SA<br>*another enchanter, preferably 54 plus to back me up.<br>*at least one 51+ shaman, but I would prefer two, to do slows and buffs.<br>*wizard(s). At least one, two would be great.<br>*enought druids to get everyone who can't gate down at the end and to act as support healers and nukers.<br><br>What I would like:<br><br>*an epic cleric would be supa-sweet<br>*a 56+ cleric would be nice<br>*a necromancer in case everything goes to Hell.<br>*I'd like to take ikky versions of shaman and warrior along because I hate seeing those drops rot.<br><br>LOOT:<br><br>*There is one default: If the enchanter epic piece: &quot;essence of a vampire&quot; drops, it will be defaulted to me.<br><br>*There are no other defaults.... with the exception of if you are on the LAST PIECE for an epic. If you are on LAST PIECE, it will be defaulted, or you will roll with all other people of your class that are also on LAST PIECE.<br><br>*Epic drops otherwise will be rolled to anyone of the class that puts in for it.<br><br>*Rogue book will be open rolled to all rogues that need it, assuming that it is popped.<br><br>*There is NO last piece of armor rule. There is no special rule for robes or BPs. I don't like last piece rules, because I've seen it be abused, and not having one bypasses that opportunity for abuse handily.<br><br>*Armor drops will be handled as such: Anyone who is interested in a particular drop may roll if they are of the appropriate class. Once you have won a piece, you are out of rolling until either everyone in your class has won a piece -or- the piece is going to rot because no one who is able to roll wants it. <br><br>*Planar weapons, shields, wands, other shwag doesn't count towards armor rolls, it is rolled to anyone who can use it that wants it.<br><br>*Mundane money items will be held until the end of the raid, where they will be distributed fairly to those that didn't win anything all night. Diamonds and Blue Diamonds will be rolled openly to the raid. You must be there to the end of the raid to win.<br><br>*I will take one share of money items (( as if I didn't win anything )) and one blue diamond, and any spare change that drops (( usually 500pp or so )) to help cover my costs for the evening. Any extra costs I'll eat.<br><br>Please sign up in this thread, include your character name, level, class and hate experience. Priority will go to people that I've raided with before, and whose skills I'm familiar with.<br><br>Edit 5/3:<br>--------<br><br>One final loot rule that I didn't address and which came to mind:<br><br>MQable epic drops where there are no classes that can use them present will be held by me... assuming that it would be in any way possible for me to complete the MQ.<br><br>Other than that, we're doing nicely on signups. Will post a tentative roster sunday evening.<br><br>Edit 5/6:<br>---------<br><br>Here is a very tentative roster:<br><br>OLENARI  [ Fearless Leader ]<br>Trap  [ Puller ]<br>Lumineuse [ MAL ]<br>MT<br>Ceffwina <br>Lynicia <br><br>THOARN <br>Wulvena <br>SA  <br>TA  <br>Jekrnu [ SLOW ]<br>Eras <br><br>DOOMSINGER <br>Caladaar <br>Enchanz <br>Neutrino<br>Quilin<br>Dirmik<br><br>VISSY<br>Clocwork<br>Mortaelia<br>Saleex<br>Saradani <br>a cleric<br><br>LASSO [ SNARE ]<br>Donimator<br>Keele<br>fourth warrior<br>Terrek<br>a cleric, brell knows I don't have any shortage of those on raid day.<br><br>Again, because you show up here or you signed up doesn't give you a certain position on the raid. Circumstances, people not showing up, people showing up, all change things.<br><br>I don't have any options that I am really familiar with for assists, so I'm going to make that decision based on what I've got LFG in SRO at raid time, and after inquiring directly of the warriors there about their skill and experience.<br><br>I'll see you all in SRO, I'll probably only be on 2 hours before raid time rather than three.. because I have a RL errand to do after work, but I'll be there. ;)<br><br>FINAL<br>--------<br><br>Well, we had the usual assortment of people sign up and not show up, but my magnetic powers of attraction gained me a new set of minions to crush kill and slaughter.<br><br>After some futzing around, we got everyone to run to a SW camp by way of north wall. Most of the clerics made it, and rezzes proceeded apace. Drops were kind of rotten, a shield here a ikky bracer there, a paladin sword of Suck over there, grats sendador on indy bracer and a cleric shield and arms.<br><br>Move to forge Avatar of Abhorrance, boom boom boom, (( rogues made out like bandits they are overall. No bp for vissy, though. )) then a while after that and a cleric BP we got the slow train (( were you get 2 more mob than you can kill right away repeatedly just a little bit faster than you can kill them for five-odd mins )) from somewhere which resulted in a fun wipe. Clerics camped and we got our act back together after some lessons in patience.... <br><br>(( the lich will wander off, just contemplate nothingness ))<br><br>Then we cleared to the organ hall. Trap picked up maestro after that was done, and I single pulled him... then sucked all six of the notes from his trouser flute because the raid would have had no idea that he was coming, although if we had been lively there would be no reason not to pull him to forge.<br><br>Well after that musical interlude.... we moved into the hall and rode the Mistress of Scorn like the ho bag she is. She was so impressed with with the quality of our spanking that she cracked upon her festering legs like a tollbooth being fed a counterfeit coin and spat up a Shattered Emerald of Corruption. Grats Lasso on the final piece for Earthcaller.<br><br>Maestro next. Four mean guards, and trap can't split them off. I wander in and casually single pull maestro again (( oh well, i guess trap helped a *little* =D )), where the MT promptly dies. /mourn Ninhya. Oh well, we ate him anyway. grats trap on the mempo, grats destroy on six note blade.<br><br>Demi number three, the coercer, gets the stuffing beat our of her, and she grudgingly doles out a enchanter crown and legs. Must have hurt her terribly for enchanter armor to acutally drop in hate. Grats Enchanz on crown and legs from an earlier drop, grats me on legs.<br><br>Hand goes on a little running spree, warps or gates back to the organ hall and decides to become a Very Unpleasant Hand, who eats more people in the raid than Maestro did, but we triumph. Grats Kazooie on Hand of the Maestro.<br><br>Then we had enough. Non-winners got 3 good money items, there were plenty of BDs and Ds so that everyone that stuck around for the final split got one. I had 9 rubies knocking around, which will at least put a small dent in my peridot bill.<br><br> <p><center><BR><img src="http://www.velvet.net/~benton/journal/EQ000322.gif"><BR><small>[60 Enchanter] Olenari (Gnome)<BR>blowing your mind for sixty levels.</small></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uultravoices.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ultravoices</A> at: 5/6/02 11:28:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/utoady911.showPublicProfile?language=EN>toady911</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Secret Cow Level</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/27/02 8:21:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2267.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OPEN HATE -- Monday 5/6 6pm PST -- Olenari Leads</span><hr size=1>  I'll be there.<br><br><br><br> <p>Lasso MonsterMagnet<br>57 Outrider<br><a target="new"href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=58001">My Magelo Profile</a><br><a target="new"href=" http://www.eqnow.com">Proud Member of Auxilium</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ucarolsue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carolsue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here...get out</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/27/02 8:44:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2267.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/cyks/redshoes.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OPEN HATE -- Monday 5/6 6pm PST -- Olenari Leads</span><hr size=1> I would like to go, 52 warrior...<br>if there is no need for me, let me know and I can bring my 53 chanter<br><br>edit, forgot to add hate exp...<br>warrior 12+ times<br>chanter 1 time, with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ucarolsue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carolsue</A> at: 4/29/02 9:20:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uceeffwina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceeffwina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/27/02 8:55:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2267.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OPEN HATE -- Monday 5/6 6pm PST -- Olenari Leads</span><hr size=1> I like to go please, and since I'll be unemplyed by then, I won't be late <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Ceeff<br>Officer of Storming Vengeance<br>54 Seasons of Wandering <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=149698"><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~seattlebam/_uimages/CeeffSigA.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/umiramicha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miramicha</A>&nbsp;
