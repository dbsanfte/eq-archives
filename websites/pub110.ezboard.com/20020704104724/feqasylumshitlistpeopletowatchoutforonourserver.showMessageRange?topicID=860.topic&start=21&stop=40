<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
The original poster said he did train in their post. Several additional people have also posted that he trained.<br>
<br>
Jannaka wouldn't have logs of *anyone* training...unless it was directly witnessed by her period. That's why they can only take action on direct intentional training they actually <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> see</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. So her statement that she has no logs of it isn't proof of anything...other than she didn't witness it. /shrug.<br>
<br>
The story is still coming out, however several people have stated that not only did he threaten to train, but also actually did train. That's enough for the shitlist.<br>
<br>
At this point it time it's not being removed. Should additional information be offered, that may change. <p><a href="http://marian333.livejournal.com" target="_blank">

Nope, but it's been what? A day? There's more than enough to give it time. Also that request was prior to about 3 other posters also saying he trained, they were there.<br>

<br>
Not everyone logs. However, there's information in the first posters logs. And some screenshots too. That coupled with the statements of several other players who also saw him saying the same things, and training, is somewhat damning.<br>
<br>
It's more than enough to leave it up here pending additional information.<br>

<br>
We have of course stated even in the rules of the shitlist that we strongly suggest people attempt to work this out with the people involved...then the guilds. It's not required though. It would help quite a bit, and hopefully resolve things before it ends up here some times, but it's a courtesy only.<br>
<br>
It's also been what a day?<br>
<br>
Also, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> NUMEROUS</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> times people do /report incorrectly.<br>
<br>
The correct format is just like a screenshot. You must scroll down so the chat you want to send is visible on your screen. It sends the last 10 lines or so that are visable. Then the correct format is /report &lt;PLAYERNAME&gt;<br>
<br>
Fuck that up, and there's no report Jannaka is going to have.<br>
<br>
So it's absolutely possible that both sides are being truthful. That the player did report him admitting training, and that you talked with Jannaka who had no record of it. If they reported it incorrectly, she wouldn't have the record of it. <br>
<br>
Also you can only use the /report command once per zone. It will not reset until you zone again.<br>
<br>
As to the rest, it's nice when people have logs and screenshots, it often makes determining what really happened much easier. Most people don't run constant logs. You'd think after all the bullshit I've seen in game I would, but I rarely do when I play. /shrug. Someone having a log that doesn't start until the tail end of shit doesn't shock me. And people not having logs or screenshots isn't shocking either.<br>
<br>
And finally the shitlist is rarely 100% proof positive. It's not a court, and generally you don't have the shitlistee admitting they acted like an asshole. (Generally, some seem to enjoy gloating about it /roll eyes)<br>
<br>
As I said, there's been more than enough posted here to warrent it remaining up here for now. That may change if additional information comes to light. People, as always, should make up their own minds on the situation. However it meets the requirements for shitlisting for now.<br>

<br>
However, what I AM going to say is that I do not at all appreciate the accusations you are throwing at one of my members, Tyral.  As Whiteshade said, I too would have preferred he taken it to your boards first.  Unfortunately, though, he did not.  Does that mean he has a hidden agenda?  No.  It merely means he was upset and has never shitlisted someone before, so he did not know the exact protocols that are SUGGESTED (not required) he follow.<br>
<br>
I do not blame you for trying to defend one of your own.  If the situations were reversed, I would probably be up here defending my member as well.  However, trying to defend your guildmate by pointing fingers and insinuating mine is the one that did something wrong or has some ulterior motive when YOU have no proof of that is not something I will stand for. <p><center><a href="http://www.9realms.com"><img src="http://www.techniartist.com/9realms/images/tira_sig2.jpg" border="0"

Seems that Tyral doesn't mind dragging everyone else on this SL through the dirt over and over again, but when it comes to someone in his guild he sure does backtrack real quick and starts searching for excuses and trying to get the threat locked.  I think you should look back to this SL'ing from now on before you post on every thread.  <br>
<br>
Just want to use an old quote that I found of yours Tyral: <br>
<br>
&quot;The guy fucked up. Under the rules of the shitlist, this remains here.<br>
<br>
It's pretty simple. I don't give a damn how popular the guy is. He did something with ill intent and now he has to pay the price for it.<br>
<br>
Quit trying to debate it. Quit trying to get the thread locked. The more you post here, the longer it's going to stay on the first page.&quot;<br>

A.) They do not support training, begging, scamming &quot;Ninja&quot; looting, and DISRUPTIONS TO ZONES OR PEOPLE.<br>
B.) Regular members (post-probation) who break the rules and act dishonorably will be given a warning and all officers will be informed of their actions. A probation period may be given in addition to the warning. The length of which will be up to the officer in charge of the assessment. <br>
c.) A second offense will result in removal from the guild. Major offenses will not be cleared from a member's record ever. The guild cannot tolerate repeat offenders. The reputation of the guild is important to its members and the reputation of its members should be important to themselves.<br>
d.) If a guild member is contacted by a non-member about a dispute with a member of the guild, they are to be directed to an officer if one is online. The guild leader should be contacted if an officer is not online. If no one of authority is available, then the non-member should to directed to the guild message boards to address the issue.<br>
e.)If a dispute is made public over our guild message boards, another guild's message boards, or the Lanys message boards, only guild officers will post in reply. The guild leader can disallow any guild member from posting to the topic. <br>
<br>
     This tells me that whether or not Sammiel trained is of serious consequence, but it's still a fact that he broke one of NYAA's rules (see B disrupting zones and or people)<br>
     It also tells me that the &quot;management&quot; of NYAA should at the very least reprimand said offender. No I'm not telling you how to run your guild, but don't come posting here defending him anymore. Come here and state that you have followed your charter and have reprimanded him.<br>
     It also tells me that poor Sammiel can't come here to defend his own reputation or admit his guilt/appologize.(see E above) I was wondering why the offender hadn't come here to defend himself. I'd rather hear from him personally why he was being a dick in the zone and then, as at least one witness has stated, he trained the zone. Maybe he had a reason like heartland, or maybe he's just a dick. Either way it seems that this rule is meant to squelch members from making the guild look bad. This is both good and bad. I'd like to hear Sammiels version to be honest. But according to your charter this can't happen.<br>
     So, why then is this a valid SL? IMHO if this idiot did what has been stated by a witness.. trained the zone, and if he acted in a manner that was out of line, disrupting the zone and ruining peoples play time then yes it's valid. If its good enough to be an offence of NYAA's guild charter, then why even bother posting on here in his defence? I personally see it as my warning about this dipstick, just so I can stay clear of him with my alts.<br>

<br>
I am not defending Sammiel for obviously causing zone disruption (threatening to train). I am wary, however, of just accepting the idea that he DID train, when only one person has outright claimed that he trained them. With one mob. Which might very well have been an accident, especially in Solb.<br>
<br>
I've seen no logs or SS of his supposed admittance to training. There is a claim that it was /reported to the GM, Jannaka in particular. I've spoken with Jannaka, and she said no such proof was sent to her. She told me she spoke with Sammiel and informed him that threatening to train was &quot;not a good idea.&quot;<br>

Sammiel will be reprimanded for his behavior. The severity of his punishment will be determined by what I and the officers of Nyaa determine actually happened. So far we are clear that he was causing a zone disruption and bein' a general ass. We are not convinced that he trained anyone intentionally.

Although Sammiel's mouthiness was mostly annoying to me (hence, Ignore), intentional training is not something my group wants to deal with when the inevitable death occurrs and people (like the cleric!) have to run back to the camp. Accidents happen often enough, no one needs mean-spiritedness to add to the usual chaos.<br>
<br>
I've met people from Nyaa and have found them to be nothing but helpful, this post is not intended to reflect on the guild. However, even if this issue was dealt with by those trained and guild leaders, it appears that many people believe that the rest of Lanys deserves a warning about Sammiel and his habits. It seems he has a reputation already, because people began moaning and groaning as soon as they noticed he'd entered the zone of Sol B. Sure, worse trains have happened, but the spiteful attitude and obvious premeditation (however sparse the results) deserves notice.<br>
<br>
Here is what I saw. From the log portion, I am only including the OOC chat because the rest is battle spam and irrelevant. (Edit: I already sent my entire log to Nyaa officers)<br>

    If you can't figure out that MANY said he trained at least once, and then threated to do so again later...  You got to learn to read through the whole topic.  I read at least 3 people saying that he did, and read parts of logs in 2 posts relating to that incident already.<br>
<br>
   It is obvious that he went againts NYAA's rules.   And if you keep him in, saying he has been penalized... than you betray the fact that you stick to your rules.  I was in the Uber guild in SZ on the Good team...  Seen a few people trying to get out of the Guide line...  These people also ended up jumping from Guild to Guild cause they were screw ups.   Is that what you want to keep in your Guild ?   Seem that NYAA has an incredible Guild of good people, don't let one ruin it for all the others.  Kick him off the curve. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ulilasie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilasie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/79/2181279.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I <3 Mistmoore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/7/02 8:29:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=860.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sounds good</span><hr size=1> I have a question, does Sammiel by chance have a bard named Riff he used to play as well and used to be in Bloodsong WAYYYYYYYYYYYY back when it was first formed?

Also no one has to take ANYTHING up with a guild before SLing. Could it get things sorted out without ruining someones rep? Yes sometimes. It would also defeat the purpose of the SL. I know the mods reccommend it. I disagree with them.<br>
<br>
The SL is here as a warning to other players. I know it often times turns into a flame fest on said SLee (I myself have flamed a few asses) but taking an issue to a guilds leader/officers nad not posting a SL because you guys say &quot;We'll take care of it&quot; doesn't warn US that the SLee could be someone you might want to avoid. <br>
<br>
No one is SLing your guild. I've grouped with a few Nyaa peeps and I've found you guys to be great. Does that mean if you have someone in your guild who does shit like this I don't want to know about it? Hell no.<br>
<br>
If I pull something like this I do NOT expect Bloodsong to come rushing to my defense. I'm sure they would cause we are a pretty tight group (and Fae would kill me followed by numerous others afterwards). But if I do something this moronic I expect to be on my own for my defense.<br>
<br>
You've said you've seen no evidence of Samm pulling this shit. I say I have yet to see him claim he didn't. Granted its only been four days but ya know what? If I found out I'd been SLed I'd be here as soon as I could log to see wtf was up. Samm has said he thinks the SL is worthless. To that I say glad I never grouped with ya Samm and hope to never have to.<br>
<br>
Anyways I'm going to bed. 21rst Bithdays are fun for your firends, but god damnit my hangover has already started and I think its gonna be ugly.../cry <p>Galarion-Mystic-53-Bloodsong

Nyaa does not support members who make bad decisions and then fail to correct their mistakes. We are proud of our reputation as a fun, but honorable, guild.
