<br>
you prolly dont know me cause we never grouped in EQ or talked more than a &quot;hail,....&quot; but Sodara, my wife in RL, told me a lot about you and Drachenfeuer.<br>
<br>
The whole story makes me sad but more than this : it makes me mad. Im not too familiar with possibilties of hacking and things like that, but for my simple mind there are only 2 possibilities:<br>
<br>
1) The guy, who hacked you has the ability to reach your account dates on Verant's server.<br>
In case of this, this guy or group has got the possibility to destroy EQ, no doubt. He/They can do this with every account.<br>
<br>
2) This guy has access to your PC. <br>
In this case a reformatting and reinstalling should solve some probs, going ahead with a new password for your account of course.<br>
<br>
As I said before, Im not too familiar with those techniques of hacking but I gained some experience out of RL:<br>
<br>
DONT GIVE UP !!!!<br>
<br>
That means: its ok stopping playing EQ out of your own decision, but not being forced by a damn asshole!<br>
<br>

It really pisses me off when I see someone's account hacked. There is nothing to gain by hacking someone's account, and people who do these things are in need of serious help.<br>
<br>
What gets me is, if this does happen, Verants policy is to ban your account, now this blows my mind, you are a paying customer, and the best solution these guys come up with is to terminate your account? As if its not bad enough already, that your hard played hours are lost in a few moments, and instead of being sorry for you, they come up with a brain dead solution of banning your account. That is truly rubbing the salt into the wounds.<br>
<br>
Verant and Sony which they work for? If this is how the pecking order goes, are lacking in customer relations, sure they have a good game, and for every customer they loose, 2 or 3 will replace them. But in this day and age, they will eventually see a ratio like this, for every 2-3 customers lost, they will only gain 1 new customer. It will happen, and when that time comes, and the revenues are way down, they will see the errors of their ways.<br>
<br>
I have only played EQ for a short time, but I like this game, and will continue to play it. But in these few short months I have been on, I have the impression that we are not really valued customers, and more like we are expendable customers. If this practice in poor relations continue, I will eventually pack it in, and find a online game that actually appreciates its customers.<br>

       this post is for Miramicha..... Your thoughts of poor customer service are somewhat true.  THough I must say that from playing EQ and Anarchy Online.....  EQ has a top notch customer service team.  Seriously (and I am not sticking up for VI or Sony....) they have real people you can talk to and real people will call you back with problems.  Anarchy only  just has an e-mail address.  No phone numbers, no human contact and on top of that computer driven responses to inquiries and problems.  How very sad that so many are paying for so much less, even if the game has the potential to be a fairly decent game.....<br>
<br>
        Again I would like to say that I am sorry some idiot hacked into your account and that we all should take heed and put the maximum digits for passwords and not use typical passwords such as birdays, real names, hobbies etc etc....  use a number letter combo which does not repeat said numbers and letters and bring it out to 10 digits if possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umiramicha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miramicha</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/29/01 9:46:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ohhh</span><hr size=1> Sure, we can max out the password with alpha numerics, but if there are programs out there that just read everything you type, it will not matter. <br>
<br>
If my account ever got hacked, and at this time, there is nothing worthwile on it, other than my personal character, I would be really pissed at this organization if the only responce I got was something like this, yes your account have been hacked, we will delete the hackers account. And yes, your account will be deleted as well, for what? <br>
<br>
For what you might ask, being a innocent bystander? For some asshole that has hacked your account, and is laughing, even as his account is deleted as well?<br>
<br>
There is no reason in my eye for someone who is honest and just here to play this game, at XXX bucks per month, to have their account deleted because some asswipe decided to fuck with it. There is no justice in this.<br>
<br>
Im sure that there are instances where someone might transfer all their shit to another character, and claim that someone hacked there account. I am sure they have the tech. to figure these things out, and just deciding that all accounts in question will be purged is just the Lazy Ass way out of things.<br>

      What does matter in this game? Our friendships and the bonds we share. There are an exorbatant amount of people here  that care deeply for you and value your friendship, people whos day to day lives are brightend and enriched by interacting with you. Thats alot more than majority of  people can say on this server.  We can help you get your gear back, no problem, we can help you level, easy, but most of all we all can share more experiences, laughs, time and deepen those bonds that make this game so great.

This sounds to me like somebody got tired of dealing with Tam in game and/or here on the boards. I would be willing to bet someone hacked her account knowing full well this would seal her fate. The 9 failed attempts to log in seems like the final slap in the face.<br>
<br>
Since items are missing, that proves somebody had gotten the password correct. This would clear the notification of failed attempts. After finishing up, they log out and retry false passwords specifically to leave that message up. Sort of a wave goodbye or whatever.<br>
<br>
If they have the knowledge to hack accounts, they likely have the knowledge to not get caught. Thus they just sit back and laugh. Grimly smiling in their self-perceived superiority that they can get the last laugh on you. Reporting is a good idea if you are going to quit, but I don't think they will be truly damaged by it. It just means *one* of their accounts is banned.<br>
<br>
But what the hell do I know. I just would not be surprised, is all. There seem to be at least a few people that, given the capability, would not hesitate to use such tactics. In fact, would probably enjoy it thoroughly.<br>
<br>
Very sorry to see anyone leave in this manner. /wave<br>

The guilty parties need to have justice brought to them. I hope those people that look after accounts can get to the bottom of this and figure out the person, or persons behind this.<br>
<br>
This is theft, it is no different than a stranger busting a window in your home, and ransacking your personal belongings, discarding what they don't want, and stealing the items that seem worthwhile to them. <br>
<br>
I for one, if they do find out who did this,would like to to know all the names of any characters they had on this server, and any other server for that matter. We deserve to know.<br>
