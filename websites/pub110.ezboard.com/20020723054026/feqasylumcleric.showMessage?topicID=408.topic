Not to knock magicians, but it's a pretty simple job, and at high end I was turned into a Call of the Hero whore. I decided to leave Tallon Zek and move to a blue server, I chose cleric so I could always have a group. But enough of my history, no for the question:<br><br>How exactly does Divine Aura work? I have found that if there are upwards of 3 mobs, and the tank needs a heal, it's best I just throw a Superior Heal, take the aggro, divine aura and just run back over across the warrior. I then cancel the DA myself, and do not regain aggro. I always heard people complain that after 18 seconds they were dead. This however is never the case with me. I am only 35, will this tactic work forever?<br><br>Also, are there any really good sites with cleric information that do not have a monthly fee?

HOWEVER, during those 18 seconds, if someone else has surpassed your agro, then they will of course be the focus of the mobs newfound attention. So basically, you just hope that for however long you're invulnerable, your groupmates will throw enough agro onto a mob to knock you out of spot #1, and thus not get beat on any further. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>As for running back across the warrior with the mob, generally distance does have some bearing on agro (on some mobs more then others, as well.) so that tactic is somewhat sound in some encounters, depending on what agro who has worked up.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br>--Dar <p><center><p><map name="FPMap0"><area href="http://http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1285" shape="rect" coords="310, 10, 549, 67"><area href="http://www.fallenlegacy.com" shape="rect" coords="193, 109, 307, 124"><area href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/beqasylum" shape="rect" coords="96, 113, 189, 124"><area href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/" shape="rect" coords="5, 115, 91, 124"></map><img border="0" src="file:///D:/eq_sig_dar.jpg" usemap="#FPMap0" width="550" height="125"></p></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uleanasoulwarden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leana Soulwarden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/7/02 12:31:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Aura and aggro.</span><hr size=1> Actually, I think you misunderstood his statement Lashanna.  I use the exact technique he stated, and it works quite well.  If you DA, then pass close to someone else who has active agro, the mobs will most likely brush off on them.<br><br>In his example, a warrior fighting three mobs.  He heals, and two of the mobs come after him.  He DA's and passes close to the warrior.  The mobs stick back on the warrior.  He is then free to turn off DA and continue his job.<br><br>Now, more particulars about DA.  I believe agro with DA works similar to distance from mobs.  It doesn't remove you from the hate list, but temporarily moves you way down on the hate list.  If you DA when no one is around, mobs will stick to you like glue.  They will stay with you the whole time DA is up, in the same way a mob that is far away from you will continue to chase you.<br><br>However, if you are close to someone else that can take agro, the mobs will transfer to that person.  What this means is that in a fight, DA is a good agro management tool.  DA can be used to transfer agro to someone else.<br><br>Most of the time, the mob will not come back to you when you lose DA or turn it off.  That is because the warrior is continuing to build up agro by fighting the mobs, and agro has a small decay factor in it.  If you do nothing more to piss off the mob, someone else continues whacking on his friends, and you put some distance between you and the mob, then the mob will most likely have someone more attractive to go after.<br><br>However, there are times when mobs will not forget you.  One particular case is when your life is too low.  Say, you get jumped hard by three mobs.  After three attempts, you finally get DA off.  When you do, your life is under a bubble.  Now, you are in trouble.  You are in the realm of low health agro (Mobs will automatically transfer hate to people with low life).  As soon as your DA drops, all mobs that are close to you will immediately attempt to finish you off.<br><br>There is something you can do about this.  If there is a clear space where no mobs are located, you can run away from the group into that space and wait until DA drops.  This is tricky, because you don't want to be too far from the party (such that you agro additional mobs), and you cannot be too close to the mobs that the party is fighting (such that they will come after you when DA drops).  When DA is about to drop, spam heals on yourself until one begins casting.  If you did this right, then you will be healed and can return to the battle.  If you did it wrong, or.....  mobs summon, you are certain to die.  But then, you were going to die anyway.<br><br>Sometimes, in rare cases, a mob just doesn't seem to like me much.  I really did nothing to piss him off, honest.  He just decided to beat in my head for no good reason.  <br><br>Example:  Every so often in Hate, there will be a revenant that decides it hates me.  I find out when it charges past 20 tanks in order to come after me.  Generally, I tank it for a bit waiting on a chanter to mez it.  If I need to heal someone, or my health drops too low, I DA.  The rev takes off.  I wait a couple of seconds, click off DA and continue my job.  <br><br>Jolly on the spot the rev returns.  Now, I know I have a life long buddy  (either his life or mine).  When my task is over, I pop DB.  Assuming all is going well in the fight, I let DB run it's entire course hoping one of two things happen, the rev gets engaged by someone or mezzed or the rev takes a liking to someone else.<br><br>I know that this particular rev really won't forget me.  It has demonstrated just how persistant it is already.  Therefore, when DB drops, the rev is back like a bad penny.  I then control him with stun/root method.<br><br>Now, if the raid hasn't been able to lock things down by now such that this rev is under control, then we have bigger problems.  It really doesn't matter if it returns for me at this point.  The real purpose of this story is to show that some mobs cannot be discouraged with DA/DB/root or any other method.  They are just stubborn that way.<br><br>I hope this answers your questions.  I tried not to get too deep into how agro works.  That is an involved subject, and one you need to learn to be a good cleric.  But it is sort of off topic.<br><br>Leana Soulwarden<br>High Priestess<br>Inevitable Storm <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubettyaspoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BettyASpoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/7/02 12:48:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Aura and aggro.</span><hr size=1> I would aggree that you need to learn other ways of aggro management.  Because DA has a 1/2 hr. (or thereabouts?) cycling time, you really should preserve it for  true emergencies, rather than regular group fighting.  Root &amp; atone are generally our primary weapons for controlling aggro.  You should be experimenting with them as much as possible.  Once you gain the ability to Complete Heal this will be even more vital, since you will often gain aggro every single time you heal, especially if there is more than one unmezzed mob, and will not be possible to use DA that often. <p><center><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=31996"><img border="0" src="http://www.neverlore.net/Images/azzmoe.jpg"></a><br><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=31996"><font color="#0000ff">Moerne Shadowbone</a><br></font><font color="#0000cc">Handmaiden of Innoruuk<br></font><font color="#000066">Cursed wife of <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=49011"><font color="#000066">Azzlegog Shadowbone</font></a><br></font><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/bmischief&mayhem"><font color="#000099">Mischief&Mayhem</font></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uleanasoulwarden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leana Soulwarden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/7/02 1:25:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Aura and aggro.</span><hr size=1> Moerne,<br><br>I assure you that you will not get agro every time you cast CHeal.  You do get agro more.  Especially when the spell is new to you, you have to learn how to use it properly and control agro.<br><br>DA is my favorite agro management tool.  It recycles in 15 minutes.  If you are controlling your agro properly and have DA and DB memmed, you will seldom have a time when one or the other spell is not up.<br><br>Atone sucks.  Most of the time, mobs my level have to be atoned 3-15 times before it takes.  They summon, root means nothing (except that it generally makes a mob agro on the closest person).  Use all the tools you have.  Also, at my level, the times DA will save me are probably 1-2 times a week.  The times DA will control agro are 10-20 times an outing.<br><br>Oh yes, and DA is much faster than root.  You will be able to cast it when there is little chance of getting root off.  You also don't have to worry about those nasty resists.<br><br>I'm not saying to avoid root/atone methods of cc.  Depending on what I am fighting and our group makeup, I will use those, though I seldom atone.

I ran about halfway across that big hall, with the Sarnaks all sticking on the Warrior and Wizard. The moment my DA wore off the Battlesmith came running over right through the hall to finish me off.

But it does happen often, and as I said before this is particularly true in a multiple mob situation, and probably you will get aggro often enough to not want to waste your DA on it.  But then that's probably personal preference.  Personally, I prefer to have DA available for true emergencies.  <br><br>And I surprised you have such a hard time getting atone to stick.  I've got a friend with a 60 cleric on Torv, and I've seen him atone mob after mob after mob with hardly any problems, so another group could get XP when they were hunting together.  Sometimes took two casts, but not often. <p><center><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=31996"><img border="0" src="http://www.neverlore.net/Images/azzmoe.jpg"></a><br><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=31996"><font color="#0000ff">Moerne Shadowbone</a><br></font><font color="#0000cc">Handmaiden of Innoruuk<br></font><font color="#000066">Cursed wife of <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=49011"><font color="#000066">Azzlegog Shadowbone</font></a><br></font><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/bmischief&mayhem"><font color="#000099">Mischief&Mayhem</font></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubettyaspoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BettyASpoon</A> at: 6/7/02 11:07:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udrupdm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DruPDM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/7/02 11:28:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Aura and aggro.</span><hr size=1> Leana, thanks a ton.

That is because the warrior is continuing to build up agro by fighting the mobs, and agro has a small decay factor in it. If you do nothing more to piss off the mob, someone else continues whacking on his friends, and you put some distance between you and the mob, then the mob will most likely have someone more attractive to go after.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Note, when taken in context, this accounts for the fact that you will still have agro.  However, your agro has been reduced and others have increased their agro.<br><br>Actually, I suppose this is a good time to discuss how agro works.  Agro has two recognizable factors, which work together to help the mob to determine who to attack, history and environment.<br><br>History factors are the things the player did to anger the mob.  Things that fall in this category are hit the mob, nuke the mob, heal an enemy of the mob, debuff the mob, buff an enemy of the mob, taunt, pick pocket (detected), beg (fail), jolt, etc.  Each action has a hate value (negative in the case of jolt) that is associated with it, and is accumulated.  The total hate degrades over time, but will probably never be reduced to zero.<br><br>Environment is an accumulation of all the conditions that affect whether a mob will attack.  Things that fall into this category are proximity, char level vs. mob level, sitting, natural hatred (based on factors such as race, religion, class, etc.), vulnerability, agro altering spells, etc.  Mostly, if we were to put this in military terms, we’d call this form of target selection “Targets of Opportunity.”  Characters who are nearly dead can be easily eliminated.  Why chase that hated cleric around when there is a nice juicy warrior standing next to you?<br><br>The mob AI evaluates these two factors.  Maybe the cleric has a higher history factor than the warrior standing next to him does.  However, it is not high enough to override the fact that the warrior is easier to hit.  Better yet, two steps away is the int caster sitting down.  His defenses are down and the mob can hit him for massive damage.  These factors are always changing, so the mob may select new targets every cycle.  However, the warrior is always doing his best to make his history factor as high as possible.  He also has proximity agro locked if things go right, since he should be the closest one to the mob.<br><br>DA falls into the environmental factors.  A couple of experimental whacks from the mob and he quickly determines that the cleric cannot be harmed.  Therefore, the cleric is suppressed on the hate list.  It works similarly to the cleric being placed way across the zone.  For the duration of the invulnerability, the mob will leave the cleric alone.  The cleric still has the same history factor he always had.  But, environmentally, he is untouchable.  Therefore, the mob will switch to any suitable target.  <br><br>When DA fades, the environmental factors will return to normal.  The cleric has the same history factor as before, minus a small amount of decay.  The environmental factors almost certainly have changed.  The warrior has been working hard at building a history the mob cannot forget.  The cleric has moved away from the mob in an attempt to eliminate or reduce proximity agro.  Any number of other events have happened to alter the factors the mob has to evaluate in order to decide who he will fight.  <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Soon as DA fades, you pop back up to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  wherever you were </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on that list. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>This statement is incorrect.  You will return to normal agro status, meaning that DA will no longer have an environmental affect on agro.  However, agro conditions will have almost certainly have changed during the time that you were invulnerable, and it will be impossible for you to return to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  where you were </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  on the list.   Instead, you will be placed on the list somewhere else, based on a new evaluation of history factors and environmental factors.  <br><br>This specifically allows you to transfer agro to someone else.<br><br>I hope this clarifies my statement.<br><br>Leana Soulwarden<br>High Priestess<br>Inevitable Storm<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ugarthinsw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>garthinsw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rhag`Mozdeth & Rhag`Zhezum </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/11/02 2:19:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Aura and aggro.</span><hr size=1> let me simplify this a bit guys you are making this way to tough .<br><br>you cast cheal and get say 5 k in aggro . warrior has 3 k in aggro . mob comes after you .<br><br>you hit da and do nothing for 18 seconds <br><br><br>da wears off and warrior now has 6 k aggro while you have 5 k aggro . mob beats on warrior . <br><br>its that simple .<br><br>all the situational arguements mean nothing that is the way it works . da doesnt cause you to lose aggro it just gives everyone else 18 seconds to build more aggro then you had at the time you cast da .<br><br><br>garthin<br>59 cleric<br>The Shadow Order <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uleanasoulwarden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leana Soulwarden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Frogloks</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/11/02 3:55:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Aura and aggro.</span><hr size=1>  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  all the situational arguements mean nothing that is the way it works . da doesnt cause you to lose aggro it just gives everyone else 18 seconds to build more aggro then you had at the time you cast da. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Except that I can DA, run past everyone, turn off DA and have lost the mob.

he should have switched to the next target . it means one of 2 things the amount of aggro you had was very small or was overidden by other factors . this once again has nothing to do with HOW da works . <br><br>and that is what we are talking about . all you are doing by bringing up these different situations is confusing the issue . da works one way and one way only . aggro works totally different . aggro can work very differently from mob to mob in truth . so situations dont give a good indication of how the spell works only how it can be used in those situations . <br><br>dont confuse the 2 issues because they are totally seperate . <br><br><br>garthin<br>59 cleric<br>The Shadow Order <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showMessageRange?topicID=408.topic&start=21&stop=28>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showPrevMessage?topicID=408.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showNextMessage?topicID=408.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.unbeliever.net/images/lanys/postreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.emailToFriend?topicID=408.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.threadControl?topicID=408.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=408.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=408.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub110.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumfrm37">All Other Games<option value="eqasylumfrm35">Morrowind<option value="eqasylumfrm42">Neverwinter Nights<option value="eqasylumfrm43">WarCraft III<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumcleric>Cleric</a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br> <BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"> <a href="http://www.betagamer.com/lanys/">EverQuest Links</a><BR></DIV><BR> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
