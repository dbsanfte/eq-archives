A gm would be able to observe it better than I could.  I will sit him down again, but I find your story suspect.  Especially since your main complaint at first was him reporting you to your guildleader for training him, and when I said I havent heard anything from your guild leader you began telling me other stuff.  On top of everything, another guildy was in the zone, and he did verify that you drew mobs on them but he didnt think it was a problem he just had to use some mana to bust the couple mobs.<br> <p><a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=icecap>Icecap</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/13/01 12:44:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grekin (or Greken) the harrassing dorf</span><hr size=1> Tyral,<br><br>Well using me awesome skills of judgement that you apparently LACK.

To be fair, my group then put themselves in the wrong by taking him up on the duel.  But on this occasion, he /was/ petitioned by a member of my group, and I did report him to an officer of The Code, not because I expected anything to be done, but simply because I wanted to warn them that this member might require watching.

If he chooses to continue this behavior action will be taken, for now hes been instructed in the unwelcomed behavior hes been presenting. <p><a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucendil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cendil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/14/01 4:35:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grekin (or Greken) the harrassing dorf</span><hr size=1> completely off the subject..but holy crap, did your sig always do that thing tarot? <p><img src="http://www.walkersofthewind.homestead.com/files/censig.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/ribbon_small.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spirithowl</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/14/01 11:36:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dreamingwolficon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grekin (or Greken) the harrassing dorf</span><hr size=1> a flash expert from from visions did it for her<br><br>*edit*<br>recently ; p <br>*edit* <p><a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/ribbon_small.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/14/01 11:37:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uplurlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PlurLanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/15/01 10:21:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://store3.yimg.com/I/opane_1650_5987921 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grekin (or Greken) the harrassing dorf</span><hr size=1> kailtor smells. <p><center><img src="http://store3.yimg.com/I/opane_1650_3878626"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udigiwarf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Digiwarf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/17/01 10:18:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grekin (or Greken) the harrassing dorf</span><hr size=1> humm sorry about the anon post guys, also his name is Grekon (i wasnt sure)<br><br>&quot;Quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> that was the last i heard from Dreamingwolf about the situation. needless to say i did leave the guild since greken just couldnt resist lying to them. i didnt know anything else to do<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It appeared to me that the poster was complaining that his guildmates didn't help, so he left the guild.&quot;<br><br>i dont believe you understood me, i dont didnt expect my guild to take up for me or anything, nor did i ask them or involve them in the situation about Grekon concidering he did shutup for the night.
