<br>
1. gems, peridots for clerics n chanters, i heard pearls are needed too..true? for who? any other gems needed? and what is the ave amount people use per raid?<br>
<br>
2.groups, i've been there with 3 and been there with 10. whats a good amount and how many of each class? <br>
<br>
3. rolls, armor is one kinda roll, epic is another.. are weapons a 3rd? <br>
<br>
4. when do you know to call the raid? after such amount of time, or until you get to things the raid cant kill?<br>
<br>
5. drops (pp and money items) well i would guess the pp would go to the leading person to replenish the funds from gems. what about the money items, do they get handed out to people who stick threw the whole raid and dont get a drop, or do they go to raid leader to replenish costs too?<br>
<br>
I'm curious and I am hoping a few people who have lead a fear before could help me with the answers. Thank you<br>

Peridots and jaspers are needed for symbols and runes.  I usually try and bring 3 extra stacks of each when I am leading.  Hand out 2 of the 3 stacks, primarily to clerics since rune is really only needed on the break or during demi/epic mob fights.  Keep the last stack in case people run out.  Only uses I can think of for pearls would be to CoH in latecomers, but if the plane is broken its not really needed (unless doing a north wall break in which case wanderers might still be up).  Suppose clerics might cast death pact too... but honestly not many use that spell that I know of.<br>
<br>
3. groups depend on levels.  If you have mostly 55+ its probably possible to do 2 groups. 60, means 1 group possible.  For most open raids the average level will be 51 or 52 which means you will need a minimum of 3 groups for the normal mobs and more for demis/epics.<br>
<br>
Group balance wise, for the average open raid you want 3 enchanters, though 2 can work in a pinch if one is 55+.  2 clerics.  At least 2 druids and 2 shamans.  2 warriors.  A fairly high level (55+ best) FD puller, either a SK or a monk will do... alternatively I have seen a 60 ranger harmony pull quite well though I am not sure how a lower level ranger would do.  The key to remember here is that Fear has an incredible aggro radius, but this aggro radius decreases as player levels increase.  After these essentials, make about half the raid melee, and half the raid nukers / backup healers.<br>
<br>
Typically I see open raids operate with 5 groups.  6 groups is fine too.  After having done a 7 group raid I never will again because at that size people start having trouble getting at normal size mobs, lag increases exponentially, LD's increase, chatter increases to the point where people start missing raid leader instructions, etc.  Open raids are typically called when total numbers fall below 3 full groups.<br>
<br>
3. Yep, armor and epics are different as are weapons.  Asside from armor and epic items I seldom see people making loads of noise to get in on rolls in Fear.  Stuff that drops there just isn't that great.<br>
<br>
4. Set conditions for calling the raid... Maximum time limit, minimum numbers of people you will operate with, decide if the raid is going to end after achieving a specific objective.  Also recognize that sometimes things just aren't working out right.  It is possible to get a number of folks who just don't get raiding and who will through no fault of their own other than ignorance, and dare I say it, stupidity will cause repeated trains.  If you can't single them out and TL them out of Fear then its best to call the raid rather than spoil everyone's evening with repeated wipeouts.<br>
<br>
5.  Money, money items, and gems to the raid leader is typical if he or she provides peridots.  Fear is very very stingy in comparison to Hate with these, so typically the raid leader will not be able to break even in Fear.  In cases where you have a good night and do break even then you would probably roll away special gems (Blue diamonds, etc).  Don't be too generous though, or if you are a good raid leader, people's enthusiasm for you to do more raids will quickly bankrupt you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1) You need peridots, really, and nothing else. If people can get by with the jasper based symbol (Pinzarn), they can get by without symbol at all. You don't need pearls either, as you won't need to deathpact anyone nor CoH. If your puller demands a mage in his group to CoH when he screws up, get a new puller who actually knows how to pull fear.<br>
<br>
You can save quite a lot on gems if your raiders are good at agro control, as then only the main assist and the enchanters will require symbols for the regular fighting in the plane. Of course this changes for the demis and draco, but you can save several stacks of gems by clerics not symboling every trigger hapy nuker thats afraid he might get agro when he's making a bid to get exp off all the mobs. Yes, that would be the same nuker who's asking for mod rods and twitches, which he should not get either.<br>
<br>
2) Unless you've got a lot of experience breaking fear, you'll want to use at least two groups for this. 2 clerics, 2 chanters, an evacer in each group and the rest tanks and nukers. Bards are great as well, as the better ones can lock down 4 mobs permanently without ever needing mana. Something your enchanters cannot. Depending on the average level of the raid, you may need to add more groups to the break in order to kill fast enough to hold it.<br>
<br>
Once the plane is broken, ie. you've killed most of the roamers on the west wall and around the portal, you can reasonably get by with a single cleric if you need to. As long as this cleric is bound in Feerott. Of course, more clerics are better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Definitely don't ever go above 6 groups in a raid, as Mukhtar said. The zone can handle it, but most people's computers can't keep up with showing that many people at once, cause lag and LDs. Besides your clerics and enchanters, just fill up with melee and casters of any class you want, though you ought to fit a wizard in there to TL people out if you don't manage to clear temple.<br>
<br>
For pulling, honestly any class can do it at 57+. It is a simple matter of knowing the plane. Even when you have a ranger or druid pulling, they will rarely if ever use harmony - the agro range of most mobs in fear is greater than the range of harmony, even at lvl 60. If they're pulling well, its due to them knowing how to go about it. As such, a paladin, warrior or any other class can do it well, if they know the plane. Even a wizard can pull it of well, though i'd recommend having epic for that to avoid being too much of a manasponge <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  When pulling in fear, FD really is not needed at any point except the temple pull. And one can get around that, too.<br>
<br>
3) This is your choice, as raid leader. 100% your decision. Just make sure people signing up know about it beforehand. Generally though, armor, epics and weapons are all seperate rolls.<br>
<br>
4) For your standard open raid, when the majority of the raid has to leave *or* when you've achieved the goals you set out to reach, would be a prudent time to leave. I tend to dislike leaving anything alive there though (well, except for Cazic Thule whom i've yet to have a raid capable of challenging), but thats just me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5) Fear is pretty bad for money item drops, so you'll likely want to keep them all to cover raiding costs. Plat as well, but this is hard to keep track of as so many different people will be looting. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20823">Ulaian Moonleaf</A> - Warder <BR>
