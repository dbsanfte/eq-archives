Nasty guy in general.</span><hr size=1> Daiko:<br>
Damn straight I shifted everything to Hartland.  Except for the fact that I say many times over that Shoot was probably being an asshole, but that still is no excuse to train.  Hartland is the one that trained.  Now if you read what I said, I said nothing, emoted nothing, shouted nothing, ooc'd nothing, until he started training us.  If I had acted the way shoot had, then yes, I would admit fault.  But what fault do I have, as all I did was sit there and wait for MY group to pull to me, not for Hartland to pull.<br>
<br>
Now I wasn't quiet because the same person that started this was slandering my name in the first post by saying I was being a rude asshole because I was drunk, when I hadn't said a damned word in anything except group chat.  And when the hell did shoot admit fault?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm not saying I'm blameless here<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> is this where you say he admits fault?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As I'm sure I could have found a more mature way of dealing with him... but I was too damn tired <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Or is that where?<br>
<br>
I am sorry, but just as shoot said himself, his group did not deserve to be trained, yet Hartland refuses to say, Hey I am sorry.  This whole thing would be resolved if the trainer would come up to a person that had said nothing, did nothing, just sat there and got trained, and all he has to say is &quot;I am sorry I wasn't thinking&quot;  But instead he says I don't care, Talk to a GM.<br>
<br>
Also, yes a GM or Guide might have warned Shoot had they been in zone, but they would not have banned him for it.  If they saw what Hartland did, they might have banned him.  See the difference in severity?<br>
<br>
So, Yes, I have a problem with Shoot, and I have dealt with it.  But the fact still remains, I did not deserve to be trained, and I was.  And Hartland refuses to say anything to me except &quot;talk to a GM.&quot;  His Guild Crimson renegades has the same view.  His leader stated, &quot;Really, I don't care.&quot;  when asked to talk about the situation.  So, where am I left, I am left with Hartland treating me like shit, an ex-guild leader that wants to talk shit, embarass, and generally defame his own guildmates, and people on the message board saying that I am guilty because I don't enjoy having my guild leader talk shit about me publically and I don't enjoy being trained.<br>
<br>
Look at what Aashna posted, the only thing that she has me for is saying that I would shitlist Hartland, at the very end when I was logging, which I then rethought, and logged back in to talk, and to get information on their guildleader.<br>
<br>
So, go ahead, try to assume that I am the guilty one here, with Hartland training.  Try to invision my guilt as I said nothing, didn't spam the zone at all, didn't provoke.  I did nothing and was trained, when I ask that something be done, even as little as an appology, I am told that I am at fault, unfortunately, I am joined by many others, Training is NEVER acceptable.  If it is an accident, then, well no big deal, but when you state that you are going to train someone, and then do, more than once, that is not ever acceptable, and According to the leader of Crimson Renegades, and multiple officers, what hartland did was fine by them.<br>
<br>
Until someone can come up with something to blame me with, Diako, please just take the facts and realize that I am defending myself from what Shoot had said, more than anything else.  I am pointing so much blame on Hartland because he did something that has no excuse, no matter what, and is bannable, and his guild &quot;Doesn't Care&quot;.<br>
<br>
But yes, Shoot is to blame also, he spammed, provoked, shouted profanity, sent tells back and forth saying how he was having too much fun to stop, and in the end he finally says that he isn't blamless, so I guess he deserves all the respect.  Compared of myself, who didn't provoke, didn't spam, got trained, tried to resolve it before the shitlist, and tried to bring the truth to the matter by sending out my log so people could compare them to their own, or read what there was, completely unedited showing all guild and gruop chat.  Yeah, I see your logic how I shouldn't be respected at all, whatever.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/02 1:57:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

I don't think Shoot is an Asshole, mostly cause I hear he apologized about it and even admitted he did wrong.  Below is the quote that got me started, and from what I see, it also got Longfeller going after you in the same way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Yeah, unfortunately my alt was in that group, and you know what, Hartland even said to zone, just put them on /ignore.<br>
<br>
If he had heeded his won advice this would have been fine. But he didn't. This is the problem I have, I don't care how much someone shouts to zone, if they offend me, I put them on ignore. Training over and over, since this wasn't the only incident of him training on us, isn't acceptable.<br>
<br>
Come on people, use /ignore for what it is made for, it doesn't turn off all shouts, it just turns off this one person. You don't get tells, you don't get shouts, ooc, auc, nothing.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
1st, I've used /ignore on someone that was being a pain in ooc/shout... didn't work.  Do you have to zone/log and come back for it to take effect ?<br>
<br>
2nd.  Telling people what to do in response to you or your friend is going to insult very many people in game or in real life.  It's human nature to hate people telling us what to do.  We Goddamn do what we want, when we want.  And if someone wants to act like an asswhole cause of /ignore, fuck em.  I would have petitioned them if it bothered me that much, I wouldn't play a /ooc tag bulshit.  And I'd be on Sullon zek if I wanted to train someone...  Believe me, I remember some trouble makers doing that every night in Everfrost at permafrost entrance...  You'd have 1-2 IG's waiting for you when you zoned...  BAM!  ouchy.  No rules there.  hehe  Never agreed that Training was right in here.<br>

Binnar is NOT saying this : People can do whatever they want and if you don't like it, put them on /ignore<br>

We are not on Sullon Zek, and therefore it isn't acceptable, and since I am not the one making an ass of myself in zones, please do petition people that need it.

Training is an immature to handle any situation.  Well, any harm to others is an immature to handle a situation.<br>
<br>
eitherway, this has happen weeks ago...  Issue being dragged for ever on a Mute point by now.<br>
<br>
Hartland handled it wrong, but is not a person that I would consider Shit listable.  Why ?   Cause he did an Eye for an eye...  Well, he did way worse to you guys of course which makes him look bad.  But One in your group was out to piss the hell out of him.   People in this forum being SL are ass holes, they don't need a reason to be just that... an Ass hole.   You can't push someone, and then bitch cause they retaliated too hard.<br>
<br>
If Shoot really did apologize to Hartland, and vice versa... I think you all should just handle this out of forum (Should have been done that way from the beginning).<br>

That's why I have no problem with this being here and staying here right at the top of the list.

<br>
Going through the whole thread, you got more heat than Hartland.  IT's probably cause you were so defensive, and lenghtly at that.<br>
<br>
Some people thought Shoot deserved it...   Shoot ain't back here... Who else was there when it happened, you...  And more you got defensive, and more you got the heat that was intended to Shoot...  It's like pouring more oil on the fire thinking you'll drown it...  doesn't work too well.<br>
<br>
I probably did take what you said the wrong way, but it doesn't change that I don't appreciate that some people think that /ignore is a Have to if someone decides to annoy a whole zone.  Eitherway,  this has been long enough.  You can keep this topic in here for a few months, won't hurt Hartland a bit.  You might want him to get hurt, but it won't.  Mostly cause of all the inner battles in this topic.  If I see Hartland out there and we both were looking for a group..  I wouldn't fear him being an Asshole.  He's Human, and made a bad call.  We all do.  Again... His bad judgement was a response...  Again why many called the Group hypocrits.  Don't make it a vendetta...  You've probably caused more attention to you then to Hartland in this whole thread.<br>
<br>
Oh.. .and sorry for jumping all over you as for the /ignore.  I mis-read it, and never went back until I posted the quote here.

and by the way, you refrencing to me trolling, you can kiss my ass. because i stop at my regular forums once a day, so if you call that trolling, then yeah i guess i am a 400 pound big green machine. <p><p align = "center"><img

   That reminded me of a few topic I've had to get over with my kids...  My oldest one keeps doing things she shouldn't do, and one of those things is Stealing.  I tried to explain to my 2 youngest that if Their sister is doing something that is &quot;Wrong&quot; and they are going along with it...  They are as much to blame as She is.  It's still not sticking...   But I have hopes.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
    Now... how to differenciate &quot;Protecting&quot; their ass, with Tater tale...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

   As I said before,  Guilt by association sucks...  And it's the main reason Binnar got the heat.  If he would have written this complaints instead of Shoot, it might have had a different flavor.  Oh well.  Still think this post is bogus.  Hartland was wrong...  But he's not an Ass Hole that causes other people to suffer across the board.  He had a bad judgement call once, and apologized to the main instigator.  Binnar, if you weren't so strongly accusing him... he probably would have appologized to you.  There are 2 sides to everthing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font> <BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
