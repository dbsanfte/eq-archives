What VI will do in this situation I haven't a clue.<br>
<br>
Realistically this wasn't hacked, he gave him permission to use the account. Obviously he didn't give him permission to delevel the character and delete gear. Dunno what they'll do though, and it will also probably depend on who he talks to since IMHO they're not always consistant on what they do.<br>
<br>
Some people get restored, some don't. One situation where IMO I think the player deleted themselves in a hissy fit though they claimed they didn't...they got restored. So who knows. /shrug<br>
<br>
They usually will ban the other person though, I've seen that happen more than once. <p><a href="http://marian333.livejournal.com" target="_blank">

J, you then transferred the acct to your own credit card and continued to play him.<br>

Now B wants him back.  Yup,  HIS account.  NP.  However, the shittiest thing I have EVER seen in my 2.5 years playing EQ was the deleveling and the breaking the epic.<br>
<br>
The &quot;OH I did it so I can do what I want with it&quot; excuse is full of CRAP.  You didn't just screw Brent, Jugs, you screwed every other player that Brent might have grouped with.  You screwed me, you screwed your neighbor, you screwed people you didn't even know.  Cleric Epics are the MOST powerful pieces in the game.<br>
<br>
I SURE hope that this is not the Jugs I met in Minneapolis (Fan Faire).  I had a VERY high opinion of that Jugernaut, and thought he was well respected on the server.  I say this, because I would NEVER group with someone so vindictive and hateful.<br>

I took the time and equipment i invested into bret.  Bret and ill quote,  &quot; The epic is a waist of time.  I dont need or want to do it.  I on the other hand.&quot;  Since i did ALL the epic peices i destroyed this peice of armor since i did work on it.  <br>
<br>
I destroeyd the levels that i obtained as bret and left him with levels that he earned.  I took in account the leveles he earned from 54-56 and 45-48 and since i did 30-45 i left him at 44.<br>
<br>
To say i was wrong, i doubt it.  To say we were friends, sure.  To give, and take continuasly, and one time time the person actuallly deciedes to keep the object, then the person uses legal tatics to take back, well thats wrong too.  <br>
<br>
So in a sence, when i gave him back the account each time he gave it to me, i somewhat deserve to watch myself loose the character that i put s m,uch time in. <br>
<br>
Give a mouse a cookie, and he will want the glass of milk.  <br>
<br>
This saying can go for both of us in both situations.  <br>
<br>
De-leveling was a way to detach the levels that i made,  with the leveles he did.  It was way to clear the slate clean for me and make it so that i dont have any connection w/ him anymore.  This was hard to do, however its done.  Destroyed the gear that i aquired and will give him what is needed that i did not, since i did destroy planar armor before, to make room for the bank.<br>
<br>
Bret be able to understand this and hopefully time will let him see, as well as many of you, that i did do the right thing.  Never thought a friend would take back an account givin multiple times, but i guess thats life.<br>
<br>
Bret i invested multiple RL $$, And as usual i probably wont see any of the $$ you ever owe me.  Thats fine, however you cant blame me for being quite upset since the fact that your debt is not outstanding towards me, but other distant aqauntances as well.<br>
<br>
As i said, call me clear things up.  I know that you will understand my reasons for de-leveling.  Talk to me and let get this thread locked.  <br>
<br>
As for the people who think i was wrong, I can say your not the real bret, with explainations, im sure well see eye to eye and come to a agreement.  Bret will no longer be in my control, he can play again I guess his character.  If you really want to talk and clear things up talk to me when im online, and im sure you can clear things up w/ me or bret.  <br>
<br>
Ty for your time, and hope that everthing works out for the best.<br>

<br>
This is even worse.  It would seem that rather than returning the char the same way you found it, instead you will be returning the char in a lesser form than you originally received it.  You destroyed the armor you acquired, but you also destroyed the planar armor the character had before?<br>

First of all, saccing him down to 44 because of levels you earnt was stupid, you do realize the higher the level, the more exp you have to get? So you basically sacced him more then you should have. Then you destroyed the armor you got whle playing his character. YOU played his character HE didn't. He doesn't have to pay you for playing HIS character, YOU could have said No I don't want to let it go inactive. You Chose to take the account and now you did something thats so low it makes the SL'ers look good.

Last I checked, 44 is a few levels shy of even porting into Hate.  He's going to have to level two levels without gear to even get there.  Once he does get there, what are your intentions?  He now has to waste time getting armour that was already his.  As a Lvl 60 druid and lvl 46 cleric can hardly duo Hate, you are going to waste the time of the guildmates/friends who have to spend their stones, their time, their experience to obtain gear that is only lost due to your pettiness. I have no problems with deleveling him back to the level he was when you took over the character.  I don't have much of a problem with you even destroying the epic, though it is a disservice to those clerics who were racing for those pieces at that time.  I do have a problem with taking a fully functioning character, and returning a crippled one.  You have robbed both him and the other people who are going to have to spend their time fixing your actions.  I'm rather glad I am no longer guilded with you, you embarrass me as both a player and a person.<br>

If Bob was paying for the car while he was using it and now Tim wants it back, Bob can just go out and get another car.  With Everquest, Jugg can't just get a level 60 cleric (not to mention all the equipment).<br>
<br>
I have taken several breaks from EQ ranging from 1 to 6 months.  During one of my longer breaks perhaps I should have given my password to someone so they could take over my account, level me up, get me some high-end gear, finish my epic, etc.  Then I could return to the game (we all do) and reap the rewards that someone else gained for me.  This is not a realistic expectation for me to have.  If I wanted to keep everything, the person who got the equipment for me would probably expect some form of compensation.  At the very least I would offer to pay the $10 monthly fee for the months I was gone.  I wouldn't simply hit the Lany's Shit List and start demanding my character back in his new form.<br>
<br>
I don't know all the details of what happened between these two RL people, their friendship, their EQ characters...and neither do you.  Alot of people are passing judgement based on emotions and not the facts.<br>
<br>
I like Jugg (&quot;new Bret&quot;), but &quot;old Bret&quot; does have the account info and can take it back whenever he wants to.  I feel bad for Jugg, spending all that time and RL$$ supporting and maintaining the account, paying the monthly fees, etc.  But facts are facts and &quot;old Bret&quot; can take his account back any time.<br>
<br>
So I think what Jugg did was just fine.  Jugg said: &quot;Destroyed the gear that i aquired and will give him what is needed that i did not, since i did destroy planar armor before, to make room for the bank.&quot;  So as the character advanced, he got rid of the older equipment.  Who doesn't?  Jugg also left new equipment on the character to replace those items that were destroyed.  And he de-leveled the character back to 44, taking into account the levels that Jugg gained vs. the levels that &quot;old Bret&quot; gained.<br>
<br>
It sounds like Jugg did everything he could to put the character back to the exact way he found it.  Yes that means that Jugg destroyed the epic that *he* worked hard to get.  It has nothing to do with you people out there.  Someone had the audacity to claim that this action &quot;screwed every other player that Brent might have grouped with&quot;.  Oh please.  Like this disagreement has anything to do with you personally.<br>
<br>
I would think &quot;old Bret&quot; would be here thanking his old RL friend for putting his character back the way it was found.  After all, &quot;old Bret&quot; stated that &quot;I am a firm believer that nothing in life was free.&quot;  So you'll get your character back the way he was found: under 60, lesser gear, no epic.  Enjoy the game and welcome back.<br>

Except that Jug didn't level Bret all the way to 60, and destroyed armor that Bret already had to make bank space. <p>[55 Blackguard] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96718" title="Magelo profile">Harabakc Taintedblade</a> (Dwarf)
