I saw someone 30ish playing with the Undead Cyclops.  So, out of habit I went up to the mob and tossed an AC debuff/slow/AGI debuff on it and started chain mezzing it.  It aggro'd me and the 30ish kept whacking it.<br>
<br>
I wasn't doing any damage to it (Because I didn't want to KS it).  I was just tanking it and debuffing it.  So, in /ooc the guy yells &quot;GET OFF OF IT&quot;.  LOL.<br>

Like the cleric who came along when I was kiting a cyclops in OOT... and rooted the mob... This was when snare and root did not stack.  Root breaks snare.  Then his root breaks... Cyclops come charging... bang bang, dead druid...<br>

Mr Cleric tells you, &quot;Sorry, I was just trying to help, you looked like you needed it!&quot;<br>

So, while your heart was in the right place, I can see why maybe the 30something was annoyed.

You acted in a manner that would cause most reasonable people to become nervous or uncomfortable. The AC is a very contested mob with a bad history. Kill stealing is expected and feared. You used that against someone to get some kicks.<br>

I was curious what other peeps thought, and the reaction is mixed as I thought it would be.  <br>
<br>
I see where I was partly wrong, so it is no biggie, it was just funny that he flipped.  Instead of doing an /ooc it all caps (which tells me he was frenzied at the keyboard), I think he could have just as easily done a  &quot;/say I got it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh well.  Frankly, I like to PL a bit.  I don't spend hours doing it, but if I am running through a lowbie zone, if I see some peeps I lend some tanking and damage.  I just remember how grateful I was when peeps did it for me.  I remember Lydian helping me get a yellow when I was a &quot;Bronze Bard&quot; as he called me.  <br>
<br>
And as a note to the druid that got killed because of a cleric... I understand.  As a bard I would kite things around and people would help.  But, there's a diff between someone standing there duking it out.<br>

==================================<br>
Nice, you make an asshole move and then come here to gloat about a nooooob that dared accuse you.<br>
==================================<br>
Gosh, I didn't come to gloat.  Part of my post was to get a feel for what peeps thought.  I realize I was a little off in HELPING without consent.<br>
<br>
======================================<br>
You acted in a manner that would cause most reasonable people to become nervous or uncomfortable. The AC is a very contested mob with a bad history. Kill stealing is expected and feared. You used that against someone to get some kicks.<br>
======================================<br>
First, the mob was not the AC (which I would know well enough to stay away from).  Nowhere in here did I do anything &quot;to get kicks&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
=======================================<br>
I will say this in dead honesty. If you were to do something like this to a creature that I happened to be fighting, you would hear a whole lot worse than &quot;Get off it&quot; from me.<br>
========================================<br>
LOL.  I am not trying to instigate you, but what would I hear from you?   You wouldn't say bad words would you?<br>
<br>
I freely admit that I was partially wrong in the situation.  I just don't understand why people get so bent out of shape so easily over little things.<br>

Oh well, no edit feature strikes again.<br>
<br>
Still, the fact remains that people have a right to engage mobs without other players offering unwelcome help. It's part of the play nice policy for a reason. <br>
<br>
Rather than come here and call him a &quot;noob&quot;, I would think to myself &quot;gee, maybe i should be more careful with my &quot;help&quot; considering that I made someone unhappy&quot;.<br>
<br>
I always hate posting negatively toward someone, because I always end up regretting it. Such is the dangerous attraction of Rants and Raves. <p><img src="http://www.enjoyer.com/barrel.gif" width="270" height="150" border="0">

while to you this may seem like something fairly minor as i recall the undead cyclops drops a piece needed for pally mid level quest armor so he very well could have assumed you were trying to ks him . a little communication goes a long way .<br>
