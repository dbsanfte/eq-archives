I DID petition and Frizznik looked into my logs. NONE of the gear was traded nor sold. ALL of the items were destroyed or just dropped on the floor. So no chance to see to who anything was passed.<br>After talking to him for a bit I saw no reason anymore to get banned or to delete Tamqul, simply because then the asshole would have won. I agreed that it might have been my daughter ( 4 years ) pressing various coloured buttons without knowing what she was doing.<br><br>Frizznik can NOT reimburse or restore items or my level ( destroyed items cannot be restored sacrificed lvls cant either)<br><br>So Norrath here you go: <br>lvl 49 Shammy Looking for skilled XP group :p<br><br>I also want to thank the about 50 ppl that were standing in EC near shady to wave bye bye and then ran off to gather items for me so I can start again. <br>Thank you Corvus for staying with me for over 8 hours at my side, telling tales and laughing. Love you guys.<br><br>**********************************************<br><br>I log on today and get the pop up box  telling me someone tried 9 times to log onto my account.<br>A weird feeling spread out and I kinda knew what I would be going to find.<br>Well I log on find myself in Kael at WL zoneline. ( I logged out in EC where my bind was also )<br>I talk to my guild and they were suprised i was on..simply because was ANON. Everyone that knows me, knows that I almost never even go /role. And NEVER before went anon.<br>I check my inventory just to see that there are only 6 no drop armor parts left (sentry pauldrons, Thurg bracer and boots, sow boots, kromrif military legs,Jarcrap bracer)on me.<br>From 202 wis and unbuffed 878 ac I am down to 116 wis and 650 ac.<br>All my sellable gear GONE.<br>My backpack with my epic items (tear,3 books,reports) GONE.<br>Blue Diamonds for ordered resist gear GONE<br>Cash on char and in bank GONE<br>Almost full set of Velious quest gems (incl. BP, Helm) GONE<br>I didnt look at my XP bar until I zoned to EC from Nro and see a corpse of mine laying there.. <br>Almost 2 yellow bubbs of xp .. GONE <br><br>The items stolen:<br>Arctic wyvern hide cloak, Arctic wyvern mask, Strathbone shell shield, Froggy BP, Paw of Opalla, Medicine totem, 2 imbued ivory earrings, Black alloy medallion, Totemic helm, Coldain Skin gloves, sabretooth amulett, Flayed Turmoilskin belt, 4 BDs, 3 diamonds, almost full set of priest gems for velious quest ( only jaundice gems missing )<br><br>I dont see that this gear was outstanding WHY go for it ? because its just gear of player_013 and noone will care anyway?<br><br>I was just a tad from leaving the game, I was staying because of dear friends and a wonderful guild.<br><br>NOW there is nothing that holds me back from leaving.<br><br>To the person that thinks he/she is a genie, because he/she "hacked" me and stole all my items. GRATZ i hope you get very happy with the few k you get.<br>Thanks for taking a decision from me I would've had to make sooner or later anyway. <br><br>To Lanys: <br>Thank you for giving me a fun year. Thank you for being friends to me and thank you for showing me things I would have not seen without you.<br><br>To Covus Corax:<br>Keep it going, you guys rock and you guys know what to do to make things better. I will miss you all dearly, but I cant step back anymore. Love you all !/hugs<br><br>I will be logging in later on going to Halas where I made my first steps in Norrath ( yes Tam was my first Char ever and I loved her, she was part of me ) /petition and wave bye bye to the world.<br><br><br>Susan<br><br> <p><center><b>Tamqul Gontor</b> <br>Halas Mystic of 54 Winters <br><b>Guildmistress of Corvus Corax</b> <br><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.ravens-nest.de/images/tamqul.jpg" width="446" height="221"></p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utamqulshm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tamqulshm</A> at: 8/30/01 12:19:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uballzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ballzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/29/01 3:04:02 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.austin.rr.com/cproler/face2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Time to leave before I only have bad memories</span><hr size=1> Damnit that sucks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  WTF is wrong with people??

Eventually I couldn't watch it anymore, it was too painful.  I remembered each of those levels you were going through, and how proud you had been to get through them.  Watching you destroy that work was very difficult to take.  I tried to come up with things to make you laugh, or change your mind because I wanted you to suddenly realize that you still enjoyed the game, and that we could replace the gear.<br><br>I am horrified that someone would stoop to something so incredibly petty.  Selling the items would have been bad enough, but taking the epic pieces you had worked hard on was just sickening.
