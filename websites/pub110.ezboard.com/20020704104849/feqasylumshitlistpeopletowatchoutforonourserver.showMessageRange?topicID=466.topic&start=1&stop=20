I wouldn't be posting this if it just happened this once, but I spoke to a lot of people who have had bad experiences with this guy.  Well, we just started a named group in Sol B, and we had just broken the spawn in the first room, so we were mostly oom and medding.  And all of a sudden Orcalen yells for help right in front of us as he drags about 10 kobolds behind him as well as a level 51 ogre warrior who was charmed by the noble.  Well, of course our group can't handle them so we all flee or try to flee.  Except for our pally I think we all made it out, but the ogre also died.  Orcalen surprisingly made it out and I started talking to him.  Basically he said he thought we could take them, which I don't even know why he was training the noble in the first place since we were calling named.<br><br>Second, he said that if he took them to zone people would die... now I fail to see the logic in this.  People at zone are AT the zone so they have little distance to run to save their lives.  Sure, it is annoying when someone calls train and you have to zone.  But I guess it seemed better to him to have our group die instead...  I died once trying to recover the body of my paladin friend.<br><br>I'm not sure why he did this, I personally believe it's because he was trying to gather a group for named when we were moving into it, at least I think that was him.  Otherwise, I have no idea what he was thinking training all of named on us at once.<br><br>I dunno, if people had bad experiences with him also they'd like to post, then I guess this thread is valid.  If this is an isolated case, I'd as the moderators to lock this thread.

To make a long story short, I pulled and we had repops.  Chanter had everything under control... I go LD.  As soon as I go LD, Orcalan sprints to the zoneline rahter than try and handle the mobs.  Without healing, the pally dies and the chanter died right at the zoneline on the way out.  Orcalan never apologizes for this instead saying that he 'KNEW' we couldn't take it out.  Point of fact:  the paladin, chanter, and I had taken out worse pulls before.  Orcalan gets on my ignore list because of his constant badgering about wanting a second chance.<br><br>Lvl 43-45 in Sol B:<br>I start a group in the window room.  We have 5 peeps including two druids in the room when Orcalan asks to be put on list.  I tell the group that I have had trouble with Orcalan in the past but am willing to give him another shot.  One of the groupmembers say that he will leave if Orc is invited.  I tell Orcalan that he will not be put on the list due to a vote taken by the current group members.  He then begs and pleads for 15 minutes about it not being fair.. yada, yada, yada.  I wouldn't tell him who voted for/against him so he starts insulting me in tells.  /ignore Orcalan.  He finally leaves.  30 minutes later I get called up to named.  Who do I find there but Orcalan.  I'm not happy, but I put ignore off and swallow my pride for a little better xp and drops.  He sends me a tell then saying &quot;... not so quiet now are you?&quot;  I don't bother to respond and just hope that he chooses to heal me when the time comes.  He does a decent job healing though he gets on our chanters and groupmates nerves constantly telling him who/when/what to mezz/clarity.  First drop we get... a shield of slain unicorn (POS warrior only shield).  Group leader sees there are no warriors there... says we'll roll on it.  Orcalan says that he NEEDS it because he promised it to a friend of his.  /boggle Why promise something you don't have?  We roll, he doesn't get... he whines and whines and whines.  Next drop... forgot what it was... but exact same thing.  An item he can't possibly use that he 'promised' to a friend and has to have.  /g sorry guys... guild group starting... have to go.  /disband.  I left Sol B, got a port to DL, and went to the North Wall.<br><br>I really think it's a maturity issue more than outright hate and deceit.  However, that is one of those things that I avoid at all costs now.  I don't have time to babysit people during my time in Norrath.  I don't have time for people that think everything that drops should be theirs for distribution to their friends.  IMO, if you let your group down when they need you to pull your weight, you're not going to be invited back.  If you're lucky enough to get a second chance, you best put on your Sunday best and make a superb impression to overwrite the bad one you made the first time around.<br><br>Orcalan, loot is nothing but pixels in this game bud.  You'll get to lvl 50 eventually, but the ends NEVER justify the means.  One day you'll learn that... hopefully.<br><br>Otter Antilles<br>Cavalier of The Shadow Order <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukiam1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiam1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/2/01 10:15:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=466.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Orcalen</span><hr size=1> Thank you for your post Annastazia... I do agree, I believe that train was completely intentional.  I took named from him when he didn't have a group for it so he retaliates.  Just about every other thing he's said on his posts have been false, including him apologizing or us getting a erudite heart or whatever, we didn't get anything because we didn't have to to fight anything before we all died or came very near dying.  I do not consider this a bad accidental train, I consider it very deliberate and that's why he will always be on my personal shitlist even if he gets taken off here.

Ive seen his waste all his mana on nukes, claim drops he promised to other people, leave on short notice, volunteer to leave the group in the middle of a fight to go and rez at zone line, whine, shout, pout and basically everything else that was metioned here.  Ive seen him insult our cleric, for waiting too long to heal someone after we refused to put him on the list in named and got a huge train (we all lived though).  Ive seen him, start a window group and take them there without checking to see if there was one and try to take the room with the first group still there.  <br><br>I try to give people more that 1 chance, and so gave a few groups a try in Solb with him in it but now due to those experiences I will not group with him, I dont feel I can trust him to heal me in time due to my experiences and my friends experiences with him.  And as a chanter with super low hps, without a good healer you will die and quick.  I also wont raid with him and have left raids due to him being put as the cleric in the group with no backup healers.<br><br>Personally Ive been waiting a long time to see his name up here was starting to think he might have grown up a bit,  (he does act a lot like a spoiled child, esp when trying to get a port, ported into the LS druid rings as my druid real quick once and got asked about 5 times for a port to commons) but I guess not.  I know there were other instances as well, but cant recall them as I have tried to put them behind me.  But seeing the posts up here I felt like I should tell my experiences too.<br><br>Aniiena Bacchae<br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A
