So, I will bear the brunt of warning everyone about her. Incident involves hate raid and ninja looting. I have a feeling she's not up here because not many people actually know about the incident. The only reason I know about it is because a friend of mine was in her group. I apologize if a lot of this seems to be hearsay. I'll try to keep it as short and sweet as possible without leaving out any pertinent details.<br><br>There was a hate raid on April 19, which I attended as a spur of the moment thing. There were a total of four clerics on this raid. Mishakaal came into SRo as we were porting up and asked to go - something that I was leery about from hearing all the horror stories of what a terrible cleric she was in-group. There were tons of cleric drops that night, despite the fact we probably barely even killed 30 mobs. After our first round of kills, I believe pants were rolled to clerics, won by the dwarf whose name eludes me. After some other class stuff was rolled out, there were a few shouts of &quot;what happened to the arms?&quot; At the time I did not know what arms they were talking about, so dismissed it as someone being mistaken and thinking something dropped that did not. Cleric gloves soon dropped thereafter, which Mishakaal was defaulted since two clerics had gloves, the other cleric just won boots, and she was the only cleric left. Cleric helm dropped which my sister won. Clearmyst (cleric in my group) was the only cleric left not to win anything, and all he had left to complete his set was the bp and helm.<br><br>After we moved to D, a cleric BP did drop, obviously being defaulted to Clear since he had not one anything. He went to loot the bp, but died and went LD (/comfort Clear). A huge battle ensued at this point. We had 2 clerics (Clear and the one who won the pants) out of 4 down, and my sister was desperately trying to camp out. The whole raid is dying. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> During</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> all of this, Mishakaal <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> loots</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the breastplate (unbeknownst to most of the raiders), and instead of camping out, she <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> gates</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from the plane.<br><br>While waiting for clerics to get ported back to the plane (my sister was unable to camp), I was speaking with one of my friends who happened to be in her group. This is when I found out that not only did she just loot that BP which should have been Clearmyst's (despite the fact that he went LD, all of the clerics were bp-less, so it should have been re-rolled if anything), but the mysterious arms people were shouting about were in fact looted by Mishakaal.<br><br>Now apparently she had given her group members the impression that she didn't know that you weren't supposed to loot just because your group got the exp. At about the time the arms dropped, she told the rogue in their group that there was something for him on another mob. At this point her group members explained to her how loot worked on a hate raid. I can give someone the benefit of the doubt the first time. However, the fact that she still looted that bp, the fact that she gated out of hate rather than trying to camp, and the fact that she did not put on her newly acquired armor pieces at the time (she is wearing at least the bp now) lead me to believe that it was an intentional act, and she should be avoided if you value your playing time/experience. <br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Moderators, if you feel this goes way beyond hearsay, feel free to delete this next comment...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>I've heard through the grapevine that another cleric (who was not on the raid) had confronted her about the looting/gating. As to the gating, she responded to the effect of, &quot;I wasn't going to die for those people.&quot; <br><br>To the members of Magick's Gambit, I strongly suggest you look at what you feel are the benefits of having Mishakaal in your guild, for a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. As it stands, she did not have the best reputation as someone to group with, and now has an even worse one as a ninja looter with a total disregard for the welfare of her fellow raiders.<br> <p><center><img src=http://members.fortunecity.com/lanyslirana/hawaiilirana.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ugaruf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garuf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/22/02 7:14:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=825.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mishakaal</span><hr size=1> I will mention my experience with Mishakaal:<br><br>I have petitioned Mishakaal once for harassing me and my groupmembers. <br><br>After several warnings from our groupleader, she got disbanded, lets say she did not accept this.

He asked me if I wanted to come pull/tank.  Well, instead of telling the whole story, I pulled the entire island of spec's on accident, and both Mishakaal and I ended up dying.  Not once did she give any hint of trying to gate out, and was in fact trying to heal me the whole time.  <br><br>I offered to wait at corpse, even though I hadn't told her that I planned to log soon anyways cause how late it was.  She had forgotten to bind herself close, and was in Kunark, I believe.  Well, she was nice, didn't mind that I got her killed, and told me that I didn't need to wait.  All in all, I never had any problems with her.

All she talks about after she joins in how much she NEEDS to loot all the money off the mobs because she had lost all of her equipment due to her body rooted or somethign.  We felt bad she had lost of af her equipment, so we let her loot the money, even a forest loop that dropped.  She explained this story over and over again about losing her equipment and how a GM helped her, and how she ONLY had a 210 wisdom.  &quot;i lost my stuff, gm won't help, i had uber gear, i need help, can i loot that? pls help me, i only have 210 wis, can you belive they wouldn't help, i lost all my stuff and the gm won't give it all back&quot;   i mean, enough is enough.

No guild deserves to have someone with this much disrespect to their fellow players carrying the guild tag above their head. <br><br>Tinile, I had suggested to my friend that he scroll up to the breastplate loot message and do a /report. However, he had died right before she did it and was zoning as she looted the bp. I told him to ask his other group members to /report her, though I am not sure if he did or not. The leader of the raid was a bard named Keein. Whether or not he reported it to a GM (he was pretty upset over it), I do not know. I will see if I can find Keein in-game later tonight to find out.<br><br>Mira, this raid wasn't the best lead raid in the world. However, everyone has to start somewhere. Despite that fact, it's to no fault of the raid leader/leaders when someone takes loot that they were told was not theirs. I'm almost positive that the sleeves were not rolled on. However, the repercussions of Misha's actions are this: Calara (my sister) would have been defaulted the sleeves since the dwarf cleric won pants, Misha won gloves, and Clearmyst already had them. When the helm dropped, Clearmyst would have been defaulted the helm since he was the only cleric left not to win anything and it was one of only two armor pieces remaining for him. When the bp dropped, depending on how the raid leader would have handled the situation, it would have been rolled to all four clerics or defaulted to Clearmyst (there was a 1-piece roll in effect, though most leaders will not allow defaults unless you were 1 piece away when raid started). <p><center><img src=http://members.fortunecity.com/lanyslirana/hawaiilirana.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uterentiavarro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terentia Varro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/22/02 11:27:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=825.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mishakaal</span><hr size=1> Ghosteel I remember a similar incident in Oasis long time ago.
