With a friend &quot;Orji&quot;, a halfling ranger, 26th. <br><br>They were to tough even both of us heavily twinked our levels. So we moved down to the Bogling area not to far from the mutant tunnel entrance. <br><br>We begin to pull the Boglings *4spawns*, but quickly run out since they are much lower than the mutants, my friend goes on ahead and pulls while I meditate/lich. <br><br>She pulls from the mosquito area (on the way to Fungus Grove, roughly 8-10 spawn points), and immediately Poik, a male iksar necromancer (27+), begins to pull the mobs that my friend does, telling her to &quot;fuck off&quot;, get lost, its his camp ect in /ooc. <br><br>(My friend DID NOT call camp check, and didn't see Poik. I believe we were the only ones in zone, so we didn't think of anyone camping the area, it is very dark, and Poik wearing a FBR blends in well with the walls in the mosquito cavern.)<br><br>Which would have been fine with me and my friend, except for Poik being horribly rude, and immature for nothing. I brushed it off and thought nothing of it after that for awhile while we are pulling some more Boglings.<br><br>Few minutes goes by, they may have exchanged tells though I doubt it. (and I don't feel like logging back into find out just for this) Poik dies in our &quot;camp&quot;, and we are out of Boglings, 5 minutes or so passes with no sign of Poik, so we move down to mosquito area since they are more level appropriate, and numerous.<br><br>Soon after moving in Poik shows up, (he had a pet, I don't know if he had it out already, or summoned it while there), I ignore him and my friend goes ahead and pulls, he begins to chain-cast &quot;Shock of Poison&quot;, out damaging us on 5 or so kills, stealing the experience, and loot from us.<br><br>After a few more various random, pointless rude comments in /say from Poik, I report him, and petition. GM ignores me for awhile then I send them a direct tell, getting a rather quick response.<br><br>The GM talked to Poik, telling him to leave and to not KS, but apparently will do nothing disiplinary to him. (Why? I don't know, certainly if I had KS'd 5 mobs from someone in a row I'd been banned, had my testicles baked in a toaster oven, and locked in solitary confinement -- forced to listen to &quot;Music from the 80's&quot; looped infinitely)<br><br>It was obviously our camp, which he was KS'n our pulls from. If he had of asked, me and Orji would have happily shared the spawn no problems, he choose to KS, which is why I shitlisted him. <br><br>We finally died out (over-zealous ranger pullers are bad, mmkay?) Then left the camp, since by the rules of whatever it was his camp. To bad he hadn't saw that when he was ks'n us, hmm? And I'll be damned before I'll cry PNP, on anyone for any reason.<br><br>I found it to be SL material, since he was rude, hateful for nothing, and intentionally Killstealing mobs from us.<br><br>(not to mention one of the ones who can't type a complete sentance without some sort of &quot;l33t&quot; slang, which deserves another Shitlist in itself)<br><br>Before his/her/its little friends pops up on the board to defend him...<br>/flip STFU    I know what happened, you weren't there, get bent.<br><br><br>If this gets moved to R&amp;R or locked thats fine, I don't mind, but it seemed like a worthy Shitlist, at least people will hopefully see it and know to avoid him.<br><br>This was posted from a strictly unbiased viewpoint. I honestly don't care one way or another, but this person struck me as one of the bad ones, very dishonorable, ignorant, and pigheaded.<br><br>/shrug<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubiten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Biten</A> at: 5/10/02 3:54:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/utrottothewarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TrottoTheWarrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/10/02 5:52:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=844.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SL cherry break:Poik</span><hr size=1> people like that have friends?<br><br>Shitty thing to happen to ya, and to think the plague of stupidity is moving to Luclin.... /shiver.  <p><center><img src="http://cif.rochester.edu/~xraptorx/Tsig.gif"><BR>52 Halfling Champion</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/urylex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rylex</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/10/02 6:53:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=844.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.asianmanrecords.com/basket/images/buttons/keepyourcountry.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SL cherry break:Poik</span><hr size=1> wasn't poik on the shitlist before for something? <p><EMBED src="http://www.knutsacextreme.com/flash/Movie3.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#000000  WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=240 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED><center><i>Now all the time I was watching this, I was beginning to get very aware of like not feeling all that well.
