      For me, it's not really an issue; as far as I can understand, the &quot;under god&quot; bit was a McCarthy era add on stuck in on the theory that communists would thus be unable to take various oaths and affirmations, thus revealing themselves. I have a huge grudge against anything &quot;tailgunner joe&quot; was involved in in any way, and I'm not rational about it. I have a smoldering hatred of the man... ah well. <br>
      I do remember growing up, one authentic incident where I thought forcing people to recite the pledge was wrong. In 7th grade, one of my classmates, a swiss citizen who's parents were living in the US for business reasons, was made to get up in front of the class and lead us in the pledge. She'd moved here about two months before, and she didn't know the first word of it. Our homeroom teacher pretty much humiliated her, and sent her to the principal's office in tears. The principal was very understanding, and just sent her back, but that night her parents really bitched her out, and basically told her, stop sticking out, learn the goddamned pledge and don't get in any more trouble. Granted, she's still one of my best friends 12 or 14 years later, and I'm biased because of it, but I'm pretty ashamed that any american would bully a 12 year old girl like that under those circumstances. I think things like that are what my grandfathers and great grandfathers fought and died to prevent; it's just intolerant horseshit.<br>
   But anyway... to sum up my little rambling digression... I don't think the McCarthy era senate had any more business fooking around with the pledge of alligance than I have revising Madison's notes on the costitutional convention. While we may not have a wholehearted, rational belief in these little bits of ceremoy, they serve as a sort of historical/artistic relic that can bring people together and make us feel that wierd kind of resonace about where our nation came from and what it stands for, and we should recognize that. Messing with it is like sticking fig leaves on the figures on the cistine chapel ceiling; future conservationists will have to undo it, and we will only look petty. When I was a little girl, what we now recognize as &quot;political correctness&quot; was something my great grandfather was pissed off about. When he joined the United States Navy in 1917, they were required to learn &quot;the national air&quot;; the anthem as we know it plus stanzas 2 and 4. 3 had been omitted because the British were our allies in WWI, and all that about them paying in blood for stepping on our soil just wouldn't do at all. <br>

<br>
The other day I spent far too long on these message boards and let myself get carried away.<br>
<br>
As you may have noticed I have a serious (resentment? hatred? loathing?  I dunno) for Organized Religion.  I want everyone to know that I don't have a single problem with faiths, religions, beliefs etc.  My anger is directed at the authoritative structures that lead the religions.  My reasons are too numerous to list here and I'm sure none of you want to hear them anyway.  I went too far and dragged those problems into this discussion and for that, again, I am sorry.<br>
<br>
I still do believe the Pledge of Allegiance should be returned to it's original format without the inclusion of God.  We've already covered the other religions being excluded, which I still stand firm with.  And the Non-Believers too, in my opinion, are also excluded.  The Pledge of Allegiance is officially recognized by the government and with the phrase 'Under God', which was never originally intended to be there,  it is something that not every one of our fellow Americans can fully believe in.  Some people don't understand this and, admittedly, it is difficult to explain.  God is something that not everyone can believe in and an Athiest (or Buddhist, etc.) shouldn't have to mention God when Pledging to the Flag of the United States of America.  Yes, they could omit the 'Under God' portion, but then it wouldn't be the Pledge as it is recognized by our Government.  It may be a very small point but, as we are starting to see, it doesn't have to be big to have deep meaning to people.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to mention (blame Carson Daily) that I am also in favor of removing 'In God We Trust' from our currency, but as this would be such an irritating, time consuming, fund-wasting project it's not very high on my priority list.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I mean does anyone really read their money?  I spend mine as fast as I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm trying to become rational again on this subject and I hope I succeeded.<br>
