<br>
Greetings all! I am holding an open raid on Lord Nagafen on wednesday April 24th after the patch.  If this vile creature fails to show, the raid will be rescheduled for the following day, April 25th.  The raid will start at 5pm PST (both days) - Let's vanquish this foe - Huzzah!<br>
<br>
I've posted this guide (Credit to Brewall Rainsinger // Cazic-Thule) to explain how a<br>
textbook Naggy raid is accomplished.  For many players, dragon hunts are their first foray<br>
into large scale raids and if you have never done one before, this guide will explain a lot<br>
of what is going on, and what you need to do.  First of all, most leaders of dragon raids<br>
will tell you that if your sole desire for attending is to gain exp and loot, these raids are<br>
NOT for you, so please do not attend.  Another note to fellows new to drgaon raids...be<br>
patient. Pulling off a large open raid can take a bit of time, especially if the raid is short of<br>
certain classes.  Enjoy the guide, and hope to see you all there!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
WHAT YOU NEED TO ATTEND<br>
<br>
1. You should be between levels 46 and 52, although clerics of lower levels are<br>
sometimes used when there is a shortage.  (When have you ever seen too many clerics on<br>
a raid?)  Sometimes raid leaders include participants lower than 46, but in my experience<br>
this may do more harm than good, as Nagafen’s level (55) makes these people not as<br>
effective.  If space allows, lower level characters may be included, but this is only at the<br>
discretion of the Raid Leader and is unlikely if an abundance of the needed class are<br>
available.<br>
<br>
2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Fire Resistance of 100. The higher the<br>
better.  This is extremely important!<br>
<br>
3. Bring two peridots: one for cleric and one for enchanter. These will be used for some<br>
important buff spells. (Symbol and Rune)  Please do not impose upon these folks for<br>
expensive spell components - it’s only polite that you reimburse them for the cost of<br>
buffing you.  (After all, without them we could not raid very successfully!)  Each peridot<br>
costs about 11pp and can be found most places gems are sold.  It’s a small one to pay to<br>
get these needed buffs, and believe me, your healer and chanter will appreciate you for it!<br>
<br>
4. Loot rules are listed below.<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW TO GET THERE<br>
<br>
1. Closest Druid portal: NW corner of Lavastorm<br>
<br>
2. Closest Wizard portal: SE corner of Nekulos Forest<br>
<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER<br>
<br>
1. Naggy is a level 55 Dragon Warrior.<br>
<br>
2. Naggy's most deadly weapon is his AE fire breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much<br>
MR/FR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC!) to get these as high<br>
as possible.<br>
<br>
3. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 2xEarring of Fire<br>
Reflection (AC1 FR5 ~26pp at Lavastorm gypsies), Gold Diamond Mask (FR10 CR10<br>
MR3), Gold Hermatite Necklace (FR7), Gold Emerald Bracelet (AC4 FR6), Platinum<br>
Emerald Ring (AC4 FR10), Hand Woven Legging (AC8 FR10), Rune Boned Fork<br>
(MR10 CR10 FR10), and Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20).<br>
<br>
4. Many of the mobs in Solusek have high fire resist - including Naggy, so use cold based<br>
spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
<br>
5. In order to cast any spell on any dragon - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HIS MELEE<br>
RANGE.  If not, the spell will be *automatically* resisted.<br>
<br>
<br>
STAGING PHASE<br>
<br>
1. When you are in Lavastorm, report in to the Raid Leader by sending ONE tell with<br>
your class and level.  You will be considered registered unless otherwise told by the Raid<br>
Leader.  We will be gathering at the druid rings, which is in the NW quadrant of<br>
Lavastorm.   PLEASE arrive on time.  People arriving late is the primary cause of long<br>
delays prior to a raid.<br>
<br>
2. The Raid Leader may announce if the raid is short of certain classes. Please check with<br>
friends if asked.  The quicker the holes are filled, the sooner we can begin.<br>
<br>
3. Please turn off anonymous/role-play and turn on LFG when you show up in Lavastorm.<br>
<br>
4.  Join the Nagafen raid channel by typing /join naggy.<br>
<br>
5. The Raid Leader, puller, and Main Assist (MA)/ Secondary Assist (SA) will use the<br>
shout channel. All other communication/questions should be on the Naggy chat channel. <br>
Please DO NOT send a tell to the Raid Leader asking questions...ask them in Naggy chat,<br>
and the people helping with the raid will be glad to answer them for you.  The Raid<br>
Leader is extremely busy with coordinating the event, and the raid may be significantly<br>
delayed if he/she has to personally answer lots of tells.  Any raider banter for the purpose<br>
of amusement and chatter should be confined to the OOC channel. (and this is, of course,<br>
encouraged - we are here to have fun, after all!)<br>
<br>
6. It may take a little while for the Raid Leader to work out final groups, especially if<br>
people are still arriving and if the raid is short of people in critical areas (clerics,<br>
enchanters, bards, nukers).  If you’re a porter, please offer over Naggy chat to pick folks<br>
up..this will hasten the start of the raid and will be much appreciated by the people<br>
attending - especially the host!<br>
<br>
7. The Main (MA) and Secondary Assists (SA) will be named over shout by the Raid<br>
Leader. Create a hotkey for each.<br>
<br>
8. Form into final groups once they are announced by the Raid Leader. Write down ALL<br>
members on paper for future reference (with so many people, it may be difficult to target<br>
someone with a mouse, so just use the &quot;/target [name]&quot; command).  It is important that<br>
everyone write down the group members’ names, in case the Group Leader goes LD or<br>
the group is disbanded, it can be reassembled quickly and easily.<br>
<br>
9. Once groups are formed, group leaders will move their groups into Sol B (as directed<br>
by the Raid Leader) and we will work ourselves to the Lava, at which point everyone will<br>
need Levitation to cross to the Fire Giant castle.<br>
<br>
<br>
KILLING GIANTS PHASE<br>
<br>
1. Unless you are being directed to pull, stay back.  The puller will use shout *only* to<br>
inform the MA of incoming mobs.  DO NOT attack until the Main Assist calls it!  This is<br>
a critical detail that causes many an unncessary death on dragon raids.  Also, medding<br>
while Fire Giants are at the camp will cause them to agro you!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2. Please follow instructions given in shout by the Raid Leader or the Main Assist.  Some<br>
may not always agree with the plan, but by attending a raid you are, in a sense, conceding<br>
that you will go with the plan that is being implemented - good, bad, or otherwise. <br>
Seldom is a raid successful where there a half a dozen “armchair” generals offering<br>
unsolicited advice over the channel and openly criticizing the raid rules/plan.<br>
<br>
3. The pullers will begin pulling the giants to the groups. This phase is often tricky and<br>
the puller may die if not correctly. All these mobs are on an approximate 8 hour timer. <br>
Once the Throne Room is clear, the Raid Leader will announce so and instruct the groups<br>
to move to the Throne Room.  [Throne Room Golden Rule:  Stay away from the Throne!] <br>
Once more giants are cleared, the raid will cross a molten lake using a drawbridge which<br>
is on a timer.  [Drawbridge Golden Rule:  Do not play with the drawbridge mechanism -<br>
it will dump the raid party into the lake, where there is no easy way to exit. (Yes, we all<br>
die.)]  When the last giant is killed, the groups will move to the safe spot in the hallway<br>
near Nagafen's chambers (a.k.a “buff room”). Once this phase starts, please do not go<br>
AFK.<br>
<br>
4. Nuking casters will bind in this room so that in death, can memorize critical spells and<br>
jump back into the fight. In the past, players sometimes left a couple coins on the ground<br>
to prevent empty corpses from vanishing if dying again. An alternate approach was to<br>
have everyone in group create a &quot;/split 0 0 0 6&quot; key, which can be used prior to someone<br>
coming back into the fight.  Hopefully, this is an unnecessary precaution!<br>
<br>
<br>
6.  There are conflicting opinions on this, but to be on the safe side, bards should not sing<br>
in the buff hall, as it may cause Nagafen to agro.  Yuck!<br>
<br>
7. The Raid Leader will go through the entire attack plan and buffing information at this<br>
point.<br>
<br>
<br>
BUFFING PHASE<br>
<br>
1. Go to your graphic and filter options and turn everything off or to minimum (spell<br>
effects, level of detail, damage shield messages, etc), otherwise you will be spammed by<br>
spell effects and miss instructions given over chat or shout.<br>
<br>
2. When the Raid Leader indicates, everyone should cancel all of their buffs.  The first<br>
four buffs are ALWAYS “fake” buffs.  Nagafen will dispel with first 4 buffs during the<br>
early part of combat, so these buffs are set up as a decoy for the AE dispell.<br>
<br>
3. The buffs should be done in the following order:<br>
  #01 caster - fake buff (e.g. resist cold)<br>
  #02 caster - fake buff (e.g. resist poison)<br>
  #03 caster - fake buff (e.g. resist disease)<br>
  #04 caster - fake buff (e.g. ultravision, see invisible)<br>
  #05 shaman - talisman of altuna - HP238 (250mana - 72min)<br>
  #06 shaman - stamina - STA37 (~100HP) (100 - 63min)<br>
  #07 cleric - shield of words - AC32 (300 - 72min)<br>
  #08 cleric - heroism - AC20 HP400 (140mana - 72min)<br>
  #09 cleric - symbol of naltron - HP525 Peridot (315mana - 54min)<br>
  #10 enchanter - rune IV / V - DMG620/700 Peridot (350mana - 110min)<br>
  #11 enchanter - group resist magic - MR55 (200mana - 36min)<br>
  #12 enchanter - haste / clarity - (185mana - 16min/75mana - 27min)<br>
  #13 druid - circle of winter - group FR45 (150mana - 36min)<br>
  #14 druid - chloro (200mana - 15min)<br>
  #15 open - for bard resist song<br>
<br>
4. Any buff needs that a group has will be addressed by the GROUP LEADER.  He/she<br>
should send a tell to a person of appropriate class on the raid and ask them for that buff,<br>
mana permitting.  Please do not send a tell to the Raid Leader asking for these buffs.<br>
(unless, of course, they are capable of casting it!)  Sometimes, a raid will be short/devoid<br>
of a certain buffing class, at which point substitute buffs are improvised for in their slots.<br>
<br>
5. Once everyone has been buffed, casters (which should have bound in the buff room<br>
already) will med up for the attack, and the Group Leader will announce over shout that<br>
his/her group is fully buffed and ready.<br>
<br>
6. Now is the time to make sure your raid resist gear is equipped (yes, we’ve all forgotten<br>
this at one time or another) and switch on WALK. Nagafen will cast fear, and it is best to<br>
be on walk mode. If you have run mode on and he fears you, you may wind up in lava!<br>
<br>
7. Any class that has a pet should summon one at this point.<br>
<br>
8.  Once the Group Leaders have confirmed that their group is buffed and FM, the assault<br>
will take place.<br>
<br>
<br>
ASSAULTING NAGAFEN<br>
<br>
1. Only the Raid Leader and/or MA will shout attack instructions. Smooth raids are ones<br>
where everyone knows what to do and follows instructions.<br>
<br>
2.  DO NOT attack until assist is called.  Many a raid has wiped as Nagafen rushed past<br>
the MA into the buff hall when someone attacked too early.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3.  Bards should start to play Elemental Rhythms with a drum (which should add<br>
approximately 71MR, 71CR, and 71FR).<br>
<br>
4.  The main tank groups will rush Naggy when instructed, activate disciplines (if you<br>
have them), and attack. Bards will not attack with hand-to-hand (insignificant melee<br>
damage and Nagafen ripostes can cause significant damage). The safest place for a bard<br>
to fight will be directly below stomach near his hind legs. If lag is minimal and it is<br>
possible, twist Guardian Rhythms ( 71MR and 10AC), or other buffs.<br>
<br>
5. Goal is to keep Nag at the doorway between the porticullis and the bridge in his lair.  If<br>
he flees into his chamber, DO NOT follow him.<br>
<br>
6.  If a lot of melees are present and you have 4-5 groups, two more groups can be sent in<br>
once Nagafen has been engaged.<br>
<br>
7. Some melees should positon themselves behind Nagafen to a) keep him from being<br>
pushed back across his bridge, and b) to avoid Nagafen’s AE directional breath weapon.<br>
<br>
8.  Casters will remain in the hallway at the base of the stairs.<br>
<br>
<br>
EARLY INTO FIGHT<br>
<br>
9. Once assist is called, Shamans should immediately begin to attempt to slow/debuf Nag<br>
and should OOC successes (&quot;Slowed&quot;, &quot;Malosied&quot;, etc).  Bards may consider adding a<br>
debuf to twist (1 does cold resist, 1 does magic resist).<br>
<br>
10. Necros should avoid spells that turn Naggy into a skeleton. This makes it very<br>
difficult to find the mob with so many people.<br>
<br>
11. Healers should remain back in the hallway until needed. If there is only a single<br>
person in the group taking damage, they should move back to healers and get a heal. This<br>
allows the healers to stay out of breath range. If a number of people have taken damage,<br>
the healer should come to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is in the<br>
hallway outside breath range.<br>
<br>
12. Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their group. Bard<br>
resistances are preventing an enormous amount of AE fire damage, and bards have the<br>
fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that will not come back to the<br>
bridge for healing if they are the only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive,<br>
keep them alive.<br>
<br>
13. Healers should only use “fast heals” (i.e. not CH), as they take too long to cast and are<br>
guaranteed to get you summoned to the Dragon on the first try.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
14. Necros should pump mana to clerics.<br>
<br>
<br>
AT 70% HEALTH:<br>
<br>
15. Pets are called in to attack.<br>
<br>
16. 1 enchanter should Tash and should OOC &quot;Tashed&quot; if successful. If Nagafen agros<br>
and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should NOT be healed (hate will be transferred to<br>
healer and healer will die). Heal the enchanter if they live.<br>
<br>
17. Enchanters will have hard time landing any damage spell on Nagafen.<br>
<br>
<br>
AT 50% HEALTH<br>
<br>
18. Nukes and casters will be called in. Remember to get within melee range or your spell<br>
will not land. Nuke until Nag is dead!<br>
<br>
19. If a caster dies, memorize critical spells and rejoin the fight.  In fact, a clever caster<br>
will have their spell books already opened to the nuke page, so if they do go down, it<br>
saves precious time in memming. All rezzes will be done when Naggy goes down.<br>
<br>
20. If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can move away from Nagafen and<br>
suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (dragon targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
NAG DEATH<br>
<br>
1. Nag's corpse should not decay for 30 minutes until after he dies.<br>
<br>
2. The Group Leader of the killing group should tell the Raid Leader that their group got<br>
the EXP.  Under no circumstances should anyone from the EXP group loot or inspect the<br>
corpse. Some raids will have a trusted member lock the corpse until the Raid Leader can<br>
get to the corpse.<br>
<br>
3. No one else should inspect the body. Everyone but the Raid Leader should back away<br>
from the corpse.<br>
<br>
4. All resurrections will be performed at this time. Temporary groups may be assigned<br>
with clerics &amp; bards to minimize time.   Loot should not be rolled until EVERYONE has<br>
been rezzed.<br>
<br>

something you intend to sell if other people need it.  This usually comes back to haunt<br>
you at some later date.<br>
<br>
***DISCLAIMER:  Since there is never any way to predict what Lord Nagafen will drop<br>
when slain, the Raid Leader MAY chose an item that is dropped and GREED roll it<br>
among the raid.  Basically, I will only do this if there is nothing that dropped that a<br>
particular class can roll on.  The goal here is to give everyone at least ONE chance to win<br>
something from the raid.***<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTES REGARDING HIGH LEVEL (53+) CHARACTERS ASSISTING ON RAID:<br>
<br>
It is possible for a level 53+ player to directly assist in a Nag fight, but it is moderated by<br>
getting expelled by Nag (other than buffs prior to a fight). If you get placed on his hate<br>
list, you will be expelled.<br>
<br>
1. Casting a spell on Naggy will cause you to get expelled. The spell may or may not<br>
land. Spells that cause waves of damage appear to work - subsequent to the first wave.<br>
<br>
2. Healing people fighting Nag will result in an expulsion. The heal will generally take,<br>
lower level heals (non-CH) will sometimes allow you to cast more than one prior to<br>
expulsion.<br>
<br>
3. Getting too close to Nag may result in an expulsion.  The agro radius is quite large.<br>

4. Some groups have used CoH (Call of Hero) to heal people. Since CoH wipes a persons<br>
hate list, someone can be summoned, have CH cast on them, and return to the fight. Since<br>
the hate list was cleared with the CoH, the healer is not placed on hate list.<br>
<br>
5. Some raids have used 53+ characters to keep any adds from bothering the raid group.<br>
