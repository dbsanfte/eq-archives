 It had been nearly a year since the Ogre had entered the Plane of Hatred with his fellow adventurers and spent nearly a month in the plane gaining power, fortune, and battle experience. Spending every waking moment honing, and perfecting his techniques, the Ogre began to seek out new adventures. He heard about a frozen wasteland with monsters of immense power that would most certainly give him a great challenge. He once again gathered his friends together and set out for this new land.<br>
<br>
They spent nearly a day traveling on the boat just to get to the edge of this desolate wasteland. The captain of the barge refused to journey any further into the lands, for the sake his ship's safety. Setting out on foot, the adventurers saw nothing but endless ice and frozen islands. Exploration was kept somewhat to a minimum, for their past experiences had taught them that the greatest challenges lay the deepest in the land.<br>
<br>
After 2 days of venturing through the frozen lands, they came upon a city inhabited by giants. The giants seemed weary of the adventurers, having never seen them, they did not know wether to attack them or let them go on their way. After talking to the guards at the front gate, they were directed to the deeper part of the city. As they continued to speak with the guards of the city they found their way to the king. <br>
<br>
&quot;We seek adventure and honor, and are wondering if you would be able to help us find a way in which we could accomplish this.&quot; The Ogre said as he knelt to King Tormax.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have not heard much of you, however if adventure and honor is what you seek, there is a temple inhabited by dragons. The risk of entering is great, but there is nothing better than fighting dragons to prove yourself. You may find this temple by venturing to the deepest part of this land. The journey itself is a dangerous one, as there are dragons that wander aimlessly around the area near the temple's entrance. If you cannot handle the journey there, you are not worthy to fight in the temple itself.&quot; King Tormax said, as his voice bellowed through the air. &quot;However, should you defeat the dragons in the temple, and bring me proof of your feat, I shall reward you with armor of great power.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, they restocked their food and water supplies, and set off to the temple dedicated to the dragon god Veeshan. As they journeyed out, they were in awe as they saw just how unforgiving the land was. <br>
<br>
Almost a week went by before the adventurers made it to the area that the entrance to the temple was in. As they came into the wastelands, they found what King Tormax said to be true. Dragons, and their kin were wandering all throughout the lands. The dragons they encountered on their way to the Temple seemed weak in comparison to them, and fell swiftly before their might. They searched for hours on end before they came across a gorge with a enormous doorway in the wall. After resting for a brief moment, they entered through the door and were overwhelmed the smell of magic. <br>
<br>
They ventured slowly into the temple, unsure of what to expect. They knew not of the perils that lay ahead of them. The monsters they fought near the entrance of the temple gave them a false sense of confidence that would soon be shaken as they would engage one of many dragons. <br>
<br>
The first dragon they encountered was blood red, and was incredibly stronger than any they had ever seen. The battle lasted for 5 hours, as the dragon inflicted pain beyond what any of the adventurers had thought possible. Upon defeating the dragon, a talisman appeared on the ground where the dragon fell.<br>
<br>
Dragon after dragon, the adventurers moved throughout the temple. Each one stronger than the next. The strength of the dragons grew in leaps as they got deeper. After much consideration, the adventurers determined that the next dragon may prove to be far beyond what they could handle. With that decision they headed back to the giant city to show the proof of their accomplishments to King Tormax.<br>
<br>
Approaching King Tormax, the Ogre held out several talisman's as proof of what his friends and he had accomplished. Astonished, King Tormax congratulated the adventurers on and had his armorers make them armor worthy of their abilities. The adventurers were amazed at the incredible craftsmanship of the armor. It was far better than any armor they had ever seen before and they wore it with pride.<br>
<br>
Before the adventurers left the city, King Tormax said to them, &quot;Should you choose to continue aiding us in our war against the dragons, I will continue to provide you with armor and weapons to aid you in battle.&quot;<br>
<br>
With their new armor, they went back to the dragon temple to prove themselves more. As they got to the entrance, they expected it to be empty up to the point which they had fought up to before. To their surprise, all of the dragons they had fought previously were waiting for them. They went after the dragons with new found confidence, and found them to be incredibly easier than the first time. Venturing back into the temple, the adventurers fought their way through much quicker, and got to the point they stopped at in less than half the time. <br>
<br>
With the difficulty they thought the upcoming dragons to be at, they began to discuss possible strategies for slaying them...several strategies were devised for varying situations, and with that, they went after the next dragon. It was dark black, with red eyes, and a blue underside. It's wingspan went nearly from one side of the room to the next, and it's power could be sensed throughout the halls surrounding the room. <br>
<br>
The battle lasted for 8 hours that seemed to be an eternity. The dragon punished them without mercy, inflicting pain in every way conceivable. However their perseverance paid off. As it fell to the ground, a talisman appeared on the ground, as well as a chest that contained several weapons and pieces of armor. The armor shimmered with power, and made the armor that was crafted for them by the armorers of the king seem flawed in comparison.<br>
<br>
They talked amongst one another to determine who the armor would be best suited for, and after the items were handed out, they continued on their way through the temple. The dragons continued to get harder, but as they got new items of power from each dragon, the fights weren't anywhere near as hard as they should have been. After nearly 10 dragons, they came near the lair of a dragon so powerful, it struck fear into the hearts of the adventurers. Regaining their composure, they moved into it's lair. The dragon was enormous, by far the largest dragon they had ever seen. And approached them quickly as they entered his lair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mortals, you know nothing of this temple or our history. I can sense in your hearts that you wish to attack me. You will fail. The other dragons you encountered on the way to my lair were just mere servants, and shadowed in comparison to my power. Should you choose to engage me, you should make sure you have everything settled with your god, for you will visit them shortly.&quot; the dragon said as it began to move back deeper into his lair. <br>
<br>
Before it could finish turning around they attacked. It turned and glared at them, it's eyes filled with fiery rage. It unleashed a furious attack on the first target it saw, a Ranger that had yet to attack. The first round of attacks killed the ranger, and with that the dragon said, &quot;Last warning, the next time you try to attack me I will destroy you all.&quot; With that, the clerics gathered together and tried to resurrect the fallen Ranger. They tried for hours to bring him back to no avail. With that, the Ogre took the Ranger's body in his arms and told the wizards to evacuate them out of the temple to the Ranger's home town so that he may bring his body home to his family.<br>
<br>
The Ogre walked up to the steps of the Ranger's family and gave his body to his parents so that he would get a proper funeral. They took 3 days to mourn, and headed back to the temple so they would be able to gain enough power to eventually destroy the dragon that killed their comrade.<br>
<br>
Almost a year went by, and the adventurers were nearly 10 times as powerful as they were when they first met the lord of the temple. They tore through the temple like an Ogre through a banquet meal. And as they entered his lair, the dragon quickly met them at the door. Before he could say anything, they attacked him with everything they had. The fight lasted an exhausting 18 hours. But in the end, the adventurers avenged the death of their old friend. As the dragon died, he did not disperse like the other ones had. He simply lay motionless on the floor. Somewhat as a trophy, the Ogre began to cut off the dragon's head as the proof of the most impressive victory they had ever accomplished, and brought it with him to his estate to remind him of just what could happen when you underestimate the opponent. After all, what joy can you get from victory when you have never known loss. Whether it be the loss of a comrade, or the loss of an entire battle.<br>
