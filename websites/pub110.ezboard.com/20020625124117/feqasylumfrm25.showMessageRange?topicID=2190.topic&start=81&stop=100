I am 47th now and still havetn been to a raid and the first one i signed up on was originally signed up within a 2 week window but then had to be reschecdualed due to conflicting scheduals for the Raidees. Now I dont know how to unsign up for a raid and I wonder what would happen if a respected raid leader planned a raid and then had a Real Life event come up that caused him or her to reschedual and there was no one slots for 3 weeks. So they cancel and cant reschedual? Is that the rule? I am confused and do no want to be blacklisted , so can someone please explain how ANY rule can be set in stone and have NO exceptions? I am sorry for taking up space in the forum but I think that tempers are talking more than facts or rules or community. My opion (for what little it counts as) is that exceptions happen but if a known raid leader does it constantly, THEN you blacklist raid leader and his &quot;followers&quot;. For the record, I will not attend a raid that one of my friends does not recommend. So I guess since the raid in dispute is cancelled, I am out of my first raid. <br>
Maybe by the next raid I can get an invite too, this will have been resolved and everyone can go back to enjoying Raids and EQ.  Thank you all for your time and wisdom in these matters.<br>

<br>
I think it is a good idea to an extent.  However, I have a probelm with blacklisting all attendees of the raid as well as the raid leader.  I think that is going WAY overboard.  No one will ever want to raid or they won't be able to. <br>
<br>
Many people who attend a raid may not pay attention to the raid calendar.  They may just see a post on the boards and want to attend.  On the Lanys Forum that's easy because the schedule in the Raid forum is there, but just not as easily noticed as it is on the calendar.  But some people go to individual guild boards and sign up never thinking to look at the Lanys Raid Calendar.  Now checking the calendar for a raid schedule is a good idea, and I agree that everyone should do it.  However, what people should do and what people do do are two totally different things.<br>
<br>
If you are going to blacklist anyone out of the situation, it should be JUST the raid leader.  It is their responsibility to check the calendar before scheduling the raid.  As well, they should know the rules of the calendar when scheduling the raid.  <br>
<br>
To punish everyone for the carelessness of a few is extremely unfair.  It may end up being that instead of no one raiding with you because they can't, it will be because they don't want to.<br>
<br>
I hope whatever happens, everything works out.  <br>

I will TRY (given my schedule) and talk to EACH raider that signs up so they know they are breaking the rules that govern the calendar. Usually, I see the violation before the signups get too many. <br>
<br>
They are given that chance to back out. If they STILL support the raid knowing they are violating the rules THEN they will be added to my List. <br>
<br>
I don't know how much fairer I can get.<br>
<br>
Personally, when I was a beginning raider I did ALL I can to learn who I was raiding with, when I was raiding, where I was raiding, what rules I had to follow, etc.  <br>
<br>
I did not go to a raid blindly. I can read the rules on the calendar. I can count up to 14 days. I just assumed people did the same when they went to the planes.  /shrug<br>
<br>
I browse the calendar and the raid boards almost daily so I know what days are free and what raids are available. <br>
<br>
This will be MY List of people that violate the &quot;2-week rule&quot;. You don't have to follow my List just like you don't have to respect the calendar. I cannot MAKE anyone respect the calendar. <br>
<br>
The rules are out there for everyone to see. And now... so are the consequences. These are consequences that I (myself) will enforce on MY raids. If other raid leaders browse and uphold my List so much the better. The consequences for ignoring the rules that so many others follow will be heavier. <br>
<br>
IF you make my List, go talk to me. Maybe it was just being a noob raid leader or raider mistake. I'm not inflexible or a total moron. I do understand &quot;things&quot; happen.<br>
<br>
Most of the raids that are posted on the calendar are Old World. And this List will be mostly be for those zones. Plane of Air is probably the only one that needs more than 2 weeks to prepare for as I've said before. But I see more and more that some places such as Kael and HoT are being placed on the calendar. <br>
<br>
The calendar is NOT a reservation system but a communication tool. By posting raids there, we hope that other raid leaders will respect that post and not ruin that raid. Respect and courtesy for raids is something I want to uphold. <br>
<br>
Communication can help solve so many little squabbles. <br>
<br>
As for the &quot;uber&quot; guilds, they are self-sufficient and can pretty much hit any zone anytime they want. I know that some don't even bother with the calendar. The mobs they take are not &quot;call-able&quot;. I don't see how I can do anything about that. All we can do is talk to their raid leaders and come to a compromise.  Usually common decency and respect wins out. <br>
<br>
As to people rushing and getting the same days. WORK IT OUT. You're Raid Leaders... be the example to everyone. <br>
<br>
I'm taking alot of responsibility for this because I think it's worth doing. <br>
<br>
As of right now, I do not have a  List. I hope to NOT have a List.  <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/grayeman/Harne.jpg"><BR>

It took me a couple reads, but I think I managed to get the idea, and I have answers, though likely not answers you like.  You mentioned that Visions (though it could have easily been any of 4-6 guilds) went in and asked your Kael raid to step aside while they killed something.  I am sure they were not after the arena mobs you were wanting to kill, they just wanted to kill one of the bosses, and didnt want to pull through you.  <br>
<br>
I hear the question &quot;Why can't they wait?&quot; and realistically, I have been in 8-10 hour arena raids, and seen often that one arena raid will leave as another comes in.  Over the weekend there is almost always someone there, so if the boss is going to die, someones raid will have to be briefly interrupted.  May as well let the people who want to kill the bosses 'play through' as it were. <br>
<br>
As a rough analogy think about having a line of full shopping carts at the grocery store, and someone with BO comes up who just wants to buy a 6-pack and a loaf of bread.  Most times you just let them go ahead, knowing they wont be there long, and the sooner they are done, the sooner you dont have to smell them anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as other guilds getting to where they are doing the more difficult raids, I dont think thats really a concern yet.  The 4-6 guilds/guildleaders that can manage Ssra, Akheva etc. pretty much work things out between themselves for now. <p><center><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/29/2468929.jpg" border="0">

<br>
I have asked Kael Arena Raiders to step aside on more than one occasion while trying to get Vindi.  Those times I make sure to let the raid leader know well in advance our intentions.  At the very least all it takes is for the raid to move to the other side of the arena for a few minutes while we clear pets and anything that may have repopped in the way.  At the most, it'll take a bit longer to clear to him, and a loss of maybe 10 arena mobs, and for the raid to stand out of the pull path for a bit.  Every time I have talked to the Arena raid leader they have been more than understanding and we try to work things to inconvenience each of our raids as little as possible. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I've been lucky so far, I guess.<br>
<br>
For those that have never fought him, Vindi can wipe out any raid force in seconds if not prepared for the engagement.  It requires precise timing for c-heal rotation and some damn good pulling on the part of the monks to separate his 2 &quot;pets&quot; among other things. (even Visions and FL still get wiped on occasion due to bad pull, having C-heals called a half second too late, pets/Vindi popping on the monk when he stands up, and/or 10 other things... and he is more of less a &quot;trivial&quot; mob to them.  He leaves zero room for error.)<br>
<br>
The last thing I want to do is wipe out 30-40 people in the arena. I also don't want to keep my people waiting hours because the other raid doesn't want to move 100 feet to the left for 30 minutes or less.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, and I'll catch heat for this I'm sure.  But I'll need to agree with Lioneye.  It was determined long ago that this calendar was for &quot;intent to raid&quot; only and was most definately <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a reservation system.  If more than one signed up at the same time on the same day.. noone had any more right to the raid than the other.. work it out.  The Mods were here to enforce the two-week rule and make sure only the agreed to &quot;allowable&quot; raids were posted.<br>
<br>
The &quot;allowable&quot; list was: (still is?) Vox, Naggy, PoH, PoF, PoA, and I think Trakanon.<br>
<br>
Istrahd and the other guild mods are gone, and there is no new calendar mod (that I know of), and I know back when I was still a guildleader this was discussed extensively in the Guildleader Forums. Those im 99% sure were the only raids that were to be sanctioned.  And it was intent.  If ten people wanted to host PoH at noon PST on a sunday.. you 10 had best work it out amongst yourselves.  <p><HR><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20406>Floob Daboob</A><BR>Ogre Oracle<BR><BR><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20462>Caldena Jezebel</A><br> 40 Gnome Rogue <br><BR>Proud Members of <a HREF=http://www.mithrilweb.com/eq/>Mithril Web</A><br><A  HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum> Lanys T`Vyl Server</A><br><a href="mailto:floob@mithrilweb.com">floob@mithrilweb.com</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufyrel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fyrel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/15/02 5:24:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2190.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Blacklist</span><hr size=1> Could this be &quot;tacked&quot; to the top of the Raid Discussion forum?

This post is about calandered raids, which raids are calanderable, and the consequences of disrespecting the calander.  Bitch about uberguilds elsewhere (this is an appropriate place to say that opinions are like assholes, everyone has one).<br>
<br>
This post is just to make you aware that if you post a raid outside the agreed on rules, or if you sign up on a raid that is listed as outside the rules then you will no longer be invited to raid with some of the leading open raid leaders of Lanys.<br>

It all has to do with how they ask the raid to step aside.

And they will say &quot;You were warned.&quot; after whatever they were pulling beats you down.

<br>
The line most telling (in a good way) is his statement that it would be his list and if anyone wanted to go by it fine, but it was just for him.  Of course, since he is well respected as an open raid leader, then it would be good for any one who goes on open raids to at least give it a try not to attend raids posted over two weeks in advance.<br>

I must agree in principal to the system and we must all remember it is Harne's list and by being on it means you don't raid with him anymore. Athough he has given us all right of reply and a fair system of reapproach on that. <br>
<br>
I do however agree with Kaamiin, Harabakc, Mystyx (and a few more) in the knowing of the two week rule. Yes usually it is obvious but doesn't a edit then change that date? Ok a few cases there until they post a list of peeps. If however Harne doesn't BL it straight away and others post then it starts to make it more difficult. Hey yes BL the leader (as suggestd by many peeps) then but if they have the support then there is not alot u can do. This brings the other problem of bouncing around zones picking up extras for a raid, as a druid I have on many occassions zipped about to get peeps to assist. Usually I start with my friends, does this then get them on the BL too. Hey if its on and I wanna go there then by all means lets do it. Sometimes you are short a certain class so its either can raid thus leaving unhappy campers (though most would understand) or chase about for classes....hmm food for thought. Yes and before anyone gets me on this if the raid has been BL and extras are got on the day then unless there is a raid list posted after or Harne is there to see then who is to know you were on it.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your acknowledgement on PoA raids. I myself want to raid there alot and as there are so few open raids there I usually try and get on everyone I can, hmm this could bring me unstuck if its posted early. Infact I intend to start organising raids there and will need support as my guild is a friends type guild and not a big raiding one. I would certainly appreciate have a leeway on the 2 weeks for there.<br>
<br>
I am fairly sure I understand this but like posted by Charse and Rosela, the 2 weeks applies to both calender and forum right? Could one post on the forum an intent for a raid abit earlier then with interest shown then post on calender within the 2 week period?<br>
<br>
Anyway enough said, I too have raided with Harne to Hate and had a great time and learnt heaps. His raid was organised and the instruction clear concise and to the point. His 2 assistance know what they were doing and that was the 1st Hate raid where we actually got to the 2nd floor even without a FD puller. I hope to be able to lead raids as good (maybe even better :-) .. as Harne. For that you have my respect as a Raid leader. Beginner in my case.<br>
<br>
Anyway it comes down to respect and being well mannered to each other. I have no troubles getting on raids usually and hope eveyone else remember to have fun and generally be nice.<br>

IF this becomes a new stamdard considering verant is begining to realize most of the game is camps raids hunting Locations ect if someone comes in Mathi dont flame for this lets say the guild is FL Visions Riders mithril whoever would wanna kill vindi and the raid leader petition or a FAT ammount of people petition say 20 out of 30 raiders petition the gm will likely come in and tell your guild to leave till they are done thats how it is begining to seem to me the gm even asked someone else in karnors if there was a problem with anyother people there wasnt we went back to killing as i said before i agree with harnes post i think its a bit late its valid to be sure but slightly unnecesary although it does post valid points we can all agree with or disagreee its simply a reminder many guilds raid on their own calender as guilds become bgger and stronger and rely on their own calend this raid board isnt gonna do a lot of good if say Inevitable Mithril Glade Fallen and visions ALl schedule Kill vindi on the 15th of whenever at 6pm annd also waiting for other guilds to be done isnt a bad thing Vindi and tormax and whoever they will be there and generaly unmolested on a regular basis missing the chance to kill him once is not the end of the world and mathi i agree with some points in your last post my conclusion here that imtrying to reach<br>
<br>
I believe for the calendar to work to avoid the blacklisting and misshaps EVRYONE who plans to raid something no matter how large or small should post the calendar s for everyone or it is for no one I dont see why the big deal in someone taking 10 seconds to type out example only here Fallen Legacy Guild only Raid on SSRA temple 8pm April 20th<br>
is that REALLY so hard to do NO Is Harne right on his decision YES everthing but blacklisting you made it sound like Oh George is on that raid BLACKLIST HIM NOW FOREVER MUAHAHAHAHAHA the calandar can work as much as we make it to work this is the first SERIOUS issue ive really seen in a few years <br>

<br>
You refer to having a posted raid effectively 'claiming' the arena or whatever, and being able to petition to have another guild raid removed.  This is already possible, the rules are already in place.  It should work nicely if two posted PoH or Fear reaids bump into each other and can't work it out, as a GM will tell one or the other to go away.<br>
<br>
If you are in the arena and killing arena mobs for armor and faction etc. (standard arena raid, been to more than my share) then you are not generally claiming the Vindicator, Tormax or AoW.  If you decide to claim you are there for say, Vindi, just to get another raid to not come through the arena then a GM will give you a certain amount of time to 'shit or get off the pot'.  After that, if you haven't backed your claim then the GM will see to it that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> your</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> raid moves out of the way to give the other raid a chance at the mob they want.<br>
<br>
It is not the bigger guilds fault that the game puts the boss mobs in the middle of stuff that smaller raids like to kill, and generally the bigger guilds will work things out with people first, then (after talking to the other raid leader as was mentioned above) they will shout a warning to everyone in the zone (including people who may or may not be raiding).<br>
<br>
A GM will enforce your 'claim' on a mob or set of mobs that you are raiding, but will not back your claim to a zone if you have no ability to take the boss(es) of the zone.  It is always better just to show a little respect to other raids and let them move through.  They will be out of your way as quickly as they can.<br>
<br>
This entire thread is basically about respect.  Funny thing about respect, you have to show it to receive it, and Harne is doing a great job. <p><center><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/29/2468929.jpg" border="0">

<br>
I have tried avocating that Forums and Calendar be the on the same 2-week rule. What's the point of having one on 2-week and not the other?<br>
<br>
This is the thread I started on it:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showMessage?topicID=2019.topic">pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylu...2019.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Some argued that 2 weeks is not enough time. But again, I disagree. Two weeks is plenty for most zones (POA probably being the only exception). If you cannnot do it in 2 weeks, you need more practice being more efficient and organizing. <br>
<br>
I know of some guilds that post on their OWN boards 3 to 4 weeks in advance THEN place it on the Lanys Raid boards when the 2 week mark hits. <br>
<br>
We have to abide with the same 2 week rule on the Raid Forums so that there is fairness on the posting of raids. There is no &quot;jumping&quot; and &quot;cutting&quot; in line. <br>
<br>
Post FIRST on the Raids Forums so there is a time stamp. THEN post on the Lanys calendar and add the link for the Raid Forums post. This makes for a neater, cleaner presentation and easier signups when people click on the link.<br>
<br>
I would like even closed raids to be posted on the Raid Forums. Even a little blurb saying that it's a closed raid would be nice just to have a time stamp. I think there will be less disputes if everyone posts the same way. Don't shortcut something that is easy to do and will benefit the community in the long run.<br>
