Second the forwarding to the VI guy would simply start a investigation that would lead back to people saying for him to threaten him this would be construed as a bigger harassment. this all according to System Gm Lyd an idiotic thing to do.<br>
<br>
Third as someone in and around the Law Enforcement field anyone nutty enough to carry out threats when they know your armed would be better prepared Ive seen reports of people saying &quot;I have a shotgun and i can defend myself&quot; found themselves going to family funerals because someone with a long range rifle and scope was hired for a mere 2k in cash or drugs who couldnt be Legaly traced back to the client and the victim without family knowing they caused the death of their spouse and children I wouldnt want that guilt. <br>
<br>
Glock and S&amp;W in terms of weapons thats like a stick from a tree and a ball of mudliving near a redneck Pot growing heavy zone those things are toys the kids play with considering for 1500 bucks you can buy a 1 mile range rifle and scope and for 300 dollars you can have untracable ammo made. Go ahead and taunt someone when you and your loved ones end up dying or dead and people ask you why? Your answer better be alot better than &quot;I pissed off an asshole who may have been blowing off steam for shits and giggles and told him to try to come hurt me&quot;<br>
<br>
               I like Tarot and im friends with Uzz, I think uzz could handle things better but im not his parent so his actions until they cross me in some heinous way im not gonna give a flying fuck up a running squirrel's ass about some post saying he did something bad to less than 10% of the server population.<br>
<br>
         If i ever got so mad id threaten someone and was willing to carry it out id do something vindictive like not killing the person id put em in a wheelchair quadropol style no use of arms and legs paraly or sit on the roof across from their kids school and put a silenced bullet through their car when they were away from it right through the winshield where their family would have sat as a warning. these are things ive gotten from Police reports from SFPD and San jose PD police reports as examples so my question to those who ask for Uzz or anyone else to threatan them could you live with yourself if someone capable of what i described came for you or your family because you asked them to? I know I couldn't. people have killed and hurt people for less provocation an Ex alchy/druggy is a prime canidate to snap if you ever really got to him.<br>
<br>
 Sorry for the grim post I feel it better to warn people about taunting possibly the wrong kind of people in general I dont want to see any board messages with &quot;We mourn the loss of &lt;PlayerX&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/umonocot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>monocot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Eashen of the Sky </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/11/02 7:00:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2618.topic&index=133>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: UZZIELL  !

I PREVAILED and WILL continue too </span><hr size=1> The e-mails are confirmed as coming from Uzziell. He sent me 3 e-mails, which amazingly stopped when I replied and told him that his e-mails were traceable. I also had someone else trace the e-mails for me, and they are from him. (Thanks Leo)<br>
<br>
They all originated from his IP, which matched the IP of his EZboard account Uzziell, and his alt EZboard account pyschopath. It came from him. They're not spoofed. (Frankly I don't think he's bright enough to spoof anyway).<br>
<br>
Uzziell also has a long history of making RL threats to people,which is documented on the shitlist. His threats in this situation were intentionally &quot;vague&quot;, which is why I challenged him to make it more specific. His intimidation tactics are designed to frighten and upset people, but he attempts not to cross that legal line, at least now. His threats in game to the one person I'm aware of were far more specific and violent. Unfortunately this was prior to the /report command for that person.<br>
<br>
He's about as effective in that as he is with his flaming though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My statements were intented to show that while he's made threats in the past in an attempt to intimdate people, it's not gonna work. I'm not intimidated, and it's foolish to threaten people. I made him aware that I have home protection and am not really going to lose sleep over his childish crap. I think it's obvious that I don't especially like or appreciate attempts to threaten me or others, even when they're as insane and as stupid as Uzziell's were.<br>
<br>
Do I think Uzziell is on the way to my house? Nope. Do I think he's a complete psycho? Yeap. Does he have a history of threatening people? Yeap. And given his mental instability which he's demonstrated more than once AND the fact that he's threatened people before...it's not something I take lightly. <br>
<br>
Additional steps have been taken beyond notifying VI. There's zero reason to get into what those are publically. The only reason VI was notified is Uzziell's history of this (read the shitlist he was making RL threats back in 2000 too) so they have further documentation of his actions. Which is the reason I posted the contact information for VI so it's all sent to the same person. <br>
<br>
Should anyone wish to take additional steps of contacting his ISP for TOS violations, or contacting law enforcement regarding his actions, that's up to them, and they can make their own judgement call on it based on their experiences. <p><a href="http://marian333.livejournal.com" target="_blank">

<br>
Ah well, to simplify:<br>
<br>
Uzzi joins a guild, Uzzi acts like an ass.  People will start to not like Uzzi's guid because by not taking an action against the shit he does would, in essence, be condoning such behavior.  <br>
<br>
This is why so many guilds can attest to Uzzi.  They've been there, and had to take action of some sort because he was being an ass and damaging the reputation of the guild.<br>
<br>
If you join the Guild of such an ass you are essentially condoning the behavior of Uzzi.  If you, somehow, do not know of Uzzi's reputation (i.e. total noob), you soon will.<br>
If you still stay in said guild, you will be held in the same regard.<br>
<br>
You may not be an psychotic asshole, but by associating with a psychotic asshole you are saying that's it's perfectly fine to do the things he does. <br>
<br>
That's why people are blacklisting Nocturnal Redemptions.  They don't like that you condone all the hurtful things he's done to many, many people.<br>
