Yay!</span><hr size=1> Okay, I have a ranger alt named Kirsdarke that I'd REALLY like to start playing more often, so I have some basic questions that spread across the whole spectrum.<br><br>I will be using some of Kilwen's responses to these questions as a base. If you have something to add or disagree with, post post post!<br><br>At level 22, I get several interesting spells. One of them is Firefist. Now, on many occasions I've read that this is a totally useless spell. One person has said that Firefist only works if you're not wielding a weapon in your primary. I find that hard to believe. My impression on Firefist is that it is a direct, self-only atk buff (the first you get, I suppose). Kilwen has told me that it DOES work while wielding weapons in both hands, and that it is a good idea to have it up. Do/did yall bother with it when you got? Why or why not?<br><br>Tangling Weeds and Snare. This is a big one for me. I prefer not to have both up at the same time, as I like to use that extra slot. Atm I have Tangling Weeds up, but I notice that (1) it seems to have a longer recast time and (2) I think it gets resisted more, unless the mob is already running. The casting time is ungodly (I literally said holy fuck, out loud, the first time I ever used it). Snare doesn't seem to be resisted as much when cast in a fight. Kilwen wasn't really much help on this one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Root. When do you use this? When I'm soloing, I use this to split my pulls alot. I know it only really gives me about ten seconds of split time, but still... Also, if I need to, Tangling Weeds+Flame Lick+Root has absolutely no problem taunting the mob from another PC (including sks /poke Kil). I also like to use this to allow the warrior to regain agro fast in a fight. I just root it and back off a little, letting the warrior gain instant proximity agro. I can usually still hit the mob and the warrior WILL NOT lose agro until it breaks or wears off. Any other uses for this that I don't know about?<br><br>Hawk Eye and its entire line of spells. Should I always have this up? My tentative guess is yes, especially in the high end game, where bows do such sick sick damage. Unfortunately, it only seems to last five minutes, meaning (1) a permanent spot on my slots (BLEH), and (2) a big mana sink. I don't know if this gets better with time. What do you guys say?<br><br>Fletching. Should I get right to work on it? Again, Kilwen says that unless I need the arrows badly, this is a skill that can wait a level or forty. I'm not so sure. What did you others do, and would you do it the same way?<br><br>Emergency tanking. What's the best way you've found to instantly get a mob off the chanter/cleric/etc. So far my best solution, like above, is Flame Lick+Tangling Weeds+Root, all cast quick as possible. Any other suggestions? What's a fast way to get MULTIPLE mobs on me if I need to? Do any of you guys use AE spells for that?<br><br>Spellcasting DPS. Kilwen says the first time I will EVER get any valuable dps out of damaging spells is with Call of Flame. Is this true? What about dots, does anyone use them? If so, which ones? What are the most efficient spells?<br><br>Pulling. How do you guys do this? I started out using Flame Lick, but I stopped using it pretty quick when no one could get the mob offa me when I brought it to camp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Once again, Kilwen suggests using Dispel (which I don't have) or arrows to pull. Suggestions?<br><br>Foraging. This has GOT to be the most frustrating skill I have EVER come into contact with! Is there any way to raise this fast, or am I just stuck waiting one minute and mashing Forage?<br><br>Thats about all I can think of right now. I love being a ranger, but since all of my time in EQ has been spent as a warrior, I really find that I have alot to learn. Any help yall can give would be appreciated. Thanks in advance <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Tamorfin, Warrior<br>Kirsdarke, RANGER!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ualadinsaneuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aladinsaneuk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Xerkizh the Creator </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/12/02 1:28:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumranger.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=715.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.petedean.btinternet.co.uk/aladstyle.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ranger questions!

Yay!</span><hr size=1> well to cover what Alad didn't..<br><br>The first DD you get worth much in the damage department is Careless Lightning, it doesn't take much mana and does 99 damage, it's a very decent nuke until 49, although the Call of Flame quest was something I never did, I just waited till 52 and got firestrike.  But even then unless you have c2 or KEI or something it's not very wise to blow all your mana nuking.  <br><br>Hawk Eye is kinda useless until you get trueshot, doesn't really help much because you don't really need your bow much till then sip for pulling.<br><br>Fletching, I would get to work on this right away, though you don't have to get serious with it, just use it to fletch gimpy arrows, it's rather cheap early on.<br><br>When pulling, just use your bow until 51, then use jolt when you don't want aggro, use flame lick when you do.  Best spells for pulling lowest aggro are ones that do no instant damage.  Snare works for pulling too, but it draws aggro, so don't pull with snare unless you want aggro or are 51+ and can jolt it off.<br><br>Best way to get INSTANT aggro from anyone, is rooting it and getting right in the mobs face, while it's rooted hit it with flame lick and snare/tangling weeds, you'll have aggro until the mob or you are dead.<br><br>Firefists is a self ATK buff, exactly like the SK/necro counter part, Grim Aura (yes what's on the Shurkien Earring).  So it effects whatever you're using, even if it's your bare hands.  Use this till you get that new luclin self ATK buff, or 51 when you get SoN.<br><br> <p><img SRC="http://www.fcguild.com/eq_sigs/eq_sig_acbe.jpg"></br>Arceri Brink</br>59th Outrider of Surefall Glade</br></br>Brenil Seropian</br>56th Defiler -- Gone Drinkin'</br><br><br>"....Excuse me, while I...whip this out..."</br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uraethorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raethorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Innoruuk </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/12/02 2:52:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumranger.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=715.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ranger questions! Yay!</span><hr size=1> It's a little hard to address a lot of your questions because they largley involve things that have changed since I was your level.<br><br>There's no reason not to have firefist up, it works with whatever type of attack you're using except spells.<br><br>Snare maybe more reliable then tangling weeds to stop runners but it's a very good spell and I wish I had more practice with it from lower levels. I usually have both memorized when fighting the small mushrooms in FG but I don't have root memorized in that situation.<br><br>When I was your level root overwrote snare so I never used it. Again I could have used the practice of aggro management with this. It would also help those you fight with to get used to working with proximity aggro from root.<br><br>Tangling weeds, flamelick and taunt are probably all you'll ever need to gain aggro. You can add snare for that extra amount of aggro or substitute it for tangling weeds. We only get one ae that I'm aware of and I don't think it carries much aggro. Remember that even a spell which cannot land still adds aggro, so you can cast tangling weeds on a snared mob to gain aggro.<br><br>I don't think Tangling weeds is resisted more then snare, it's probably the same resist depending on how many levels ago you were able to scribe it.<br><br>Root can be used for CC but I don't find it very reliable personally. Maybe if I had more practice using it this way I'd have better results because some rangers seem to be very effective at CC.<br><br>I kept my fletching skill up along with my archery skill from bowkiting. I'd do it the same again if I had the time between leveling which I imagine I wouldn't.<br><br>Efficient dps with spells is hard to achieve before call of flames if not impossible. We are however as hybrids able to use the delay between swings to cast without having the weapon delay reset. Even so I wouldn't use a lot of DD or DoT's during melee. I never found DoT's to be very mana efficient but I fizzled more with them then other types of spells also.<br><br>Flamelick is good for pulling because it casts so quickly. Arrows are less aggro and even faster. If pulling in high traffic areas the added aggro is good because there's less chance it will go after the meditating caster in a group you pull close to. The extra beating you take from the aggro of flamelick shouldn't be a problem until later when you'll have more options. For instance I've used jolt to pull. Often times what you use to pull is situational.<br><br>I got into the habit early on to hit the forage key after every kill if the button was ready. Some I know stop melee long enough to forage while fighting. I'm always switching out gear and weapons during a fight even now though so that was never really an option for me. Have the button on your main bank of hotkeys and hit it whenever it's ready, that should keep the skill maxed. I have a sit hotkey right next to it right below sense heading and just after track. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p><center><img src = http://nilsig.homestead.com/files/Raetseig.gif></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/utranthas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tranthas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cheshire Tank</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/12/02 3:28:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumranger.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=715.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ranger questions! Yay!</span><hr size=1> Firefist:  Keep it up until 51, when you get Strength of Nature (which doesn't stack with Firefist).<br><br>Tangling Weeds and Snare: try to imagine a mob that can escape before Tangling Weeds can cast.  I can't think of one either.  <br>(Disclaimer: I was 55 when this spell was added to the game, so I haven't used it a whole lot myself.)<br><br>Root: sounds like you're using this one quite well enough. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Hawk/Falcon/Eagle Eye: Affects archery accuracy.  Put it up when firing your bow, but you don't need it any other time.  Personally, I cast it just before using Trueshot and that's it.<br><br>Fletching: makes archery practice much easier, but you don't need to concentrate a great deal on getting this up unless it appeals to you for its own sake.<br><br>Emergency tanking, Flame Lick and AE spells:  First off, we get 1 (one) AE spell.  It's called Invoke Lightning, it does 25 damage in a 40-range radius, and that doesn't pull high-end mobs off anything, so scratch that one.  I Ensnare the living bejeezus out of stuff to get its attention, usually -- but realistically, if there are many mobs to tank, don't get in the habit of pulling them all onto yourself unless you need practice looting your corpse.  We aren't built to take massive damage from five sources.<br><br>Spellcasting DPS:  No.  You do more damage with melee than with any spell except Call of Flames.<br><br>Pulling:  First, if you're outdoors:  Harmony is your friend.  The old Temple of Cazic Thule throne room made an excellent training ground for Harmony-pulling, but alas, that's gone.  <br><br>I pull with Cancel Magic when I can, and arrows when I can't.  I use Harmony when possible to prevent too many adds, and Camouflage to prevent mobs from finding me before I'm ready.<br><br>Foraging: You're stuck waiting, but the skill recycles a little faster at higher skill levels.

It gives you enough time to start to run, but you will not loose the mob, and the main tank will take aggro quicker than if you have used snare.<br><br>Personnally, I always use tangling weeds and snare. There is always someone else to root, and their spells last longer than mine.<br><br>Hawk eye and the other archery spells are useful if you try to do bow kitting.

Cast it a billion times, because when you hit Level 54 and get Jolting Blades, you'll need 170 Conjuration to use the spell effectively.<br>EDIT:  The 30 spell in question is Stinging Swarm, but it's a very inefficient use of mana for us anyway.  At 54 we get Drones of Doom as well as Jolting Blades, but Drones isn't really worth it either.<br><br>Glimpse is similarly helpful for Superior Camouflage at 49, which will fizzle a lot until your Divination is over 150. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=180731>Tranthas Stormwalker</a><br>60 Warder of Tunare<br>Avatar of <a href=http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=2196>Second Covenant</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/utranthas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tranthas</A> at: 6/14/02 6:57:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ualadinsaneuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aladinsaneuk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Burrower Parasite </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/14/02 6:45:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumranger.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=715.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.petedean.btinternet.co.uk/aladstyle.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ranger questions!

Maybe I should take up fishing since I can't use them for ammo anymore (Twang!

Flame lick, thorn coat, skin like kleenex, pitiful heal, and my swap out slot are the others.  That is for soloing, I will probably choose to keep both snare and tangling weeds up for a while though, simply because they are each intensely useful spells in their own way (and my main went 60 levels with no snare, snare is an amazing spell to me).<br><br>For now I have forage in the place cannibalize is on my shaman, I don't think I ever miss a pop.  Snare has replaced slow, flame-lick is where a mal-line spell would be, root is still root, heal is still heal (worthless as it is) and my buff / swap spots are the same.  I probably wont use the low-end DoTs much, simply because with the gear I have I really dont think they will add much to my damage, at least not in these levels.<br><br>I cant bind forage to a move key as I am afraid that would interfere with the hotkey setup on the main and my other alts.<br><br>Mostly if I have questions I pester Aladinsane or Alrik, they seem to have a huge patience for putting up with my noobishness.  /hugs guys<br><br>Rikkiti Kittavi <br>Human Ranger of Karana <br>Yep Human.
