<br>
    Is there anyway to prove it was him or it wasnt his brothers sisters cousins RL friends cat, no.  However judging from his actions and his past history being mixxed with a really nice person and an annoying demon from hell, its believable to me.  Sure u all can just jump on the &quot;Hes lying, we all know it cause the guy who posted right before me says so&quot; bandwagon, but if your such perfect people to judge perhaps you could give him a chance to see if hes changed or reverted back to his troublesome history.<br>

So perhaps I can fill in some blanks.<br>
The first time Grekon was in our guild he was fine for a few weeks.  He then told me he was going on overseas duty for the military.  Soon Gekon was logged on and being an ass so I disbanded him.<br>
A month (maybe) later Grekon approached me and apologized.  He said that while he was gone his nephew and teenage son were playing his account.  He said that he had changed his password and we wouldn't have any future problems.  So, I reinvited him to our guild.  Again he was fine for a few weeks.  Then said he would be going away again.  The first time Grekon was logged on after this, he was an ass.<br>
So I again disbanded him.<br>
Was this one person all the time? Who knows.  Was it a character highjacked by some teenage assholes?  Who knows.<br>
I just know he will not get another chance with our guild.<br>

Other times he would be totally polite about it. I have recently put him and every one of his alts on ignore. I guess i am ussing this board to get the message to Grekon, whichever person is on him ATM, i miss ya man, but till something changes and its YOU at the PC i think, as the SL states, its best to stear clear of you ATM.<br>

Sent me a tell a week or so ago when i ran into him in a zone saying &quot;i still don't understand why you don't believe that my brother's nephew's cousin was playing my account.&quot; Well it appears his distant relative's undead donkey is still playing it. Heres a new funny story about this winner:<br>
<br>
He showed up in zone when we were setting up for our Fear raid Saturday. He managed to get into a group despite my protests (which may not have been heard as I was in and out of LD). Well the two break groups go in, and this guy is in group four, not one, not two, but four. About one minute after the break groups go in this little dwarf takes off into the portal and is promptly killed. The groups were busy being wiped.<br>
<br>
He is eventually removed from his group for being a complete moron and for raid safety (with plans to rez and TL him out when we get the zone under control, which we never do). He manages to get back to the zone somehow and I can't recall but I think he ran in again like a little retard while there was nobody in there and we were organizing a CR. Eventually I remember seeing him in summoned armor outside of the fear portal.<br>
<br>
Then earlier today I am sitting around in DL waiting for a friend when I see him /oocing about this or that being completely annoying. Then i get a tell from a member of QofH asking who Grekon is, I ask why and he says he's in our ally channel (we have one open to chat and set up groups and its PW protected). He is unguilded and is NOT under consideration for joining either guild. This person tells me that Grekon says he is being interviewed to join CoP (once again he is NOT). I send him a tell and ask him how he got the PW and of course his anonymous friend gave it to him. I chew him out for it a bit then let it drop after I can't find out who did it.<br>
<br>
About an hour later he sends me a tell all chummy like saying &quot;So if you ever need any help with anything let me know, i'm here for you.&quot; I couldn't even send the response i had typed out for him it was that cruel.<br>
<br>
To sum this up YES he is still being a richard cranium and continue to avoid him, if he runs into the fear portal on a wim who knows what he would do if the raid had actually gone on. <p><center><IMG SRC="http://chie_tygress.tripod.com/Everquest/neogreen.jpg

to give grekon his due - i think it is the original grekon back, and he is trying to restore his name.<br>
<br>
with regard to fear - i think that was probably ignorance about what can happen if u do that.... i have to be honest, i missed it as i was either <br>
<br>
(a) putting my head between my knees and kissing my botty good bye, or<br>
<br>
(b) admiring the wonderful architecture of the nexus....<br>
<br>
finally - to be in our ally channel was a touch naughty....<br>
<br>
all said and done, i wish him well at recoveriing his reputation, though i do think it will be a very hard job.... <p><center>
