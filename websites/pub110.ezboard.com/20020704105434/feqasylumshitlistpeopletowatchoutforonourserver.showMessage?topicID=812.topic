Lugorr offered to help me co lead this raid. Being this was first time Leading and I was told he could be trusted I said sure. The Raid was Sweet Naggy went down and it was time to loot. Well Lugorr started to Loot Naggy and before he was done looting him He disbanded from the group. He did admit that the monk bag was on naggy. But we wasn't sure so we checked with a GM to see what else dropped. We found out he ninja looted the Red Dragon Scale. Well we talked to the gm about this and his guild&lt;which I will not mention and if you know it please don't say anything about who they are&gt; He did give back the scale and got booted from his guild. He was also suspended from EQ. But I just wanted you all to know what happen and warn you on any future raids he may lead.<br><br>On a side note Congrats to Kiseki who won the scale Sirrdoser was there when I rolled it.<br><br>                              Hinokaze 52 Ronin Ranger lanys <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukdor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kdor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/4/02 8:25:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=812.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lugorr Level 52 Warrior</span><hr size=1> Damn.

He comes to meet me but doesn't give me the money i ask him about it and he makes a joke about spending it on hookers and booze... <br><br>It was the end of the night so we all get TL'd out...He to WC me to Nektulos...I send him a tell Hey man, i really need to get my money...meet me in EC will only take 2 minutes.. His reply sorry man i've really got to log now...i'll give it to you next time you're on<br><br>3 days go bye and i see him...I ask him where's my money and no reply.  I get my guild leader involved and finally he sends me a tell saying that he spent my 1k because he "got a good deal" but he will replace it.<br><br>I have the patience of a saint...so i'm told but i started to get a little peeved.  I told him okay..get the money to replace it in 3 weeks time...I was headed to florida the next morning for 3 weeks.<br><br>I come back and it's another week before I see him again..still no money just more excuses.. This time i get his guild leader at the time involved.  It takes another month, but through constant pressure from his guild leader...my guild leader and me i finally get my cash back.. After I left a velks group to meet the guy in thurg.<br><br>I was so tempted to come here with his name...however this is a last resort and I figured my conflict with him was resolved..However, I am not suprised to see him up here...<br><br>Another thing of note...This guy changes guilds more often than some people change underwear...he's been in four different guilds since January.

And Ninjalooting the Red Scale ( even though he did eventually give it back, congrats to the winner btw ), will definatly tarnish my view of him.. <br><br>The fact that he has done this type of thing before bumps him down to threatingly with me.  I certainly won't be joining any groups / raids he is on or leading.<br><br>You know, you would think that by 52 someone would know better?!?  I mean at 20 I can at least see thinking you might get away with it, then realizing later what a mistake it was and never doing anything like that again.. I'm sure on Penni I did one or two things that I wouldn't even THINK about doing now when I was like 15.  But come on, I'm only 48 on Penni, and I have known better than to do this kind of crap since MANY levels ago, how can you get to 52 and not know any better?  <br><br>At 15 you might not realize the real impact that being SLed has, but at 52 surely you realize that because of this you will now NEVER get your epic, and more likely than not NEVER get on a major raid of any kind again?!?<br><br>Thats just.. dumb..<br> <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.sharkdivers.com/kesri/images/kesrisig.jpg"><BR><BR>Alluring Enchantress<BR>Mistell Queen / Agent of SANOKA</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthedukeofnuke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Duke Of Nuke</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/5/02 11:00:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=812.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lugorr Level 52 Warrior</span><hr size=1> Lugorr....<br><br>/sigh<br><br><br>What the hell were you thinking?<br><br>/ponder <p><p><center><img src=http://eqgraphics.50megs.com/images/DukeSignature.jpg><Br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugarudorghostwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garudor Ghostwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/5/02 11:04:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=812.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lugorr Level 52 Warrior</span><hr size=1> Damn...I was on that raid.  First dragon raid ever, I was personally invited by Lugorr.  I was only level 41 or so, too.  I got there, everyone grouped up and we headed in.  Everything went very smoothly...only a few deaths.  I was also the only Shaman on the raid, so it took a while to buff everyone up, but once that was done, we headed in and spanked Naggy.  <br><br>When he announced the loot, he told us that there were two pairs of Gauntlets of Fiery Might, a Hierophant's Crook, and some other crap loot.  Everyone voiced their displeasure, but he said that his group saw him loot.  No one accused him of anything.  Anyways, it was after a patch, so we headed down to spank Vox, but I went LD before we could group up, so that was my whole experience.<br><br>I'm very disappointed that he's up here.  He always seems nice enough...a little loot hungry maybe (When he heard I might be quitting, he kept asking for my stuff...especially my Lodi).  He also told me he was also going to quit, but that day, maybe the next, he won a Thurgadin Plate BP, so decided to stay.  Anyone know if this has anything to do with the scale?<br><br>Sorry if I didn't make this very clear...I know to me it just seems like a jumble of random stuff.

It's like I said even thou this issue was resolved I just wanted everyone to be warned because I knew this was another raid that he was leader on. I took this up with the gms because we all thought it was funny that 3 raids in a row&lt;only 2 I knew lugorr was on&gt; didn't have cloak of flames or red scale drop. The fact that he disbanded from his group made us want to check. It's just in the future I don't want people to get screwed when they go on naggy raids and he's leading them. <br><br>As for as finding out it was his cousin playing I did find that out when the gms talked to him. But the GMs did say that didn't make a difference. He shouldn't let other people play his character if that is the case. Normally you can get ban for ninja looting but he didn't he has his first warning. I don't think he'll do it again but to be sure that's why I posted this here. <br><br>                            Hinokaze Level 52 Ronin Ranger of Layns <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hinokazeeq>Hinokazeeq</A> at: 4/6/02 1:59:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uneutronicbear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NeutronicBear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/6/02 2:15:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=812.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lugorr Level 52 Warrior</span><hr size=1> Normally I don't post here.
