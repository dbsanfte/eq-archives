CT has gone from the zone that was totally empty because it was ultrascary, to the zone where people go for some of the best xp there is for a well equipped high level group. CT xp is absurd, and that is the real loot of the zone. There are some modest to extremely nice drops there, but the reason to go to CT is the xp... loot drops are just gravy. CT is a little stingy on the nice drops and named spawns, you will typically only see a few per long xp camp...<br>
<br>
specific areas:<br>
<br>
the entrance and CY consists of two guards at the first door. You can do these guards and *cautiously* pull parts of the CY with a duo or trio. Until it is broken, patience and situational awareness is the watchword, because pulls of more than two or three are typically quite fatal. I usually kill this area while killing time waiting for the rest of the group to show up. The two guards are melee lizards, and in the CY there are a couple patrolling raptors and a few lizards guarding around the rim of the CY. I do *not* suggest chanter pulling these mobs. I've done it, and managed to pull it off for a little bit, but these mobs hit so hard they will blow through bedlam and get to your soft squishy center very quickly making you dead if you get bashed and stunned. A lot of chanter pulling is level aggro and range, and neither of those things are too applicable in the CY. You can also pull some maze to the entrance. I like to leave the pulling to a better armored and more generous with HP class though, it is not something I feel confident doing, because the margin of error is so small.<br>
<br>
Throne Room. You can set up camp in any of three places here for the TR. You can set up in either of the two corners (( two spawns to potentially add )), the left corner is best because I've never seen &quot;Enraged Shiverback&quot; in the gorilla spawn on the left side, only on the right side. You can also set up in the hall, there are no spawns there, but the initial break is much harder, because you have to deal with both sides of the TR at the same time, this means three to five mobs in the initial pull, rather than two. I've held camps in all these places, and I like the left corner best, mostly from old habit, but also because I like the pathing and the long lead time that you get casting mez from mobs charging out of the TR itself. The hall is also very viable, if you have smart tanks who give you lots of information and a smart puller... because you do not have visibility seeing what mobs are coming, so you need to be informed by text. In the TR there are melee lizards, diciples, spiritcaller, judicators, shiverbacks, enraged shiverbacks, and a couple of named spawns. All of the lizards are stunnable/entranceable, as well as the shiverbacks. The enraged shiverback is 56, and is GoK only. The named are also 56+. These have special names like silverflank shiverback, thule ew templar etc... they are easy to distinguish from the other mobs. The named in TR drop icky (( +3 to resists globe )) to modest (( 10AC 10WIS druid bracer )) very nice (( 31 percent monk haste sash with spiffy stats )) (( nec/mag click summon companion belt )). The named have special attacks, one flurries, another rampages. They don't seem to do it much, but when I hear a name up, I load crip just for the heck of it. All of the 56+ mobs enrage, and this is the habit of mobs in CT.<br>
<br>
Fishies. In the blue pool area, there are a number of fish. These fish hit form 200-250, have decent hp, but also drop some nice stuff and are good xp. This is underwater fighting with all the fun stuff that entails: basically once a mob is actively beating on you, your chance of channeling off spells is dramatically reduced because you are moving around a lot more in the water than you would in on land. But the fishies have poor magic resist, like most of the mobs in CT, so you don't get hit much. Once the fishies have been exhausted, you can pull the gooes from the old gator area. Sometimes you can snag the ooze covered ritualist as well. Named fishes drop a nice 1hb, a modest 15/31 poker and a couple other things I've heard. It makes for an interesting and exciting camp, because people don't get a chance to do underwater fighting often. As long as your puller is sturdy and has good swimming you shouldn't have much of a problem. While I've been there, I've always GoKed everything, so I don't have entrance/gok information on the various spawns, but I bet that the smaller ones are entrance and the large greenbloods are GoK.<br>
<br>
Gooes. These gooes are up from the blue pool area, I like setting up right near the blue pool. There is one spawn there, usually &quot;an ooze&quot;, and you can usually avoid aggroing the next goo up if your camp is tight. The oozes come in ooze, swirling ooze and pool of slime varieties, and I think I recall there being a named ooze down there as well. ooze are easy, swirling ooze are a bit more difficult, and pool of slime are quite difficult and are GoK only. pool of slime also enrages. Because of the similarity of model and how easily the gooes stack, targetting is an utter pain in the ass, so a puller that will work with you splitting the mobs for targetting is a godsend. The most effective way i've seen is for the fd puller to run off and get a couple, and the MT go and pull off one with an arrow or aggro spell, and then have you mez the rest, moving a bit as each one is mezzed for easier targetting. These are VERY good xp, but I can't make myself do them for more than a couple hours because it gets rather nervewracking with the targetting and the monotony. I like the lizards better, because there is more variety.<br>
<br>
Maze. The maze is fun fun to crawl, and non-60 groups do good here, because the mobs don't wander around it much, so the encounters are broken up into managable bites, there are some open areas of the maze with multiple spawns in them, but they are easy to split and handle. Most everything in the maze is entranceable lizards and spiders, the exception being a brown spawn lizard at the temple with the baby cazic thule hood ornament on it and the four little lizards on it, and the unusually named yellow spider and probably any named that frolick through the maze. When I do the maze I typically take all rights or all lefts or some easy formula, so if someone gets out of sight of the group, there is a preplanned way that they can follow.<br>
<br>
4c. Ugh. I've only been here once with a two group adventure, and it was ultranasty. There was a named brown lizard that chealed and was RAPTURE only, which means I had to seive it down and it had a tremendous manapool. I've seen single groups of the finest people on the server go here and wipe fast. This seems to be a two group place, but that will probably change as equipment and tactics evolve.<br>
<br>
Planks. The camp that everyone wants, and which I'm totally sick of. Gooes get very monotonous and unfun after a couple hours, and you are just sitting there waiting for those silly named to spawn. This, of course, is where the FT3 booties drop and the fancy melee earring. It is usually permacamped around the clock, because people are of the opinion that FT3 booties are worth absurd plat. As the number of them on the market has increased, because the camp is permacamped, the price will go down. I've lost on four booties myself, and I'm had my utter fill of the camp myself. There is good xp to be had here, tho. It features the fun gooes from the above, as well as the added wrinkle of lifestealer skeeters. the skeeters are moderatly high MR, GoK only and proc a 200 point lifetap. I just rapture their asses off the bat, tash and root them and switch to GoK. One of the skeeter spawns is rapture only, be aware.<br>
<br>
Dealing with the fun mobs:<br>
<br>
lizards are fairly uniformly low mr and have a goodly amount of HP. They come in warrior, shaman, cleric, and necromancer flavors. The casters also come with two special attacks outside of their spell arsenal. They can either proc a 350 point poison rain with three waves, or proc Bane of Thule, which is a combination slow and 700-ish point dot over ~11 ticks. Since caster changes, the caster mobs in CT *will* cast nasty high level versions of their spells. Shamans will do high level slows, clerics will do group heals etc, necromancers will cast fun spells like Insidious Retrogression, Plauge, Ebolt and Dooming Darkness. Because the mobs are so high level, you can't just count on being 60 and resisting everything, good resists and resist buffs help a lot. The clerics don't seem to like to Cheal as much as cleric mobs typically do, usually casting a string of lesser heals before working up to the big cheal. They also seem to cast an odd heal spell with the message &quot;XXX is healed&quot; that I don't recognize and seems to be fairly close to insta-cast.<br>
<br>
Defenders are high HP, and spiritcallers are low HP.<br>
<br>
The poison rains are *nasty* and positional awareness in your group will do much to help mitigate the damage. People who can get out of range of the ae should be out of it. Same with Bane of Thule, bane of thule is fairly easy to resist, but why put yourself in its range if you can avoid it? The special key to dealing with the lizards with these special abilities is that they are procs. They are dependant on the mobs being able to melee. What I do once the mob is sufficently aggroed is to tash the mob, and then go nuts on it with stuns. I've already slowed it, so if I do happen to draw aggro, it isn't that big of a deal... while the mob is slowed and being stunned, it isn't procing BoT or the rain anymore and this is a big help when you see that fucking rain land three or more times a lizard, and BoT being proced all the time.<br>
<br>
shiverbacks aren't too special compared to lizards other than they have a lot more hp. they don't seem to be any more MR.<br>
<br>
The gooes are not very MR, I have the feeling that resists are more based on level than innate resist of the mob. Gooes are also quite FR, so your nuker(s) should be using cold or magic spells if they have them. The pool of slime can be a bitch to slow, but isn't too hard to mez.<br>
<br>
I've discussed skeeters and fish above.<br>
<br>
Crowd control tactics and group dynamics:<br>
<br>
I don't usually pack a shaman in my groups, so I'm doing the slowing. Slowing most everything is vital to group efficency, but it does you no good to slow a mob, have it aggro on you and then have your cleric burn away all their mana chaining DL on you because you have aggro. I prefer paladins and shadowknights to warriors as my MT in CT, even though that reduces efficency of cheal because of lower AC and HP... because SKs and PALs will get that aggro fast and can mez break perfectly every time with stuns or aggro spells. If you have to have a warrior as MT, I like packing a PAL as the mezbreaker, or an SK to mez break and pull/peel. PALs bring pallywave (( nontrivial considering the poison rains )), rooting, and assorted support healing to the group.<br>
<br>
The key to success in CT, much more so than older dungeons, is DPS DPS DPS. One rogue is good, additional damage melee is better, and epic mages too. This is not a place to bring three knights and expect to get mad xp and clear everything. The DPS just isn't there to meet the mob's HP. Hybrids and mages *do* bring a lot to a group tho, for the hybrid's special buffs and skills, and mages for damage and rodding if it is needed. I've been thrilled to have those rods available if push comes to shove, or just to increase group efficency by bringing mana levels back up.<br>
 <br>
The mob's aggro model here is wierd. They don't mind so much being slowed (( unless you are dumb and sit right down )), nuked, or mezzed, but they REALLY HATE being tashed or stunned. The mobs have low enough MR that I don't even really need to tash them except for the special ones in order to mez or slow them. Once I have them mezzed, I don't even tash them then anymore, just pile the slow on and eat any resists... which don't come that often anyway. They are also touchy on the sit aggro (( not as touchy as HS mobs or Krapnors, tho )), so keep on your toes if you can and sit only when you must, or the current mob is like below 1/2 or it is clear. I'll bounce two slows off a mob and finally lock it, and my mezbreaker will get aggro right away, but mez and just tash a mob, and I've seen it charge for me even after my SK piled like every aggro spell they have on them. So I keep tash stowed away unless it is really needed (( like I have four in camp, repops are due, and I'm down to 10m so any resist is a tragedy )).<br>
<br>
ToT gets very little from the caster mobs, typically just a blip of blue to 1/3 a blue most of the time. It doesn't hurt to have it up, because a blip is better than nothing. Mana management is very important, especially if you are slowing. For lizard areas, I use entrance because the mana savings adds up over time compared to GoK, and only use GoK when I must. My mana situation has improved since I got mastery 2 and FT1/MC1, noticeably. Communicate with your cleric and see if you can get away without slowing a single easy pull if they are at 80 and you are scraping. Not slowing one also means less aggro so you can get some extra asstime in too. I just make sure to let them know when I'm not going to slow so they can time their CH properly.<br>

4c - personally I like it here, mostly because it's an open area and I hate camping corridors BUT the sieving on some browns is a total pain ... I swear I've sieved dragons faster. If you're quick and chain sieve, you may get lucky and the damn thing will only Cheal once <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Pyramid - I would never suggest pulling too much from maze to here without a FD puller who you can afford to stay FD if necessary. The mob pathing can be very nasty - you think you've pulled it in a clean direction, but it or it's partner will race through the alleys and bring 4 or 5 friends with it. And you're risking not only your own group but new groups arriving at the wiz portal. <p>- Mistress Gladriel -<BR>Enchantress of Sigil</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ualluveal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alluveal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I <3 Mistmoore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/9/02 2:14:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumenchanter.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=901.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.alluveal.com/firelady4arm.gif width=60 height=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CT notes</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the tips, guys.

<br>
1. Mob slowing PC<br>
<br>
This is DR check not MR check, so make sure your melee's get DR buffed and or put on their own (black flower-PoM).<br>
<br>
It can be cured with sham legs etc.<br>
<br>
2. Keep memblur on your spell line up, it will save you.<br>
<br>
Usually what I do is mez, debuff, then blur.<br>
<br>
3. Poison rains.<br>
<br>
If a caster lizard gets one off (depending which type cast it) you need to be on your toes. This is from the shaman AE line and it will hit the lizard who cast it so if you mez b/w one of the rains coming down then your mez will break from the lizards own AE.<br>
<br>
4. Sieve/ToT<br>
<br>
ToT I keep just to drain the lizard casters....Sieve depending on which area. We were in the tower and had a frightcasrer I think it was wipe us out. He was getting CH'ed through the ceiling. I ToT'ed this guy 5 times and sieved him about 8 times he casted through the whole fight till we died.<br>
<br>
5. Mez choices.<br>
<br>
Brown lizards will require rapture to lock down. Some however are L60 and cannot be mezzed. Make sure you con them if moving into an area with a lot of them so you know which should be attacked first. (example-blue flame temple past the raptors).<br>
<br>
I usually keep Dazzle, GoK and Rapture all memed when hunting in CT.<br>
<br>
I use mez to interupt the caster type lizards you can usually interupt them 5 or so times before you will take agro off the tank and get summoned. But if you have bedlam on he is slowed not a big deal. Taking agro &lt; chain casting 350 rains b/c the tanks are missing interupt throws.<br>
<br>
6. Agro range.<br>
<br>
In the planks area the goos I noticed have a huge agro range so no wondering off.<br>
<br>
7. Underwater<br>
<br>
Make sure your back is against a wall.<br>
<br>
8. Charming<br>
<br>
Don't even bother, its a waste of time it will bounce on 99% of the mobs.<br>
<br>
9. FD puller types are your friend if you want to get to the good places.<br>
<br>

<br>
oooooor, you could just use a cold or magic nuke and dispense with the debuffing?<br>
<br>
your choice, i see dvisions hit for full 90% of the time on less than level 56 mobs, and dementia hit rather than being resisted about 80% of the time on the same mobs without tashing. 56+ mobs tend to resist more, but I feel that is more level talking that innate magical resist.  <p><center><BR>

Mez resists are often quite painful. Part of what makes CT doable is the low magic resist, if they resisted more, it would be a deathtrap. <p><center><BR>
